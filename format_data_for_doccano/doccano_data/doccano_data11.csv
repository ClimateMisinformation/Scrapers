"Polluting industries around the world are using the coronavirus pandemic to gain billions of dollars in bailouts and to weaken and delay environmental protections. The moves by the fossil fuel, motor, aviation, farming, plastic and timber sectors are described as dangerous and irresponsible by senior figures. Environmental campaigners describe some participants in these industries as “coronavirus profiteers”.  Economic and energy leaders say the unprecedented sums of money being committed to the global recovery are a historic opportunity to tackle the climate crisis and create a safer, more resilient, world. However, such action has been lacking to date, they warn. Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, said: “When I look at different parts of the world I have not seen yet a major emphasis on clean-energy technologies.” He warned of mistakes similar to those made after the 2008 financial crisis when stimulus packages led to the biggest leap in carbon emissions in 50 years, four times greater than the reduction initially seen. “If we put the money in the right place, we can manage the [climate] risk, and have a much more modern, cleaner and safer energy system,” Birol told the Guardian. “But if you put the money in the wrong place we will lock ourselves in a dirtier energy system, making it much more difficult to reach our climate targets.” Rachel Kyte, at Tufts University, US, a former UN special representative for energy and former World Bank Group vice president, said: “Covid-19 puts our economies at a fork in the road. Using public money to bail out firms that will take us on the road which doesn’t accelerate decarbonisation and doesn’t address inequality is not just unaffordable, it’s dangerous.” Unlike in the US, where the Trump administration has rolled back environmental protections, the EU has backed a green recovery. Frans Timmermans, executive vice-president for the Green Deal at the European commission, said: “[Tackling the Covid-19 emergency] cannot and will not throw us off course in our efforts to tackle the climate crisis that still looms large as one of humanity’s most daunting challenges.” “Bailouts should all be linked with clear conditions that the money will be used for a green economy and a green society. The very least that should be done is to ascertain that none of our commitments are used to harm our climate goals.” The nature of the global economic recovery is being shaped with meetings this week of G20 finance ministers and central bankers, and by the World Bank and IMF. Much of the initial financial aid from governments was rescue packages to prevent immediate economic collapse, but further huge sums are expected to build recovery. Laurence Tubiana, CEO of the European Climate Foundation, who was France’s climate change ambassador when the global Paris climate deal was sealed in 2015, said: “We know speed is essential with so many lives and livelihoods at stake, but it would be irresponsible to knowingly lock in more human suffering by enabling more pollution.” Lord Stern, a climate economist at the London School of Economics, UK, said: “The nature and shape of this recovery will determine our future. It is crucial [it] does not lock in our exposure to the great risks of climate change.” But he said it was important to distinguish between rescue packages and recovery packages and not, for example, to withhold support for the workers in high-carbon sectors. Michael Liebrich, founder of Bloomberg New Energy Finance, said the systems of the past were already failing the world before Covid-19. “As governments again load the helicopters with money to dump on the global economy … no fossil fuel-based businesses should be bailed out without committing to science-based, net-zero targets. No money should go to industries that have been living high on the hog on fossil fuel subsidies and tax loopholes, like the airline industry, unless they accept structural reform.” Ben Backwell, CEO at the Global Wind Energy Council, said some governments had extended commissioning deadlines for new wind farms, including those of India, Germany and Greece. “But so far no government has explicitly included stimulus packages specific to the wind and other renewable sectors. Much diplomatic effort went into brokering the OPEC+ deal to stabilise oil prices but the discussion needs to move on now to ensuring that renewable energy is at the centre of economic recovery plans.” The course of the recovery has yet to be decided, according to Tom Burke, chair of the E3G thinktank. “I think it is too soon to say that the battle for funds to rebuild our economy is being won by the polluting sectors of business, especially on climate change. There are some strong political forces already pushing hard to make it a recovery that is green.” Timmermans said a sustainable society was the only way to create lasting growth and jobs. Birol, who highlighted energy efficiency for buildings and battery and hydrogen technologies as important goals, also said that the current low oil prices were an opportunity to abolish $400bn a year of consumer fossil fuel subsidies, boosting government budgets. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, was clear about the need to rebuild a different global economy. “Everything we do during and after this crisis must be with a strong focus on building more equal, inclusive and sustainable economies, and societies that are more resilient in the face of pandemics, climate change, and the many other global challenges we face.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterMentioning the lethal “100-year, record-smashing” spring cold and snow spreading across Europe over the past month has for the most part been avoided like the plague by Germany’s mainstream media. The silence over the record cold and frost, which has killed thousands and cost billions, has been ear-ringing.
Yet some leading dailies are breaking ranks, and have begun to examine the phenomenon critically and openly.
For example veteran journalist Ulli Kulke at German flagship daily Die Welt today has stunned the rest of the German mainstream media with a piece titled Scientists warn of ice age.

German flagship daily reports that “scientists warning of ice age.” Logo: DIE WELT.
Kulke writes that recently a growing number of scientific publications have been appearing in leading journals, and that they have been challenging the simplistic “one dimensional CO2 explanation” for climate change and showing that even the unlikely “doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentration by 2050 would not have dramatic effects.”
Kulke writes:

Yet, papers with such content, even though they have passed the peer-review process, do not make any headlines. But they have been becoming much more frequent recently.”
Increasingly it seems more and more scientists are now seeing huge opportunity in overturning one of the most ballyhooed scientific hypotheses of modern time, funding be damned.
In the Die Welt piece, Kulke asks if the record cold and snow over much of the northern hemisphere “is just a coincidence“. The odds are increasing that it is not, and that it’s not for nothing that a growing number of scientists are becoming friendly to other explanations and that the body of evidence supporting a combination of explanations is taking shape quickly. Kulke writes that it is therefore no surprise that 2 Russian scientists have recently joined the ever more thunderous chorus of alternative explanations on what drives climate. He writes:
It’s probably no coincidence that ever louder scientific opinions warning of an imminent ice period are coming also from Russia. Vladimir Baschkin and Rauf Galiulin have recently recognized the ice age possibility in a study. Both biogeochemists – a discipline that also includes the study of the Earth’s atmosphere – have written a study for the Research Institute Vniigaz of the Gazprom concern, an address of course that cannot be said is free of lobbyists. However, their arguments are underpinned by findings that are gaining more and more acceptance from independent science: solar activity is weakening considerably – to an extent that was last seen several hundred years ago, the Little Ice Age, according to scientists.”
Kulke writes that not only is the CO2-science for explaining climate change one-dimensional, but that also only looking at changes in solar irradiance is completely inadequate. The sun’s fluctuating magnetic activity and its impact on the Earth’s atmosphere, direct and indirect, though not well understood, are proving to have a far greater influence on the Earth’s climate than many are willing to admit. This is all being backed up by leading research institutes such as CERN in Geneva and the Danish National Space Institute of Denmark.

"Recovery from coronavirus must reckon with climate change. The current and urgent focus properly needs to be flattening the curve and saving lives. Yet even as this overriding priority absorbs us, governments now need to be thinking about how to support the strongest possible recovery as we emerge from this crisis.  The prime minister, Scott Morrison, underscores we are in both a health and economic crisis. In dealing with the former we cannot lose a generation to the latter. Focus on recovery must be on maximising economic growth and jobs, and ensuring this includes everyone. This was the guiding star that steered the international response to the global financial crisis. I was advising the prime minister Kevin Rudd at that time and saw first hand just how much foresight, coordination and effort was required for success. This is much worse, and so will demand so much more. Reckoning with climate change will support a strongest possible recovery. The threat of climate change that is driving global action against it has not gone away. Indeed, the Covid-19 pandemic is a harbinger of climate disasters to come and the resilience we need to build into our systems – including health – to deal with what we know will be the adverse impacts of climate change. We know that unless we address this challenge, we will all be worse off; and the longer we take in addressing the challenge, the worse it will be. Just as Covid-19 requires us to act now to save lives in the next few weeks, climate change requires action now to avert a future global catastrophe. The logic of climate action has increasingly applied to global economic activity since the Paris agreement and must continue to underpin the investment decisions governments make going forward. Decisions that support the strongest possible recovery in growth will help to shape the future of the Australian economy. We must ensure these pathways to the future do not lock-in those that lead to damaging dead-ends: higher emissions and less climate resilience down the track to our economic, environmental and community disadvantage. Borrowing, as we are, from our kids to fund the billions in recovery stimulus, we cannot further burden them with such dead-ends. Significantly, climate related investments in many cases will offer the best prospects for economic growth and jobs. On that basis alone they should be prioritised. The OECD report Investing in Climate, Investing in Growth demonstrated this in detail for the G20 in 2018. For example, they provide options for major infrastructure investments which should be a bedrock of government stimulus for recovery: clean energy and new transport systems, more sustainable homes and buildings, improved agricultural practices water and waste management. In short, if banks will not finance new coal-fired power in Australia but will lend for renewable energy and storage, which would you tend toward, and where then are the growth and jobs, and best place for stimulus? Corporates are increasingly working this out. There were a slew of announcements over summer largely subsumed by our preoccupation with drought, bushfires and pandemic. They show business banking on climate smart investment for growth. The most significant example was BlackRock announcing a game-changing move to place sustainability at the centre of its investment approach because the returns to investors will be greater. BlackRock manages over US$7tn of assets, meaning other large asset managers will follow, as happened days after the announcement when State Street – managing US$3tn – went the same way. As corporates are now integrating climate change as core business strategy, so should governments as core economic strategy, not least for recovery. We know where such investments can be made. They are not hypothetical, whether outlined in CSIRO’s excellent technology roadmap for a low-emissions Australian economy, or Ross Garnaut’s recent excellent book on the growth opportunities Superpower: Australia’s Low Carbon Opportunity or last week’s inspiring report by Climate Works on de-carbonising Australia’s future, or presumably in the government’s forthcoming low-emissions technology roadmap for Australia. We are not short on ideas, including on climate resilience. An obvious starting point could be a nation-building stimulus investment around our decrepit energy system. By now the federal and state governments have a much stronger grasp of what we need for success, encouragingly evident on the recent $2bn federal-New South Wales government package for better access, security and affordability. Turbocharging this with a stimulus package for more renewable energy and flexible storage of all sorts (including hydrogen), accompanying transmission and security technologies for our electricity grid, and investment in dramatically improving energy efficiency would – literally and figuratively – power our economy forward. Not just for the growth and jobs in this sector alone but in the scope provided to power other sectors for growth, such as electrifying transport across the country – which stimulus could also spur. In the aftermath of our drought and bushfires, another obvious area for nation-building investment is our land sector. Farm productivity can be dramatically improved by precision agriculture and regenerative farming technologies while building resilience to drought. New sources of revenue for farmers can be created through soil carbon and forest carbon farming – with carbon trading from these activities internationally set to be worth hundreds of billions of dollars over the coming decade. These solutions and sources of growth and jobs can be harvested now with a little government support, keeping farmers on their land and regional communities thriving. In these times of despair this prospect holds out great hope. Showing it is not a dream, the EU has already said its recovery stimulus will invest in climate for growth and jobs. We should too.

"The coronavirus outbreak has provoked a string of unsettling sights, such as the sudden widespread use of masks, shuttered businesses and deserted streets. Another unusual phenomenon is also playing out in the skies – near-empty airplanes flying through the air. Widespread travel restrictions around the world have slashed demand for air travel, with more than eight in 10 flights canceled. But there is a disparity in the US – while the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has reported a 96% slump in passenger volume, to a level not seen since 1954, this hasn’t been matched by the number of flights being scrapped.  Slightly more than half the flights within the US have been canceled, leading to a slew of near-empty flights. Less than one in 10 seats on domestic flights were filled by passengers last week, according to an estimate by Dan Rutherford, aviation director at the International Council on Clean Transportation. “The evidence suggests that the number of people flying is dropping faster than the flights so there are a lot of empty planes,” he said. “The airlines are left to figure this out for themselves and they are playing catch-up.” This situation is leading to a “huge environmental waste”, Rutherford said, as planes burn huge amounts of fuel to transport just a handful of people around America. In March, Sheryl Pardo shared a video of her being upgraded to first class and given a personalized safety briefing after being the only passenger to check in to an American Airlines flight from Washington to Boston. Meanwhile, a Virgin Atlantic flight from London to New York subsequently carried just seven people. The aviation industry accounts for about 2% of global carbon emissions, although this is concentrated among the small fraction of the world’s population that regularly flies. The reduction in flights is expected to reduce pollution levels, with emissions from the sector dropping by almost a third last month, the Financial Times has reported. However, passenger numbers may well bounce back quickly following the end of the Covid-19 crisis. “You have dips around recessions but within two or three years it returns,” said Rutherford. “I imagine leisure travel will recover pretty quickly. In the boom years, airlines have eased off on attempts to improve fuel efficiency – what was going on was not sustainable. The million-dollar question is whether we will curb flying to protect the climate, as we are now doing to protect public health.” The US airline industry got $25bn in assistance in the recent stimulus package to deal with the sharp downturn in business. In return, the airlines are required to maintain a certain level of service, which may be leading to the near-empty flights. The economics of running an airline can also be counterintuitive in that it can sometimes be cheaper to fly a commercial airliner to a planned destination than pay for a spot to simply park it. According to Airlines for America, an industry group, more than a third of the US fleet, about 2,400 aircraft, have been parked, with airlines burning through cash at more than $10bn a month as cancellations “far outpace” new bookings. Planes have gone from “load factors” of 80% in January to just 11% in April. “The novel coronavirus pandemic has had, and continues to have, a severe and unprecedented impact on the US airline industry,” a spokeswoman for the lobby group said, adding that flights are also shifting important cargo such as medical supplies, food and mail. Doug Parker, chief executive of American Airlines, said: “Those that are flying today are doing so for important reasons.”  A spokesman for United said it was “still somewhat rare” for a single passenger to be on a flight and said that the company had made investments in more sustainable fuel to lower its carbon footprint. The commitment of airlines in general to addressing the climate crisis has been questioned during the coronavirus shutdown, however. Airlines are lobbying to rewrite the rules of a global agreement designed to tackle aviation emissions, with the coronavirus outbreak expected to make its targets tougher to meet. Campaigners accused airlines of attempting to “dodge their obligations”, but the industry said it was “a matter of survival”. • This article was amended on 20 April 2020 to replace the main image with one that was more relevant to the focus of the article."

A left-coast writer named Mark Morford thinks that gas prices falling to $2 a gallon would be the worst thing to happen to America. After all, he says, the _wrong_ people would profit: oil companies (why would oil companies profit from lower gas prices?), auto makers, and internet retailers like Amazon that offer free shipping.   
  
If falling gas prices are the worst for America, then the best, Morford goes on to say, would be to raise gas taxes by $6 a gallon and dedicate all of the revenue to boondoggles ""alternative energy and transport, environmental protections, our busted educational system, our multi-trillion debt."" After all, government has proven itself so capable of finding the most cost-effective solutions to any problem in the past, and there's no better way to reduce the debt than to tax the economy to death.   
  
Morford is right in line with progressives like Naomi Klein, who thinks climate change is a grand opportunity to make war on capitalism. Despite doubts cast by other leftists, Klein insists that ""responding to climate change could be the catalyst for a positive social and economic transformation""--by which she means government control of transportation, housing, and just about everything else.   
  
These advocates of central planning remind me of University of Washington international studies professor Daniel Chirot assessment of the fall of the Soviet empire. From the time of Lenin, noted Chirot, soviet planners considered western industrial systems of the late nineteenth century their model for an ideal economy. By the 1980s, after decades of hard work, they had developed ""the most advanced industries of the late 19th and early 20th centuries--polluting, wasteful, energy intensive, massive, inflexible--in short, giant rust belts.""   
  
Morford and Klein want to do the same to the United States, using climate change as their excuse, and the golden age they wish to return to is around 1920, when streetcars and intercity passenger trains were at their peak (not counting the WWII era). Sure, there were cars, but only a few compared with today.   




What they don't understand is that, even at their peak, intercity passenger trains carried the average American only about 900 miles a year, while streetcars and other urban transit carried the average American about 700 miles a year. Moreover, nearly all of this travel was by the top 25 or 30 percent: until that evil capitalist Henry Ford made his mass produced automobile available at affordable prices, the working class people that progressives claim to care about were no more mobile than Americans had been a hundred years before.   
  
Thanks to profiteering automakers and greedy oil companies, the average American today travels by car nearly 15,000 miles a year, close to 10 times the total per capita urban and intercity rail travel of 1920. Morford and Klein, of course, think less travel would be a good thing, since it would result (says Morford) in ""people shopping more locally and patronizing small businesses again."" Yet there's no guarantee of that. Higher gas prices could also lead to people shopping on Amazon or seeking out WalMart's ""always"" low prices even more than they do today.   
  
Are Morford, Klein, and their allies ignorant of the facts, economically naive, or do they just object to the choices other people make? It always seems like demagoguery to say that opponents are afraid of freedom, but it's a natural conclusion for progressives like Morford and Klein.   
  
When they say, ""shop locally,"" what they mean is, ""pay more for inferior goods."" When they say, ""don't reward the oil companies,"" what they mean is, ""most people shouldn't be allowed to travel as much as they like."" When they say, ""capitalism is bad,"" what they mean is, ""you shouldn't allowed to buy things that other people make because they might earn a profit from it."" When they say, ""a planet of suburbs is a terrible idea,"" what they mean is, ""everyone should live like I do.""   
  
In reality, low gas prices mean increased mobility which in turn should promote the economic recovery that has been stalled for six years by Obama's central planning. Cars are getting more fuel efficient no matter what oil and gas prices are, and even if that is partly because of government fiat, it is also a lot more cost-effective than trying to change everyone's lifestyles.   
  
Freedom means allowing people to make choices you wouldn't make for yourself. Moreover, it means allowing people to make choices you may not agree with for anyone because in a democracy we agree that no one person has all the answers for everyone else. Ultimately, freedom means understanding that the alternative, no matter how good it sounds on paper, always leads to tyranny and oppression.   
  
If you really care about certain values, and some technologies seem to run counter to those values, then you need to figure out ways to make your values more attractive, not try to tax or regulate those technologies to death. If the price of freedom is a slightly warmer world--and I'm not convinced that it is--then we are better off learning to live with it than having to live under the yoke of well-intentioned but ignorant planners who don't understand such basic concepts as cost effectiveness or supply and demand.

"BlackRock, one of the world’s largest investors in banks and fossil fuel companies, has been hired by the EU to work on potential new environmental rules for banks. Campaigners raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest, given BlackRock’s widespread financial interests in sectors that could be directly impacted by new environmental rules.  The European commission, the EU’s executive arm, said this week that BlackRock had beaten eight other bidders on a contract to study how the EU could best integrate environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into its banking supervision. BlackRock is the world’s largest investment manager, with $7.43tn (£5.97tn) in assets under management on 31 December, before the coronavirus pandemic caused a global market rout. The majority of those assets are in products that track equity and bond indices, meaning the company by default controls large stakes in many of the world’s biggest companies. Analysis by InfluenceMap for the Guardian found that BlackRock in October controlled shares in fossil fuel companies worth $87.3bn that held 3.27bn barrels of fossil fuel reserves. BlackRock is a top-three investor in all eight of the world’s largest oil companies, and a top-10 investor in the 12 most systemically important banks in the world. Katrin Ganswindt, a climate and energy campaigner at Urgewald, a non-profit environmental and human rights organisation, said: “Appointing BlackRock as advisor to the European commission on environmental, social and governance factors seems a bit like letting the fox guard the henhouse. On top of being the world’s largest investor in fossil fuels, they are also among the leading global financiers of the weapons industry. “We are baffled as to why the European commission didn’t think there would be a massive conflict of interest with this choice.” The commission will pay BlackRock’s Financial Markets Advisory (FMA) arm €280,000 (£244,000) for the study, according to a contract award notice published on the commission’s website – equating to only 1.3% of the $24m pay given to the BlackRock chief executive, Larry Fink, in 2018, or 0.007% of the company’s $4.5bn operating profits in 2019. However, decisions made by European banking regulators on ESG issues could have significant financial effects on the companies whose shares BlackRock holds. For instance, looser restrictions on bank lending to companies fuelling the climate crisis could profit both oil companies and lenders. BlackRock itself has been strongly criticised for blocking progress on environmental issues. Guardian analysis of data from ProxyInsight found that BlackRock opposed or abstained on 82% of climate-related shareholder resolutions at the companies whose shares it managed between 2015 and 2019, far lower than many rivals. However, in 2020 the company has taken significant steps to make environmental sustainability a core part of its business. In January it said it would divest from companies that made 25% or more of their revenues from coal, as well as pledging to start using its voting power to force companies to disclose climate risks. A European commission spokesman said contract was awarded “in full and strict compliance with the applicable EU procurement rules, including those on the eligibility of tenderers and the prevention of any potential conflict of interest”. BlackRock’s tender was better than competitors, and it will form only one input in the EU’s policymaking, the spokesman added. A spokesman for BlackRock said its FMA arm functioned separately to the investment management unit. He said: “We are honoured that BlackRock Financial Markets Advisory has been selected to perform an analysis to inform the European commission’s action plan on sustainable finance, deploying our expertise and capabilities in advising public-sector clients on structural trends, including the transition to a low-carbon future.” • This article was amended on 17 April 2020 because an earlier version incorrectly referred to the European commission’s suggested fee of €550,000. In fact, the fee paid to BlackRock will be €280,000."

The United Nations has outlived any usefulness it ever promised but could not deliver. It is now chock full of delegates who are anti-USA and anti-Israel who want to pillage the economic resources of the west through migration and climate change funding. 



1\. **Through migration.**



[ _Whaleoil_](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/07/thursday-nightcap-332/) posted a video interview by Mark Steyn with previous American presidential candidate Michele Bachmann about the American experience. Bachman **estimates 25% of the GDP of some Latin and South American countries comes from the United States**.



The United Nations use illegal migration as a tool to fulfil their agenda to redistribute western wealth. The notion of **using migrants to pillage western welfare** was a new concept to me.



 **The United Nations believes migration is beneficial** and are moving forward with legislation to promote legal migration, but Bachman talks about the economic benefits **illegal migrants also receive** from the United States.



“They [the UN] encourage people to come into the west – into the United States – because they know there will be immediate access to the welfare states.“



“Damn what our laws say. There will be immediate access to the welfare state and I’ve asked the presidents of Latin American countries, South American countries – what percentage of your GDP is from, ah remittances – money that is earned in the United States and sent back home.”



“And **for many of them a fourth of the entire GDP comes from remittances from the United States**. So, whether that’s from earnings – **legal or illegal** – or whether that’s from **welfare state remittances** , it’s coming from the US and it’s streaming out of our country.”



Steyn argues the money would be better directed into improving third world economies to remove the incentive of illegal migration to the US and points out that **non-Americans can easily remit funds overseas,** whereas Americans sending funds overseas would be “subject to IRS scrutiny for the next 20 years, but **apparently if you are non-American you can take money and send it anywhere** on the planet”.



In theory, disincentivising migration by improving third world countries sounds attractive. But in practice, passing funds through the hands of the corrupt governments responsible for economic failure in the first place is a huge, almost insurmountable hurdle.



Bachmann resides in Minnesota, home to the largest population of Somalis outside Somalia and home of the Somali state-funded childcare scandal that broke in 2018.



“So, a number of Somalis have set up day cares, whether it’s in their homes in businesses outside of their home, to such an extent that the ah, the number that’s being reported were that a hundred million dollars in a year’s time has transited through the Minneapolis St Paul airport, in cash, in roller bags, going to Somalia.



So, a hundred million in cash coming out of these day cares and so… because **Minnesota is the most generous welfare state of all 50 states.** There is nothing too good for… for the welfare recipients in Minnesota, by the tax payers of Minnesota.



We’ve made it so easy, in fact, that we have apps for smart phones for people who utilise this system, and so **a day care provider can sit and just ping this system for non-existent children in the day care – and that’s being done**. In fact there’s a story that one woman had left the United States with her roller bag filled with cash on her way to Somalia and she was sitting in an $800 a night hotel room in Nairobi pinging on the app, the Minnesota app, for more fake kids in her day care and we’re paying all this money.”



Bachmann alleges the funds were used for terrorist activity but Minnesota’s legislative auditor released a report this year that **confirmed “widespread child care assistance fraud** ” but failed to confirm a connection between the state’s Child Care Assistance Programme and al Shabab or other terrorists. This does not mean the connection does not exist, it just means the review could not find it. But the scam was expensive.



“Jay Swanson, the manager of the CCAP investigators, said he believed [**$100 million was roughly accurate**](https://www.minnpost.com/state-government/2019/03/what-we-learned-from-the-audit-of-minnesotas-child-care-assistance-program-no-suitcases-full-of-cash-but-plenty-of-baggage/). But he also had an expansive view of fraud that goes beyond what is typically prosecuted in criminal proceedings. His attention focused on roughly 100 child care centers and he assumed lax supervision by employees was fraud, as well as overbilling. “Therefore, in Swanson’s opinion, all of the CCAP money paid to those centers in 2017 — approximately $108 million — should be counted as fraud,” the report says.”



2\. **Through Climate Change Funding**



“One has to free oneself from the illusion that international climate policy is environmental policy. This has almost nothing to do with the environmental policy anymore, with problems such as deforestation or the ozone hole,” said Edenhofer, who co-chaired the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change working group on Mitigation of Climate Change from 2008 to 2015.



So, what is the goal of environmental policy?



 **“We redistribute de facto the world’s wealth by climate policy,”** said Edenhofer.



Helen Clark paved the way for successive NZ governments, including our sycophantic UN loving CoL.



[Nominations close this 28 July](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/deadline-approaching-climate-change-commission-nominations) for our very own “independent” Climate Change Commissioner who will ensure the UN agenda is closely adhered to.

"These questions were put to the candidates before the coronavirus crisis 1. Is the climate crisis the biggest issue the UK faces as a nation and will you commit to making it Labour’s priority for the duration of this parliament?  Rebecca Long-Bailey The climate crisis is the greatest challenge we face as a nation and as a globe, not just for this parliament but in the decades and century to come. The inactions of previous governments have escalated the urgency of the challenge we face; and it is a challenge we can only meet by addressing the crisis in our living standards and the crisis of faith in our democracy. As leader I will continue the work I’ve been doing with trade unions, Labour activists and technical experts to develop a plan on how we do this, for example, developing our policies such as insulating 27m homes, using public ownership to transition to a green, affordable energy system, creating an industrial strategy to deliver high-quality, unionised jobs across the country and developing a detailed, properly funded plan to make sure no one loses out from this transition. As a Labour party we need to work with communities about what policies they want to see that would transform their lives and meet the climate crisis. We need to continue to harness the energy and enthusiasm of campaigners and young climate strikers who have helped push the climate crisis to the top of the political agenda through their actions, and work with them to show the world we are opposed to Trump’s climate crisis denial when our country hosts Cop26 this year. Lisa Nandy Yes. As prime minister I would make reaching climate safety the top priority for the whole of my government. I know it is not beyond us not only to build a zero-carbon economy but also to lead the global effort required to reach climate safety. I know that solving the climate crisis means integrating the solutions into every part of what the government does and that means hard-wiring the answers into the very foundations of our country’s economic and foreign policies. One of the first things I did on becoming Labour’s shadow energy secretary back in 2015 was to read Elizabeth Kolbert’s book, Field Notes From A Catastrophe. It brought home to me the scale of the risks from the climate emergency. Climate breakdown isn’t just a far-off threat to other people in other places in some distant future. You can already see the impact that even the warming to date is having in terms of the horrific fires raging across Australia and California, the shifting rain patterns damaging livelihoods for millions of people across Asia and Africa, and the unprecedented flooding we’ve seen here in Britain in recent years. We don’t have the luxury of time so yes it would be a top priority for me during this parliament too. The European Green Deal is the EU’s answer to what the European commission’s new president, Ursula von der Leyen, called the “existential issue” of the climate emergency. Most EU countries have signed up to goal of a climate neutral EU by 2050, a goal demanding dramatic change in energy use, farming, housing, transport, trade and diplomacy. The European Green Deal is only the start of the journey: laws will have to be drafted and agreed by EU ministers and MEPs; money will have to be raised; plans will have to be implemented. It is a route map, rather than a destination, and time is running out. Kier Starmer Yes – and for the next parliament when we are in government. We all have a common interest in rapid decarbonisation, so it needs to be a guiding thread across all policy areas: from foreign policy to local government, from transport to housing. 2. As Labour leader, how will you tackle the climate crisis between now and the next general election [ie what can be done while you are in opposition?]. Can you give three specific examples? RLB As leader I will continue my record of forcing the Tories to U-turn and back down on some of their most destructive policies, such as their support for fracking. It was Labour that meant parliament declared a climate and environmental emergency, work that I led. In parliament we need to keep piling the political pressure on the Tories, for example, using our presence there to bring an end to the ban on onshore wind in England and fighting any attempt to water down our environmental commitments in any trade deals we strike, particularly with the US. At the Cop26 later this year as Labour leader I will be stood shoulder to shoulder with campaigners and activists fighting for a landmark series of commitments and agreements. The eyes of the world will be on us when Trump, the climate breakdown denier, arrives and our prime minister gives him a warm welcome. Moves to curb the civil liberties of, or label peaceful activists as extremists, must be resisted. As Labour leader I also want to give prominence to what Labour can do in power. Many Labour local councils and mayors are declaring climate emergencies and developing their own Green New Deals with their local communities. The Labour councillors and community activists taking this lead are examples of how we can reach into local communities, organise and campaign – lessons we need to learn ahead of the next general election. Labour's 'green new deal' - or 'green industrial revolution' - proposes a massive programme of state investment to rapidly decarbonise the economy, creating hundreds of thousands of green jobs, and transforming the way people live - from upgrading the housing stock to revitalising public transport, tackling the UK’s air pollution crisis to moving towards a more sustainable agricultural model. Although the initial investment would be huge, advocates say that would be dwarfed by the cost of not tackling the escalating climate crisis and point to wide-ranging economic benefits in the medium term, positioning the UK at the forefront of the emerging green industries, which are expected to dominate in the coming years. Crucially, the green new deal would tie radical environmental action to a worker-led “just transition”, where the rapid move from a carbon-based economy to a sustainable system is led by – and benefits – ordinary people. Its advocates say jobs in carbon-intensive industries would be replaced by – among others – those in wind, solar, house building and transport infrastructure. Labour's manifesto put the green new deal at the centre of its 2019 election campaign. The idea has also been championed by leading Democratic presidential candidates in the US 2020 race. Internationally, its supporters say any such proposal must also recognise the west’s historic responsibility for the crisis - and its global nature - and support a just transition in the developing world through transfers of technology and finance, while welcoming migrants. Matthew Taylor LN As shadow energy and climate secretary, before the Paris summit, I initiated a collaboration between more than 60 Labour councils across Britain to cut the UK’s carbon footprint by 10% through action in the places where Labour is in power. Before the next election there is the opportunity to build on this with more on-the-ground activism to deliver on the Paris agreement through everything from solar energy coops to community tree-planting schemes and investment in bus services. By showcasing the solutions in our communities, and seizing on the opportunity for good new jobs in every town, Labour can help build out the climate movement into the more broad-based, society-wide force that we need it to be. Only through a movement will we stop a reckless Trump trade deal, which would threaten decades of hard-won rights and protections, and pave our way back to No 10 Downing Street. KS The climate crisis cannot wait until 2024. So, I will work with Labour administrations wherever they are in power – from councils, city mayors to devolved governments – as they involve communities, trade unions and businesses, to design their own pathways to zero net carbon by 2030. We need to encourage bottom-up solutions through supporting climate assemblies and green cooperatives. We must also be an effective opposition in parliament, holding the government to account on the basis of the pace of decarbonisation our planet needs – not the unambitious targets they have set themselves. 3. Will Labour under your leadership commit to: • Retrofitting all UK homes [27m] and buildings by 2030 and fight to ensure all new buildings are zero carbon by the end of this parliament? • Producing 90% of the UK’s electricity from renewable sources [through 7,000 offshore, 2,000 onshore turbines and 3x expansion of solar] by 2030? • Producing 50% renewable heating through 8m heat pumps and investment in hydrogen? RLB Yes, I commissioned the expert report, Thirty by 2030 (pdf), these recommendations are based on. It gives us a real plan to not only hold the government to account on what they are failing to do – but also helps turn what can be abstract targets to most people into real, everyday changes for the better. Insulating homes will end fuel poverty. An active industrial strategy will make sure that Britain is the producer of the wind turbines and other technologies we need for the future, creating good jobs and apprenticeships in our towns, cities and regions. The opportunities for large-scale renewal are endless – we just need to be ambitious and creative. It is a central part of how I believe Labour can sell our aspirational socialism to people across the country. LN I know we need a wholesale transformation in the way we power and heat our homes and businesses but that this is possible and necessary and offers huge economic opportunities. As a windswept nation we can be the Saudi Arabia of clean energy, but all too often we are losing out on the jobs and factories to other countries with a different approach to industrial strategy and that has to change. KS I fully support Labour’s Green New Deal and the proposals for a Green Transformation Fund (pdf) and a National Investment Bank (pdf). The proposals offer a pathway to a greener economy married to social justice, which our country badly needs. It should be hardwired into everything we do as a country and as a party. 4. If yes, how should this work be financed and organised? RLB These are huge challenges and it requires bold and ambitious thinking. We already have deepening wealth inequality in this country and a crisis in living standards. The Conservative approach has been to load costs on to households that are already struggling, while letting energy companies profiteer. We can’t have this approach if we are going to turn this into an opportunity to deliver better lives and a better Britain. It’s why the proposal I set out at the 2019 election had public ownership and public investment in our energy system as a central plank, so we can be strategic and make sure that extra costs are not loaded on to homes that can’t afford it. For example, when it comes to insulating homes, it makes sense for the government to pay for the work upfront, and for the costs to be repaid by households who can afford it over time through savings on their energy bills. Lower-income households should not have to repay the cost of the works, so they can benefit from all the bill savings immediately. Delivering such a large programme in partnership with local communities, with local councils and public bodies playing a central role, can guarantee the quality of work to people’s homes and the quality of jobs we create. When it comes to developing the renewable energy sector and where the public is helping to provide the investment, the public should also get a long-term stake in what are profitable enterprises. The UK, as the world’s largest offshore wind market, should have a far greater role in manufacturing the technology, creating good, skilled jobs here, rather than relying on imports, as is currently the case. We should use our public stake to make sure these projects benefit communities, with local procurement boosting local supply chains. LN I would like to see a bigger role for people in every part of the country to influence and shape the transition so I’m fascinated to see what ideas will emerge from the first national citizens assembly on climate change. What’s clear is that the transition to date has not been funded fairly because low-income households have paid a disproportionately high contribution and the debate so far has been too technocratic and too driven from Brussels and Westminster. For the transition to work the solutions in the next phase must have broad support and benefit communities across the country and that’s more likely to happen if everyone can get involved. KS (see previous answer)  5. How will you ensure the poorest people in the UK and around the world are not made to pay disproportionately for the climate crisis? RLB For too long in this country, too many of our communities have been ignored and seen the erosion of their local public services. We cannot tackle the climate crisis by loading the costs on to the shoulders of those just making ends meet. As leader I will continue to pursue progressive mechanisms, such as public ownership and strategic public investment in the infrastructure we need for the future, in a way that delivers our broader goals of aspirational socialism. For example, expanding our bus networks and creating a public transport system that is integrated, accessible and affordable will improve our air quality and cut emissions, while improving regional connectivity, making life more convenient for millions. Internationally, we need to make sure the UK is a world leader not a world lagger – as the first in the world to industrialise and one of the wealthiest, we need to reduce our emissions at a rate that takes our fair share of the global responsibility to avoid more than 1.5 degrees of warming, as well as ensuring we are doing it in a way that is just and equitable at home. Social justice and aspiration go hand in hand with global justice. When Trump comes to this country for Cop26 Labour needs to join the voices from around the globe calling for urgent action. The poorest parts of the globe are already experiencing the worst impacts of climate breakdown, which they are least responsible for creating. That is why I support increasing the amount of international public climate finance the UK provides for mitigation and adaptation, and channelling these funds through the UN’s green climate fund, and away from the World Bank. Rather than welcome Trump to our country, we should be leading international efforts to establish a new fund to compensate countries in the global south for loss and damage suffered due to climate impacts. We can ensure the technologies developed in the UK and create jobs here through our green industrial revolution are also made available at reduced cost in the global south. LN It’s a tragedy and an injustice that it is the poorest and most vulnerable people in the world who are most exposed to the impacts of the climate crisis around the world. Their voice must be heard as we debate the solutions to the crisis, not just because it’s the right thing to do but also because it will help unlock the answers to a just transition. It was Europe’s approach of working together with the small island states of the South Pacific and the vulnerable countries in sub-Saharan Africa, which built the global alliances that unlocked the Paris agreement. Britain’s leadership in international development helped to build these special relationships and shows why social justice and environmental justice go hand in hand. We should never see offsets as a cheap alternative to reducing pollution here at home and we must pay for the investments needed by ensuring the wealthiest who did most to cause the problem invest the most in fixing it, and by exploring the role that well-designed pollution taxes could play to ensure the fossil fuel industry helps clean up the mess it caused. KS The Green New Deal needs to be married to social justice both domestically and internationally. Domestically we need a just transition which provides good unionised green jobs, addresses regional inequalities and does not leave workers behind. The UK has profited from burning fossil fuels in the past, so we must assist developing countries in their leap forward, skipping our bad habits, building renewables rather than coal power stations. We should use our development budget – and work for greater international financial assistance – to help developing countries grow their own low-carbon economies. 6. Do you support more new nuclear power stations after Hinkley C is completed and, if so, how will they be funded? RLB I support new nuclear power where it is needed for the UK’s future energy security. We need to find the right funding model that will guarantee value for money for the taxpayer and ensure any public stake is used in a way that benefits local communities. Lisa Nandy I’m not writing my manifesto for the next general election just yet but I have argued consistently and for many years that now – right in the middle of a climate emergency – is not the time we should rule out a role for nuclear power or any other low-emission technology. The biggest challenges for the nuclear industry are the high costs associated with new nuclear stations, and their lack of a long-term sustainable solution to deal with the harmful waste they produce, but we will have to weigh these problems against the contribution nuclear power can make to meeting our energy demands in a way that creates good jobs and is consistent with building a zero-carbon economy and it is most important that we are guided by the science and the evidence on this. KS I support the Labour position that nuclear power is part of the mix of moving away from fossil fuels. But our overwhelming focus must be on increasing the energy share of renewables including solar, wind and tidal energy, and with decentralised energy. 7. Do you support HS2? RLB Yes. The government’s mismanagement of the cost and delivery date is a national scandal, and much more needs to be done to manage the local environmental impacts. However, HS2 is needed to increase the UK’s rail capacity, reducing reliance on our roads for passengers and freeing up capacity for more freight travel. This should be part of a more ambitious programme for public transport. For example, we should be building high-speed rail down from Scotland, projects like Crossrail for the north, connections between our towns and reopening branch closures. LN The government has completely mishandled the HS2 project. They have let costs spiral and failed to make the argument for the merits of the scheme. HS2 should never be allowed to justify any failure to invest in the bus networks and other clean public transport projects, which should be a higher priority than this single railway, but it should be possible to both improve the capacity of the existing rail and bus network and expand it too so yes, it should go ahead. KS If we are serious about the climate emergency, we must invest in green public transport. For that to work effectively there has to be a national plan for an integrated public transport network, and HS2 should have been a part of that. I voted against HS2 because of the social and environmental impact it will have on Euston in my constituency. But the project is now inevitably going ahead, and my focus is compensation and mitigation locally. I recognise the need for connectivity in the north and Midlands but the project should have started there, not from London. HS2 should not proceed at the expense of other really important rail upgrades like Crossrail for the north. 8. Do you support or oppose the third runway at Heathrow and/or all airport expansion? RLB Labour was clear in our manifesto that any expansion of airports must pass our tests on air quality, noise pollution, climate change obligations and countrywide benefits, including the current proposals for Heathrow expansion. We need to be rigorous in upholding these tests; as leading scientists have again pointed out the proposals do not meet Labour’s tests, particularly on climate change and as such I do not support them. LN I voted against a third runway at Heathrow because of the extraordinary environmental damage it would clearly cause, not just to our climate but to Londoners’ air quality too. I was a councillor in west London and the experiences I witnessed of people suffering from asthma was already shocking many years ago, and it absolutely can’t be allowed to get so much worse because of a failure of imagination in fixing our transport system. On airport expansion elsewhere in the country, we must be guided by the expert advice of the Committee on Climate Change in terms of what level of aviation growth could be consistent with our climate change laws and international commitments. KS I voted against Heathrow expansion because of the impact on climate change. We need to be serious about the climate emergency and our commitments under the Paris agreement. I personally don’t think that’s consistent with approving airport expansion but, of course, I’ll look at any proposals and measure them against climate tests. 9. Do you back financial support specifically for rewilding projects and commit to Labour’s existing policy to create 10 new national nature parks; rewild the 10 existing national parks and create “natural corridors” in the form of local parks, walking pathways, cycling lanes and canals? RLB Yes. These are examples of actions we need to take to tackle the climate crisis, but will also make our cities, towns and local communities nicer and healthier places to live, bringing public luxury to the spaces and services we care about. LN Tackling the climate emergency needs to go hand-in-hand with restoring our natural environment. Our country is one of the least wooded in the whole of Europe, and yet we know that trees lock up carbon, provide vital habitat for wildlife, and improve air quality in towns and cities. I also believe that every child deserves to have access to trees and green spaces as they grow up, wherever they live and whatever their parents’ income. So I would absolutely create 10 new national nature parks and back natural corridors. I would also enable more people to take control of the management of their local parks, and ensure that local government had the powers and funding to maintain them. Rewilding is something I think we need to explore with local communities in the places where schemes like this might go forward. I am convinced we can find the right mixture of natural regeneration, new tree-planting and support for sustainable farming in this country, but to do so we first need to see off the risks of a Trump trade deal that would sacrifice environmental, food safety and animal welfare standards and throw many UK farmers on the scrapheap. KS Rewilding is an essential part of the fightback against the climate and environmental emergency. I support ambitious tree-planting schemes and new nature parks to halt the devastating loss of biodiversity and to help in the fight against air pollution which plagues our streets. Our children are breathing toxic air in 71% of UK towns and cities - this is a national scandal and more green spaces must be part of the solution. 10. Do you support a post-Brexit agricultural subsidy regime to support environmental schemes such as tree planting, soil and peat restoration and flood protection? Should that funding be at least £1bn a year, ie a third of the current EU CAP scheme? RLB I support maintaining the current level of funding support to British farming and farmland management. However, I will pursue a “public money for public goods” approach, and would want to see agricultural subsidies conditioned on sustainable land use practices like tree planting, soil and peat restoration, flood protection and biodiversity promotion. Under my leadership, Labour would invest in forestation and landscape restoration, for example, our commitment to invest £3.7bn over a decade in tree planting, but this funding would be additional to payments in the agricultural subsidy regime. LN It’s bonkers that millionaires on the rich list are still raking in vast subsidies of taxpayers’ cash from farm subsidies. Investing public money should always be about securing public goods, not offering backdoor handouts to wealthy Tory donors. Our farmers will need to play a crucial role in restoring nature, storing carbon to cut emissions, and growing healthy and sustainable food, and these are public goods our subsidy regime should be helping us to meet. With Boris Johnson pursuing such a hard Brexit, there is a real risk that these goals could be undermined in the pursuit of a low-standards, reckless trade deal with Trump and we must fight that every step of the way. KS Trees, soil, and peat are natural carbon sinks so restoring and replanting them will be key to our aims of net zero carbon emissions. As the recent floods across much of England and Wales demonstrate, the UK’s flood protections are already insufficient, and the worsening climate crisis promises even more violent weather and rising sea levels. Significant investment in flood defences is therefore a priority to mitigate the worse effects of climate change. 11. Do you support the implementation of policies to reduce red meat consumption in the UK? If so what form might that take? RLB Growing numbers of people are cutting down on red meat, or becoming vegetarian and vegan, as people think about the environment and their health. It’s been really positive how we’ve seen businesses respond to that growing demand in producing substitutes for old favourites like the sausage roll. Too often the green movement has been painted as telling people what they can and can’t do. We need to find a different way of having discussions as a country on these issues while not losing focus on the most urgent questions facing us. Fighting climate change is about key players across the world coming together to collectively address the challenge we face, and working out in this country how we can restructure our economy so that it is both sustainable and able to support a high quality of life for everyone. LN The priority for governments must be to focus on the biggest driver of emissions, which is the global fossil fuel industry; but the Committee on Climate Change has made it clear that we also need to think about how we manage our land and produce our food. In my view this is not about telling people what to eat – it’s about tackling food waste, working with farmers to reduce pollution from things like artificial fertilisers and pesticides, and protecting high-quality food production in the UK from the impacts of reckless trade deals. I also think we have to have a much stronger focus on food poverty. Children going to school hungry in one of the richest countries in the world is both heart-breaking and shameful. KS After fossil fuels, the food industry – particularly the meat and dairy sector – is one of the most significant contributors to climate change and, in many countries, to deforestation. All of us should therefore think about how we might reduce our consumption of red meat. But changes in behaviour, important as they are, should not distract us from the systemic nature of the problem of climate change. That’s why I support Labour’s plans for a radical Green New Deal to combat the climate and environmental emergency. 12. Do you support a frequent flyer tax to reduce air travel? RLB At the moment the vast majority of the population fly once a year or less – they shouldn’t be unfairly taxed. We don’t want to penalise or make it harder for people to go on holiday. But it is right to consider how we ask wealthy frequent flyers to shoulder more responsibility, or reduce the frequency of their flights. In government as Labour leader I would ensure we review aviation taxation and consider and consult on the development and implementation of proposals recommended by the Committee on Climate Change. LN It cannot be right that when 70% of flights are taken by just 15% of the public, the wealthiest people who are polluting the most do not pay a level of tax to reflect this and instead pay the same as the family taking their hard-earned rest once a year, so yes as prime minister I would look to make the system fairer and greener. KS Air travel is a particularly fossil fuel-intensive form of travel so, especially while we do not have the technology for green flights, we should encourage people to use alternative forms of transport where possible. We need to make sure that our tax system encourages that. 13. Will you commit to greater funding for public transport, cycling and walking than for road building? RLB Yes. We need greater funding for and an expansion of public transport, cycling and walking for all sorts of reasons – not just in tackling the climate crisis, but to improve our economy, the connections between cities and towns, and rural areas, making our public transport more accessible and to encourage healthier lives and cleaner air. LN It is absolutely scandalous that when 60% of journeys are by bus, literally thousands of local bus routes have been cut since the Tories came back to power, hundreds just in the last year, and fares have been allowed to rocket too. I would invest properly in public transport – and yes nationalise the railways, but also give councils the power to run bus routes for people not profit so they can set the fares and the routes and ensure all the buses in the fleet are zero carbon by 2025. I know that where Labour is in power, our mayors and councils are paving the way on cycling and as a result the number of cyclists is going up, so I would work with them to ensure communities get the investment they need to build on these successes. KS The government has made a political choice to spend transport budgets on roads rather than greener and cheaper forms of transport. I would lead a Labour government with different priorities: building a more sustainable, affordable, accessible and integrated transport system – with investment in bus services, renationalisation of our railways, and support for cycling and pedestrians. 14. Do you back clean air zones that charge or ban polluting vehicles in urban areas, which government research shows are the most effective policy to reduce air pollution? RLB Yes, I support a new Clean Air Act enshrining the World Health Organization’s advisory air quality standards into domestic law. This would include clean air zones around schools. I was proud to announce Labour’s electric car revolution at Labour conference last year, setting out how an industrial strategy can support the sector to transition to manufacturing electric vehicles and batteries, and proposing creative measures such as electric community car clubs. So alongside an expansion in public transport we are also ensuring that we are transitioning over to zero emission vehicles, and that transition supports jobs and industries here in Britain. LN It is truly shocking that one in 19 deaths in our largest cities and towns are linked to air pollution when we can and should do much more to prevent this. In London, Oxford, Reading and most of the south-east, levels are above the limits recognised as safe by the World Health Organization and on some days many kids can’t even play outside in their school playgrounds without a high risk of suffering an asthma attack caused by the toxic state of the air. Labour in local government is leading the way on tackling this through schemes like [London mayor Sadiq Khan’s] Ulez [ultra-low emission zone] and [Bristol mayor Marvin Rees’s] diesel ban in Bristol. We need the new clean air legislation expected this year to ensure our air is healthy to breathe, in line with WHO advice, and to bolster the strong local government action Labour is leading. KS Air pollution already contributes to over 40,000 premature deaths a year in the UK, and is particularly damaging to the health of our children, who are breathing unsafe levels of air pollution in 71% of our towns and cities. That’s why I’ve called for an immediate Clean Air Act to tackle air pollution by creating clean air zones. 15. The Committee on Climate Change says the UK is unprepared for the impacts of climate change. Will you increase funding for adaptation and what policies do you support to prepare for the inevitable increases in flooding, heatwaves and summer water shortages? RLB Yes. I stand by Labour’s 2019 commitment to invest an additional £5.6bn to level up flood defences over 10 years, paid for through public capital investment. The new fund will prioritise areas of need, particularly in regions such as the north-west, Yorkshire and the east Midlands that have been neglected under the Tories. Climate change will place huge pressures on our freshwater resources. But the UK’s privatised water companies have done a terrible job managing that resource, with only 14% of rivers safe for swimming, record fines issued for sewage leaks, and 20-25% of our water wasted before it even reaches our taps. That is why managing our water security in a warming climate will require publicly owned, democratically accountable water companies. Better insulated homes, delivered through Labour’s mass retrofitting programme, will be better adapted to extreme summer heat as well as keeping us warm in winter. LN Short-term Tory cuts to flood budgets left scars on communities across the country and are one of the worst impacts of their damaging austerity programme. We’re lucky to have some of the foremost experts in the entire world in the Met Office, the Committee on Climate Change, and in many of our universities, to advise us on what we should do to prepare for climate change and so we should heed their advice about what dangerous impacts we must prepare for to ensure we are limiting the damage from worsening extreme weather wherever we can and that means properly investing in flood defences. KS As demonstrated by the recent flooding of much of England and Wales and the fact that the last five years have been the hottest five years on record, the effects of climate breakdown have already begun. Mitigating those effects will be essential and funding needs to match our new needs – but it should not distract from our absolute commitment to prevention through urgent emission reductions and a Green New Deal. 16. What direct diplomacy should Labour undertake with international partners to help make Cop26 a success? RLB The eyes of the world will be on us at Cop26; we need to show them we reject those who deny the climate crisis or continue to fail to act on its urgency. World leaders have to heed the warnings of young climate activists whose future is at stake; the world is increasingly in flames as we have seen in the Amazon, California, Australia and in Scotland last spring. As Labour leader I will work directly with our sister parties in Europe and across the world, both in power and in opposition, to help make sure an ambitious set of demands and commitments are agreed at Cop26. LN I was proud to lead Labour’s international delegation to the historic Paris summit and to meet the civil society leaders and diplomats who worked so tirelessly to secure that deal. So I know how precious and hard-won it was and is and why it is essential we now defend it and see it implemented in full. Across the world it is gutsy, young women like the prime ministers of Finland and New Zealand, who are carrying the hopes and dreams of Greta and the youth movement into the global diplomatic arena and making strides forward and if I am prime minister I promise to join them. Ahead of the Cop26 summit in Scotland later this year, there is an opportunity for Labour to build on the initiative I kick-started five years ago to showcase climate solutions where we are in power in local government, city halls and the Welsh assembly and to share the learning from these experiences internationally, as I know Sadiq has been doing with London’s experiences through the C40 network of cities who helped secure the Paris agreement. KS We know that climate change is an unavoidably international problem. So we must match our efforts for a Green New Deal at home with our efforts abroad. The UK should use our Cop26 presidency to build and lead an international net-zero coalition. On 8 March 2020, I’m meeting with activists and experts in Birmingham to begin co-designing the demands that we think the Labour party should make of our government and of governments around the world at Cop26. We will be there in Glasgow alongside our European sister parties to hold governments to account for future generations. 17. Would you support a progressive alliance with the Liberal Democrats, SNP, Greens and Plaid Cymru around climate action and backing for a green new deal? RLB Labour’s green industrial revolution is one of the most ambitious policy platforms in the world for how a country can decarbonise and be sustainable. It can be a rallying call for the concrete demands we need to implement to meet our climate targets, and put the achievement of social justice and the creation of good, unionised jobs at its heart. I will work with anyone who supports those demands in parliament, across our trade unions, the labour movement, civil society and activists. As Labour leader I will make sure that Labour is part of the coalition keeping this issue high on the political agenda and will resist any moves to restrict the civil liberties of peaceful activists and campaigners ahead of Cop26. At Cop26 I think Labour should push for the UK to adopt more ambitious national targets on climate change, to provide increased levels of public climate finance, and to lead international efforts to establish a new fund for loss and damage. LN I have seen the leadership [Green party MP] Caroline Lucas has brought to the climate debate, and I know that like me she has championed a Green New Deal so yes of course I would work with her and MPs from all parties to make it a reality. KS We need a Labour government to implement a Green New Deal, hardwired into all our policies to mitigate the damage of climate and environmental breakdown, while empowering communities and creating good, green jobs across the country. Every community deserves the right to vote for a Labour government. But we will work with other parties in parliament where they share our aims."

UPDATES: A number of feckless political commentators have simply missed this response I prepared, so I’m posting it to the top for a day or two. I’ll have a follow up on what I’ve learned since then in the next day or two.

——————————————————————————————
As many know, there’s a hearing today in the House of Representatives with the Subcommittee on Energy and Environment, Committee on Science, Space, and  Technology and there are a number of people attending, including Dr. John Christy of UAH and Dr. Richard Muller of the newly minted Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature (BEST) project.
There seems a bit of a rush here, as BEST hasn’t completed all of their promised data techniques that would be able to remove the different kinds of data biases we’ve noted. That was the promise, that is why I signed on (to share my data and collaborate with them). Yet somehow, much of that has been thrown out the window, and they are presenting some results today without the full set of techniques applied. Based on my current understanding, they don’t even have some of them fully working and debugged yet. Knowing that, today’s hearing presenting preliminary results seems rather topsy turvy. But, post normal science political theater is like that.

I have submitted this letter to be included in the record today. It is written for the Members of the committee, to give them a general overview of the issue, so may seem generalized and previously covered in some areas. It also addresses technical concerns I have, also shared by Dr. Pielke Sr. on the issue. I’ll point out that on the front page of the BEST project, they tout openness and replicability, but none of that is available in this instance, even to Dr. Pielke and I. They’ve had a couple of weeks with the surfacestations data, and now without fully completing the main theme of data cleaning, are releasing early conclusions based on that data, without providing the ability to replicate. I’ve seen some graphical output, but that’s it. What I really want to see is a paper and methods. Our upcoming paper was shared with BEST in confidence.
BEST says they will post Dr. Muller’s testimony with a notice on their FAQ’s page which also includes a link to video testimony. So you’ll be able to compare. I’ll put up relevant links later. – Anthony
UPDATE: Dr. Richard Muller’s testimony is now available here. What he proposes about Climate -ARPA is intriguing. I also thank Dr. Muller for his gracious description of the work done by myself, my team, and Steve McIntyre.

Letter of response from Anthony Watts to Dr. Richard Muller testimony 3/31/2011
It has come to my attention that data and information from my team’s upcoming paper, shared in confidence with Dr. Richard Muller, is being used to suggest some early conclusions about the state of the quality of the surface temperature measurement system of the United States and the temperature data derived from it.
Normally such scientific debate is conducted in peer reviewed literature, rather than rushed to the floor of the House before papers and projects are complete, but since my team and I are not here to represent our work in person, we ask that this letter be submitted into the Congressional record.
I began studying climate stations in March 2007, stemming from a curiosity about paint used on the Stevenson Screens (thermometer shelters) used since 1892, and still in use today in the Cooperative Observer climate monitoring network. Originally the specification was for lime based whitewash – the paint of the era in which the network was created. In 1979 the specification changed to modern latex paint. The question arose as to whether this made a difference. An experiment I performed showed that it did. Before conducting any further tests, I decided to visit nearby climate monitoring stations to verify that they had been repainted. I discovered they had, but also discovered a larger and troublesome problem; many NOAA climate stations seemed to be next to heat sources, heat sinks, and have been surrounded by urbanization during the decades of their operation.
The surfacestations.org project started in June 2007 as a result of a collaboration begun with Dr. Roger Pielke Senior. at the University of Colorado, who had done a small scale study (Pielke and Davies 2005) and found identical issues.
Since then, with the help of volunteers, the surfacestations.org project has surveyed over 1000 United States Historical Climatological Network (USHCN) stations, which are chosen by NOAA’s National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) to be the best of the NOAA volunteer operated Cooperative Observer network (COOP). The surfacestations.org project was unfunded, using the help of volunteers nationwide, plus an extensive amount of my own volunteer time and travel. I have personally surveyed over 100 USHCN stations nationwide. Until this project started, even NOAA/NCDC had not undertaken a comprehensive survey to evaluate the quality of the measurement environment, they only looked at station records.
The work and results of the surfacestations.org project is a gift to the citizens of the United States.
There are two methods of evaluating climate station siting quality. The first is the older 100 foot rule implemented by NOAA http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/coop/standard.htm which says:
The [temperature] sensor should be at least 100 feet from any paved or concrete surface.
A second siting quality method is for NOAA’s Climate Reference Network, (CRN) a hi-tech, high quality electronic network designed to eliminate the multitude of data bias problems that Dr. Muller speaks of. In the 2002 document commissioning the project, NOAA’s NCDC implemented a strict code for placement of stations, to be free of any siting or urban biases.
http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/uscrn/documentation/program/X030FullDocumentD0.pdf
The analysis of metadata produced by the surfacestations.org project considered both techniques, and in my first publication on the issue, at 70% of the USHCN surveyed (Watts 2009) I found that only 1 in 10 NOAA climate stations met the siting quality criteria for either the NOAA 100 foot rule or the newer NCDC CRN rating system. Now, two years later, with over 1000 stations, 82.5% surveyed, the 1 in 10 number holds true using NOAA’s own published criteria for rating station siting quality.
Figure 1 Findings of siting quality from the surfacestations project
During the nationwide survey, we found that many NOAA climate monitoring stations were sited in what can only be described as sub optimal locations. For example, one of the worst examples was identified in data by Steven McIntyre as having the highest decadal temperature trend in the United States before we actually surveyed it. We found it at the University of Arizona Atmospheric Sciences Department and National Weather Service Forecast Office, where it was relegated to the center of their parking lot.

This USHCN station, COOP# 028815 was established in May 1867, and has had a continuous record since then. One can safely conclude that it did not start out in a parking lot. One can also safely conclude from human experience as well as peer reviewed literature (Yilmaz, 2009) that temperatures over asphalt are warmer than those measured in a field away from such modern influence.
The surfacestations.org survey found hundreds of other examples of poor siting choices like this. We also found equipment problems related to maintenance and design, as well as the fact the the majority of cooperative observers contacted had no knowledge of their stations being part of the USHCN, and were never instructed to perform an extra measure of due diligence to ensure their record keeping, and that their siting conditions should be homogenous over time.
It is evident that such siting problems do in fact cause changes in absolute temperatures, and may also contribute to new record temperatures. The critically important question is: how do these siting problems affect the trend in temperature?
Other concerns, such as the effect of concurrent trends in local absolute humidity due to irrigation, which creates a warm bias in the nighttime temperature trends, the effect of height above the ground on the temperature measurements, etc. have been ignored in past temperature assessments, as reported in, for example:
Pielke Sr., R.A., C. Davey, D. Niyogi, S. Fall, J. Steinweg-Woods, K. Hubbard, X. Lin, M. Cai, Y.-K. Lim, H. Li, J. Nielsen-Gammon, K. Gallo, R. Hale, R. Mahmood, S. Foster, R.T. McNider, and P. Blanken, 2007: Unresolved issues with the assessment of multi-decadal global land surface temperature trends. J. Geophys. Res., 112, D24S08, doi:10.1029/2006JD008229

These issues are not yet dealt with in Dr. Richard Muller’s analysis, and he agrees.
The abstract of the 2007 JGR paper reads:
This paper documents various unresolved issues in using surface temperature trends as a metric for assessing global and regional climate change. A series of examples ranging from errors caused by temperature measurements at a monitoring station to the undocumented biases in the regionally and globally averaged time series are provided. The issues are poorly understood or documented and relate to micrometeorological impacts due to warm bias in nighttime minimum temperatures, poor siting of the instrumentation, effect of winds as well as surface atmospheric water vapor content on temperature trends, the quantification of uncertainties in the homogenization of surface temperature data, and the influence of land use/land cover (LULC) change on surface temperature trends.
Because of the issues presented in this paper related to the analysis of multidecadal surface temperature we recommend that greater, more complete documentation and quantification of these issues be required for all observation stations that are intended to be used in such assessments. This is necessary for confidence in the actual observations of surface temperature variability and long-term trends.
While NOAA and Dr. Muller have produced analyses using our preliminary data that suggest siting has no appreciable effect, our upcoming paper reaches a different conclusion.
Our paper, Fall et al 2011 titled  “Analysis of the impacts of station exposure on the U.S. Historical Climatology Network temperatures and temperature trends” has this  abstract:
The recently concluded Surface Stations Project surveyed 82.5% of the U.S. Historical Climatology Network (USHCN) stations and provided a classification based on exposure conditions of each surveyed station, using a rating system employed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to develop the U.S. Climate Reference Network (USCRN). The unique opportunity offered by this completed survey permits an examination of the relationship between USHCN station siting characteristics and temperature trends at national and regional scales and on differences between USHCN temperatures and North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) temperatures. This initial study examines temperature differences among different levels of siting quality without controlling for other factors such as instrument type.

Temperature trend estimates vary according to site classification, with poor siting leading to an overestimate of minimum temperature trends and an underestimate of maximum temperature trends, resulting in particular in a substantial difference in estimates of the diurnal temperature range trends.  The opposite-signed differences of maximum and minimum temperature trends are similar in magnitude, so that the overall mean temperature trends are nearly identical across site classifications.  Homogeneity adjustments tend to reduce trend differences, but statistically significant differences remain for all but average temperature trends.  Comparison of observed temperatures with NARR shows that the most poorly-sited stations are warmer compared to NARR than are other stations, and a major portion of this bias is associated with the siting classification rather than the geographical distribution of stations. According to the best-sited stations, the diurnal temperature range in the lower 48 states has no century-scale trend.
The finding that the mean temperature has no statistically significant trend difference that is dependent of siting quality, while the maximum and minimum temperature trends indicates that the lack of a difference in the mean temperatures is coincidental for the specific case of the USA sites, and may not be true globally. At the very least, this raises a red flag on the use of the poorly sited locations for climate assessments as these locations are not spatially representative. 
Whether you believe the century of data from the NOAA COOP network we have is adequate, as Dr. Muller suggests, or if you believe the poor siting placements and data biases that have been documented with the nationwide climate monitoring network are irrelevant to long term trends, there are some very compelling and demonstrative actions by NOAA that speak directly to the issue.
1. NOAA’s NCDC created a new hi-tech surface monitoring network in 2002, the Climate Reference Network, with a strict emphasis on ensuring high quality siting. If siting does not matter to the data, and the data is adequate, why have this new network at all?
2. Recently, while resurveying stations that I previously surveyed in Oklahoma, I discovered that NOAA has been quietly removing the temperature sensors from some of the USHCN stations we cited as the worst (CRN4, 5) offenders of siting quality. For example, here are before and after photographs of the USHCN temperature station in Ardmore, OK, within a few feet of the traffic intersection at City Hall:
Figure 3 Ardmore USHCN station , MMTS temperature sensor, January 2009 
Figure 4 Ardmore USHCN station , MMTS temperature sensor removed, March 2011
NCDC confirms in their meta database that this USHCN station has been closed, the temperature sensor removed, and the rain gauge moved to another location – the fire station west of town. It is odd that after being in operation since 1946, that NOAA would suddenly cease to provide equipment to record temperature from this station just months after being surveyed by the surfacestations.org project and its problems highlighted.
Figure 5 NOAA Metadata for Ardmore, OK USHCN station, showing equipment list
3. Expanding the search my team discovered many more instances nationwide, where USHCN stations with poor siting that were identified by the surfacestations.org survey have either had their temperature sensor removed, closed, or moved. This includes the Tucson USHCN station in the parking lot, as evidenced by NOAA/NCDC’s own metadata online database, shown below:
Figure 6 NOAA Metadata for Tucson USHCN station, showing closure in March 2008
It seems inconsistent with NOAA’s claims of siting effects having no impact that they would need to close a station that has been in operation since 1867, just a few months after our team surveyed it in late 2007 and made its issues known, especially if station siting quality has no effect on the data the station produces.
It is our contention that many fully unaccounted for biases remain in the surface temperature record, that the resultant uncertainty is large, and systemic biases remain. This uncertainty and the systematic biases needs to be addressed not only nationally, but worldwide. Dr. Richard Muller has not yet examined these issues.
Thank you for the opportunity to present this to the Members.

Last weekend’s “three amigos” summit put President Obama’s trade identity crisis on full display. On the one hand, he praised open markets and again vowed to resist protectionist impulses. On the other hand, Obama’s Canadian and Mexican counterparts gave him an earful about US policies harming trade between the three nations.



Such is the state of US trade policy, and nowhere are Obama’s current problems more evident than in the Administration’s new trade enforcement initiative. Announced last month, the program bolsters the efforts of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to snoop in other nations’ closets and ferret out illegal restrictions to U.S. exports.



But while increasing foreign market access for U.S. goods and services is a laudable goal, until the United States gets its own (glass) house in order, the administration’s plans will be ineffective at best and counterproductive at worst.



The White House’s new trade enforcement initiative can be whittled down to three “S“s: more searching, more shaming, and more suing. USTR has promised to expand its targeting of foreign barriers to U.S. exports, to increase diplomatic pressure on trading partners to remove these barriers, and, where diplomacy fails, to bring more cases to the World Trade Organization.



USTR Ron Kirk justified the decision to make trade enforcement a “centerpiece” of American trade policy on the fact that “we need access to foreign markets.” In that sense, he’s right: expanded market access for U.S. farmers, manufacturers and service providers is critically important to the future success of the U.S. economy. Ninety‐​five percent of the world’s consumers live outside America’s borders, and fledgling economies provide especially fertile ground for the seeds of U.S. business. Thus, efforts to ensure that other nations abide by their trading commitments and keep their markets open have been, and should continue to be, an important part of U.S. economic policy.



The United States has some very valid market access concerns. Mischief abounds in this difficult economic climate. But enforcement can only be a centerpiece of American trade policy when the United States meets its own international obligations. Why will countries respect America’s rights in the global trading system when we so commonly and brazenly disrespect their co‐​equal rights?



The quick answer: they probably won’t.



China probably won’t end its baseless restrictions on U.S. pork exports (supposedly to prevent the “swine flu”) while the U.S. maintains similarly groundless restrictions on Chinese poultry imports (supposedly to prevent the 2004 avian flu). Indeed, China has already filed a protest with the WTO over the chicken issue.



Canada probably won’t agree to better police its (allegedly) subsidized lumber market when the United States freely subsidizes its auto sector without regard to global trade rules, and confounds Canadian businesses’ ability to bid on U.S. infrastructure projects with indecipherable “Buy American” restrictions. In fact, Canadian municipalities have already responded with “Don’t Buy American” laws — hardly the ideal political environment for new U.S. enforcement demands.



South Korea probably won’t change onerous automobile emissions standards that keep American cars and trucks out of its market when the United States maintains a 25% tariff on foreign truck imports, sits on a U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement that was signed in 2007, and keeps Mexican trucks off of U.S. roads for equally dubious environmental reasons that have been found to violate NAFTA. (Not to mention those auto subsidies!)



Of course, when the diplomacy fails, there’s always litigation. But compliance with adverse rulings from the WTO — the only global body handling trade disputes between governments — is purely voluntary. Nations found to have violated global trade rules can accept retaliatory tariffs against their exports instead of opening their markets. The United States is a big believer in this “alternative,” refusing to implement multiple WTO rulings against its bloated agricultural subsidies, its biased antidumping law, and its discriminatory gambling restrictions. Of course, this non‐​compliance has serious costs to U.S. companies whose exports face new retaliatory duties, and to the consumers in those now‐​closed foreign markets.



Governments that the U.S. brings to the WTO are likely to follow in our footsteps. So after the administration’s new diplomacy fails and it resorts to WTO litigation, a “victory” in Geneva will most likely mean less market access around the world, not more. And the big losers will be American consumers.



The WTO also will lose out. Because the trade body has no enforcement powers, a fundamental motivation for nations to comply with adverse rulings is to maintain the integrity of the trading system. Non‐​compliance is supposed to be a last resort. So when the United States and other countries increasingly take this route, the system suffers.



In explaining the administration’s “new approach to trade,” USTR Kirk stated, “If they know we are holding a magnifying glass up to their actions, they’ll be less likely to break the rules.” Unless the Obama Administration first turns that magnifying glass inward, its new trade enforcement plan will be a failure — one that could harm American consumers, contract global trade flows and further marginalize the WTO.



That’s not a new approach worth taking.

Veteran journalist Ulli Kulke (DIE WELT) has a finger on the pulse of the climate issue in Europe. In his latest blog piece here, he tells us that the latest readings are barely detectable.

Public’s concern on end-of-world claims is worn out.  (Flood on Java (c.1865-1876) by Raden Saleh: Public domain graphic)
Recently the Climate Vulnerability Monitor, a public study on the impact of climate change worldwide, was released. Needless to say the report was chock full with doom and gloom scenarios, and pleas to world to act now to curb climate change.
It was supposed to thrust the climate change issue back to the forefront and to spur global leaders into immediate action. So what was Europe’s reaction to the Climate Vulnerability Monitor? Yawn.
Kulke writes:

Actually, the new, much ballyhooed study on the imminent end-of-the-world is not worth mentioning. We’ve seen too many of these over the last years, with one being more dubious than the other. At times one could almost feel pity for the authors because nobody really paid attention to them, at least not here in these parts, and that is significant. And all this despite the most super-horror scenarios for the coming decades when it comes to climate change, reaching the highest levels, the UN in New York, from the highest persons, including state and government leaders, also including various NGOs such as Oxfam.”
Recall that the report projects 100 million directly climate-related deaths by 2030, and a litany of other horrors should we fail to act. Yet Kulke oberserves that major media outlets in Germany hardly gave the report the time of day. One can only speculate on the reasons behind this. Perhaps the public has grown tired and unbelieving of the “climate catastrophe”, or perhaps the public is realizing that it’s about poor countries playing the victim role in a bid to push through a vast redistribution scheme (see video at the above link). Kulke writes:
One thing that’s clear is the high level of wearout that scenarios and visions of horror are having with the public.”
Crying wolf may work a couple of times, but after dozens of times, the messenger quickly diminishes and soon gets regarded as the town fool. The Climate Vulnerability Report authors are just the latest fools and nobody is listensing to them. There are other problems out there that are pressing – and real! The financial crisis, to name one.
Kulke sums it up:
No one is interested in the big study. Over the last few days, climate change has been mentioned in the papers more in relationship with the imminent threat to field mice and reindeer. At least that was something new. If it’s really true, that’s a completely different question. Next time.”

Washington is convulsed by politics these days. The presidential election is less than a year away. The House is moving forward on impeaching President Donald Trump. And there is widespread preparation for a possible Supreme Court confirmation battle.



Of course, the last is largely hidden from public view, since there is no vacancy … yet. It is morbid but inevitable business: across the spectrum, officials and activists alike are considering the likely progression of pancreatic cancer in Associate Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. No one wishes her ill, but an election‐​year nomination would trigger an extraordinarily bitter, high‐​stakes battle. So everyone wants to be ready.



Long committed to result‐​oriented jurisprudence, the Left fears that it faces payback from conservative jurists after years of unconstitutional judicial activism. AlterNet’s Jake Johnson warned that “Progressive advocacy groups and legal experts have warned that these right‐​wing judges will have the power to shape U.S. law on climate, reproductive rights, and other major areas for decades to come.” Just like the lefties did who long dominated the federal bench. But they now fear the end is nigh!



Progressive activists are pushing for “reform,” which means filling the courts with robed legislators. Emma Janger of the People’s Parity Project argued, “Without a meaningful plan for court reform any presidential attempts to make needed change will simply be blocked by the courts.” Listen to progressive activists and you hear an echo of Teddy Roosevelt’s famous declaration at the 1912 Republican Party convention that “We stand at Armageddon, and we battle for the Lord.” Yet it is the Left that long ago politicized the judiciary, hijacking the legal process and turning court appointments into brutal political battles.



As originally conceived, the judicial role was important. Alexander Hamilton explained in Federalist No. 78,



The independence of the judges is equally requisite to guard the Constitution and the rights of individuals from the effect of those ill humors, which the arts of designing men, or the influence of particular conjunctures [circumstances], sometimes disseminate among the people themselves, and which, though they speedily give place to better information and more deliberate reflection, have a tendency, in the meantime, to occasion dangerous innovations in the government, and serious oppressions of the minor party in the community.



Nevertheless, the Supreme Court was the least influential branch. Appointments were viewed more as a burden than an honor. The president administered, and Congress legislated. There wasn’t that much for the court to oversee, even after it claimed the right of final review. There simply wasn’t much for justices to do. The first Supreme Court justice, John Jay, quit to run for New York governor.



The judiciary became more important once politicians began to embrace collectivism. First during the Progressive Era and more fully during the early years of the New Deal, the courts sought to vindicate the Constitution by overturning legislation which exceeded government’s constitutional authority. This set off liberal outrage over the supposed attack on and violation of democratic principles. How dare unelected appointees stand in the way of the people’s representatives!



But Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s threat to “pack” the court resulted in the infamous “switch in time that saved nine.” The actuarial tables eventually gave him nine Supreme Court appointments and control of the Supreme Court. Resistance to legislation other than that arguably running afoul of the Bill of Rights essentially disappeared. The original constitutional scheme was dramatically altered without formal amendment.



Worse was to come, however. Modern liberalism advanced faster within the legal profession than the general population, leading to the highly activistic Warren Court. Even after Chief Justice Earl Warren, who was appointed in 1953, had been replaced by Warren Burger, the judiciary continued its radical romp, highlighted by _Roe v. Wade_ , the infamous case legalizing abortion.



Seven justices peered into each other’s eyes and spied constitutional permutations and emanations, which created a heretofore‐​undiscovered “right” to abortion. Unknowingly, those who drafted, approved, and ratified the Constitution created a mandate that overturned the laws of every state and provided a putative mother with the absolute “right” to terminate her baby. The ruling was viewed as extreme at the time, not even genuine constitutional law, since its relation to the constitutional text was minimal. Serious liberals such as Yale Law School’s John Hart Ely were sympathetic to _Roe_ on substance but critical on process. The justices traded their deliberative role in judicial chambers for the partisan combat of legislative bodies.



Conservative anger at such rulings boiled over. House Minority Leader Gerald Ford pushed an effort to impeach Earl Warren. Activist attorneys and think tanks proposed countermeasures, such as stripping the Supreme Court of jurisdiction over issues.



Right‐​leaning scholars promoted the judicial philosophy of “original intent.” There were differences in nuance — exactly whose intent was decisive, and how was it measured? Nevertheless, the meaning given to provisions should reflect the broad political compromise at the time. If folks today want to change the Constitution’s meaning, they should change the text. That was their job, not that of a handful of jurists acting as a continuing constitutional convention with absolute, unreviewable power.



The Reagan administration made judicial appointments accordingly. But its efforts were hampered by candidate Reagan’s promise to appoint a woman (Sandra Day O’Connor may have been the most conservative female candidate available, but she was not particularly conservative) and Anthony Kennedy (a desperation choice after the defeat of a conservative nominee and withdrawal of a more libertarian choice).



The Left recognized the inherent jurisprudential weakness of its effort to make judges act as politicians. If courts could make it up as they went along, anything goes — which makes coherent judicial principles impossible. So much effort was put into justifying the “living” constitution, which meant that progressive judges were entitled to … make it up as they went along, but to do so seemingly as part of an overarching doctrine rather than self‐​serving preference.



Even after multiple GOP appointments the high court remained activist: William Brennan, Harry Blackmun, John Paul Stevens, and David Souter almost immediately went over to the Dark Side. All would have been credible appointments by Democratic presidents. Burger, O’Connor, and Kennedy all tended to accept the general thrust of activist jurisprudence, though resisting its most extreme advance.



So long as the Left still won cases and Democratic presidents were able to add activists to the Supreme Court, progressives accepted the legitimacy of the judiciary. Some district and appellate courts — such as the fabled Ninth Circuit — remained left‐​wing bastions. With Hillary Clinton seemingly poised to deliver the death blow to conservative judicial hopes, replacing originalist architect Antonin Scalia with the nominee of her choice, what wasn’t to like about judicial review and overruling democracy?



Both Republicans and Democrats have poor records defending the role of an independent judiciary when decisions seem to go against them.



What a difference a couple of years make. President Donald Trump reclaimed — or in Democratic parlance, “stole” — the Scalia seat with the more libertarian‐​minded Neil Gorsuch. Then Trump replaced a squishy Kennedy with a more serious conservative, Brett Kavanaugh. (Sen. Elizabeth Warren argued that the president also poached this seat when the Senate eliminated the filibuster from presidential nominations, even though in 2011, Harry Reid’s Democrats began that process, eliminating the filibuster for district and appellate nominations.) Now, still within a single presidential term, the judicial _coup de grace_ looms. It is the progressive icon who might be replaced by a virtual opposite, significantly shifting the balance of the Supreme Court. Plus the 170‐​plus district and circuit court Trump appointments so far. This means that … _unelected judges might preempt Democratic decisions of the people_! Who would have imagined?



This is a terrible crisis! Judges not being on their side! Judges ruling against them! Judges slowing or halting the inevitable progressive revolution and coming utopia! The _New York Times_ columnist Jamelle Bouie warned, “A president supported by a minority of voters may shackle future majorities for decades to come.” He sounds a lot like frustrated conservatives who suffered through rule by activist jurists from the 1960s to 1980s and later. Indeed, Bouie is outraged by what liberals — er, progressives, sorry — once held to be a truism: “What lies over the horizon isn’t just a fight over the meaning of the Constitution; it’s a fight over the power to interpret it. Right now, it appears that power rests with the Supreme Court.” He noted that prior presidents resisted that perspective, including Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Jackson. _Andrew Jackson, the terrible racist, genocidal populist?_ Yup. Bouie contended that the people must reclaim “ultimate interpretive authority” from the Supreme Court.



Democrats once complained about Republican “litmus tests” on abortion for judicial appointees. Now, they treat _Roe_ as the essential precedent, which any nominee must affirm. Washington State governor and brief presidential candidate Jay Inslee declared, “I’m open to any idea that can make sure a woman’s right of choice is protected.” _New York_ magazine’s Ed Kilgore complained that Trump “broke every taboo by explicitly promising conservative Evangelicals a SCOTUS that would abolish a federal constitutional right to choose abortion.” Party activists and elites are even working overtime to purge the Democratic congressional caucus of anyone less than pure on _Roe_.



More broadly, Democratic presidential candidates and left‐​wing activists alike are debating proposals to destroy the traditional judicial independence. Most of the ideas center around court‐​packing. Add seats to the Supreme Court, maybe a lot of them, and fill them with wannabe legislators. A law degree might be helpful. But the main qualification would be the belief that the Constitution requires implementation of the latest progressive agenda.



There are other ideas. Warren promised to appoint a worker‐​advocate, which presumably means someone who reads the Constitution ideologically rather than legally, creates accountability measures such as fast‐​tracking judicial impeachment (which the Constitution — remember that document? — leaves to the House), and adds appellate judges to Supreme Court cases (not sure how that would work). Mayor Pete Buttigieg proposed an odd system with five Democrats, five Republicans, and five “nonpolitical” jurists chosen by the others.



The one sensible idea is term limits. The details are negotiable. Imagine nominating judges to serve, say, eight‐​year or 18‐​year terms. Stagger appointments so every president gets a couple, unless illness or accident upsets the process. Even then, service would be for the rest of the term, with reappointment possible.



This would offer several important advantages: judges would still be insulated from direct political pressure, court diversity would increase, “bad” appointees would not serve for life, and individual nominations would be less important and thus less worth a fight to the political death. Both parties would have reason to back such an approach. Most important, though, the judiciary would remain free to fulfill its originally intended role: an independent branch of government intended to balance and check the other two.



But this won’t satisfy many on the left. Of course, everything is the GOP’s fault, since “their own efforts to pack the courts with ideologues have broken the system,” as Kilgore argued. Uh, how many conservatives and libertarians, let alone Republicans, did Barack Obama appoint? How many would Hillary Clinton have chosen? Republicans used the same system that Democrats used for years.



It actually comes down to political power. Brian Fallon of Demand Justice was refreshingly frank: “Democrats cannot sit back and accept the status quo of a partisan Republican five‐​seat majority for the next 30 years.” He said, “We don’t consider those two seats that Trump has filled to be legitimate.” Ian Millhiser of ThinkProgress argued, “If the Supreme Court’s current majority is committed to one‐​party rule, then Congress must create a new majority on the Supreme Court that will return power to the voters.”



Of course, the definition of being “committed to one‐​party rule” is deciding contrary to Democratic preferences on controversial legislation such as the Voting Rights Act. Millhiser explained,



If the Supreme Court goes down this road, and it is more likely than not that it will, this assault on voting rights will not happen in isolation. With Kavanaugh on the Court, _Roe v. Wade_ is doomed. Religious conservatives will most likely gain even more rights to discriminate. Laws protecting workers from rapacious employers could be watered down to nothing. And any major legislation signed by a Democratic President is in serious jeopardy for the foreseeable future.



It is a daunting list, but one without much connection either to law or the Constitution, which are areas where _Roe_ fails. In fact, that case already has been altered, though only incrementally over the years. Nor is a radical majority likely. Chief Justice John Roberts has been particularly reluctant to overturn signal legislative initiatives, such as Obamacare, which he saved by using a taxation argument largely dismissed by the legal community.



The majority never likes to be checked by the minority. But the only guarantee of essential but sometimes unpopular rights is often the courts. Millhiser suggested that everything would be okay if the threat of court‐​packing caused the court to moderate, meaning again make it all up when the zeitgeist struck. Or if Republicans joined to support “a constitutional amendment depoliticizing the judicial selection process,” whatever that means. After all, Democrats have been no less partisan than Republicans when appointing Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and a crowd of progressives before them.



The fastest, surest way to destroy the judicial branch is for a partisan Democratic takeover by manipulating the process. That would trigger a race to the bottom: Republicans would have little choice but to respond in kind. Indeed, they might expand the process, adding extra circuit and district court judges, as well.



At least Millhiser admitted, “Court‐​packing is a dangerous tactic, though. If either party resorts to court‐​packing, they risk destroying the legitimacy of the judiciary.” Or there might be a return to the 1960s, with Republican campaigns to oust hyper‐​interventionists and remove court jurisdiction over anything that matters. Progressives then might ruefully remember why they once believed in the judiciary as a bulwark against government abuse. The _Spectator_ ’s Dov Fischer warned, “As soon as people begin to perceive that judges are not following pre‐​established and properly enacted rules of the game but instead simply are ‘making up rules they personally prefer,’ the entire system of justice collapses.”



The Senate Democratic caucus already is enjoying payback for previous decisions. Democrats filibustered eminently qualified judicial nominees by President George W. Bush. A compromise was reached that avoided a challenge to the filibuster itself. But when GOP legislators filibustered President Barack Obama’s court nominees, the Democratic majority eliminated the practice for district and appellate nominees. Democrats sought to filibuster Gorsuch, President Donald Trump’s first Supreme Court nominee, so the GOP eliminated the practice for high court nominees as well — an inevitable decision, since the filibuster is sustainable only if both sides respect it. Sen. Jon Tester (D‐​Mont.) now admits that his 2011 vote to eliminate the filibuster was “probably the biggest mistake I ever made.”



Both Republicans and Democrats have poor records defending the role of an independent judiciary when decisions seem to go against them. In the 1960s, conservatives ignored the importance of judicial review when they sought to hamstring judges. A half‐​century later, many liberals have become unbridled majoritarians, abandoning the tool they once believed to be essential for defending individuals against the overweening state. Perhaps this should come as no surprise. These days the Left rarely even pretends to have any interest in freedom. If liberty isn’t important, who needs independent judges?



Those on the left should ask themselves, however, if the democracy‐​dependent courts that they now desire would have issued _Brown v. Board of Education_ , which finally overturned the infamous decision enshrining segregation, _Plessy v. Ferguson_. Would any of the civil libertarian decisions celebrated by the Left have received a majority court vote and survived the popular backlash? Free speech almost certainly would have been sharply curtailed years or decades ago.



Progressives should listen to their better angels. It was Democrats who blocked President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s infamous court‐​packing plan. Historian Michael Parrish wrote that the initiative “divided the New Deal coalition, squandered the political advantage Roosevelt had gained in the 1936 elections, and gave fresh ammunition to those who accused him of dictatorship, tyranny, and fascism.”



Some modern Democrats express similar concerns. For instance, Sen. Michael Bennet warned against joining “in that demolition” of the judicial appointment process by Republicans. Sen. Cory Booker worried that retaliatory court‐​packing could result in a grandchild asking, “Hey, Granddad, why are there 121 people on the Supreme Court?” And the Left’s celebrated judicial standard‐​bearer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, warned that mass appointments “would make the court look partisan. It would be that — one side saying, ‘When we’re in power, we’re going to enlarge the number of judges, so we would have more people who would vote the way we want them to.’ ” She said that even though she has lost influence as the Trump appointees took their seats.



Millhiser admitted that “while the price of court‐​packing is high, the price of failing to rein in a rogue Supreme Court could potentially be even higher.” Presumably Jerry Ford and many GOP legislators agreed with that sentiment a half century ago. Both sides underestimated the risk to liberty, captured by that famous, if overly quoted, scene from _A Man for All Seasons_ , in which Thomas More warns that “This country’s planted thick with laws from coast to coast — man’s laws, not God’s — and if you cut them down … do you really think you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then?”



Will an independent judiciary survive? Warren declared, “It’s not about the expansion, it’s about depoliticizing the Supreme Court.” But the Left has shamelessly politicized the courts for decades. Despite their charming rhetoric about protecting democracy, left‐​wing activists are most frustrated because _the American people_ continue to resist plans for a socialist, gender‐​free, PC paradise. That is what _Roe_ was all about, turning the court into a small‐​scale legislature controlled by the Left. Democrats fear that in the future they will be unable to rely on the courts to impose policies resisted by the American people.



The only way to depoliticize the courts is to stop demanding that they decide political and partisan rather than legal and constitutional disputes. If the Democratic Party wants to expand state power, it should strive to convince the American people. And if Democrats want to end constitutional restrictions on expansive government, they should amend the Constitution. Not use judges to subvert the legal order.

"**Discussions have been taking place about whether the Christmas school holidays could be extended in Scotland.**
It has been suggested that the dates could be standardised across the country, with all schools closing on 18 December and reopening on 11 January.
Holiday dates vary between different council areas, with most schools due to return between the 5 and 7 January.
The proposal is designed to limit the spread of Covid after families get together for Christmas.
The issue was discussed at the Scottish government's education recovery group, but no decisions have yet been made.
The group brings together a number of stakeholders in the education sector, including unions, councils and the government.
A document from Thursday's meeting was leaked to the Daily Record newspaper.
The memo says the government is considering a national extension to the holidays, with schools either remaining closed or introducing remote learning for a temporary period.
At the daily briefing, Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said the Scottish government was very conscious that parents, teachers and pupils wanted to know what was going to happen.
""We will make sure that we reach a view based on the advice from that expert recovery group, and make sure that we reach a view as soon as we can so that people do have advance notice,"" she said.
""We want to give people as much notice as possible if there is to be any change at all, but at this point that decision hasn't been reached.""
Ms Freeman said it would be wrong to ""overly speculate or jump to conclusions"" just because they were looking at the issue.
""The deputy first minister (John Swinney) and his colleagues will be working through what they think is the best way for schools to enter the Christmas break and come out of the Christmas break - and that applies to colleges and universities as well,"" she added.
There are a number of important issues to be discussed about changing the holiday dates.
First of all parents will want clarity - changes to the dates could mean people having to arrange childcare or take time off work.
Secondly, if schools return a few days later than planned in January, some secondary schools may want to change prelim dates.
Thirdly, councils are protective of their role in the education system. They would want to ensure any standardisation of dates in an emergency does not set a precedent.
And there is, of course, also the question of whether an extended school holiday would by itself make any meaningful difference to the efforts to control coronavirus.
The BBC understands councils will discuss the matter again on Friday.
It is expected that the education recovery group will meet on Wednesday to discuss the potential impact on exams, and that a decision could be made on the holiday extension next week.
While many schools are already due to close on 18 December, others are set to remain open until 23 December. The dates for returning to school in January also vary.
The memo says that extending the holidays would act as a break following the relaxation of rules over the festive period.
However, concerns are raised over the time needed to set up the remote learning, and the potential impact caused by the loss of emergency childcare which had previously been provided by school staff.
School holidays have traditionally varied in different council areas across Scotland, but the start of the autumn term was standardised in August as schools reopened for the first time since March.
Scottish Greens co-leader Alison Johnstone told the BBC's daily briefing programme that parents and pupils needed clarity on extending the Christmas school holidays.
""We have learned about this today through a leak to a newspaper so I think transparency and clarity are key here,"" she said.
The Scottish Conservatives' education spokesman Jamie Greene said any further ""watering down"" of pupils' time in class would need to be ""properly catered for at home"".
He added: ""Every child should have access to proper IT equipment and learning materials to ensure they don't fall behind with their studies.""

My colleague Dan Griswold pointed out yesterday some unfortunate editing in the _Washington Post._ Here are a couple of other trade-related items in the news recently:   




I think often the United States has to lead,"" Baucus said, noting that what lawmakers come up could be used as a model for other countries to copy.



So the U.S. would saddle its consumers with higher prices in exchange for little benefit environmentally and in the process risk retaliation and alienating countries who it insists are necessary for global cooperation on climate change?   
  
Some leadership.   
  
And it may well be that the Chinese have the jump on the United States here, in any case. They're proposing to introduce a carbon tax of their own, to prevent double-taxation in the form of carbon tariffs by the developed countries (banned under WTO rules) and to keep the carbon tax revenue -- collected, remember, from U.S. consumers! -- for themselves, all while seeming to play nice on climate change. I bet those who proposed carbon tariffs are sorry they spoke out now. (HT: Scott Lincicome)

"While the world rightfully focuses on the Covid-19 pandemic, the planet is still warming. This summer’s Antarctic weather, as elsewhere in the world, was unprecedented in the observed record. Our research, published today in Global Change Biology, describes the recent heatwave in Antarctica. Beginning in late spring east of the Antarctic Peninsula, it circumnavigated the continent over the next four months. Some of our team spent the summer in Antarctica observing these temperatures and the effect on natural systems, witnessing the heatwave first hand. Antarctica may be isolated from the rest of the continents by the Southern Ocean, but has worldwide impacts. It drives the global ocean conveyor belt, a constant system of deep-ocean circulation which transfers oceanic heat around the planet, and its melting ice sheet adds to global sea level rise. Antarctica represents the simple, extreme end of conditions for life. It can be seen as a “canary in the mine”, demonstrating patterns of change we can expect to see elsewhere. Most of Antarctica is ice-covered, but there are small ice-free oases, predominantly on the coast. Collectively 0.44% of the continent, these unique areas are important biodiversity hotspots for penguins and other seabirds, mosses, lichens, lakes, ponds and associated invertebrates. This summer, Casey Research Station, in the Windmill Islands oasis, experienced its first recorded heatwave. For three days, minimum temperatures exceeded zero and daily maximums were all above 7.5C. On 24 January, its highest maximum of 9.2C was recorded, almost 7C above Casey’s 30-year mean for the month. The arrival of warm, moist air during this weather event brought rain to Davis Research Station in the normally frigid, ice-free desert of the Vestfold Hills. The warm conditions triggered extensive meltwater pools and surface streams on local glaciers. These, together with melting snowbanks, contributed to high-flowing rivers and flooding lakes. By February, most heat was concentrated in the Antarctic Peninsula at the northernmost part of the continent. A new Antarctic maximum temperature of 18.4C was recorded on 6 February at Argentina’s Esperanza research station on the peninsula – almost 1C above the previous record. Three days later this was eclipsed when 20.75C was reported at Argentina’s Marambio station, on Seymour Island east of the peninsula. The pace of warming from global climate change has been generally slower in East Antarctica compared with West Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula. This is in part due to the ozone hole, which has occurred in spring over Antarctica since the late 1970s. The hole has tended to strengthen jet stream winds over the Southern Ocean, promoting a generally more “positive” state of the Southern Annular Mode in summer. This means the Southern Ocean’s westerly wind belt has tended to stay close to Antarctica at that time of year creating a seasonal “shield”, reducing the transfer of warm air from the Earth’s temperate regions to Antarctica. But during the spring of 2019 a strong warming of the stratosphere over Antarctica significantly reduced the size of the ozone hole. This helped to support a more “negative” state of the Southern Annular Mode and weakened the shield. Other factors in late 2019 may have also helped to warm Antarctica. The Indian Ocean Dipole was in a strong “positive” state due to a late retreat of the Indian monsoon. This meant that water in the western Indian Ocean was warmer than normal. Air rising from this and other warm ocean patches in the Pacific Ocean provided energy sources that altered the path of weather systems and helped to disturb and warm the stratosphere. Localised flooding appeared to benefit some of Vestfold Hills’ moss banks that were previously very drought-stressed. Prior to the flood event, most mosses were grey and moribund, but a month later many moss shoots were green. Given the generally cold conditions of Antarctica, the warmth may have benefited the flora (mosses, lichens and two vascular plants) and microbes and invertebrates, but only where liquid water formed. Areas in the Vestfold Hills away from the flooding became more drought-stressed over the summer. High temperatures may have caused heat stress in some organisms. Antarctic mosses and lichens are often dark in colour, allowing sunlight to be absorbed to create warm microclimates. This is a great strategy when temperatures are just above freezing, but heat stress can occur once 10C is exceeded. On King George Island, near the Antarctic Peninsula, our measurements showed that in January 2019 moss surface temperatures exceeded 14C for only 3% of the time, but in 2020 this increased fourfold (to 12% of the time). Based on our experience from previous anomalous hot Antarctic summers, we can expect many biological impacts, positive and negative, in coming years. The most recent event highlights the connectedness of our climate systems: from the surface to the stratosphere, and from the monsoon tropics to the southernmost continent. Under climate change, extreme events are predicted to increase in frequency and severity, and Antarctica is not immune.

The share of renewable energies in Germany’s power mix has shot up so high that the electricity grid and the subsidy framework has been unable to keep up. Now, the government wants to slow down the process. German commentators say that the current chaos endangers the entire project.

"Ancient woodlands and flower-rich meadows have disappeared to make way for agriculture and urbanisation, but attempts are being made to reverse the decline using “green” farming projects. The question is, are they working? Known as agri-environmental schemes, under these farmers are paid to manage the land in ways that are more conducive to wildlife. They also bring benefits to the farm: encouraging species of birds and insects that control crop pests, and attracting more pollinators for flowering crops.  But trying to establish how effective these schemes are involves taking measurements by walking through fields – a laborious and time-intensive process that’s impossible to do on a large scale. Instead, we have found a way to recruit bees to do the work for us. Each of the tens of thousands of bees within a hive is a little information-gathering machine that flies, rather than walks, similar sorties through the fields on our behalf collecting information. A bee that has found a good source of nectar or pollen will tell her nestmates, and she does so by using “waggle dance” language, a figure-of-eight move that indicates to others the distance and direction from the hive of flower patches that are of value to them. Our research published in the journal Current Biology eavesdrops on this waggle dance communication between bees, so we can tell which areas they value for sources of nectar and pollen. Even though each bee knows only a fraction of the landscape, the colonies as a whole cover a lot of ground: bees from our study surveyed about 94km2. By combining the bees’ selected areas with the location of agri-environmental schemes we can establish which of those human efforts to improve the landscape impress pollinators. And what do the bees prefer? We need to account for how bees rank a source of food. For both pollen and nectar, we know that foragers’ willingness to dance for the source increases with the quality of the treasure, whether that’s sugar-concentrated nectar or the protein-rich pollen. The worker bees out collecting also consider the distance to the food: can they get sufficient food from the corner store to not warrant travelling to the large supermarket many kilometres away? After accounting for the time and energy spent flying several kilometres back and forth, a flower patch considered high quality if near the hive may make for a poor meal if located further afield. So we too had to take the distance into account in our analysis and counteract it by giving greater weight to dances that indicate locations at greater distances. The University of Sussex lies at the northeastern boundary of Brighton, so bees from the hives on campus have access to urban areas and open fields, and those fields that include agri-environment scheme areas. Perhaps the crown jewels in this landscape are Castle Hill National Nature Reserve to the southeast and Ditchling Beacon local nature reserve to the northwest.  After making allowances for distance, it turns out that the university campus bees ranked these first and second in preference. Overall, they preferred land managed under the UK agri-environmental schemes called Higher Level Stewardships, under which farmers set aside land and field margins on which to grow wildflowers and plants for the long term. Interestingly they seemed averse to land managed under another scheme, the Organic Entry Level Stewardships. So what do the bees choices tell us? The nature reserve areas most visited by bees are managed mainly to attract butterflies and moths, but as wildflower-rich chalk grasslands they are also attractive to honeybees. Clearly the conservation efforts pay off, as they provide pollinators with food which might be sparse in areas of more intensively managed rural lands.  The fact that bees prefer the nature reserves is proof that honeybee hives are capable of finding and indicating areas we suspect are good. The bees also liked some areas managed under agri-environmental schemes, which shows that the money given to farmers to manage their land with wildlife in mind is well spent – at least as far as bees are concerned. Hopefully, if our study is replicated at other locations we might learn more about which specific sets of plants or styles of land management benefit them most. Our study shows that bees, due to their large foraging range and ability to carefully evaluate the quality of food available are good indicators of landscape quality. Studying where honey bees forage can reveal where benefits can be had for other insect pollinators too. Watching the waggle dance could be used where building projects are underway, to ascertain the quality of land that may be lost. How useful is the land that might be lost to bees if the Thames Estuary Airport is built? Should we build that football stadium next to a nature reserve? Can the planting of flower-rich margins lessen our impact? Our method gives ecological consultants a tool to answer these and similar questions – we just have to listen to the bees."
"**Tighter Covid restrictions in Wales before Christmas would be ""incredibly difficult"" for the hospitality sector, the industry is warning.**
It comes after Health Minister Vaughan Gething said new rules could be introduced if infection rates ""move in the wrong direction"".
The Welsh Government's cabinet is meeting on Friday to discuss its latest response to the pandemic.
Tougher rules are being introduced in England from next week.
Those measures will mean 55 million people remain banned from mixing with other households indoors from 2 December.
Asked if tougher coronavirus restrictions would be introduced in Wales, Mr Gething said: ""It's entirely possible and that isn't something that I celebrate.
""I never came into politics to intervene in the way people live their lives in this sort of way.
""But if we don't do something, we'll stand by while people are coming to harm and we can't do that.
""If case numbers move in the wrong direction we may have to do something different.""
First Minister Mark Drakeford has said previously he is considering tougher restrictions in Wales, similar to coronavirus rules in place in areas in the upper end of the tier systems of England and Scotland.
Founder of the Welsh Independent Restaurant Collective, Simon Wright told BBC Radio Wales' Breakfast on Friday, there needs to be clarity for the hospitality sector ahead of the festive period.
""It's been a year of great struggle - a year of stop-start - mostly stop,"" said Mr Wright, who runs a restaurant in Carmarthen.
""We are approaching the time of year when people would anticipate being at their busiest. We weren't anticipating this post-firebreak, not being able to trade before Christmas.
""If something like that happens, it is going to be a huge blow.
""There's a lot of trepidation around Wales this morning in terms of businesses and staff in the hospitality trade.""
Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price expressed his concerns and said health and economic polices had to ""work in tandem"", particularly if the Welsh Government is considering stricter rules for pubs and restaurants.
He said: ""If they're closing businesses, I would like to see the Welsh Government providing a higher level of support to the those businesses to help them effectively hibernate and survive through this difficult period.""
The Conservative's health spokesman in the Senedd, Andrew RT Davies, said he wanted to see the most vulnerable people shielded and focused Covid testing in known hotspots.
He added: ""This will be potentially the fourth-stroke-fifth set of regulations within two months that the people of Wales will have to adapt to.
""I want the government to be successful, because ultimately if [it] is successful then we've beaten the virus. But regrettably, we are not seeing that happen.""
Three households from around the UK will be able to meet from 23 December until at least 27 December following an agreement between the UK government and ministers in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland."

==========================================
Few US organizations are feared and hated in Germany like the Heartland Institute is today. It’s probably number 2 on the list behind Marc Morano/CFACT.

Welcome to Germany, Joe. They’ve already let the blood hounds loose.
The Heartland Institute is supporting this weekend’s skeptic climate conference in Munich, being held by the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) and is thus playing a role in urging the German public to take a closer look at the global warming science and the data underpinning it.
This, for the German climate hysteria movement, is intolerable. Heartland’s success at exposing the bad science behind global warming must not be repeated here in Germany…which is the holy alter of the climate catastrophe movement. It is the last real bastion.
Heartland must expect an extremely hostile welcome.
Already the warmists have mobilized and launched a campaign to tar and feather the public image of the Heartland Institute.
The latest attack piece is one by Kevin Grandia of desmogblog and it appears at the fundamentalist warmist site klimaretter.de (climate rescuer) here in German. One of the contributors at “climate rescuer” is, by the way, Toralf Staud, who happens to be a journalist at the fundamentalist green Die Zeit weekly. Stefan Rahmstorf also donates to klimaretter.
In the latest klimaretter piece, Grandia writes that “the Heartland Institute normally spreads its mischief in the USA” but there it has been discredited. “Now the notorious institute is trying to find new friends in Germany. It has found one.” Grandia writes that “at the conference in Munich, a small group of unqualified “experts” gets together to talk about their conspiracy theory that climate change is a “hoax”.
However the fact is that EIKE and the Heartland Institute are only interested in offering an alternative view of climate science, and to get answers to open questions. They have openly invited warmist scientists to attend. But instead of accepting and engaging in a dialogue, the warmists have responded with extremely hostile reactions and sharp intolerance. “There’s nothing to discuss. We are right,” they insist.

Grandia’s malicious piece has nothing to do with promoting the development of science and dialogue; rather it has everything to do with trying to marginalize and destroy perceived threats to their movement using Alinsky tactics. They’ve gotten very good at this, we have to admit, but they are still losing more than ever.
Grandia presents an idea to the German readers:


I suspect the group is taking their event overseas where the media is less likely to know the long and sordid details of Heartland’s other efforts to attack conventionally accepted scientific conclusions. Not to mention Heartland’s offensive Unabomber billboard campaign and a long list of other outrageous stunts.
Perhaps the Heartland Institute is banking on the German media’s failure to Google search for evidence of the group’s long history of attacks on science and efforts to confuse the public about climate change and an array or other threats to public health and the planet.”


The objective reader here should ask: Is it really about downplaying threats, or is it about exaggerating them? We haven’t seen warming in 16 years.
Grandia then gives the warmists’ take on the Heartland Institute, describing to readers its “dirty and climate-damaging business fields”, for example Koch Industries and the activities on behalf of Big Tobacco – ten years ago.
He then fast forwards to the present and claims Joseph Bast today is using the same tactics to spread doubt over climate science. He writes:


Bast is banking on the media overseas not knowing what media here in North America knows about Heartland’s shady corporate front group operation. Here, they are an organization completely discredited in the eyes of major media.
So my question now is: Will media in Germany fall for Bast and the Heartland’s latest attacks on reputable science and scientists? Will German media cover this year’s Denial-a-Palooza with a hefty dose of skepticism, or give them a platform to wrecklessly spread more confusion and doubt?
What do you think?


I think you’re scared excrementless. Why are you so trembly-handed over an open discussion?
It’s obvious. Although the skeptics are out-funded (by a factor of at least 100), doubt over climate catastrophism keeps growing and spreading. Why? Could it have something to do with the desolate quality of the warmist science?
Keep in mind that:
1. Temperatures have not risen in 16 years.
2. Hurricanes are near record lows (forget the media hype).
3. Sea levels have decelerated.
4. Antarctic sea ice has expanded over the last 30 years.
5. Over the last 10,000 years it was warmer than today 60% of the time. Etc.
These are the things the many skeptic scientists want to debate. But the warmists only want to hide from the media and public. They prefer to sling mud from the hinterhalt.
The German warmists need to understand that it’s impossible to win this battle. They’ll see soon enough.

"Boston has endured several tumultuous eras, from being the birthplace of the American revolution to its seesawing fortunes as power and influence was wrested away by other US cities. Now Boston faces its most existential threat yet – the rising seas. Ironically, Boston is experiencing a surge in waterfront development at the very moment its growing risk to disastrous flooding becomes clear. The refashioning of Boston’s waterfront holds valuable lessons to other cities threatened by sea level rise – in terms of innovation but also wrenching concerns over displaced communities. The economics are now optimal for developers to repurpose the post-industrial landscape of East Boston and other neighbourhoods in the city but this epoch also comes comes with the added costs of the climate crisis. “It is an unfortunate quirk of timing,” admitted Nick Iselin, the general manager of development at Lendlease. Last summer, the property company completed the first phase of its Clippership Wharf development in East Boston, on the Boston Harbor waterfront. Nearly all of the 284 apartments have already been snapped up, with a second site in the same project set to be completed this year. In all, there will be 478 residencies on the seven-acre site. City authorities are planning around a contingency of 40 inches of sea level rise by 2070 – a scenario that would inundate large swathes of Boston. The seeds of Boston’s vulnerability to the climate crisis was unknowingly sown as the city became a bustling trading port in the 1800s. The booming city tripled in geographic land area by filling in tidal flats and marshland with rocks and dirt, using this land for residential housing as well as sights such as Faneuil Hall and the New England Aquarium. Planes landing at Boston’s Logan international airport rumble along filled-in land that was once a string of islands. The core of the city is perched on low-lying land along a lengthy artificial shoreline – a perilous situation in an era when seawater is piling up along the US east coast from the heating-up of the seas and the melting of glaciers. Boston is now the world’s eighth most vulnerable coastal city to potential damages from sea level rise, according to the World Bank. The sea that laps at Boston rose by nine inches over the past century, with diverse districts such as Dorchester facing the prospect of being drowned by the end of the century. Already, some Boston streets flood even on sunny days, just with the high tide. Developers in Boston are attempting to stare down this challenge, however. Clippership Wharf is flanked by two other expensive developments in varying stages of construction, both using standard forms of reinforced seawalls and barriers to stop their investments becoming inundated. But Lendlease is embracing an approach more attuned to nature, one that leans upon the idea of living with the encroaching water rather than waging war against it – an ethos more common in the Netherlands or Venice than the US. Clippership Wharf has Boston Harbor’s first “living shoreline” – a network of natural plantings, salt marshes, rocky beaches and wildlife habitats aimed at dissipating waves from storms and subtly taming the high tides. You get from the condos to the waterfront via a series of tiered grassy embankments that bring you down to a publicly-accessible boardwalk overlooking a jumble of rocks and, on one side, the remnants of an antiquated seawall that has been partially given over to the water and seeded with salt marshes to provide a more natural buffer to the advancing harbor. Seawalls, by contrast, often cause the erosion of land or beach in front of them and can simply push water on to neighbouring properties. In many ways, this Boston development is a model for how America should be building on the coastline in an age of climate breakdown. “We’ve repatriated the shoreline with native species, this is more like what it would have been 150 years ago,” Iselin said. “In four or five years you’ll see the salt marsh starting to take shape. “I think it takes a certain caliber of developer to think that way, but I think more and more developers are. The challenge is not thinking that way, it’s figuring out a way to implement it because the solutions are more difficult, both from a regulatory perspective and from a cost perspective.” The developers haven’t left too much to chance – Clippership Wharf has been elevated to 14ft above the average high tide in the harbor, which waxes and wanes every six hours. Deployable wooden barriers are slotted into place ahead of a storm, while an underground car garage includes water pumps and an emergency back-up generator. These adaptions caused consternation among city authorities about a gradient mismatch with surrounding streets but the inclines are fairly gentle and are still wheelchair-accessible. A more potent concern is that the climate crisis is accelerating existing gentrification of what was once a solidly working class area. Apartments at Clippership Wharf will cost you about $5,500 a month for three bedrooms, with condos available to buy for as much as $1.75m. These new abodes are built on a site that was vacant for 30 years, a patch of contaminated soil left over from the heyday of the harbor being a frenzy of goods shipped on to wharves that stretched out into the water. Lendlease has clearly done a sterling job of opening up a waterfront path to the general public, but the “perception of gentrification is very real”, Iselin conceded. Boston has one of the more progressive city leaderships when it comes to the climate crisis – its Climate Ready Boston plan sets out the challenge in detailed and stark terms – but, still, low-income residents of East Boston worry that they will be the worst hit when the water starts lapping on to roads and into basements. The city has had one near miss – Superstorm Sandy, which crunched into New York City in 2012, would have left many Bostonians hip-deep in water had it arrived at high, rather than low, tide. Some residents, not shielded by the expansive defenses and water pumps of the new developments, fear they won’t be so lucky next time. “Where I live was built in 2003 and that was not built to be climate resilient – all the critical utilities are in the basement, which could flood,” said Magdalena Ayed, the founder of environmental justice group the Harborkeepers who lives in subsidized housing just a few hundred feet from Clippership Wharf. “The question is where does the water go (from the new development), will it go in and behind to us?” Originally from Argentina, Ayed moved to Boston 14 years ago and has seen East Boston’s waterfront rapidly change into a place where only the relatively wealthy, perhaps working in Boston’s growing biotech sector, are able to afford. The new developments will only push up rents for everyone else, she worries. “Boston was built on the backs of hardworking people, we are a hub of immigrants – Ukrainians, Irish Americans, Italian Americans, Vietnamese, Latinos and north Africans,” Ayed said. “That’s still the case but it’s changing. I don’t even make a living wage, I wish I could afford to live in one of these new buildings but I can’t. I probably won’t be able to ever afford it.” Ayed said that Lendlease “deserves a lot of credit” for thoughtfully protecting its patch of the shoreline but said she’s worried about the impact of flooding upon the elderly and less mobile in the public housing behind the new developments. In 2018, two nasty storms threatened to flood East Boston homes, with public transport grinding to a halt. “The bigger question is whether we should even be building in these flood zones,” Ayed said. “The whole managed retreat issue is the elephant in the room.” Boston, a famously feisty city not prone to meek surrender, certainly isn’t contemplating the abandonment of its waterfront. The mayor, Marty Walsh, has committed 10% of the city’s budget to making Boston more resilient to climate change, through a series of efforts to raise pathways, erect seawalls and install natural barriers known as berms. A competing idea, to creating an enormous harbor barrier costing around $12bn, has been shelved. The task of transforming Boston into a modern, climate-adapted place while not pushing out its long-term working class is a conundrum that is set to play out in other cities along America’s eastern seaboard. The issue of climate gentrification is already starting to bite in Miami, for example, where minority communities long established on higher ground have complained they are being inundated by shiny new apartment blocks for wealthy residents who are seeking safer ground. “As we look at resilience, equity has to be at the heart of it,” said Christopher Cook, Boston’s chief of environment, energy and open space, who pointed to several projects around Boston aimed at protecting low-income neighborhoods rather than displacing them. “Success is giving everyone equal access to the harbor. The real benefit of nature based solutions is that they can be adaptive, you can give socially vulnerable populations a recreation space. Seawalls can’t do that. But we have to be concerned (about gentrification). If this is all just for wealthy people we won’t have been successful.” Even for a city with a detailed plan, there are gaps to fill in. Boston can require developers to erect berms, for example, but who then is responsible for maintaining them? If developers are left to protect their own plot of land, how do you best ensure there is a coherent, joined-up response to sea level rise along the whole waterfront? Who pays for all of this? Big cities like Boston can muddle through a lot of these questions themselves but the vast US coastline faces a hopefully mismatched response to the swelling seas. There is no overarching federal government strategy to deal with sea level rise, a phenomena that’s on course to displace an astounding 13 million Americans, according to a University of Georgia in Athens study, with the Trump administration dismantling the few federal requirements to build with the climate crisis in mind. “The challenge is enormous, so much so that it could be paralyzing,” said Cook. “We’ve taken on challenges over time, though, and this is just the next stage in this. “But we do need strong federal leadership – frankly we needed it 10 years ago. Washington DC needs to focus on protecting coastal cities, because a lot of them don’t have the flexibility we do.” This story is a part of Covering Climate Now’s week of coverage focused on Climate Solutions, to mark the 50th anniversary of Earth Day.

Guest Post by Willis Eschenbach
One response to Christopher Booker graciously mentioning my work in the Telegraph is the predictable increase in the usual personal attacks on me, as opposed to attacking my ideas and claims. People are rehashing Tim Lambert calling me a liar because he disagreed with my methods, as though that meant something about me rather than simply revealing something about Tim. They point out that I am an amateur scientist (as though that were other than a badge of honor). I’m told that I’m out of my depth. I am constantly assured that I am not qualified to offer a scientific opinion on climate, because of my lack of academic qualifications (BA in Psychology), and because of the shortness of my scientific publications list. The supply of reasons given to try to convince people to ignore my work is seemingly endless. To hear people tell it, I’m not fit to kiss the boots of a true scientist.
My point is that none of that matters. Either my scientific claims are correct, or they are not. It’s not about me. Period. End of story.

When I was younger, for decades I was a Zen Buddhist. There is an important saying that Zen is not the moon, it is just the finger pointing at the moon. Complaints, arguments, and discussions about the finger miss the point – the subject of importance, the subject worthy of discussion, is the moon.
That’s the ultimate egalitarianism of science. Doesn’t matter if the person who made a scientific claim is a world-renowned expert or a semi-literate ditch digger. They are just the finger pointing at the moon. All that matters is, can the claim be falsified? What are the facts that support the claim? What are the facts that falsify the claim? Is the logic correct? Is the mathematics solidly based? Does it agree with other understandings?
Whether I lie (I don’t), or whether I have peer-reviewed publications (yes, three with a fourth currently in peer-review) is immaterial. All that matters is, are my ideas right or wrong? That’s why I put my ideas up here in the public square, so someone can falsify them. That’s the game called science. I make scientific claims, and you try to poke holes in my claims. Or you make scientific claims, and I try to poke holes in your claims. I play the game from both sides, falsifying the claims of others as well as publishing original and falsifiable claims of my own for people to attack.
So, attack is the very nature and essence of the science game. But it is supposed to be an attack on my SCIENTIFIC IDEAS. Not an attack on me, not an attack on my qualifications, not an attack on my occasionally rough cowboy nature, not an attack on my honesty, not an attack on what I have chosen to study. Truly, it’s not about me.
Having endured this kind of abuse for some years now, I’m taking another look at my expectations. In line with that, let me make some requests to the people who comment here:
1.  Talk about the science. Not about my qualifications. Not about what you imagine my motives might be. Not about my fancied truthiness content. Talk about the science. I am going to start pruning personal attacks out of my threads, so don’t be surprised if unpleasant accusations get red-lined. I will clearly mark when I do so and why. I despise invisible censorship as is practiced at RealClimate and the aptly Newspeak named “Open Mind”. There, ideas vanish without ever being seen, no one’s mind is open, and I’m an Unperson for my impertinent scientific questions and ideas.
2.  If you disagree with something I have said, QUOTE EXACTLY WHAT I SAID in your reply. I’m tired of defending myself against someone’s vague misunderstanding of my position. I’m going to stop guessing what people mean. If you want to have a discussion, quote my words, otherwise I may just skip over it. So many comments, so little time …
3.  Have the courage to sign your full true name to your ideas. Take ownership of your claims, stand behind your opinions. Anonymity encourages bad behavior. If I wasn’t so reluctant to “fix what ain’t broke” I’d be tempted to make using your real name a requirement on my threads, except for people with valid reasons (e.g. they’d lose promotion points where they work). I’d miss tallbloke and some others if they didn’t come forth, but I suspect that the signal-to-noise ratio would improve greatly. Whether it would still be as interesting to read is a separate question … in any case, no requirements, just an urgent plea for people to come out of the closet.
Additionally, as John Whitman said on another thread,
One of my several lines of reasoning criticizing anonymity revolves around ownership of ideas. If someone does not give their identity, it raises consequences in attributing ownership of their ideas and reckoning with plagiarism, misquoting, etc.
Another line of reasoning about why anonymity is controversial is dual personas. It leads to no restriction on one person representing themselves as many people, often with inconsistent views, personal specifics and professions. That is not intellectually honest.
So those are my three requests. Now, having said that this is not about me, enough people have questioned my fitness to comment on climate science that I would like to give an answer as to why I am qualified to do so. However, as with many things in my life, it’s kinda complicated, and involves a number of misunderstandings and coincidences. Pour yourself a cup of coffee, it’s a sea-dog’s tale of military madness.
The main strength that I bring to the analysis of the climate, curiously, is that I am a generalist. In a field like climate science, which is far broader than it is deep and encompasses a host of scientific disciplines, this is a huge advantage. How does one get to be a generalist? In my case, it was a combination of being a freak of nature, of growing up on a very remote and isolated cattle ranch surrounded by virgin forest, and of my curious interaction with the US Army.
I went to a two-room country grade school. There were 21 kids in eight grades, and seven of them were me and my three brothers and my three cousins. For the last four years of grade school, I was the only kid in my grade. I loved math and word play and puzzles of any kind, I sopped up knowledge and read everything I could lay hands on. In grade school, my folks hauled me off to Stanford University, where a guy who actually wore a white scientist coat gave me some kind of Sanford-Binet IQ test. They said my IQ was over 180. Freak of nature.
The grade school teacher said I could skip two grades. My mom said no, so the school let me go at my own speed. I finished eighth grade spelling in sixth grade. In seventh grade, I studied Spanish on my own. In eighth grade, the entire school district introduced Spanish education by TV. All the teachers in the county went to Spanish class one night a week so they could teach the kids and support the TV lessons with in-class training. My teacher couldn’t make it to the weekly teacher’s training, so they sent me instead. As a result, when I was in eighth grade, I was already teaching Spanish … I also completed a year of high school algebra while in grade school, which let me take college calculus in high school.
My mother was a single mom who raised four sons and ran a 280 acre cattle ranch. She was both a wise and a well-educated woman with a binge drinking problem, working for months without a drop and then going on a one-week bender. We never had much money. After some years of seeing other kids who always had better clothes and newer toys, one day I screwed up my courage and asked my mom if we were poor. “No,” she said angrily, “we’re not poor, and we’ll never be poor. Poor is a state of mind.” She sighed and relaxed, rubbed her work-hardened hands, looked wistfully at the summer sky, and added “I admit we’ve been broke for a while now, but we’re not poor …”
Growing up broke on a remote cattle ranch surrounded by wild forest means that if something has to get fixed, you have to fix it. If something has to get made, you have to make it. If you have to learn something to do that, you learn it. Growing up like that is a huge advantage to a future generalist. I came away with Leonardo da Vinci and Jim Bridger as my heroes, with the ability to do most practical things with my hands, and with the blind, wildly incorrect, but fervently-held belief that whatever needed to be done, somehow, someway, I could do it even if I had nothing but baling wire and a balky Crescent wrench.
In high school, I was the kid who carried a circular slide rule in his pocket and knew how to use all of the scales on both sides. Not a nerd, I was class president, but eccentric, obsessed by math and music and science. I ascribe my nose for bad numbers to the use of the slide rule. A slide rule doesn’t have a decimal point. So if you are say multiplying 3.14 times 118, you have to mentally estimate the size of the answer to decide where the decimal point goes. To this day, this sense of the right size for a number still serves me well. I often see a numerical value describing some natural phenomenon and correctly say “No way, that answer’s out of scale, something’s wrong”, even though I’m not familiar with the subject.
I started working as soon as I was old enough to legally work, the summer after my freshman year in high school.  That summer was spent was bucking hay, six ten-hour days a week, 35 cents an hour. I was fourteen. I was a Boy Scout. I got my Merit Badge for Weather, I found it fascinating. The next summer I worked as a bicycle messenger in San Francisco. The summer after that (1963) I went to a National Science Foundation special summer school for mathematicians in Oregon. We learned how to program computers. I was in heaven. I had read about computers, and I had heard about them, but to see one taking up an entire room, with its relays clicking and vacuum tubes humming, was my science fiction dream come true. And they let us write programs and run them! I was hooked, hooked bad, but of course there were no desktop computers or work in computing for me then. My last year of high school I worked a 20 hour week, running the photo-lathe and the Fairchild machine at the local newspaper past midnight into the small hours of the morning.
By this time, we had moved into town. My senior year of high school, mom ran away from home. I woke up one morning to find a thousand bucks and a note saying she wasn’t coming back, and could I take care of my two younger brothers. I ran the house, made sure they had food and did their studies, and with the invaluable help of my cousin, bless her, kept the home together for the rest of the school year. At the end of the school year I graduated as the class valedictorian, my brothers went to live with my dad, and when the money ran out I took a job as a cowboy on a cattle ranch up by the Oregon Border.
In the fall of 1964 I started college at the University of California at Berkeley, but I hated it. I lasted one year, and then I went to Alaska to seek my fortune. Instead, mostly I starved. I worked as a short order cook. I worked on a floating crab cannery. I worked emptying boats of rotten stinking crab. I worked longshoreman horsing 400 pound bales of pulp around a ship’s hold. And mostly I made my living singing folk songs and playing my guitar in saloons and coffeehouses. When it got cold I fled down the Alcan highway to Greenwich Village, New York in November, still singing. There, through the usual coincidences and misunderstandings, I lost everything I owned but my guitar and the clothes I had on. I hooked a ride to Coconut Grove in Florida because it was warm and I was freezing. I played music.
Then the Army sent me a draft notice. 1966, something about a little conflict in Southeast Asia, they wanted cannon fodder. But if I enlisted, I could choose my specialty. I enlisted and chose, ironically, weather observer. But I barely made it through Basic Training. Halfway through, I’d had enough. I didn’t go postal, I just quit taking orders. I calmly told the Sergeant that I couldn’t blindly take orders from someone I didn’t know, because they might order me to do something I didn’t believe in … his eyes bugged out and he took me to the Captain. I told him the same story. The Captain scratched his head, stuck me in front of a typewriter and gave me a stack of papers to deal with. I graduated with my company, but I never marched or trained with them again. They’d roll out at five-thirty AM for reveille. I got up at seven, walked over to the Company HQ, did company paperwork all day, filled out the forms the Captain hated to do, then went to the mess-hall and had dinner with the guys. I desperately wanted the Army to let me out. Instead, they just went around me. Go figure.
After Basic, they sent me to Weather Observer’s school in Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, near New York City. I learned how the Army categorizes clouds and what an “octa” is, how to use a wet bulb thermometer, weather theory, what a cold front looks like on a weather map and what it means, the usual stuff, and mostly, how to fill out US Army weather reporting forms. And I was going slowly nuts. They wouldn’t let us off base at all. So I stole a Class A pass from the Company safe.
The safe was in the Sergeant’s office. I timed his morning breaks for a couple of weeks. Never shorter than 8 minutes, and he left the safe open rather than relock it/unlock it. Easy.
With my stolen pass, every weekend I snuck out with my guitar and went into Greenwich Village, and played music in the clubs and hung out with the beatniks and the people I knew from the year before and slept in Central Park. For a couple Sundays, I was playing in a club on one side of the street, and the Loving Spoonful was playing on the other side. But at eight on Monday morning they were sleeping in, and I had to be back in my fatigues waiting for the other soldiers to catch up to the instructor’s slowly explained ideas about the weather. That split lifestyle went on for three months or so, half beatnik, half GI. I hated the Army. I constantly risked arrest for being AWOL or for my stolen pass. I developed an uncontrollable tic in my eye, it twitched like a demon, I couldn’t stop it. I was losing the plot, my dreams were of endless wandering in  strange landscapes, I found myself lashing out in random anger at strangers, or brooding in my room for hours. I was losing the plot.
Finally, one weekend I had gone up to Boston, and through the usual misunderstandings and coincidences I couldn’t make it back to the base in New Jersey on time. That meant I was headed for real trouble when I returned because I was AWOL, my Class A Pass was stolen. I was mondo depressed. I decided I had to get out. I ate a double fist-full of sleeping pills, and told someone to call the ambulance when I passed out. I didn’t care if I lived or died.
I passed out.
I woke up with the docs pumping the bad drugs out of my stomach in some emergency room and the cops questioning me about what happened. Then to counteract the bad drugs, they shot me full of good drugs.
I passed out.
I woke up firmly lashed to a bed. They told me I was in the Terminal Heart and Cancer Patient Ward of the Bethesda Naval Hospital.
OK.
I stayed lashed hand and foot to the bed for several days. Couldn’t feed myself. They fed me through a tube in my arm. I watched people die around me every day. They wouldn’t move the corpses during the day to avoid upsetting the others. So I’d wake up at two am, sleeping on my back because I can’t turn over, each arm is tied to the bedrail, and watch them carry out yet another body.
One day, a man with kind eyes walked through the ward. He told the orderly to untie me and bring me to his office. He looked at me and said “Son, you don’t belong in the military.”
I could have cried. I could have told him I knew that. I didn’t belong there in any sense. But I stayed silent. He said “This is a Navy hospital, I don’t even know why you’re here. The Army wants me to send you right back to your unit. I’m not comfortable with that. I’m putting you in the Bethesda Navy Mental Hospital.” I can’t remember if I offered to kiss his feet. After what I’d been through I wasn’t tracking all that well.
In 1966, the US Navy’s idea of what constituted a nuthouse might misleadingly be described as nautical and quaint. It was a quonset hut divided in half from floor to ceiling by a chain link fence. Half was for violent contestants, half for non-violent. Plus in the violent half was the rubber room, where they’d put you so you could bounce off the walls as much as you wanted. They stuck all us new contestants into the violent half, packed us full of Thorazine (a very heavy tranquilizer that they said was good drugs) and watched us nod out. Most of us were too sleepy to be attentive, much less violent, so we were let out into the other half of the nuthouse in a few days. There was no therapy. There was no radio, no books, just announcements from some Nurse Rached wannabe over the intercom. They gave us pajamas and a robe. There was nothing to do but watch crazy folks do their thing. And drool. Thorazine is great for drooling, I became an expert. I had been unfettered all my life, on the road, singing my songs, free as a bird. Now I was locked up in a distinctly un-gilded cage. My brain was regularly pumped full of happy juice. I was unhappy and depressed. I drooled and stared at the wall. A day on Thorazine with nothing to do lasts about a week.
After a month there moving in slow motion on good drugs, the Navy and the Army decided to ship me to Letterman Army Hospital in San Francisco. Nurse Rached read the orders and the names out over the intercom and had the orderlies bring out a bunch of stretchers. Instead of pills, they strapped us each to a stretcher and shot us each up with a mega-dose of Thorazine. Can’t have too much good drugs, I guess. Things got fuzzy. They stacked us like cordwood in a DC3, sliding the stretchers into special racks on the walls. I wanted to remember how close I was to the man on the stretcher above me. I found I could slide my hand on my chest in between us, but I couldn’t make a fist … and then the cotton wool closed in on my brain again. The trip took three days, with a different stop every night. They’d unstrap us, and we’d all stagger out like extras in a zombie movie. That first night after they unstrapped me, I staggered into the bathroom and sat down. I was bursting from the day on the plane. When I finished, I realized that although I’d remembered to drop my pajama bottoms, I hadn’t flipped up the back of my hospital robe. I’d sat on the flap instead and filled it with human waste. I looked down, shrugged, took my arms out of my robe, and walked out and left it right there. I was loopy, half crazed and half dazed, tranked to the max and locked up 24/7 with men as far off the rails as I was, what did I care? I just went to bed and said nothing to anyone, being crazy means never having to say you’re sorry. The next day they gave me a robe. Then they shot us up again, and again we flew all day. I remembered this time about the toilet and the robe. Finally, on the third day we staggered into the a base somewhere near Sacramento. They propped us all up in a bus, where we all flopped around like gumbies on the way to the Letterman nuthouse.
The Letterman Army nuthouse on the Presidio Army Base in San Francisco was in a building previously used as a holding prison for Federal criminals headed to Alcatraz. They took us into this prison and shot us up with a bunch of other good drugs. They propped us up against the wall to wait for dinner, and things got weird. First I started feeling stiff. Then my neck started to pull back, I couldn’t lower my chin. My shoulder started to arch back. Then my legs gave out and I fell on the floor. My back arched further and further back in an insane contortion. I was sure my back was going to snap, my muscles were seizing and bowing me backward. I was screaming and begging for help. Orderlies came and shot me full of yet more good drugs. I woke up groggy and tied to a bed in the violent ward, this was getting to be a theme. They explained slowly that I had spazzed out because they had given me bad drugs, but it was all OK because now they were giving me good drugs. Welcome to the Letterman nuthouse, where if you weren’t before, you will be.
I spent almost six months there, while the prelude to the “Summer of Love” was going on outside the prison doors. They let us out little by little. At first we could walk around the base for an hour with a visitor. After while, they gave us day passes. Me and my crazy friend Mel from the nuthouse would go to the Haight Ashbury. His girlfriend had a house there. His girlfriend also had a girlfriend, who became my girlfriend. After while, the Army gave us weekend passes out of prison. So every weekend, we’d take off our Army robe and pajamas that we wore all week, nutters don’t wear regular clothes. We’d put on freak clothes, paisley shirts and bell-bottom pants, we were unbearably cool. Except for our Army haircuts. We’d go with the ladies to the Haight, play music, get weird. We went to the First Human Be-In in Golden Gate Park and heard Timothy Leary rant, Allen Ginsberg emote, and the Grateful Dead and the Jefferson Airplane.
But every week we had to be back on the crazy ward by eight o’clock Monday morning. So we’d take LSD every Sunday night like clockwork, then turn ourselves back into the nuthouse with our eyes spinning like pinwheels on Monday morning, put on our robe and pajamas and watched the colors crawl up the wall and people’s faces change and melt … but it was worth it because it was more than a man could do to voluntarily return to that hole of lost humanity in a sane and sober state. You had to be crazy to go back there.
That split life went on for months. More schizophrenia on the half shell. The Army wasn’t much help. At the time they were mostly doing a lot of shock therapy. But they never did any followup. Me and Mel started doing what we could to help the people after shock therapy. I remember a guy who used to say “Well, they’re going to plug me into the wall today.” Then in the afternoon they’d take him out of the locked ward where we all lived, and bring him back with his memories scrubbed whiter than white, dump him on his bunk to stare at the wall, and walk away. Mel and I and some of the other walking wounded would pull out his wallet and show him the pictures. We’d tell him his name, and say he’d been in an accident. We didn’t say a war. We’d tell him that the young woman in the picture was his wife and the boy was his son. We’d tell he lived in Texas, and had been a soldier in a faraway war. That always seemed to surprise him, even without his memories he didn’t think of himself as a soldier, and I understood that perfectly.
After while we’d tell him that he’d been in a terrible situation in a distant country called Vietnam. We’d slowly work up to the fact that he was in a hospital. After while we’d let slip that it was not just any hospital, it was a nuthouse, because we’d learned by experience that he couldn’t cope with that information when he was straight out of the juice box. And so bit by bit he’d start remembering stuff, and for a while the balance was OK … but then after a week or so he’d start remembering too much stuff. He started remembering seeing and doing and enduring things no man should ever have to even witness, much less bear the shame and guilt of having seen and done and endured things beyond belief, and he’d start to shut down a bit at a time, until one day they’d take him off and plug him in again.
And they’d bring back a memory-free rag doll, and we’d start the process over again. Don’t get me wrong. The shock therapy helped him. We knew him from the day he came in from Vietnam. Before the first shock therapy, he was catatonic and never spoke one word. So I’m not opposed to the use of electroconvulsive therapy, it can work when nothing else does … but dang, the Army could’ve done better than leave his recovery to me and Mel …
Finally, after an eternity, four months in the nuthouse, they said I could go, and Mel could go too. We were going to escape without getting plugged into the wall, get discharged! The doctor signed our discharge papers. The Lieutenant and the Captain signed them. Everyone signed them right up to the Commanding General of the Presidio.
…
He said Mel would be discharged, but not me. I was to be sent to Ford Ord to be trained as a company clerk.
…
Go figure. I saluted the guy who gave me the orders, walked out the door, and went AWOL. I spent a couple of weeks snorting speed, in this case methadrine, and spending hours talking really, really fast to people about whatIshoulddo, shouldIgotoCanada, ormaybeturnmyselfin, noIshouldjuststayAWOLandhopeforthebest, I made up my mind dozens of times and unmade it again just as fast as my tongue could move.
Finally, after hours of listening to a record of Bob Dylan singing Memphis Blues Again, “Here I sit so patiently / Trying to find out what price / I have to pay to get out of / Going through all these things twice”, I took a massive dose of LSD and turned myself back in to Letterman Hospital to go through all these things twice. At the time I was dressed in Letterman hospital pajama bottoms and a tie-dyed shirt. The doctors just shook their heads and shot me full of happy juice, once again it appeared I was off bad drugs and on good drugs. I woke up lashed down on a bunk in the locked ward, this was getting kind of old. No weekend passes for the bad AWOL boy this time. In a couple weeks they decided I needed work therapy.
So I was put to work in a small room with three black guys wearing pajamas and robes like me but all styled out with colorful do-rags around their heads. All day long they listened to the blackest of Oakland radio stations, “KDIA Lucky Thirteen”. They were great, they welcomed me as one of their own, as only fellow lunatics can. We ironed iron-on patches onto teeny holes in operating room sheets all day long, all of us buzzed on Thorazine, all of us gently rocking and singing along with James Brown and the Shirelles and Etta James and Motown and all things black … great music education for your average white boy. Plus I got to enjoy just hanging with the brothers and listening to and joining in with their endless jive and good spirits, bizarrely, a wonderful time.
Plus I learned how to iron patches on operating room sheets at a rate of knots, what’s not to like?
Finally, nine months after taking a double handful of sleeping pills in Boston and not really caring if I lived or died, having slipped between the Scylla of being plugged into the wall and the Charybdis of being sent back to the Army, and in a state both less crazy and more crazy than when I went entered the nuthouse, they let me go. I had outlasted them. I was given an Honorable Discharge as being “Unfit for Military Service” … like I say, I could have saved them a lot of work, I knew that from the start.
So I was free, finally free, out of prison free, no walls free, living in San Francisco in 1967 free. No more unbreakable steel bars dividing the sky into a demented solitaire tic-tac-toe game. No more grilles and locks on the door. No ironing tiny patches on sheets for eight hours a day, only to return to a locked ward full of fellow sufferers after work. No more waking up once again lashed to the damn bed. I moved in with my girlfriend. She was dancing in a topless bar on Broadway. I was twenty years old, I couldn’t even go into the bar to watch her dance … but I was free, and I swore a very big swear to unknown deities that I would remain that way.
And finally, to return to the theme, somewhere in the first months after I got out from behind bars, I made some rules of thumb for myself that eventually turned me into a generalist. One was that my motto would be “Retire Early … And Often”. Since then I’ve never been unemployed. Instead, I’ve worked a while and then retired until the money ran out. Being retired is very different from being unemployed. It’s worry-free.
Another rule of thumb I took up was that given a choice between something I had done and something I had not done, I would always do the thing undone.
Another was that if I was offered security or adventure, I’d choose adventure. And curiously, that has led to perfect security.
Finally, I swore that I wouldn’t take any more jobs unless they had a fixed ending date. I was done with serving indeterminate sentences. The end of the season, the completion of the house, the end of the harvest, I swore not to be bound by unending work as I had been bound in the nuthouse, with no known end date in sight. Some prisoners in WWII German concentration camps said worse than the cold, worse than the hunger and the beatings, the worst thing was the uncertainty of whether they’d ever get out. I can see why. I had faced that uncertainty in a cold concrete building with bars on the windows for half a year, seeing men rotting away in a Thorazine daze in the Letterman nuthouse, sometimes they’d been there for years, watching some get shipped off to a more permanent lifelong nuthouse, not knowing if I would get out or if I’d get plugged into the wall.
Yes, I’d take a job, but this time I’d know when my sentence would be up, and I’d be waiting for that day so I could retire again.
I have mostly followed those guidelines for the rest of my life. Since then I have worked at dozens of different jobs and trades around the world. I make as much money as I can as fast as I can until the bell rings, then I retire. I stay retired until I get called out of retirement by a great job offer. Or by an empty stomach. I have worked on all the continents but Antarctica. I lived on tropical South Pacific islands for seventeen years. I have made money by making and selling jewelry, as a commercial fisherman from LA to Alaska, as a psychotherapist, a refrigeration technician, a well driller, an auto mechanic, a computer programmer, a graphic artist, a construction manager on multi-million dollar projects, a sailboat deliveryman, a maker of stained-glass art, a project and program designer for USAID and the Peace Corps, a shipyard manager on a hundred acre remote island, an international renewable-energy trainer, a maker of fine custom cabinets, a multi-country health program manager, the Chief Financial Officer of a company with $40 million in annual sales, the Service Manager for an Apple Macintosh dealer, a high-end home builder, a sport salmon fishing guide on the Kenai River in Alaska, and a bunch more. I’m a surfer, a sailor, and a diver, with Open Water II and Rescue Diver tickets and an inshore Coast Guard Skipper’s License. I have my Ham Radio license, Hotel 44 Whiskey Echo.
All of this has given me all of the tools needed to work in climate science. I understand tropical weather intimately because I’ve spent years observing it. I know the vertical temperature structure of the ocean’s nocturnal overturning because I’ve experienced it scuba diving at night down under the surface. I understand climate as a heat engine because I’ve dealt with heat engines and refrigerators and their mathematical analysis and concepts for years. I’ve watched underwater damage to coral reefs from bleaching as it happened, and I’ve watched them recover. I understand the computer models because I never stopped programming after 1963. I have spent hundreds and hundreds of hours writing all kinds of programs, including models of physical and business systems. I speak a half-dozen computer languages fluently, and can read and write slowly in another half-dozen. I have also seen what the lack of inexpensive energy does to the desperately poor, I’ve shared their tables and listened to their stories. I know the vagaries of Arctic weather, not from books, but because I fished commercially in the Bering Sea and froze my guitar in Anchorage. I am not an expert in chemistry, or physics, or atmospheric dynamics, or oceanography, or computer models, or biology, or mathematics, or arctic ecosystems, I am self-taught in all of them. But I have a good solid practical working knowledge of every one of them, I have a deep understanding of various aspects of a number of them, and I have the ability to use the lessons from one field in another.
I became interested in climate science in the 1990s. My nose for numbers said that Hansen’s claims were way out of line. Here was my first and admittedly simple climate calculation. I figured half a kilowatt per square metre average global downwelling radiation (long-wave plus short-wave). People said doubling CO2 might be 4 watts per square metre. That’s less than 1%, and in a huge, ponderous, chaotic, constantly changing climate, my bad number detector said no way that a 1% variation in forcing would knock the Earth’s climate off the rails. I reckoned if it were that delicately balanced, it would have done the Humpty Dumpty long ago.
So I started reading the various climate science studies, but idly, as they came by, just to keep in touch with the field. The real change came in 1995, when we (me + wife + four year old daughter) moved off our houseboat in Fiji and back to the US, where I could connect to the internet … and opening the internet to a mathematically minded fact junkie like me was a heady drug. Suddenly, I could actually read the papers and go get the data and see what was going on. I wasn’t chained to other peoples’ opinions of the science, I could run the numbers myself.
Of course, all of this required an immense amount of study. But I’m real good at doing my homework. I once took a job to assemble, install, charge, and test a blast freezer on a sailboat in Fiji. I was hired along with my buddy who was a welder, he did the tricky soldering work, and taught me to do it. At the time, I couldn’t have told you how a refrigerator worked, but I knew the job wouldn’t start for two months. So I bought a college refrigeration textbook and ate, breathed, and slept with that sucker. At the end of one month I could recite it backwards. The second month I bought a refrigeration technician’s textbook, bought some gauges and tanks of Freon and learned the practical end of the game.
At the end of two months, I figured I could build a refrigerator from scratch … which was fortunate, since what was supposed to be a full blast freezer kit with all the parts turned out to be a half kit, and Fiji is short on refrigeration parts. In the event, we got it built like we built things on the ranch, simply because I had to, so I figured out how to. The blast freezer worked perfectly, the wind came off it at minus 50 degrees F, about minus 46°C. It turned out to be an alchemical freezer, because when it was completed it magically transmuted a half-dozen one-litre bottles of vodka chilled to -40° (C or F, your choice) into a two-day Fijian freezer boat party that led to a couple of divorces, one marriage, headaches all around, and a wallet or two that went swimming. I was so drunk I went to sleep on a nice soft pile of rope, and woke up in pain to realize I was sleeping on the anchor chain … but I digress.
That is the kind of intensity I brought to my investigation of climate science in the nineties as once again I began yet another field of study. I don’t know how many this makes for me, I’ve done it for most new jobs, but this has been an obsession. I have spent literally thousands of hours learning about how the GCMs work and don’t work, about how the statistics of non-normal datasets differ from those of normal datasets, why polar albedo is less important than tropical albedo, how many populations of polar bears there are and what their populations are really doing (mostly increasing), how to program in R, the list never ends. The beauty of climate science is that it is a new science, there is still so much to learn, the opportunity to find out new things beckons because so much is unknown, I never get bored, and so I continue to study.
That’s why I think I am qualified to comment on climate science. I am one of a dying breed with a long and proud history and tradition, a self-educated amateur scientist. As the root of the word “amateur” suggests, an amateur scientist is someone who investigates things scientifically for love (Latin amare) rather than for money … which is fortunate, considering my profits on the venture to date.
I am also one of the few amateur scientists who has published anything peer-reviewed in Nature Magazine in many years. Yes, it is a humble “Brief Communications Arising”. But it was assuredly peer-reviewed, and strictly reviewed.
I also have published three pieces in Energy & Environment, the journal AGW supporters love to hate and slander because it dares to publish peer-reviewed non-AGW supporting science, a disgraceful flouting of wanton public heresy. Two of those three pieces were peer-reviewed, and one was an opinion piece. And yes, E&E has published some peer-reviewed stuff that has turned out to be junk … quite unlike say Science or Nature Magazine …
However, at the end of the day all of that is nothing but stories to tell around a campfire. None of it means anything about whether a claim of mine is true or false. I bring immense practical experience and thousands of hours of study and a very quick mind to the problem, and despite that I can be not just wrong, but stupidly wrong, embarrassingly wrong, make me say very bad words wrong. Because my hours of study mean nothing. My experience means nothing. It truly is not about me, the only thing that counts is whether my ideas can stand the test of time or not.
Anyhow, that’s my story of how I became a generalist, or at least a small and not real pretty part of it, it got more interesting after that. I tell it to encourage everyone to please cut me (and everyone who dares to post their ideas for public attack) some slack regarding the personal attacks. As my story shows, some of us have studied extensively and thought long and hard about the subjects in question even if we may not have credentials and diplomas and official positions. As my story also shows, you may not have a clue what a man knows and what he has done in his life and what he can do and what drives him to do it. Leave all of that speculation at home.
So those are my requests. Talk about the science, quote my words if you disagree with them, sign your work, and keep fighting the good scientific fight.
My regards to everyone, and to misquote Willy Nelson, “Mommas, don’t let your babies grow up to be generalists” …

[UPDATE] I’d like to thank Claude for raising an issue that I actually thought would have come up long before.
Claude Harvey says:
March 1, 2011 at 12:03 am
Willis,
Now that we’ve been treated to a litany of idolatrous responses to your personal story, let us hope that your clear analysis and “ideas” are, indeed, not confused with “who you are”. Your romanticized account of your stint in the military’s “Med-2″ program is the classic account of a fellow who “couldn’t (or, according to your account, wouldn’t) do the time for which he’d contracted”.
I too joined the military at a tender age and I too was appalled at having to “tuck it in” and take orders from lesser (in my opinion) mortals than myself. The difference between us is that I did what I had agreed to do and you did not. Twist and turn it any way you like, that is not a very admirable bottom line and it reflects an “elitist” attitude (you were ever so too smart for such mundane endeavors) that I find very unattractive.
I continue to admire your work, but I do not admire certain aspects of your history.
Claude, thanks for your comments. Here’s the problem. Let’s try looking at it from the other side.
What we didn’t understand at the time, and what many don’t understand now, is that to the Vietnamese it was always a war of independence. The Chinese, and then the French, then the Japanese, then the French again, the Vietnamese fought these foreign invaders all in succession. And when like fools and against the advice of De Gaulle the Americans invaded, it was like take a number, here’s the latest contestant.
Here is a stunning fact. In 1963, when from the Vietnamese perspective America joined the endless parade of invading countries, Ho Chi Minh was already 73 years old. He had been fighting to throw first one invader, then another, then another out of his country for over fifty years before the first American soldier came to his country, and he gladly went forward with his unending war of independence..
Fifty years! Fifty years of endless wars, and he used everything he’d learned in his war against the Americans. We totally misunderstood. We thought we were fighting Communism. We thought there was a civil war, north against south. It was nothing of the sort. By the time we stuck our hands in the buzz-saw, it was a fifty-year war of independence against country after country after country.
Ho Chi Minh knew that he was the good guy, fighting a lifelong fight against anyone trying to invade his country. We had no idea what we were up against. Most folks didn’t dream that we were the bad guys, the invaders.
And to return to my own story, I see what I did as escaping, in any way I could, from a lethally misdirected war. I see what you did as knuckling under to the tyrants who wanted to use you for cannon fodder in that unjust war.
Consider it in your own words:
“Twist and turn it any way you like”, knuckling under to thugs and going thousands of miles to kill people who just wanted you out of their country, merely so Claude’s precious ‘word’ can be true, “is not a very admirable bottom line”.
You see the problem? It’s far from a simple question. Honoring your word is important to you, just as it is to me. We agree. You think that you should honor the word you gave when you joined the military, that you keeping your word on that is more important than the life of some yellow-skinned guy halfway around the world fighting to drive you out of his homeland. Me, not so much … we disagree.
Now, obviously, this is something on which reasonable men can and do disagree. It is not a simple question, there’s no right answer. I wrestled with it myself, as did you.
But for you to come in and try to bust me because I didn’t make the choice you made, and then to claim that you have the moral high ground here?
Sorry … in that war, there was no moral high ground. There was no honorable path, no middle road. A friend of mine was a Captain in the Army who was going to be a lifer. He was stationed in Korea. He took leave to go to see what was happening in Vietnam because he was slated to be sent there. Having seen it, he resigned his commission, an option I did not have, so he would not have to participate in what he saw (and still sees) as the wrong war in the wrong place at the wrong time against the wrong people for the wrong reasons … you gonna tell us that he should have kept his word and not resigned and happily gone to “kill gooks” because LBJ said so? Because I’d advise against you telling him that, since he actually is a pretty noble and ethical warrior, and he won’t be impressed …
I have friends that made the decision you made. But they don’t put on your airs. They’re not like you, insulting people by claiming that it was some moral crusade and that they made the right decision. They don’t blame me for the path I took, nor do I blame them (or you) for taking the path you took. They know what I know. Nobody came out of the Vietnam War unwounded, there were no right decisions. Nobody made the “moral choice” about Vietnam, Claude. Not you, not JFK, and certainly not me … the most moral act I’ve seen in the context of Vietnam was my friend resigning his commission.

"Lead is a toxic metal and for that reason it has been removed from petrol, paints and drinking water pipes. But it remains popular in the manufacture of bullets and shot for game hunting and target shooting, despite the effects it can have on wildlife and the risks it could have to human health. In the UK, lead shot has long since been outlawed for use over wetlands, as grain-eating ducks and geese would mistake the small shot for seeds and grit. Yet it is still used throughout the countryside for other forms of hunting. While research from within the UK is scarce, evidence from elsewhere suggests that birds who feed on grains over fields can collect and eat this lead shot. Also, predators and scavenger species such as crows and raptors can accumulate lead and die thanks to feeding on lead ingested by their prey, or game that was shot but not recovered. This, in turn, harms recovering populations of birds of prey such as red kites. To put this in perspective, if a commercial shooting estate were to offer a single day hunting pheasant with an expected bag of 200 birds and the hunters were half decent shots, they might expect a 1:3 kill to cartridge ratio. Using a standard game load of 32 grams of No. 5 lead shot, each cartridge containing around 248 pellets, that represents just over 25kg of lead shot. In the UK upwards of 30m game birds are released each year, with about half of these being shot and bagged and some being wounded and lost or die from other causes. While we could argue about how best to estimate the amount of lead spread in the UK countryside – it is clear that it’s a lot. Some conservation organisations, along with campaigners like Chris Packham and Mark Avery, have lead shot in their sight. With evidence that some commercial hunters are not sticking to the current laws the pressure has been building on shooting organisations to rise to the challenge. Unfortunately this has not happened, and instead the call for a ban on lead ammunition has been received with scepticism and as a general attack on shooting and hunting. Some of this scepticism is borne out of a view that UK-based hunting is unique, with a focus on old “sporting guns” and “driven” pheasants – a form of collective hunting where some hunters flush birds with dogs forward to waiting guns. There is a a belief that non-lead shot is not a fit replacement for this style of hunting, and while ballistic tests suggest otherwise it could just be people dont want to change and like using old guns that cannot be used with modern shot ammunition.  The organisations who represent UK hunters and shooters could not be more clear that they support the status quo of no further regulation. Fair enough, perhaps, but it does point to a lack of belief in what is now a robust body of evidence of lead impacts on wildlife. However, a new study published in the British Ecological Society journal People & Nature does not focus on the views of hunting and conservation organisations, or vocal personalities on social media. Instead, it uses quantitative social sciences to examine the diversity of experiences and views on hunting ammunition among UK hunters.  Across that diversity, two statistically significant groups emerged. The first is the “status quo” group, who the hunting organisations champion. This group is reluctant to switch, is not convinced about the suitability of lead-shot alternatives and is not convinced by the science that birds suffer and die from spent shotgun ammunition.  The second group was “open to change”, and some conservation organisations and activists would have you believe this group does not exist. This group accepted that lead is likely to poison wild birds and wildlife, were very happy to use non-lead ammunition and importantly did not feel that any phase-out of lead hunting ammunition would lead to the demise of shooting and hunting in the UK. The two groups did agree on a few things, including that lead is indeed toxic, which means there appears to be more scope to resolve the conflict than the recent breakdown of government-convened talks would have us believe. Questions remain over what role the “open to change” group and hunting organisations could play in reaching out to the “status quo” to achieve a future with less lead and more respect for quarry species. In the meantime this new research is to be welcomed for taking a less polemic bridge-building approach to resolving conflicts in the British countryside."

O me miserum. Doom and gloom to start the day yesterday put me in a mood to feel thoroughly miserable. It was pouring with rain and we had just had our backsides handed to us on a plate at Chester-le-Street. They might as well have taken me on tour instead of Sodhi or Blundell; at least I could have caught up with some university mates.



Then when I paid attention to the state of the world New Zealand style, it’s muppets to the left, muppets to the right. How much longer do we have to put up with sitting idly by watching a bunch of incompetents run the country into the ground? This lot couldn’t run a bath. They can’t make a decision about anything and when they try, all we get is a committee, a report or we’ll have to take advice from the experts (sic) about that. Anything to kick the can down the road. 



Yesterday the Can Kicker in Chief managed a stellar answer to a simple meaningless question even by her own high standards of prevarication. She said she would not be averse to the country declaring a climate emergency. Not that she will, not that she won’t; but just not averse. I am not going to make a decision on even a virtue-signalling piece of nonsense but I won’t stand in the way of my fellow muppets who might…or might not.



And we have more muppets wrecking the economy. Business confidence is falling like a stone. Then there is an ex-union leader who has failed to win an electoral seat on multiple occasions slagging off Google calling them ‘evil’. They may well be, but, when you are Minister of Justice, what about the concept of innocent until proven guilty? **There are times when it is diplomatic, nay essential when you hold public office, to keep your mouth shut.** But he wouldn’t know the first thing about responsibility in public office, would he?



People in (very minor) public office keeping stumm? I give you a list MP who tells porkies in her CV and who has forgotten that when sitting on the green benches you should really stop being a student activist. Then there is a woman whose place in parliament is equally tenuous who thinks it is important that we popularise the most vulgar of swear words. Then there is our minister of housing whose only qualification for her portfolio is that she lives in a house. And on and on and on it goes.



All this because we have a system that allows the party of a septuagenarian (who also currently is unable to secure an electorate seat) to decide that we have to put up with these clowns as an elected government. Even worse, he and his party will probably be in a position to do it again.



I know this contributes nothing positive in the way of trying to do something about the parlous state in which we find ourselves, but I am not in the mood to feel anything but despondent.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThis December for much of Germany and Central Europe has been a pretty cold month so far, with lots of snow and cold weather. At least that was the case until this past weekend when a warm southerly air mass swept across Germany and elevated temperatures well above normal, just in time for Christmas.

Yesterday, Christmas Eve, the mercury climbed to 18.9 °C in Freiberg in southern Germany – a new national record for the date. Spiegel writes that it was even warmer in Munich – but unofficially:
The thermometer at one measuring station at the university showed 20.7 °C. However, the German Weather Service (DWD) pointed out on Tuesday that this was not one of its official measurement stations. The reading measured in Munich will not be included in the official statistics of the DWD.”
Yet that didn’t stop the media from running with the reading as if it were an official record. Everywhere they reported the unofficial 20.7°C reading as a new record. For example online weekly Die Zeit here reported the 20.7°C reading as if it had been an official high (and good enough to qualify for the Die Zeit “Science” section):
With 20.7°C, a national temperature record high for Christmas Eve was measured since the beginning of the instrumental record.”
Indeed it would be interesting if a reader photographed that unofficial university station. Who knows what heat sources may be nearby. And I guess the media think that the German Weather Service can be just ignored nowadays.

Once again Die Zeit demonstrates an overzealous tendency of not checking the facts before printing, read here. No matter, the unofficial reading, which had never been accepted by the German Weather Service, was good enough for the broader German mainstream media to declare as the new record – and yet another sign of man-made climate change.
Record cold in Russia claims over 120 lives
Not surprisingly, much of the media refuses to report on the record cold gripping Russia, Siberia and large swaths of Asia, i.e. an area thousands of times larger than the isolated southern regions of Germany.
Spiegel, however, covers the massive northern hemisperic cold here, with an online piece titled: “Record cold in Russia claims more than 120 lives”. Read latest Russian cold here!
To be fair, Die Zeit reports on the record cold in Russia, but buries the story in the “Weather” section. Real propaganda meisters they are. I had to use their “search” function to find it.
At Die Zeit, weeks of record cold over a large swath of the northern hemisphere, with hundreds of lives lost, is less newsworthy than one unofficial record warm day in the city of Munich.

From California Institute of Technology:
Warm water causes extra-cold winters in northeastern North America and northeastern Asia
This map shows sea‑surface temperatures averaged over eight days in September 2001, as measured by NASA's Terra satellite. Dark red represents warm water (32 degrees Celsius) and purple is cold (‑2 degrees Celsius). The Gulf Stream can be seen as the orange strip extending from the eastern U.S. toward the Atlantic.

PASADENA, Calif.—If you’re sitting on a bench  in New York City’s Central Park in winter, you’re probably freezing.  After all, the average temperature in January is 32 degrees Fahrenheit.  But if you were just across the pond in Porto, Portugal, which shares  New York’s latitude, you’d be much warmer—the average temperature is a  balmy 48 degrees Fahrenheit.
Throughout northern Europe, average winter temperatures are at least  10 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than similar latitudes on the northeastern  coast of the United States and the eastern coast of Canada. The same  phenomenon happens over the Pacific, where winters on the northeastern  coast of Asia are colder than in the Pacific Northwest.
Researchers at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) have  now found a mechanism that helps explain these chillier winters—and the  culprit is warm water off the eastern coasts of these continents.

“These warm ocean waters off the eastern coast actually make it cold  in winter—it’s counterintuitive,” says Tapio Schneider, the Frank J.  Gilloon Professor of Environmental Science and Engineering.
Schneider and Yohai Kaspi, a postdoctoral fellow at Caltech,  describe their work in a paper published in the March 31 issue of the  journal Nature.
Using computer simulations of the atmosphere, the researchers found  that the warm water off an eastern coast will heat the air above it and  lead to the formation of atmospheric waves, drawing cold air from the  northern polar region. The cold air forms a plume just to the west of  the warm water. In the case of the Atlantic Ocean, this means the frigid  air ends up right over the northeastern United States and eastern  Canada.
For decades, the conventional explanation for the cross-oceanic  temperature difference was that the Gulf Stream delivers warm water from  the Gulf of Mexico to northern Europe. But in 2002, research showed  that ocean currents aren’t capable of transporting that much heat,  instead contributing only up to 10 percent of the warming.
This image, taken by NASA's Terra satellite in March 2003, shows a much colder North America than Europe‑‑even at equal latitudes. White represents areas with more than 50 percent snow cover. NASA's Aqua satellite also measured water temperatures. Water between 0 and ‑15 degrees Celsius is in pink, while water between ‑15 and ‑28 degrees Celsius is in purple.

Kaspi’s and Schneider’s work reveals a mechanism that helps create a  temperature contrast not by warming Europe, but by cooling the eastern  United States. Surprisingly, it’s the Gulf Stream that causes this  cooling.
In the northern hemisphere, the subtropical ocean currents circulate  in a clockwise direction, bringing an influx of warm water from low  latitudes into the western part of the ocean. These warm waters heat the  air above it.
“It’s not that the warm Gulf Stream waters substantially heat up  Europe,” Kaspi says. “But the existence of the Gulf Stream near the U.S.  coast is causing the cooling of the northeastern United States.”
The researchers’ computer model simulates a simplified,  ocean-covered Earth with a warm region to mimic the coastal reservoir of  warm water in the Gulf Stream. The simulations show that such a warm  spot produces so-called Rossby waves.
Generally speaking, Rossby waves are large atmospheric waves—with  wavelengths that stretch for more than 1,000 miles. They form when the  path of moving air is deflected due to Earth’s rotation, a phenomenon  known as the Coriolis effect. In a way similar to how gravity is the  force that produces water waves on the surface of a pond, the Coriolis  force is responsible for Rossby waves.
In the simulations, the warm water produces stationary Rossby waves,  in which the peaks and valleys of the waves don’t move, but the waves  still transfer energy. In the northern hemisphere, the stationary Rossby  waves cause air to circulate in a clockwise direction just to the west  of the warm region. To the east of the warm region, the air swirls in  the counterclockwise direction. These motions draw in cold air from the  north, balancing the heating over the warm ocean waters.
To gain insight into the mechanisms that control the atmospheric  dynamics, the researchers speed up Earth’s rotation in the simulations.  In those cases, the plume of cold air gets bigger—which is consistent  with it being a stationary Rossby-wave plume. Most other atmospheric  features would get smaller if the planet were to spin faster.
Although it’s long been known that a heat source could produce  Rossby waves, which can then form plumes, this is the first time anyone  has shown how the mechanism causes cooling that extends west of the heat  source. According to the researchers, the cooling effect could account  for 30 to 50 percent of the temperature difference across oceans.
This process also explains why the cold region is just as big for  both North America and Asia, despite the continents being so different  in topography and size. The Rossby-wave induced cooling depends on  heating air over warm ocean water. Since the warm currents along western  ocean boundaries in both the Pacific and Atlantic are similar, the  resulting cold region to their west would be similar as well.
The next step, Schneider says, is to build simulations that more  realistically reflect what happens on Earth. Future simulations would  incorporate more complex features like continents and cloud feedbacks.

"**Non-urgent orthopaedic surgery has been suspended at the Isle of Man's main hospital after a ""higher than average"" rise in winter hospital admissions, the health minister has said.**
The ""regrettable"" step was taken to ensure there was capacity at Noble's Hospital to cope with winter demand along with a possible rise in Covid-19 patients, David Ashford said.
Daily admissions are currently 50% higher than the same period in 2019.
Emergency operations will continue.
Mr Ashford said the current rise in admissions was the result of a ""mix of acute care needs"" and there was ""no one significant single cause"".
Current pressures on UK hospitals as a result of the pandemic has led to changes to the management of care on the island, contributing to the rise in local admissions.
A contingency plan has already been put in place to further reconfigure the hospital if there was a resurgence of Covid-19 on the island in future.
Mr Ashford said it was ""very regrettable"" operations had been cancelled and he hoped the suspension was very temporary, but added that there was a need to ""act now... to ensure we are well prepared"".

"Can the world’s greatest coral reef system be rescued from the rapid march of the climate crisis? With global temperatures already about 1C higher than pre-industrial levels, Queensland’s Great Barrier Reef has been through three mass bleaching events in only five years.  Corals are dying and the system is changing rapidly as temperatures keep going up and greenhouse gases keep accumulating in the atmosphere. Earlier this week, the Australian government revealed a $150m research and development program to build the reef’s resilience to future warming. Ken Anthony, a principal research scientist at the Australian Institute of Marine Science, said: “It’s a bit like the Apollo 11 mission. It really is on that scale. We have to be able to look Australians in the eye in in 10 years’ time and say that in the time we had, we did our best.” On its own, the project – called the Reef Restoration and Adaptation Program – is a clear signal that scientists now know cutting greenhouse gas emissions will not be enough to sustain a vibrant reef. It’s time for intervention at a scale never seen before, scientists say, and they’re in a race against time to find enough solutions before climate change bites even harder. Some 43 concepts are being backed under the plan, from futuristic cloud brightening to using concrete blocks to stabilise damaged reefs. The program has split the concepts into seven groups and scientists say none of them will be enough in isolation – it’s more likely that a combination deployed at different scales will give the reef the best chance. These seven categories fall broadly into three approaches: Shading and cooling reefs to cut sunlight or lower ocean temperatures; Stabilising and rebuilding reef structures damaged from bleaching, cyclones or ocean acidification; Helping corals adapt to warmer temperatures and then moving their larvae around en masse. So what’s being planned, and could these approaches really buy the reef enough time? In early March, Daniel Harrison, a biological oceanographer at Southern Cross University, led a trial of equipment that sprays trillions of nano-sized salt crystals into the air. The idea is the salt crystals reach existing low-level clouds and, because of their tiny size, encourage the formation of smaller cloud droplets that reflect more sunlight than larger droplets. The process mirrors what happens over the oceans every day as winds carry salty ocean spray into the air to help form clouds. Harrison is leading a project to try to scale-up the trial to see if clouds over hundreds of kilometres could be brightened. If this was possible, the brightening effect could slightly lower ocean temperatures below – perhaps keeping corals just cool enough to prevent them from bleaching. Such a system could be turned on and off quickly, and could be deployed when weather forecasts and models show that corals are under dangerous levels of heat stress. Harrison, who is leading the cooling and shading efforts under the government program, says: “It’s a combination of light and temperature that causes corals to bleach. “We are pursuing the things that are really big in scale, but also looking at small scale actions that could support outcomes on a local level at high value reef sites.” Other methods under this “shading and cooling” category include machines to create artificial low-hanging sea fog that could provide shade over smaller areas. Researchers are also looking at ultra-thin reflective films that could temporarily cut the sunlight over small areas. “This is a race against time,” he said. “If we can go really hard on emissions and meet or beat the Paris [climate] targets, then these interventions have the potential to help get the reef to a sustainable future – but only under that very aggressive emissions reduction scenario.” Anyone who has walked around an ancient Roman city will have seen restorers working behind steel props and scaffolding that hold up what’s left of a once majestic temple or amphitheatre. Coral bleaching and cyclones can weaken the structure of reefs, known as the substrate. Scientists think that if reefs could be stabilised, it might give other methods a chance to take hold and restore individual reefs. There are question marks over the economics of deploying mesh or 3D printed frames at scale, but the restoration programs suggest there could be small-scale deployments that could help reefs recover. Removing natural rubble around reefs could also help create space for new corals to grow, and is another area under investigation. Modelling for the program found these approaches tended to only be cost effective if emissions in the future were very low. But they could still help at smaller scales. Anthony says if temperatures stay below 2C “then there is so much we can do” across all the approaches. “It’s both daunting to look at the challenge ahead, but also we know we have to come up with a plan,” he says. “At 3C the reef will look very different – it would be a sad story, but you still wouldn’t give up.” Prof Peter Harrison, at Southern Cross University, is a global expert on how coals reproduce and was among the first to discover their mass spawning on just a few nights of the year after full moons. “It’s like an underwater snowstorm and billions of eggs and sperm get released,” he says. One approach under development is to find ways to capture larvae during natural spawning and then move them in “slicks” and drop them in places that need help to recover. Harrison says there is always masses of excess coral larvae that would float away or be eaten and, before the impacts of climate change, “it didn’t matter if 99% [of the larvae] drifted away or got eaten fish, because there were so many of them.” “Because the production of larvae has been so dramatically impacted because of the mass bleaching, we are now looking to see how we could use what we know about coral reproduction and more effectively transfer them onto damaged reef systems.” Harrison says methods being researched under the new program include scaling up floating ocean pools to transfer coral larvae, or eggs and sperm raised in aquaculture ponds, onto reefs. Corals get much of their colour and nutrients from the symbiotic relationship they have with special algae. Harrison says that some corals are more heat tolerant than others, and the same goes for the algae. Combining heat tolerant algae and heat tolerant corals, and then producing more heat tolerant larvae, could give reefs “more scope for growth under warming conditions”. “We think we can get an increased tolerance [of corals] of just a few degrees. Ultimately, unless the political leadership round the world enables a realistic approach to managing greenhouse gas emissions and bringing the rate of climate change under control, the system will become so overwhelmed we won’t be able to use these corals. “We are buying time to help coral species to evolve and adapt and buy enough time to get some real action on climate change. There’s a large group of people around me who feel we can’t wait for action. We have to work out what we can do now.”"

What are the police paid to do? An illegal roadblock is installed and the police leave it in place. A senior citizen removes it to go about his lawful pursuits and the protestors call the police. Madness!



A Redfield retiree ripped down an Extinction Rebellion blockade so he could drive through.



Brian Salt, 73, usually drops his friend Lynne Mattin off for her evening cleaning shifts at a barristers’ chambers in Broad Street without trouble.



But this week he encountered a road-block on Newgate when trying to drive his camper van to Ms Mattin’s workplace at 5.40pm.



Extinction Rebellion (XR) has closed the route with a banner and signs each day this week as part of a bid to raise awareness of the ‘climate emergency’.



Mr Salt says activists have repeatedly refused to let him pass each evening, meaning Ms Mattin, 65, has had to walk about a quarter of a mile to work.



“She was in tears from the pain,” Mr Salt said. “She has a false knee and she can’t walk long distances.



“I tried to tell them this but they didn’t listen. It’s disgusting. Any sympathy people might have had for the protesters is gone.”



He says things have “turned nasty” each time he has tried to get through, so he decided to “have a bit of fun” just before 8pm yesterday (July 17).



Mr Salt continued: “I tried to do it nicely and it didn’t work. So when I went back to collect Lynne after her shift, I ripped down the banner and moved the signs.”



He laughed as he recalled: “They were shouting, ‘Call the police, call the police.’ I told them it wasn’t a legal road closure.



“I will repeat it the next time I drive Lynne to work. I am quite willing to get arrested. I am open about it.”



Avon and Somerset Constabulary and Extinction Rebellion have been approached for comment.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThis year’s Elevate Festival is now taking place in Graz, Austria from (24 – 28 October) and features a program of discussions, lectures and screenings designed to bring attention to social, environmental and political issues.

Rahmstorf joins Occupy Wall Street, Noam Chomsky and eco-genocide lawyer Polly Higgins at this year’s Elevate Festival. (Photo source: University of Copenhagen, licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 Generic, via Wikipedia)
Among this year’s participants: eco-genocide attorney Polly Higgins (UK), Jacob Appelbaum (US), Occupy Wall Street (US), Mark Stevenson (UK), and many more. There was also a video message by Noam Chomsky. Needless to say, this pow-wow is way out in the fringes.
This year the motto is: “Elevate the Apocalypse?”
According to Austrian public broadcasting network ORF, Real Climate blog contributor Stefan Rahmstorf also participated in the first day of “Elevate the Apocalypse?”
In a piece titled Elevate 2012 Opens With End Of World Mood, the ORF writes that “the world looks bad, real bad, also without its apocalyptic crackpots” who believe the Earth has got less than 2 more months to go, and that “the situation is hopeless”.
Why all the doom and gloom from this group of “enlightened progressive thinkers”. Well in Europe being convinced the end of the planet is imminent is enlightened and progressive thinking.

The ORF writes:
The emotional downer was delivered by superstar Noam Chomsky. Via video he reported on what he reads daily in the newspaper. And that is worrisome. The polar ice caps are melting, climate change is being denied by a few people, but is still unstoppable. He estimates the chances of surviving are scant.
Climate scientist Stefan Rahmstorf did not refute these bleak outlooks. Concerning all the ‘It’s not all that bad”-studies’, he thinks the media reporting comes down to about 5 seriously senseless studies. Again and again they are gladly financed by the coal lobby.”
Such stunning progressive thinking, wouldn’t you say? RealClimate science now joins Occupy Wall Street and Noam Chomsky.
Rahmstorf was then followed by an equally hopelessly kooky activist, British “attorney for the planet” Polly Higgins, who, according to ORF, “has the aim of getting the UN to recognize eco-genocide as a “crime against Peace”.
The ORF writes:
The opponents are ultimately large corporations and a not so small number of governments. (…) By 2020 Higgins wants to end the eco-genocide and calls for everyone to join in.”
Dear opposing governments (85% of all countries), skeptics and non-alarmists, get ready to be lynched in a few years time should these fringe radicals get their way.

Guest post by Ira Glickstein
Some people claim that there’s a woman to blame,
But I know, it’s my own damn fault..
The original Jimmy Buffet lyrics say “woman to blame” but I changed it to “human” in the title of this post. Perhaps I should have left it as “woman” since, without their civilizing influence, we men would still be huddled in caves, wearing bearskins, and human-caused global warming would not be an issue. In 1880, WS Gilbert said women were the really civilized humans, while Darwinian Man, even when well-behaved, was nothing more than a Monkey Shaved :^)
This is the fourth of my Tale of the Global Warming Tiger series where I allocate the supposed 0.8ºC warming since 1880 to: (1) Data Bias, (2) Natural Cycles, and (3) AGW (human-caused global warming), the subject of this posting. Click Tiger’s Tale and Tail :^) to see my allocation and read the original story.
ANTHROPOGENIC GLOBAL WARMING (AGW) 
This posting is about how human activities, particularly burning of fossil fuels and land use changes have contributed to the global warming experienced since 1880. According to Willis Eschenbach’s excellent WUWT posting (with the same title as mine – great minds think alike :^);
I think that the preponderance of evidence shows that humans are the main cause of the increase in atmospheric CO2. It is unlikely that the change in CO2 is from the overall temperature increase. During the ice age to interglacial transitions, on average a change of 7°C led to a doubling of CO2. We have seen about a tenth of that change (0.7°C) since 1850, so we’d expect a CO2 change from temperature alone of only about 20 ppmv.
Thus, about 80% of the CO2 rise from about 280 ppmv to 390 ppmv since 1880 is due to human activities.
I estimate that 0.1ºC of the supposed 0.8ºC warming is AGW, where we humans are to “blame” (assuming that that tiny amount of warming will make much of a difference, or, even if it does, that it will turn out to be bad). 
In comments to my previous postings in this series, some WUWT readers have suggested that the entire supposed 0.8ºC warming since 1880 is data bias. In other words, there has actually been no net warming at all. I disagree. Even if the terrestrial temperature record since 1880 is questionable, particularly in light of repeated “adjustments” by the official climate Team that appear to overstate the warming, it seems to me the satellite data, available since 1979, clearly proves there has been considerable net warming since that date.
Other WUWT readers agree we are in a warming cycle but claim that natural processes are responsible for ALL the warming. Their main argument is that rising CO2 and other carbon gas levels do not cause much if any warming, and, even that amount of warming is counteracted by additional clouds that raise the Earth’s albedo. I agree the great majority of warming is natural, but I think it is clear that human activities are responsible for some of it. Yes, clouds almost certainly have a net negative feedback (despite virtually all the official climate Team models to the contrary), but, for the negative cloud feedback to work, temperatures must rise at least a little bit to generate the additional clouds.
DESCRIPTION OF MY GRAPHIC
The above graphic traces my estimate of the actual warming since 1880, and my projection several decades into the future. To liven it up I have drawn the curves atop a photo of some white-roofed houses in Greece and quoted from The Independent, 27 May 2009, under the headline Obama’s climate guru: Paint your roof white! they say:
Some people believe that nuclear power is the answer to climate change, others have proposed green technologies such as wind or solar power, but Barack Obama’s top man on global warming has suggested something far simpler – painting your roof white.
At the time, Anthony posted the news on WUWT, suggesting:
Maybe now NOAA will get rid of all remaining rooftop climate monitoring stations or stations sited over asphalt …
An alert reader, E.M. Smith, went further and wrote:
Lets start a surface stations project to paint the black roofs and asphalt under temperature stations white. We can do it to “save the planet from global warming and offset carbon”… and it would actually work to get the global temperature record down too ….
Undoubtedly, land use changes such as clearing forests and paving large areas with asphalt and erecting buildings have generally reduced the albedo of the Earth and thus increased warming. I don’t think Secretary Chu’s white roof idea will have much effect, but, any effect it does have will be in the direction of reducing warming, and I doubt it could ever be so successful that it pushes us into catastrophic global cooling!
Natural Cycles: The green line represents net warming not under human control or effect, and it shows a rise of about 0.4ºC since 1880.
The lighter green line is my projection of Natural Cycles assuming that Solar Cycle #24 will have a low Sunspot peak of 60 or less in 2013 or later, and that the following SC #25 and SC #26 will be similarly low and long. It is virtually certain SC #24 will be low, but pure speculation regarding SC #25 and SC #26. Of course, the varying strengths of ocean oscillations and volcanic eruptions and other hard to predict events may affect natural processes in either direction from my projections.
I have sketched a thin green line that indicates what may happen if we get a series of particularly strong events, similar to the El Niño that caused global temperatures to peak in 1999, and/or if subsequent Solar Cycles return to their previously high Sunspot levels.
AGW The violet line represents the sum of Natural Cycles and AGW and it shows an additional net rise of about 0.1ºC since 1880.
The lighter violet line is my projection assuming human activities will continue more or less as they have in the past, with minimal reductions in human-generated carbon gases and land use patterns, showing an additional nearly 0.1ºC rise between 2011 and 2050, for a total AGW since 1880 approaching 0.2ºC.
I have sketched a thin violet line indicating what may happen if Natural Cycles follow the thin green line projection and if, in addition, humans accelerate emissions of carbon gases and land use patterns that reduce the Earth’s albedo.
WHY AGW IS REAL
According to Roy Spencer, PhD:
Greenhouse components in the atmosphere (mostly water vapor, clouds, carbon dioxide, and methane) exert strong controls over how fast the Earth loses IR energy to outer space. Mankind’s burning of fossil fuels creates more atmospheric carbon dioxide. As we add more CO2, more infrared energy is trapped, strengthening the Earth’s greenhouse effect. This causes a warming tendency in the lower atmosphere and at the surface. As of 2008, it is believed that we have enhanced the Earth’s natural greenhouse effect by about 1%.
Absent the greenhouse effect of the atmosphere, the Earth would be cooler by about 33ºC, and 1% of that is 0.33ºC, which is more than the 0.1ºC I have allocated to AGW and that does not even include land use effects. But, again according to Spencer:
Net feedbacks in the real climate system — on both short and long time scales — are probably negative. A misinterpretation of cloud behavior has led climate modelers to build models in which cloud feedbacks are instead positive, which has led the models to predict too much global warming in response to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.
He explains that IPCC climate models assume a feedback of from 0.9 to 1.9 W m-2 K-1, and that any value below 3.3 represents positive feedback, while any level above that is negative feedback. He concludes from his study of satellite data that:
the line slopes diagnosed from the satellite data … might actually be an UNDERESTIMATE of the true feedback occurring, which could be 7 W m-2 K-1 or more.
If that turns out to be true, then the actual sensitivity to CO2 doubling would be far less than the 2ºC to 5ºC or more projected by the IPCC. Indeed it could be 0.5ºC, or even less. As current CO2 levels are about 390 ppmv we are about 40% to a doubling from historic 280 ppmv levels, the actual temperature rise due to the human component of AGW could be 0.2ºC.
In addition, burning of fossil fuels has a side effect of increasing light-colored aerosols that reflect Sunlight and thus prevent some of it from reaching the surface, counteracting some of the warming due to atmospheric CO2. Efforts to clean the air are said to have reduced such aerosols and, inadvertently, caused more warming.
Please note that I have low-balled my AGW value by about half because I discount the approximately 20% of rise in CO2 levels as due to the temperature rise itself causing less CO2 to be absorbed by the polar and winter temperate oceans and more to be emitted by the equatorial and summer temperate oceans and I also believe there are other negative feedback components yet to be exposed. I expect some WUWT readers will challenge even my low estimate and I request you back your challenges up with science-based reasoning, which I would love to hear.
CONCLUSIONS AND REQUESTS
If readers have additional information or corrections to what I said about AGW, or if there are other related factors I missed, I would appreciate detailed comments to improve my summary.
It seems to me that my estimate of 0.1ºC for AGW is justified, and perhaps a bit understated. I am open to hearing the opinions of WUWT readers who may think I have over- (or under-) estimated this component of the supposed 0.8ºC rise in global temperatures since 1880.
In my first and second and third postings in this Tale of the Global Warming Tiger series, I asked for comments on my allocations: to: (1) Data Bias 0.3ºC, (2) Natural Cycles 0.4ºC, and (3) AGW 0.1ºC. Quite a few readers were kind enough to comment, either expressing general agreement or offering their own estimates.
What do you think? I have been keeping a spreadsheet record of WUWT reader’s opinions, which I appreciate and value greatly, along with their screen names, and I plan to report the results in the next posting of this series:
Is the Global Warming Tiger a Pussy Cat? – If, as many of us expect, natural processes lead to stabilization of global temperatures over the coming decades, and perhaps a bit of cooling, we will realize the whole Global Warming uproar was like the boy who saw a pussy cat and cried tiger.

How delicious! Mike is going to sue the gummint for climate change. They either agree with him and pay out or they argue that he is wrong on all counts – which he is – and have to admit that the whole thing is a charade.



The Treaty of Waitangi promised that the Government had a duty to actively protect Maori interests. One Iwi leader says that the impending catastrophe of climate change means they have failed to meet that standard.



Mike Smith, chair of the Climate Change Iwi Leaders Group announced on Tuesday that he was suing the Government because “the Crown is failing to protect all New Zealanders, but especially Maori, from catastrophic effects of climate change”.



“Maori are particularly vulnerable to climate change, being disproportionately represented amongst the poor, who will be the hardest hit,” he said.



Mike is right. The poor will be the hardest hit. Not by the climate crisis but by taxes and EV subsidies and higher electricity prices and ETS charges at the petrol pump and so on.



The Crown lawyers will have a hard job following the government logic of solving the climate crisis via ever-increasing taxes to offset something that is not happening while simultaneously arguing that these taxes are not going to impact the poor.



He said that traditional resources, including fisheries, would be affected by ocean acidification, and that flooding would damage coastal communities. 



There is no ocean acidification that is going to affect fisheries, but if the Crown lawyers argue that, they will have to get some truthful scientists to prove that the alarmist ocean acidification statements are nonsense. 



There is no flooding of coastal communities due to the climate crisis. Sea levels are rising 1-2 mm/year, as they have done for the last 100+ years of recorded measurement. But if the Crown lawyers get experts to argue that fact in court they will be undermining the climate emergency nonsense.



[…] He wants the courts to declare that the Crown will be in breach of duties owed to Maori unless it reduces total greenhouse gases by half by 2030, and to zero by 2050.



What a shame that Marsden, and the others who drafted the Treaty on behalf of the English and Maori in 1840, did not think to include in either version of the Treaty document an absolute limit on CO2 levels and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.



He filed proceedings in his personal capacity, citing the interests of all Maori.



The filing argues a breach of duty under the Treaty of Waitangi and the Bill of Rights Act. 



  
All power to you, Mike, I have my popcorn ready.

Mexican president Andrés Manuel López Obrador will be coming to DC tomorrow as part of a White House event related to the renegotiation of NAFTA into the USMCA (U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement). The USMCA entered into force on July 1, and as my colleagues have indicated, there’s actually not all that much to celebrate. What we have tomorrow, then, is an event based on political theater more than on policy. The celebratory press conference was as much of a goal as the new agreement itself. We should be happy that Trump did not try to withdraw from NAFTA, but we should be uncomfortable with the way the NAFTA renegotiation took place, and also with some of the USMCA results.



In terms of that political theater, President Trump is excited to claim a political victory, but whose political victory is it? Is it Trump’s or does it belong to the House Democrats who pushed for last minute changes to the agreement? As this article from _Inside U.S. Trade_ notes, the Democrats who were involved think they deserve the credit:



Former Vice President Joe Biden should focus on trade policy during the presidential campaign trail and tout the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement as a win for his party, not the Trump administration, a lawmaker key to the renegotiation of NAFTA told _Inside U.S. Trade_ this week.



President Trump is touting the deal as the fulfillment of his 2016 campaign promise to shake up U.S. trade policy and get rid of NAFTA. In a June 20 Tulsa rally, Trump said his administration was “enacting fair trade deals that finally, after all these years, put America first.” He later told a crowd in Wisconsin that his administration “got rid of the worst trade deal ever made in the history of mankind,” referring to NAFTA. “Under this administration, you know that American workers like you are a national treasure,” he said, touting USMCA.



But Rep. Jimmy Gomez (D-CA), who was appointed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) last year to lead labor talks in USMCA negotiations with the Trump administration, said Biden could score points in the campaign by focusing on trade.



“To the Biden campaign directly I said ‘Do not run away from trade; lean in to trade,’” Gomez said in a July 1 interview. “Leaning into trade is not only a way to build the economy but also, how do you protect workers’ rights? How do you protect the environment? How do you advance other goals instead of just looking at how much you grow the GDP of the country?”



The political messaging here is going to be really interesting. Over the course of the next several months, we may or may not see much in terms of changes as we transition from NAFTA to the USMCA (though businesses can expect a lot of new paperwork). Perhaps automakers will increase the wages of auto workers in Mexico, which at some point will lead to higher car prices for consumers, although it’s hard to say exactly when given the current economic climate. And perhaps we will see some trade enforcement actions, for example against Mexican restrictions on biotech products, but those will take a while to play out. What we may see more quickly in terms of disputes is litigation related to the denial of labor rights in Mexican factories. There was an innovation in USMCA, pushed by the House Democrats and never before seen in a trade agreement, that targets the labor practices of specific factories directly, rather than the traditional approach of challenging a foreign government for not enforcing its laws or complying with international agreements. If these cases come, it will be interesting to see how Biden and Trump try to take credit. It’s easy to see how a Democratic politician like Biden can talk up labor rights. Does Trump even know how to do that, and would he bother trying? We’ll find out.



All of this emphasizes the point made earlier by my colleagues: the USMCA is not really about free trade. We already had mostly free trade under the NAFTA. Some updates to deal with digital trade issues were certainly needed, and Canada opened up its market to a few more dairy and other agriculture products, but many of the other changes were about either the Trump administration or the House Democrats pushing other priorities. From the perspective of trade liberalization, both sides should be trying to avoid the blame for USMCA. But politicians often think more about politics than policy, and both sides will likely be pushing a narrative that this was a win for them.



My guess is that the details will be so hard to follow for most voters that it will all be a wash in terms of U.S. politics. The average person will have a lot of trouble sorting through the different claims. Trump will assert that the USMCA is a victory for him, without offering any details. Biden may respond that the Democrats made major changes, so it’s really a victory for them. Any voters who are truly undecided at this point are unlikely to be swayed by any of this. But political theater is part of politics, so the show will go on tomorrow at the White House regardless, and it will be a few months before we find out what the changes from NAFTA to the USMCA actually mean in practice.

Candidate Barack Obama was widely seen as running on a peace platform. More recently President Barack Obama was awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace for supposedly offering a new international approach. Yet he is considering a major military escalation in Afghanistan.



Instead, the president should rethink Washington’s objective. The conflict has become his war. He should not ask, is Afghanistan winnable? Rather, the right question is what should the U.S. attempt to achieve? The goal should be to advance American security, not build an Afghan state.



The president need not rush his decision. Hawkish demagogues who entrapped the U.S. in an unnecessary war in Iraq hope to do the same in Afghanistan. For instance, Rep. Cynthia Lummis (R‐​Wyoming) claimed: “the lack of decisiveness about how to best proceed is emboldening our enemies and endangering our troops and friends.” The worst policy, however, would be to mimic the foolish decisiveness of President George W. Bush.





After eight years, Washington has not created the answer in Kabul.



Afghanistan was President Bush’s “good war,” in which Washington ousted the ruling Taliban for hosting al‐​Qaeda. But he quickly lost interest in Afghanistan, shifting Washington’s attention and resources to Iraq. Conflict in Afghanistan has raged for eight years–longer than the U.S. spent fighting World Wars I and II combined–consuming nearly 900 U.S. and 600 allied lives, as well as $220 billion. The Afghan people, too, have suffered greatly.



Yet “victory” looks ever more distant. Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, warned that the situation in Afghanistan is “deteriorating.” The government barely functions; drug money pervades the otherwise moribund economy. The number of estimated insurgents, Taliban attacks, and allied casualties all are rising. Barely a third of the territory can be said to be under the central government’s (very loose) control, and even large urban areas are no longer safe. Afghan President Hamid Karzai’s supporters engaged in ostentatious and widespread electoral fraud.



Indeed, the election imbroglio highlights the administration’s challenge. White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel declared: “The result, for us and for the president, is whether, in fact, there’s a credible government and a legitimate process.” But that question has been answered–in the negative. The initial vote was marred by widespread irregularities; the fraudulently reelected president accepted a run‐​off only because the foreign military powers keeping him in power demanded one; no one imagines President Karzai losing even if Abdullah Abdullah reverses his decision to boycott the poll. A forced coalition/​national unity government would offer little more legitimacy.



President Obama termed the war one of “necessity” and in March added 21,000 combat troops to the 47,000 Americans already stationed in Afghanistan. (Another 37,000 allied, largely NATO, forces are on station, though often where they are not needed.) Now the president’s hand‐​picked commander, Gen. Stanley McChrystal, is pushing for upwards of 80,000 more personnel, with 40,000 apparently the “minimum” acceptable in his view.



The administration is worried about the political implications of escalation and is considering a compromise–adding some troops, but fewer than desired by Gen. McChrystal. However, pursuing expansive objectives without providing the necessary resources would be the worst policy. Commented _Washington Post_ columnist Eugene Robinson: “This game’s been going on for eight years. It’s time to raise or fold.”



But raising would not guarantee success. The allies initially deployed 60,000 personnel in Bosnia, a much smaller territory in which conflict had ceased. At its maximum Russia had 118,000 troops in Afghanistan, which proved to be too few. Even an extra 80,000 troops–which the U.S. does not have handy to deploy in Afghanistan–would not be enough. Under traditional counterinsurgency doctrine, Afghanistan, with 33 million people, many of them living in remote villages amidst rugged terrain, warrants 660,000 allied personnel. Nor is NATO reinforcement a realistic option. President Obama, Defense Secretary Robert Gates, and Gen. McChrystal all have pushed for more assistance, but garnered few commitments and even fewer boots on the ground. Europeans have far less stomach for continuing the war than do Americans.



The critical issue is Washington’s objective. The U.S. long ago achieved its goal of displacing and weakening al‐​Qaeda (despite the failure to capture or kill Osama bin Laden) and ousting the Taliban government which gave the organization refuge. That success persists despite recent Taliban gains. National Security Adviser James Jones estimated fewer than 100 al‐​Qaeda members are operating in Afghanistan, and said they have “no bases, no ability to launch attacks on either us or our allies.”



Ousting the Taliban was simple compared to creating “an effective and representative government,” in the words of Marin Strmecki, formerly at the Pentagon, or “a national representative government that is able to govern, defend, and sustain itself,” according to four scholars at the Center for American Progress, or “a credible Afghan partner for this process that can provide the security and the type of services that the Afghan people need,” in Rahm Emanuel’s words. Such a partner doesn’t currently exist and is no where close to existing.



Everyone uses the old adage that Afghanistan is the “graveyard of empires,” but outside powers never have had much success in imposing their will on the Afghan people. Nation‐​building is difficult enough: only in Germany and Japan, with ordered societies and democratic traditions, has the U.S. had unambiguous success. Third World states have proved largely impervious to Western attentions.



Afghanistan is no different. Afghanistan “worked” during the mid‐​20th century under a monarchy which understood the limits of its power. The regime respected the poor, traditional, autonomous tribal‐​based society which it purportedly ruled. And, most important, there were no foreign military occupiers.



Social engineering by Washington would be difficult in the best of circumstances. Afghanistan’s challenges are daunting. Observed the _Economist_ magazine: “The country’s mountains and deserts are forbidding; its tribal make‐​up bewildering; and, after three decades of war, its communities broken, poor and ignorant. Well‐​meant actions often have unintended effects: fighting can create more insurgents than it kills; foreigners are blamed for attacks that hurt Afghan civilians; and schemes to win people over can deepen antagonism.”



Afghanistan hosts 20 ethnic groups. Even the Pashtuns are divided into 50 tribes. This is not a society traditionally welcoming to outsiders, let alone foreigners. Afghanistan has become the world’s largest opium producer. Finally, Afghan society has been badly deformed by three decades of war.



After eight years, Washington has not created the answer in Kabul. Matthew Hoh, a former Marine Corps officer who recently resigned from the State Department, explained: “Like the Soviets, we continue to secure and bolster a failing state, while encouraging an ideology and system of government unknown and unwanted by its people.” Ralph Peters, a columnist who backed the Iraq war, criticized protecting “an Afghan government the people despise.”



The inadequacies of the Karzai regime are manifest and multiple. The International Crisis Group pointed to “a highly centralized constitutional order in which the legislature has been denied the tools to check an overbearing executive, and a neglected judiciary, which contributes to the climate of impunity and corruption fuelling the insurgency.” Malalai Joya, vilified by fundamentalists for daring to run for parliament and promote women’s rights, complained: “Your governments have replaced the fundamentalist rule of the Taliban with another fundamentalist regime of warlords.”



Then there is the recent flagrant election fraud, which, wrote Hoh, “will call into question worldwide our government’s military, economic and diplomatic support for an invalid and illegitimate Afghan government.” Karzai’s allies claim that the Afghan president has learned from the experience, but what has he learned? If he can get away with rampant fraud, whether or not a second poll is held, he likely will become even less tractable. U.S. escalation will be seen as support for the existing regime, not for the sort of idealized system Washington claims to support.



No intrinsic strategic importance justifies attempting to construct a genuine Afghan state. Boston University’s Andrew Bacevich explained: “No serious person thinks that Afghanistan–remote, impoverished, barely qualifying as a nation-state–seriously matters to the United States.” Afghanistan’s importance primarily derives from its impact on nuclear‐​armed Pakistan, whose largely ungoverned border territories provide a haven for both Taliban forces and what remains of al‐​Qaeda.



Blogger Paul Mirengoff contended that “Ceding Afghanistan to [America’s main] enemy would have serious adverse implications for Pakistan.” The _Washington Post_ worried: “success by the [Taliban] movement in toppling the government of either country would be a catastrophe for the interests of the United States and major allies such as India.” Others predict a veritable regional disaster if the U.S. withdraws.



However, a semi‐​stable, semi‐​workable Afghan state doesn’t necessarily work to Pakistan’s advantage. First, how would it affect Islamabad’s most serious security concern–the regional balance with India? Pakistan strongly supported the Taliban regime pre‐​9/​11 for a reason. Second, Afghans enjoying the benefits of peace might not welcome jihadists and terrorists, encouraging the latter to remain in Pakistan’s largely autonomous border provinces.



Most important, Pakistan seems more likely to be destabilized by an endless, escalating conflict than a Taliban advance. Islamabad’s vulnerabilities are obvious, with a weak civilian government facing a complex mix of poverty, instability, insurgency, and terrorism.



Unfortunately, the war in neighboring Afghanistan exacerbates all of these problems. Argued Hoh: “Our presence in Afghanistan has only increased destabilization and insurgency in Pakistan.” First, the war has pushed Afghan insurgents across the border. Second, cooperation with unpopular U.S. policy has reinforced the Zardari government’s appearance as an American toady. Ever‐​rising American demands further undercut Pakistani sovereignty and increase public hostility.



From Pakistan’s perspective, limiting the war on almost any terms would be better than prosecuting it for years, even to “victory,” whatever that would mean. In fact, the least likely outcome is a takeover by widely unpopular Pakistani militants. The Pakistan military is the nation’s strongest institution; while the army might not be able to rule alone, it can prevent any other force from ruling.



Indeed, Bennett Ramberg made the important point: “Pakistan, Iran and the former Soviet republics to the north have demonstrated a brutal capacity to suppress political violence to ensure survival. This suggests that even were Afghanistan to become a terrorist haven, the neighborhood can adapt and resist.” The results might not be pretty, but the region would not descend into chaos. In contrast, warned Bacevich: “To risk the stability of that nuclear‐​armed state in the vain hope of salvaging Afghanistan would be a terrible mistake.”



Washington is left with only bad options. One is to continue trying to “fix” Afghanistan. Gen. Stanley McChrystal argued: “A strategy that does not leave Afghanistan in a stable position is probably a short‐​sighted strategy.” Moreover, said Gen. McChrystal, American strategy must “earn the support of the people,” which will win the war “regardless of how many militants are killed or captured.”



Max Boot of the Council on Foreign Relations even suggested that “Poor governance is an argument for, not against, a troop surge. Only by sending more personnel, military and civilian, can President Obama improve the Afghan government’s performance, reverse the Taliban’s gains and prevent al-Qaeda’s allies from regaining the ground they lost after 9/11.” In short, failing to create a functional state after eight years of war means Washington should double down, pushing more lives and money into the growing pot.



America’s well‐​disciplined and well‐​trained forces can do much, but not everything. Hoh observed that no “military force has ever been tasked with such a complex, opaque and Sisyphean mission as the U.S. military has received in Afghanistan.” Even if better deployed in more heavily populated areas, the odds of reasonable success in reasonable time at reasonable cost seem long at best.



The point is not that the majority of Afghans love the Taliban. But many dislike the Karzai government, local warlords, and/​or allied forces. The costs of “winning” such a complicated game almost certainly would outweigh the benefits of even the most optimistic projections. As Peters bluntly states, “the hearts and minds of the Afghans not only can’t be won, but aren’t worth winning.” More likely than victory would be years of war, persistent insurgent activity, thousands more American casualties, hundreds of billions of dollars more outlays, persistent regional instability, and ultimate U.S. withdrawal.



What are the alternatives? The status quo offers little hope of reversing the Taliban’s gains. Concentrating allied troops in the cities might offer greater urban security but would concede most of the country to the insurgency. Accelerating training and equipping of the Afghan army and police would yield positive results only if the resulting forces proved to be competent and honest, as well as competently and honestly led.



The better policy would be for Washington to begin drawing down its combat forces. The outcome might be Taliban conquest and rule, but equally likely is continuing conflict and divided governance amongst competing political factions, ethnic groups, and tribes. The resulting patchwork would be tragic, but the fighting would no longer be inflamed by outside intervention.



Would adverse consequences extend beyond the region? The _Economist_ hyperbolically fears that “defeat for the West in Afghanistan would embolden its opponents not just in Pakistan, but all around the world, leaving it more open to attacks.” However, jihadists are most likely to attack Westerners when their grievances are ongoing. Groups based in Amman, London, Madrid, and Riyadh as well as America are more likely to act if the American government is killing more rather than fewer Muslims in Afghanistan.



Moreover, escalation, followed by additional years of conflict and then ultimate defeat would multiply the harm to America’s reputation. The Soviet Union made this mistake. Author Victor Sebestyen reviewed the minutes of meetings between Politburo and military officials and reported: “The Soviets saw withdrawal as potentially fatal to their prestige in the cold war, so they became mired deeper and deeper in their failed occupation.” Even reformist Mikhail Gorbachev dithered out of fear of the impact on Moscow’s image before finally withdrawing Soviet forces in 1989.



The most serious argument against withdrawal is that al‐​Qaeda would gain additional “safe havens.” Fred Kagan of the American Enterprise Institute argued that “Afghanistan is not now a sanctuary for al‐​Qaeda, but it would likely become one again if we abandoned it.” Richard Holbrooke, the Obama administration’s special envoy to South Asia, contended: “without any shadow of a doubt, al‐​Qaeda would move back into Afghanistan, set up a larger presence, recruit more people and pursue its objectives against the United States even more aggressively.” Preventing this is “the only justification for what we’re doing,” he insisted.



Yet there is no evidence that al‐​Qaeda has moved into territory currently governed by the Taliban. Even Taliban‐​controlled Afghanistan would not be a genuine safe haven. Noted Stephen Walt of the Kennedy School: “The Taliban will not be able to protect [bin Laden] from U.S. commandos, cruise missiles and armed drones. He and his henchmen will always have to stay in hiding, which is why even an outright Taliban victory will not enhance their position very much.”



Indeed, anti‐​terrorism expert Marc Sageman observed in recent congressional testimony: “there is no reason for al‐​Qaeda to return to Afghanistan. It seems safer in Pakistan at the moment.” Other options include other failed or semi‐​failed states, such as Somalia and Yemen. The defuse jihadist movement which has organized most of the terrorist plots since 9/11 has found adequate safe havens even in Europe.



No wonder Stephen Biddle of the Council on Foreign Relations admitted, while calling for continuing “a war effort that is costly, risky and worth waging–but only barely so,” that preventing al‐​Qaeda from moving back into Afghanistan was “the weakest argument for waging the kind of war we are now waging.” The U.S. doesn’t have the resources necessary to wage war everywhere terrorists might conceivably seek a safe haven and need not do so in any case.



The administration should adjust its policy ends. Washington’s principal objective should be protecting U.S. security. The _Washington Post_ ’s David Ignatius railed against adopting “a more selfish counterterrorism strategy that drops the rebuilding part and seeks to assassinate America’s enemies.” But the U.S. government’s overriding obligation is to protect U.S. citizens, and that means focusing on al‐​Qaeda rather than the Taliban, forestalling and disrupting terrorist operations against America. Doing so requires sharing intelligence widely among affected nations, squeezing terrorist funding networks, utilizing Special Forces on the ground, employing predator and air strikes–judiciously, given the tragic risk of civilian casualties, which both raises moral issues and fuels anti‐​American sentiment–and cooperating with various Afghan forces and the Pakistani government.



In contrast, it is not necessary to build a functional state in Kabul allied with the U.S. Noted Sageman: “The proposed counter‐​insurgency strategy in Afghanistan is at present irrelevant to the goal of disrupting, dismantling and defeating al‐​Qaeda, which is located in Pakistan. None of the plots in the West has any connection to any Afghan insurgent group, labeled under the umbrella name ‘Afghan Taliban’.” In Afghanistan Washington should tolerate any regime or group, or combination of regimes or groups, willing to cooperate in preventing terrorist attacks.



Obviously, policymakers disagree on the likelihood of success of such a political strategy. One unnamed anti‐​terrorism official told the _Washington Post_ that the prospects of political reconciliation are “dim and grim.” Other analysts contend that only major battlefield victories would encourage Taliban forces to surrender.



Yet history suggests that accommodation is possible and certainly worth pursuing. After all, the Karzai government has made deals with warlords and narcotics producers alike. Washington once worked, reluctantly to be sure, with the Taliban regime to combat drug production. There are indications that the Taliban was angered by al-Qaeda’s 9/11 assault on the U.S. Moreover, a number of Taliban commanders defected in the early years after American intervention.



Thus, Washington should attempt to split the Afghan insurgency. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton once equated al‐​Qaeda and the Taliban, but more recently admitted: “Not every Taliban is an extremist ally.” In fact, the Taliban mixes hard‐​core militants and disaffected residents. Arsalan Rahmani, once Islamic affairs minister in the Taliban government and now a member of the Afghan parliament, explained: “Some are fighting to go to paradise, but among the Taliban leaders most want peace. Afghanistan is their homeland and they want peace here.”



The distinction is widely recognized. _Newsweek_ ’s Fareed Zakaria wrote: “It is unclear how many Taliban fighters believe in a global jihadist ideology, but most U.S. commanders with whom I’ve spoken feel that the number is less than 30 percent. The other 70 percent are driven by money, gangland peer pressure or opposition to Karzai.” Similarly, the _Boston Globe_ quoted an American intelligence official who contended that only ten percent of insurgents were Taliban ideologues, while “Ninety percent is a tribal, localized insurgency.”



Even Gen. McChrystal advocated going “pretty high up” to give even Taliban commanders “the opportunity to come in.” He added that Pashtuns “have always been willing to change positions, change sides. I don’t think much of the Taliban are ideologically driven; I think they are practically driven. I’m not sure they wouldn’t flip to our side.”



Washington will need to display both knowledge and nuance, admittedly too often in short supply, to exploit Taliban differences. However, being out of power apparently has left the Taliban even less well‐​disposed to bin Laden & Co. Explained John Mueller of Ohio State University: “There are reports that Omar’s group has made clear its rupture with al‐​Qaeda in talks with Saudi Arabia.”



Thus, the Taliban may well focus on its own interests. Mullah Mutawakkil, once a minister in the Taliban government, believes a deal is possible: remove bounties on commanders, release insurgent prisoners held at Bagram air base, and accept Taliban rule in Afghanistan’s southern provinces in return for a commitment not to allow use of Taliban‐​controlled territory in attacks on the West.



This would not be a radical policy, since Washington already has ceded certain areas to warlord control. Insurgent leaders know well that denial is less costly than control: Washington could launch targeted strikes against any al‐​Qaeda operations and oust any regime, Taliban or other, which allied itself with terrorists. This approach also would demonstrate to the Muslim world that the U.S. is targeting terrorists, not Islamic governments. In contrast, warns Mutawakkil: “If the Taliban fight on and finally became Afghanistan’s government with the help of al‐​Qaeda, it would then be very difficult to separate them.”



Currently joined with the Taliban are opportunistic warlords such as Gulbaddin Hekmatyar and Jalaluddin Haqqani. Washington should appeal to differences among uneasy allies and offer to buy off–or lease–the more venal opposition.



An essential aspect of this strategy, however, is withdrawing allied troops, since many Afghan fighters are determined to resist any foreign occupiers. A continuing occupation, no matter how well‐​intentioned from our perspective, will generate “more casualties, irritation and recruitment for the Taliban,” in the words of Nicholas Kristof.



In fact, the longer more U.S. forces remain, the harder more insurgents will resist. In 2007, for instance, 27 often feuding groups coalesced in Pakistan in response to U.S. airstrikes. In Afghanistan the population has not turned on the Taliban the way Iraqis turned on the al‐​Qaeda. Lt. Col. Daniel L. Davis, who served in both Afghanistan and Iraq, advocated a U.S. withdrawal over the next 18 months: “Many experts in and from Afghanistan warn that our presence over the past eight years has already hardened a meaningful percentage of the population into viewing the United States as an army of occupation which should be opposed and resisted.”



Unfortunately, there are limits to Washington’s ability to ameliorate this result. Argued Hugh Gusterson, of George Mason University: “The Pentagon will try to minimize the insult through cultural sensitivity training and new doctrines that emphasize befriending the locals, but they will fail because it’s in the very nature of counterinsurgency that occupying forces must be intrusive to be effective. And when you have thousands of foreign troops being shot at, accidents and atrocities happen. The more such troops you have, the more accidents and atrocities you get.”



There remains the emotional case for escalation. Army Sgt. Teresa Coble complained to the _Washington Times_ : “We would not be honoring the lives of the troops who died if we left here without finishing our mission.” But what is the mission? One should mourn those whose lives were sacrificed by their government for any policy which failed. However, al‐​Qaeda has been largely defanged. The failure to create an Afghan nation is one of policy, not personnel. It would not honor American servicemen and women to needlessly toss away even more lives to continue this failed policy.



It would be especially foolish to embark upon a campaign of escalation if it is not sustainable over the long‐​term. And escalation is not. After nearly eight years of war, the American people are losing faith–not in the necessity of killing or capturing terrorists, but in the dream of remaking Afghanistan. The latest CNN poll indicates that six of ten Americans oppose sending more troops to Afghanistan. Nearly half want to reduce manpower levels or even withdraw all troops. A majority also believes that Afghanistan has turned into another Vietnam.



Advocates of years more of costly war for dubious gain argue that the public _should_ support their policy, but that is irrelevant. The president must base U.S. policy on what the public likely _will_ support. Else his strategy will be doomed from the start.



In 2002 Barack Obama warned against fighting a war “without a clear rationale and without strong international support,” and that an invasion of Iraq would yield: “a U.S. occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, and with unintended consequences.” That is happening in Afghanistan. In fact, one could imagine bin Laden hoping to ensnare the U.S. in a no‐​win war in Afghanistan. Seth Jones and Martin Libicki of the Rand Corporation noted that “combat operations in Muslim societies” are “likely to increase terrorist recruitment.” Indeed, parody has become truth. “Reported” the _Onion_ : “According to sources at the Pentagon, American quagmire‐​building efforts continued apace in Afghanistan this week, as the geographically rugged, politically unstable region remained ungovernable, death tolls continued to rise, and the grim military campaign persisted as hopelessly as ever.”



Of course, the desire of many Washington policymakers to improve the lives of Afghans is genuine. Most Afghans want peace and many Afghans desire American aid to better their land. Given enough resources and time, courageous and dedicated U.S. personnel could conceivably succeed in remaking Afghanistan. But the chances are slim while the cost in lives and treasure inevitably would be high–too high.



Getting out of Afghanistan won’t be as easy as getting in. The administration should develop a strategy to steadily reduce rather than increase America’s military presence. Combat forces should be fully withdrawn. The U.S. should focus on counter‐​terrorism. The time and manner of getting out should reflect potentially changing circumstances. But withdrawal should be Washington’s ultimate objective.



An independent America was born of a rugged determination by common folk to govern themselves. It should not surprise modern Americans that many Afghans feel the same way. Despite the persistent delusion in Washington that the rest of world desperately desires to become America’s next attempt at social engineering, most Afghans are not waiting for U.S. advisers, diplomats, and soldiers to show them a better way. To the contrary, many are ready to fight to follow their own way.



Their determination presents the president with a momentous decision. The administration should narrow the Afghan mission. Washington’s objective should be disrupting al‐​Qaeda wherever located, whether Afghanistan, Pakistan, or elsewhere. On occasion that will warrant military action, but more often other tools will be required. Even with the finest military on earth the U.S. government cannot do everything. Reconsidering American strategy in Afghanistan is an important way for Washington policymakers to acknowledge the limits of U.S. power. Changing American priorities in this way would be a giant step by President Obama towards actually earning a Nobel award bestowed more out of future hope than past achievement.

"**Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday morning. We'll have another update for you at 18:00 GMT.**
Conservative MPs are demanding more evidence to justify areas of England being put into the higher tiers of Covid restrictions when the lockdown ends next week. Health Secretary Matt Hancock says the policy is ""necessary to protect the NHS and keep the virus under control"" but Tory backbenchers on the lockdown-sceptical Covid Recovery Group describe it as ""authoritarianism at work"". The government promises to publish an impact assessment before MPs vote next week.
Tougher restrictions are in place across Northern Ireland as a two-week ""circuit breaker"" lockdown takes effect. Non-essential retailers have been told to close to all but click-and-collect trade, with cafes and restaurants restricted to offering take-away and close-contact services, such as beauty salons, barred from opening.
The government has asked its medicines regulator to assess the Oxford/AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine. The referral marks ""a significant first step"" in getting the vaccine ""approved for deployment"", the government says, with AstraZeneca set to have as many as 4 million doses ready for the UK by the end of the year and 40 million by the end of March 2021.
Loneliness among parents of young children has ""dramatically increased"" during the pandemic, suggests research from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's Royal Foundation. The charity gathered views from half a million people in the UK on bringing up children under the age of five and found parents increasingly feeling cut off from support, particularly in more deprived areas.
Much excitement has been generated by positive news relating to vaccine development over the last month. But when will it be widely available? And who will get it first? Ros Atkins examines some of the biggest questions.

Greenland’s early Viking settlers were subjected to rapidly changing climate. Temperatures plunged several degrees in a span of decades, according to research from Brown University. A reconstruction of 5,600 years of climate history from lakes near the Norse settlement in western Greenland also shows how climate affected the Dorset and Saqqaq cultures. Results appear in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

PROVIDENCE, R.I. [from Brown University] — The end of the Norse settlements on Greenland likely will remain shrouded in mystery. While there is scant written evidence of the colony’s demise in the 14th and early 15th centuries, archaeological remains can fill some of the blanks, but not all.
What climate scientists have been able to ascertain is that an extended cold snap, called the Little Ice Age, gripped Greenland beginning in the 1400s. This has been cited as a major cause of the Norse’s disappearance. Now researchers led by Brown University show the climate turned colder in an earlier span of several decades, setting in motion the end of the Greenland Norse. Their findings appear in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
The Brown scientists’ finding comes from the first reconstruction of 5,600 years of climate history from two lakes in Kangerlussuaq, near the Norse “Western Settlement.” Unlike ice cores taken from the Greenland ice sheet hundreds of miles inland, the new lake core measurements reflect air temperatures where the Vikings lived, as well as those experienced by the Saqqaq and the Dorset, Stone Age cultures that preceded them.

“This is the first quantitative temperature record from the area they were living in,” said William D’Andrea, the paper’s first author, who earned his doctorate in geological sciences at Brown and is now a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Massachusetts–Amherst. “So we can say there is a definite cooling trend in the region right before the Norse disappear.”
“The record shows how quickly temperature changed in the region and by how much,” said co-author Yongsong Huang, professor of geological sciences at Brown, principal investigator of the NSF-funded project, and D’Andrea’s Ph.D. adviser. “It is interesting to consider how rapid climate change may have impacted past societies, particularly in light of the rapid changes taking place today.”
D’Andrea points out that climate is not the only factor in the demise of the Norse Western Settlement. The Vikings’ sedentary lifestyle, reliance on agriculture and livestock for food, dependence on trade with Scandinavia and combative relations with the neighboring Inuit, are believed to be contributing factors.
Still, it appears that climate played a significant role. The Vikings arrived in Greenland in the 980s, establishing a string of small communities along Greenland’s west coast. (Another grouping of communities, called the “Eastern Settlement” also was located on the west coast but farther south on the island.) The arrival coincided with a time of relatively mild weather, similar to that in Greenland today. However, beginning around 1100, the climate began an 80-year period in which temperatures dropped 4 degrees Celsius (7 degrees Fahrenheit), the Brown scientists concluded from the lake readings. While that may not be considered precipitous, especially in the summer, the change could have ushered in a number of hazards, including shorter crop-growing seasons, less available food for livestock and more sea ice that may have blocked trade.
“You have an interval when the summers are long and balmy and you build up the size of your farm, and then suddenly year after year, you go into this cooling trend, and the summers are getting shorter and colder and you can’t make as much hay. You can imagine how that particular lifestyle may not be able to make it,” D’Andrea said.
Archaeological and written records show the Western Settlement persisted until sometime around the mid-1300s. The Eastern Settlement is believed to have vanished in the first two decades of the 1400s.
The researchers also examined how climate affected the Saqqaq and Dorset peoples. The Saqqaq arrived in Greenland around 2500 B.C. While there were warm and cold swings in temperature for centuries after their arrival, the climate took a turn for the bitter beginning roughly 850 B.C., the scientists found. “There is a major climate shift at this time,” D’Andrea said. “It seems that it’s not as much the speed of the cooling as the amplitude of the cooling. It gets much colder.”
The Saqqaq exit coincides with the arrival of the Dorset people, who were more accustomed to hunting from the sea ice that would have accumulated with the colder climate at the time. Yet by around 50 B.C., the Dorset culture was waning in western Greenland, despite its affinity for cold weather. “It is possible that it got so cold they left, but there has to be more to it than that,” D’Andrea said.
Contributing authors include Sherilyn Fritz from the University of Nebraska–Lincoln and N. John Anderson from Loughborough University in the United Kingdom. The National Science Foundation funded the work.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt seems the more Dr. Michael E. Mann opens his mouth, the more he makes himself look like a total jackass. To make things worse, even his own lawyer somehow convinced him to file a baseless lawsuit, and so will end up raking in poor Mike’s money. Today the affair has become a comedy that has the audience rolling on the floor with laughter.
In the latest development, in what appears to be peculiar attempt to give himself gravitas, the insecure Dr. Mann claimed in his suit that he had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his contribution as an IPCC scientist, when the Nobel Committee awarded the prize to the IPCC and Al Gore in 2007.
That claim is false. Just how did he try to pull it off? Easy: he used Mike’s Nobel Trick. It goes as follows:
1) Take the diploma awarded to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2007.

2. Next, simply splice on the data you want:

3. And presto! Mike’s Nobel Trick produces a genuine looking Nobel Peace Prize for your own personal use!

With it you’ll be respected, be able to influence policymakers, and feel really important.
Just be sure to hide it. If anyone asks to see the original, just tell them you lost it, or that it’s available only to other Nobel prize winners, or that it’s not subject to the FOIA, or that you don’t have permission to share it.
By now we have to start feeling sorry for the poor guy. Disgraced and humiliated again.

"Monday May 27 was a public holiday in the UK, the fourth such “bank holiday” in the past six weeks. On each of these days, people made fewer commutes, they left their computers and machines switched off, and the country generally used less energy.  In fact, my rough calculations below indicate that, depending on the season, each bank holiday could save more than 100,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions.  So let’s conduct a thought experiment in which hypothetically Britain switches overnight to a four-day work week. Would that actually lead to less energy consumption, and fewer emissions? The idea of a four-day week keeps popping up, for various reasons. For instance, an experiment conducted in New Zealand last year showed it boosted productivity levels. But I want to look at the idea of reducing the working week as a tool to fight climate change.  Back in 2006, two economists found that simply changing American working hours to European levels would lower US emissions by at least 7%. The following year, the US state of Utah conducted a test: it switched state employees to a four-day (albeit still 40-hour) work week and found that this led to significant energy savings, mostly because of less need for air conditioning, as well as lower emissions as a result of reduced traffic. In order to estimate energy savings, first we must look at how much is consumed, commonly called the “load”. In the below graph, I have plotted the UK’s total electricity demand on a typical weekday, weekend day and bank holiday, as it changes throughout the day. I used data for every day in 2019 until yesterday (Jan 1 – May 27). This is called a load curve: Throughout the day, total electricity load fluctuates between 20 and 45 gigawatts and the nine to five workday pattern shows up very clearly. Demand is at its absolute peak just before 8pm but the curve has a typical double peak shape, with another one around midday. At the weekends, people tend to get up a couple of hours later, but the maximum energy consumption is still in the early evening – however, overall consumption is lower by 10%.  On the four bank holidays so far in 2019, consumption dropped, on average, by a further 9%. But the variance on these days – that is the “spread” of the data – is much larger. We must therefore look into the seasonal variations. The winter months are colder and darker, so there will usually be more demand for heat and light in January than in May. It therefore makes more sense to compare the two May bank holidays with days in the same month.  However, this year’s early May bank holiday was actually 6% above the average May weekend day in terms of consumption, while the late May bank holiday was around 6% below average. Therefore – based on this very limited sample – one could reasonably argue that these extra days off could be counted as regular weekend days. In terms of consumption, a four-day working week would then effectively mean a three-day weekend, and electricity consumption falls on weekends by around 10%  (this is not far off Utah’s estimate, after adjusting for the difference in actual working hours).  But to estimate the true emissions savings, we must look at the sources of energy production. Coal and natural gas power are obviously very different from wind or solar, and the availability and cost of the various energy sources changes throughout the day. The rule of thumb here is that at higher overall levels of electricity demand, more of that electricity will be generated from fossil fuels. That is because the EU mandates that cleaner energy sources be used first. While this rule might change in the near future, for now it means that lower electricity demand will mean lower emissions per unit generated. In fact, so far this year, British electricity was on average 17.5% less carbon intensive on weekends than weekdays. All this means that if the UK was to introduce a four-day week, effectively replacing a work day with an extra weekend day, it would potentially reduce energy consumption for that day by 10% and emissions intensity by 17.5%. These two effects add up: the lower electricity consumption of the weekend combines with lower carbon intensity, as there is less need to switch on polluting coal or gas plants, therefore potentially lowering emissions on any given day by 22% in May or 25% in January. In sheer numbers, this would mean saving 82,000 tonnes of CO₂ in May or 146,000 in January. As there are seven days in a week, lowering emissions for one of those days by, on average, 23%, would lead to an overall emissions saving of 3.3%. That’s 110,000 tonnes of CO₂ per week – equivalent to removing 1.2m cars from the road. And as this looks at electricity not petrol, it does not even count the carbon savings from the reduced traffic jams…    Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter.

The Green Party published an advert mocking Simon Bridges and his accent.



The Green Party has deleted an ad attacking Simon Bridges because its members were not happy.  
The ad paints National Party leader Bridges as a used car salesmen at “Simon’s Imports”, using old footage of the National Party leader dubbed by an impersonator highlighting Bridges’ thick accent. 



Hey, I know that many of you don’t like Simon Bridges and that you think he is weak and ineffectual. But isn’t the Green Party the party of the moral high ground? The party that doesn’t get involved in gutter politics? The party that always plays the ball, not the man? **The party that always treats its fellow members in the House with respect,** even if they don’t agree with them?



Yeah, right.



“Oh look, do you like cars, I like cars,” it begins, before mocking Bridges’ climate change policy and low poll ratings.  
 **“Prices are down, emissions are down, my polling is down,” the video says, in the style of a car advertisement.**



Disgraceful. 



Bridges said the ad was amusing and it showed National’s attacks on the [Government’s feebate](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/114068301/government-proposes-massive-feebate-car-scheme-that-would-make-cleaner-cars-up-to-8k-cheaper-and-dirtier-cars-more-expensive) scheme to lower emissions were working.   
“The reality is, we’re holding the Government to account on their taxing of New Zealanders, they’re holding me to account on my accent”.  
He drew attention to the fact Labour [had also rolled-out its first attack ads](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/114424810/jacinda-ardern-remains-relentlessly-positive-despite-negative-facebook-ad-about-simon-bridges) since the election this Parliament.   
**Green Party co-leader James Shaw, who authorised the ad said other people hadn’t found the ad as funny as him.**



Good on Simon for taking it in his stride. I really don’t like the Greens, but James Shaw is the one that everyone holds up as the good guy. Well, he just lost that title as well.



Earlier on Tuesday, he told media the ad highlighted National’s own negative campaigning in a funny way.   
Shaw said it used humour to call attention to National’s ads, which he likened to those used by Donald Trump’s campaign during the 2016 US Presidential election.   
“We’re being meta about it,” he said.   
**Shaw said the party was not trying to mock Bridges’ accent.**



Errr… yes, you were James. How could you be doing anything else?



 **“We had to hire an actor who could accurately depict his accent,” he said.**  
His fellow co-leader Marama Davidson said the ad was “quite funny”, and agreed the party was not trying to mock Bridges’ accent. 



But you hired an actor who could accurately depict his accent…



The nastiness of this government continues. In the meantime, watch out for another puff piece about our Dear Leader tomorrow. There is a poll due out this weekend.

"**The mayor of Leicester has apologised for ""an error of judgement"" after it was revealed he broke lockdown rules twice by visiting his partner.**
Sir Peter Soulsby admitted visiting Lesley Summerland and staying at her house overnight before government guidelines allowed it.
The Sun on Sunday published pictures of the former Leicester South MP fitting a window to Ms Summerland's home.
Sir Peter said ""far more influential people"" had flouted the lockdown rules.
At the beginning of lockdown, England's deputy chief medical officer warned against partners living in separate households meeting up.
For that reason, Dr Jenny Harries said couples might wish to consider testing ""their strength of feeling"" and moving in together during lockdown.
However, Sir Peter, a 71-year-old Labour politician, said that would not have been practical as he was continuing to work and his partner of five years needed to be ""available to support her family"".
The widower said the couple had been separated for five weeks but then ""Lesley became ill"" with a recurring condition that was not related to coronavirus.
He said he spent three nights at her home at the end of April - the peak of the pandemic so far in the UK.
He spent a further four nights to ""secure the property"" by fixing a window at the front of her house in May.
Speaking to BBC Radio Leicester, he said he apologised for the error of judgement and admitted ""it was setting a very bad example"".
However, he added: ""I don't think anybody would claim that there was anything in my behaviour that ran any risk whatsoever of spreading the virus.
""It can be certainly interpreted as against the spirit of the lockdown, if not against the regulations.""
He said he had been ""ready to apologise"" unlike ""some of the high-profile people who are far more influential in setting policy about this than I am"".
In March, Sir Peter reiterated government advice by telling residents to stay at home and only go to work if their job was considered essential.
Leicestershire Police said officers spoke to Sir Peter at a police station yesterday and ""advice was given in relation to the government guidelines"".
The force said since the allegations related to potential historical breaches of lockdown restrictions, no further police action would be taken.
It said the decision was ""in keeping"" with how any report of a historical breach would be dealt with.
Leicester Conservatives described Sir Peter's breach of the regulations as ""clear hypocrisy"" and called on councillors and MPs to demand his resignation.
City councillor Lindsay Broadwell, Labour, also tweeted: ""This merits a resignation in my book.""
Sir Peter said he hoped his fellow councillors did not ""rush to judgement"".

"Curious Kids is a series by The Conversation, which gives children of all ages the chance to have their questions about the world answered by experts. All questions are welcome: you or an adult can send them – along with your name, age and town or city where you live – to curiouskids@theconversation.com. We won’t be able to answer every question, but we’ll do our best. Is global warming heating up the Earth? - Raphael, aged 11, Auckland, New Zealand. The simple answer to this important question is “yes”. We know that both the planet’s air and its oceans have been getting warmer over the last 100 years or more. We know this because it has been measured directly, by weather scientists called “meteorologists”.  Almost all parts of the world have reliable weather records going back many years. These records have been used for a long time to describe and explain what “normal” weather is like around the world. But more recently, they have shown how “normal” weather has changed over time.  Of course, the weather changes a lot naturally; from season to season, and day to day. But we know what sort of patterns to expect. For example, we know it’s cold in winter and warm in summer.  These patterns are what we call the “climate”: normal weather, plus its daily and seasonal differences.  So when scientists talk about “climate change”, they mean important and out-of-the-ordinary changes to normal weather. This includes extreme weather like storms, floods, droughts and heatwaves happening more often.  The weather records tell us that the 20 warmest years on record all happened in the past 22 years. They also tell us that no one under the age of 34 has lived through a single month which was colder than “normal”.  The obvious question is: why is this happening? Scientists know that the Earth has gone through periods long ago when it’s been warmer or cooler than it is now. But the chances of the recent run of warm years happening naturally is very, very small.  We know that, because it’s never been measured before: the last 30 years has probably been the warmest period of the last 1,400 years. The only way to explain the steady warming of the past century, and especially the faster warming in the past 30 years, is through the effect of human activity. Fuels such as coal and oil are burned to power cars, trucks, trains and aeroplanes; to run offices, farms and factories; to heat and light homes.  These fuels are made from a material called carbon, and when they are burned, they make a gas called carbon dioxide. This gas escapes into the atmosphere and stays there for a long time, maybe even hundreds of years.  Science experiments have shown that this carbon dioxide gas is good at trapping heat, so when there’s more of it in the air, the world warms up. About half of all the carbon dioxide that’s ever come from burning carbon fuels was created in the last 30 years, which is also when the fastest warming has happened. The effects of warming temperatures can already be seen in many ways around the world. Unfortunately, most of these effects cause trouble for people.  More frequent and longer-lasting droughts and heatwaves are likely, which will make it hard for people working outside in jobs like farming or construction. And it will probably be harder to grow food crops in drier soils.  In cold places like the Arctic, the warming climate melts extra snow and ice, adding water to the oceans that will cause the sea to eat away at many coasts.  In the world’s high mountain ranges, melting snow and ice make water, which flows into major rivers. But this river water will eventually be lost, as the weather gets warmer and there’s less and less snow and ice.  Many of these changes will make life harder for people, who may then want or need to leave their homes and move to other places.  It’s easy to feel unhappy, thinking about the effects of global warming. But it’s really important to remember that the future isn’t fixed: what eventually happens is up to us. If we make changes – for example, by using renewable energy and wasting less food – we can change the future for the better.

An Auckland couple were given 90 days notice 4 days before the July 1st deadline for higher levels of insulation, because the landlord had not completed the work on time. 



Unfortunately, if the landlord had not completed the work on time, he had no choice. It is now illegal to have tenants in a rental property where the insulation does not meet the new legal standards, **and the tenant can demand a payment of $4000 for failure to comply.**



Please note that the payment goes to the tenant, not the government. 



A couple who were evicted from their home of 10 years four days before new rules to make rental properties warmer and drier came into effect are considering legal action against their landlord.



On Thursday, the pair from Henderson in West Auckland received a letter saying they had to leave the house within 90 days so the homeowner could renovate it to meet insulation standards.



Landlords had until Monday to ensure their rental properties met the standards, which require that rental properties must have underfloor and ceiling insulation. Those who have failed to comply with the regulations can be forced to pay their tenants up to $4000. 



The wife said the house had been in a state of disrepair for some time – they had put buckets out every time it rained because the roof leaked, but multiple property managers had overlooked the issues. 



They were still living there, though. Why? Because the rent reflected the state of the property, and the few rentals available.



“I have to say, we feel pretty gutted about it all.”  
To make matters worse, the woman’s husband, who is in his 70s, has heart problems and the couple doubted they could find suitable rental accommodation in their price range because they have dogs. 



So, they have dogs, they are on a limited income, so they are not in a great position. Nevertheless, the offer to dob in the landlord was just too tempting.



 **They planned to ask for the $4000 from their landlord because the landlord had failed to bring the property up to standard by the July 1 deadline and would then look at legal action.**



Phil Twyford is trying to push a law that says that landlords cannot just evict tenants without a good reason (although failing to bring a property up to the required legal standard in time must qualify as a good reason) but this has not happened yet. In other words, the landlord is within his rights to give the tenant notice… and it is likely that there is nothing that they can do about it. Yet.



Auckland Tenants’ Protection Association co-ordinator Angela Maynard said kicking tenants out to avoid complying with the law seemed like “a rather stupid idea” for landlords.  
She believed tenants who had been evicted over the standards could file an application with the Tenancy Tribunal for retaliatory notice.  
A retaliatory notice is where a landlord issues a tenant with an eviction notice in retaliation to a tenant standing up for their rights. 



  
This will be an interesting case if it does ever get to court. **A landlord is not allowed to have tenants living in a property that is not compliant.** In this case, it seems that the landlord has opted to do a number of renovations at the same time… but didn’t want to risk being fined $4000 for non compliance.



He had obviously read his tenants well.



Yesterday, I was in my favourite Asian store, buying multiple boxes of Chinese teabags. Normally, of course, they would give me a plastic bag. They didn’t offer one, but I had momentarily forgotten about the total ban. I almost asked for one… and then stopped. The last thing I would want would be to get them into trouble for trying to look after their customers, in case there was a climate Nazi in the queue behind me. So I left the store, juggling boxes of teabags, reminding myself for the millionth time to bring bags when I go shopping.



What I don’t like here is the insidious attitude in these policies, both of which came in on the same day, that the authorities will do nothing, but instead will rely on people dobbing in errant landlords and errant shopkeepers.



 **Since when did we live in a society where people dobbed in others to the authorities, for relatively minor infringements – particularly the plastic bags?**



This government is pitching ordinary people against each other. Just like China under Chairman Mao, or Russia under Stalin, we can now dob in people we don’t like, even if they have done nothing wrong. What is stopping one of the other Asian stores in Lower Hutt from dobbing in one of the others, just to ruin their business?



All of this sounds like the Stasi to me.



What do you think, Comrade?

"Antarctica is further from civilisation than any other place on Earth. The Greenland ice sheet is closer to home but around one tenth the size of its southern sibling. Together, these two ice masses hold enough frozen water to raise global mean sea level by 65 metres if they were to suddenly melt. But how likely is this to happen? The Antarctic ice sheet is around one and half times larger than Australia. What’s happening in one part of Antarctica may not be the same as what’s happening in another – just like the east and west coasts of the US can experience very different responses to, for example, a change in the El Niño weather pattern. These are periodic climate events that result in wetter conditions across the southern US, warmer conditions in the north and drier weather on the north-eastern seaboard.  The ice in Antarctica is nearly 5km thick in places and we have very little idea what the conditions are like at the base, even though those conditions play a key role in determining the speed with which the ice can respond to climate change, including how fast it can flow toward and into the ocean. A warm, wet base lubricates the bedrock of land beneath the ice and allows it to slide over it. These issues have made it particularly difficult to produce model simulations of how ice sheets will respond to climate change in future. Models have to capture all the processes and uncertainties that we know about and those that we don’t – the “known unknowns” and the “unknown unknowns” as Donald Rumsfeld once put it. As a result, several recent studies suggest that previous Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports may have underestimated how much melting ice sheets will contribute to sea level in future. Fortunately, models are not the only tools for predicting the future. Structured Expert Judgement is a method from a study one of us published in 2013. Experts give their judgement on a hard-to-model problem and their judgements are combined in a way that takes into account how good they are at assessing their own uncertainty. This provides a rational consensus. The approach has been used when the consequences of an event are potentially catastrophic, but our ability to model the system is poor. These include volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, the spread of vector-borne diseases such as malaria and even aeroplane crashes.  Since the study in 2013, scientists modelling ice sheets have improved their models by trying to incorporate processes that cause positive and negative feedback. Impurities on the surface of the Greenland ice sheet cause positive feedback as they enhance melting by absorbing more of the sun’s heat. The stabilising effect of bedrock rising as the overlying ice thins, lessening the weight on the bed, is an example of negative feedback, as it slows the rate that the ice melts.  The record of observations of ice sheet change, primarily from satellite data, has also grown in length and quality, helping to improve knowledge of the recent behaviour of the ice sheets. With colleagues from the UK and US, we undertook a new Structured Expert Judgement exercise. With all the new research, data and knowledge, you might expect the uncertainties around how much ice sheet melting will contribute to sea level rise to have got smaller. Unfortunately, that’s not what we found. What we did find was a range of future outcomes that go from bad to worse. We gathered together 22 experts in the US and UK in 2018 and combined their judgements. The results are sobering. Rather than a shrinking in the uncertainty of future ice sheet behaviour over the last six years, it has grown. If the global temperature increase stays below 2°C, the experts’ best estimate of the average contribution of the ice sheets to sea level was 26cm. They concluded, however, that there is a 5% chance that the contribution could be as much as 80cm.  If this is combined with the two other main factors that influence sea level – glaciers melting around the world and the expansion of ocean water as it warms – then global mean sea level rise could exceed one metre by 2100. If this were to occur, many small island states would experience their current once-in-a-hundred–year flood every other day and become effectively uninhabitable. For a climate change scenario closer to business as usual – where our current trajectory for economic growth continues and global temperatures increase by 5℃ – the outlook is even more bleak. The experts’ best estimate average in this case is 51cm of sea level rise caused by melting ice sheets by 2100, but with a 5% chance that global sea level rise could exceed two metres by 2100. That has the potential to displace some 200m people.  Let’s try and put this into context. The Syrian refugee crisis is estimated to have caused about a million people to migrate to Europe. This occurred over years rather than a century, giving much less time for countries to adjust. Still, sea level rise driven by migration of this size might threaten the existence of nation states and result in unimaginable stress on resources and space. There is time to change course, but not much, and the longer we delay the harder it gets, the bigger the mountain we have to climb. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter.

"**A business is hoping to revamp hundreds of used bikes to be given as Christmas presents to children of families hit by the coronavirus pandemic.**
The family-run Staffordshire Waste Recycling Centre has given away about 60 cycles since setting up its recycle project, Bikes for Life, this month.
Phil Preece, from the Stoke-on-Trent firm, said: ""It is a joy when you see a child come and select a cycle.""
His son Calvin added the city had been ""hard hit"" by the pandemic.
""It is not a wealthy area and obviously now being stuck in tier three is really going to put demands on people,"" he said.
He was ""shocked"" by the poverty in the city when he saw people ""queuing up for food parcels"" when the firm helped community group Middleport Matters deliver food earlier this year.
""It's heartbreaking really,"" he said.
""I've got children myself and I would hate to think that I couldn't get them a bike, but some children will get nothing this year.""
He hoped the project, which will also donate bikes to adults and scooters, will ""carry on"" into 2021.
They have also had requests from about 20 children's homes, charities and refuges and hope to donate 600 bikes by Christmas.
About 180 bikes have been donated so far with most needing ""a few bits and bobs done"" or a clean-up, he said. Many had been left in garages after children had outgrown them.

Share this...FacebookTwitterInternational Doubt Over The Success Of Germany’s Energiewende growing
by Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
Germany’s Energiewende [energy transition over to renewables] is being watched closely in foreign countries. Already bets are being made on whether the expensive experiment is going to work. Meanwhile increasing numbers of international experts are expressing serious doubts. In the March 20th print edition of German national daily Die Welt, Daniel Wetzel reports on a survey by the World Energy Council in an article titled “The Energiewende is an international flop”. An online version of the report is now available and bears the watered down title: “Other countries disdaining the Energiewende”:
Worldwide doubt about the success of the German Energiewende is growing. International experts are sure that the German economy is weakening. This is the finding of a survey from the World Energy Council. […] A rapid short-term shutdown of nuclear power plants along with unlimited subsidies for renewable energies: In Germany this has been viewed as the silver bullet for energy policy since the Fukushima accident. However in Europe and globally, there’s hardly a nation that views the German ‘Energiewende”’ as worth copying. These are the findings of the German section of the World Energy Council in 23 member countries, made exclusively available to Die Welt. […] The rising doubt is possibly related to the unexpectedly rapidly rising electricity prices in Germany, which are having a dissuasive effect. Stotz believes: ‘Obviously one has to be able to afford an energy transition.’ (Read more at Welt Online).

In a commentary appearing at Die Welt titled, “Germany, the odd one out”, Daniel Wetzel pleads for more prudence, and rejects climate alarmism as the most important argument for an Energiewende:

Also the necessity to rapidly end the use of fossil fuels no longer appears as urgent as it was just a few years ago. Indeed, in the meantime, fear of climate change appears to have evaporated worldwide. Global warming has been taking a break for over 10 years, and politicians in many countries appear as if they would rather await a good explanation for this phenomenon before again making the fight against climate change a high priority. Quite apart from this: one other large industrial country has just succeeded in reducing its per capita CO2 emissions to levels of the early 1960s. The best in the class when it comes to climate politics is the USA. Thanks to fracking technology in natural gas drilling, they have been able to switch off dirty coal power plants.”

The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and the ensuing political firestorm brought to the fore some longstanding problems associated with the regulation of commercial activities of all kinds on federal lands. Unfortunately, those problems are not resolvable as long as the lands are governed by federal agents. Populist outcries against the “giveaway” of oil on public lands and the industry’s refusal to drill even when leases are granted demonstrate the difficulty economists face when trying to construct a rational public lands management regime. The only promising avenue of reform is to privatize commercially attractive federal lands and institute a strict liability regime for damage to third parties in lieu of regulatory oversight. If privatization is too politically difficult to achieve, a second‐​best remedy would be to replace royalty payments for production with a one‐​time fee for use.



Unfortunately, the Democratic reform proposals fail to address the underlying problems that have contributed to regulatory dysfunction. Worse, they veer off into tangential campaigns against foreign oil imports, oil consumption, and climate change. Examination of both President Obama’s reform proposals and the main piece of Democratic legislation designed to address the spill — the American Clean Energy and Security Act (the so‐​called Waxman–Markey Bill) — suggest that the spill is being used as a pretext to advance dubious policy agendas that have little to do with the spill itself.

"**A new public garden is to be created in east London to commemorate key workers and those who have lost their lives to Covid-19.**
The space in Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park will feature 33 blossoming trees, to represent the different boroughs.
The species of trees have been chosen in particular because this year's blossom season coincided with the start of the first lockdown.
London's mayor said it would be a space where people could ""reflect"".
The Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, in Stratford, was originally built for the 2012 London Olympics and has been further developed into a public space since.
The trees will be planted in three rings in the north of the park early next year.
Sadiq Khan said it would be ""a permanent reminder of the lives that have been lost, a tribute to every single key worker, and a symbol of how Londoners have stood together to help one another"".
City Hall is working with the National Trust and Bloomberg to create the ""lasting living memorial""."

There are no clouds in the central Oregon sky today, but we are nonetheless living in dim times. With active wildfires on all sides of my home, we have some of the worst air pollution in the world.



It’s hard not to feel apocalyptic right now. In just four days, around 3 percent of western Oregon has burned, destroying hundreds of homes and other structures and forcing 80,000 people to evacuate. The good news is that it was not 500,000 people as reported in the media, but still, 80,000 is a lot, and many no longer have homes to return to.



I’ve been monitoring wildland fire policy for more than two decades, and this is the worst I have lived through. Still, this is far from a record year: though there have been lots of fires in the Northwest and northern California, fires are below average in southern California and much of the rest of the country.



One reason why we have seen bigger fires in recent years is that the Forest Service and other agencies have changed their firefighting tactics. For example, the Beachie Creek Fire near us was started by lightning on August 16. Located in a steep, inaccessible part of the Willamette National Forest, it smoldered on about 10 acres for ten days or so, then slowly increased over the following ten days to around 775 acres, then blew up, burning 132,000 acres in one ten‐​hour period–meaning it torched three acres per second–destroying hundreds of homes and killing at least two people.



A few decades ago, the Forest Service would have dropped smokejumpers by parachute on August 16 or 17 and had them directly attack the fire. But too many burnovers killing entire crews has rightly made the agency more protective of the lives of on‐​the‐​ground firefighters. Instead, it risks the lives of helicopter and air tanker pilots, five of whom have already died this year, having them dump water and fire retardant on the fires. During three weeks, they spent well over a million dollars doing this on the Beachie Creek Fire with dubious results.



Even when fires don’t escape, the tactics today emphasize indirect attack, meaning backfires, instead of direct attack. The result is that far more acres are burned, many of them lit by the firefighters themselves. Thus, based on acres burned, we can’t really draw conclusions about whether climate change or other factors beyond our control is resulting in more fires.



There are several major schools of thought about fire policy. One is that climate change has made fires worse and so we need to stop using fossil fuels and completely change our lifestyles to reverse this. I don’t buy this, as both the historic and prehistoric record (using things like soil profiles and tree ring analysis) indicate that an average of about 1 percent of the West has burned every year for thousands of years. After accounting for changes in firefighting tactics, I don’t see any indication that more acres are burning today because of climate change.



(On the other hand, and contrary to many climate‐​skeptic web sites, we can’t use the historic fire record to conclude that climate change isn’t happening either. The record shows that far more acres burned in the 1930s and 1940s than in the last few decades. What the record doesn’t say is that, in those years, the Forest Service opposed prescribed burning, which was widely practiced in the South, so it spitefully counted all acres of prescribed burning as wildfires.)



A second school of thought is that the 75 percent reduction in federal land timber sales between 1990 and 2000 is the problem, and if only we could increase timber cutting the forests would be healthier. The difficulty with this view is that timber cutting actually leaves forests more vulnerable to fire as it removes the big wood that isn’t very flammable and brings the fine wood and needles down from high in the air to the ground, where it is very flammable.



A third school of thought is that more than a century of fire suppression has allowed fuels to build up in the forests, making them more vulnerable to fire. This school calls for widespread fuel treatments, either physically removing the brush and small trees or burning them in place. In fact, wildland firefighting was never successful enough to have a significant impact on forest fuels. A Forest Service report several years ago concluded that the vast majority of western forests have not been ecologically changed by fire suppression.



The Forest Service currently spends $430 million a year on fuel treatments and Department of Interior and state agencies spend even more. Yet all the fuel treatments in the world aren’t going to save your house if firebrands from a lightning‐​caused fire seven miles away are blown by 50 mile‐​an‐​hour winds to your cedar‐​shake roof, which is what happened to many homes in Oregon last Monday.



My own view is that people in the West have to recognize that we live in a fire zone where roughly 1 percent of the natural landscape is going to burn each year no matter what we do. Instead of blaming these fires on public or private forest managers, we need to take responsibility to protect our own property and not rely on the Forest Service or other adjacent landowners to protect us.



That means the roofs and other parts of our our homes and other structures must be made of fireproof materials such as asphalt shingles, not cedar shakes. The walls can be wood, but our landscaping needs to follow defensible space or firewise principles so that, if it catches fire, it won’t generate enough heat to light structures on fire. The homes themselves should be at least 100 and preferably 150 feet apart so that, if one catches fire, the radiant heat from that fire doesn’t light up its neighbors.



Research by Forest Service fire scientist Jack Cohen has shown that such defensible space is both necessary and sufficient to protect structures from wildfire. It’s necessary because all the prescribed burning in the world won’t save your home if a burning ember from a lightning‐​caused fire 8 miles away lands on your lovely cedar‐​shake roof. It’s sufficient because it will protect your home even if neighboring forest landowners don’t do any prescribed burning or other fuel treatments at all.



This also means changing land‐​use policies adopted in California and other western states that promote dense housing. Urban‐​growth boundaries and zoning codes that mandate numerous homes on each acre even on urban fringes are asking for those homes to burn in wildfires. Cities need a buffer of low‐​density homes on one‐​acre lots to protect them from wildfires, and the lack of such a buffer is one reason why so many homes in Napa and other northern California counties have burned in the last few years.



If all homes and other structures in the wildland‐​urban interface met defensible‐​space standards, much of the $430 million that the Forest Service spends each year on hazardous fuels would not be needed, nor would much of the $2.5 billion or more that it spends on fire suppression.



Incidentally, the evacuation of 80,000 Oregonians should also alert transportation planners of the importance of having a good road network. Too many states and cities are trying to reduce road capacities. It’s called a “road diet” and it makes key evacuation routes unnecessarily congested. In 2018, a road diet in Paradise, California was blamed for the deaths of several people who were burned in their cars when they were stuck in traffic.



Before the Beachie Creek Fire blew up, the Forest Service posted a photo of two agency employees watching helicopters ineffectually dump water on the fire. The photo was titled “A Teachable Moment.” I hope the lesson we learned is that we need to take care of our own property and not depend on the government to protect us from natural wildfires that are beyond anyone’s control.

"The state of the British summer has always been a constant source of fascination and irritation, if only for its fickle nature. Now the latest prediction is for more heavy summer downpours. Our study, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, shows the first evidence that summer downpours in the UK could become heavier with climate change. We used a very high-resolution model more typically used for weather forecasting to study changes in hourly rainfall. Unlike current climate models, this has a fine resolution and is able to realistically represent hourly rainfall, so this allows us to make these future projections with some confidence.  What we found was that summers are likely to become drier overall by 2100, in a warming climate. But our results suggest that when it does rain, it will be heavier in short outbreaks. In particular, intense rainfall with the potential to cause serious flash flooding (more than 30mm in an hour) could become a more common occurrence, increasing in frequency by several times. What the study provides is a much more complete picture of how UK rainfall may change in the future. Climate models generally work at coarse resolutions, using grids of around 12km square or larger. These have been able to accurately simulate winter rainfall, which generally comes from sustained, long-lasting periods of rain from large-scale weather systems. These models point toward wetter winters, with the potential for greater daily rainfall in the future. But summer weather is harder to predict using such coarse models. It is changes on an hourly basis that are important, as rainfall tends to come in short but intense bursts during the summer – as seen during the Boscastle flooding of 2004 and “Toon Flood” in Newcastle in 2012. So far climate models have lacked the resolution to accurately simulate the smaller-scale convective storms (intense showers formed by rising air) which cause this type of rain. To deal with this issue, our study uses the most high-resolution model ever used before in long climate simulations to examine rainfall change, based on a 1.5km square grid (the same as the UK Met Office Weather Forecast model), leading to much higher accuracy. We ran this model to simulate two 13-year periods, one based on the current climate and one based on the climate at the end of the century under a high-emissions scenario (the IPCC’s RCP8.5 scenario). The simulations were so computationally intensive that it took the Met Office’s supercomputer – one of the world’s most powerful – about nine months to run the simulations, and even then we could only run the model for the southern half of the UK, about as far north as Manchester. The simulation showed increased hourly rainfall intensity during winter, consistent with the simulations for the future provided by coarser resolution models and previous studies looking at changes on daily timescales. However the finely grained model also revealed that short-duration rain will become more intense during summer, something that the coarser model was unable to simulate. This finding is of major importance due to the potential for flooding: a threshold of 30mm per hour is used by the Met Office and Environment Agency Flood Forecasting Centre as guidance to indicate likely flash flooding, and our results suggest this may be exceeded more often (up to five times) and over a wider area in the future. Our findings are only the results of one climate model and we need to wait for other centres to run similarly detailed simulations to see whether their results support these findings. However, an increase in summer storms in a warmer, moister environment is consistent with theoretical expectations, and with the limited observational studies we have of hourly rainfall to date. This work is part of the joint Met Office and NERC-funded CONVEX project. The next steps are to see if the results are consistent with observations and predictions of hourly rainfall from climate models in other parts of the world, to be undertaken by the European Research Council-funded INTENSE project jointly run by Newcastle University academics in collaboration with the UK Met Office and other leading international scientists."

There is a news article on March 29 2011 from Rueters titled
Aircraft  condensation trails criss-crossing the sky may be warming the planet on  a normal day more than the carbon dioxide emitted by all planes since  the Wright Brothers’ first flight in 1903, a study said on Tuesday.
The text begins with [highlight added]

“Aircraft condensation trails criss-crossing the  sky may be warming the planet on a normal day more than the carbon  dioxide emitted by all planes since the Wright Brothers’ first flight in  1903, a study said on Tuesday.”
Another excerpt reads
“The study, by experts at the DLR German Aerospace  Center, estimated that the net warming effect for the Earth of  contrails and related cirrus clouds at any one time was 31  milliwatts per square meter, more than the warming effect of accumulated  CO2 from aviation of 28 milliwatts.”
If correct, this is a remarkable finding with respect to  contrails as a climate forcing. It also shows that as we study the  climate system, we find it is affected by a wider diversity of human  climate forcings than concluded by the IPCC. The human effect on the  climate system is not dominated by CO2 and a few other greenhouse gases.

"**The Government of Jersey has been given the power by the States Assembly to make wearing masks in shops mandatory.**
Members also approved laws to limit the size of gatherings, as part of updated Covid-19 regulations.
Currently the wearing of masks is not legally enforceable, with the government continuing to promote them in guidance.
The regulations have not created new rules, rather they have set the terms of possible restrictions.
The maximum penalty for individuals breaching any mask or gathering law would be set at Â£1,000.
Children under 12 years old would not have to wear a mask, along with people exempt for health or disability reasons, according to the regulations.
If a law requiring wearing of face coverings is introduced, it would apply to specific workplaces where a member of the public is present as a customer.
The regulations also allow orders to oblige businesses to collect personal data to aid contact tracing and to refuse service to those not wearing masks.
Any restrictions on the size of gatherings will only apply to groups of 10 or more people.
Visiting people's homes in Jersey was banned during the first wave of the pandemic before the ban was lifted in May, although public health guidance has discouraged meeting indoors since."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThis week’s newsstand, print-edition of FOCUS magazine (February 25, 2013, No. 9/13) has a 2-page interview with leading German climate scientist Professor Hans von Storch (HvS) titled: Climate Scientist Against Panic Spreading.

Hans von Storch
The sub-heading of the FOCUS article on page 92 reads:
Scientist Hans von Storch goes hard in his own way: He accuses climate science of hype and ‘methodical failure’.”
Here he is speaking about the IPCC scientists. The interview coincides with the official release of his latest book “Klimafalle“, which will hit the bookshelves tomorrow.
HvS says the focus of the climate issue is too much on the alarmists and those who claim it’s all humbug. His book attempts to move the discussion to the centre.
There’s little doubt that man-made CO2 emissions have caused the globe to warm since the industrial revolution, he tells FOCUS, but not all scientists say sea levels are going to rise 2 meters by the year 2100 and that hurricanes are getting more frequent.
He says the climate issue needs to be debated, and warns scientists against acting like they are the “keepers of the truth”.
At the center of the magazine’s 2-page spread are two juxtaposed images: the left one shows the divergence between the observed global mean temperature and the IPCC projections; the right image shows Chancellor Angela Merkel with Prof Han-Joachim Schellnhuber standing in the background. The text under the juxtaposed images reads “indeed the global mean temperature has stagnated for years” and that HvS’s book Die Klimafälle “criticises the alarmist view of the PIK” (Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research).
HvS has always been critical of scientists interfering in the political process. FOCUS asks HvS if Chancellor Merkel ought not have a climate advisor, to which HvS replies:



<!--
google_ad_client = ""ca-pub-3545577860068042"";
/* neu test */
google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";
google_ad_width = 200;
google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




Just a single advisor? No.”
FOCUS then asks HvS about efforts by scientists to intimidate any media critical of alarmism, a practice Stefan Rahmstorf is infamous for:
That is a not taking one of the most important institutions seriously, namely the media. Anyone who behaves like that obviously views himself as the judge who knows how media reporting is supposed to be.”
FOCUS then describes the IPCC’s embarrassing Himalayan error, asking HvS how it is that some scientists can claim to be infallible? HvS attributes it to a “circle-the-wagons mentality” within the climate science community, and even blames the political discussion in the USA “which has a very aggressive skeptics’ scene that extends all the way into Congress and has influence on policy-making.”
On the 15-year temperature stagnation, HvS still does not believe it disproves in the AGW theory, but concedes:
As the scientific community, we were just not prepared for the temperature not rising for a decade as CO2 concentrations rose. We had not thought enough about the possibility of falsification. […] We concentrated too much on looking ahead and said: Great! Everything fits our explanation. For many colleagues asking questions was frowned upon because this ‘could provide the climate skeptics with ammo‘. And that is a methodical failure.”
On Mojib Latif’s prediction that Central Europe would soon hardly see snow, HvS says criticism of the models here by skeptics is “completely legitimate” and adds:
Us climate scientists oversold. We said we had to announce the basic truth, and not to overload the people with too many details. Thus the problem arose because climate science did not understand its own role.”
In summary, HvS, a warmist, is calling for a fundamental correction in the way climate science goes about its business.
But one ought not think that HvS criticizes only the alarmists, he has plenty of criticism for the skeptics in his book as well.

"African elephants are threatened with extinction. With numbers shrinking by a third in just seven years, there are now fewer than 350,000 left in the wild. And their dwindling numbers are not just the concern of nature documentaries – they play vital roles in helping plant life prosper, digging water holes and improving foraging conditions for other animals. In 2011, poaching rates hit an all-time high, with 10% of all elephants on the continent killed in a single year. Thankfully, our new research, published in Nature Communications, reveals that the poaching rate has since declined, hovering at around 4% in 2017. However, this drop is not enough – at current levels of poaching, the African elephant could still become near extinct in a few decades. This is despite substantial law enforcement efforts, and legislation to outlaw the trade of ivory. Our results suggest that if we are to save the African elephant, we should begin to direct resources towards less traditional approaches. The drop in poaching from 2011 levels was likely due to a decrease in demand for ivory in China and South-East Asia – but the reasons for this decrease are not obvious. It would be easy to assume that China’s ivory trade ban  and prominent supportive campaigns led by celebrities were responsible, but the dates don’t match up – the trade ban wasn’t announced until 2015 and didn’t take effect until 2017. The ban may have had some positive effect on more recent poaching numbers, and it certainly sends the right political messages. But as demonstrated by the recent growth in rhino poaching despite a comprehensive ban, history tells us that making a coveted animal product illegal doesn’t always curb trade.

      Read more:
      Why China's ivory ban is a mammoth step towards saving the elephant


 Instead, it seems that China’s slowing economy may have been the main driver behind the fall in poaching. And while the subsequent economic squeeze probably reduced ivory demand among the rich in Asia, poaching could easily rise again should China’s economy change. The most important thing we can do to reduce poaching is to stop people setting out to poach in the first place. Traditionally, law enforcement has been seen as the cornerstone of strategies to cut supply,  driving a push for increasingly militarised anti-poaching operations. But while law enforcement did explain some of the large variation in poaching rates across sites, a much bigger correlate of poaching rates was the level of poverty and corruption in the area.  For many involved in poaching in Africa, the ivory from a single large elephant could be sold for much more than they have any chance of earning in an entire year. And given that elephants regularly raid crops and kill community members, even those not involved are often understandably ambivalent about tackling poaching. That’s not to say that we should stop investing in law enforcement. The mere presence of a few rangers deters many poachers, and is an extremely useful strategy. But the most professional poachers will only be deterred by a large, well-trained, and well-equipped field team, which simply isn’t practical in sites that cover ground areas in excess of small European countries. Our results suggest that some of the vast sum of money spent on these types of operations may be better spent on poverty and corruption-related interventions.  Of course, reducing poverty and corruption is no simple task either. Some conservation organisations have tried offering financial incentives to communities for taking an active role in conservation efforts, but these schemes have had mixed results as cash benefits are often small, or not shared equally.  Our results suggest that conservation benefits may result from any reduction in poverty, not just from development schemes that are directly tied to biodiversity. So conservation organisations might seek to invest in, say, the provision of factories that offer appropriate employment to community members, or make grants to community members for new business ideas. The important bonus of this approach is that in addition to being an effective method of reducing poaching, it would place improving the lives of thousands of Africans as a central priority. The well-being of humans and wildlife are not isolated issues. The plight of all species on this planet are intertwined, and the sooner we act accordingly, the better."

A proposed plan to save the planet, an opinion piece on _Stuff_ , is completely backwards facing. Apparently, the only way to save the planet (or at least just Wellington) is to **regress our modern-day** society into a world from the past and to “behave better” – whatever that means.



Now don’t get me wrong, there are parts of the past that I quite, like such as stable nuclear families where children were brought up with both a Mum and a Dad, but other aspects of the past are frankly revolting. I wouldn’t accept regressing to the bad old days where teeth were pulled without anaesthetic and I am not at all keen on going to visit my friends on a bicycle or, even worse, having to walk! Public transport is for other people, not me, thanks, as unless you live in a well-planned city like Melbourne where you can catch a train anywhere easily, public transport is unreliable and generally useless. Just ask any Aucklander.



  
[…] The Wellington city approach mirrors that of many other councils and national government. We will behave better. **We will walk and cycle a lot more, use public transport a lot more.** There will be a big investment in public transport infrastructure. And **we will buy electric cars.**  
  
  
[…] Too often transport-change plans assume that people are just “naughty” and make poor travel choices. All that is needed is exhortation to better behaviours. But from the research I was involved in, my conclusion is that where people live and how they travel is a rational decision made on the basis of the real settings at play. **Exhortation and environmental concern play little part in that choice.**  




Tell me something I don’t know. If public transport is accessible to where people live and takes them to where they want to go on time and efficiently, some of them will use it to take them to work. That is not something that can be created in an existing city. It is not something that can be implemented quickly either. **A city has to be planned before it is even built** , like Melbourne, if public transport is to be of any use whatsoever. It also helps if the city is very flat. 



_THEREFORE, IF WE WANT REAL DRAMATIC CHANGE, WE NEED TO PROVIDE A DRAMATIC CHANGE TO THOSE SETTINGS UNDER WHICH PEOPLE LIVE. WHAT IS NEEDED IS A HIGHLY VIABLE ALTERNATIVE, THAT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED QUICKLY._



 _MY APPROACH FOR THAT ALTERNATIVE IS TO USE OUR EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE IN A MORE EFFECTIVE WAY, SO AVOIDING THE DELAY AND COST OF NEW INFRASTRUCTURE._  
 _WE NEED TO **REPLACE ABOUT 90 PER CENT OF THE 378,000 VEHICLES** THAT MAKE UP THE PRIVATE LIGHT VEHICLE FLEET OF THE WELLINGTON REGION. **WITH THE ROADS NOW CLEARED,** A HIGH-QUALITY PUBLIC TRANSPORT SYSTEM BASED ON ABOUT 1500 BATTERY ELECTRIC BUSES COULD OPERATE VERY EFFECTIVELY._



Now he is just being silly. The rest of his suggestions are all about trying to make buses more efficient and about electric cars replacing the bulk of Wellington’s private car fleet. Of course, if electric cars replace normal cars then **how exactly will that clear the roads?**



  
  
[…] _THE CHANGE **WILL HAVE SOME NEGATIVE IMPACTS,** ESPECIALLY ON THE CAR SUPPORT SECTOR, BUT ALSO MANY BENEFITS, INCLUDING FREEING UP LARGE TRACTS OF CBD AND CBD FRINGE LAND WHICH COULD BE USED FOR INNER CITY LIVING. _



Someone tell him he’s dreaming. Do we really want to cost people jobs just so that some latte-sipping arty types can live in the CBD?



 _[…] SUCH A DRAMATIC CHANGE IN TRANSPORT OBVIOUSLY NEEDS THE AGREEMENT OF THE COMMUNITY, BUT IMPLICIT IN THAT AGREEMENT IS THAT **REMAINING CARS WILL BE THE SECONDARY FORM OF TRANSPORT** AND **RESTRICTED** IN THEIR USE.[…]_



And there we have it. Scratch the surface and we have someone **keen to restrict our freedoms** for the so-called greater good. He will be wanting to turn the motorway into a horse lane next.

When the elites are all singing from the same hymn sheet is precisely the time when ordinary folk should be turning their bullshit detectors right up to 11. “Conventional wisdom” was not coined as a positive description. Instead, as Mark Twain put it, “Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect”.



The same roster of elite finger-waggers and tub-thumpers who regularly flock together in a squawking mass, to tell the rest of us what to think about gay marriage, Brexit, Trump and climate change are congealing once again to try and browbeat Australians into bowing to their superior morality and wisdom on the issue of constitutional recognition and an “Indigenous Voice” to parliament.



Not everyone, least of all among Aboriginal Australians, is buying it.



However, before we debate how, and in what form a ‘Voice’ might be implemented, we need to discuss some important aspects.



The first matter of concern, who was representing me when the all big decisions were being made?



Suspiciously, the very people who are advocating for this dangerous and all-encompassing change were the ones to hand-pick some pet “advisers”.



Going back to 2017 when the First Nations National Constitutional Convention was held at Uluru, the representatives in attendance were invited by nominees of the Referendum Council; and not elected by Indigenous people.



Much of the media attention has ignored the fact that there were and still are dissenting – and unheard – Indigenous voices throughout the entire process…



Well, that’s just silly. Everyone knows that all Aboriginal people think alike, and – purely coincidentally – agree with everything the inner-city green-left says.



Secondly, for far too long Aboriginal people have been portrayed as being one homogenous group of people who all think the same…We don’t have one voice and we never have.



Aboriginal Australia was never a single, united “nation”, but a patchwork of clans, tribes and language groups, all alternately allied or hostile to their neighbours, and all with their own agendas.



To try to put them all in the one basket and to treat them as if they are all the same is a grotesque denial of their rights to see themselves as different and distinct linguistic and cultural groups, with their own distinct histories of contact with Europeans and experience of colonisation.



We would not want to send Tiwi and Warlpiri to Tasmania to sort out their problems for them and we wouldn’t expect Palawa to come to the NT to sort out the problems of remote communities. Each of these groups are the only ones who can solve their own problems in their own unique way.



As journalist Stan Grant has acknowledged, being asked to “identify” as “Indigenous” is being asked to effectively disown half of his family. Enshrining such racial division in the constitution means awarding some family members more or fewer rights than others, purely on the basis of the identity they choose.



And what of our non-Indigenous loved ones and relatives. A clear majority of those who identify as Indigenous now have children with those who don’t. In the southern cities of Sydney and Melbourne, over 80% of Indigenous people are coupled with non-Indigenous partners and have children. Roughly the same percentage of their children identify as Indigenous.



Do our non-Indigenous loved ones have no say in the future of their own children and grandchildren?



There is also the glaring issue of the corruption and mismanagement that plagued previous “Indigenous Voice” organisations like the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, disbanded by bipartisan agreement in 2005. Even today, the lion’s share of “indigenous” funding flows to oddly pale-skinned city dwellers while remote communities remain squalid hell-holes.



Thirdly, as Indigenous people, we all know that those with powerful positions within our communities tend to have most of the resources and most of the control. Those who have managed to take advantage of the plentiful resources available in the Aboriginal industry have done so without effecting much change for the most vulnerable.



Do we imagine that a ‘Voice’ will empower the marginalised or will it entrench those who already maintain control of the resources that flow into Aboriginal disadvantage?…Will yet another bureaucracy such as a legislated ‘Voice’ simply give more power to those who haven’t yet demonstrated that they can solve the critical issues our marginalised Australians are faced with?



  
Or is that actually the point?

It just doesn’t get any better than this. The Occupy Wall Street Mob had a “Climate Justice Day” scheduled for today. I don’t think they figured on a “Nightmare on Wall Street” irony like this.

I notice Bill McKibben isn’t there. Strange how he talks a big game about climate and weather events becoming more extreme, but when the going gets tough… well you know. No mention of this comedic slap in the face by nature on the 350.org website.

"**The government has been criticised over its decision to make the North East of England subject to tier three measures.**
Bars and restaurants will stay closed and can only serve takeaways when the national lockdown ends on 2 December.
Darlington Council leader Heather Scott said it would be difficult to move into tier two within a fortnight, due to week-old data being used to assess Covid rates.
The government said the restrictions were ""essential"" to control the virus.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he understood why people were ""frustrated"" but defended the decision, saying it would drive down the virus until a vaccine is available.
A review will be carried out on 16 December.
""While we were informed... they would look at the numbers once a fortnight, the data is actually a week behind,"" Ms Scott told BBC Radio Tees.
""We only received our tests yesterday [Thursday] so we have got to roll those out and the data will be taken from next week.""
She said she would be delighted if they could get into tier 2,North East tier 3 decision criticised but it will be very difficult.
Hartlepool Council leader Shane Moore said local leaders should have been consulted.
""I think it's disappointing but not a surprise and it's not a surprise because government ministers were itching to put us into tier three before the lockdown, but the difference there was local leaders had a bit of a say in the matter and we were pushing back on it,"" he said.
Joe Franks, owner of The Open Jar restaurants in Norton and Hartlepool, said it was ""another negative result"" for the hospitality industry.
While he praised support during the first lockdown, such as the furlough scheme which has been extended until March 2021, he felt the industry was being ""hung out to dry"".
""We class ourselves as one of the cleanest places to go,"" he said.
""Tables get wiped down - that's not because of Covid, that's just what restaurants have done, since restaurants have been restaurants.

"The Covid-19 epidemic is ravaging our tattered healthcare system and shredding our economy. In the past month, over 22 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits, compounding the fear that unemployment could breach 32% absent massive public action. This is an unmitigated human disaster, recalling the horrors of the Great Depression. And it gets worse. We’re also facing the climate emergency. Immediate relief is necessary – but not sufficient. To tackle all these crises at once, we need a Green Stimulus that creates jobs and lifts up communities in ways that also slash carbon pollution, increase resiliency, and develop a just, modern economy. No one can predict when Speaker Nancy Pelosi and President Donald Trump will turn their full attention to economic recovery. But behind the scenes, the planning has already begun. It’s not a question of whether we spend big on stimulus, but what kind of stimulus. And while Republicans will decry anything “green”, we can win the argument. But much of what we propose already has bipartisan support, from polling to pending legislation. Climate change is about to supercharge the coronavirus emergency. In April, California’s wildfire season will start. Restrictions on work caused by the pandemic will make it harder for firefighters to conduct controlled burns that steer fires – and smoke – from homes. Californians’ lungs could face Covid-19 and unusually intense smoke at the same time. A third of the country also faces serious flood risk through the spring. And in summer and fall, forecasters predict “above average probability for major hurricanes making landfall along the continental United States”. We’re already seeing this catastrophic convergence elsewhere: In Ecuador, a muted government response to flooding in indigenous communities, for fear of spreading the virus; in Fiji, devastated by Cyclone Harold this week, 19 confirmed coronavirus cases are casting doubt on how to rebuild. Here too, we will need to find ways to do the needed relief work without deepening the pandemic. Amid all this suffering, the case for bold moves to tackle the miseries of inequality, Covid, and climate at once will get clearer. Moreover, green stimulus is the only option for a smooth transition to the 21st century green economy. The era of dirty energy is ending. Even the conservative CBNC analyst Jim Cramer has warned investors that oil stocks are no longer safe investments, as society is increasingly repudiating fossil fuels. Giant investors like Blackrock are gradually winding down their investments in carbon. And at the European level, and in countries like Germany and South Korea, a green stimulus-based recovery is becoming the consensus choice, with investments in efficiency and clean energy seen as obvious drivers of economic reconstruction. Here in the US, green stimulus is easily the best way to create good jobs through public investment. According to a 2011 World Bank study, $1m invested in the oil and gas in the United States creates just five jobs, compared to 17 jobs per million dollars invested in energy-saving building retrofits, 22 jobs for mass transit, 13 for wind, and 14 for solar. Kammen’s research and that of other institutes all concur that investment in a modern green economy is a more efficient job creator than the fossil sector. The longer-term vision of the green stimulus is a more rewarding, lifelong career of dignified green work. We should also invest in Stem education for all children and create apprenticeship programs in vulnerable communities, matched with new careers for workers to enter. And by directly investing in frontline communities, following best practices in California, we can bring technologies like solar and battery storage to neighborhoods that have been scandalously left out of the clean energy boom so far. Plus, these same nimble, local solutions make neighborhoods more resilient to extreme weather. Local storage and nested microgrids make the power system, including healthcare facilities, more reliable during disasters. We’d be making environmental, economic, and social improvements in the same places, at the same time. And we should speak of green investments in concrete terms. Polling conducted by Data for Progress in March finds majority support for massive green spending overall. More interesting is the finding of even greater support – including majority Republican approval – for specific public green investments, like electric buses, retrofits to low-income housing, and renewable energy. Strip away abstract rhetoric, and the substance that we’re advocating is incredibly popular. For these reasons, we recently joined nine other experts in social and climate policy to write a letter to Congress outlining a menu of policy options for a Green Stimulus. Our proposals span eight sectors of the economy. But fundamentally, a Green Stimulus is about mobilizing massive public funds – say, $2tn to start – in specific green investments to create high-quality jobs and improve the quality of life, especially in low-income communities, communities of color, and indigenous communities, which have suffered the most disinvestment and pollution in recent decades. It seems counterintuitive, but the timing for such a Green Stimulus is perfect. Bridge-loans and advance payments on public green purchases of goods like solar panels and electric vehicles for public use would stabilize firms’ and workers’ finances. Announcing initiatives like a Climate Conservation Corps would give young people eager to work jobs to apply for, and plan to start. And desk workers across the economy could get on Zoom and do paperwork to make green projects shovel-ready the minute it’s safe to break ground. (Indeed, a major reason the 2009 Obama stimulus faltered was months wasted on paperwork.) Each of us has lived through climate-fueled disasters – in Cohen’s case, Hurricane Sandy, and in Kammen’s, last year’s devastating wildfires. We agree with the environmental justice advocates who argued then that disaster recovery shouldn’t be about trying to bounce back to how things were before the disaster. We don’t want to bounce back to a January 2020 economy when half the country lived paycheck to paycheck; unchecked carbon pollution endangered our future; and racial inequalities made people of color so vulnerable to disease. Rather, by deploying a Green Stimulus that centers workers and communities, we can bounce forward together.

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern says the Government is keen to declare a **climate-change emergency** but work needs to be done to get more MPs onboard.  
“I don’t see why there should be any reasons why members of Parliament wouldn’t want to demonstrate that this is a matter of urgency,” she told media today when talking about climate change.

"**Quizzes rather than board games are one of the recommendations from scientists for a Covid-safe Christmas.**
Earlier this week, the government announced up to three households will be allowed to form a ""Christmas bubble"" from 23 to 27 December.
But the government's scientific advisory committee, Sage, warns coronavirus could easily spread during the festive relaxation of the rules.
They say people should still weigh up if an event could be postponed.
If not, meeting online or outdoors where the risks of transmission are lower, could be a better option.
But if you do go ahead, they say, it's important to include everyone taking part in drawing up a plan for how to manage the event.
They highlight the particular importance of involving women in the decision-making.
The document says: ""Women carry the burden of creating and maintaining family traditions and activities at Christmas.
""Messaging should be supportive of women adapting traditions and encouraging those around them to share the burden and to be supportive of any alterations to adapt for Covid-19 restrictions.""
The advisers recognise that negotiating these arrangements may ""create tensions"".
But they suggest a series of measures, ranging from minimising the numbers getting together to keeping events brief to avoiding physical contact.
Maintaining social distancing, keeping surfaces clean and opening windows to allow in fresh air are all highlighted.
There are also practical suggestions:
But there's a warning that no single measure will guarantee that Christmas is risk-free.
Scientists warn that, within households, one infected person can pass the virus to as many as 50% of the rest.
And they say that the spread of the disease could multiply as the newly-infected people return to their usual lives after the break.
In one paper, the advisers spell out that ""this is not a theoretical risk"".
They point to earlier research into how other respiratory diseases such as pneumonia increase as older family members are exposed during the school holidays.
That's why they conclude that cases are set to rise.
""The prevalence could easily double during a few days of the festive season, with further multiplicative increases as new infections go back to their ""routine"" networks.""
Another document published by Sage makes clear that most coronavirus infections happen during prolonged indoor gatherings of people who are familiar with each other.
That creates what's called an ""intimacy paradox"" in which we let our guard down because we don't see our loved ones as a potential dangers."
"When coral scientist Dr Zoe Richards left the Great Barrier Reef’s Lizard Island in late January, she was feeling optimistic. Richards is a taxonomist. Since 2011 she has recorded and monitored 245 coral species at 14 locations around the island’s research station, about 270km north of Cairns.  In 2017 she saw “mass destruction of the reef”. Back-to-back mass bleaching in 2016 and 2017, and cyclones in 2014 and 2015, had wreaked havoc. But in January, she saw thousands of new colonies of fast-growing Acropora corals that had “claimed the space” left by dead and degraded corals. In a three-year window without spiralling heat or churning cyclones, some corals were in an adolescent bloom – not mature enough to spawn, but getting close. “It was an incredible recovery,” says Richards, of Curtin University. “But I knew if it was hit again, it would be trouble – and that’s exactly what happened.” In 2020, mass bleaching returned to Lizard Island – perhaps not as badly as in previous years – but enough, says Richards, to turn the clock back on the recovery she had seen. Day 1 of coral biodiversity re-surveys @ Lizard I, GBR. After 2 cyclones & 2 bleaching events in a decade, it's great to see a range of healthy young Acropora colonies fighting back! #coralnotcoal#recoveryispossibleA. echinata (blue), A. speciosa (pink) & A. spathulata (orange) pic.twitter.com/CO7BhJdu72 This summer has delivered a third mass bleaching for the reef in just five years. The back-to-back bleaching of 2016 and 2017 was mostly confined to the northern and central sections. Data from aerial surveys is still being analysed, but the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has said preliminary results suggest the 2020 bleaching had a much broader footprint. When bleaching is mild, corals can and do recover, although it can make them more susceptible to disease. But severe bleaching can kill corals. Estimates are that the 2016 bleaching killed about 29% of the reef’s shallow water corals and the 2017 event took another 19%. Some scientists are now concerned global heating may have reached a point where tropical reefs bleach almost every year. What this means for the reef in the coming decades is an area of live research and debate among scientists. Scientists Guardian Australia spoke to say the reef’s fortunes hang on the answers to two questions. The first is whether governments around the world will make deeper cuts to greenhouse gas emissions than they have already agreed and, if so, how close they will get to keeping global heating to 1.5C. A second is whether efforts to first identify and then deploy a swathe of potential measures that could reduce the impact of rising temperatures will be successful. What seems clear is that without some human intervention, the magic of the world’s greatest coral reef system will be lost. Prof Peter Mumby, professor of coral reef ecology at the University of Queensland, is the chief scientist at the Great Barrier Reef Foundation – the once-small not-for-profit that was awarded a controversial $443m government grant in 2018. He said the 2020 bleaching “is giving us greater pause, given it seems we can see quite frequent coral bleaching events earlier than people had previously expected”. Mumby says bleaching events have been “patchy”, and the fact that some areas have escaped “means there’s an opportunity for management”. What keeps the reef functioning as a single ecosystem is the way each reef connects to another through the way corals reproduce. They all either spawn, or produce larvae, that can float in the water column and settle on nearby reefs. Mumby and colleagues have identified about 100 reefs along the GBR that are well spread, well connected to other reefs by ocean currents, and tend to experience cooler temperatures. He says making sure those reefs stay as healthy as possible – in particular by managing outbreaks of the coral-eating crown of thorns starfish – could be crucial in keeping the wider reef viable. The reef’s unrivalled size and diversity – almost 4,000 reefs, cays and islands stretching for more than 2,000 kilometres – gives it extra resilience, he says. Climate change is still the reef’s biggest threat and society will need to focus on tackling it, “but there needs to be a way to adapt to how we manage reefs so that they can roll with the punches – we have to do both those things”. The Australian Institute of Marine Sciences (AIMS) has produced an as-yet unpublished study, sent to the federal government, that reviews more than 160 different interventions that have been suggested for the reef, identifying about 40 that could be worth further study. Dr Lina Bay, a principal research scientists at AIMS, says one promising area of study is what’s known as “assisted gene flow”, where the spawn of corals with better tolerance for heat could be captured and then dispersed. “Not all corals are created equal,” she says. “Some have a higher stress tolerance than others. Over many years we’ve shown that the variation in bleaching tolerance is hereditable – it gets passed from parents to offspring.” She says these differences can exist even among the same species, meaning those corals can be selectively grown in a lab setting to promote more heat tolerance. AIMS scientist Dr Neal Cantin has just finished a three-year experiment with one fast-growing coral species called Pocillopora acuta, which behaves like a weed by filling in the gaps when less hardy corals die off. Starting with 90 parent specimens taken from three different parts of the Great Barrier Reef, Cantin and colleagues grew 7,500 offspring and then subjected them to rising levels of CO2 and temperatures of up to 2C warming. Even at high temperatures, some of these corals survived, and they were able to tolerate higher levels of heat as the experiment went on. Having a street-fighting weedy coral like this is important, says Cantin. Dead areas of coral reefs tend to get covered in algae, but Cantin says a weedy coral that can compete with the algae can then make room for slower-growing corals to also grow. “The whole goal of a lot of these interventions is to work with species that can be successful on their own. We won’t be able to work with 600 species of corals, but we could probably work with 20 that fill the functional roles of a healthy reef community. “You can’t deny bleaching events are becoming more frequent and more severe and they’re impacting across a bigger area than before. We can just document that demise, or we can learn from it and have some corals for future generations.” That demise is clear and it happens at scale, and also in detail. Zoe Richards has already seen evidence of likely local extinctions of some corals at Lizard Island. One is a spiralised plate coral – Acropora clathrata – that she hasn’t been able to find for years. “It’s these silent extinctions that go on,” she says. “The entire reef is operating like one big meta population with sub-populations that are connected to each other. If you successively take out nodes in that population, sooner or later you will end up with parts that don’t connect. It will be fragmented into subsets that will continue to erode in terms of diversity. It’s degradation of the [coral] community at a very large scale.” Prof Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, of the University of Queensland, has done pioneering work on the study of coral bleaching going back to the mid-1980s. He remembers Lizard Island as a “picture perfect” place to do research on corals in the late 80s, when his research there found rising temperatures caused corals to lose their “symbionts” – the algae that lives in the coral and gives them much of their nutrients and colour. The Great Barrier Reef’s first major mass bleaching event happened in 1998. There was another in 2002, and again in 2016, 2017 and 2020. Hoegh-Guldberg says: “We knew there was a temperature effect, and we knew that temperatures were going up. At the end of the 90s, I could put those two things together.” The year after the reef’s first mass bleaching, Hoegh-Guldberg took climate models to forecast that if greenhouse gas emissions kept growing then, by 2020, “the average bleaching event is likely to be similar or greater than the 1998 event”. As 2020 approached, the models showed reefs across the northern, central and southern regions would see between eight and 10 bleaching events per decade. “I wished I’d been wrong” he says. “I think I said at the time that I’d have egg on my face if I was wrong. But there’s no egg on my face.” Hoegh-Guldberg says manually replanting corals is uneconomic at scale but there’s merit in helping the dispersal of coral larvae, pointing to a technique being developed by a scientist at Southern Cross University that captures millions of larvae in floating pools. But he says the main game is keeping global heating down. “Let’s say we get to 1.5C and then we can stabilise – that’s really the last call for reefs. Corals will come back and there will be winners and losers, but you’ll have a functional reef that supports fisheries and tourism.” The problem is that right now, government pledges under the Paris agreement are enough to raise temperatures by 3C – not 1.5C. “At 2C all the reef-building corals have plummeted and instead you are looking at the dominance of other organisms like algae. At 3C you basically have nothing. “I’m fearful that in the next 10 years we will see the loss of coral across the planet at phenomenal rates,” he says. “That’s what keeps me up at night.”"

INTRODUCTION
I’ve written numerous posts that describe the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), what the PDO represents, and, just as important, what it does not represent. For those new to the PDO and for those needing a refresher, refer to An Introduction To ENSO, AMO, and PDO — Part 3An Introduction To ENSO, AMO, and PDO — Part 3.
IceCap recently published a post about the PDO. One of the illustrations in that post confirms a point I have been making: that the PDO does not represent the Sea Surface Temperatures of the North Pacific. And I’ve added a few additional comments and clarifications about the IceCap post.
In my post An Introduction To ENSO, AMO, and PDO — Part 3, the discussions of the PDO patternwere about the spatial pattern. But the word pattern can also be time-related and, therefore, it could pertain to the PDO’s “behavior in time”. A recent discussion on a blog thread gave me the impression that the multiple meanings of the word pattern could be the cause of some of the confusion about the PDO.
Also, much of the post An Introduction To ENSO, AMO, and PDO — Part 3discussed and illustrated the fact that the PDO does not represent the Sea Surface Temperature Anomalies of the North Pacific. There is another factor that may lead to some of the continued misunderstandings about the PDO. The PDO data is standardized. This could greatly exaggerate the magnitude of its variations. Could the standardization also inflate its perceived importance?
I had also wanted to include the errors in the SkepticalScience post It’s Pacific Decadal Oscillation . The SkepticalScience post was obviously written by someone who never plotted the Sea Surface Temperature anomalies of the North Pacific, who misunderstands how the PDO is calculated and what it represents, and who misunderstands or elects to misrepresent climate oscillations. But this post is long, so I’ll present the Skeptical Science errors in a separate post.
THE ICECAP PDO POST
Figure 1 is a screen cap of the opening of Joe D’Aleo’s post about the PDO at IceCap. I’ve included the screen cap because if you were to click on the post title Is the PDO real or a skeptic inventionat IceCap the link does not bring you to the post; it links to a .pdf document titled “THE PDO.” Most of the IceCap post and the linked .pdf document appear to be the same, but their opening paragraphs and the titles are different.

Figure 1

That aside, most of the IceCap post is intended to confirm the existence of the PDO, which is something I don’t dispute. If you’ve watched any of the SST .gif animations or videos I’ve prepared, the positive and negative PDO spatial patterns are very visible. And they should be; the PDO spatial pattern is the most prevalent of the many that form in the North Pacific SST anomalies. The IceCap post also mentions using the Pacific Decadal Oscillation in weather forecasts. Since there are a number of papers that describe weather patterns associated with the PDO, I imagine the PDO data is a useful index for meteorologists.
But one of the points that I have illustrated and discussed a number of times is that the PDO does not represent the Sea Surface Temperature anomalies of the North Pacific, north of 20N. The IceCap post includes a group of PDO- and ENSO-related maps, Figure 2. And those maps actually illustrate that the PDO does not represent the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) anomalies of the North Pacific.

Figure 2
I’ve modified the illustration, Figure 3, by highlighting the area used to calculate the PDO data and by covering the rest of the maps with text. The PDO is not calculated from the SST data south of 20N, so all of that additional visual information exaggerates the surface area represented by the PDO.

Figure 3
My text in Figure 3 reads: In The Positive (Warm) Phase Map Of The PDO Shown Above Left, The Sea Surface Temperature Anomaly For The North Pacific North Of 20N Appears To Be Negative. That Is, The Negative SST Anomalies Cover A Greater Surface Area And They Are More Intense Than The Positive Anomalies. The Opposite Holds True For The Map On The Right-Hand Side. How Then Could A Positive (Warm) Phase Of The PDO Raise Global Surface Temperatures, And Vice Versa?
Someone is bound to note that the IceCap post does not mention that the PDO has an impact on Global surface temperatures. Agreed. Their post doesn’t. This part of my discussion is about the common belief that the sign of the PDO dictates whether global temperatures rise or fall. Since the sign of the PDO does not represent the Sea Surface Temperature of the North Pacific the belief is unfounded.
In past posts, I’ve presented that there is an inverse relationship between the PDO and the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) Anomalies of the North Pacific. This can be shown with a graph that compares the PDO data and the difference between the SST anomalies of the North Pacific north of 20N and global SST anomalies. For simplicity sake, we’ll use the term “North Pacific Residual” for the data that’s calculated as the North Pacific SST anomalies minus the Global SST anomalies. Refer to Figure 4. We’ll use the North Pacific Residual in the comparison graph because one of the steps taken to calculate the PDO is to subtract Global SST anomalies from the SST anomalies of each 5 degree by 5 degree grid of the North Pacific north of 20N. Both datasets in Figure 4 have been smoothed with 121-month running average filters. Other than the agreement between the multidecadal variations in the two curves, there are a couple of things to note about the graph. First, the PDO data has been inverted; that is, it’s been multiplied by a negative number. Second, the PDO data has also been scaled by a factor of 0.2. That was an arbitrarily chosen round number I used to bring the variations of the PDO down into line with the North Pacific Residual data. But let’s look at the scaling in another way: the multidecadal variations in the PDO data are five times higher than the actual variations in the North Pacific Residual data in that graph. One might conclude the PDO data exaggerates the actual multidecadal variations in North Pacific SST anomalies. More on that later.

Figure 4
Figure 4 is taken from the post An Inverse Relationship Between The PDO And North Pacific SST Anomaly Residuals.
The SST anomaly data for the North Pacific is part of the Global Surface Temperature data, but the PDO data is not. This inverse relationship between the PDO and the SST anomaly data of the North Pacific directly contradicts the assumption that a positive (warm) PDO is responsible a rise in global temperatures or that a negative (cold) PDO is somehow responsible for a drop in global temperatures.
The IceCap post attempts to resurrect the argument that there is no clear evidence that ENSO drives the PDO. IceCap bases their brief discussion on a quote from the 14-year old Mantua et al (1997) paper “A Pacific interdecadal climate oscillation with impacts on salmon production.” The IceCap post reads, “The authors made no claim as to which (PDO or ENSO) was the chicken and which the egg.” And IceCap includes a quote from Mantua et al (1997):
“The ENSO and PDO climate patterns are clearly related, both spatially and temporally, to the extent that the PDO may be viewed as ENSO-like interdecadal climate variability (Tanimoto et al. 1993; ZWB). While it may be tempting to interpret interdecadal climatic shifts as responses to individual (tropical) ENSO events, it seems equally conceivable that the state of the interdecadal PDO constrains the envelope of interannual ENSO variability.”
That paragraph from Mantua et al (1997) appears to contradict a paper they reference. Mantua et al (1997) calculate the PDO using a method that was presented in Zhang et al (1997) ENSO-like Interdecadal Variability: 1900–93. In Zhang et al (1997), the PDO was identified as “NP”, and they use Cold Tongue Index SST anomalies (CT) as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) proxy. Zhang et al (1997) note:
“Figure 7 shows the cross-correlation function between CT and each of the other time series in Fig. 5. The lag is barely perceptible for TP and G and it increases to about a season for G – TP and NP, confirming that on the interannual timescale the remote features in the patterns shown in Fig. 6 are occurring in response to the ENSO cycle rather than as an integral part of it…”
It would be difficult for the PDO to drive ENSO if ENSO leads the PDO by a season and if the PDO spatial pattern is a “response to the ENSO cycle rather than…an integral part of it.”
In the 14 years since Mantua et al (1997) was published, there have been a number of papers that confirm that ENSO drives the PDO. In ENSO-Forced Variability of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, Newman et al (2004) also found that the PDO lags ENSO. They describe cell d of their Figure 1 as:
“ENSO also leads the PDO index by a few months throughout the year (Fig. 1d), most notably in winter and summer. Simultaneous correlation is lowest in November– March, consistent with Mantua et al. (1997). The lag of maximum correlation ranges from two months in summer (r ~ 0.7) to as much as five months by late winter (r ~ 0.6). During winter and spring, ENSO leads the PDO for well over a year, consistent with reemergence of prior ENSO-forced PDO anomalies. Summer PDO appears to lead ENSO the following winter, but this could be an artifact of the strong persistence of ENSO from summer to winter (r = 0.8), combined with ENSO forcing of the PDO in both summer and winter. Note also that for intervals less than 1yr the lag autocorrelation of the PDO is low when the lag autocorrelation of ENSO (not shown) is also low, through the so-called spring persistence barrier (Torrence and Webster 1998).”
And the first sentence of the Conclusions of Newman et al (2004) reads (their italics):
“The PDO is dependent upon ENSO on all timescales.”
My post An Introduction To ENSO, AMO, and PDO — Part 3 included the same discussions of those two papers under the heading of DOES THE PDO DRIVE ENSO? 
A more recent paper, Shakun and Shaman (2009) “Tropical origins of North and South Pacific decadal variability” also confirms that the PDO is an aftereffect of ENSO. In addition to the PDO, they use the acronym PDV for Pacific Decadal Variability.
The Shakun and Shaman (2009) Conclusions read:
“Deriving a Southern Hemisphere equivalent of the PDO index shows that the spatial signature of the PDO can be well explained by the leading mode of SST variability for the South Pacific. Thus, PDV appears to be a basin-wide phenomenon most likely driven from the tropics. Moreover, while it was already known PDV north of the equator could be adequately modeled as a reddened response to ENSO, our results indicate this is true to an even greater extent in the South Pacific.”
These papers confirm my statements from past posts that the PDO is an aftereffect of ENSO. And that brings us to the two tables from the IceCap post, which I have merged into one graphic, Figure 5. IceCap introduces the tables by stating:
“During the positive phase see the dominance of more frequent, stronger, longer La Ninas and the positive PDO mode, more frequent, stronger and longer El Ninos.”
There is an obvious error in that sentence. It should begin with “During the negativephase…”

Figure 5
Now I do realize that IceCap has not stated that the positive PDO is responsible for the more frequent, stronger and longer El Niño events and vice versa, but they implied it. And that contradicts the papers above. Since the PDO is an aftereffect of ENSO, a period when El Niño events dominated would cause the PDO to be positive, and vice versa for epochs when La Niña events dominate.
A SIMPLE DESCRIPTION OF HOW THE PDO SPATIAL PATTERN IS FORMED
To reinforce the discussion above, the following is a simple explanation of the processes that cause the PDO spatial pattern during ENSO events.
A positive PDO spatial pattern is characterized by SST anomalies in the eastern North Pacific that are higher than the SST anomalies in the central and western North Pacific. That positive PDO pattern is created by the response of the North Pacific SST anomalies to an El Niño event. Changes in coupled ocean-atmosphere processes, resulting from the El Niño, can cause an increase in the SST anomalies in the eastern North Pacific. Since the El Niño causes a reversal of trade winds in the western tropical Pacific, less warm water than normal is spun up into the western and central North Pacific (an area called the Kuroshio-Oyashio Extension or KOE), and SST anomalies of the western and central North Pacific drop. The initial drop in the western and central North Pacific is also driven by the changes in coupled ocean-atmosphere processes that are caused by the El Niño. The reverse holds true during a La Niña in the eastern North Pacific. For the western and central North Pacific during a La Niña, the leftover warm water from the El Niño also gets spun up into the KOE, adding to the warm waters being brought there by the increased strength of the trade winds, both of which raise SST anomalies there.
There are differences between the PDO and an ENSO proxy such as NINO3.4 SST anomalies from time to time. (NINO3.4 SST anomalies are a commonly used proxy for the frequency and magnitude of El Niño and La Niña events.) The reason for this is that other factors can impact how the North Pacific SST anomalies respond to ENSO events. These other factors include shifts in sea level pressure in the North Pacific and a phenomenon called The Reemergence Mechanismalong the Kuroshio-Oyashio extension (KOE). Aerosols from explosive volcanic eruptions should also account for some of the differences between the PDO and an ENSO proxy, though I have never seen this discussed in any papers.
CAN THE MULTIPLE MEANINGS OF THE WORD PATTERN ADD TO THE CONFUSION ABOUT THE PDO?
The Joint Institute for the Study of the Atmosphere and Ocean Joint Institute for the Study of the Atmosphere and OceanJoint Institute for the Study of the Atmosphere and Ocean (JISAO) Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) webpage is a primary source for PDO information and data. Two maps are used by JISAO to illustrate the spatial patterns that can exist during the warm and cool phases of the PDO, Figure 6. I’ve highlighted the area of the North Pacific represented by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. It is the area north of 20N, and only that area. The word “pattern” in the opening paragraph on that webpage refers to the “spatial climate fingerprint” of the North Pacific north of 20N, not the multidecadal variability of its data. As discussed previously in this post, when the PDO data is positive (warm phase), the SST anomalies in the eastern North Pacific are warmer than those in the western and central North Pacific, and when the PDO is negative (cool phase), the SST anomalies in the eastern North Pacific are cooler than the SST anomalies in the western and central north Pacific.

Figure 6
Farther down on the JISAO PDO webpage, the PDO is described as:
The “Pacific Decadal Oscillation” (PDO) is a long-lived El Niño-like pattern of Pacific climate variability. While the two climate oscillations have similar spatial climate fingerprints, they have very different behavior in time.
Again, the word pattern is being used to describe spatial characteristics of the SST anomalies.
As discussed in An Introduction To ENSO, AMO, and PDO — Part 3An Introduction To ENSO, AMO, and PDO — Part 3, the phrase “El Niño-like pattern” does NOT mean that the North Pacific (north of 20N) has a separate El Niño-like event.It refers to the fact that a typical El Niño event creates a spatial pattern in the North Pacific where it is warmer in the east than it is in the central and western portions, and a typical La Niña event will create the opposite pattern, cooler in the east than it is toward the center and west of the North Pacific.
Figure 7 is a time-series graph that compares the PDO and NINO3.4 SST anomalies (a commonly used proxy for the frequency and magnitude of El Niño and La Niña events). Both datasets have been smoothed with a 121-month filter. Keep in mind that the NINO3.4 SST anomalies represent exactly that, the SST anomalies of an area of the tropical Pacific called the NINO3.4 region, which is bordered by the coordinates of 5S-5N, 170W-120W, while the PDO does not represent the SST anomalies of the North Pacific. The PDO is a statistically manufactured dataset. As illustrated, the multidecadal variations in the PDO and the NINO3.4 SST anomalies are different. Both vary from positive to negative in the mid-1940s and rise from negative to positive in the late 1970s, but the NINO3.4 SST anomalies have an extra period of positive values in the 1960s. As discussed earlier in this post, the reason the PDO has a different “behavior in time” is because the PDO is also strongly impacted by other factors, including sea level pressure and volcanic eruptions.

Figure 7
In summary, on the main JISAO Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) webpage, the word pattern always refers to the “spatial” characteristics of the North Pacific SST anomalies, not its behavior in time.
THE WORD PATTERN CAN ALSO BE TIME RELATED
The second illustration on the main JISAO Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) webpage is a time-series graph of the PDO data. It was missing from the website as I prepared this post. But there are copies posted at other websites. Refer to Figure 8.

Figure 8
On their PDO Index Monthly Values webpage, JISAO uses the phrase “the pattern of variability” to describe the PDO’s “behavior in time” or the periodicity of the PDO data. Refer to the description of the dataset at the top of the page. It reads (my boldface):
Updated standardized values for the PDO index, derived as the leading PC of monthly SST anomalies in the North Pacific Ocean, poleward of 20N. The monthly mean global average SST anomalies are removed to separate this pattern of variability from any “global warming” signal that may be present in the data. 
The uses of the word pattern are different, and their intents are different. Does the use of the word pattern in both instances add to the confusion about the PDO? I don’t have the answer. I’m asking the question. Clearly, the use of pattern in the JISAO description of “The ‘Pacific Decadal Oscillation’ (PDO) is a long-lived El Niño-like pattern” relates to its spatial characteristics. Likewise, the word pattern in the JISAO description of their maps, “Typical wintertime Sea Surface Temperature (colors), Sea Level Pressure (contours) and surface windstress (arrows) anomaly patternsduring warm and cool phases of PDO,” refers to the same thing, the spatial pattern.
Note: I mentioned above that there are no El Niño or La Niña events in the North Pacific north of 20N. I have shown, however, that there are secondary releases of heat in the North Pacific from the warm waters left over from an El Niño. These secondary releases of heat from the North Pacific occur along the Kuroshio-Oyashio Extension (KOE) and they occur during La Niña events that follow major El Niño events. Refer to The ENSO-Related Variations In Kuroshio-Oyashio Extension (KOE) SST Anomalies And Their Impact On Northern Hemisphere Temperatures.
DOES THE PDO DATA EXAGGERATE ITS RELATIVE SIGNIFICANCE?
Figure 9 compares the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) data and NINO3.4 SST anomalies. The scales are similar and that might lead one who is unaware of the differences between the two datasets to believe the two “signals” are similar in magnitude. That’s wrong for a number of reasons. First, the NINO3.4 SST anomalies represent the SST anomalies of an area in the equatorial Pacific, but the PDO data does not represent the SST anomalies of the North Pacific. The PDO data is a statistically manufactured dataset that represents an abstract form of the SST data there. Second, the NINO3.4 SST anomalies are presented in Deg C. The PDO data is not. The PDO data has been standardized.

Figure 9
Unfortunately, as far as I know, there is no PDO data available online that has not been standardized. So to illustrate the PDO data before standardization, one would have to duplicate the process JISAO uses to create it. Two of the three SST datasets JISAO uses are obsolete and the differences between those older datasets and the current spatially complete datasets are significant, so the results could be very different. And we really do not need to go through all of that trouble to show that the PDO exaggerates the variability of the North Pacific SST anomalies. We can show that other ways.
The inverse relationship between the PDO and the North Pacific Residual was illustrated in Figure 4. And as you’ll recall, the North Pacific Residual was calculated by subtracting Global SST anomalies from North Pacific SST anomalies, north of 20N. Both datasets in Figure 4 were smoothed with a 121-month running-average filter and the PDO data was scaled and inverted (multiplied by -0.2) to bring its variations into line with the North Pacific Residual data. For the next illustration, Figure 10, let’s leave the PDO data in its raw monthly form, and only invert (multiply by -1) the North Pacific Residual data. That is, we won’t scale either dataset. As shown in Figure 10, the actual variations in the North Pacific Residual are miniscule compared to those of the standardized PDO data.

Figure 10
The standard deviation of the North Pacific Residual data is 0.177, so to standardize that dataset we divide it by that value, or multiply it by its reciprocal of 5.65. Refer to Figure 11. Note how well the inverted and standardized North Pacific Residual data (using a different SST dataset, HADISST) captures the underlying multidecadal variations of the PDO data.

Figure 11
And we can detrend the North Pacific SST anomaly data to also show how the PDO exaggerates actual North Pacific Sea Surface Temperature variability. Again in this example, both datasets are in their “raw” form, and the detrended North Pacific SST anomalies are inverted (multiplied by -1.0). The PDO data as shown in Figure 12 greatly exaggerates the actual variations in the detrended North Pacific SST anomalies.

Figure 12
To standardize the detrended North Pacific SST anomalies, we’ll divide the data by its standard deviation (0.182), or multiply it by its reciprocal of 5.5. Once again, as shown in Figure 13, much of the multidecadal variability of the PDO can be captured by inverting and scaling the adjusted North Pacific SST anomalies.

Figure 13
Whether we present the North Pacific SST anomalies detrended or as a residual, the PDO data exaggerates the actual variations in North Pacific SST anomalies by a factor of at least 5.5. This may also lead to some the misunderstandings of the effects of the PDO on global temperatures.
CLOSING
The PDO is a useful index. Based on the IceCap post, it is used by meteorologists for weather predictions. The early papers about the PDO discussed its impact on salmon production, so it is also useful in those endeavors. But the PDO cannot be used to explain epochs of global warming or cooling because the PDO does not represent a process through which the North Pacific could raise or lower global temperatures.
This post also illustrated how the PDO data is inversely related to North Pacific SST anomalies and how the PDO data greatly exaggerates the actual variations in the Sea Surface Temperatures of the North Pacific.
In a follow-up post, we’ll discuss the error-filled SkepticalScience post It’s Pacific Decadal Oscillation.

This week, the Senate voted on and debated a proposed constitutional amendment that would give Congress and the states nearly unlimited power to regulate election spending. The 79–18 vote was only a cloture vote to advance the resolution to the floor, and the proposed amendment stands almost no chance of passing the high hurdle needed to become part of our Constitution–that is, a two‐​thirds vote from both houses of Congress and ratification by three‐​fourths (38) of the state legislatures.



Yet, even despite the resolution’s poor political prospects, there is one word to best describe it: Terrifying. Even though this resolution can be properly classified as a political stunt, and even though some Senators (including some Republicans) only voted for it just to score political points, it is terrifying that this proposed amendment can even score political points.



If passed, the amendment would repeal the most important parts of the First Amendment, those that protect our right to advocate for political change. If passed, the amendment would create a world where pornography, videos depicting small animals being crushed, profanity‐​laden jackets, and Phelps family funeral protests all receive more protection from government interference than even the smallest amount of political speech.





In the world championed by the terrifying Senate Democrats, individuals will have to seek permission from the government to criticize it.



By giving Congress and state governments essentially unlimited power to prohibit or regulate anyone who is spending money trying to “influence elections,” the Senate stooped to a level of governmental malfeasance previously reserved for the former Soviet Union, North Korea, Cuba, and Venezuela. In fact, if Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro passed this same law, Americans would properly see it as a thinly veiled attempt to squelch the political rights of Venezuelans and to entrench himself in power.



In an America, though, where the words “spend money to influence elections” are increasingly spoken in same the ominous tones used to describe the actions of thieves and murderers, those who want to genuinely protect political speech are becoming distressingly rare. Many Democrats have fully jettisoned their historic support for free speech in the name of “equality of voice”–with numerous exceptions to that supposed equality principle, of course, for Oprah, the _New York Times_ , actors, established political parties, and incumbent politicians.



Or perhaps not. Under this amendment, Congress could feasibly ban an hour‐​long Oprah special that featured current candidates, or even ban an all‐​star concert to raise awareness for some issue. The language of the resolution allows for “reasonable” regulations, up to and including prohibition, on spending money to influence elections. An Oprah special or an all‐​star concert certainly cost a lot of money, and they certainly influence elections.



Although the resolution claims to not impinge on freedom of the press, it is not clear who “the press” actually are. An Oprah special could easily be categorized as an “uncoordinated expenditure of a non‐​press media agency” and thus be prohibited. Oprah’s only recourse would be to plead that the categorization was “unreasonable,” an incredibly low standard of scrutiny that only requires that the regulation be “not crazy.”



Alternatively, Oprah could petition to government to be categorized as “press” and therefore be granted an exemption. Yet look carefully at what that means: In the world championed by the terrifying Senate Democrats, individuals will have to seek permission from the government to criticize it.



Look further into the crystal ball to imagine the world of the terrifying Senate Democrats: Hoping to continue to have their voice heard among the unequal voices of politicians, political parties, and the established press, the Koch brothers, Tom Steyer, and as‐​yet‐​unknown billionaires launch press organizations that have an ideological tilt, not unlike the _Washington Free Beacon_ and the _Huffington Post_. Agencies promulgate guidelines and the IRS creates a new tax status. Congressional hearings are held over whether they qualify as “press” or illegitimate “influencers” on elections, a situation that mirrors the current controversy over the IRS’s targeting of conservative 501(c)(4)s.



Eventually, governmentally determined “bona fide press organizations” will have to register with the government in order to criticize it, and our previous right to free political speech will become a government permit, given out by the very officials whose careers are contingent upon political speech.



Given the current political climate, where some Democrats have called for the FCC to rescind Fox News’s license and the IRS targets conservative organizations to determine if they are illegitimately “influencing elections,” does any of this sound far‐​fetched?



But wait, it gets worse: The amendment could also effectively outlaw organizations like the ACLU, the Sierra Club, Planned Parenthood, as well as my own organization, the Cato Institute as illegitimate influencers of elections. Current law allows those organizations to avoid “electioneering communications” by abstaining from endorsing or criticizing candidates. But that was the under the old, antiquated First Amendment, a relic of a bygone age in which people were properly skeptical about giving government the power “reasonable” censorship of those who “influence elections.”



Critics will respond that the resolution only regulates political spending, not political speech. This is one of the biggest pieces of piffle in modern political discourse. If regulating and drying up spending didn’t affect any political speech, then the reformers wouldn’t even want to do it. Rather than continuing to repeat that tired old line, Sen. Al Franken (D-MN) and other amendment supporters should come out and say precisely what they believe: that their view of “good government” requires giving them the broad power to censor political speech.



In short, the terrifying Senate Democrats should be called out for what they are: would be dictators with policy proposals that would make Pyongyang blush.

"On 15 April 2019, thousands of protestors took to the streets of London to call on the government to reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025. After hosting several protests in previous months, Extinction Rebellion embarked on a “climate rebellion” – its largest coordinated climate action to date. Demonstrators occupied five landmarks – Waterloo Bridge, Marble Arch, Parliament Square, Oxford Circus and Piccadilly Circus – while smaller protests took place in other cities around the world. Since then, the group has protested London Fashion Week, disrupted public transport, and blocked bridges around the country – often dividing public opinion. A year on from the group’s major protests, we’d like to hear from those involved in the movement about their experiences, and their hopes for the future.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA newly published paper by Nicola Scafetta of Duke University takes a look at sea level rise, particularly acceleration and deceleration in relation to ocean cycles: Multi-scale dynamical analysis (MSDA) of sea level records versus PDO, AMO, and NAO indexes. Climate Dynamics, in press.
Photo right: Prof. Nicola Scafetta
Professor Scafetta examined tide gauge records scattered over the globe that go back 300 years and compared the data to ocean cycles PDO, AMO and NAO indexes. He found some interesting results, to put it mildly.
According to the abstract of Scafetta’s paper:
Tide gauge accelerations oscillate significantly from positive to negative values mostly following the PDO, AMO and NAO oscillations. In particular, the influence of a large quasi 60–70 year natural oscillation is clearly demonstrated in these records.”
Moreover in the paper’s conclusion Scafetta writes that the tide gauge records were found…(my emphasis)
…to be characterized by significant oscillations at the decadal and multidcadal scales up to about 110-year intervals. Within these scales both positive and negative accelerations are found if a record is sufficiently long. This result suggests that acceleration patterns in tide gauge records are mostly driven by the natural oscillations of the climate system.”

No mention here of anything man-made. His conclusion also states (my emphasis):

In fact, although during the last 40–60 years positive accelerations are typically observed in tide gauge records, as found by Sallenger et al. (2012) and by Boon (2012), also during 40–60 year intervals since the beginning of the twentieth century equivalent or even higher positive accelerations are typically observed. On the contrary, at these same time scales, negative accelerations are observed during the middle of the twentieth century. This pattern demonstrates the influence of a large multidecadal 60-year natural cycle, which has been found in climate and solar/ astronomical records by numerous authors (e.g: Klyashtorin et al. 2009; Jevrejeva et al. 2008; Chambers et al. 2012; Scafetta 2010, 2012a; Scafetta and Willson 2013; Ogurtsov et al. 2002; Soon and Legates 2013).”

The argument that man’s fingerprint can be found in global sea level rise over the last century is looking weaker than ever (ignoring contribution by groundwater extraction on land). Sea level rise began its steady hike in 1850 when the world began to thaw naturally in the wake of the Little Ice Age. Periods of acceleration and deceleration coincide with oceanic cycles and have nothing to do with CO2 concentrations, let alone man.
The following chart is Figure 2 of the paper and is for illustrating the relation between the AMO and New York’s tide gauge record:

"**Pubs in England will still face restrictions when the national lockdown ends on 2 December and a new, tougher system of tiers is introduced to try to tackle the spread of coronavirus.**
The government has also said it will loosen its 10pm curfew for pubs.
So, why are pubs facing these controls and what is the evidence for them?
It depends which tier the local area is put in:
The restrictions in Tier 2 will affect so-called ""wet pubs"" which don't serve substantial meals.
The British Beer and Pub Association says they account for two thirds of pubs in England - that's about 25,000.
There are different rules in other nations in the UK.
In Scotland's tier system, pubs and restaurants are closed in level 4 and prevented from selling alcohol and required to close at 6pm, in level 3.
In Wales, pubs have to stop selling alcohol at 10pm but groups of four people from different households are allowed to meet indoors.
And in Northern Ireland, from 27 November, pubs (and bars and restaurants) can only offer takeaway, drive-through or delivery.
There is support available from the government. For example, businesses that are forced to close in England can receive up to Â£3,000 for each 28 day period. Those which have not been required to close but have been severely affected by restrictions may receive grants worth up to Â£2,100 for each 28 day period.
In Scotland it's between Â£2,000 or Â£3,000 for those forced to close and Â£1,400 or Â£2,100 for those affected by restrictions, depending on the rateable value of the property. That's also every four weeks.
Indoor venues, including pubs, bars and restaurants, have long been considered particularly vulnerable to the spreading of Covid-19.
""Wherever you get people crowded together, for example concert halls, cruise ships, house parties, bars and pubs, you risk spreading a virus,"" says Dr Julian Tang, a professor in respiratory sciences at the University of Leicester.
If people are sitting near each other talking without face masks or coverings, it can maximise the amount of spit droplets that are transferred between people, he says.
His research also highlights the potential risk if the virus is projected into the air whilst breathing and talking, where it stays suspended and may then be inhaled by others.
The World Health Organization has acknowledged that there is emerging evidence that coronavirus can be spread by tiny particles staying in the air and ""more studies are urgently needed.""
Evidence from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), which reports to the government, highlighted venues serving alcohol as a significant risk.
""Smaller gatherings such as bars and nightclubs are higher risk as you can be in closer contact with others,"" a report from the 11 February warned.
The new measures are aimed at further reducing the overall period of time that people spend in close contact with each other in pubs and restaurants.
We can't find a lot of specific scientific evidence supporting this rule but the logic seems to be based on the impact drinking can have on behaviour.
The Scottish government has published an impact assessment of it.
It says clinicians believe consuming alcohol limits people's ability to follow coronavirus rules.
It says combining drinking with a main meal cuts the effect of the alcohol as well as reducing the volume and speed of consumption.
A Sage report from September said ""Curfews [are] likely to have a marginal impact"", although it said it only had ""low confidence"" in that conclusion, suggesting there has been limited research into the question.
Previously, we asked the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) if there was any specific scientific advice about the cut-off time for pubs, bars and restaurants.
It did not provide it but said: ""The 10pm closure allows people to continue to socialise while reducing the risk of failing to socially distance.""
The government is now changing the curfew in England to allow for last orders at 10pm and closing at 11pm.
It says this will allow customers to ""depart gradually"" (when the original curfew was introduced there were scenes of pub-goers all leaving at once and crowding onto public transport).
We have some data but it does not tell the full story.
Public Health England (PHE) releases figures on outbreaks of coronavirus by the type of institution.
A total of 3,154 Covid-19 outbreaks were recorded between 3 August and 4 October (we're using this data because it corresponds with a period when pubs were open), including:
But this data requires two or more cases to be tracked down to the location via PHE's Health Protection Teams.
This means these people must get tested, report accurately where they had been to the government's Track and Trace programme, and for an investigation to conclude that these places had been the source of outbreaks.
This might be easier to do with closely monitored or prioritised places like schools, hospitals and care homes.
The Test and Trace system attempts to find out the places people visited in the week prior to showing coronavirus symptoms.
Of the 87,128 events people said they had attended in which there was some contact with others between 10 August and 24 September:
This data only highlights where people went prior to getting the virus but this may not be where they actually caught it.
Public Health England does say it is helpful in indicating ""possible places where transmission is happening"".

The federal government imposes a mandate to blend corn ethanol and other biofuels into the nation’s gasoline. This “renewable fuel standard” or RFS produces a range of negative effects, as discussed in this study at DownsizingGovernment.  




The “10% Ethanol” sticker you see at the gas station indicates that the government is subverting your free choice and raising your driving costs to benefit corn farmers. The government has decided that corn farmers are more important than you are.   
  
  
President Trump has supported the ethanol mandate, and he recently acted to increase the harm by allowing greater use of a 15 percent ethanol blend.   
  
  
A _Washington Post_ editorial today describes why that move is misguided:   




For more than a decade, the United States has pursued the foolhardy energy policy known as the Renewable Fuel Standard, or RFS. Thanks to legislation passed by a Democratic Congress and signed into law by a Republican president, George W. Bush, in 2007, the RFS illustrates the sad‐​but‐​true principle of Washington life that bipartisanship is no guarantee of wisdom. In a nutshell, the RFS required the nation’s petroleum refiners to blend ever‐​increasing quantities of biofuels, chiefly ethanol, into gasoline, purportedly to promote energy independence and fight climate change.   
  
  
Never mind that the United States has meanwhile become a major oil exporter, due to a production boom. Never mind that the environmental harms of ethanol arguably outweigh its benefits, because it takes massive amounts of energy to distill ethanol from corn — and massive amounts of fragile farmland to grow that crop. Never mind that diverting resources into corn production for ethanol raises the price of food. Never mind all that, because 39 percent of Iowa’s corn crop goes to create nearly 30 percent of all U.S. ethanol. And Iowa is a swing state with six crucial electoral votes and a first‐​in‐​the‐​nation presidential caucus; whatever Iowa wants, Iowa gets, from politicians of both parties.   
  
  
Hence President Trump’s announcement, on the midterm‐​election campaign trail in Iowa, that he would, in effect, double down on this decreasingly justifiable policy. Mr. Trump declared that the Environmental Protection Agency will draft regulations allowing the year‐​round sale of motor fuel containing 15 percent ethanol, as opposed to the 10 percent limitation in effect for several months a year because of air‐​pollution concerns related to summertime atmospheric conditions. This would incentivize gas station owners to install pumps capable of delivering the fuel, thus boosting ethanol sales.   
  
  
The point is to rescue Iowa corn farmers from adverse market conditions, which include lower prices because of retaliation from trading partners against Mr. Trump’s tariffs. The more fundamental problem is that, at its inception, the RFS assumed that ever‐​rising U.S. gas consumption would permit refiners to absorb huge amounts of ethanol. In fact, the year after Congress adopted the bipartisan RFS legislation, the U.S. economy went into a recession, causing a collapse in the number of miles Americans drove and the amount of fuel consumed per capita. Only last year did consumption return to pre‐​recession levels.   
  
  
Refiners face high and rising costs when they are forced either to mix more ethanol into their motor fuels or to buy offsetting credits known, obscurely, as Renewable identification numbers (RIN). Plagued by volatility and manipulation, the market for RIN has turned into a major headache for smaller refiners, which often seek waivers of the ethanol blending requirement. The entire system adds enormous bureaucracy and complexity to the fuel market, with little or no benefit to consumers. E15, as the 15 percent ethanol blend is known, might cost less per gallon, but because of its lower energy content, motorists would probably get poorer mileage and have to fill up more often.   
  
  
The petroleum industry has promised a lawsuit to stop Mr. Trump’s plan. While we hesitate to take sides between agribusiness and Big Oil, in this instance public policy clearly favors the latter.

"Mangroves are incredibly productive coastal ecosystems found in the tropics and subtropics. These dense green forests are known for their bizarre-looking roots that poke up into the air from shallow water. Among the meshed webs of roots are fish nurseries, enabling humans to make a living from the marine life in and around the mangroves. Mangroves also play another important role for humans, protecting communities from major storms. Climate change is more than rising temperatures, and the increased frequency and intensity of cyclones, hurricanes and typhoons is apparent. Cyclone Fani for example, which recently struck the Bay of Bengal, was one of the strongest to devastate India in the past 20 years. Mangrove roots can break up the force of a storm surge, soaking up some of its energy and protecting people living on coasts from cyclone damage. Yet it is a challenge to effectively value and protect individual mangrove ecosystems. And we just don’t have the people or funds to deliver detailed studies for even a fraction of the villages and towns sheltered by mangroves. That is where we need a global rule of thumb that can be applied anywhere. It needs to be rigorously evidenced, and trusted enough for economic values to be used in planning calculations by governments and financial institutions. This is provided for coastal mangrove protection by an innovative new study in the prestigious Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Jacob Hochard and colleagues use global data covering nearly 2,000 coastal communities in 23 countries and 194 mangrove areas. Meticulous statistical analysis of cyclones from 2000 to 2012 provides a convincing model of how economic activity is impacted and recovers. It is well established that how brightly lit an area is at night correlates to its economic activity. Hochard’s innovation is to compare satellite imagery data of nighttime light levels with a timeline of cyclones. Economic losses are estimated from reduced nighttime light levels. The area of mangrove protecting a community is divided by the length of coastline to give an average extent of mangrove per metre of coast. The authors compare how typical communities protected by smaller areas of mangrove (6m per metre of coastline average) fared over the long term versus communities with larger areas of mangroves (25m per metre average). As differing levels of wealth make it tough to directly compare the economic impacts of mangroves in, say, Florida and Haiti, Hochard and colleagues instead express losses not in US dollar value but as relative to months of economic productivity.  Losses per cyclone for communities with 6m of mangroves per metre of coastline were double that of communities protected by 25m per m of mangroves. In the former group, losses are somewhere between 5.5 and 6.5 months of economic activity. In the latter, the extra mangroves kept cyclone impacts down to between 2.5 and 5.5 months. Mangrove forests cover just 0.5% of the world’s coasts but account for an estimated 10-15% of coastal carbon capture. As we try to stop CO₂ levels rising and put the brakes on climate change, protecting mangroves for their blue carbon value is key. Mangrove protection from cyclones also reduces longer term deterioration of low-lying inland areas with rising sea levels. Storm surges and flooding from cyclones, which deposit salts, are greater without mangrove protection. In Bangladesh, for example, rice agriculture is increasingly impossible as fields are flooded with seawater. One way communities are adapting is to shift production to shrimp farms. Booming shrimp aquaculture, however, ironically requires further mangrove clearance to create space – as seen graphically in Sri Lanka. Loss of mangrove protection from cyclones then worsens coastal deterioration. Mangroves aren’t only lost to aquaculture, or harvested for wood, however. Mangroves are strongly affected, for example, by polluted freshwater flowing to the coast. Conflicting objectives at different levels of government and in different locations need joining up. And mangroves are just one aspect of coastal ecosystems and economies – effective management will mean integration with seagrass systems, coral reefs and so on.  The complexity is daunting. We need to be able to act using general principles that can be translated to the great majority of locations for which there are not the resources for local studies. Robustly evidenced global models such as this make that possible. The clock is ticking as mangroves are rapidly lost worldwide."

By Ed Hoskins, MA (Cantab)  BDS (Lond)
The UK Met Office long term Central England Temperature record has kept a continuous and consistent data set since the 1660s. It appears to be reliable and to have maintained its quality. It has not been adjusted as have so many other official temperature record.

Although the CET record covers only a small part of the northern hemisphere, it has shown a consistent rise since the end of the Little Ice Age in 1850 at a rate of about +0.45°C/century or about +0.67°C in the last 150 years. This rise accords well with other temperature records.
However since the year 2000, diminishing solar activity in solar cycle 24 (moving back towards little ice age patterns) appears to be having a real effect.

So since 2000 the CET shows an annual temperature diminution at the rate of -0.49°C/decade or -0.59°C in 12 years: this negates almost the entire CET temperature rise since 1850. Although this is a very short period, the extent of the climate change that has been observed since the turn of the millennium is remarkable.
Using the March 2013 CET value, it is possible to show the winter temperature values up until March 2013 with a combination of the four months December – March for the first 13 years of this century. The diminution of the four winter months temperatures is more remarkable at a rate of -1.11°C/decade or -1.41°C in the last 13 years. This compares with a winter temperature increase rate from 1850 to the year 2000 of +0.45°C/century or +0.68°C for the whole 150 year period.
There are substantial shorter term fluctuations in temperature, and since about 1850 world temperatures have been recovering from a Little Ice Age up by about +0.7°C up until the year 2000. These fluctuations have correlated well with solar activity observable by the number of sunspots. There was a particularly active solar period from about 1970 onward coinciding well with sunspot cycles 21 – 22 – 23: it led to comparatively rapid warming.

However the current cycle 24 is very much weaker and sunspots are diminishing to the levels of the earlier Little Ice Age.
According to some [2]: “so begins a Little Ice Age”. These colder conditions lead to a southwards diversion of the Jet Stream over Europe, as could be seen on 2/4/2013 [3], when the upper atmosphere air flow was passing over Northern Africa, rather than to the North of Scotland as is normal in warmer times.

Such a jet stream pattern leads to very wet summer conditions and remarkably cold winters as have occurred in the last 5 years throughout Northern Europe and the rest of the Northern hemisphere. This adverse colder climate could well persist for decades or even hundreds of years, as it certainly did for the pervious Little Ice Age.
Humanity has thrived in our current Holocene interglacial world. The comparatively warm last 10,000 years have been responsible for the development of the whole of civilisation. The GRIP [4] Greenland ice core data, supported reinforced by several other similar long term ice core records, show this effect very clearly.
Over the past 10,000 years the current Holocene epoch has been progressively cooling since the early “climate optimum”. Overall in the 10,000 years the world has cooled gradually by about 1.0 °C. There were other well documented temperature high points during the period, including the Minoan, Roman and Medieval warm periods.

However the most recent period of 1000 – 2000 AD was the coolest millennium of the whole epoch: see John Kehr the Inconvenient Sceptic [5].

A longer term record shows that only 13,000 years ago the world was in the depths of a real ice age with temperatures about 12°C lower than at present.
So interglacial periods of about 12,000 years have been occurring regularly about every 120,000 years. They are interspersed by real 100,000 year long ice ages, when vast ice sheets cover large parts of the world.
The previous Eemian interglacial epoch was some 130,000 years ago. At its peak it was about 3°C warmer than our current Holocene interglacial: hippopotami thrived in the Rhine delta. The Eemian also lasted about 12,000 years.
The pattern repeats itself [6], there have been 5 interglacial events in the last 500,000 years.

At ~10,500 years our current cooler but benign Holocene interglacial is coming towards its end and the reversion of our planet to a real ice age is foreseeable.

"**Lancaster could be moved into a lower tier than the rest of Lancashire when the government reviews its Covid-19 rules in December, a Tory MP has said.**
Council leaders asked for the county to be split into two tiers, reflecting different virus rates, on 2 December when the England-wide lockdown ends.
The government rejected that plan and Lancashire was placed into tier three.
David Morris said Lancaster could now be ""looked at separately"" if it sees improvements by 16 December.
The latest government figures show a wide difference across the county, with Hyndburn seeing the highest rate - 407.2 cases per 100,000 people - on 22 November, while Lancaster registered 102 cases per 100,000, the lowest rate in the area, on the same day.
Morecambe and Lunesdale MP Mr Morris said he had raised Lancaster's lower case rate during a ""helpful briefing"" with Health Minister Ed Argar and understood ""other factors"" meant the whole area had been placed in tier three.
The BBC has contacted the Department of Health and Social Care for further comment.
Lancashire politicians reacted angrily to the tier three announcement on Thursday, having made a case to the government for Hyndburn, Rossendale, Burnley, Pendle and Preston to be placed in tier three and Fylde, Wyre, Lancaster, Chorley, South Ribble, Ribble Valley and West Lancashire in tier two.
Health Secretary Matt Hancock set out the reasoning behind the decision in a written ministerial statement, with the first review of the tiering scheduled for 16 December.
In a statement on Facebook, Mr Morris said he had been given ""a commitment that if the epidemiology improves in the next two weeks in our area alone, it will be looked at separately to the rest of Lancashire"".
This will come as welcome news to politicians, residents and business owners in North Lancashire, who had begged the government to consider the area separately from the rest of the county.
Coronavirus rates in places like Lancaster, Morecambe and Wyre are similar to those in large parts of Cumbria, which will be placed in tier two.
Local politicians are now hoping that when the restrictions are reviewed after two weeks, ministers look at Lancashire as 14 separate boroughs rather than a single area.
In a similar move, Blackpool North and Cleveleys MP Paul Maynard has asked the government to explain why the town had been included in tier three after there had been a ""consistent and sustained decline"" in infection rates.
Blackpool had an infection rate of 205.1 per 100,000 people on 22 November, down from 291.2 per 100,000 a week earlier.
The Conservative MP said he wanted to see a more nuanced approach, as Lancashire was a ""significant geographical area made up of distinct and diverse communities"".
He added that the government should ""replace a pan-Lancashire approach with more localised tiers"".
Elsewhere, a number of the region's other MPs and political leaders continued to voice their frustration at the decision to put the whole county into tier three.
Chorley MP Lindsay Hoyle, the current Speaker of the House of Commons, confirmed he had written to the prime minister, asking him to review the Lancashire-wide decision, while deputy speaker and Ribble Valley MP Nigel Evans told the Local Democracy Reporting Service said putting his constituency in the highest tier was ""ludicrous"".
Lancashire County Council's Conservative leader Geoff Driver said he wanted local politicians to have more say in the decision-making process because ""we know our areas best"" and added he was ""naturally disappointed"" that the whole county had been placed in the same tier.
Rossendale Council's Labour leader Alyson Barnes also criticised the decision and called for more support for businesses.
Miles Parkinson, leader of Labour-led Hyndburn Council, said the virus was continuing to have ""a large impact"" on the area, but he did not want to ""prolong this suffering"".
Mr Parkinson, whose council area has the highest number of cases in Lancashire, added: ""The sooner we can bring our rates down and get restrictions eased the better.""

"**Department store Menarys has said it will have to close three branches as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.**
It operates 20 stores across Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.
Speaking on BBC Radio Ulster's Inside Business, managing director Stephen McCammon said there would be job losses.
""We are a business trading for 98 years and never in our history has there been anything quite like this,"" Mr McCammon said.
""It's been a very sad year and we've recently just entered consultation with staff in three branches which will regrettably have to close in the New Year because of Covid.""
Mr McCammon did not confirm which stores would be affected.
""These guys in our teams are extended family and I can't stress how difficult and how sad the year has been,"" he said.
""There will be quite a number of job losses as a result of that.
""We made this very clear to the executive whenever we were excluded from the multiple retail grant earlier on in the pandemic that that would come at the cost of jobs.""
The company said more than 50% of its business in Northern Ireland is closed as a result of current restrictions.
""These two weeks are very significant to us. Based on performance today we will probably take something like 20%, that's a decline of 80%, of what we would normally take,"" Mr McCammon said.
""The critical thing for now is getting through December with as much trade as we can manage."""

My blog yesterday on potential 2012 GOP candidates and the stimulus provoked a deluge of e‐​mails from fans of Sarah Palin objecting to my characterization of her support for the bill. And Palin’s office, responding to news reports (like this one from Fox News and the Associated Press that I relied on), put out a statement attempting to clarify her position. It wasn’t particularly successful.   
  
  
Palin does urge Congress to “consider” whether the stimulus bill is too big and burdens future generations with debt, but unlike some other governors (Sanford, Barbour, Jindal, for example), she does not call for the bill’s defeat or urge her congressional delegation to vote against it. Instead, she goes on to raise her big concern with the bill – it doesn’t give enough money to Alaska: 



“Governor Palin discussed troubling elements in the stimulus package including provisions that punish Alaska for forward‐​funding education, the mass transit funding formula that will limit Alaska opportunities but will pour money into other states, and the “shovel‐​ready” criteria for projects that northern climates might not be able to accommodate consistently due to the shortened construction season.”



Earlier Governor Palin sent a letter to her congressional delegation in which she similarly complained, not about the spending in the stimulus bill per se, but about the formulas for distributing the funds, which she believes short changes her state (as if Alaska were not already a wholly‐​owned subsidiary of the federal government.) She also wants the bill to include five specific projects (we used to call those “earmarks.”)   
  
  
So, I’ll stand (somewhat) corrected. Governor Palin didn’t lobby for the bill. She just lobbied for her share of the pork.
"
"

The federal‐​spending avalanche just pushed the government’s debt over $12 trillion, and Congress will soon have to vote on raising the legal debt limit. Spending has soared so high that 40 percent of this year’s budget will be funded by borrowing. The massive flow of red ink is prompting centrist legislators to rally around an ingenious plan to steer a big new tax hike through Congress.



The plan is for a bipartisan task force to design a large deficit‐​reduction package that would be fast‐​tracked through the legislative process to ensure a swift up‐​or‐​down vote in the House and Senate. In the House, more than 80 members have signed onto the idea, and in the Senate some members want to tie the creation of a task force to the upcoming debt‐​limit vote. Senators Kent Conrad (D., N.D.) and Judd Gregg (R., N.H.) are leading the charge, and they are backed by former heads of the Government Accountability Office and Congressional Budget Office.



In recent hearings, Senate Budget Committee chairman Conrad said that “everything would be on the table” for his proposed task force, including “tax reform” to meet the “revenue challenge we face from an outdated and inefficient revenue system” that is “hemorrhaging revenue.” Such a task force suffers from three fatal flaws.





The real solution is to change the incentive structure in Congress to encourage frugal behavior on a sustained basis.



The first is that the resulting tax increase would be on top of all the other tax increases on the table, including the scheduled rise in income‐​tax rates in 2011 and possible increases to fund health‐​care and climate‐​change legislation.



The second is that CBO’s long‐​term projections reveal a spending catastrophe, not a “revenue challenge.” As the economy recovers, revenues will rise to their historical norm of about 18 percent of gross domestic product and then keep on growing, even without any legislated increases. On the other hand, spending is expected to skyrocket from 21 percent of the economy in 2008 to at least 40 percent by 2050, or more if a new federal health plan is enacted. If Congress tried to raise taxes to match this soaring spending, the economy would enter a death spiral of declining growth and a shrinking tax base. Tax increases would be economic suicide in a global economy where American workers and businesses are already struggling to compete. Indeed, we should cut tax rates, particularly on capital, to generate the higher labor productivity and greater entrepreneurship we need to support the huge costs of baby‐​boomer retirement.



The third fatal flaw of a fiscal task force is that the government’s spending addiction cannot be cured in a one‐​shot treatment. If task‐​force proposals to cut spending were actually enacted, members of Congress would immediately go to work to reverse them. If a task force cut farm subsidies, for example, farm‐​subsidy supporters such as Senator Conrad would simply add them back in the next farm bill.



The real solution is to change the incentive structure in Congress to encourage frugal behavior on a sustained basis. One idea is to shake up congressional committees, which are the hubs of special‐​interest‐​spending pressures on Capitol Hill. Today, members get on certain committees — and stay on them for decades — because such positions give them the ability to direct federal dollars toward programs that benefit their states (or programs that they’re emotionally attached to).



Consider that the head of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Blanche Lincoln (D., Ark.), is from a heavily subsidized farming state and that she proudly boasts of her family’s farming heritage. Obviously, Lincoln and other members in similar situations aren’t going to balance federal taxpayers’ interests with those of program recipients in a neutral and dispassionate manner.



The solution to this conflict of interest is to have random assignment to all committees in the House and Senate and to impose term limits on committee membership. That would disrupt entrenched lobbying relationships on Capitol Hill, and it would populate committees with at least some members who could take an independent and critical eye to committee business.



Another way to change congressional incentives and encourage spending restraint is to enact a legal cap on the growth in the overall budget. Under a cap, Congress could not increase total annual outlays by more than the growth in some economic variable such as personal income, perhaps averaged over five years. If it did, the administration would be required at the end of the year to determine the amount of the excess and cut programs across the board to meet the cap.



It’s true that Congress could rewrite or suspend such a statutory cap if it didn’t want to comply with it down the road. But a cap would be a high‐​profile symbol of budget restraint for taxpayers to rally around and defend. It would be easy for concerned citizens to understand a law that said that the government’s budget shouldn’t grow faster than the average family’s budget.



Supporters of a task force argue correctly that we need new budgetary procedures to control exploding deficits. But rather than a one‐​time deal to raise taxes and provide probably temporary spending cuts, we need permanent changes to congressional rules and incentives. We should start by shaking up the pro‐​spending structure of committees and then cap the budget to force the trade‐​offs needed to avert the coming debt disaster.

"The plunging demand for oil wrought by the coronavirus pandemic combined with a savage price war has left the fossil fuel industry broken and in survival mode, according to analysts. It faces the gravest challenge in its 100-year history, they say, one that will permanently alter the industry. With some calling the scene a “hellscape”, the least lurid description is “unprecedented”. A key question is whether this will permanently alter the course of the climate crisis. Many experts think it might well do so, pulling forward the date at which demand for oil and gas peaks, never to recover, and allowing the atmosphere to gradually heal. The boldest say peak fossil fuel demand may have been dragged into the here and now, and that 2019 will go down in history as the peak year for carbon emissions. But some take an opposing view: the fossil fuel industry will bounce back as it always has, and bargain basement oil prices will slow the much-needed transition to green energy. Who is right depends on a heady mix of geopolitics, profit, investor sentiment, government bailouts and net zero emissions targets, campaigner pressures and, not least, consumer behaviour – is virtual working, for instance, the new normal? What is beyond doubt is the carnage in the sector. The lowest oil prices for almost two decades, with worse potentially on the way. Some oil major stock market valuations halved since January. At least two-thirds of annual investment – $130bn – dumped and tens of thousands of job losses. In a few markets prices have gone negative – sellers will pay you to take the oil, as global storage capacity fills. “The price war and Covid-19 have really thrown the oil and gas sector into turmoil, and now we have companies really in survival mode,” said Valentina Kretzschmar, director of corporate research at analysts Wood Mackenzie. Oil wells responsible for almost 1m barrels a day may have already been shut down because the price of oil is now lower than the cost of shipping it, according to US banking giant Goldman Sachs, with the number of wells growing “by the hour”. This is likely to “permanently alter the energy industry and its geopolitics” and “shift the debate around climate change”, said Jeffrey Currie, head of commodities at the bank. Demand for oil has plummeted as the coronavirus locks down people in their homes and airplanes on runways. “The virus will bring forward peak demand for fossil fuels,” said Kingsmill Bond, at analysts Carbon Tracker. This latest cyclical oil shock is hitting an industry already heading towards a structural peak created by nations committing to net zero future emissions, he said. “As for the impact of the virus on the timing [of peak demand], it depends of course on the severity,” he said. In 2018, Carbon Tracker estimated peak demand would come in 2023 but Bond said it was possible that the crisis has advanced this by three years. “That means that peak emissions was almost certainly 2019, and perhaps peak fossil fuels as well,” he said. “It will be touch and go if there can be another mini-peak in 2022, before the inexorable decline begins.” While the oil companies themselves have long argued peak demand is too far off to put a number on, most observers thought it would happen this decade. Mark Lewis, head of climate change investment research at BNP Paribas, agreed the crises could bring it closer. “When the dust settles, the peak demand narrative will be there stronger than ever,” he said. “This is particularly true if long-haul aviation fails to recover. This has been a very strong source of oil demand growth in recent years but the longer we are at home – remote working, using video conferencing – the more people will wonder: do we really need to get on a plane?” The oil price plunge has also demolished the lucrative returns on exploration projects to which investors have become accustomed. This threatens what Lewis calls the “golden dividend era” of the last two decades, which has made oil stocks mainstays of portfolios. Wood Mackenzie last week analysed the impact of an oil price of $35 on companies’ previous investment plans for 2020. “It’s a very, very ugly picture,” said Kretzschmar. “At $35 per barrel, 75% of projects don’t even cover the cost of capital.” Most strikingly, the fat rates of return projected for the oil and gas projects have slumped from about 20% down to 6%, she said. “They’re very much in line now with what you can get from solar and wind projects.” “The oil and gas sector is already a very much unloved sector by investors and in this kind of oil price environment, it becomes low return, high risk and high carbon,” Kretzschmar said. “It is not a very attractive proposition.” With oil prices predicted by some to collapse even further, Kretzschmar is blunt: “At $20 [the industry] will be decimated.” The oil industry was already under pressure from investors concerned about the climate crisis and increasing regulation from governments to cut emissions. Colin Melvin, at Arkadiko Partners, a consultancy advising some of the world’s biggest investment management and pension funds, said that after the crisis he expects investment to flow increasingly towards companies perceived to offer wider social benefits. “The purpose of the investment of capital in business is to create wellbeing, to create wealth in the true sense, and I think that is going to become more and more relevant to investors,” he said. Adam Matthews, director of ethics and engagement at the Church of England pensions board, said the implications for the oil and gas sector could be significant. “[Demand reduction] could be the catalyst for rapid change and I think investors are going to look at long term systemic challenges very closely and want to see much greater resilience.” As well as climate concerns, the wild instability of the oil markets provoked by the crises may also deter investors, according to analysis from the University of Oxford’s Institute for Energy Studies: “This is a market that is being tested to its limits.” However, not all experts think the oil industry’s loss is necessarily a gain for green energy and the climate. “If anything it may hold up the share of oil for longer, because it’s cheaper. It could be bad news from a climate point of view,” said Dieter Helm, professor of energy policy at the University of Oxford. He said securing a green economic recovery from the coronavirus crisis will require deliberate policy measures from governments: “This is where the carbon tax comes in. Now is the moment.” Governments are deploying stupendous sums to stimulate the coronavirus-wracked global economy - $5 trillion from the G20 nations alone - but how it is disbursed remains uncertain. European Union leaders have promised to make their emergency measures align with their Green Deal programme and Fatih Birol, executive director at the International Energy Agency, has said there is an “historic opportunity” to pour investment into energy technologies that cut greenhouse gas emissions. But the $2tn US coronavirus relief package is doling out $60bn to struggling airlines and offering low-interest loans that are available to fossil fuel companies, without requiring any action to stem the climate emergency. The Canadian government has said it will give loans to its oil companies, who say they are on “life support”. After the 2008 global financial crisis, there were high hopes that the trillions of dollars delivered at that time would green the economy, but fossil fuels and their emissions powered on, ever upwards. Bond said: “The big difference to 2008 is that the cost of renewables is now below that of fossil fuels. There is no point trying to sustain the unsustainable high-cost fossil assets in any event. It would be deeply ironic for [neoliberal] advocates of Ayn Rand to ask for a government bailout.” Adrienne Buller, an economist at the Common Wealth thinktank, said governments in countries like the UK, US and Canada should now consider nationalising major oil corporations. “Fossil fuel companies won’t be allowed to fail en masse.  Any bailout should at a bare minimum come with equivalent public stakes in the companies, and strong conditions for environmental and climate protections and a transition away from fossil fuel production. “However, given the intent of acquiring this stake should be to wind down production as rapidly as feasible while ensuring a just transition for workers and security of energy supply, nationalisation may be more appropriate and pragmatic.” The global industry trade body, the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers, insists its members have a vital role after the pandemic. “Oil and gas play a significant role in the global energy mix and will do so in the future,” said a spokesman. “It is too early to predict what the midterm impact will be. But the oil and gas industry has a history of successfully responding to difficult situations and we anticipate that it will adapt as it has before.” “Furthermore, the industry has been a key engine of prosperity and a driver of innovation for many decades,” he said. “It has the experience, skills, knowledge and resources needed to realise a low-emissions energy future - a transition that would be more difficult and more expensive without it.” Adding fuel to the fire of the pandemic is the price war being waged by Saudi Arabia and Russia, who increased production just as the pandemic slashed demand, sending prices towards the floor. The moves are seen as an attempt to grab market share by killing the higher cost producers behind the US shale boom. Prof Bernard Haykel, at Princeton University, US, said it also reflects a more fundamental strategic shift led by Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman: “With a global clean-energy transition inevitable, he is desperate to cash out while the Kingdom still can.” The lasting impact of the price war depends on how long Saudi Arabia and Russia can keep pumping cheap oil. While their production costs are very low, they depend on high revenues to balance their national budgets. Michael Liebreich, at Bloomberg New Energy Finance, said the fiscal break-even for Saudi Arabia is around $80 per barrel, meaning its foreign exchange reserves might sustain rock-bottom oil prices for only two or three years. “Russia, with a $40 a barrel fiscal break-even and much more diversified economy, can survive low oil prices for a decade,” he said. Whatever happens, the industry will never be the same again after the double whammy of the pandemic and price war. “The companies that emerge from the crisis will not be the ones that went into it,” said Carbon Tracker’s Bond. “We will see write-downs, restructuring and radical change.” Experts, including Currie at Goldman Sachs, say the climate change debate will almost certainly take a difference course after the crisis. But exactly what that looks like remains to be seen. “The question is how long this is all going to last, and no one really knows,” said Kretzschmar."

Share this...FacebookTwitterLately climate scientists have been telling us that cold weather is now evidence of warming, hard winters and big snowstorms, too.
Well, it turns out that the current global temperature stagnation is also now strong evidence of global warming. At least that’s what climate modeller Prof. Reto Knutti writes at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich blogsite in a piece titled: “Climate is (not) taking a break”, where he twists himself into a complex pretzel to explain why there’s been a global temperature stagnation. Hey, our models actually predicted it!

Prof. Knutti leads the Climate Physics group at the Institute for Atmospheric and Climate Science in Zurich. It focuses on climate modeling. See his publications here. Photo credit: Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich; Institute for Atmospheric and Climate Science.
In his blog article he starts by claiming that the stagnant temperature of the last 15 years: “…is nothing unusual: Also during the 20th century there were periods of stagnation, and even cooling. Even climate models show such behaviour – also for the future. So they do not contradict the long-term global temperatures.”
It wasn’t long ago that climate scientists were claiming things were “worse then we thought” and that the climate was careening out of control. Now that the climate is not changing at all, they are suddenly saying they aren’t surprised at all, and are even starting to claim their models had projected it.
Knutti even takes it a step further. In his piece he even tries to have us believe that the stagnation is actually evidence of warming! You see, from dozens of models, he managed to find one or two that foresee periods of stagnation interrupting the overall warming. He writes:

Not surprised…
Since the beginning of the 1970s, the global temperature has risen strongly. However in the last 10-15 years the trend has flattened out considerably. Depending on the year used as a starting point, the trend is practically zero. This is what temperature curves from the different institutes show. Even when there are some slight variations between the curves, they all show the same pattern [1].
The fact that the global temperature rise has stagnated does not contradict long-term climate change. To the contrary: Also in the future we have to anticipate short periods of stagnation or cooling. In principle, the science is not surprised by this finding. This is because such short-term temperature behavior also occurs in climate models (see chart). And that, by the way, in the same models that postulate an anthropogenic temperature increase over the long term.”
I placed the emphasis on “To the contrary” because it tells us that Knutti is claiming that because there is a stagnation today, and the models said there would be, the longterm-warming trend for the next 100 years has to be right. Such is the science of a climate modeller.
Here’s the chart he refers to, along with the text below it:

“Global temperature change in simulations from climate models from CMIP5 for the historical period (gray) and for various scenarios. Each line depicts a simulation. The observed data are depicted in black. As an example, one simulation, marked yellow, shows especially strong warming until the year 2000 and then followed by a period without warming over 20 years.”
Because the yellow model has it right, it has to mean that the modelled warming is correct – Knutti is suggesting. This is as preposterous as science could ever get. From dozens of models, he cherry-picks the one or two that support what he wants to believe.
One scientist has pointed out to me that there’s even a model that doesn’t show any warming until 2050. He wrote in an e-mail: “There is even one model curve which has hardly any warming until 2050. That must be their fall-back rescue anchor. If temperatures in 2050 are like today’s, then they will still claim they were right.”
So what’s the cause of the current stagnation?
Knutti proposes a variety of explanations: “Aerosols or also land-use. Then there are natural factors, like volcanos erupting or solar activity and internal fluctuations (weather). They all vary – and with it the annual temperature increase.”
Knutti also adds that the sun and El Nino phenomenon perhaps play a role in the stagnation. About temperature stagnations he even says: “They are to some extent a type of extreme event of the future.” And thus are evidence of climate change?
Of course, we don’t think for a minute Knutti himself actually believes the rubbish he is spewing above, i.e. stagnation supports the CO2 warming theory. At the end of his essay he even makes a confession, and opens the door to the possibility CO2 may be completely exaggerated:
It could be that the temperature reacts less strongly to changes in greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere than assumed (over-estimated climate sensitivity). Or to put it in another way: The climate models may be over-estimating the warming. The global temperature of the last 10-20 years is pointing in that direction, however it is precisely the models with the higher senitivity that are simulating the mean climate the best.”
PS: Here’s a chart of CMIP5, h/t a reader. Where’s the predicted stagnation?

There are really only two reasons to discuss greenhouse gas emissions (primarily carbon dioxide) in the context of dietary guidelines in the U.S., and yet the USDA and HHS did neither in their _Scientific Report_ of the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC).



The first reason would be to discuss how the rising atmospheric concentration of CO2 — a result primarily of the burning of fossil fuels to produce energy — is a growing benefit to plant life. This is an appropriate discussion in a dietary context as atmospheric CO2 is a fertilizer that promotes healthier, more productive plants, including crops used directly as food for humans or indirectly as animal feed. It has been estimated that from the atmospheric CO2 enrichment to date, total crop production as increased by 10–15 percent. This is a positive and beneficial outcome and one that most certainly should be included in any discussion of the role of greenhouse gases emissions in diet and nutrition — but is inexplicably lacking from such discussion in the DGAC report.



The second reason to discuss greenhouse gas emissions in a diet and nutrition report would be to dispel the notion that through your choice of food you can “do something” about climate change. In this context, it would be appropriate to provide a quantitative example of how the dietary changes recommended by the DGAC would potentially impact projections of the future course



of the climate. Again, the DGAC failed to do this. We help fill this oversight with straightforward calculation of averted global warming that assumes all Americans cut meat out of their diet and become vegetarians — an action that, according to the studies cited by the DGAC, would have the maximum possible impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and thus mitigating future climate change. Even assuming such an unlikely occurrence, the amount of global warming that would be averted works out to 0.01°C (one hundredth of a degree) by the end of the 21st century. Such an inconsequential outcome has no tangible implications. This should be expressed by the DGAC and mention of making dietary changes in the name of climate change must be summarily deleted.



We recommend that if the DGAC insists on including a discussion of greenhouse gas emissions (and thus climate change) in it 2015 Dietary Guidelines, that the current discussion be supplemented, or preferably replaced, with a more accurate and applicable one — one that indicates that carbon dioxide has widespread and near‐​universal positive benefits on the supply of food we eat, and that attempting to limit future climate change through dietary choice is misguided and unproductive.

"The record rainfall and persistent storms of winter 2013-14 caused serious flooding throughout the southwest of England, with breached defences, loss and damage to agricultural land, homes and businesses. A report by Deloitte as the waters receded in April put the cost at £1 billion pounds. Now a parliamentary select committee of MPs has published its report with recommendations for the way flood defence and drainage is funded and managed – many long overdue. The Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee argues that funds to maintain flood defences are inadequate, calling for a single fund that would allow flexibility between capital and revenue expenditure in any year for this vital area. The committee also recommend Defra give the impact of flooding of agricultural land higher priority, awarding what some would see as greater and overdue recognition to the social and economic aspects of the rural farmland areas. While extra funding has come from the government to protect and recovery flooded farmland, this is mostly money reallocated from other programmes in fairly opaque ways.  There are also demands for clarification of the responsibilities for maintenance and dredging of channels shared by landowners, the local Internal Drainage Boards, and the Environment Agency. Pilot schemes to give more responsibilities for channel maintenance to local landowners should be extended, with funding provided for channel maintenance by the drainage boards to be retained so that it can be handled locally.  The committee is unequivocal about the need to prevent any further losses to frontline staff. At the time of the floods, the Environment Agency was in the process of shedding many hundreds of staff due to government funding cuts. The floods caused a rapid review of this plan, with frontline flood management posts to be retained – at least for this financial year. The committee’s calls for “reassurances” from Defra are backed up by stating that, regardless of budget constraints “the avoidance of flood events that devastate communities should, as far as is possible, take priority over cost-cutting”. It is clear that the committee has particular sympathies with those rural communities affected by the floods, and sees channel dredging as a way of preventing the most devastating effects of flooding. The committee understands this is not a solution that will be useful everywhere, but they recommend that local land owners and drainage boards are allowed to keep channels clear by dredging.  But as part of its role, the Environment Agency is required to assess the benefits of capital investment and maintenance of flood defences, prioritising that which provides the greatest protection for the least money. As I have noted before, total flood defence is a myth: floods happen and will continue to happen and areas at risk cannot be defended in all cases. And so some spending prioritisation is required.    This raises the issue as to how far society as a whole should be responsible for protecting those who choose to live or base their businesses in flood risk areas. It’s understood that the existence of flood defences tends to promote further development in areas already at risk. This is not only an urban phenomenon – farmers in the Somerset Levels lost livestock and winter crops sown in land flooded because the defences were overtopped, land it was only possible to use because of the defences. But dredging the channels there will perhaps cost more than the value of what was lost, even if for the people concerned the impact is just as devastating. This is one reason why there will always be a preference towards protecting more built-up areas, because the benefits of investment in flood defence will be greater.  Not only can we not repel every flood, it’s even been suggested recently that the national benefit from flood protection, in terms of savings due to damage avoided, might have been overestimated. But there have been benefits.  Only 7,000 properties and businesses were affected by flooding last winter, while 1.3m were protected, compared to the 55,000 properties flooded during the 2007 floods. While the two events are not directly comparable, there were communities on some major rivers such as Bewdley on the River Severn that were flooded in 2007 but protected last winter due to investment in defences, permanent or otherwise.  On the other hand, some communities might have experienced flooding aggravated by flood defences elsewhere. The people in Wraysbury and Dachet on the River Thames, for example, feel flooding there was made worse last winter by the Jubilee River, designed to divert water away from Windsor, Eton and Maidenhead and built at a cost of £84m. This is just one example of why flood risk management in a river basin needs to be integrated, not considered only on a local basis. Otherwise excluding water from some areas upstream will increase the risk of areas downstream. The same applies to dredging. Dredging tidal rivers, including parts of the channels in the Somerset Levels, should be done with particular care. Greater channel capacity will, in that case, also allow the high tides to move further upstream and back up more of the water that is being expelled down the rivers. Where a discharge peak coincides with a extreme high tide, this could increase the risk of overtopping embankments.  Dredging will also have a significant impact on the river ecology. The Environment Agency has a responsibility under the 2003 Water Environment Regulations to improve all rivers towards a healthy ecological status – a requirement that may well conflict with dredging a channel. The select committee’s report says nothing about such conflicting requirements, nor how they should affect investment by society as a whole. It has nothing to say about assessing cost-benefits of such investments. It has nothing to say about integrated management, preferring local management instead. And it says nothing about taking steps to prevent further development on flood plains, focusing only on improving and maintaining defences. It seems there are more lessons to be learned from the winter floods of 2013-2104 than the committee have recognised in this report."
"All chimpanzees eat animals at least sometimes, including anything from ants and termites to bushpigs and even baboons. Monkeys, in fact, are typically the most frequent item on the menu, and in some cases chimpanzees can eat so many monkeys they threaten to wipe out entire populations. One group in Senegal even hunts tiny, mouse-like primates known as bushbabies by using spear-like tools to first probe the holes the bushbabies hide in during the day, before reaching in to grab their prey. So chimpanzees are rightly known as resourceful eaters. But until now scientists had never observed them eating reptiles. That has all changed, thanks to a group of wild chimpanzees in Loango National Park along the Atlantic coast of Gabon in Central Africa. These chimps have recently become used to the presence of humans, which means scientists can now see them act exactly as they would in nature. And, writing in the journal Scientific Reports, a group of researchers say they have already observed behaviour not previously seen in chimpanzees.  These chimpanzees regularly catch, kill and consume tortoises that have been grabbed from the forest floor. For people like us, who also research chimpanzee behaviour, the discovery is particularly exciting because the animals obtain the tortoise meat by pounding the shell repeatedly onto a tree trunk until it cracks.  This sort of “percussive foraging” – the pounding of certain food items until a breaking point – has been seen in chimpanzees elsewhere, but never to obtain meat. For instance chimps in Senegal have been observed pounding baobab shells to extract the softer fruit-covered seeds inside. From Sierra Leone to the Ivory Coast, Western chimpanzees use stone and wooden hammers to crack open encased nuts from protective outer shells.  Broadly, this sort of pounding has been suggested as the first step towards more complex tool use that allowed early human ancestors to flourish. The question of why other chimpanzee communities do not do this too, despite the clear benefits of obtaining otherwise protected nuts, seeds – and now meat – remains unanswered.  This newly discovered percussive behaviour in chimpanzees leaves a significant damage pattern on the tortoise shell and potentially damages the anvil on which it was cracked. The evidence left behind is therefore of interest to us primate archaeologists who use archaeological techniques to understand the physical remains of non-human primates. Our work in this emerging discipline relies on material artefacts – shattered tortoise shells, for instance – to reconstruct contemporary primate behaviour in the same way we do for early hominins.   We have long assumed that reconstructing hominin meat-eating behaviour was dependent on our finding fossilised stone tools and cut marks left on processed animal bones. To this select list we can now add tortoise shell. Previously, scientists had looked at fractured turtle remains and argued the animals may have been an important part of early human diets, but the Loango chimpanzees provide us a glimpse of the role this meat may have played for our early ancestors.  The new findings also reveal something even more remarkable. Among their observations, the researchers describe another novel behaviour, the storage of one of the tortoise shells in the fork of a tree that is later retrieved and consumed by the same male chimpanzee.  Such “future-oriented cognition” has long been considered uniquely human, but experimental evidence suggests other species, including apes and some birds, may possess it as well. If chimpanzees can indeed anticipate a future state (I will be hungry) as being different than their current one (I am not hungry), then a more nuanced interpretation of their cognition is required. Indeed, a careful study of the species may uncover many more examples of this future planning. It is now clear that with every new wild chimpanzee community that becomes used to humans, scientists observe new and unexpected behaviour – some of which challenges our understanding of evolution and what it means to be human. Furthermore, the difference in behaviour from group to group highlights the extraordinary cultural diversity among our closest living relatives.  The opportunity for comparisons with our own evolution has become a run against time as the human infestation of the planet threatens wild primate populations worldwide. We know that the presence of humans directly destroys not only the habitat and lives of primates but also leads to the loss of behavioural diversity. Conserving the last remaining populations of wild apes has become urgent, otherwise our fellow primates will disappear forever. With their extinction will disappear a part of their own heritage and a window back to our own evolution."
"**The NHS's former cancer director is concerned England could see the first decrease in survival rates for decades because of the Covid pandemic.**
In England, 60% fewer patients with suspected cancer were seen in April compared with the same month in 2019.
Prof Sir Mike Richards told BBC Politics East the drop ""will have an impact on cancer survival rates"".
NHS England said while some people were put off coming forward for checks, the NHS message was ""do not delay"".
Sir Mike, who was national cancer director in the Department of Health between 1999 and 2013, said it was too early to put a figure on what the overall effect on cancer survival would be but he said ""what we do know is that over the last 20, 30, 40 years, cancer survival rates in this country have been going up year on year"".
""There is obviously a concern that may actually go down again in the year 2020. But we won't know that for some time,"" he said.
""We know cancer has been hard hit during the pandemic. As soon as the first wave hit, patients weren't coming forward to their GPs so they weren't getting referred to hospitals.
""Diagnostic services were also hit. Surgery was much more difficult.""
Things have picked up since then, he said, and added: ""Instead of the steady rise that we have seen it is possible we could see some decline.""
Colin Allison, 64, from Swardeston in Norfolk, has a brain tumour touching his upper spine.
In February, he went to his GP with symptoms but because of Covid he could not get a scan until July.
""They phoned me a few days beforehand and said 'we're cancelling all routine MRIs',"" he said.
""But I said 'it's not routine - I've got symptoms coming back of a brain tumour'.""
As Mr Allison waited for a scan, symptoms such as double vision worsened. He said he was now waiting for an operation.
""Yes, Covid-19 can be life threatening,"" he said. ""But how many people are dying from cancer this year?""
The Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust said it had increased its MRI capacity after some diagnostic services were hit by the first wave of the pandemic.
It said it was investing Â£8m to replace its CT and MRI scanners with newer imaging equipment and added: ""We would welcome Mr Allison contacting us so we can look into his concerns.""
Fear of catching Covid-19 made the over-65s in particular reluctant to see their GPs during the initial stages of the outbreak, and cancer was most common in older age groups, Sir Mike said.
But he praised the way the NHS had ""done a great job"" to recover from that first wave, with latest data indicating cancer services were getting back to normal.
""In this country in any case we are behind other countries in our cancer survival rates, so there is a major catching up job to do on that anyway,"" he said.
""A lot of that is about making sure patients can get diagnosed earlier.""
He highlighted the shortage of scanning equipment in a recent report for NHS England. ""The figures are very stark,"" he said.
It showed that in 2017 England was at the bottom of a table of 23 developed countries for CT (Computerized Tomography) scanners per 100,000 population.
Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Spending Review on Wednesday announced extra investment in diagnostic equipment as part of a Â£6.3bn increase in NHS spending for 2021-22.
An NHS England spokeswoman said: ""Cancer survival rates are at a record high in England and the number of people being treated for cancer is now back to usual levels of activity.
""The NHS message to the public has always been clear - do not delay, help us to help you by coming forward for care.""

The civil unrest following last week’s police shootings of black men in Louisiana and Minnesota, followed by the sniper attack on police officers in Dallas, has sparked a new bout of public concern over the hardships of Black America. Those hardships include significantly higher violent crime victimization, higher joblessness, higher poverty, and lower income than the general U.S. population.   
  
  
Previous moments of such concern have prompted politicians to respond with the standard, tired slate of policies that supposedly would “empower” and “lift” African Americans. All too often, those policies mainly empowered government employees and vendors, while the gap between Black America and the rest of the country remains. By the time the policy failures became obvious, public and political interest had waned, and little else happened until new headlines brought new concern.   
  
  
Perhaps this time will be different, and policymakers will try some different ideas that might actually help. Cato offers many recommendations for reforming education, criminal justice, and the social safety net that would especially help black Americans.   
  
  
To those, add this simple, seemingly counterintuitive recommendation: _repeal the minimum wage_.   
  
  
Though some politicians deny it, the link between the minimum wage and unemployment is well established; denying that empirical research is akin to denying the research on climate change. Among the findings is that the minimum wage’s detrimental effects fall hardest on young black males: the same group that suffers some of the worst hardships of Black America. Perhaps if they had greater opportunities to take starter jobs that would give them both income and the work experience that leads to better‐​paying jobs, they’d have a better chance to escape violence and poverty. (Meanwhile, far too many young African American males are pushed into the black market, where they earn sub‐​minimum wages for dangerous work.) Indeed, the empirical work suggests that there’s a direct causal relationship between the minimum wage and crime.   
  
  
Repealing the minimum wage for the sake of black youth would be a great piece of historical closure. The minimum wage was established, in part, to push blacks and women out of jobs that progressives believed should go to white family men. The economic struggles of African Americans today reflect, in part, how well the progressives’ plan worked.

Jacinda is off to Tokelau this weekend. 



New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern will visit Tokelau this weekend. 



It’s the first trip to the territory by a prime minister since Helen Clark in 2004 and comes as part of the government’s Pacific Reset strategy.  
Announcing details of the trip on Monday, Ms Ardern acknowledged 15 years was a long time.  
“Tokelau’s remoteness and perhaps difficulty in accessing it has meant that it’s not had the attention that it deserves. Particularly as it is at significant risk of devastating impacts linked to climate change.” 



Jacinda Ardern said she will visit Tokelau’s three atolls and discuss priorities on climate change, health, education and culture.  
She will be there until 1 August. 



  
It sounds like a bit of overkill for a tiny, remote island in the Pacific. It may be a long time since anyone has visited, but surely that is because there is little reason to visit, right?



Well, no. Not so if you are Jacinda Ardern. The following excerpt is from March 2018.



Jacinda Ardern’s father Ross Ardern will step down as the High Commissioner to Niue when his tenure ends in May, **and has been posted to Tokelau.**  
The position in Niue would be taken over by diplomat and Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade agriculture development manager Kirk Yates.



  
Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters said the administrator’s role was to ensure appropriate public services were delivered to New Zealand citizens living in Tokelau, and to help manage the relationship between the two countries.  
“Mr Ardern’s experience as a High Commissioner, his extensive understanding of the Pacific, and distinguished career with New Zealand Police make him an ideal candidate for this role and I have no doubt he will make a major contribution to the relationship between New Zealand and Tokelau,” Peters said. 



  
So she is spending 6 days in the Pacific, celebrating her birthday, over the weekend. 



So which angle shall we take on this? We could start with the ‘jobs for the boys’ angle, as Ardern Senior was appointed to the role in May last year. 



Or we could go with the fact that this time she really is using the RNZAF 757 for what is obviously a personal trip, to get some family time and do very little… which is pretty much all she does anyway.



Can you imagine the howls of rage if John Key had done this? Even if this is a genuine diplomatic trip (which I really doubt) it is all about the look of the thing. She ought to know not to time her trip to coincide with her birthday, which is obviously family time.



But you have to have a competent media to drive that particular point home. And, as our media won’t call her out on this, we will.



Happy birthday, Jacinda. I wish you no ill will personally, but I hope there are not ‘many happy returns’ for you as prime minister. I’d like a prime minister that does some work, for a change.



If we had a decent media and a proper opposition, she would not be getting away with this.



After all, she was holidaying in the Cook Islands only last week. Seriously, how many holidays does this woman need?

"**While it may sound ""somewhat implausible"", Welsh house prices have risen recently despite the pandemic, according to the Principality.**
The building society puts it partly down to people looking for bigger homes with more space as they adjust to the ""new normal"" of working from home.
Rises are set to continue in 2021, according to house price index Zoopla.
It predicts sale values will increase by 2% in Wales, compared to 1% across England.
The Principality's chief risk officer Mike Jones said fears over jobs and the economy may make first-time buyers reluctant to ""put a first step on the ladder"".
But overall, he believes the furlough extension and schemes such as mortgage deferrals are two factors keeping the sector buoyant.
""It is also potentially the desire for a lifestyle change for some who, during lockdown, have realised that it is possible to work from home, avoiding the necessity to travel to work on a daily basis,"" he added.
""The demand for larger homes with additional space, including outdoor areas, has consequently risen however, and with little new supply coming to the market, prices also rose rapidly.""
When Wales' first lockdown ended in June, house prices rose by 3% across Wales' 22 local authority areas to Â£196,165.
The Principality's house price index for July to September showed sales rose by 2.2% compared to the quarter before - however, they were down by 58% on the same period in 2019.
In September, six local authority areas reached a new record average price - Bridgend (Â£190,948), Cardiff (Â£247,030), Carmarthenshire (Â£172,708), Gwynedd (Â£198,279), Newport (Â£213,660) and Powys (Â£222,992).
Apart from Cardiff, they are all among the council areas with the highest proportion of detached or semi-detached homes, indicating to the Principality the rise is being driven by people looking for spacious homes suited to lockdown living.
The highest increase was in Gwynedd, where house prices rose by 14.6%, with the price of an average detached home rising from Â£250,000 to Â£280,000 - this was pushed up by the highest sale of the year for Â£1.2m.
Mr Jones added: ""Covid is likely to have dented consumer confidence and fears over job security may mean that many prospective buyers will be reluctant to either put a first foot on the housing ladder, or indeed take a step up.""
However, he said help-to-buy schemes and the creation of affordable homes ""gave cause for optimism"" looking ahead.
Zoopla predicts Wales will record the strongest house price growth of all UK areas next year, partly due to pent-up demand because of a longer lockdown earlier in 2020.
Director of research and insight Richard Donnell called it a ""rollercoaster year"" that was ending on a strong note, with house price growth hitting a three-year high and set to increase further.
""There are some challenges ahead as the country battles the impacts of the pandemic on the economy and day-to-day life,"" he added.
""The impact on the housing market is less than in previous downturns as sales volumes have already fallen in recent years and affordability levels are far from over-stretched.""
Monmouthshire Building Society's chief operating officer Dawn Gunter called it an ""unpredictable year"" but agreed coronavirus had changed how many people view their home.
""Lockdowns have also meant members have spent more time than usual at home, with the home becoming both a personal and professional space,"" she said.
""Lots of people took the time to consider what the future looks like, how their home environment supports a positive work-life balance, whilst also considering its location and surroundings.""
She also said the building society had seen ""a surge in first-time buyers"", adding: ""We know the average age of a first-time buyer is now in their 30s, so 2020 may have been the target year to buy a first home for many."""

My local Wendy’s has a sign up saying tomatoes are scarce and will be offered only by request, and this is in California. So, this article by Marlo Lewis about sandwich shops in DC illustrates a nationwide effect. – Anthony
Can Tomatoes Take Any More Global Warming? By Marlo Lewis
Today, my friendly neighborhood Potbelly Sandwich Shop posted dozens of  small flyers along the ordering line, asking: “Where are the tomatoes?”  The flyer explained:

The recent cold weather across North America has had a severe impact on the availability, quality and cost of tomatoes.
Due to these factors, we will temporarily cease to offer tomatoes on  your sandwhich. As soon as the tomato crop returns to normal we will add  them back to your sandwiches.
We apologize for this inconvenience. We do not want to compromise on the quality or value of our sandwiches.
More evidence – if any were needed – that winter endangers public health  and welfare. Tomatoes are a great source of anti-oxidents and other  health-enhancing nutrients. And they are delish!
Besides ruining tomatoes, winter is strongly correlated with cold and  flu. Winter can also cause or contribute to power outages, travel  disruptions and delays, traffic accidents, and injuries from slipping on  ice.
You’d think that by now global warming would have made harsh winter  weather a thing of the past. Alas, no. Our tomatoes, and the health and  welfare benefits they bring, are still endangered.
But be of good cheer. The carbon dioxide emissions allegedly responsible  for Al Gore’s “planetary emergency” are helping tomatoes beef up. The  Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change maintains a  database on field and laboratory experiments measuring plant growth  response to CO2-enriched environments. Here’s the link for data on tomatoes.
A whopping 45 studies have examined the effects of CO2 enrichment on the  garden tomato (lycopersicon eculentum). On average, garden tomatoes  gain 32.
See the whole post here.
Joe D’Aleo writes:
Here is an approximate, preliminary look at the winter for the 90 days  ending february 26, 2011. December/January was the coldest in Florida  (winter vegetables) history and remember the frosts and freezes in  California and south Texas.

I’ll have more on the tomatoes and cold story coming up, a story about Mexico – Anthony

I learn something new every day. “Bodge” – here’s the definition from Wikitionary:
Etymology 1
The term “bodge” derives from Middle English boccen, which means “to mend.”
Verb
bodge (third-person singular simple present bodges, present participle bodging, simple past and past participle bodged)

(UK) To do a clumsy or inelegant job, usually as a temporary repair.



All the actions of his life are like so many things bodged in without any natural cadence or connexion at all. (A book of characters, selected from the writings of Overbury, Earle, and Butler, Thomas Overbury and John Earle, 1865)
Some cars were neglected, others bodged to keep them running with inevitable consequences (Original Porsche 356: The Restorer’s Guide, Laurence Meredith, 2003)
Do not be satisfied with a bodged job, set yourself professional goals and standards (The Restauration Handbook, Enric Roselló, 2007)





Noun
bodge (plural bodges)

(UK) A clumsy or inelegant job, usually a temporary repair.

Yeah, sounds about right. Here in the USA we have a website called “There I fixed it“, which could just as easily be named “There, I bodged it”.
Here’s what Steve McIntyre has to say about it:
==============================================================
Muir Russell and the Briffa Bodge
By Steve McIntyre
There has been some recent discussion of the Briffa bodge – an early  technique to hide the decline. I had drafted a post on the topic and its  handling by the Muir Russell “inquiry” in early July 2010, but did not  publish the post at the time. In today’s post, I’ve slightly updated my  July 2010 draft.

The term “bodge” was used for the first time in a comment (not a post) on November 8, 2009 by me here less than two weeks before Climategate). I had noticed the term “Briffa bodge” in a preprint of Briffa and Melvin 2008 2011 (see here), where it was used to describe a “very artificial correction” to Briffa’s widely used Tornetrask chronology as follows:
Briffa et al. (1992) ‘corrected’ this apparent anomaly by fitting a line  through the residuals of actual minus estimated ring widths, derived  from a regression using the density data over the period 501–1750 as the  predictor variable, and then removing the recent apparent decline in  the density chronology by adding the fitted straight line values (with  the sign reversed) to the chronology data for 1750–1980. This  ‘correction’ has been termed the ‘Briffa bodge’ (Stahle, personal  communication)!
Bodging of the Tornetrask chronology had been discussed in much earlier CA posts – e.g. in March 2005  here  and again here.
The term “bodge” also occurs in Climategate correspondence, as pointed out by Jeff Id on December 1, 2009 here.
In July 1999, Vaganov et al (Nature 1999) had attempted to explain  the divergence problem in terms of later snowfall (an explanation that  would seem to require caution in respect to the interpretation of  earlier periods.) On July 14, 1999, Ed Cook wrote Briffa as follows:
Hi Keith,
What is your take on the Vagonov et al. paper concerning the influence  of snowfall and melt timing on tree growth in Siberia? Frankly, I can’t  believe it was published as is. It is amazinglly thin on details. Isn’t  Sob the same site as your Polar Urals site? If so, why is the Sob  response window so radically shorter then the ones you identified in  your Nature paper for both density and ring width? I notice that they  used Berezovo instead of Salekhard, which is much closer according to  the map. Is that
because daily data were only available for the Berezovo? Also, there is  no evidence for a decline or loss of temperature response in your data  in the post-1950s (I assume that you didn’t apply a bodge here). This fully contradicts their claims, although I do admit that such an effect might be happening in some places.
Cheers,
Ed
See here for the response.
I raised the Briffa bodge as an issue in my  submission the Briffa bodge to the Parliamentary Committee and Muir Russell as an example of “data manipulation”.
Although Muir Russell expressed disinterest in opining on the proxy  issues that dominated the Climategate dossier, they reluctantly  expressed an opinion on Briffa’s adjustment of the Tornetrask  chronology, agreeing that the bodge was indeed “ad hoc”, but found  (without giving any evidence) that there was nothing “unusual about this  type of procedure”.  While I presume that this reassurance was intended  to comfort his audience, I wonder whether readers should in fact be  comforted by this observation.

"European politics has been seriously shaken up by this month’s parliamentary election. The centre-left/centre-right coalition that has dominated European political proceedings can no longer command a majority in the European Parliament. Eurosceptic parties, meanwhile, made smaller gains than expected. That has opened up an opportunity for Europe’s green parties, which made big gains and now hold 69 seats in the 751 seat chamber. This historic showing means environmentalist parties could hold the balance of power. Green MEPs sit in a transnational political group called Greens/European Free Alliance, together with MEPs from regionalist parties including the UK’s Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru. By far the strongest supporters of climate and environmental action in the last parliament, the alliance will seek to leverage its burgeoning influence on key EU policies. It could also play an important role in choosing the EU’s new personnel – including the successor to European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker. Environmentalists will be thankful that Brexit has been delayed until (at least) October, because it means that UK MEPs will probably still be around to play a part in choosing the new European Commission. The UK Green party delivered a particularly strong result, taking seven seats, along with the Scottish Nationalist Party’s three and one for Plaid Cymru. As a result, the Greens also now have more say over upcoming votes for the European Parliament’s president, 14 vice-presidents and 22 committee chairs that lead legislative negotiations on all policy areas. In the past MEPs have pushed for the Commission presidency to go to the lead candidate of the political group winning the most seats in the election, which would be the right-leaning European People’s Party’s Manfred Weber. But many EU heads of state (notably Emmanuel Macron in France, Pedro Sanchez in Spain and MArk Rutte in the Netherlands) are unhappy with this approach and would like the Parliament to endorse someone else. With no candidate able to command a majority by aligning with just one other party, political manoeuvring will be needed, in both the council and the parliament. With backing from the Green group, a strong challenge to Weber could be brought by a broad coalition between the centre-left and the centrist Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. As potential kingmakers, expect the Greens to try to extract environmental promises from leading candidates. Weber has very poor credentials on this front.  Once the new commission starts work in November, Green MEPs will have the opportunity to shape future EU policy. In the last European Parliament, the grand centre-left, centre-right coalition decided 74% of votes, leaving smaller groups at the fringes of power. With a more fragmented European Parliament, smaller groups will now be key to establishing a majority, and coalitions will be much more changeable. Despite the Greens’ rise, they remain a relatively small group. Their influence will depend on their ability to reach compromises with other parties when necessary – and to know when to pick their battles. Based on their past activities and their manifesto, two such likely red lines will be reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and the EU’s trade policy. During the last reform in 2013, the European Parliament weakened the CAP by making it easier for farmers to qualify for green subsidies without actually changing their practices. More recently, the agriculture committee has supported a proposal to automatically label 40% of CAP spending as “climate expenditure”, writing what Green MEPs called a “blank cheque” on climate change. Meanwhile, the European Commission sat on a report highlighting how little the CAP does for the climate for a year, quietly publishing it a day after the recent elections. This time around, we can expect the Green MEPs riding the resurgent climate wave to push for reform that puts delivery on climate change goals much higher up the agenda. The Greens are also strong critics of EU trade policy. They have long called for more democratic scrutiny and public consultation by the European Parliament to make trade more environmentally sound. They have pushed for a greater emphasis on improved labour conditions and trade deals which do not undermine the EU’s environmental and emissions targets. We can expect Green MEPs to hold other political parties accountable for their climate change pledges – and to influence the environmental requirements in EU trade policy in the future. Finally, as staunch defenders of the rule of law and the right to asylum, the larger Green group will also hope to exert influence on the EU’s long-awaited revision to its asylum system, and on how parliament deals with attacks on the rule of law in Hungary and Poland. The Greens will be keen to influence affairs as much as they can before the UK leaves the EU – when it will lose nearly 20% of its MEPs. They will also still be reliant on how seriously other parties now take the union’s climate and environmental commitments."

You couldn’t make it up. The **MAGICC** calculator was developed by scientists at the National Center for Atmospheric Research under funding by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the acronym stands for the **Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse-gas Induced Climate Change** ).



And they expect us to take them seriously?



This has not been developed by a bunch of derranged ‘deniers’; no, these are ‘proper’ scientists from the gummint.



This calculator estimates just how little warming would be averted for various reductions in CO2. A very large component missing from the argument against the climate catastrophe crowd is just how little the rise in temperature would be averted by the draconian measures that are proposed. 



You can download it or play online [here](http://www.magicc.org/).



Some boffins somewhere have run the calculations for the USA with these results (truncated):



Wikipedia says New Zealand is responsible for 37 Mt CO2 and Connecticut was the closest state to that number.



James and Jacinda’s grand plan is going to bankrupt the nation, but after the gas runs out, we will warm ourselves with blankets of smug, knowing that we have stopped a temperature rise of 0.0003C by 2050 when we are “Zero Carbon”. After that it will be a runaway success of 0.0007C by 2100.



Wow! Just WOW! I am so thrilled to be alive at this time to be able to do my small bit for preventing this **climate emergency**.



I was going to bake a cake and light some candles to celebrate but then I realised that my cake candles would raise the global temperature by more than 0.0003C and ruin the whole thing.

Share this...FacebookTwitterKlimaretter, the German catastrophe-obsessed warmist site that dedicates itself to “rescuing the climate”, has a story today of the ongoing bloodbath in the German solar industry, here.
Engineering giant Bosch issued a press release in English here, where it reports that a cooling global economy has slowed the pace of growth of the Bosch Group.
But the real damage has come from its solar arm: “a likely one billion euros of impairments and losses in the difficult photovoltaics business had a significant effect on the earnings situation”.
According to klimaretter.de, Bosch’s solar arm posted an operating loss of 450 million euros in 2012. In addition, the solar arm took unplanned special depreciations totaling about 600 million euros. Therefore the losses totalled more than 1 billion euros in 2012 alone. That comes on the heels of “impairments” of 560 million and 425 million euros in 2011 and 2010 respectively.
Klimaretter.de adds:
According to Bosch, the solar arm is currently worth zero euros.”
It goes without saying, the company’s 2000 solar workers now face an extremely precarious future. Already one plant in Erfurt was shuttered at the end of the year.
Instead of focusing on saving the planet from an imaginary climate catastrophe, one that is generated by dubious models concocted by environmental kook physicists, klimaretter.de perhaps ought to focus more on real issues, like rescuing German jobs by promoting sensible policies.

NOTE: This is the first in a series of monthly posts in which Senior Fellow Patrick J. Michaels reviews interesting items on global warming in the scientific literature that may not have received the media attention that they deserved, or have been misinterpreted in the popular press.   
  
_The Current Wisdom_ only comments on science appearing in the refereed, peer-reviewed literature, or that has been peer-screened prior to presentation at a scientific congress.   
  
**_The Iceman Goeth: Good News from Greenland and Antarctica_**   
  
How many of us have heard that global sea level will be about a meter—more than three feet—higher in 2100 than it was in the year 2000? There are even scarier stories, circulated by NASA’s James E. Hansen, that the rise may approach 6 meters, altering shorelines and inundating major cities and millions of coastal inhabitants worldwide.   
  
[caption align=right]  




Figure 1. Model from a travelling climate change exhibit (currently installed at the Field Museum of natural history in Chicago) of Lower Manhattan showing what 5 meters (16 feet) of sea level rise will look like.[/caption]In fact, a major exhibition now at the prestigious Chicago Field Museum includes a 3-D model of Lower Manhattan under 16 feet of water—this despite the general warning from the James Titus, who has been EPA’s sea-level authority for decades:   
  
Researchers and the media need to stop suggesting that Manhattan or even Miami will be lost to a rising sea. That’s not realistic; it promotes denial and panic, not a reasoned consideration of the future.   
  
Titus was commenting upon his 2009 publication on sea-level rise in the journal _Environmental Research Letters_.   
  
The number one rule of grabbing attention for global warming is to never let the facts stand in the way of a good horror story, so advice like Titus’s is usually ignored.   




The catastrophic sea level rise proposition is built upon the idea that large parts of the ice fields that lay atop Greenland and Antarctica will rapidly melt and slip into the sea as temperatures there rise. Proponents of this idea claim that the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), in its most recent (2007) Assessment Report, was far too conservative in its projections of future sea level rise—the mean value of which is a rise by the year 2100 of about 15 inches.   
  
In fact, contrary to virtually all news coverage, the IPCC actually anticipates that Antarctica will _gain_ ice mass (and _lower_ sea level) as the climate warms, since the temperature there is too low to produce much melting even if it warms up several degrees, while the warmer air holds more moisture and therefore precipitates more snow. The IPCC projects Greenland to contribute a couple of inches of sea level rise as ice melts around its periphery.   
  
Alarmist critics claim that the IPCC’s projections are based only on direct melt estimates rather than “dynamic” responses of the glaciers and ice fields to rising temperatures.   
  
These include Al Gore’s favorite explanation—that melt water from the surface percolates down to the bottom of the glacier and lubricates its base, increasing flow and ultimately ice discharge. Alarmists like Gore and Hansen claim that Greenland and Antarctica’s glaciers will then “surge” into the sea, dumping an ever-increasing volume of ice and raising water levels worldwide.   
  
The IPCC did not include this mechanism because it is very hypothetical and not well understood. Rather, new science argues that the IPCC’s minuscule projections of sea level rise from these two great ice masses are being confirmed.   
  
About a year ago, several different research teams reported that while glaciers may surge from time to time and increase ice discharge rates, these surges are not long-lived and that basal lubrication is not a major factor in these surges. One research group, led by Faezeh Nick and colleagues reported that “our modeling does not support enhanced basal lubrication as the governing process for the observed changes.” Nick and colleagues go on to find that short-term rapid increases in discharge rates are not stable and that “extreme mass loss cannot be dynamically maintained in the long term” and ultimately concluding that “[o]ur results imply that the recent rates of mass loss in Greenland’s outlet glaciers are transient and should not be extrapolated into the future.”   
  
But this is actually old news. The new news is that the commonly-reported (and commonly hyped) satellite estimates of mass loss from both Greenland and Antarctica were a result of improper calibration, overestimating ice loss by some 50%.   
  
As with any new technology, it takes a while to get all the kinks worked out. In the case of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite-borne instrumentation, one of the major problems is interpreting just what exactly the satellites are measuring. When trying to ascertain mass changes (for instance, from ice loss) from changes in the earth’s gravity field, you first have to know how the actual land under the ice is vertically moving (in many places it is still slowly adjusting from the removal of the glacial ice load from the last ice age).   
  
The latest research by a team led by Xiaoping Wu from Caltech’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory concludes that the adjustment models that were being used by previous researchers working with the GRACE data didn’t do that great of a job. Wu and colleagues enhanced the existing models by incorporating land movements from a network of GPS sensors, and employing more sophisticated statistics. What they found has been turning heads.   
  
Using the GRACE measurements and the improved model, the new estimates of the rates of ice loss from Greenland and Antarctica are only about _half as much_ as the old ones.   
  
Instead of Greenland losing ~230 gigatons of ice each year since 2002, the new estimate is 104 Gt/yr. And for Antarctica, the old estimate of ~150 Gt/yr has been modified to be about 87 Gt/yr.   
  
How does this translate into sea level rise?   
  
It takes about 37.4 gigatons of ice loss to raise the global sea level 0.1 millimeter—four hundredths of an inch. In other words, ice loss from Greenland is currently contributing just over one-fourth of a millimeter of sea level rise per year, or _one one-hundreth_ of an inch. Antarctica’s contribution is just _under_ one-fourth of a millimeter per year. So together, these two regions—which contain 99% of all the land ice on earth—are losing ice at a rate which leads to an annual sea level rise of one half of one millimeter per year. This is equivalent to a bit less than 2 hundredths of an inch per year. If this continues for the next 90 years, the total sea level rise contributed by Greenland and Antarctica by the year 2100 will amount to less than 2 inches.   
  
Couple this with maybe 6-8 inches from the fact that the ocean rises with increasing temperature, temperatures and 2-3 inches from melting of other land-based ice, and you get a sum total of about one foot of additional rise by century’s end.   
  
_This is about 1/3 rd of the 1 meter estimates and 1/20th of the 6 meter estimates._   
  
Things had better get cooking in a hurry if the real world is going to approach these popular estimates. And there are no signs that such a move is underway.   
  
So far, the 21st century has been pretty much of a downer for global warming alarmists. Not only has the earth been warming at a rate considerably less than the average rate projected by climate models, but now the sea level rise is suffering a similar fate.   
  
Little wonder that political schemes purporting to save us from these projected (non)calamities are also similarly failing to take hold.

Share this...FacebookTwitterUlli Kulke, veteran journalist at the German flagship daily DIE WELT, posts a comment at his blog on über-alarmist Stefan Rahmstorf’s claim that “sea levels are rising 60% faster” than previously thought in 2007.

Sea levels have decelerated over the last years. Chart source: http://sealevel.colorado.edu/.
Being a devout alarmist, Rahmstorf is obsessed with finding ways to produce spectacular headlines. In Germany scary climate headlines have become a tradition every November, just before every major climate conference. Doha this year is no different.
In his latest claim, Rahmstorf claims that just a few years ago, sea levels were thought to be rising 2 mm/year. Suddenly the sea level, the satellites say, is actually now rising at 3.2 mm/ year – that’s 60% faster then they thought!
But as Kulke points out in his piece titled False climate alarm surrounds an old hat, Rahmstorf is suffering from (selective) amnesia, and forgot what he said in the UN-IPCC report of (2007): Rahmstorf back then:



<!--
google_ad_client = ""ca-pub-3545577860068042"";
/* neu test */
google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";
google_ad_width = 200;
google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




Satellite measurements show a rise of 3.1 mm/year for the period 1993-2003 – and if you consider the measurements through 2006, it’s even 3.3 mm/year.”
Kulke writes, with a bit of sarcasm:
It was, after all, quite some time ago, and there was so much data in that thick report. Also with sea levels – some numbers were lower and some were higher. But Rahmstorf, the ocean scientist, had been lead author in every climate report. For this reason the data shouldn’t be anything new for him. Back then the report projected an increase of 18 – 59 cm for the coming century.
Alarm, Alarm. Let’s increase the growth of data. Or, to speak like Honecker (leader of former communist regime East Germany): Always higher, never lower! And if it’s not possible to increase the current data, then let’s just reduce the data of the past. Just like some climate scientists also want to reduce the temperature of the hottest year since instrumental measurements began, namely 1998, just so that this decade can once again appear to be on the rise. Or just like Michael Mann tried with his infamous hockey stick – but failed.”
If we take Rahmstorf’s 1993 – 2006 period value of 3.3 mm/year, then we see that sea level rise has actually slowed down by 3%, and not risen 60%. The tricks being used by alarmist climate scientists are becoming ever more obvious and desperate.
You don’t need to be an investigative journalist to uncover that.

Thanks to a knowledgeable commenter, **Bryan** , on Backchat the other night, [this map](https://teara.govt.nz/en/zoomify/33583/confiscation-map-1869) was drawn to our attention. It is most informative.



The text under the map says:



This **historical map** shows tribal boundaries and the areas that were **confiscated from Maori during the 1860s**. The blue boundaries have been added in modern times to identify the areas in which the confiscations took place. It notes that Waikato, the domain of the Kangitanga (Maori King movement), had 1,217,437 acres (492,679 hectares) confiscated.



  
Let’s zoom in a bit:



Well, that’s inconvenient! 



What does the SOUL protest website have to say about this land?



In 2014 Auckland City, using the Special Housing Areas Act, designated 32 hectares adjacent to the **Otuataua Stonefields Historic Reserve** (OSHR) as a special housing area (SHA. **This land, known as Puketapapa, was confiscated ‘by proclamation’ under the New Zealand Settlements Act in 1863** as part of the colonial invasion of the Waikato that drove mana whenua of South Auckland from their lands ahead of the settler armies. 



  
These protesters may have other valid reasons why they want the land protected:



It is important to understand that this land is a crucial part of one of the last remnants of the archaeologically rich stonefields landscape across Auckland and, as a natural component of the adjacent but legally separate OSHR, it holds the stories of the earliest inhabitants of our country. The OSHR protects the places where the first Maori gardeners lived and worked using the stones and the microclimates they created to grow their Pacific Crops. SHA62 similarly is one of the last surviving places where the land and stone walls used by Maori for growing new crops such as wheat and European vegetables for the Auckland markets prior to 1863, still exists. It is of special significance in that here the ancient and more recent gardens stand next to each other. These places are even rarer than the stonefields were at the time of the creation of the Otuataua Stonefields Historic Reserve. 



  
But, according to history recorded at the time, ‘confiscation’ of Maori land by Pakeha is not a valid reason. Revisionist history might want to claim something else but it seems that the facts are the opposite of what is being claimed by the rent-a-mob shambles in South Auckland.

Poll now closed. Results below will be submitted to ARCUS on Sept 1st.

Once again, I’m going to give WUWT readers an opportunity to make a forecast for submission, based on voting. See the poll at the end. I’m late getting this online this month as other things took precedence.
For reference, here’s last months forecast poll and the final submission with all other forecasts from other groups. The final forecast poll you can participate in follows.

The value used by ARCUS in the forecast is the NSIDC value as they say here:
The sea ice monthly extent for September 2010 was 4.9 million square kilometers, based on National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) estimates.
So don’t be using the JAXA graph to forecast minimums, though it it useful for determining short term trends as it is more responsive than the NSDIC graph below, which is averaged.
Right now the NSIDC value is about 5 million square kilometers.
[ UPDATE: NSIDC’s Julienne Strove from NSIDC writes in comments:
“Note, the NSIDC value today is 4.66 million sq-km.”
Of course NSDIC doesn’t publish the daily values like JAXA does, so we all have to guess since we aren’t privy to that information.
The 5 day average graph is all the public gets. And of course, any estimate is hampered not only by the average, but also by those coarseness of the Y axis. I’ve asked before for NSIDC to publish the daily value and the response has been that they have more important issues to attend to.  However, clearly the ARCUS forecast group is watching this number and it is important to the final forecast done by over a dozen groups now. So you think it would be valuable to post the daily data. -Anthony]

Here’s the latest JAXA graph: 

JAXA AMSR-E Sea Ice Extent -15% or greater – click to enlarge
Here’s the poll for the ARCUS August outlook, it will run until Sept 1st at midnight PST.
(NOTE/UPDATE: This poll was originally exactly like all the others done over the last several months, but one snarky commenter (the first one) complained that I was a “manipulator” because it didn’t have more lower values. Of course he never bother to ask why or look at the history of the other polls.
I had considered initially adding those lower values for this poll, but then figured I’d be derided for changing the poll and not being consistent with the other polls. In retrospect, I’ll be criticized no matter what I do, so within 20 minutes of it going online, I decided to extend this poll with 0.1 million km increments down to 4.0 million kilometers. I’ve also removed the options for voting 5.5 to 6.0 (which existed in prior polls) since they are outside the current bounds of possibility based on previous September history.  – Anthony

"Green growth has emerged as the dominant narrative for tackling contemporary environmental problems. Its supporters, including the likes of the UN, OECD, national governments, businesses and even NGOs, say that sustainability can be achieved through efficiency, technology and market-led environmental action. Green growth suggests we really can have our cake and eat it – both growing the economy and protecting the planet.  But when it comes to tackling the most pressing environmental problems such as climate breakdown, species extinction or resource depletion, green growth might weaken rather than strengthen progress. Here are five reasons why: In theory, advances in environmental efficiency can help to “decouple” economic growth from resource use and pollution. But such outcomes remain elusive in the real world. While sectors such as construction, agriculture and transport have managed to create less pollution and use less resources per unit of output, these improvements have struggled to fully offset the scale and speed of economic growth. By outpacing production improvements, economic growth has led to an unhampered rise in resource use, pollution, and waste.  In fact, efficiency may even be fuelling further consumption and pollution. This is a paradox first observed in 1865 by the economist William Stanley Jevons, who noticed the introduction of a more efficient steam engine actually coincided with more coal consumption, not less, as new profits were reinvested in extra production, causing prices to fall, demand to rise, and so on. Such “rebound effects” exist across the whole economy, so the only real solution is to consume less. At best, efficiency is a half-baked solution, at worst, it stokes the very problem it tries to address. Proponents of green growth want us to believe that ever better technology is the solution. However, we are not so sure. International environmental agreements and scenarios confidently assume large scale technologies will be deployed to capture and store carbon emissions, but we have yet to witness their potential even on a small scale. Mechanised agriculture is being promoted on the basis of increased efficiency and yield while overlooking the fact that low-tech farming is a more productive means of meeting global food demand at lower environmental cost.  Clearly, technology is crucial in lowering the environmental burden of production and consumption, but green growth overstates its role. Perhaps the most compelling argument put forward for green growth is that protecting the environment can go hand-in-hand with making profits. However, in reality there is often a tension between these goals. Many firms are risk averse, for instance, and don’t want to be first-movers, whether on charging for plastic bags, banning plastic cups or introducing carbon labelling.  Then you have the fact that some sustainable interventions are simply not attractive investments for the private sector: there is little profit to be made in conserving ecosystems or financing public infrastructure for electric vehicles. Meanwhile, environmental risks like natural resource depletion or extreme weather might become increasingly attractive to part of the private sector.  If we’re serious about living within environmental limits we need to say adios to certain sectors: fossil fuels, livestock and fertilisers. If we leave that to the market, we’re going to be waiting a long, long time. Buying “green” offers a seemingly common sense solution to the environmental ills of over-consumption, but we’re sceptical. The push for greener consumption has devolved responsibility from governments and business to ordinary people. As one commentator put it, we have been conned into fighting environmental issues as individuals, while the real culprits get off scot-free.  Indeed, the very act of green consumption still fuels the extraction and use of natural resources, pollution and environmental degradation. Stuff requires more stuff to produce – this is often overlooked when we buy re-useable cups, eco-appliances and “sustainable” clothing. Any positive impacts of green consumption can also easily be undone through people feeling they have a moral license to indulge elsewhere. Green consumption is a zero sum game if we decide to go vegan then fly long haul. While it’s misguided to think consumers can’t make a difference, we shouldn’t be fooled into thinking humanity can consume its way out of environmental problems. A central principle of green growth is that markets are both part of the problem and solution. Proponents of green growth argue that as long as we get the numbers right – a tax on carbon, a clean energy subsidy, or a price tag on nature – markets can foster sustainability. But tackling environmental problems through the market involves a lot of guesswork with no guaranteed outcome.  Unlike carbon, ecosystems and biodiversity are not amenable to economic valuation and substitution within markets. Pricing environmental damage in markets is like selling permits to pollute and trash our natural world. Although market mechanisms can guide business towards sustainable behaviour, only stringent laws and regulation can help bring their growth in line with environmental limits.  Efficiency alone is a blunt tool and techno-fixes will also not get us where we need to be. We need to address the elephant in the room: consumption. As the business case for reducing consumption is poor, governments and communities need to take charge.  There are promising signs. The next major Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment report will finally include a chapter on tackling consumption. In the UK, the Committee on Climate Change’s report on net zero by 2050 highlights the critical need for societal change. Questioning our appetite for growth is the first step towards a more inclusive and effective model for sustainability.   Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt’s Die kalte Sonne site recently posted an article about the East African drought, which, as it turns out, is all part of a natural cycle.
================================================
New Study in Nature: East African Drought Trend Part of a Natural Cycle
By Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated, edited by P Gosselin)

Figure 1: Moisture development of East Africa over the past 700 years. Source: Tierney et al. 2013.
East Africa has gotten drier over the last decades, suffering from drought. Those responsible for this misery were quickly found: It had to be man. His rising CO2 emissions must have irreversibly damaged the East African climate, and driven the rains off for good. This is pretty much how many environmental and aid organizations have been arguing, e.g. Aktion Deutschland Hilft or Greenpeace. Of course, you don’t have to be a marketing expert or psychologist to see the real intentions of these accusations. With feelings of guilt, donations come pouring in.
Now a new publication in the journal Nature casts serious doubt on the supposed man-made East African drought assumption. US scientists from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, led by Jessica Tierney, have taken a closer look at moisture trends in East Africa and have uncovered a surprise. Using geological reconstructions, the scientists were indeed able to confirm that East Africa has dried out during the past decade. However, the group also succeeded in reconstructing the data all the way back to the year 1300 (See Figure 1 above).
As Figure 1 shows, the drought of the last decade is simply all part of a broader natural cycle that has been occurring over hundreds of years. Contrary to what was assumed earlier, the drying out did not first begin in the second half of the 20th century, but already at the end of the 18th century. A pronounced wet period prevailed in East Africa between 1680 and 1765 (Figure 1), which corresponds to the Little Ice Age – a time when global mean temperature was more than 1°C colder than today. Interestingly, East Africa was just as dry back in the 14th and 15th centuries as it is today. Clearly CO2 could not have been responsible for that.
Therefore Jessica Tierney and her team started looking for a natural driver for East Africa’s moisture development. They compared the drought data with the temperature development in the Indian Ocean. Lo and behold: both curves showed a high degree of similarity. Obviously the rain in East Africa is driven significantly by the Indian Ocean. Whenever the India Ocean is cool, the rains in East Africa increase. And when the Indian Ocean is warm, the rains become more seldom (see Figure 2):

In turns out that the temperature curve of the Makassar Strait near Indonesia also closely reflects global mean temperature (Figure 3). During the Medieval Warm Period and the Modern Warm Period, drought conditions prevailed in East Africa. But wet conditions ruled during the Little Ice Age. We also know that this climatic behavior over decades and centuries happens to follow solar activity. Thus moisture development in East Africa is mainly driven by solar activity.
Unfortunately the authors of this Nature study “forgot” to mention it – even though it’s made obvious by the data. The results are no surprise because numerous other studies from different parts across the world show the same distinct patterns, for example: here, here, here, and here, just to name a few from many.

"Nearly two years ago, ClimateWorks Australia set out to test whether the implied goal agreed by world leaders at the Paris climate conference – cutting greenhouse gas emissions to “net zero” by 2050 – was still possible in Australia. They weren’t certain it would be. They were pleasantly surprised by the result. “We found not only is it not yet out of reach in Australia, but it can be achieved using technologies that are mostly already mature and available,” says Anna Skarbek, the chief executive of the not-for-profit that was established in 2009 to fill a gap between climate research and action.  Net-zero emissions targets have been adopted by 121 countries responsible for a quarter of CO2, asset owners worth $4tn and an expanding list of major companies. The Morrison government is yet to join them, having promised a long-term strategy later this year, but all Australia’s states and territories have net-zero goals for mid-century. ClimateWorks spent 18 months examining each part of the Australian economy in detail to consider what would be involved in getting there. The resulting report, Decarbonisation Futures, is an update of similar work in 2014. It found net-zero emissions were possible not just by mid-century but by 2035 – soon enough for Australia to play its part in an effort to limit global heating to 1.5C. The report lands as the coronavirus crisis has, in a best-case scenario, postponed 2020’s expected focus on climate change. The year-end UN meeting in Glasgow has been delayed until next year. It is considered the most important since Paris in 2015, with countries being exhorted to ramp up commitments as promised in the French capital.  ClimateWorks’ analysis was completed before the pandemic hit, but Skarbek says the need to recover from the economic shock once the survival stage passes will also provide an opportunity to make the sort of investment required to respond to the climate crisis. The former will demand a substantial stimulus program. The latter requires an “all-in” approach from governments, business and individuals in what the report calls “the transformational decade” before 2030. After that, the window for Australia to do its bit towards the Paris targets and prepare for a coming global zero emissions economy may have closed. Skarbek says it means a “make or break moment” is coming. The good news, she says, is many transformational climate-friendly steps are stimulus-ready. “If we get this right, we can meet Australia’s international climate change commitments, create jobs in sustainable industries, and set ourselves up for a smoother and speedier shift to a zero-emissions economy,” she says. “If we miss the moment of the stimulus injection to also accelerate on climate, the downturn will make it even harder to do what is needed over the next decade. I do worry we might miss this chance forever if we don’t seize it now.” The report finds the progress and fall in cost of clean technology since the last analysis six years ago has been faster than expected, with renewable energy becoming cheaper than fossil fuels and the cost of batteries plunging 80% in a decade. It says much of the shift needed now could be rolled out quickly by rapid and large-scale deployment of familiar technology. It would include upgrading homes and commercial buildings to boost energy efficiency and run on solar power; building more large-scale clean energy plants and storage; installing electric vehicle charging stations; boosting the use of recycled goods in supply chains; and supporting more carbon forestry by planting and protecting trees to store CO2. “It’s a lot of relatively small transactions that get this job done,” Skarbek says. “That’s why it is stimulus-friendly.” The analysis found the difference between making cuts consistent with 1.5C and 2C of heating were noteworthy, but not always that great. The lower goal was likely to mean renewable energy providing 79% of power by 2030, compared with 73% for 2C and 48% if we continue on the current path without governments introducing further policies. On electric vehicles, a 1.5C path could require three out of every four new cars sold in 2030 being electric, compared with one out of two on a 2C path. The government has projected EVs will make up one in five new sales by then. Deployment of available tech to make rapid cuts in electricity, buildings and transport is easier than in heavy industry, agriculture and the land, but Amandine Denis-Ryan, ClimateWorks’ head of national programs, says there are emerging solutions in those areas. One may be hydrogen, which governments are backing as a potentially plentiful clean energy source for use in transport and industry, and to export. While the report acknowledges green hydrogen is likely to have a part to play, it does not assume how big that role will be, given it is a relatively new industry and there is little data to back it up. But Skarbek says it is a potential answer to two big questions: what can be done in those parts of the economy, particularly in heavy industry, that cannot easily shift to running on clean electricity? And what industries can fill the gap created by Australia’s reliance on fossil fuel exports? Denis-Ryan stresses the report reveals both what is possible and the urgency of the task. Achieving the Paris goals will require national emissions being cut in half by 2030 at the latest. “We now know we have enough technological capacity in the Australian economy to get there,” she says. “But we need to get these technologies out the door at every opportunity.” The analysis found electricity is key – getting to 100% clean energy will help clean up other parts of the economy. It suggests no significant increase in storage is needed to get from where we are today, at about 25% clean energy, to 50%. Pumped hydro and batteries are mature and available technologies for when that boost is required. Hydrogen may play a role, and demand-response programs, microgrids and inertia control technology are all considered at demonstration stage and could be rapidly scaled up to improve grid security. But the key factor determining the pace of the electricity transition is the speed at which coal and gas plants are closed. The analysis suggests over-building renewable energy to 200% capacity – double what the country needs – could be more cost-effective than building to 100%, and would spark new clean export opportunities. As with electricity, the technology for zero-emissions building already exists. It would involve improving energy efficiency through insulation and draught sealing and by installing LED lighting, solar hot water and efficient heating, cooling and appliances. It could mean the introduction of passive house design standards to conserve energy, the use of electrochromic windows that allow owners to control the amount of light and heat that passes through them, and smart systems that optimise when and how power is used. But much of it would be driven by a shift to clean energy, replacing gas-fired heating and cooking with heat pumps and induction stovetops. Transport is not as easy to tackle as electricity and buildings, but the analysis found it could reach near zero emissions by 2050 through improving travel practices (using more electrified mass public transport and video-conferencing for business), shifting to electric vehicles and replacing fossil fuels with biofuels, and possibly renewable hydrogen and ammonia. Industrial emissions have been rising rapidly in Australia, effectively cancelling out reductions in electricity generation and drought-affected agriculture before the coronavirus pandemic. They are harder to cut and would leave considerable “residual” emissions by 2050 based on existing technology. Improved efficiency, fast-tracking a circular economy in which metals, plastics and timber are recycled and reused and 3D printing plays a bigger role, electrifying mines and steel operations where possible, and shifting to renewable fuels are (to varying degrees) available solutions that could lead to deep cuts. Immediate cuts are possible through better use of energy, including onsite renewables at farms, substituting some meat products for plants and better management of waste and fertiliser. Other changes such as using vaccines to limit methane from livestock, and shifting to lab-grown meat, are emerging technologies and need greater support for rapid rollout. Reaching net-zero emissions in the medium-term would involve expanding use of forests to store carbon to offset the sector where, based on today’s technology, the complete eradication of CO2 is not yet possible. But the report warns this is a temporary solution. The country cannot reforest land forever, and trees are vulnerable to bushfires, drought and heatwaves, which are exacerbated by climate change."

Trade union and chemical industry bosses in Germany warn Merkel of the consequences of high electricity prices. Source: Wikipedia, public domain photo
Processing chemicals, however, sometimes involves large amounts of energy. Therefore, in their quest to provide customers with affordable products, processing companies need affordable energy. Today this is no longer available in Germany, which has taken a blind leap into renewable energies. Now electricity rates are skyrocketing out of control.
Spooked, chemical processing companies and the labor unions in Germany have sent an urgent letter to Chancellor Merkel, so writes Der Spiegel here. Hat-tip: Karl Rannseyer at Facebook. Spiegel writes:
The letter to the Chancellor is anything but friendly: According to a newspaper [Handelsblatt] report, the chemicals sector has warned Angela Merkel of rising electricity costs due to the energy transformation to renewables – the competitiveness of the branch is at stake.”
The letter warns:
If the chemicals industry loses its competitiveness, not only Germany as an address for production and research will be at stake, but also the entire industrial network as a whole will be dragged into into a painful situation.”
The letter was signed by the President of the German Association of Chemical Industries (VCI), Klaus Engel; by the head of the Chemicals Trade Union IG BCE, Michael Vassiliadis; and the President of the Federal Employers Association for Chemicals, Eggert Voscherau.

"Irradiated plants taken from the evacuated areas around the stricken Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant have been reported to cause growth abnormalities and early death when fed to butterfly larvae, according to a paper published in Nature’s Scientific Reports journal. The larvae of the Pale Grass Blue butterfly (Zizeeria maha) from Okinawa, 1,000km south Fukushima which the authors describe as likely the least polluted locality in Japan, were fed fresh leaves containing radioactive caesium (137Cs and 134Cs) to examine the effects. While such studies of the effects of exposure to ionising radiation are important to improve our scientific understanding of the risks involved, it’s unfortunate that the authors of the study chose to delay publishing their estimates of the dose rates their butterflies had received. Because we’re quite sure that if they had done so in this paper then they’d have questioned their own conclusions. Using openly available software such as Erica, the authors could have estimated a dose rate (radiological dose, measured in Gray per hour) for their stated LD50 (the lethal dose required to kill 50% of exposed individuals). We estimate this to be around 8 μGy per hour (micro-Gray, one millionth of a Gray), assuming a worst case in which the larvae retained all the caesium they ingested over the period of around 12 days.  This is likely to be a considerable overestimate of the dose they actually received, given the levels of radioactivity detected in those larvae that had died, which were around three orders of magnitude lower than the estimate we’ve used. The dose rate from natural background radiation is typically in the micro-Gray per hour range. Consequently, the LD50 dose the authors report is close to the levels of radiation that organisms are normally exposed to from natural sources. The implication of this is that organisms would be at risk everywhere – yet this is a situation that is clearly not the case. While there are few studies on butterflies, the existing scientific literature on invertebrates suggests that the LD50 for subadult live-stages is at least 1 Gray (requiring, over 12 days, more than 400 times the dose rate we estimate for the authors LD50). Consequently, the authors’ claim that their results suggest “that the Pale Grass Blue butterfly is generally resistant to internal radiation exposure. The possible biological impacts of much lower radiation levels will be the subject of future investigations” demonstrates a worrying lack of awareness of current scientific knowledge. Unfortunately a more detailed analysis is difficult due to the lack of information provided in the paper. While all of the treated larvae (except the control) showed similar mortality and abnormality rates, the authors also acknowledge an error in the number of individuals in the control group, which leaves the reader at a loss as to whether this has any impact on the results. There are also some technical errors in the paper. For instance they record dose in Becquerel (Bq), which is a measure of the rate of radioactive decays per second. Yet radioactive dose is properly measured in Gray (Gy), equivalent to a joule of radiated energy absorbed by a kilogramme of mass. The authors state their observations support the linear no-threshold (LNT) model, yet the LNT model does not relate to deterministic (as reported in this paper) effects.  We welcome papers investigating the impact of ionising radiation on wildlife, but these basic errors show we must ensure that the peer review of such papers involves scientists from an appropriate range of disciplines. It’s been noted that many papers purporting to show significant radiological impacts on wildlife are appearing in journals not usually focused on or specialising in radiation protection."
"Chinese wildlife faces a serious survival crisis, but the tide seems to be turning in support for protecting endangered species there. China’s top legislative body has passed a new “interpretation” of their criminal law that will allow authorities to jail people who knowingly eat products made from rare wild animals. They could potentially face sentences of more than ten years. Chinese consumption of wildlife has long been the target of external criticism. An explosion in wealth has created a swelling middle class with a voracious appetite for valuables, collectibles, luxury goods and exotic foods. Eating endangered species has become a status symbol, with government officials some of the main culprits. Now, support is growing within China against the way wildlife is treated and consumed. Chinese people have a reputation for eating anything with four legs that’s not a table. But the culinary sub-culture of eating all manner of creatures that was traditionally limited to South China and practised at times of extreme food scarcity, became a national passion with the country’s economic boom. Traditional Chinese medicine has been used to justify a host of practices that exploit endangered animals in the wild and in captivity. Although China removed rhino horns and tiger parts from the active list of traditional ingredients in 1993, the belief in their “unparalleled healing power” remains alive among practitioners and members of the Chinese scientific community. Experiments in rhino farming and the controversial tiger farming can only sustain the belief in the unique medicinal effects of rhino horns and tiger bones. Braised tiger meat, stewed monkey legs and bear paws, shredded pangolin, snake and turtle soup, and barbecued crocodile meat are sending traders to places as far as Russian Siberia, disputed waters of the South China Sea, North America, and the African Continent. Not only does Chinese wildlife face a serious survival crisis as a result, this appetite for endangered animals is a threat to wildlife everywhere. China’s wildlife policy is contradictory. It adopted the Wildlife Protection Law in 1988. To critics, the law is more resource management legislation than a wildlife protection act as wildlife is designated as a natural resource. This places the focus on how it can best serve human consumption. In the context of the national obsession with economic growth, wildlife has become an abused resource. At a local level, catering businesses that serve exotic foods and farming operations that brutalise captive wildlife animals are protected by local officials. The owner of a major bear farm in Northeast China was showered with all kinds of honours. He was made a deputy to the provincial people’s congress, the highest honour a business person can receive from the government. The result is that more species have become endangered since the Wildlife Protection Law’s adoption and businesses exploiting endangered animals have thrived, seemingly with the law’s endorsement. Plus, trade across provinces has developed and now forms part of an international operation. But China is changing and the new interpretation of China’s criminal law is a political step that reflects changing attitudes to the treatment of animals. To China’s increasingly vocal animal activists and members of its “one-child” generation, the exploitation of wildlife for human benefits is not only selfish and short-sighted, but also self-destructive. Bear farming is one example where public opinion has experienced a sea change. In the early 1990s, bear farming was praised by the government, in the media, and in all other official propaganda programs as a production that saves wild bears, glorifies Chinese culture, serves the interest of public health, and contributes to poverty reduction and economic growth. Today, bear farming is condemned by the media and the public in general, largely as a result of efforts by the Animals Asia Foundation’s China Bear Rescue campaign. The latest policy can also be seen as an important legal measure to support President Xi Jinping’s crackdown against extravagant consumption by government officials. Since the adoption of his austerity policy, shark fin consumption in the last Chinese New Year dropped significantly. Soon after the policy’s release, a provincial legislator was dismissed for possessing 33 ivory tusks and is under criminal investigation. A wider animal protection movement is also gathering momentum and challenging patterns of eating that are promoted by business interests. It was response to public pressure that made the government halt the introduction of American rodeos and Spanish bull-fighting to the domestic Chinese audience. It was also public pressure that brought about the elimination of shark fin from official catering events. Development in China is increasingly seen not just in economic terms, but in an appreciation for quality of life and a desire for the government to take a moral lead. Wildlife protection is a crucial component of this. As a rising superpower, the Chinese government’s actions for wildlife protection will not only enhance its legitimacy domestically, but internationally too."

Greens veteran Bob Brown has suddenly discovered that he isn’t that keen on wind farms after all. After years of sneering at we the Luddites, who objected to the ugly, “bat-chomping bird-slicing eco-crucifixes”, the announcement of plans to build a colossal wind farm in Tasmania has had a galvanising effect on the former Greens leader.



Former Greens leader and veteran activist Bob Brown is campaigning to stop a $1.6 billion wind farm development in Tasmania because it will spoil the view and kill birds.



The sheer scale of this proposed development beggars belief.



The proposed Robbins Island wind farm in Tasmania’s northwest will be one of the world’s biggest, with up to 200 towers measuring 270m high from ground to blade tip.



If it goes ahead, electricity from the Robbins Island project will be sent to the mainland via a new ­undersea cable to help make Tasmania a “battery for the nation”.



These turbines will be taller than the New Plymouth power station chimney, and 80% of the height of the Auckland Sky Tower. **All 200 of them.**



No wonder Bob Brown’s had a change of heart.



Despite the criticisms levelled at former prime minister Tony Abbott and treasurer Joe Hockey for describing wind turbines as “ugly”, Dr Brown said the Robbins Island plan was, visually, a step too far. “Mariners will see this hairbrush of tall towers from 50km out to sea and elevated landlubbers will see it, like it or not, from greater distances on land,” Dr Brown said. “Its eye-catchiness will divert from every coastal scene on the western Bass Strait coastline.”



The greatest hypocrisy of the Green movement regarding wind turbines has been their shameful silence about the toll wreaked on wildlife. The same activists who have been trying to stop a coal mine because of a single finch, have said nothing as dozens of threatened species are minced into oblivion by wind turbines.



In his letter on the wind farm, Dr Brown wrote: “Besides the impact on the coastal scenery, wind turbines kill birds. Wedge-tailed eagle and white-bellied sea eagles nest and hunt on the island. Swift parrots and orange-bellied parrots traverse the island on their migrations.”



He listed the multiple species of international migratory, endangered and critically endangered shorebirds that used the wetlands for six months of the year. They included Australian fairy tern, fork-tailed swift, little tern, white-throated needletail, ruddy turnstone, sharp-tailed sandpiper, sanderling, red knot, curlew sandpiper, red-necked stint, great knot, double-banded plover, greater sand plover, lesser sand plover, Latham’s snipe, bar-tailed godwit, eastern curlew, whimbrel, golden plover, grey plover, grey-tailed tattler, common greenshank, terek sandpiper, hooded plover.



  
As Brown belatedly discovers his conscience regarding the whirling engines of bird and bat death, his Green mates are ducking for cover.



The response from the Greens party and environment groups to Dr Brown’s outburst was as quiet as a wind rotor on a dead-calm day.



The Greens and Australian Conservation Foundation refused to criticise either Dr Brown or the project, slated to be one of the ­biggest wind farms in the world if it goes ahead.



In the past, federal Greens leader Richard Di Natale has likened investigating complaints about wind farms and noise to taking ­seriously alien abductions.



He refused to support the appointment of a wind farm commissioner to handle public com­plaints. His staff yesterday said he did not wish to comment on his former leader’s protest.



  
Bob Brown is undoubtedly a hypocrite. But for once, though, he’s also right. The proposed wind farm in north-west Tasmania is mind-boggling. The climate-conscious voters of inner-Sydney wouldn’t for an instant countenance such a monster on the windy cliffs of Bondi. Out of their sight, out of mind here in Tasmania just isn’t good enough.

Solar cemetery? The solar boom dies. (Photo source: US Government)
If times are tough, then one can expect to hear a bit of grumbling from those exhibiting at the trade show, but that’s about it. So when a trade show is cancelled altogether just weeks before it is scheduled to begin, then you know things must be really bad.
This is preceisely what has just happened in the solar industry. Things for the “energy of the future”, solar energy,  have gotten so bad that a major tradeshow, Intersolar China 2012, has just been cancelled. The tradeshow had been scheduled to take place from December 12 to 14 at the China Convention Center in Beijing. Now, according to www.pv-magazine.com, the event has been postponed until an unspecified date in 2013. PV magazine cites “difficult market conditions”.
With “difficult market conditions they are likely talking about the tsunami of insolvencies that has swept over the global solar business. A slew of large solar companies likely have cancelled their participation and so many of the exhibition stands would be empty. This is a major embarrassment for proponents of solar energy.
Other German media outlets are now reporting on the Interworld China debacle. Read here, here and here.

PV magazine writes:
Intersolar China opened its doors for the first time just last December in Beijing. Solar Promotion International’s first Chinese tradeshow got off to a slow start, with just 135 of an expected 250 exhibitors showing up. Top-tier solar panel manufacturers like Yingli, Suntech and JA Solar also stood out by not being present at the show.”
Even Siemens Corporation unloads its solar business
Earlier this week, engineering giant Siemens Corporation announced it’s bailing out of the solar biz as well. CO2 Handel writes:
Intersolar first began 20 years ago in Freiburg [Germany] and saw steady growth. […] Over the past several months a number of German manufacturers, among them former market leader Q-Cells, have declared insolvency. On Monday Siemens Corporation announced it would sell its solar business because it had failed to fulfil expectations.”
How many billions in stimulus packages were pumped in to prop up this industry? Now the bubble has popped and consumers are left with higher electric rates and a solar rust belt. In the meantime former solar executives are likely retired and living high on the hog, relaxing on diesel-fuel powered yachts – paid for by “stimulus” dollars.
This has got to be one of the biggest scams of all time.

"Pope Francis has admitted to moments of selfishness while living in lockdown at the Vatican, and has saluted people on the frontline of the fight against the coronavirus, including doctors and shop workers, as “the saints who live next door”. With characteristic frankness, the pope said he struggled with “self-preoccupation” in a largely solitary existence. “Of course I have my areas of selfishness. On Tuesdays, my confessor comes, and I take care of things there,” he said in an interview published in the Catholic weekly the Tablet. He added: “I’m thinking at this time of the saints who live next door. They are heroes – doctors, volunteers, religious sisters, priests, shop workers – all performing their duty so that society can continue functioning. How many doctors and nurses have died! How many religious sisters have died! All serving … If we become aware of this miracle of the next-door saints, if we can follow their tracks, the miracle will end well, for the good of all.” Responding to questions put to him by Austen Ivereigh, the British author of a papal biography, Francis spoke of the hypocrisy of politicians who talk about facing up to the coronavirus crisis sweeping the globe while failing to tackle the environmental emergency, supporting a “throwaway culture”, and continuing to manufacture weapons. “It’s true, a number of governments have taken exemplary measures to defend the population on the basis of clear priorities. But we’re realising that all our thinking, like it or not, has been shaped around the economy. “In the world of finance it has seemed normal to sacrifice [people], to practise a politics of the throwaway culture, from the beginning to the end of life … It’s a culture of euthanasia, either legal or covert, in which the elderly are given medication but only up to a point.” The coronavirus crisis put a spotlight on people’s values. “I am worried by the hypocrisy of certain political personalities who speak of facing up to the crisis, of the problem of hunger in the world, but who in the meantime manufacture weapons. This is a time to be converted from this kind of functional hypocrisy. It’s a time for integrity. Either we are coherent with our beliefs or we lose everything.” The climate crisis had been forgotten in the focus on the pandemic, he said. “Who now speaks of the fires in Australia, or remembers that 18 months ago a boat could cross the North Pole because the glaciers had all melted? Who speaks now of the floods? I don’t know if these are the revenge of nature, but they are certainly nature’s responses.” He added: “Today I believe we have to slow down our rate of production and consumption and to learn to understand and contemplate the natural world. We need to reconnect with our real surroundings … “Let us not lose our memory once all this is past, let us not file it away and go back to where we were. This is the time to take the decisive step, to move from using and misusing nature to contemplating it. We have lost the contemplative dimension; we have to get it back at this time.” This was the moment to focus on the poor, the homeless and those on the margins. “But the poor are hidden, because poverty is bashful. In Rome recently, in the midst of the quarantine, a policeman said to a man: ‘You can’t be on the street, go home.’ The response was: “I have no home. I live in the street.’ To discover such a large number of people who are on the margins … They are there but we don’t see them: they have become part of the landscape; they are things.” In Europe, he said, “when we are beginning to hear populist speeches and witness political decisions of [a] selective kind, it’s all too easy to remember Hitler’s speeches in 1933, which were not so different from some of the speeches of a few European politicians now”. Pope Francis described life under lockdown in the Santa Marta residence, where he lives. “We now have two shifts for meals, which helps a lot to alleviate the impact. Everyone works in his office or from his room, using technology. Everyone is working; there are no idlers here. “How am I living this spiritually? I’m praying more, because I feel I should. And I think of people. That’s what concerns me: people. Thinking of people anoints me, it does me good, it takes me out of my self-preoccupation. Of course I have my areas of selfishness. On Tuesdays, my confessor comes, and I take care of things there. “I’m living this as a time of great uncertainty. It’s a time for inventing, for creativity.” People could “either get depressed and alienated … or we can get creative”. But it was not easy to be confined to the home, he said. “The counsel is not to give up, but save yourself for better times, for in those times remembering what has happened will help us. Take care of yourselves for a future that will come. And remembering in that future what has happened will do you good.” Asked if he had a message for the elderly who were self-isolating and for confined young people, he said: “The elderly continue to be our roots. And they must speak to the young. This tension between young and old must always be resolved in the encounter with each other. Because the young person is bud and foliage, but without roots they cannot bear fruit. The elderly are the roots.”"

Sunset Clause for the C-Tax? 
Letter to the Editor
Watts Up With That?
30 July 2011
Australians must insist that the monstrous carbon dioxide tax legislation has a sunset clause which is triggered by global cooling.
This whole tax extravaganza is based on the foolish notion that man’s production of life-sustaining carbon dioxide controls global temperature and we need a C-Tax to stop it.

However no one has produced evidence that carbon dioxide exclusively controls the climate. What’s more, carbon dioxide production is rising strongly but world temperature has been stable for the last 13 years. Right now sea surface temperatures are falling sharply.
“Climate” is generally defined as an average of 30 years of weather. Therefore the C-Tax should be scrapped immediately the global temperature falls below the 30 year average temperature, indicating the start of global cooling.
As the sun has gone quiet, and Queensland has just had its coldest autumn for at least 60 years, this looks likely to happen soon.

There is very worrying news about; there is an emergency! Obviously the place to get information about emergencies is the wonderful world wide webby thingy so what does a search for ’emergency in NZ’ give?



 **Is it an emergency?**  
You can call 111 emergency call in situations such as:



If you are not sure if it is an emergency but you are still worried, call 111 and ask the operator. They will help you decide what to do.



  
Our wonderful, fantastic, emergency service personnel are ready, waiting and willing to assist; be they fire, ambulance, police, search and rescue or civil defence staff.



However, none of the above services seemed to have the capabilities or tools, vehicles, training etc to rush to our aid in the current emergency.



This was very disappointing and a little distressing. Who ya gonna call?



There is, apparently, a climate emergency so send in the …?



What a despicable slap in the face for the real everyday heroes of our ‘proper’ emergency services, depreciating the word “emergency” for cheap political virtue signalling.



Some wit somewhere said it was like calling 111 and booking an ambulance to call in 20 years’ time.



One wag suggested we could instead ring the new non-emergency number ten five but if you listen to the song the so-called Climate emergency doesn’t even meet the requirements for that. It only goes to prove how silly this climate emergency malarkey really is.

An article on Stuff asks the question, **“Do you need to be popular to win an election?”** What then follows is political commentary trying to make a case for why National should hold on to an unpopular leader. I cannot help but surmise that they want National to keep him in order to assure Labour’s victory next election.



Their alternative facts in support of their case for keeping Mr Unpopular are sketchy.



Simon Bridges is polling in the low single digits in the preferred Prime Minister stakes. […] **But that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s curtains for the MP for Tauranga.** Depending on which poll you believe, National’s preferred party numbers are still right up there – around 44 per cent, more than Labour. 



**Espiner says National could win with a leader who’s polling so low** – and the numbers don’t matter that much. The famous example is Jim Bolger – never that popular, but he won three elections, in spite of being out-polled at times by Winston Peters, then a junior minister.  
  
[…] The exception is when the tide is going out on a government and there’s a popular opposition leader – John Key for example, and then Jacinda Ardern.  
“It’s an ugly number for Simon Bridges to be between four and five per cent, but **it’s not fatal for him** ,” he says.



Using Bolger as evidence is a dopey example as he only ever faced one election under MMP, which he very nearly lost. Here are the facts that matter:



The popularity of the leader is very important and no matter how the RNZ political editor spins it Simon Bridges is not going to lead the National party to victory against a leader so much more popular than him.



RNZ’s political editor Jane Patterson says Bridges was elected amongst an acknowledgement really from his caucus that times are changing, and there are big issues including the likes of climate change and inequality in the housing market that a younger face would better represent.  
“He did come with a history of being a very senior cabinet minister in the English and Key administrations, so he had that credibility of having been in the executive and seeing how things were run,” she says.  
  
Bridges is no Ardern – but does he need to be?  
Patterson says that’s an issue strategists are bending their heads around.  
  
[…] Those strategists are starting to say people aren’t warming to Bridges, even though he’s very hard working.  
“It comes back to that matter of personality and credibility, and when people look at him it’s always about, ‘can we see a future Prime Minister?'”  
She says the public can, however, change their mind about someone – look at Helen Clark’s makeover.  
**“A lot of that comes too with the mana of the job,”** she says.  
“Once people see you as Prime Minister they see you glad-handling, they see you making big announcements, they see you steering the ship. Often that will shift people’s views and say ‘actually, they’re doing a pretty good job’.”



  
Yeah, there is one slight problem with that point. He has to win the election in order to gain the “Mana” of being the prime minister and with his low popularity, he is highly unlikely to ever achieve that.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA new working paper titled Climate Skeptics In Germany And Their War Against The Energy Revolution by the Department of Political Science, Faculty of Social Sciences, University of Vienna, written by Dr. Achim Brunnengräber of the University of Berlin Department of Political Science, has just been released.
What’s a bit surprising is that the Catholic Theological Private Institute of Linz contributed to this hate-tinged, highly confrontational, intolerant working paper, which is designed to further demonize those with a different opinion. Obviously elements of Catholicism have regressed back to the good old Galileo days when doctrine was not to be challenged. You could view it as a Redeclaration of War on Skeptics.
Moreover, what is especially frightening is that Brunnengräber appears to be totally unaware of the massive body of recent scientific research and data refuting the IPCC climate science.
Indeed, a stunning blow was delivered to the author, and the overall renewable energy movement, just days ago when Angela Merkel’s Environment Minister Peter Altmaier announced that the German transition to renewable energy would end up costing citizens a spectacular 1 trillion euros by the end of the 2030s, de facto confirming the project is a colossal flop that threatens the existence of the nation. He is now working to put the brakes on.
The paper’s introduction (p. 7) states that the public is getting increasingly unsettled about the burdens coming from Germany’s energy revolution, and writes that “people who deny man-made climate change, play down its impacts, or fundamentally question climate policy appear to be gaining ground in this atmosphere. In Germany, their voices are becoming increasingly louder and are getting greater attention from politics, media, and the broad public.”
Paper’s “surprising results”:
The introduction presents the paper’s three main results:
1. There are more and more signs that the climate skeptics in Germany are gaining political ground and attention.
2. The denial of climate change is, however, no longer the central issue. The skeptics are focussing their criticism increasingly on the political consequences that resulted from climate change.
3. This leads to questioning the transition to renewable energy. Thus the positions of the climate skeptics are gaining acceptance and are finding support – also from prominent figures.
The report then asks if a similarly strong debate like the one that has long been found in the USA could appear in Germany. Brunnengräber advises that the skeptics should not be taken lightly, and suggests the possibility of that happening is real, and that there are “substantial reasons against ignoring them“.
Brunnengräber begins by defining and fingering out the skeptic forces, putting focus on The Heartland Institute, CFACT and Fred Singer in USA; and the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE), Fritz Vahrenholt, journalists Dirk Maxeiner, Ulli Kulke and Günter Ederer in Germany, and claiming that climate skepticism is based on the findings of “dubious” scientists, all designed to spread doubt and uncertainty among the public. The report drags out the old, worn-out claims that skeptics are being massively funded by “the oil industry, its think tanks, and massive financial resources“.
Brunnengräber accuses the skeptics of defamation. In section 7.5 on page 44, he describes the skeptic network in Germany as:
…”a colorful heap of blogging amateur climatologists (most being retired professors), a handful of lobbyists, politicians and hobby scientists. Singer here plays an important role at the EIKE events in Germany, and is always a welcome guest. Among the speakers are Christopher Monckton, a conservative politician from Great Britain and Chris Horner of the Competitive Enterprise Institute.”
Through the conferences…
…with the international guests – the network of climate skeptics in Germany is spreading more and more. Moreover, there is contact with the Global Warming Policy Foundation.”

Skepticism in Germany “increasingly a problem”.
The report writes at the end of section 7.5:
Climate skeptics are being viewed by many German politicians and scientists increasingly as a problem (Hornschuh 2008: 149). Yet, there is little or no direct contact between climate deniers and their opponents. The conflicts are playing out via the media. The one exception confirms the rule: In May 2011, there was a meeting between EIKE members and representatives of the Potsdam Institute (PIK), but whose content was not released to the media. An open discussion appears to be impossible because the “absolute skepticism of the climate skeptics immunizes against counter-arguments.”
Here, Brunnengräber forgets to mention that it was the PIK who requested that the meeting’s content not be released, and that it is the PIK’s scientists who refuse to debate in public.
In the paper’s summary, Brunnengräber concludes (concedes) that the skeptic movement in Germany is now “well-embedded institutionally” with groups like EIKE, the Manhattan Institute, TvR media Publishing, the blog Achse des Guten, and some professors at various universities. One expert team suggests that “the strength and success of the skeptics does not come from prominent, renowned scientists or experts, but from a network of climate skeptics that connects protagonists from science, media, private industry, and politics“.
Brunnengräber also points out that presence of skeptical positions in the media has increased since the 2009 Copenhagen conference. Stefan Rahmstorf once ostracized (p. 43) the German mainstream media, e.g. Spiegel, FAZ, Die Welt, RTL, etc., for giving the skeptics attention, accusing them of “unfiltered presentation, poor quality control, and referring to skeptics as “experts”.
Brunnengräber’s paper claims to welcome scientific debate (so long you don’t disagree) p 11:
Here a healthy measure of skepticism is essential for every scientific step forward and for the process of gathering knowledge. Doubt belongs to human thinking […] without which science is unimaginable. However, criticism must be factual, sound and based on science. But here this appears not to be always the case. The German science skeptical debate on climate change is not only an unhealthy skepticism, but it is characterized by an absolute negation and rejection of all data showing an anthropogenic, i.e. man-made climate change.”
The source of that quote used here by Brunnengräber is radical environmental group Germanwatch.
Merkel fears a planet with 9 billion people…
Even Angela Merkel shows hints of being unconvinced by the climate science, and supports the transition to green energy moreso because of an irrational fear she has of a planet inhabited by 9 billion humans all wanting to be prosperous, which she recently revealed at a WBGU meeting. Page 10 of the report quotes Merkel:
I always lump climate change and resource efficiency together as one issue because I have no desire to argue with doubters on whether or not climate change is so bad or if it will be that bad. Just the fact that we are approaching 9 billion people on the planet shows that those among us who don’t believe in climate change have to change their thinking.”
Stunning. Based on that, for Merkel, the discussion is over.
Her big worry seems to be the 9 billion people we will soon have on the planet, and making sure there is enough Lebensraum…a seemingly incurable, neurotic obsession among many Germans in power.
Finally on the author, Brunnengräber, one Dutch expert wrote in an e-mail to me: “These Austrian authors (political scientists and sociologists, I
presume) have still not understood that climate scepticism is based on evidence and science.”
It’s what one calls: expertise based on ignorance.

_The Current Wisdom_ is a series of monthly articles in which Senior Fellow Patrick J. Michaels reviews interesting items on global warming in the scientific literature that may not have received the media attention that they deserved, or have been misinterpreted in the popular press.



 _The Current Wisdom_ only comments on science appearing in the refereed, peer‐​reviewed literature, or that has been peer‐​screened prior to presentation at a scientific congress.



Prior to April, 2011, issues of this Wisdom, which began in 2010, are available at our blog Cato@Liberty (www​.cato​-at​-lib​er​ty​.org/).





Three weeks ago, the National Academies of Sciences’ National Research Council (NRC) released a report _Sea‐​Level Rise for the Coasts of California, Oregon, and Washington: Past, Present, and Future_. You can find it at: (http://​www8​.nation​ala​cad​e​mies​.org/​o​n​p​i​n​e​w​s​/​n​e​w​s​i​t​e​m​.​a​s​p​x​?​R​e​c​o​r​d​I​D​=​13389).



The apparent intent of the report was to raise global warming alarm by projecting rapidly rising seas (some two to three times higher than estimates from the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)) — along the California coast and elsewhere.



Unfortunately, to produce such a large and rapid sea level rise, the NRC had to throw overboard a lot of good science and do a lot of cherry‐​picking of the rest.



Of course global sea level will continue to rise, with or without human‐​induced climate change, as readers will see below. The NRC projects a wildly high upper bound of some 4–5 feet this century, while, in reality, the rate of future rise will likely be closer to the rise observed during the 20th century, about 8–12 inches. Coastal residents adapted to this with little or no overt effort.



How the NRC came up with a global sea level rise by the year 2100 of some 50 to 140 cm (20 to 55 inches) — is an example of using only a careful selection of available data and turning a deaf ear to warnings (made by the scientists themselves) of its unreliability for long‐​term projections.



How did the NRC come up with such an enormous rise in sea level?



They independently projected the sea level rise from its two major components — ocean thermal expansion (from increasing ocean temperatures) and water input from the melting of ice — and then added them together.



But for each component, their high end projections are very likely much too high. And in combination, they represent something that is virtually impossible.



Consider thermal expansion. The NRC simply used the 21st century temperature change projections from the IPCC’s 2007 collection of climate models. Is there a problem here?



Since they started in 2001, the IPCC model projections have warmed at a rate over twice what is being observed in reality. So, if the current global temperature behavior under rapidly rising greenhouse gas concentrations is any indication of the future behavior under rapidly rising greenhouse gas concentrations, then the future projections of the sea level rise due to the thermal expansion of ocean water are grossly overestimated. The NRC did not even consider such a possibility, instead preferring to base their projections on the assumption that the future climate behavior will depart radically from the current climate behavior, i.e. throwing out observations in favor of what appear to be failing climate models. This model‐​based method produces a lot more sea level rise than extrapolating observations would produce.



Which brings us to the NRC projections for the other element of sea level rise — melting of land‐​based ice, primarily from Greenland and Antarctica. For this projection, the NRC turned their previous methodology on its head, and opted to extrapolate current trends (to the absurd) rather than rely on ice models. In this case, the models yield much less sea level rise than the NRC extrapolation of current trends.



This is how the NRC describes its method:



The base‐​rate extrapolation assumes that present‐​day observed trends in loss rates continue in the future.



And to get even _more_ sea level rise than current trends allow, the NRC additionally does this:



Increased ice discharge beyond presently observed rates was simulated by extrapolating a multiple of present‐​day observed discharge forward in time to 2100.



For example, here is how they handled ice loss from Greenland



For Greenland, the average speed of all outlet glaciers was increased by 2 km yr‐​1, equivalent to a net discharge of 375.1 GT yr‐​1. These values are consistent with the observed doubling of Greenland’s mass balance deficit between ca. 1996 and 2000.



For what it’s worth, the current ice discharge rate from Greenland, as determined from an improved satellite algorithm (Wu et al., 2010) is 104 GT/​yr — less than a third of the NRC’s high end case.



The result is that the NRC projects that by 2100, Greenland will have contributed between 14.8 cm and 33.8 cm (5.8 in. to 13.3 in.) to global sea level rise, with their best projection of 20.1 ± 2.7 cm (7.9 ± 1.1in.).



Is this at all realistic? In a word, no.



There has been a whole lot of research published in recent years (and covered by _The Current Wisdom_ ) on ice loss from Greenland’s glaciers. In virtually all cases, previously hypothesized mechanisms for a prolonged rapid speed‐​up of Greenland’s glaciers have been debunked.



And as to the reliability of extrapolating future trends into the future, here are a few relevant quotes:



From Van der Wahl et al., _Science_ , 2008:



“Longer observational records with high temporal resolution in other ablation areas of the [Greenland] ice sheet are necessary to test the importance of the positive‐​feedback mechanism between melt rates and ice velocities. At present, we cannot conclude that this feedback is important.”



From Nick et al., _Nature Geosciences_ , 2009:



“Our results imply that the recent rates of mass loss in Greenland’s outlet glaciers are transient and should not be extrapolated into the future.”



And most recently, from Moon et al., _Science_ , 2012:



“Finally, our observations have implications for recent work on sea level rise. Earlier research used a kinematic approach to estimate upper bounds of 0.8 to 2.0 m for 21st‐​century sea level rise. In Greenland, this work assumed ice-sheet–wide doubling of glacier speeds (low‐​end scenario) or an order of magnitude increase in speeds (high‐​end scenario) from 2000 to 2010. Our wide sampling of actual 2000 to 2010 changes shows that glacier acceleration across the ice sheet remains far below these estimates, suggesting that sea level rise associated with Greenland glacier dynamics remains well below the low‐​end scenario (9.3 cm by 2100) at present. Continued acceleration, however, may cause sea level rise to approach the low‐​end limit by this century’s end.”



So, even though the authors of papers reporting on the recent glacier flow rates in Greenland say that current rates should not be extrapolated into the future and that even the current glacial acceleration of flow rate produces only very minimal contributions of sea level rise from Greenland, the NRC authors decide not only to go ahead and extrapolate current rates into the future, but then, for good measure, to increase the flow even more on top of that. This assures an extreme value of sea level rise from the contribution of melting ice.



Combine a too large estimate from ocean thermal expansion with a too large estimate from ice melt, and you get an alarming amount of sea level rise. Crank it up even higher with more unrealistic assumptions about ice behavior in the future and you get a high end sea level rise projection (55 inches) that is some two times larger than the highest IPCC estimate. This kind of alarmism may get you on MSNBC, but that doesn’t mean it’s right.



And there is much more to find fault with in the NRC sea level rise report.



Another topic that we have covered in _The Current Wisdom_ on several occasions has been the recent research examining the contribution to sea level rise from non‐​climate related human activities. These activities can both act to lower sea level (by impounding water behind dams) and to raise it (by extracting water from aquifers that eventually finds a way into the oceans). Several researchers have been working to compile a temporal history of these effects on a global scale across much of the past 100 years. What they have found is that early‐​on, a lot of dams were being built, and more water was being impounded than was being pumped out of aquifers. The net result was a negative contribution to sea level rise. But in recent years, the rate of dam building has declined and the rate of groundwater extraction increased to the point where, starting in about the early 1980s, the net effect is a positive contribution to sea level rise. Over past decade or so, that contribution has been responsible for some 15–25% of the observed sea level rise.



But the NRC largely sets aside this topic, asserting:



The contributions of groundwater withdrawal and reservoir storage to sea‐​level change remain poorly constrained, largely due to sparse data and inadequate models. Each process likely has a significant but opposite effect on sea‐​level change, on the order of 0.5 mm per year.



In our last _Current Wisdom_ article, we showed that the acceleration in the rate of sea level rise apparent during the past 50 years or so in the historical sea level record from tide gauges is completely explained by the history of anthropogenic alterations to the flow of water into the oceans (i.e., impoundment and dewatering).



This has an impact on the apportionment of observed sea level rise into its various components, which of course has an impact on our understanding of the various influences and controls.



For instance, the NRC determines that the current rate of contribution to sea level rise from ice loss from Greenland is 0.56 ± 0.13 mm/​yr (0.02 inches/​year) and from Antarctica is 0.37 ± 0.14mm/yr (0.01 inch/​year). The NRC arrives at these numbers by using a weighted average of several recently published estimates made by various methodologies and from various research groups. But one of the estimates is much lower than the others — the one from Wu et al. (2010). Long‐​time _Wisdom_ fans may recognize this citation as we discussed it in the very first _Wisdom_ that we wrote back in the fall of 2010 (https://​www​.cato​.org/​t​h​e​-​c​u​r​r​e​n​t​-​w​i​sdom/).



Wu et al. (2010) determined that all the other estimates of ice loss from Greenland and Antarctica that were being derived from the satellite measured gravity fields (using the GRACE satellite) were in error as they were arrived at by using an improperly calibrated glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) model — that is, a model of how the land surface has been slowly responding since the removal of the large ice burden of the Last Ice Age. When Wu et al. (2010) supplied a better model, the ice loss estimated dropped considerably. Wu et al. calculated that ice loss from Greenland was occurring at a rate of 0.29 ± 0.06 mm/​yr and 0.23 ± 0.12mm/yr from Antarctica. According to Wu et al. (2010):



“We conclude that a significant revision of the present estimates of glacial isostatic adjustments and land–ocean water exchange is required.”



But the NRC buries this result in a multi‐​estimate average. This certainly produces the wrong answer. Either the other studies, using the old GIA model are correct and Wu et al. is wrong, or else, as concluded by Wu et al., the other studies are wrong and the Wu et al. numbers are closer to being correct. And if Wu et al. are correct, then the NRC is wrong.



Is there good evidence that the ice loss rates calculated by Wu et al. (2010) are correct?



In the past two years, the central estimate of the average amount of water contributed to the global oceans from non‐​climate activities is about 0.4 mm/​yr (from Wada et al., 2012), and the amount contributed from ice loss from Greenland and Antarctica is 0.52mm/yr (from Wu et al., 2010). Together, this sums to 0.92 mm/​yr. But according to the NRC, the net human non‐​climate contribution is near zero, and the net Greenland and Antarctic contribution is 0.93 mm/​yr. So the sea level budget continues to close, no matter which of these sets of results is used. But if the Wada/​Wu set is correct, then it means that ice loss is contributing just a tad but more than half of what the NRC cooked up, which must mean that ice loss from Greenland and Antarctic is much less sensitive to rising temperatures than determined by the NRC.



At the very, very least, the NRC should have at least separately included the Wada/​Wu possibility, rather than largely tossing it out.



Doomsaying from the NRC is unfortunately the expected result when science careers are enhanced by the presence massive amounts of taxpayer funds, which tend to get doled out to those who cry “wolf” the loudest. This phenomenon, which ultimately results in very bad public policy, is something we are now studying intently here at Cato.

Over the past 50 years, homeschooling has grown from a fringe act to a widely accepted education model reflective of a diverse American population. Many parents choose homeschooling to avoid the constraints of the conventional classroom and to embrace education in a broader, often more pluralistic way. Increasingly, homeschooling is driving education innovation, as entrepreneurial parents and educators create hybrid learning models that redefine and expand the homeschooling paradigm.



According to the National Center for Education Statistics, the U.S. homeschooling population more than doubled between 1999 and 2012, from 850,000 to 1.8 million children, or 3.4 percent of the K–12 student population.1 Federal data show that the homeschooling population dipped slightly between 2012 and 2016, but state‐​level data reveal that some states with robust education choice programs saw rising numbers of homeschoolers during that time. Fluctuation in the homeschooling population is likely due to many factors, including regulatory changes that could make homeschooling either easier or more difficult for parents, but some homeschooling families may be taking advantage of school choice mechanisms, like education savings accounts (ESAs) and tax‐​credit scholarships. Even if they are not, an environment that supports educational freedom may encourage homeschooling growth.



This paper offers an overview of homeschooling trends and a glimpse at the current homeschooling population while arguing that educational freedom creates momentum for families to seek alternatives to conventional mass schooling. By expanding the definition of education and placing families in charge, education choice programs can empower parents, provide varied learning opportunities for young people, and stimulate education innovation and entrepreneurship. Despite legitimate fears of regulation, homeschoolers should generally support school choice proposals.



Compulsory‐​schooling laws spread throughout the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and their grip became more far‐​reaching. As mandatory schooling extended earlier into childhood and later into adolescence for more of a child’s day and year, the once widespread and accepted practice of homeschooling virtually disappeared. It reemerged in the early 1970s, when countercultural left “hippies” kept their children out of school and educated them at home or on back‐​to‐​the‐​land communes. While progressives may have launched the modern homeschooling movement, Christian conservatives expanded it. Seemingly disparate in their motivations, both groups rejected state‐​controlled, institutional schooling and sought a more personalized, child‐​centered approach to education. As education historian Milton Gaither wrote:



The progressive left had long harbored romantic ideals of child nature, born of Rousseau and come of age in the progressive education movement of the early twentieth century. Countercultural leftists inherited this outlook, and when they had children their instinct was to liberate the kids from what they took to be the deadening effects of institutionalization by keeping them at home. And the countercultural right, despite ostensibly conservative and biblical theological commitments, had basically the same view.2



During the 1980s and 1990s, the number of homeschoolers swelled, reaching 850,000 by 1999, the first year the Department of Education began tracking homeschooling data as part of its National Household Education Surveys Program. Today, while religious homeschoolers remain a significant demographic, fewer families are choosing homeschooling for overtly religious reasons. By 2012, “concern about the environment of other schools” exceeded religious motivations as the primary catalyst for homeschooling.3



Over the past decade, homeschooling families have become much more reflective of the general U.S. population. The long‐​held stereotype of homeschooling families as white, middle‐​class, and Christian is changing. Homeschooling has become a mainstream option for many families who are fed up with increasingly standardized mass schooling. According to the _New York Times_ , “Once mainly concentrated among religious families as well as parents who wanted to release their children from the strictures of traditional classrooms, home schooling is now attracting parents who want to escape the testing and curriculums that have come along with the Common Core, new academic standards that have been adopted by more than 40 states.”4 _Business Insider_ went so far as to say that “homeschooling could be the smartest way to teach kids in the 21st century.”5



Homeschoolers have become more urban (Figure 1), secular, and socioeconomically diverse, and more single parents and dual‐​working parents have taken to homeschooling. But perhaps the most significant recent shift in the homeschooling population is its growing racial and ethnic diversity that is now more reflective of American society (Figure 2). Between 2007 and 2012, the percentage of black homeschoolers doubled to 8 percent of all homeschoolers, and the percentage of Hispanic homeschoolers continued to mirror the overall K–12 distribution of Hispanic children, at around one‐​quarter of all students.6



The dramatic rise in the number of black homeschoolers, in particular, may be a response to more black parents finding district school environments unsatisfactory. For instance, concerns about systemic racism, a culture of low expectations and poor academic outcomes for children of color, and a standardized curriculum that often ignores the history and culture of black people have catalyzed much of the rise in the black homeschooling movement. _The Atlantic_ reported in 2018 that for some black homeschoolers, “seizing control of their children’s schooling is an act of affirmation—a means of liberating themselves from the systemic racism embedded in so many of today’s schools and continuing the campaign for educational independence launched by their ancestors more than a century ago.”7



A more personalized, family‐​centered approach to education motivates many homeschoolers, but a key trend is using the legal designation of homeschooling to drive education innovation. Private learning centers and microschools are increasingly establishing themselves as independent organizations, not government‐​licensed schools, that support families who are legally recognized as homeschoolers. This approach can accelerate experimentation and entrepreneurship by freeing enterprising educators from restrictive schooling regulations and state licensing and allowing families more flexibility. Many of these learning centers and microschools let students attend several times a week, in some cases full time, enabling working parents, single parents, and others to register as homeschoolers and take advantage of versatile education models that stretch beyond conventional schooling.



The homeschooling population has experienced an astonishing ascent over the past 20 years, but the latest federal data suggest that the rate of increase could be slowing, with homeschooling numbers leveling off. The Department of Education has historically tracked homeschooling through its National Household Education Survey, a randomized survey tool that in 2016 captured nationwide data on 14,075 school‐​age children, of which 552 were homeschoolers. The total number of homeschoolers declined slightly from about 1.8 million students in 2012, or 3.4 percent of the overall K–12 school‐​age population, to approximately 1.7 million students in 2016, or about 3.3 percent of all students.8



Given the relatively small sampling of homeschoolers and the potential aversion some homeschooling families express toward government data collection, it is possible this federal survey tool underestimates the overall homeschooling population. But while federal surveys show the homeschooling population is holding steady or slightly declining, some state data show states are experiencing notable growth in their homeschooling populations.



Many factors could be contributing to homeschooling expansion or decline in a given state, including satisfaction with local public school options, cost and availability of private schools, parents’ job opportunities and economic prospects, demographic changes in the overall school‐​age population, changes in regulations or restrictions on homeschooling families, and availability of resources and support for homeschooling. Some research also suggests that the prevalence of public school choice programs, like charter schools, could reduce homeschooling by offering more “free” education options to parents and that vouchers might push more homeschoolers into private schools.9



Certain states with robust private education choice programs, however, are seeing particularly high growth in homeschooling compared with overall public school enrollment. Florida, for example, is a leader in private education choice programs, offering an ESA, two tax‐​credit scholarship programs, and two voucher programs. The state has experienced a significant rise in homeschooling numbers over the past several years. The Florida homeschooling population grew 6.8 percent between the 2014–2015 and 2017–2018 school years, compared with only 2.7 percent growth in the state’s K–12 public school population during that same time.10



A similar story of homeschooling growth emerges in North Carolina, where the homeschooling population is rapidly expanding. Like Florida, North Carolina has favorable education choice policies, including an ESA and two voucher programs. Between 2014 and 2018, the homeschooling population grew 27 percent to over 127,000 students, while K–12 public school enrollment fell by 1.3 percent.11



Ohio offers five separate education voucher programs. There, the homeschooling population grew by over 13 percent to over 30,000 homeschoolers between 2014 and 2018, while the overall K–12 public school population fell by just under 1 percent.12 The trend continues in Wisconsin, which offers four statewide voucher programs as well as a K–12 private school tuition tax deduction. Wisconsin public schools saw their enrollment drop by 1.3 percent between 2014 and 2018, while the homeschooling population grew by 9 percent.13



The most recent federal data on homeschooling, 2012 to 2016, show that the number of homeschoolers declined by 4.7 percent nationwide, while K–12 public school enrollment increased 1.6 percent.14 Why are states like Florida, North Carolina, Wisconsin, and Ohio defying national homeschooling trends and dramatically outpacing K–12 public school enrollment? The availability of education choice programs in these states could offer some clues.



States with successful education choice programs could be encouraging more homeschooling in a variety of ways, both practical and personal. At the practical level, some education choice programs, like ESAs, provide funds that families can use to purchase classes, supplies, curricula, and other resources, in addition to tuition. ESAs let parents opt out of public schools and public charter schools and access some public school funds through a government‐​authorized savings account. Unlike vouchers, these funds can be used for an array of education‐​related expenses, not just school tuition. ESAs help to disentangle education from schooling, acknowledging the wide variety of ways young people can and do learn.



According to a 2018 report by EdChoice, a nonprofit organization founded by Nobel prize‐​winning economist Milton Friedman and his wife, Rose, to support education choice efforts, Florida’s ESA program, known as the Gardiner Scholarship, has provided families of children with special needs access to education resources beyond schooling. Researchers Lindsey Burke and Jason Bedrick discovered that many of these ESA recipients were avoiding brick‐​and‐​mortar schooling altogether and using the ESA funds to fully customize their child’s learning. Other recipients used the money for a blend of schooling and supplemental resources, while still others used the ESA like a voucher to pay for private school tuition.15 According to Burke and Bedrick, it’s difficult to know for sure if the Florida ESA families who customized their child’s education without schooling were registered homeschoolers, but it’s quite likely that if students weren’t attending a school, they were being homeschooled. Bedrick says some of the ESA families could have been registered with the Florida Virtual School, a leader in online K–12 learning, but he explains in an interview: “I expect that most of the students in that category would be registered as being home educated.”16 ESAs could be supporting more homeschooling families in customizing their child’s education.



Education choice programs could be encouraging more families to choose homeschooling by offering funding to those who want or need it. They also could be prompting more homeschool resource centers to form, such as BigFish Learning Center, a self‐​directed learning community in Dover, New Hampshire, where some attendees take advantage of the state’s tax‐​credit scholarship program to help defray enrollment expenses. New Hampshire’s tax‐​credit scholarship program, which allows businesses or individuals to receive a tax credit when they donate to a scholarship‐​granting nonprofit organization, is currently the country’s only tax‐​credit scholarship program open to homeschoolers, who can use scholarship funds for a variety of approved education expenses if they meet income eligibility requirements.



There also may be more personal reasons why states with flourishing education choice programs have a growing homeschooling population. If everyone in your neighborhood attends an assigned district school, it can be difficult to go against the grain. In an environment of educational choice, where alternatives are available, valued, and sought after, pursuing a different education path may seem more normal. Homeschooling becomes one of many viable education choices, and the more homeschoolers there are, the more likely other families will be to explore this option. This peer effect could be large in states that enact strong choice programs. A growing homeschooling population leads to more local resources for homeschoolers, such as more classes offered by local businesses, museums, and libraries, and may spark more private learning centers and parent‐​led co‐​ops to emerge. These resources, in turn, could be encouraging more families to pursue homeschooling.



Even in states like Wisconsin and Ohio that have voucher programs for private school tuition, but not ESAs or funds specifically for homeschooling, a climate of education choice could be influencing more families to choose homeschooling. Indeed, the growth in homeschooling in Wisconsin and Ohio, where public school enrollment declined, could indicate that when there is more education choice, more parents will make more choices. Even when they don’t directly benefit from a state choice program, like a voucher, the mere presence of mechanisms that empower some parents to take control of their child’s education may prompt more parents to do so. This is an important policy point for homeschooling advocates who oppose education choice programs that would include homeschoolers out of concern that such programs could lead to greater homeschooling regulation or oversight, which is a legitimate possibility. Homeschoolers should support education choice programs, whether or not they are personally included in such programs, because more choice can lead to more homeschoolers overall.



In his influential 1955 paper popularizing the idea of vouchers, Milton Friedman explained how more education choice would break the government monopoly on schooling and lead to more diverse options and innovation. He wrote:



The result of these measures would be a sizable reduction in the direct activities of government, yet a great widening in the educational opportunities open to our children. They would bring a healthy increase in the variety of educational institutions available and in competition among them. Private initiative and enterprise would quicken the pace of progress in this area as it has in so many others. Government would serve its proper function of improving the operation of the invisible hand without substituting the dead hand of bureaucracy.17



By shifting power to families, education choice creates greater variety in how young people learn and triggers education entrepreneurship and experimentation. With its legal flexibility, homeschooling provides an ideal incubator for educational ingenuity.



In Nashville, Tennessee, for instance, two schools that focus on homeschoolers recently opened. Acton Academy Nashville is a hybrid homeschooling model in which students attend the school three days a week, and the Nashville Sudbury School offers students a full‐​time school track or a flexible homeschool track. Tuition at both schools is a fraction of the cost of other local private schools, and they share a commitment to student‐​directed, passion‐​driven learning. At Nashville Sudbury, more than half of the current students are registered homeschoolers. According to Sonia Fernandez LeBlanc, one of the founders of the Nashville Sudbury School: “Families love the flexibility that the homeschooling track allows and most take advantage of more than two days a week.” She adds: “We have a very eclectic homeschooling community in the greater Nashville area.”18



In California, Da Vinci Connect is a publicly funded, privately operated hybrid K–12 charter school network for homeschoolers where children attend the project‐​based school two days a week and spend the rest of the time at home and throughout their community. According to a recent _Forbes_ article about the Da Vinci network: “Despite what one might consider a common homeschool family unit (two parents and one who is able to not work and stay at home), many Da Vinci Connect families do not fit that mold and are finding unique ways to make the homeschool option work for them.”19



As its population becomes more diverse, and as its versatility attracts both parents and entrepreneurs, homeschooling will likely continue to drive innovation—particularly in states supportive of education choice.



In just 50 years, the modern homeschooling movement has evolved from a smattering of ideologues to a widespread educational option for many families. Today’s homeschoolers increasingly mirror the larger American population and often use the legal designation of homeschooling to create a more personalized, child‐​directed approach to learning than is possible through the dominant compulsory‐​schooling model. While recent national data suggest homeschooling growth may be slowing, state‐​level data suggest that in some states with particularly favorable education choice programs, the homeschooling population is soaring many times faster than the K–12 public school population.



Education choice through ESAs, tax‐​credit scholarships, and vouchers is beneficial and gives families options. But it may also be good for homeschoolers and others who value educational freedom and change. An environment that supports choice empowers parents to take control of their child’s education, whether or not that child is the recipient of any specific education choice funding. A climate of choice can lead more families to explore alternatives to conventional schooling and inspire entrepreneurial educators to establish new, more flexible models of learning that are better aligned with the realities of the 21st century.



In his book _Instead of Education_ , homeschooling pioneer John Holt wrote: “You cannot have human liberty, and the sense of all persons’ uniqueness, dignity, and worth on which it must rest, if you give to some people the right to tell other people what they must learn or know, or the right to say officially and ‘objectively’ that some people are more able and worthy than others.”20 The promise of education choice is that families are free to opt out of compulsory mass schooling that dictates what all young people must learn and know and that officially judges them on their worth. Fortunately, U.S. homeschoolers have been free to do this legally for over 25 years, and they may very well be the ones best positioned to extend this educational liberty to others by supporting choice for all families.

She has the magical power of being able to see a colourless, odourless, trace gas and even makes the cover of Vogue alongside our Dear Leader. However, some French political leaders are not drinking the Kool-Aid.



As James Delingpole so eloquently stated in February: _Her alarmist rhetoric was exactly the kind of half-baked, ill-informed, emotive, unscientific and utterly impractical tosh you’d expect to hear from a brainwashed 16-year old schoolgirl_.



Teen climate activist Greta Thunberg was invited to the French parliament this week but not all were worshipping at her feet.



MPs Guillaume Larrivé and Julien Aubert of the conservative Republicans called for a boycott of the Swedish activist, labelling her a “ **prophetess in shorts** ”.



“To fight climate change intelligently, **we do not need apocalyptic gurus** , but scientific progress and political courage,” Mr Larrivé said.



“We are invited to a prediction of **Saint Greta Thunberg** , surrounded by people who see global warming as a religion,” Mr Aubert told Le Figaro and added that Thunberg had no qualifications and **used only emotive arguments** , saying there was no debate to be had.



Politicians from other parties were also dismissive. 



Sébastien Chenu, a member of Marine Le Pen’s National Rally, also slammed the invite saying: “She has no legitimacy other than media, **I do not see why I would go prostrate before her.** ”



“She is a committed young woman, but **she brings nothing to the debate** , and is not enough to mask all the hypocrisy of the government. The members of the National Rally will not take part in this masquerade,” he added.



National Rally MEP Jordan Baredella, who led the party to election victory in the European Parliament elections in May, labelled Thunberg’s movement “ **a new form of totalitarianism** ”.



“This **dictatorship of permanent emotion, moreover when it is based on children** , is a new form of totalitarianism. It is beyond ridiculous,” he said.



Did you ever read a better description of Ardern’s leadership? **“A dictatorship of permanent emotion, based on children.”**



And while not based upon children the dictatorship of pure emotion was the driving reason for the ill-considered rush to control firearms.

"Cigarette packets with grisly warnings of the consequences of smoking are intended to deter smokers. Now a group of public health experts says similar warnings should appear on high-carbon products, from airline tickets and energy bills to petrol pumps, to show consumers the health impacts of the climate crisis. Warning labels would be a cheap but potentially highly effective intervention that would make consumers aware of the impact of their purchases on climate breakdown, according to the experts.  “Warning labels connect the abstract threat of the climate emergency with the use of fossil fuels in the here and now, drawing attention to the true cost of fossil fuels pictorially or quantitatively,” they write in the British Medical Journal. “They sensitise people to the consequences of their actions, representing nudges designed to encourage users to choose alternatives to fossil fuels, thus increasing demand for zero-carbon renewable energy.” In many countries smoking labels have grown more graphic in recent years, with pictures of diseased lungs, children breathing smoke and blunt messages covering most of the packaging, in place of the anodyne “smoking can damage your health” warnings of the past. High-carbon health labels could be similarly graphic, especially if they highlighted the damage to health from air pollution caused by fossil fuels, such as the exhaust gases from diesel vehicles. They could include pictures of damaged lungs, or highlight severe weather such as flooding, or show the bodies of people who have died because of heatwaves, said Mike Gill, a former regional director of public health for south-east England, and a co-author of the letter. In some countries, messages could include the increased spread of dengue fever and malaria driven by global heating, while there should also be scope to warn about the effects of environmental degradation caused by climate breakdown, and the harmful effects on water and food supplies, he added. “The messages, including their pictorial element, should be stark and arresting, and they should relate directly to those effects known directly to affect health, such as air pollution causing heart disease and asthma,” he told the Guardian. “The immediate task will be to get some really arresting designs produced, such as we already have for cigarette packet warnings.” Labels warning of the damage to health would make more of an impression on people than messages focusing on the impact on the environment, wrote the experts, who included four professors of environmental health in the UK, US and India. Smoking labels have been accompanied by stricter bans on advertising, and the authors of the BMJ article want to see similar restrictions on advertising by fossil fuel companies, including better policing of misleading claims about investments in renewable energy that represent a minority of a fossil fuel company’s portfolio. Putting labels on high-carbon goods and services would require government intervention, and the authors hope that the UK could lead the way as hosts of the crunch UN climate talks, Cop26, scheduled for Glasgow this November. The experts argue that the warnings could be swiftly adopted so as to “reduce the risk of a rapid rebound in greenhouse gas emissions as the economy expands” after the coronavirus crisis. Green campaigners have also made similar suggestions on putting warning labels on high-carbon goods and services. Previous attempts to put labels on goods that showed the amount of carbon that went into their production petered out, however, as consumers found them hard to understand."

This week we announce the release of our newest major report, Carbon  Dioxide and Earth’s Future: Pursuing the Prudent Path. Based on the  voluminous periodic reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  (IPCC), the ongoing rise in the atmosphere’s CO2 concentration has come to be  viewed as a monumental danger — not only to human society, but to the world of  nature as well. But are the horrific “doomsday scenarios” promulgated by the  climate alarmists as set-in-stone as the public is led to believe? Do  we really know all of the complex and interacting processes that should  be included in the models upon which these scenarios are based? And can we  properly reduce those processes into manageable computer code so as to produce  reliable forecasts 50 or 100 years into the future? At present, the only way to  properly answer these questions is to compare climate model projections with real-world observations. Theory is one thing, but empirical  reality is quite another. The former may or may not be correct, but the  latter is always right. As such, the only truly objective method to  evaluate climate model projections is by comparing them with real-world  data.
In what follows, we conduct just such an appraisal, comparing against  real-world observations ten of the more ominous model-based predictions of what  will occur in response to continued business-as-usual anthropogenic CO2  emissions: (1) unprecedented warming of the planet, (2) more frequent and severe  floods and droughts, (3) more numerous and stronger hurricanes, (4) dangerous  sea level rise, (5) more frequent and severe storms, (6) increased human  mortality, (7) widespread plant and animal extinctions, (8) declining vegetative  productivity, (9) deadly coral bleaching, and (10) a decimation of the planet’s  marine life due to ocean acidification. And in conjunction with these analyses,  we proffer our view of what the future may hold with respect to the climatic and  biological consequences of the ongoing rise in the air’s CO2 content, concluding  by providing an assessment of what we feel should be done about the  situation.

Executive Summary



As presently constituted, earth’s atmosphere contains just  slightly less than 400 ppm of the colorless and odorless gas we call carbon  dioxide or CO2. That’s only four-hundredths of  one percent.  Consequently, even if the air’s CO2 concentration was tripled, carbon dioxide  would still comprise only a little over one tenth of one percent  of the air we breathe, which is far less than what wafted through earth’s  atmosphere eons ago, when the planet was a virtual garden place. Nevertheless, a  small increase in this minuscule amount of CO2 is frequently predicted to  produce a suite of dire environmental consequences, including dangerous global  warming, catastrophic sea level rise, reduced agricultural output, and the  destruction of many natural ecosystems, as well as dramatic increases in extreme  weather phenomena, such as droughts, floods and hurricanes.
As strange as it may seem, these frightening future scenarios are derived  from a single source of information: the ever-evolving computer-driven  climate models that presume to reduce the important physical, chemical  and biological processes that combine to determine the state of earth’s climate  into a set of mathematical equations out of which their forecasts are produced.  But do we really know what all of those complex and interacting  processes are? And even if we did — which we don’t — could we  correctly reduce them into manageable computer code so as to produce reliable  forecasts 50 or 100 years into the future?
Some people answer these questions in the affirmative. However, as may be  seen in the body of this report, real-world observations fail to  confirm essentially all of the alarming predictions of significant  increases in the frequency and severity of droughts, floods and hurricanes that  climate models suggest should occur in response to a global warming of the  magnitude that was experienced by the earth over the past two centuries as it  gradually recovered from the much-lower-than-present temperatures characteristic  of the depths of the Little Ice Age. And other observations have shown that the  rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations associated with the development of the  Industrial Revolution have actually been good for the planet, as they  have significantly enhanced the plant productivity and vegetative water use  efficiency of earth’s natural and agro-ecosystems, leading to a significant  “greening of the earth.”
In the pages that follow, we present this oft-neglected evidence via a review  of the pertinent scientific literature. In the case of the biospheric benefits  of atmospheric CO2 enrichment, we find that with more CO2 in the air, plants  grow bigger and better in almost every conceivable way, and that they do it more  efficiently, with respect to their utilization of valuable natural  resources, and more effectively, in the face of environmental  constraints. And when plants benefit, so do all of the animals and  people that depend upon them for their sustenance.
Likewise, in the case of climate model inadequacies, we reveal their  many shortcomings via a comparison of their “doom and gloom”  predictions with real-world observations. And this exercise  reveals that even though the world has warmed substantially over the past  century or more — at a rate that is claimed by many to have been  unprecedented over the past one to two millennia — this report  demonstrates that none of the environmental catastrophes that are  predicted by climate alarmists to be produced by such a warming has ever come to  pass. And this fact — that there have been no significant increases in  either the frequency or severity of droughts, floods or hurricanes over the past  two centuries or more of global warming — poses an important question. What  should be easier to predict: the effects of global warming on extreme weather  events or the effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations on global  temperature? The first part of this question should, in principle, be  answerable; for it is well defined in terms of the small number of known factors  likely to play a role in linking the independent variable (global warming) with  the specified weather phenomena (droughts, floods and hurricanes). The latter  part of the question, on the other hand, is ill-defined and possibly even  unanswerable; for there are many factors — physical, chemical  and biological — that could well be involved in linking CO2 (or causing  it not to be linked) to global temperature.
If, then, today’s climate models cannot correctly predict what should be  relatively easy for them to correctly predict (the effect of global warming on  extreme weather events), why should we believe what they say about something  infinitely more complex (the effect of a rise in the air’s CO2 content on mean  global air temperature)? Clearly, we should pay the models no heed in the matter  of future climate — especially in terms of predictions based on the  behavior of a non-meteorological parameter (CO2) — until they can  reproduce the climate of the past, based on the behavior of one of the most  basic of all true meteorological parameters (temperature). And even if  the models eventually solve this part of the problem, we should still reserve  judgment on their forecasts of global warming; for there will yet be a vast gulf  between where they will be at that time and where they will have to go to be  able to meet the much greater challenge to which they aspire.

"Footage of Google’s prototype driverless car has got people talking about the potential for self-driving vehicles. While this seems like an exciting new technological advance, in fact the idea is not so new, with numerous large car manufacturers having carried out their own autonomous car programmes as far back as the 1920s, with a “magic highway” system developed in California in the 1990s. It is important that we have a debate about what form cars of the future should take, because personal mobility is an increasingly pressing problem in terms of its environmental impact and sustainability. There are more than a billion cars on the world’s roads – a figure that has doubled over the past 25 years, swelling with the rise of car ownership in the rapidly developing economies such as Brazil, China, and India. With transport responsible for a fifth of global oil use and forecast to be the chief source of future oil use and emissions growth, this is a destructive trend that cannot be sustained for the long term without compromising future generations. In response to the dominance of the internal combustion engine, electric cars have emerged as an alternative. Switching fuels from oil to electricity overcomes much of the dependence on oil and can cut the emissions produced. Governments have introduced subsidies and tax reductions to encourage consumers, public sector bodies and commercial fleets to shift towards electric vehicles. But while manufacturers have brought a steady stream of electrified vehicles to market, sales remain low, costs high, infrastructure insufficient, and standards – such as competing types of charger – have yet to settle. So, as it stands, electric vehicles are not yet considered an attractive alternative for everyone. However, cars that drive themselves could challenge the status quo, changing our relationship with cars and pulling more drivers into the sphere of electric vehicles. They could be shared, increasing sociability and social inclusion, and offering an opportunity to those unable to buy a car outright. Google’s model in fact moves away from private ownership, taking the risk out of substantial investment decisions. Only for use over short distances, concerns about fuel, range and other worries would not be a concern. Another effect of self-driving cars might be to encourage more cycling and walking, as roads full of automatically-driven cars will (we hope) be safer – drivers are after all prone to fatigue, mood changes, emotional impulses, distraction or intoxication. In contrast, self-driving cars are computer controlled, so there will be no impulsive or hasty decisions that could lead to injury. The cars are also programmed to avoid certain obstacles – a child running into the road would trigger the sensors, for example. And towns and cities that are more accommodating to cyclists and pedestrians means a lower carbon footprint for the daily commute. For those who cannot drive, for example through disability or age, cars that drive themselves would help connect cut-off communities, and provide a means of transport and so a way of maintaining personal independence. Even those under the legal driving age could benefit from the a means of transport that doesn’t require a driver. Of course, there are drawbacks too, chief of which is that introducing self-driving cars might encourage more vehicles onto the roads. Rather than replace existing cars, Google’s new cars might be bought as additional cars. They might actually compete with public transport such as buses, trains and metro systems – Google are positioning the cars as a replacement for taxis. If so, instead of improving transport sustainability, autonomous cars could end up generating more journeys, requiring more power, and generate more emissions (from electrical power and from manufacture). And again, Google’s driverless cars will benefit short-distance urban travellers more than those in less connected rural areas, as they require strong internet connections for access to maps and GPS systems. Both are commonplace in cities, but less so in the countryside where transport is more keenly needed. In the UK, 87% of rural dwellers hold driving licenses, compared with only 65% for those in built-up metropolitan areas, falling to 62% in London. Google’s futuristic cars won’t benefit those countryside communities suffering from transport poverty. So, in this outpouring of futuristic comment on Google’s driverless cars, while it raises an interesting debate about mobility that needs to be had, neither we nor those designing it should pretend the driverless car holds the solutions to the 21st-century transport we need to start planning for."
"$11.50 for a kilogram of broccoli. $8 a bunch for fresh celery. The price of some vegetables in Australia has gone up considerably recently. These price increases have led many people to take to social media, accusing major supermarkets and independent retailers of profiteering and price gouging at a time of crisis. However, Shaun Lindhe, the communications manager for peak vegetable growers body AusVeg, suggests that the price increases have more to do with another story, one that has fallen from the headlines in recent weeks: the ongoing, devastating droughts and bushfires that ravaged Australia over the summer. “There’s been a reduced supply as a result of drought,” Lindhe says. “There’s also seasonal fluctuations in supply, as production regions transition.” The reduced supply has coincided with panicked shoppers clearing shelves, driving prices even higher. On 24 March, ACCC chair Rod Sims directly attributed grocery price hikes to “unnecessary panic buying”, saying: “Australia’s supermarkets have experienced unprecedented demand for groceries in recent weeks, both in store and online, which has led to shortages of some products and disruption to delivery services. “In order to meet that demand growers and retailers have been working to try and keep that supply on supermarket shelves,” says Lindhe, “and as a result some of the production costs in terms of labour and transport have gone up.” In January, well before the novel coronavirus crisis hit Australian shores and shifted consumer behaviour, growers warned of a 50% increase in vegetable prices. Now a supply shortage is coinciding with a spike in demand. Matthew Broadbent, a produce manager for Green Green Grocer, a small vegetable box delivery service in Melbourne, has noticed the price hikes at a wholesale level. “It is across the board, but especially broccoli, celery and cauliflower,” Broadbent tells Guardian Australia. “As a percentage, we’re looking at as much as double in some cases … Prices do go up and down at times, but I’ve never seen it like this before. “At the moment our margins are a lot slimmer,” Broadbent says, although he has seen an increase in customers over the last few weeks too.  Broadbent’s experience chimes with statements from Coles and Woolworths. “Coles has seen wholesale price increases on some fresh produce lines due to factors including limited availability as a result of bushfires and drought,” a representative tells Guardian Australia. A Woolworths spokesperson, meanwhile, says: “Due to pressures throughout the horticultural supply chain caused by drought, unseasonal weather and an unprecedented spike in demand, we’re currently seeing an impact on the availability of some fresh fruit and vegetable lines. This has led to higher wholesale costs for some fruit and vegetable lines across the market.” “The price of vegetables, like many commodities, is set by supply and demand,” says Lindhe. Both supermarkets firmly deny price hikes are a result of profit-seeking, with a Coles spokesperson saying that “Coles has absorbed some of these increases”. “I haven’t heard of any reports of price gouging,” says Lindhe. “The situation we’ve got at the moment is that the level of supply has lowered ... and that coupled with the increased demand ... as a result the prices have gone up.” Because the “vast majority” of fresh vegetables available in Australia are grown locally, Lindhe does not expect international supply chain issues caused by the Covid-19 crisis to impact Australians. Lindhe is optimistic that the situation will resolve itself soon. “As availability of fresh produce increases over time, as we expect it will, demand levels will resume to what we normally expect for this time of year, and as a result of that, price will lower to reflect the increased availability.” In the short term, major supermarkets have also relaxed their specifications for the size and cosmetic appearance of vegetables, in order to increase supply, ABC reports.  While the Covid-19 crisis and drought have driven vegetable prices up, Australians can look forward to cheaper high end seafood this autumn, as export demand for Australian seafood plummets. Josh Pearce, of the Fish Shoppe in Melbourne, tells Guardian Australia that the price of rock lobster has almost halved in recent months. “The main market was China and retailed at Christmas for $150. It has now dropped to $100 when the Chinese market closed and this weekend we will be selling at $85 a kilogram, which is nearly half of its original price.” Pearce notes that mud crabs and sashimi-grade yellowfin tuna are also particularly cheap at the moment, as restaurants and export markets close. “Australians can now enjoy higher-end species … at bargain price.” "

How better to create division within a community or a country than to push a narrative that will divide us. 



Sell the idea that men can be women and women can be men, and Bob’s your uncle (or aunt) and there will be an argument or a passionate debate between those that agree or disagree. Religious debate is the current flagship. Israel Folau and whether you are for him or against him is a whopper for dividing a gathering into two camps. 



In the old days, the advice on running a successful get together was to avoid the subjects of politics and religion and to stick to discussing the weather. Well, that is now off limits. Discussing the weather is the petrol on the fire that will burn the house down. Climate Change, Global Warming, Climate Emergency will sure as faith turn the most innocent comment – “hasn’t it been chilly lately?” – into a showdown about coal (to burn or not to burn). 



**Humour has been taken off the table.** It is racist, homophobic, islamophobic, sociophobic or pick a prefix out of a hat-phobic. 



Gone are the days when you could watch an advertisement on TV that was mildly amusing or just plain clever. Back in the 90’s I used to race home from work to watch the Speights ads (the ones about the young bloke from Auckland who moved to Southland when he inherited his grandfather’s farm and Clydesdales… the young female vet and the young Northerner were guaranteed to fall in love… but each new ad ended at the pub where they drank a Speights. I loved those ads! 



Now TV is full of blended families, same-sex families and diversity driven marketing that have caused me to boycott so many brands that I am back to the farmers market and bugger the lot of them. 



Even the trip to the supermarket has me reaching for my glasses to inspect the label to see if the product is imported from the wrong country, manufactured by the wrong company or contains the wrong ingredient. 



**Our entire lifestyle, belief system, social fabric, education system and history has been divided by diversity.**



Divide and conquer. Replace joy with fear and suspicion. Put people into two groups who stand on opposing sides of the metaphorical room – one to the left and one to the right. 



You see, when people disagree on virtually everything in life – from the birth of babies to the education and nurturing of children; from politics to paedophilia and marriage to marketing it stops us from uniting.



I read a great quote the other day from Donald Trump which seems to say it all.



 **“They are not after me. They are after you. I’m just standing in their way.”**



I think I need a Speights and to listen to Nancy Sinatra singing about those boots…

This issue of _The Current Wisdom_ is a departure from our usual format, where Senior Fellow Patrick J. Michaels normally reviews interesting items on global warming in the scientific literature that may not have received the media attention that they deserved, or have been misinterpreted in the popular press.  
  
Instead, this Wisdom examines the reaction to a scientific paper, described in last month’s version, showing that recent annual ice melt from Greenland, while certainly elevated, does not appear appreciably different from melt values simulated for the early and mid‐​20th century.  
  
 _The Current Wisdom_ only comments on science appearing in the refereed, peer‐​reviewed literature, or that has been peer‐​screened prior to presentation at a scientific congress.  
  
Previous editions of Wisdom, which began in 2010, are available at our blog Cato@Liberty.



To practicing scientists, the most significant revelation in the November 2009 stack of purloined University of East Anglia emails known worldwide now as “Climategate” were the plans to harass editors of refereed scientific journals who accepted papers from the (erroneously labeled) climate “skeptics.” There was also disturbing evidence of collusion between the some of the Climategate principals and more agreeable editors.



See for yourself, as revealed in the emails. Here are a few highlights. The first refers to _Geophysical Research Letters_ (“GRL”), and was sent on January 20, 2005.

Dear All,



Just a heads up. Apparently, the contrarians now have an “in” with GRL. This guy Saiers has a prior connection w/​the University of Virginia Dept.of Environmental Sciences that causes me some unease.



I think we now know how the various Douglass et al papers w/​Michaels and Singer, the Soon et al paper, and now this one have gotten published in GRL,

Mike,



This is truly awful. GRL has gone downhill rapidly in recent years. I think the decline began before Saiers. I have had some unhelpful dealings with him recently with regard to a paper Sarah and I have on glaciers — it was well received by the referees, and so is in the publication pipeline. However, I got the impression that Saiers was trying to keep it from being published.



Proving bad behavior here is very difficult. If you think that Saiers is in the greenhouse skeptics camp, then, if we can find documentary evidence of this, we could go through official AGU channels to get him ousted. Even this would be difficult… 



Tom.



===========================================================



Thanks Tom,



Yeah, basically this is just a heads up to people that something might be up here. What a shame that would be. It’s one thing to lose “Climate Research”. We can’t afford to lose GRL. I think it would be useful if people begin to record their experiences w/​both Saiers and potentially Mackwell (I don’t know him — he would seem to be complicit w/​what is going on here).



If there is a clear body of evidence that something is amiss, it could be taken through the proper channels. I don’t that the entire AGU hierarchy has yet been compromised!

Michael E. Mann wrote:



Hi Malcolm,



… I don’t believe a response in GRL is warranted in any case. The MM claims in question are debunked in other papers that are in press and in review elsewhere. I’m not sure that GRL can be seen as an honest broker in these debates anymore, and it is probably best to do an end run around GRL now where possible. They have published far too many deeply flawed contrarian papers in the past year or so. There is no possible excuse for them publishing all 3 Douglass papers and the Soon et al paper. These were all pure crap.



There appears to be a more fundamental problem w/​GRL now, unfortunately…



Mike



[“MM” in this case refers to a paper by Steve McIntyre and Ross McKitrick called “Hockey Sticks, Principal Components, and Spurious Significance”. Michael Mann is the creator of the original “hockey stick” reconstruction of global temperature]



The exchange shows key scientists discussing removing journal editors who allowed papers to be published that disagreed with their findings or methodology. They identify the suspect editors in question and then suggest collecting data on their activities to potentially be used in getting them ousted.



There is also discussion about boycotting (i.e. “do an end run around”) the offending journals. And when all else fails, they attempt to “redefine” what they consider to be the peer‐​reviewed literature.



These shenanigans prompted waves of nausea both within and outside of the climate community. So, has the lesson been learned that maybe it’s not a good idea to go beyond the normal rules of scientific civility and to actually cultivate a bit of climate science diversity?



No. Consider the developments since our last _Current Wisdom_ article, “Please Sell Me Your Beach House.”



I was an author of a recently published a paper in _Journal of Geophysics Research‐​Atmospheres_ , which examined the magnitude current ice melt taking in Greenland compared with a statistical estimate of what has taken place there for the past 225 years. We were able to go back to the late 18th century because of a remarkable record of weather stations established by the Danish colonists.



We concluded that while the melt in recent years was quite high, it probably wasn’t unprecedented. _JGR_ uses a single‐​blind review process—that is, there were three reviewers who were anonymous to us, but they knew who we were. The double‐​blind review processes, while common in other disciplines, and relatively rare in climate science, which is probably one of the systematic problems in the discipline that created an atmosphere primed for Climategate‐​like storms. The fact that editors have not changed this policy in light of the Climategate emails is an ominous portent.



After our paper was published, one of the previously anonymous reviewers revealed himself through a blog entry on his website. This individual was Dr. Jason Box, geography professor at Ohio State University who has done a lot of work on the Greenland ice, and was therefore well‐​qualified to review our work (and in fact, was one of the people that we suggested to _JGR_ as a potential reviewer of our paper). His blog entry was not about how a paper that he recently reviewed perhaps shed some new light on the longer term history of ice melt across Greenland, but instead was highly (to put it mildly) critical of our results as well as the review process at _JGR_ , and for good measure, as if it was somehow relevant to the science in our paper, decided to trot out the old “denialism” war horse and to explain that he, Box, is “inspired by scientific denialism.” 



Here are some excerpts from Box’s blog posts titled “selective science=pseudo science”:



“I was invited by Dr. Guosheng Liu – Associate Editor – Journal of Geophysical Research ( _JGR_ ) – Atmospheres to review the article. Sara Pryor was the _JGR_ chief editor ultimately responsible for this paper’s review.”… [Note to readers: this information is not normally revealed. Doing so is a clear attempt to incite an academic lynch mob.]



“The Editor’s decision whether or not to accept the paper would have been made sometime early 2011. This paper should not have been accepted for publication without taking into account important new data.”… [emphasis in original]



“Unfortunately, the paper represents not only a failure of the review process, but an intentional exclusion of data that would, if included, undermine the paper’s thesis.”… 



“A documented campaign of climate change denialism, of which the authors Frauenfeld, Knappenberger, Michaels are a documented part, seeks to undermine the well‐​established science that demonstrates unequivocally the reality of anthropogenic climate change, characterized by global warming among other changes in the climate system.”… 



[Questions to readers: has the author of _The Current Wisdom_ ever said, for decades, that humans are not changing global surface temperature? Is it not the nature of science to “undermine” what is “well‐​established”?]



“I, Jason E. Box, am a physical climatologist focusing on Greenland ice‐​climate interactions since 1993. My agenda is the philosophy (a.k.a. the search for truth) about Greenland’s climate variations. I am inspired by scientific denialism to counter pseudo‐​science on the important topic of climate change.”



Jason Box is naming the responsible editors at _JGR_ , saying that the peer‐​review process there failed, and then pointing out what evil people the authors are especially when compared to himself. What the latter has to do with the former is unclear, unless he is somehow trying to slip in that Liu and Pryor are potential denialist sympathizers.



So much for the lessons of Climategate.



Judith Curry is the Head of the Earth and Atmospheric Science department at Georgia Tech, who runs a very popular climate science blog. Her take on all of this is very interesting:



Regarding editor Gusheng Liu:



“The editor on this one was Guosheng Liu, my former postdoc and collaborator; a more honest, fair, and conscientious editor would be hard to find.”



On Box’s reaction:



“So, some climate change skeptics actually got a fair shake in the review process by an editor (Guosheng Liu), and a “consensus” reviewer is outraged.”



The “important new data” that Box said we were evading is the 2010 melt data. It is a combination of records from three different sources, which are not even available until late in the following year.



In fact, because this paper was so long in the review process (for reasons that should be obvious), we had to revise it by including 2008 and 2009 data.



We also would like to assure Dr. Box, who surely knows this, that inclusion of 2010 data, which, from preliminary data, appears to be a very high melt year (but not significantly different from other high ones) would in fact have strengthened our results. The more data one has, especially at the extremes, the more robust the subsequent model is.



At any rate Climategate lives on. Now, as then, any editor who dares to publish anything that does not imply the end‐​of‐​the‐​world‐​as‐​we‐​know‐​it‐​pronto risks loss of confidentiality or worse. “You’ve been warned. Back off. Once these people are mad, honest, I can’t control them.”



What an awful profession climate science has become.

"I drafted this while looking north over the frozen Lincoln Sea, at the northernmost tip of Ellesmere Island in Canada. I was at Alert, a Canadian Forces Station which, at 82°N, is the most northerly permanently inhabited place on Earth. Just 815km away, across the Arctic Ocean, lay the North Pole.  It was May, and the sea should have still been frozen, but this year the bridge of sea ice between Ellesmere and Greenland broke up early, and Arctic ice began flowing down the narrow Nares Channel and south into Baffin Bay. All across the Arctic Ocean, the amount and persistence of sea ice is declining – September ice cover has fallen around 30% since 1980.  The Arctic is warming at twice the rate of the rest of the planet, and images of polar bears on small ice floes capture the imagination. But those images represent (excusing the pun) only the tip of the iceberg – the consequences of ice loss are profound and start from the very bottom of the food chain, in the microbial processes that drive the biology of the ocean. Sea ice forms when seawater temperature falls below -1.8℃. As the ice crystals form, salt is forced out and ice brines and other dissolved constituents become trapped in a honeycomb of small channels in the ice. Cold salty water draining from the ice also sinks deep to the bottom of the oceans and drives water circulation across the globe. As the air grows colder, the ice thickens downwards and, in the brine channels and across the ice bottom, specialised algae and bacteria grow. When sunlight returns to the Arctic in the spring and penetrates through the ice (which is rarely more than a few metres thick) these ice-algal communities start to photosynthesise, producing algal biomass and abundant dissolved organic matter. This feeds a wide range of microscopic creatures known as zooplankton, which graze across the bottom of the ice. These zooplankton in turn feed larger animals and drive the food chain throughout spring. When the ice melts more of this material flows out into the seas, providing more food resources at the bottom of food chains. In a recent study published in Nature Climate Change, colleagues and I showed how the different components of this organic matter derived from ice-algae are used by different species of bacteria and at different rates in underlying seawater, so that more melting ice will change the patterns of organic matter turnover in surface waters during spring.  Not all sea ice melts each summer – or at least it didn’t. Multi-year ice can go through a number of years of melting and growing, getting thicker and more structurally complex. But, over time, this multi-year ice has become rarer. In the 1980s, around one-third of the Arctic’s ice cover was more than four years old – today, such ice is almost nonexistent. Instead, more first-year ice will form and completely melt each year, providing new food inputs into areas of ocean that were previously permanently covered in ice. This has significant consequences. Less ice cover in summer means more open ocean water, which – as it is darker – absorbs more sunlight and heat, making it harder to freeze in the autumn. Open water also means the wind can stir up the sea and slow the process of refreezing. More open water in summer will change the plankton communities, and then the animals that feed on them.  Some species are moving north. Already the Barents Sea between Norway and Svalbard is now rarely covered in ice in winter – and North Atlantic species such as cod and top predators such as orca are moving in. Specialist species that rely on ice such as polar bears, ringed seals, walrus and Arctic cod are losing their habitats, while non-indigenous species are expanding their range. For some, a warmer Arctic brings opportunities. Reduced ice cover means ships can use the north-east and north-west passages, significantly shortening journey times between the Atlantic and the Pacific. New fisheries may develop, and less ice means access to oil and gas resources becomes possible. But these benefits to some, come at potentially huge costs. In addition to the changes in the ocean, a warmer Arctic could disrupt ocean circulation and global weather systems, while permafrost will continue to thaw, potentially releasing greenhouse gases currently locked up in frozen soils.   A whole ecosystem, rich in specialist species – many barely studied – is changing before our eyes. The Arctic is a beautiful and harsh place, posing serious logistical challenges for scientific investigation. But even there, on the top of the world, far from centres of human population, our impact is evident. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter. Climate change is inevitable.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThose who have been monitoring the environmental movement in Germany over the years know that it is driven by an elitist, authoritarian and intolerant class of people who at times don’t refrain showing their contempt for democracy.
Now Manfred Güllner, the founder and director of one of Germany’s leading pollsters, the Forsa Institute, confirms our deep concerns as he speaks out on the green movement in an interview with Der Spiegel. Remind you that Güllner is the Prince of Pollsters in Germany.
Güllner has released a new book, and according to Spiegel he wrote that the “green dictatorship” threatens “the second attempt to firmly establish democracy in Germany”.
When pressed on this claim, the 71-year old Güllner defends it, saying that since the Federal Republic of Germany has been founded, he observes that democracy entails much effort for Germans, and reminds us that “sociologically speaking, the original nucleus of the movement stems from the Weimar period and today the green movement is in the same anti-modern segment of society, a radicalized part of the German middle class”.
In the interview Spiegel asks:  “You claim the greens scare the voters away from the voting booths, and that the shrinking voter turnout undermines democracy. Why do you say that?”
Güllner: In local elections, one sees a clear relationship: The higher the percentage of votes that the greens get, the lower the voter turnout. It’s also clear to see internationally. Over the last 30 years, nowhere in western countries has voter turnout dropped more than in Germany. At the same time, the greens have gotten especially strong here.”

He uses the southern industrial state of Baden Wurttemberg, which not long ago elected a Green Party governor, Winfried Kretschmann, as an example. Güllner tells Spiegel:
In Baden-Württemberg Winfried Kretschmann got only 16 percent of all eligible voters behind him, yet he was able to derive a mandate for a radical political change. No wonder that many people there do not feel represented.”
Güllner explains that the success of the greens is based on populist environmental issues, like who isn’t against a clean environment and peace? He adds:
The greens also have massive support from scientists and a large part of the German mass media. This media-scientific support give the greens an impact that is much bigger than what they really are.”
This is no exaggeration. Green activists, politicians and organizations are constantly interviewed as “experts” and “authorities” in the media. And they are rarely criticized.
Güllner ends the interview saying that the mainstream parties (CDU and SPD) have gotten too green, and that the green party needs to deflate its ego, as it is exercising a disproportionate amount of influence.

"**The North East's move into tier three has been labelled ""a crushing blow"" to hospitality and entertainment venues.**
The region will face the toughest Covid-19 restrictions when the national lockdown ends on 2 December.
It means pubs, bars, restaurants, cinemas, theatres and other indoor venues will remain closed.
Adrian Waddell, chief executive of Newcastle's NE1 Business Improvement District company, said he hoped the region would soon move to tier two.
""While this is good news for our retailers, it's a crushing blow for our hospitality sector, only allowed to offer takeaways if they open at all,"" he said.
""The transmission rates for the city and the wider region have shown a steady decline over the past week so we must stand a good chance of moving down the tiers.""
Dave Stone, who runs Wylam Brewery, said even the more relaxed restrictions requiring pubs to serve alcohol only with substantial meals were ""unfair.""
""The big problem for us is the ridiculous rule that you need to have a meal with a beer,"" he said.
""Nobody can tell me why if you have got a pasty and a salad you won't get coronavirus, but if you only have a pint you will.""
Bosses at the Tyneside Cinema in Newcastle had hoped to reopen next week.
Simon Drysdale, the independent cinema's interim chief executive, said: ""We are very disappointed as we had a brilliant programme in place in the run up to Christmas.
""However we will wait, and hope, that when the rules are reviewed, we may be able to open.""

For the last few years a number of financial managers have been spending increasing resources to prod the companies they invest in to adopt more environmentally conscious and socially aware policies in their businesses. Many publicly‐​held corporations have had to deal with multiple shareholder resolutions annually intended to force them to adopt more socially or environmentally aware perspectives. Other investment fund managers have begun voting their proxies in favor of such shareholder resolutions, while taking other actions to encourage what they deem to be more socially salutary behavior.   
  
  
However, there is an inherent conflict in such resolutions coming from investors: after all, the inevitable result of a corporation bowing to a proxy vote and prioritizing such activities is that it would reduce its profits–a bad thing for those who hold stock in the company.   
  
  
Not so fast, say the activists driving this movement: while they may be pushing companies to pursue environmentally and socially responsible activities for their own political goals, they aver that such actions actually make good business sense as well, and that these will ultimately increase the profits of these companies. One oft‐​used rationale for resolutions pertinent to climate change is that these actions improve the long run sustainability of the company, which rational shareholders will value and thus will be reflected in the stock price.   
  
  
While the firm‐​as‐​pure‐​profit‐​maximizer may be a perspective that fails to capture the complexity that is today’s multinational corporation, the notion that investor activists are somehow doing shareholders a favor and helping corporations correct a blind spot in their vision is absurd, and earlier this week the Department of Labor finally declared that to be the case.   
  
  
The DOL declared that financial managers can no longer justify pushing environmentally or socially beneficial investments on the grounds that they are inherently beneficial for shareholders. Specifically, it wrote that:   




“fiduciaries may not sacrifice returns or assume greater risks to promote collateral environmental, social, or corporate governance (ESG) policy goals when making investment decisions.”



The Labor Department’s actions effectively make it more difficult for activists to pursue social policy via proxy battles, which is precisely how it should be. Such efforts represent nothing less than an attempt to effectively tax the retirement wealth of savers to advance a political agenda.

"How will climate change remake our world in the 21st century? Will we be able to adapt and survive? As with many things, the past is a good guide for the future. Humans have experienced climate changes in the past that have transformed their environment – studying their response could tell us something about our own fate. Human populations and cultures died out and were replaced throughout Eurasia during the last 500,000 years. How and why one prehistoric population displaced another is unclear, but these ancient people were exposed to climate changes that changed their natural environment in turn. We looked at the region around Lyon, France, and imagined how Stone Age hunter gatherers 30,000-50,000 years ago would have fared as the world around them changed. Here, as elsewhere in Eurasia during colder periods, the environment would have shifted towards tundra-like vegetation – vast, open habitats that may have been best suited for running down prey while hunting. When the climate warmed for a few centuries, trees would have spread – creating dense woods which favour hunting methods involving ambush.  How these changes affected a population’s hunting behaviour could have decided whether they prospered, were forced to migrate, or even died out. The ability of hunter gatherers to detect prey at different distances and in different environments would have decided who dominated and who was displaced.  


      Read more:
      Humans are not off the hook for extinctions of large herbivores – then or now


 Short of building a time machine, finding out how prehistoric people responded to climate change could only be possible by recreating their worlds as virtual environments. Here, researchers could control the mix and density of vegetation and enlist modern humans to explore them and see how they fared finding prey. We designed a video game environment and asked volunteers to find red deer in it. The world they explored changed to scrub and grassland as the climate cooled and thick forest as it warmed. The participants could spot red deer at a greater distance in grassland than in woodland, when the density of vegetation was the same. As vegetation grew thicker they struggled to detect prey at greater distances in both environments, but more so in woodland. Prehistoric people would have faced similar struggles as the climate warmed, but there’s an interesting pattern that tells us something about human responses to change. Creeping environmental change didn’t affect deer spotting performance in the experiment until a certain threshold of forest had given way to grassland, or vice-versa. Suddenly, after the landscape was more than 30% forested, participants were significantly less able to spot deer at greater distances. As an open environment became more wooded, this could have been the tipping point at which running down prey became a less viable strategy, and hunters had to switch to ambush.  This is likely the critical moment at which ancient populations were forced to change their hunting habits, relocate to areas more favourable for their existing techniques, or face local extinction. As the modern climate warms and ecosystems change, our own survival could become threatened by these sudden tipping points. The effects of climate change on human populations may not be intuitive. Our lifestyles may seem to continue working just fine up until a certain point. But that moment of crisis, when it does arrive, will often dictate the outcome – adapt, move or die.

"Britain’s homes are responsible for almost a third of the nation’s energy use, despite decades of gradually improving energy efficiency. For the UK to meet its targets for carbon emissions reductions by 2050, around 600,000 homes per year will need to be renovated to generate sufficiently large energy savings.  But at the moment only a few hundred are being renovated to a high energy saving standard each year – many more people will need to be encouraged to take on the job for themselves and bring their homes up to modern standards. Homeowners that have already done so can help make the case for others to follow, being as they are pioneers, and occasionally they open their homes to the public. For example, those homeowners in the Superhome nework, the longest established open home network in the UK, launched by the Sustainable Energy Academy in 2006. Our study published recently in the Buildings Research and Information journal examined the experiences of Superhome owner-occupiers, to discover who they were, their motivations, and the costs and benefits of renovation. We conducted an online survey with 57 Superhome owner-occupiers (about half of all relevant households), and 14 detailed interviews. We found that compared with a typical English owner-occupier, Superhome owners are on average better educated, live in larger household groups and larger homes, and have higher incomes – characteristics that are commonly found in those with pro-environmental values. Perhaps more surprising was the wide range of incomes: while many are better off than average, a significant proportion of Superhome owners live on much lower-than-average incomes. Having money helps, but low energy renovating is not the preserve of the well-off. Of course, one of the benefits of energy efficient homes is that they cost less to run. Households had on average installed ten energy efficiency or renewable energy measures. The most popular were loft insulation (100%), wall insulation (91%), double-glazed or other high-performance windows (81%), and solar panels (77%). All these techniques and technologies that can deliver energy savings and low carbon buildings are well understood, and most households undertook similar work. What this study confirms is that effective low carbon renovation work can be carried out over a long period. Renovation could be completed in less than six months or take several decades, with the most common time period (30% of respondents) being between two and five years. Renovations can also be split into those planned from the start (60%), and those which developed over time (40%). Almost universally, the reasons householders wanted to renovate their homes were to reduce energy use and carbon emissions, with other benefits including better warmth and comfort in the house and reduced energy bills. During the interviews we explored their motivations in more detail: some were driven by environmental concerns, others focused more on reducing waste, others still saw energy reduction as part of process towards a better quality of life. As researchers are beginning to understand, deciding to renovate is not a simple or single issue decision. Superhome owners are often asked about the cost. This can be surprisingly hard to answer, for two reasons. For a start, detailed records may not have been kept. And also distinguishing the additional costs of energy saving measures from the other renovations taking place at the same can be very difficult. For example, many home owners take advantage of trigger points, such as when extending their homes, to introduce low energy measures at the same time. Our interviewees estimated spending between a few thousand into the low tens of thousands of pounds on their renovations. Lower cost renovations usually involved an element of DIY. Most Superhome owners think in terms of whether the work will deliver the benefits they want, and whether it is affordable. One interviewee said: Everyone always asks ‘what’s the payback?’ Actually the most important thing is I now have a house that’s warm in the winter and cool in the summer, and frankly I didn’t have that before because in the winter, all the heating was on maximum and it all went straight out the windows and walls. So now it’s a very nice place to live. None of the Superhome owners funded their renovations purely through loans or mortgages, most used a combination of savings and other finance or paid for them out of income, particularly if carrying out the work over a long period. So what would encourage more people to undertake low carbon renovation? While we have shown that many different combination of planning, financing and timing can be successful, taking action comes down to means, motive and opportunity. People need access to finance, knowledge, and advice, as well as DIY skills or skilled professionals. Low carbon retrofits engage with many important values and aspirations – the renovation must deliver benefits beyond just energy savings. And there must be an understanding of the opportunities to incorporate low-carbon options wherever and whenever possible. Find the sweet spot that provides a means to get this combination right, and we might see more people taking the chance to live in better heated, more comfortable, cheaper, greener homes."
"Days after the British parliament declared a “climate emergency”, The Guardian announced that it would start using “stronger” language to discuss the environment. Its updated style guide states that “climate change” no longer accurately reflects the seriousness of the situation and journalists are advised to use “climate emergency”, “climate crisis” or “climate breakdown” instead. Though it may seem inconsequential, language choices really do matter. How we label an issue determines how we frame it. Back in 2003, Frank Luntz told the US Bush administration that it’s time to start talking about “climate change” instead of “global warming”, because the former sounds less frightening. Explaining The Guardian’s decision, editor-in-chief Katharine Viner said that “climate change” sounds “gentle” when in fact scientists are describing “a catastrophe”. While scientists’ responses to this move have been mixed, The Guardian’s changing language is prompting reviews in newsrooms around the world. In Norway, the Morgenbladet recently announced that it will follow The Guardian’s example. But how novel is The Guardian’s use of “strong” language and what could be its impact? An opinion piece published in The Guardian a few days after its style guide was updated argued that “the climate crisis” needs to be covered in the same way as “the start of the second world war” and that the duty of the news media is to “awaken the world to the catastrophe looming ahead of it”. The Guardian and other leading British newspapers already have a history of reporting on the environment in ways that resemble covering a protracted state of armed hostility. Op-eds and editorials published in The Guardian have often used metaphors to talk about climate change in terms of war. We have read many times of carbon tax proposal “battles” led by “eco-warriors”. War metaphors might yield positive results. They may create the necessary conditions for politicians to push ambitious proposals for dealing with climate change, the same way the threat of invasion galvanised British resolve to mass produce weapons and implement rationing in World War II. But the “strong” language of “breakdown”, “crisis”, “emergency” and “war” may have unintended consequences. Evoking war instils fear in readers, and much has been written about these “fear appeals” and climate change. Some suggest that scaring the public about climate change will motivate individual action and stimulate support for wider social change. Even if this strategy succeeded some of the time, wars are destructive and divisive. Addressing climate change means working together. Fear appeals might also have the opposite effect to what is intended, causing indifference, apathy and feelings of powerlessness. When people see a problem as too big, they might stop believing that anything can be done to solve it. If fear is to motivate people, then studies suggest that a solution must also be presented to focus minds on action. Surveys of Norwegians aged 16–17 conducted in 2013-14 showed that young people wanted to learn about the positives – how they could contribute to reducing the dramatic consequences of climate change. It was their optimism about the future that drove their engagement with the issue and their commitment to act, not fear. As millions of young people worldwide join Greta Thunberg on the school climate strikes, is there any doubt that people want the chance to apply their skills and passion to solving climate change? Many “wars” have been declared by politicians – on drugs, obesity and poverty – which were fought on the pages of newspapers. Negativity has traditionally been key to defining what is news. News tends to be about bad things that are happening in the world. After all, we never hear a journalist tell us they’re “reporting live from a country where a war hasn’t broken out”. Informing people about wars, crises and emergencies is an important part of the media’s role, but we may have reached “peak negativity”, where the news is so full of serious crises that people are increasingly avoiding it. They are left feeling disengaged, demotivated and depressed about the state of the world and their role in it. Constructive journalism should take a solution-focused approach that covers problems with the appropriate seriousness, but also answers the inevitable “what now?”, by describing how similar problems have been addressed elsewhere in the world. Awareness of climate change is high and growing, but the potential solutions need more attention. In May, The Guardian joined the Covering Climate Now project, which aims to identify and share coverage of climate change that is as much about solutions as about detailing the problem itself. Perhaps this should have been the story that grabbed the headlines instead of redefining the “climate crisis”. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter. Climate change is inevitable.

"**When England went into a national lockdown on 5 November, it left behind a three-tiered system of restrictions designed to keep the virus under control.**
Now the system is returning - although with stricter rules and more areas in the toughest, third tier. So has the lockdown worked - and why was it necessary in the first place?
Between 14 October, when the tiers were introduced, and 5 November when they were replaced, cases continued to rise across the country. The weekly number rose in every region - by half in London, more than three-quarters in the East of England and, in the South East and the West Midlands, it more than doubled.
In the North West and North East, though, cases began to level off, rising by only 6% and 10% respectively.
It suggests the highest tier may have had some impact - the North West, where cases rose the least, was largely in tier three. But tier two had little effect in most of the country, while in many tier-one areas - particularly in the South East - cases rose quickly.
The government's independent advisers, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) concluded: ""Tier-one measures alone are not enough to prevent the epidemic from growing rapidly.""
It estimated cases could shrink by a ""modest"" 10% when moving from tier one to tier two.
And even for tier three - as it stood before 5 November (less stringent than it will be from 2 December) - it was ""unclear"" whether those restrictions alone would be enough to cause the epidemic to shrink ""at a regional or national level"".
Case numbers did fall in some areas under the tier system, at a more local level. For example, in Manchester and Liverpool they fell by about a third and a half respectively. Labour and Conservative MPs have criticised the government for not factoring in the differences in rates within regions when assigning tiers - putting the whole of the North East into tier three, for example.
This picture of generally rising cases sets the scene for why the government might have felt a second lockdown was necessary. Beyond the over-arching aim of ensuring that numbers falling ill are as low as possible, case numbers need to be reasonably low for the test-and-trace system to have a shot at controlling the epidemic.
According to Sage: ""Test and trace, including mass testing, is most effective when prevalence is low. Even the most effective test-and-trace system will have little impact when caseloads are high.""
And the lockdown does appear to have turned the tide in most of the country. Cases fell by about a third in the North East and South West, and about a half in the North West and in Yorkshire and the Humber.
But case numbers take much longer to fall than they do to rise. One estimate suggested for every day of cases increasing, it could take five days for them to come back down again.
You can see this in the figures. Whereas some areas' cases more than doubled while the tier system was in place, the most dramatic falls under lockdown were only half that rate over the same period.
In London, the South East and in the East of England, cases remained virtually static - rising at first immediately after lockdown, perhaps because of pre-lockdown socialising, before starting to decline slightly.
But the government has judged that there are now enough cases to return the country to restrictions that, while slightly looser than in the lockdown, are tougher within each tier than they were before it.
Fears of what a lockdown in the run-up to Christmas might do to already-struggling shops and restaurants are likely to have been in the prime minister's mind.
Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said the new tiers have been based on factors that include numbers of positive tests and the pressures on the NHS.
The government is also looking at the numbers involving people aged over 60 and the rate at which cases are rising or falling.
But if you plot every local area on a graph, it's clear the the overall number of cases per 100,000 people is the main deciding factor.
The regions with the highest number of cases are generally in tier three, those in the middle in tier two and those with the lowest number of cases are in tier one.
That's why, for example, the North East is in tier three and London in tier two, even though the region has had a much bigger fall in cases, comparatively, than the capital. The North East still has almost twice the number of cases that London has.
It is thought that there won't be much movement between tiers before Christmas.

For the first time in a few years, I went to a political meeting yesterday morning. The sitting MP had arranged a “SuperBlues” meeting, with Paula Bennett advertised as guest speaker. I thought that I would go and raise my thought that losing freedom of speech is the greatest threat facing us today.



Rather than Paula Bennett, the local MP was supported by Todd Muller. There was no apology from Bennett, nor any explanation on why the change in guest speaker had been made.  
Now Muller is a probably a pleasant enough guy, and it may not be entirely his fault that he is the Nats spokesman on climate change. But that was very much the focus of the meeting. 



Muller is obviously a climate change disciple. He said words to the effect that it is real and had to be dealt with. And that rather than turning their backs on the issue, **the Nats had to get in bed with the international community, and the government,** and come up with an agreed combined strategy. He didn’t say that there was an emergency, but he made it quite clear that in his mind **the science was settled.**



After his address they did allow a few questions from the floor; these were all around this topic. After perhaps half a dozen questions the meeting was drawn to close.  
I did not get to make my point re freedom of speech, nor ask what they thought of the recent Australian election when a lot of the climate change matters were rejected by their electorate.



We were invited to stay and chat with both the local MP and Muller, but I figured that I had already lost 90 minutes or so of my life that I was never going to get back.  
I have the feeling that I am not walking away from the National Party; rather the National Party is walking away from me. Or perhaps I should say they are running away from me.

"Are you feeling inspired from watching the Chelsea Flower Show? Do you long for an immaculate, well-designed garden, full of well-behaved plants, brimming with colourful flowers and attractive foliage? The problem is that the gardens and flowers on show at Chelsea require a great deal of maintenance, a regular application of fertilisers and liberal use of herbicides and pesticides to keep hungry bugs and weeds at bay.  But there is an alternative option. If you want a low-maintenance, natural ecosystem, then look no further for cultivating a garden that’s good for you and your family. Growing a wild flower meadow in your garden is one option for keeping things really natural and low maintenance, but still very beautiful. Planting perennial wild flowers will bring year-on-year returns. Beware though, they prefer to grow on poorer soils just because this reduces grass growth, which otherwise tends to out-compete the flowers. You can of course reduce your soil nutrition by removing the top soil first before planting, but another option is to grow wildflower annuals which can be planted into richer soil. It is best to avoid collecting seeds from plants growing in the wild as this can seriously deplete the natural seed bank. Since the 1930s the prevalence of wild flower meadows has diminished alarmingly down to only 2% of their former levels. Instead it is recommended that you find a good wild flower seed supplier who can advise you on the best seed mix for the conditions in your area. Native species will better self-seed and support the regeneration of wild flowers. Sometimes we don’t get along with our neighbours and long to move to an environment where we can happily abide in peace. Well there’s evidence to show that some plants may feel the same, as there are species that send out toxic chemicals which inhibit the development of surrounding plants, a process called allelopathy.  Black walnut trees, for example, do this by producing their own chemical herbicide, juglone. It is excreted from the tree’s roots into the surrounding soil, which can then cause wilting and yellowing of nearby plant leaves and may even eventually kill its neighbours. Certain species such as cabbages, tomatoes, potatoes and apple and yew trees are particularly sensitive to juglone, which means you should avoid planting them near black walnut trees.  But some plant species seem to actually encourage the growth of other plants. Pea family plants, for example, improve the soil around them through the rhizobium bacteria they have in their roots. This bacteria converts atmospheric nitrogen into an absorbable form, benefiting the growth of surrounding plants.  Some plants can also be beneficial to neighbouring plants by repelling harmful insects. For example, when you plant onions with carrots, this inhibits carrot flies; or plant french beans with cabbages, the beans deter aphids. Cultivating these plants is known as companion planting and if you want your garden to flourish, neighbourly plants are the ones you want to go for. Scientists have also been exploring signals given off by plants, with research demonstrating that certain species, when attacked by pests, produce odours to repel them or attract other insects that naturally deter their pests. The cabbage family of plants frequently produce a pungent mustard-smelling chemical called isothiocyanate, which repels certain types of aphid. Some plants also release an aromatic chemical called myrtenal that has a similar insect-repelling function. Myrtenal smells a bit like pine trees, but is found in aromatic plants such as thyme, mint, rosemary and sage. By growing these herbs in your garden, besides providing you with excellent ingredients for the kitchen, you’ll have natural pest inhibitors. Wildflowers are also useful for their role as pollinator plants as they help to support declining bee populations. Many cultivated plant varieties have defective pollen and nectar producing organs and may have multiple petals that block pollinator entry, which is bad for the ecosystem. Don’t think of bees as pests in your garden, rather sit back and watch these pollinators at work. You’ll observe some fascinating behaviour in the way they stimulate the pollen chambers of difference flowers to enhance pollen release – a process called buzz pollination or sonication.  It is a process young bees and bumblebees have to learn, as they need to clasp the pollen organs and then rapidly move their wing muscles to produce a vibration that is significantly higher and louder in frequency than that used for flight. When the right vibration is created this stimulates the release of pollen. Certain flowering species are particular geared for buzz pollination, such as potato and tomato flowers. Cultivating a natural garden is not only good for the environment, but a relaxed and low-maintenance way of gardening. Plus, as it grows and develops day-by-day, you will have more time to sit and enjoy watching and learning from the fascinating workings of nature around you."

Mike Mann thinks this is cool.

In case you don’t know, SUNY’s Professor Scott Mandia is the guy running Mike Mann’s legal defense fund.
My only question is, why does he need hip wader boots?


From Scott Mandia’s blog he captions this photo: The Caped Climate Crusader: Battling the evil forces of global warming deniers. “Faster than global T rise, more powerful than a stranded polar bear, able to leap over rising seas in a single bound.”
If he can leap over rising seas, why the hip waders? Must be for wading through something deep, but what could it be?
I’m sure our readers can help correct this caption.

"**Teachers have warned of**a ""collapse"" in secondary school attendance **after the second wave of the pandemic spread across the UK during autumn.**
Relatively few pupils have tested positive, but hundreds of thousands have had to learn from home after being required to self-isolate.
What impact is that having on schools, parents and pupils themselves, as many prepare for exams?
Even before mid-October, when Northern Ireland's ""huge wave"" of cases came to Lisneal College in Londonderry, principal Michael Allen says about five of the GCSE year group of 135 pupils had not returned because of mental health and anxiety issues.
He says the impact of self-isolation was to reduce overall attendance to below 85%. At that level, for an individual student, the school would normally refer families to education welfare services, Mr Allen says.
The first case meant 60 pupils in year 12 - Northern Ireland's GCSE exam year - had to go into self-isolation, just weeks before exams started in November.
""We have just had 20 Year 12s return from two weeks of self-isolation, and at 9.30am many of those young people had to walk into an exam hall and sit a single-award GCSE chemistry exam,"" Mr Allen said.
There is ""total and utter disregard"" for the disadvantage pupils like this face in the exam system, he says, with pupils with special education needs being especially badly affected.
Remote teaching is made harder because teachers cannot work simultaneously with pupils in the classroom and those working at home. ""That's not living in the real world,"" Mr Allen said.
The work of contact tracing falls to school leaders themselves, meaning they have to respond to sudden alerts of positive cases at any time.
Mr Allen said pupils give him or his vice-principal a ""look of dread"" when they walk into the classroom, because they know it means someone will end up missing school. Some have begged them to review the contact tracing process.
""Two weeks ago we had a girl in tears asking us to go back and measure the two metres. No one seems to be taking any notice of what these young people are going through.""
""It's been a bit of a nightmare"", said Emily Proffitt of the asymptomatic spread that forced her to temporarily close Cooper Perry Primary School in Staffordshire on the advice of public health officials.
First, a staff member tested positive over half-term, forcing a few others to self-isolate. Then a few days later another member of the team tested positive.
But there was no traceable connection to other positive cases, so public health authorities said all the staff at the small village school - which has open-plan teaching spaces - needed to be tested.
That eventually uncovered another three asymptomatic cases. By that point so many staff had to self-isolate that the school was forced to close for a week.
They reopened this week, only for a pupil to test positive, meaning two year groups and five members of staff were sent home.
""For the parents, I feel so sorry for them,"" Ms Proffitt said. With several pupils having had four weeks out of school since half-term, some of their parents will have had to take time off work. For some of them, they will have been unpaid.
She said she was worried it looked like the school had not prepared for the risk, when in reality ""we've got hands that are red-raw from sanitising"".
Pupils are anxious, with some asking to wear masks even when they are not required. Staff are working in isolation from each other and are stressed, as many prepare two sets of lessons for in-person and remote teaching, Ms Proffitt said.
""We're looking at probably a decade of attachment and trauma issues that are going to be related back to Covid.""
""However much we paint our smiles on in the classroom, and we're good at that, children read us very well and they know things aren't quite right.""
Merseyside has been one of the areas worst-hit in the UK's second wave of the pandemic.
And at The Prescot School in Knowsley that has meant a collective 700 days in the classroom lost for the year 11 students preparing for exams in the summer.
One student, Ben, told the BBC: ""Year 11 is such a crucial year, you've got exams and mock exams and that's the main thing that's going to set you for life.
""As someone who's self-isolated already, I think it's really stressful to even think about the exams that we've got to do in a few months' time when we've missed out a large chunk of school.""
He says the year group is still learning content that they had missed when schools were closed in the first lockdown.
""In any other time period we would be revising and going over past things now.""
""I don't really think it's fair,"" he said, pointing out that some areas have seen much more disruption to education in this wave of the virus, while everyone will face the same exam conditions.
""We've obviously all gone through Covid and it's been strange for everyone. But there are other places it hasn't affected as much as here,"" he says.
Felicity Sandford said her daughter Cerys was the only one in her form to be sent home after contact with another child in her Spanish class who had tested positive.
""She was a bit traumatised to be pulled out of her class and not know what was going on, and she was the only one,"" Felicity said.
Students were reassured they had not done anything wrong but had to wait a while before they learned why they were being taken out of class. ""I had to go and meet her and she was pretty upset.""
Felicity said she was ""absolutely gutted"" herself as her work as a marketing consultant for children's activity providers in west London was hitting a busy time.
But she says it was a ""pleasant surprise"" how organised the remote learning has been, with Cerys using Microsoft Teams to keep in touch, taking online lessons from Oak National Academy and logging her homework and progress with photographs.
""In lockdown, at primary school there wasn't any structure. With this one I haven't had to get very involved,"" Felicity says.
The strict remote learning regime surprised Cerys too, who had hoped ""she might just get to chill out in her pyjamas"" only to find that her schedule of work had been emailed the night before.
But with both parents working from home, finding space in the house has been one of the main challenges. ""I've actually been working from her bedroom today while she's been at the dining table,"" says Felicity.
Tasos Konidaris says his daughter Mathilde took it ""quite heavily"" when she was told by her school she needed to self-isolate because of contact with a student who tested positive.
A year 11 student, Mathilde already felt unprepared because of missed classes during the pandemic's first wave, Tasos says. ""She thinks, how am I going to deal with this? Is it fair?""
He says the school adapted well to online classes with students able to watch most lessons remotely.
But eventually the whole year had to isolate as the case load became too great.
And when his daughter tested positive, the family had to self-isolate too.
With sons Hector, 13, and Alexander, 10, also learning from home, it put the parents under extra strain. ""You're having to suddenly be a parent, a teacher and do your work. It's quite wearing,"" he said.
But Tasos said it gave them a renewed appreciation of what teachers do.
""When you have your kids looking you in the eye and telling you with a sad face, I want to go back to school - which is funny to hear from a teenager - it's a tell-tale sign about how important it is."""

Continued Bias Reporting On The Climate System By Tom Karl and Peter Thorne
By Dr. Roger Pielke Sr.
Today, there were news articles concerning the state of the climate system; e.g. see  the Associated Press news release in the Washington Post
Climate change study: More than 300 months since the planets temperature was below average
The news article refers to the 2010 climate summary that will be published in a Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society article. The article will undoubtedly include informative information on the climate.
However, the news article itself erroneously reports on the actual state of the climate, as can easily be shown simply by extracting current analyses from the web.  Two of the prominent individuals quoted in the news report are Tom Karl and Peter Thorne. They make the following claims

“The indicators show unequivocally that the world continues to warm,” Thomas R. Karl, director of the National Climatic Data Center, said in releasing the annual State of the Climate report for 2010.”
“There is a clear and unmistakable signal from the top of the atmosphere to the depths of the oceans,” added Peter Thorne of the Cooperative Institute for Climate and Satellites, North Carolina State University.”
“Carbon dioxide increased by 2.60 parts per million in the atmosphere in 2010, which is more than the average annual increase seen from 1980-2010, Karl added. Carbon dioxide is the major greenhouse gas accumulating in the air that atmospheric scientists blame for warming the climate.”
Karl is correct on the increase in carbon dioxide, but, otherwise,  he and Peter Thorne are not honestly presenting  the actual state of the climate system.  They focus on the surface temperature data, which as, we have reported on in peer-reviewed papers, has major unresolved uncertainties and includes a systematic warm bias; e.g. see
Pielke Sr., R.A., C. Davey, D. Niyogi, S. Fall, J. Steinweg-Woods, K. Hubbard, X. Lin, M. Cai, Y.-K. Lim, H. Li, J. Nielsen-Gammon, K. Gallo, R. Hale, R. Mahmood, S. Foster, R.T. McNider, and P. Blanken, 2007: Unresolved issues with the assessment of multi-decadal global land surface temperature trends. J. Geophys. Res., 112, D24S08, doi:10.1029/2006JD008229.
Klotzbach, P.J., R.A. Pielke Sr., R.A. Pielke Jr., J.R. Christy, and R.T. McNider, 2009: An alternative explanation for differential temperature trends at the surface and in the lower troposphere. J. Geophys. Res., 114, D21102, doi:10.1029/2009JD011841.
The climate system has not warmed since about 2003 either in the upper ocean or in the lower troposphere as shown in the three figures below.
Tom Karl is wrong in his first quote  – The indicators DO NOT show unequivocally that the world continues to warm. This warming has stalled, at least for now, since about 2003. Peter Thorne is misrepresenting the actual data when he erroneously reports that (assuming he means ‘unequivocal warming’)  “There is a clear and unmistakable signal from the top of the atmosphere to the depths of the oceans”.

Second, the lower troposphere (from both the RSS and UAH MSU data)  also do NOT SHOW unequivocally that the world continues to warm! Indeed, warming has also stalled since about 2002.

Figure caption: Global  average (70 south to 82.5 north) lower tropospheric temperatures (from RSS)

Figure caption: Global  average (70 south to 82.5 north) lower tropospheric temperatures (from UAH)
It should not be surprising that Tom Karl and Peter Thorne are not honestly reporting the actual state of the climate system, which involves a much more complex signal in response to human and natural climate forcings and feedbacks, than they report on; e.g. see
Christy, J.R., B. Herman, R. Pielke, Sr., P. Klotzbach, R.T. McNider, J.J. Hnilo, R.W. Spencer, T. Chase and D. Douglass, 2010: What do observational datasets say about modeled tropospheric temperature trends since 1979?  Remote Sensing, 2(9), 2148-2169.
Previous documentation of the biases and efforts to manage the information provided to policymakers by Tom Karl and Peter Thorne includes the following examples
Pielke Sr., Roger A., 2005: Public Comment on CCSP Report “Temperature Trends in the Lower Atmosphere: Steps for Understanding and Reconciling Differences“. 88 pp including appendices
The Selective Bias Of NOAA’s National Climate Data Center (NCDC) With Respect To The Analysis And Interpretation Of Multi-Decadal Land Surface Temperature Trends Under The Leadership Of Tom Karl and Tom Peterson
Erroneous Climate Science Statement By Tom Karl, Director Of The National Climate Data Center And President Of The American Meteorological Society
E-mail Documentation Of The Successful Attempt By Thomas Karl Director Of the U.S. National Climate Data Center To Suppress Biases and Uncertainties In the Assessment Of Surface Temperature Trends
Erroneous Statement By Peter A. Stott And Peter W. Thorne In Nature Titled “How Best To Log Local Temperatures?”
It is disappointing that the media do not properly question the claims made by Tom Karl and Peter Thorne. They are presenting a biased report on the actual state of the climate system.

Possibly many Oilers shared my opinion that Todd Muller, MP for Western Bay of Plenty and National Party Climate Change spokesman, was attempting to steer a balanced course and soften the excesses of James Shaw et al. He appeared, in speeches in the house, to be agreeing with cuts while warning against getting ahead of the rest of the world with excessive cuts and aggressive pain to the economy. 



Wonder no more. Todd is swimming in the Koolaid while singing “ _I’m a Believer_ “.



I have always had a lot of respect for Todd, my local MP, as a person. He is a thoroughly nice bloke and a great electorate MP. However his latest utterance has blown it.



 **Wibble** was out of the blocks smartly with a comment about a ‘consensus’ that Todd and National might not find quite as acceptable:



Dear Todd, thanks for confirming that you do not believe in science in any way, shape or form, and that you instead believe that decisions should be made based upon subjective opinions and political “consensus” rather than objective fact. There is no such thing as “consensus” in science Todd, and anyone who says that there is, has just proven that they are not, by definition, a scientist. Perhaps you have read a little too much from the great “Scientists” like Al Gore, Barack Obama and Greta Thunberg.



Since you seem to be so happy with the “consensus” that you already have on climate change Todd, then you will be glad to know that traditional National Party voters will not be so cruel as to overburden you with yet another “consensus” of votes in the upcoming election. Clearly one consensus is already beyond your understanding. As a past National Party voter, Au Revoir Todd.



 **Cadae** suggested Todd really read the IPCC reports, not just the soundbites for politicans.



Todd needs to read the real science sections of the IPCC AR reports – not the bureaucracy-created and politically driven summaries that have misled him. In the science sections he will find plenty of hedging statements about the soundness of the models and their future ‘projections’. Note especially the clearly documented lack of understanding of the impact of and the ability to model clouds. Clouds have a significant impact on temperatures and precipitation.



**Blueburd** challenged Todd to prove it to us all:



Hey Todd, show us the absolute proof that MMCC is real and happening. To date every prediction made about CC let alone MMCC has been wrong. The polar caps are still in place, there is still sea ice and snow continues to fall. All of those were predicted to not exist anymore.



I suggest you join the real world, and realise that looking after our environment and reducing pollution in our own neck of the woods will be far more beneficial than giving $1.4b a year to an unknown entity



 **Doug Longmire** was another one not buying ‘consensus:



Science is research, data, double blind studies, evidence, critical evaluation of an hypothesis.   
Science is NOT “consensus” . Politics is consensus.  
Every medical or science student knows this.

"“Transformative change” is needed to prevent a million species going extinct, according to a new report on the world’s biodiversity. Based on information gathered over three years from land, freshwater and marine ecosystems, and drawing heavily from the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, the report from the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services warns that Earth’s life-support systems may collapse if humanity doesn’t change the way it values and uses nature. But what does this mean for everyday life? “Biodiversity” – which describes the variety and abundance of species living on Earth – is a term which doesn’t travel far outside debate between scientists and policymakers. The consequences of the biodiversity crisis can seem abstract and difficult for many people to understand, particularly the implications for their own lives. Think food, though, and the implications become clear. Modern livestock breeds and crop species have been bred to be highly productive, which means accentuating particular traits. Chickens have been bred to maintain a uniform size for cost effective production, while fruit and vegetables have been bred to have thick, juicy flesh. To concentrate these features within livestock and crop populations, plants and animals are bred with ever more genetically similar partners, leaving a shallow and homogeneous gene pool that is a poor defence against disease and environmental change. Wild relatives of domesticated plants and animals are the ancestral species from which crops and livestock have descended, or their near relatives. The pigs we raise for food are descended from wild boar (Sus scrofa) and chickens are descended from red jungle fowl (Gallus gallus) – a species that is widespread in Asia. These wild species are thought to be sufficiently closely related to domestic varieties that they could crossbreed to increase their genetic diversity. The wild relatives of domesticated species inhabit the rocky and icebound fastness of high mountain ranges, dense tropical forests and arid deserts. They’ve continued to evolve under natural conditions and so might contain genes that will help food species fight diseases and remain productive in a changing environment. Genetic diversity helps species survive long into the future, by increasing the likelihood that individuals will have helpful genetic quirks, such as immunity to a new disease.  As climate change makes some growing regions hotter and drier, wild relatives of corn that are drought-resistant could be crossbred with farmed varieties to make them more resilient. As new pathogens emerge, wild relatives of cows could crossbreed with cattle to bolster the immune defences encoded in their DNA. These ancestral species and wild relatives are however, not all as common as junglefowl or wild boar. A worryingly large number are little known and highly threatened, or even on the verge of extinction. Baer’s pochard (Aythya baeri) is a critically endangered duck species from South East-Asia that is closely related to the mallard, from which the domestic duck is derived. The Kouprey (Bos sauveli) from central Vietnam is a wild relative of the cow and may even be extinct in the wild. Humans are relying on a narrowing base of species for food, using more and more commercially-bred livestock and crops while losing the wild relatives – the reservoir of genetic diversity. These genetic resources may become increasingly important for feeding some nine billion people by 2050, in a world shaped by climate change and all the knock-on effects this will have for agriculture.   The status of wild relatives is, overall, worse than for birds and mammals generally. Whereas 25% of all mammal species are considered threatened with extinction, more than half of mammals that are wild relatives of domesticated mammals are threatened. The figures for birds, while overall less threatened, show a similar pattern. Some 13% of all birds are threatened, compared with 31% of birds which are wild relatives of domesticated species like chickens and turkeys.  It’s perhaps unsurprising given that these species, like their intensively farmed relatives, are large-bodied and so once caught or killed provide a good source of nourishing food. That’s certainly the case for Edwards’s pheasant (Lophura edwardsi) – a critically endangered species which belongs to the same subfamily as chickens, native to South East-Asia and widely snared. A further 30 species are considered endangered, such as the Lowland Anoa (Bubalus depressicornis), a close relative of the river buffalo and native to Indonesia. Losing these wild relatives of domesticated animals seriously threatens the resilience of our food systems, by leaving crops and livestock genetically poorer. The IPBES report highlights this threat. Countries will agree targets for protecting biodiversity in 2020 and the wild relatives of domesticated species should be chief among them. We really do need a transformation in our relationship with nature, and this will have to include serious change in our diets and how food is produced. We will need wild relatives of important food species to ensure that genetic diversity can enhance food security in an increasingly uncertain future."

Some cheerful news on the climate change front today, as US  government boffins report that ice breaking off the Antarctic shelves  and melting in the sea causes carbon dioxide to be removed from the  environment. This powerful, previously unknown “negative feedback” would  seem likely to revise forecasts of future global warming significantly  downwards.


“These new findings… confirm that icebergs contribute yet another,  previously unsuspected, dimension of physical and biological complexity  to polar ecosystems,” says Roberta Marinelli, director of the NSF’s  Antarctic Organisms and Ecosystems Program.
Full story here Also, from the National Science Foundation, a potential negative feedback as icebergs boost phytoplankton, removing more CO2 during the process.

Antarctic Icebergs Play a Previously Unknown Role in Global Carbon Cycle, Climate

Passage of icebergs through surface waters changes their physical and biological characteristics
In a finding that has global implications for climate  research, scientists have discovered that when icebergs cool and dilute  the seas through which they pass for days, they also raise chlorophyll  levels in the water that may in turn increase carbon dioxide absorption  in the Southern Ocean.

An interdisciplinary research team  supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) highlighted the  research this month in the journal Nature Geosciences.
The  research indicates that “iceberg transport and melting have a role in  the distribution of phytoplankton in the Weddell Sea,” which was  previously unsuspected, said John J. Helly, director of the Laboratory  for Environmental and Earth Sciences with the San Diego Supercomputer  Center at the University of California, San Diego and Scripps  Institution of Oceanography.
Helly was the lead author of the  paper, “Cooling, Dilution and Mixing of Ocean Water by Free-drifting  Icebergs in the Weddell Sea,” which was first published in the journal Deep-Sea Research Part II.
The  results indicate that icebergs are especially likely to influence  phytoplankton dynamics in an area known as “Iceberg Alley,” east of the  Antarctic Peninsula, the portion of the continent that extends  northwards toward Chile.
The latest findings add a new dimension  to previous research by the same team that altered the perception of  icebergs as large, familiar, but passive, elements of the Antarctic  seascape. The team previously showed that icebergs act, in effect, as  ocean “oases” of nutrients for aquatic life and sea birds.
The  teams’s research indicates that ordinary icebergs are likely to become  more prevalent in the Southern Ocean, particularly as the Antarctic  Peninsula continues a well-documented warming trend and ice shelves  disintegrate. Research also shows that these ordinary icebergs are  important features of not only marine ecosystems, but even of global  carbon cycling.
“These new findings amplify the team’s previous  discoveries about icebergs and confirm that icebergs contribute yet  another, previously unsuspected, dimension of physical and biological  complexity to polar ecosystems,” said Roberta L. Marinelli, director of  the NSF’s Antarctic Organisms and Ecosystems Program.
NSF manages  the U.S. Antarctic Program, through which it coordinates all U.S.  scientific research and related logistics on the southernmost continent  and aboard ships in the Southern Ocean.
The latest findings  document a persistent change in physical and biological characteristics  of surface waters after the transit of an iceberg, which has important  effects on phytoplankton populations, clearly demonstrating “that  icebergs influence oceanic surface waters and mixing to greater extents  than previously realized,” said Ronald S. Kaufmann, associate professor  of marine science and environmental studies at the University of San  Diego and one of the authors of the paper.
The researchers studied  the effects by sampling the area around a large iceberg more than 32  kilometers (20 miles) long; the same area was surveyed again ten days  later, after the iceberg had drifted away.
After ten days, the scientists observed increased concentrations of chlorophyll a and reduced concentrations of carbon dioxide, as compared to nearby  areas without icebergs. These results are consistent with the growth of  phytoplankton and the removal of carbon dioxide from the ocean.
The  new results demonstrate that icebergs provide a connection between the  geophysical and biological domains that directly affects the carbon  cycle in the Southern Ocean, Marinelli added.
In 2007, the same team published findings in the journal Science that icebergs serve as “hotspots” for ocean life with thriving  communities of seabirds above and a web of phytoplankton, krill and fish  below. At that time, the researchers reported that icebergs hold  trapped terrestrial material, which they release far out at sea as they  melt, a process that produces a “halo effect” with significantly  increased nutrients and krill out to a radius of more than three  kilometers (two miles).
The new research was conducted as part of a  multi-disciplinary project that also involved scientists from the  Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, University of South Carolina,  University of Nevada, Reno, University of South Carolina, Brigham Young  University, and the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences.
Scripps  Institution of Oceanography research biologist Maria Vernet and  graduate student Gordon Stephenson also contributed to the paper.

"As each of us languishes in isolation, one man is about to enter the Guinness Book of World Records for being on his own. When the next edition of every aspirant child’s bible comes out later this year, Richard Parks will be included for skiing more miles (2,299) in Antarctica, solo, unassisted and unsupported, than anyone else. If geographical isolation is the measure, no one has been lonelier. And yet over the phone in our new reality he can be heard handling the demands of his two-year-old son, Freddie, with aplomb, even as he handles those of this interviewer on the other end of the line.  “Speaking frankly,” he says, when asked whether isolation is easier with wife and child in a flat in Cardiff Bay or on his own in the sprawling, frozen wilderness, “there are pros and cons. Every moment of every expedition I wish I was able to share it with my family and friends. It seems this cruel twist of fate has now landed us with exactly that wish. Managing the space together poses its own challenges. The other day I found Jo, who holds a pretty senior position, working in Freddie’s treehouse on the balcony in the flat.” Parks’s relationship with isolation is long and poignant. Forged in the boisterous rough and tumble of professional rugby, he was plunged into turmoil when his career, which included four caps for Wales, was cut short by a shoulder injury in 2009. In his award-winning autobiography, Beyond the Horizon, he describes how he retreated into the bare, white room at the back of the house his parents were renting. Crippled by despair and fear, he holed up for 21 days, emerging from the room only for the toilet and, from the house, for an operation on his ruined shoulder. “That first period of isolation was really painful,” he says. “I felt at sea with nothing to hold on to. I was completely powerless – over my emotions, over what had happened, the injury. That was terrifying, right. I can imagine there might be people going through feelings related to that now.” A line from his grandmother’s funeral two years earlier – “the horizon is only the limit of our sight” – had resonated so deeply he had it tattooed on his forearm. While staring at it in that white room, he was struck by an epiphany. His horizons had closed in, but thenceforth he would embrace the brilliant whiteness of mountains, wildernesses and the unknown, where the horizon stretches farther than anywhere else on earth. He launched himself into his new vocation, acquiring the skills of a mountaineer with remarkable facility. In 2011, he became the first to stand, in the same calendar year, at the highest peak of each of the seven continents and at the North and South Pole, known as the adventurers’ grand slam. He managed the feat in six and a half months. Since then, he has raised hundreds of thousands of pounds for charity and worked with scientists as a kind of guinea pig at the extremes of human endeavour. But his current world record is not the one he had been seeking in his four expeditions to Antarctica, the first a training run in late 2012. Parks has been chasing a world record they say will never be broken. In 2011, his friend Christian Eide of Norway skied the 715 miles from Hercules Inlet on the coast of Antarctica to the South Pole in an astonishing 24 days, smashing the previous record of 39. The reason no one expects it to be broken is that the conditions were perfect throughout. Good weather is not something to rely upon in Antarctica, the driest, windiest and coldest continent. Parks, in that sunny Antarctic summer of 2011, was on the first two legs of his adventurer’s grand slam and testifies the weather has deteriorated since, becoming snowier, wetter and warmer. Despite the conditions, in 2014, he became the second-fastest skier to the South Pole, in a time of 29 days. The magnitude of the challenge beggars belief. A month’s worth of supplies and equipment must be hauled on a sled weighing roughly 70kg, as the challenger skis uphill from the coast to the Antarctic plateau, 3,000m above sea level, the height of an average Alp. Parks expended the calorific equivalent of two marathons a day in the most hostile environment on earth. Forced to abandon his second record attempt last year, because of even worse weather than usual, this year he skied for 16 hours a day, and slept for three, as he lowered his British record to 28 days in January. At halfway he was on course to break Eide’s world record. Then, sure enough, the weather turned, the wind howling at him from the pole with a chill factor of -45 degrees. By the time he finished, he had lost 14.5kg. “I’m genuinely at peace with it,” he says of the knowledge the speed record seems out of reach in the current climate. “There are some things I can’t control. That’s what makes this different from mainstream sport. And there’s a beauty in that.” He has not decided whether to try again. For now, the kind of isolation we are all wrestling with is preoccupying him more. “For any given expedition, there is years of preparation and training. With the current situation, we didn’t have that luxury. So we are all going through something akin to the grief curve.” Identifying and honouring what he can and cannot control is Parks’s mantra. Through it, he has transformed isolation from the scourge of his very soul to the field in which he is now a world-record holder."
"The environmental impact of palm oil production has been well publicised. Found in everything from food to cosmetics, the deforestation, ecosystem decline and biodiversity loss associated with its use is a serious cause for concern.  What many people may not know, however, is that oil palm trees – the fruit of which is used to create palm oil – have a limited commercial lifespan of 25 years. Once this period has ended, the plantation is cut down and replanted, as older trees start to become less productive and are difficult to harvest. Our research has now found that this replanting might be causing a second wave of biodiversity loss, further damaging the environment where these plantations have been created. An often overlooked fact is that oil palm plantations actually have higher levels of biodiversity compared to some other crops. More species of forest butterflies would be lost if a forest were converted to a rubber plantation, than if it were converted to oil palm, for example. One reason for this is that oil palm plantations provide a habitat that is more similar to tropical forest than other forms of agriculture (such as soybean production). The vegetation growing beneath the oil palm canopy (called understory vegetation) also provides food and a habitat for many different species, allowing them to thrive. Lizard abundance typically increases when primary forests are converted to oil palm, for example.

      Palm oil boycott could actually increase deforestation – sustainable products are the solution


 This does not mean oil palm plantations are good for the environment. In South-East Asia, where 85% of palm oil is produced, the conversion of forest to oil palm plantations has caused declines in the number of several charismatic animals, including orangutans, sun bears and hornbills. Globally, palm oil production affects at least 193 threatened species, and further expansion could affect 54% of threatened mammals and 64% of threatened birds. Banning palm oil would likely only displace, not halt this biodiversity loss. Several large brands and retailers are already producing products using sustainably certified palm oil, as consumers reassess the impact of their purchasing. But as it is such an ubiquitous ingredient, if it were outlawed companies would need an alternative to keep producing products which include it, and developing countries would need to find something else to contribute to their economies. Production would shift to the cultivation of other oil crops elsewhere, such as rapeseed, sunflower or soybean, in order to meet global demand. In fact, since oil palm produces the highest yields per hectare – up to nine times more oil than any other vegetable oil crop – it could be argued that cultivating oil palm minimises deforestation.  That’s not to say further deforestation should be encouraged to create plantations though. It is preferable to replace plantations in situ, replanting each site so that land already allocated for palm oil production can be reused. This replanting is no small undertaking – 13m hectares of palm oil plantations are to be uprooted by the year 2030, an area nearly twice the size of Scotland. However, our study reveals that much more needs to be done in the management and processes around this replanting, in order to maximise productivity and protect biodiversity in plantations.

      Palm oil: scourge of the earth, or wonder crop?


 We found significant declines in the biodiversity and abundance of soil organisms as a consequence of palm replanting. While there was some recovery over the seven years it takes the new crop to establish, the samples we took still had nearly 20% less diversity of invertebrates (such as ants, earthworms, millipedes and spiders) than oil palm converted directly from forest.  We also found that second-wave mature oil palm trees had 59% fewer animals than the previous crop. This drastic change could have severe repercussions for soil health and the overall agro-ecosystem sustainability. Without healthy, well-functioning soil, crop production suffers. It is likely that replanting drives these declines. Prior to replanting, heavy machinery is used to uproot old palms. This severely disrupts the soil, making upper layers vulnerable to erosion and compaction, reducing its capacity to hold water. This is likely to have a negative impact on biodiversity, which is then further reduced due to the heavy use of pesticides.

      How Indonesia's election puts global biodiversity at stake with an impending war on palm oil


 Without change to these management practices, soil degradation is likely to continue, causing decreases in future biodiversity, as well as the productivity of the plantation. Ultimately, palm oil appears to be a necessary food product for growing populations. However, now that we have identified some of the detrimental consequences of replanting practices, it is clear that long-term production of palm oil comes at a higher cost than previously thought. The world needs to push for more sustainable palm oil, and those in the industry must explore more biodiversity-friendly replanting practices in order to lessen the long-term impacts of intensive oil palm cultivation."

Presumably when your business model depends upon people being stupid enough to think that they can beat the house at a gambling table or pokie machine then anything goes.



SkyCity hotels are introducing a different kind of bible to its rooms – a book on climate change.



The revelation was announced at a Climate Leaders Coalition meeting last night, when SkyCity chief executive Graeme Stephens said they were adding a new Gideons Bible to their rooms.



When asked about it on stage, Stephens said: “I hope I’m not being offensive. But I’m introducing a new Gideons Bible to our hotel rooms in the form of books on climate change.”



He said he had asked Meridian head Neal Barclay for advice about it.



“I said to him: ‘I want a book that I can understand, that actually points to what I can do today, not some sort of **nebula** [sic] scientific concept’.”



The practice of keeping a Bible in hotel rooms started in the late 19th century when three men who founded Gideons International in the 1800s spread the good news by distributing Bibles in hotel rooms.



Stephens received the climate change book – Drawdown – the next day.



 **“It’s a great book because it’s got lots of pictures.** […]



  
Really? So did my earliest childhood books!



I wonder what the Gideons organisation feels about this book being called a “new Gideons Bible”?



And what is a ‘nebula’? Let’s ask NASA:



A **nebula** is a giant cloud of dust and gas in space. Some nebulae (more than one nebula) come from the gas and dust thrown out by the explosion of a dying star, such as a supernova. Other nebulae are regions where new stars are beginning to form.



  
It would appear that SkyCity chief executive Graeme Stephens skipped science lessons. Presumably, that is why a nonsense book with lots of pictures appeals.



Let’s read a few reviews of _Drawdown_ from Amazon. 



The author knew darn well that the topic is of great importance, so he set out to write 3 page excepts on 90 shallow ideas. i tried to finish the book, but **it was too stupid, too shallow and too amateurish** to waste my time getting to the end. I quit about 70% of the way through, and I almost never quit a book….. **complete trash, not helpful** , the author took advantage of the fact so many people are eager to learn the truth about renewable energy possibilities and **he managed to publish nonsense**.



  
Many chapters give estimates of dollar and carbon savings for different climate interventions. **I could not find any methodology for the calculations or references to them.** Though this book many describe all the topics under the umbrella of climate change, those looking for references to original sources will encounter problems.



  
I bought this book with a genuine interest in the different proposals on how to tackle global warming, and after reading about half of it I gave it up. **This is more left wing propaganda than it is an objective view on climate and potential solutions.** […]



  
Clearly I have picked these reviews as there was glowing support from the believers, however, even the top positive review was still critical.



Drawdown is long overdue. As with all of Hawken’s writings it’s well conceived, carefully researched and beautifully written. Thank goodness for this effort. Yet….



 **I looked in vain for the evidence** that the remedies discussed will materially change the trajectory of projected temperature increases. How much below 2 C will we stabilize at with full implementation of these 100 remedies? According to the book even the most aggressive scenario they model only reduces CO2 by less than one gigaton (out of about 40 gigatons we spew each year) and that isn’t until 2045. That means that we’re still doomed.



  
Perhaps a handbook on dealing with problem gambling would be of more use to the guests and society in general than this new “Bible”?

"Bumblebees are among the intellectual giants of the insect world. They learn the locations of landmarks relative to their nest, and are able to navigate accurately many miles across the landscape. They quickly learn which flowers are the most rewarding, and how best to collect the rewards swiftly, using the least energy. They even use the faint smell of previous bee visitors to tell them which flowers are likely to have been emptied, and avoid them in favour of those with a full tank.  Bumblebees communicate through pheromones, which the queen uses to communicate within the nest, and through sounds caused by their wings, which workers can use to recruit more foragers and to signal danger. They can even learn by watching each other which flowers are the most rewarding. They are amazing and important creatures, for they pollinate numerous wildflowers and many crops such as tomatoes, strawberries, raspberries and runner beans. "

Share this...FacebookTwitterRecord snow and cold Arctic air have blasted across Central Europe this weekend. FOCUS magazine here for example writes that up to 15 cm of snow blanketed parts of Germany, wreaking havoc on travel. Hat tip DirkH.
Just a week ago, Europeans were basking in near summer-like temperatures. But over the course of one week, the mercury plummeted 20°C. “That happens probably about every 30 to 40 years,“ says meteorologist Christoph Hartmann of the German Weather Service (DWD). “That happens maybe once or twice in a lifetime.”
Focus writes that for many locations “it was the first measured October snowfall”.
German public television: “Proof of rapid climate change!”
So what is to blame for the early winter outbreak this year? “Global warming,” says the German ZDF public television news anchor Claus Kleber, see here. He says:
“It’s nothing dramatic, that is until you ask the climate scientists. They say it is precisely because of global warming. When the ice at the North Pole melts away, then it doesn’t simply mean that it is going to get warmer in Europe. The relationships in climate are more complicated than that. According to the models, the rapid temperature drop of last few days is proof that our climate is rapidly changing.”
This is just stupid propaganda from charlatans, which thankfully only a few idiot ZDF listeners will believe. Most Germans are laughing at this rubbish.
So what could possibly be the source of this utter nonsense, you may ask? Answer: That source is IPCC scientist Prof. Mojib Latif of the GEOMAR Institute in Kiel (see video link above).
Now, the following video (in German) tells you everything you need to know about Latif.

The professor has one big problem: he has a huge habit of saying anything to seize the moment. As a result he has a rap sheet of public statements that directly contradict each other. He’s not truthful.
He says it’s getting warmer, then he says it’s getting cooler. He said we’d never see snowy winters again, now he says we’ll see more of them. He says natural cycles play a major role, and then turns around and says they don’t. Is this guy hopelessly confused or what!
Rainer Hoffmann at the European Institute for Climate and Energy here has put up a Youtube video (see above) with a compilation of Latif’s quotes, which I now provide in English as follows.

"Although it may seem counter-intuitive, it would be better if we built buildings from wood than from concrete, brick, aluminium and steel.  We use millions of tonnes of these modern materials every year. They have many valuable properties, but are energy-intensive to create, accounting for around 16% of the entire planets’ fossil fuel production. Instead we could be using wood, which is also strong, renewable, and plentiful – we use only a fraction of the world’s available forestry resources.  Our research, published in the Journal of Sustainable Forestry, estimated that the world’s forest contain about 385 billion cubic metres of wood, with an additional 17 billion cubic metres growing each year. A mere 3.4 billion cubic metres is harvested each year, mostly for subsistence fuel burning; the rest rots, burns in fires, or adds to forests’ density. Swapping steel, concrete, or brick for wood and specially engineered wood equivalents would drastically reduce global carbon dioxide emissions, fossil fuel consumption and would represent a renewable resource. What’s more, managed properly this can be done without loss of biodiversity or carbon storage capacity. In our study undertaken by scientists from the Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies and the University of Washington’s College of the Environment we evaluated various scenarios including leaving forests untouched, burning wood for energy and use of wood as a construction material. The 3.4 billion cubic meters of wood harvested each year accounts for only 20% of new annual growth. Increasing the wood harvest to 34% or more would have several profound and positive effects. Emissions amounting to 14-31% of global CO2 would be avoided by creating less steel and concrete, and by storing CO2 in the cell structure of wood products. A further 12-19% of annual global fossil fuel consumption would be saved, including savings from burning scrap wood and unsellable materials for energy. Building with wood consumes much less energy than using concrete or steel. For example, a wooden floor beam requires 80 megajoules (mj) of energy per square metre of floor space and emits 4kg CO2. By comparison, a square metre of floor space supported by a steel beam requires 516 mj and emits 40 kg of CO2, and a concrete slab floor requires 290 mj and emits 27kg of CO2. By using efficient harvesting and production techniques, more CO2 is saved through the avoided emissions, materials, and wood energy than is lost from the harvested forest – yet another reason to appreciate forests, and to protect them from endless deforestation for agriculture. Clearing trees for harvest is temporary, but converting forests to farmland is a permanent loss of all forest’s resources and biodiversity. If transport and assembly is taken into account, the 16% of global fossil fuels used to manufacture steel, concrete and brick is closer to 20-30%. These potential fuel and carbon emissions savings, already substantial, will become increasingly critical as demand for new buildings, bridges and other infrastructure surges with economic development in Asia, Africa and South America.  At the same time, new construction techniques have made wood even more effective as a building material for anything from bridges to mid-rise apartment buildings. The cross-laminated timber increasingly used in new buildings, made from alternating layers of perpendicular, wood pieces has strength approaching that of steel.  In 2009 a nine-storey building, Stadthaus, in London, was built with CLT instead of steel construction and in Stockholm a 34-storey wooden building has been given planning permission. There are many others, already built and in the pipeline. Harvesting also reduces a forest’s likelihood of suffering a catastrophic wildfire, and improves its ability to withstand it. Maintaining a mix of forest habitats and tree densities in non-reserved forests would help preserve the varied biodiversity in ecosystems worldwide. Harvesting wood will save fossil fuel and CO2, and provide jobs – giving local people more reason to ensure the forests’ survival."

Ever since the selection of the CoL, New Zealand’s population has suffered a blitzkrieg of the IPCC climate change farce. There is absolutely no scientific proof of this anthropogenic global warming alarmist hypothesis that calls for a “Climate Emergency”, yet we are told again and again: “the debate is over” and “the science is settled”. Because we are not allowed further debate, it means that in this case **‘science’ has become ideology.**



Prior to our Little Ice Age during the Medieval Warm Period, Vikings colonised Greenland and Newfoundland, when it was warmer than it is today. It was also warmer during Roman times, long before fossil fuels revolutionised civilisation.



We are continually told that CO2 is a “toxic pollutant” that must be curtailed **when in fact it is a colourless, odourless, tasteless gas,** present at 400 parts per million of the global atmosphere, and is the most important food for life on earth. Without CO2 above 150 parts per million, all plants would die and so would most animals on earth, including humans. 



At 400 parts per million our food crops, forests, and natural ecosystems are apparently still on a starvation diet for CO2. One wing of the scientific community promotes the IPCC “Climate Change CO2 warming” danger line. Other scientists and researchers promote the positive impact of the small increase in CO2 over the past 50 years, because apparently increased CO2 means that plants don’t need as much water, so our deserts can become lusher. 



I am not a scientist however, that sounds pretty darn good to me as we, by our very existence, have absolute and historically validated proof that CO2 is vital for life on earth and plants need CO2 for photosynthesis. Despite this we still have the doomsayers using the climate to justify a **‘war’** on CO2: to instil fear, increase taxes and control our everyday lives. 



The Greens have labelled ‘weather’ or ‘climate change’ our enemy. What a terrible, fictitious burden to indoctrinate our children with.



I say that remaining alive on the earth would be a lot more difficult without CO2, and having a little more of it could be very positive in helping us to feed the world and enhance the planet’s green ecology. 



The NZ parliament and most local councils are threatening to hobble our economy with a ‘climate emergency’. Why is this happening when much larger ­nations take a ‘pass’ by making pious pronouncements and then doing absolutely nothing?



 **When will the New Zealand people wake up and take notice**? The seriousness of needing more CO2, was most evident when **the lack of CO 2 in Europe, due to the shutdown of ammonia plants, contributed to the beer shortage** **for the 2018 European world cup celebrations**. 



Will the natural fermentation process that allows CO2 production also be taxed or perhaps even banned? Do we need to immediately call ‘ **a beer shortage emergency’?**



My ‘beer in jest analogy’ relates to the USA alcohol prohibition in the 1920s and early 30s, to exemplify how activists and politicians shifted the Overton window enough that the banning of alcohol was ‘acceptable’ to the general public. In actuality, it later turned out that very few of the public wanted their alcoholic tipple taken away. 



Today, similarly, the politicians are wanting to move the Overton window, by hysterically calling the AGW scam a **‘CRISIS’**. This enables the politicians to gain more power and garner extra tax, thereby eroding taxpayers’ rights and pushing more ‘deplorables’ into dependency on the state. 



Let’s adjust that window back to include democratic common sense.

WUWT readers may remember this story I wrote about the clowns from Old Pulteney’s “Row to the Pole” who had headlines blaring in Britain exclaiming they had rowed to the “north pole”. Telegraph, BBC, and Independent geography FAIL: “Row to the Pole” never made it to the “North Pole” – they are 790 miles short

I pointed out that not only were they NOT at the north pole, they weren’t even at the north magnetic pole which had since moved due to the Earth’s normal processes.
As I explained before the trip even started, there’s no “pole” achievement here, not even close. They are 738 KM short of the actual magnetic pole. The 1996 magnetic pole doesn’t exist there anymore and thus can’t be a pole of any kind. 

The Telegraph article says:
The successful trip to the Pole, described as the “greatest ocean rows of all time”, was only possible because of more seasonal ice-melt in the Arctic that has opened the waters up.
No mention of the fact that they aren’t even close. The actual North pole is 790 miles away:

Most any child in primary school taking an introduction to geography could spot this error, which makes the Telegraphs error doubly embarrassing.
Following my lead, WUWT reader Neil Turner issued a complaint to the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) in the UK over this glaring inaccuracy. They responded with a ruling and agreed the Telegraph erred. Here is part of the email exchange from the PCC and the Telegraph:

And here is the microscopically sized “correction” printed today on page 18, next to the nude wrestler story and the fashion news. It doesn’t even contain the word “correction”.

Neil writes in his email to me:
My observation is that it is typical that the misleading story received far greater prominence than the correction. I took this up with the PCC, and they explained that the size, font etc of correction is leaft at the Editor’s discretion.
From my perspective, the editor’s discretion, shown above in it’s placement and size, is pretty much the journalistic equivalent of “eff you!”.
What a bunch of gormless cobblers.
Meanwhile Jock Wishart and the crew enjoys the spoils of their sponsor, the Old Pulteney whisky company, caring not at all that people think he’s reached some sort of geographic pole. Such is the way of the world today, fluff and failure make headlines whiles facts get buried on page 18 next to the nude wrestlers.

"**The image of 81-year-old Stefano Bozzini playing the accordion from an Italian street below his wife's hospital window stole hearts around the world.**
Carla Sacchi was allowed out of the hospital near Piacenza a few days ago but has now died at her home.
Although she had not contracted coronavirus, hospital rules meant her husband was unable to visit her.
Piacenza Mayor Patrizia Barbieri said the disease had ""broken their embrace"".
However, in a Facebook message, she paid tribute to Mr Bozzini's gesture of ""tenderness"".
""In that serenade we all recognised love, in the simplicity and immediacy of its universal language.""
Hospital staff and residents in the town of Castel San Giovanni watched as the former member of Italy's Alpine regiment donned his Alpine hat, sat on a stool and played a succession of melodies including Spanish Eyes from the courtyard beneath his wife's window.
His son Maurizio said Stefano had asked the hospital if he could ""perform a few songs for her to give her five minutes of happiness"".
""It was a sunny day, I would have liked to play longer, for the whole day,"" Mr Bossini told the Piacenza LibertÃ newspaper.
The couple had been married for 47 years and he blew his wife a kiss as she watched from behind the window.
He recently told his local paper how he still played the accordion regularly at village festivals and nursing homes. He said everyone had asked him to play at his wedding but he pretended he had hurt his hand ""because I wanted to dance - me with her"".
Northern Italy has borne the brunt of the second wave in Italy's Covid-19 pandemic but the Emilia-Romagna region where Castel San Giovanni is located has not been hit as hard as neighbouring Lombardy.

"**England's new Covid tier system has a ""sunset"" expiry date of 3 February, Boris Johnson has told MPs in a bid to prevent a Commons rebellion.**
The current lockdown ends on Wednesday, and many Tory MPs are unhappy with the toughened tiers that will replace it.
MPs will vote on the system on Tuesday, with Labour undecided on its stance.
In a letter to MPs, the PM said rules could be eased in December, MPs could vote again in January, and the tier system could end in February.
And writing separately in the Mail on Sunday, Mr Johnson said he believed Easter would mark a ""real chance to return to something like life as normal"".
He warned, however, there would be ""disastrous consequences"" for the NHS if the government did not introduce the new tiered system when lockdown ends.
England's new system will see regions placed in one of three tiers: medium, high and very high.
In total, 99% of England will enter the highest two tiers, with tight restrictions on bars and restaurants and a ban on households mixing indoors. Only Cornwall, the Isle of Wight and Isles of Scilly will be in the lowest tier.
In a bid to quell MPs' concerns, Mr Johnson wrote to them outlining a timeline of when - and how - the tiered approach will end.
In his letter, Mr Johnson said:
In his letter to the public, the prime minister urged people to support the new system and ""work together"" with tiering, testing and vaccines.
He said: ""We can't blow it now. We can't just throw it all away - not when freedom is in sight.
""We have worked too hard, lost too many, sacrificed too much, just to see our efforts incinerated in another volcanic eruption of the virus.""
Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told the BBC's Andrew Marr that having a tiered approach ""allows us to have these localised restrictions"".
He said there was a ""risk"" of a third wave ""if we don't get the balance right.""
Asked by Sophy Ridge on Sky News whether the government was looking at breaking counties into smaller areas for the tiers, given differences in rates of the virus within tier areas, Mr Raab said the measures would be reviewed every two weeks.
""But the problem is you've got to get the geographic size sufficiently effective that you don't find the smaller enclaves of lower level virus shooting up because they are not subject to the restrictions in the high levels around them,"" he said.
Labour's shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy told the BBC's Andrew Marr that her party's support of the government's coronavirus restrictions was ""not unconditional"" and they ""will act in the public interest"".
""We need to know first of all that these measures are tough enough to get control of the virus, otherwise what we are asking businesses to do is go through significant pain, people laid off, some businesses at risk of collapsing, without being able to show that this is worth it.""
She added that there also needed to be ""proper support"" in place.
Elsewhere in the UK, Northern Ireland has begun a two-week circuit-breaker lockdown, while in Scotland each area has been placed in one of five tiers.
In Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford said pubs, restaurants and bars will be subject to stricter restrictions - which are not yet finalised - in the run-up to Christmas. They will come into force from Friday, 4 December.
Conservative rebels were increasingly confident that they could demolish Boris Johnson's majority of 80 on Tuesday when the Commons votes on the proposed three tiers of restrictions in England.
That would make the PM reliant on Labour votes to get his measures through - and the opposition hasn't yet committed to backing him.
So, on Saturday night, there was a dramatic intervention to try to defuse the revolt.
In the letter to his MPs, Mr Johnson - in effect - pleads with them to give him the benefit of the doubt this week, in return for a new vote on the restrictions at the end of January.
If the government were to lose that vote, restrictions would end on 3 February.
He also seeks to reassure them that the review of restrictions on 16 December will be genuine, so it's possible some areas could move down a tier before Christmas
But one potential rebel, the former minister Tim Loughton told the BBC that the PM would have to do more to win him over.
He said: ""We asked for a lot of information and that letter doesn't contain it. So unless we get it by Tuesday... then it doesn't change anything I'm afraid.""
It's still possible Mr Johnson's new promises will sway some waverers, though a major rebellion may simply be postponed rather than avoided entirely.
Writing in the Sunday Times, Conservative Damian Green, MP for Ashford in Kent - a tier 3 area - said he would vote against the restrictions on Tuesday.
He said that in Kent there was ""an extraordinary divergence in Covid rates"" and there was ""no logic"" in putting the whole county in the same tier.
""The new approach punishes rural areas next to large towns or cities and is bound to reduce public acceptance of these restrictions,"" he said.
Tory MP Steve Baker said he wanted to see the data the government was basing its new system on.
He tweeted that MPs were ""glad to share in the burden of decision"", but added: ""That's why we need the information necessary to show the government's restrictions will do more good than harm, in full and in time.""
But writing in the Sunday Times, England's deputy chief medical officer Jenny Harries warned: ""If we relax our guard and the virus spreads too quickly then all the hard-won progress will be undone.""
She said that once the lockdown ends in England ""there is no other way to keep the virus under control"", urging people to ""hold on a little longer"".
On Saturday, a further 479 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported in the UK, bringing the total to 58,030. There were also a further 15,871 positive cases registered in the past 24 hours.
Meanwhile, the government has secured a further two million doses of a coronavirus vaccine from US firm Moderna, which has shown to be 95% effective in trials.
This brings the UK's Moderna order to seven million - enough for around 3.5 million people.
Separately, the UK has placed orders for 100 million doses of the Oxford vaccine, and 40 million doses of the jab from Pfizer and BioNTech, which has also been shown to be 95% effective."

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s rosy vision of electric car mobility, like windmills and solar energy, may have once looked good on paper, but it sure is now taking a licking from reality.

“In the process of dying off,” says a German auto expert from the University of Duisburg-Essen. Photo credit:  Michael Movchin, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license.
Now the vision is being carried away to the graveyard in a pine box. The greenie Süddeutsche Zeitung (South German Newspaper) reports on the imminent demise of the electric car. H/t: Benny Peiser. The Süddeutsche Zeitung writes:
So far it hasn’t worked out. The electric auto, which just a few years ago was idolized as a ‘technological revolution for transportation’, just isn’t taking off. The E-Auto project is in the process of dying”, laments Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, auto expert at the University of Duisburg-Essen. […] The pioneers, no question about it, are disappointed.”
And:
On paper the revolution is already rolling. But not on the street. To the contrary: some pilot projects are quietly disappearing.”

Not long ago proponents were pitching the vision of electric cars moving almost silently in the city, producing no smog, accompanied by an extensive network of convenient charging points located at every parking lot and at home…”park and charge” everywhere. Most of the electricity of course would come from wind and sun, and the planet would be saved. And no more extreme weather.
German environmentalists, saw it as an opportunity for Germany to show the world how it’s done and thus got the government to invest massively in the electric car infrastructure.
Today, the whole project appears to be in ruins. Powering electric cars, after all, would have required a far greater supply of electricity. But instead of assuring more production of CO2-free electricity, Germany shot the electric mobility project in the heart when it shut down 8 of its 17 nuclear power plants two years ago. Now the country finds itself importing electricity.
Without the plentiful supply of cheap electricity that nuclear reactors provide, there is no chance of electric car success. At the moment Germany is struggling to supply the basic needs of the country, let alone the power that another 50 million cars would need!
Another obstacle for energy for the electric car is that solar energy and wind energy are nowhere near fulfilling expectations. The industry as a whole has been plagued by bankruptcies. Subsidies are now being cranked back.
Other obstacles of course are the high price of electric cars and their lousy range. Who’s ready to pay $40,000 for what is basically a golf cart and peters out after 100 km?
Electric cars probably could work for many in Germany, if there was a cheap, plentiful and steady supply of electricity. But as long a the country remains stubbornly opposed to nuclear power, then forget about powering cars with electricity.

"**Mass coronavirus testing will be rolled out in a second location in the south Wales valleys.**
People living or working in the lower Cynon valley, which includes Abercynon, Penrhiwceiber and parts of Mountain Ash and Aberaman will be offered tests.
The testing will begin on 5 December and continue until 20 December, the Welsh Government said.
It follows a pilot in Merthyr Tydfil which saw almost 1,000 people tested on its opening day.
Those living in Mountain Ash East and West and Aberaman South will also be eligible for testing.
The mass testing sites in Merthyr opened last weekend and will run until 11 December - about 8,000 people were tested in the first six days there, Health Minister Vaughan Gething said.
The Cynon valley is part of Rhondda Cynon Taf, where the number of coronavirus cases per 100,000 people measured at 252.4 over the most recent seven day period.
The two main test centres will be the Cynon Valley Indoor Bowls Centre in Mountain Ash and the Abercynon Sports Centre, although more sites will be announced in the coming days.
People without symptoms will be tested at the sites, with results being issued within 20 to 30 minutes.
Anyone who tests positive will be told to go home and self-isolate immediately.
Mr Gething said: ""As the Merthyr Tydfil pilot has shown, mass testing is providing us with a greater understanding of prevalence within the community and how many people have coronavirus.
""It's also identifying how many people within the community are asymptomatic. Coronavirus has not gone away and we all need to work together to tackle this deadly virus.
""I want to thank everyone in Merthyr Tydfil who have made the pilot project a success and I would encourage the people of lower Cynon valley to get tested.""
Andrew Morgan, the leader of Rhondda Cynon Taf council, said: ""This is an integral part of our fight against the virus, as it gives us a greater understanding of the prevalence and level of transmission within our communities.
""Following the positive progress seen in the downward trajectory of daily cases and the positivity rate after both the local measures and the national firebreak lockdown, it is now important that we identify and isolate those who are asymptomatic within our communities to break those chains of transmission as cases are now starting to rise again.""
Speaking to Gareth Lewis on BBC Radio Wales, Labour member of the Senedd for Cynon Valley, Vikki Howells, said: ""Those are the areas where we have seen the highest rates of coronavirus in the last few months so it's very important to focus on those.
""Just yesterday I was in Abercynon and the vicar told me there that he's averaging three coronavirus-related funerals a week. Facts like that really bring it home.
""I would say do the right thing for the sake of the community, we look at Merthyr, the tests seem to be going very well there."""

Saudi Arabia’s prodigal son returns to Washington this week, beginning a tour through the United States apparently aimed at drumming up investment in the country. Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) is young with big ideas: he wants to reform Saudi society and wean the Saudi economy off oil. He also wants to build up Saudi as a foreign policy player – with or without the United States – and cement Saudi dominance in the Gulf.   
  
It’s small wonder then that profiles and articles about the prince typically either laud him as a great reformer or simply criticize his foreign policy blunders. The truth is an accurate portrayal of Mohammed bin Salman must include both. And policymakers and businesses should be wary of the potential pitfalls of his proposed reforms, even as they hope for their success.   
  
The Crown Prince’s social reforms are a welcome step in the right direction, though they will be difficult to complete. Thus far, there has been a crackdown on the religious police, robbing them of much of their power over morality issues. Cinemas have been permitted to screen movies for the first time in decades. Women can now attend sporting events, and legal changes are in progress that will allow them to drive.   
  
Likewise, the innovative economic reforms that MBS has proposed – notably using an IPO of Aramco stock to shift the government’s primary income source away from oil and towards investment gains, paired with an attempt to reform the domestic economy and attract inward investment – could potentially reshape and improve the state of the Saudi economy.   
  
There is no doubt that U.S. policymakers should welcome these changes and encourage Saudi Arabia to continue down this path.   
  
Unfortunately, on the flip side, the assertiveness shown by MBS at home has been matched by an extremely bellicose foreign policy. The young prince’s foreign policy overreach has already helped to create the world’s worst humanitarian crisis in Yemen. The Saudi blockade of Qatar has been spectacularly ineffectual and has hardened into stalemate. 



Worse, both incidents reflect the prince’s worst quality: his hardline stance on Iran and his willingness to see Iranian tentacles behind every crisis, no matter how unrealistic this view is. In his interview on CBS’ 60 Minutes, for example, he blames Shi’ite Iran for the rise of Al Qaeda and other Sunni militant groups and for the civil war in Yemen. His fixation on Iran risks destabilizing the Middle East still further.   
  
Nor are the bad parts of MBS’ record limited to foreign policy. He has cracked down heavily on corruption inside Saudi Arabia, a seemingly praiseworthy campaign that in reality saw him imprison other prominent royals and businessmen in the Ritz Carlton hotel until they agreed to sign over many of their assets to the state. And the prince has ruthlessly centralized power into his own hands, shifting Saudi Arabia from a relatively consensual system of government within the royal family, to a system of one-man rule closer to that of Egypt or Syria.   
  
Policymakers – and indeed, businesses and potential investors – should also be wary of the flaws and potential problems in MBS’ ambitious reform plans. Reform is a slow process, and thus far, there have been no moves to fix some of the worst injustices in the Saudi system, notably the guardianship system for women and ongoing repression of Saudi Shi’ites.   
  
Economic reform is certainly not guaranteed to work either; as with many other oil-rich states, Saudi Arabia will find it brutally hard to wean itself off of oil. Some of the biggest developments in the reform plan thus far are fantastical. The proposed high technology city of Neom sounds impressive till one questions why tech companies would choose to relocate to somewhere with Saudi Arabia’s poor climate, workforce, legal and regulatory systems.   
  
Meanwhile, the much-touted IPO of Aramco will only be able to happen on Western exchanges if substantial changes are made to Aramco’s record-keeping, transparency and perhaps even ownership structure.   
  
And none of this is to mention the issue that combines business and national security concerns in one tight package: civilian nuclear power. Though MBS is seeking U.S. cooperation in building civilian nuclear plants ostensibly to reduce Saudi dependence on domestic oil production, he is also open about the fact that he sees civilian nuclear energy and enrichment capabilities as a potential path to a Saudi nuclear weapon.   
  
For all these reasons, policymakers and investors should be wary of profiles which portray Mohammed bin Salman as either a great reformer, or a callow youth. His proposed reforms for Saudi society are in many ways far-sighted; they carry the potential to fix many of the country’s underlying structural and social problems and should be encouraged.   
  
But at the same time, we can’t overlook his many mistakes and poor choices in domestic and foreign policy, nor ignore the risks inherent in his ongoing reform plans. Being an apparently genuine reformer doesn’t absolve MBS of his aggressive foreign policy steps or domestic authoritarian tendencies.   
  
A complete picture of the young prince’s record suggests caution on the part of investors – and pushback on foreign policy and domestic crackdowns by policymakers – remains by far the best choice.

"**When the prime minister addressed the nation on Thursday following the announcement of England's latest tier restrictions, he reserved much praise for one city in particular.**
Despite recording the third highest coronavirus spike in Europe just six weeks ago, Liverpool's restrictions have been downgraded.
Boris Johnson described it as ""a success story which we want other parts of the country to replicate"", so how exactly did they do it?
On a clear night in late July, Liverpool lifted the Premier League trophy, the club's first top flight success in 30 years. The spring wave of Covid-19 cases was largely over and life was beginning to get back on track. But local health experts were concerned.
""I think it's fair to say that we were always worried in Liverpool,"" says Louise Kenny, executive pro-vice chancellor at the University of Liverpool's health and life sciences department.
""I think those of us who were well-sighted on the amount of community transmission were always worried that we would have a bad second wave because we never got down to the exceptionally low levels that were seen elsewhere in the country.""
As schools reopened, pubs got busier and the prime minister encouraged workers back to the office, cases in Liverpool started to rise once more.
Before long, a slow trickle became a rapid spike, with 635 cases per 100,000 recorded in the city region on 12 October. Despite some very public warnings, Joe Anderson says he wasn't able to speak directly to the government until shortly before that peak.
Downing Street had been formulating a three-tier system and he was invited to join a video call with Mr Johnson's senior adviser Lord Lister and Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick.
During long, sometimes tense, meetings over three consecutive days, the three men and officials on either side thrashed out the details of a plan.
They all agreed that Liverpool should enter the highest tier, but arguments focused on a financial relief package.
On the third evening, an agreement had been all but reached. But with the finer points still to be signed off and Liverpool's MPs not yet officially in the loop, details of the negotiations leaked.
""We found out from the news,"" says one Liverpool MP.
""The government didn't talk to local MPs at all, it was pretty disgraceful.""
Like most of the UK, Liverpool was still reeling from the financial effects of the spring lockdown and some worried that further restrictions would only make the situation worse.
At the Micah Liverpool food bank, executive director Paul O'Brien says he and other volunteers noticed a change.
""You can see it sort of physically when people walk up to the food bank. I think once you've been doing these things for a couple of years, myself and the volunteers are able to say 'oh, they're coming to the food bank'.
""Then all of a sudden those people who you think are just walking past are coming in and you think 'oh, they're using the food bank as well'.
""These are people who've only just come out of work or not long come out of work, have used up all their savings and now they've been forced into a position where they've had to use a food bank.""
Several business owners phoned Mr Anderson in tears over the measures, but the mayor was determined that lives should come first.
That position became all too close to home when on 16 October, just two days after Liverpool officially entered tier three, the mayor's brother, Bill, passed away.
""Bill was in the intensive care unit in the Royal Liverpool Hospital,"" says Mr Anderson.
""He was taken in at 2 o'clock in the afternoon. At quarter to 10 that evening he lost the battle.
""I'm absolutely clear that if lockdown would have happened in September, then Bill I believe would be alive today, but so would many other thousands of people.""
For some time, the government had been considering piloting a system of mass testing. During that initial wrangling with Lord Lister, Mr Anderson sniffed an opportunity.
""I said to Ed Lister, it's not just about money, we need some physical resources, so what about using the armed forces to help us manage and do some of things around testing and his jaw dropped a little bit.""
Several days later, Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who knew Mr Anderson from his days as Theresa May's culture secretary, called up the mayor of Liverpool to ask if he'd be interested in hosting the pilot.
The conversation didn't last long.
""I grabbed it with both hands,"" says the mayor, ""because I knew it was going to help us.""
Liverpool has a long history of public health interventions, including a period of mass testing for TB in 1959. That local expertise was soon drawn upon.
""We were offered the chance to work with the Department of Health and Social Care,"" says the University of Liverpool's Louise Kenny, ""and our military colleagues who very kindly came to the city to provide logistics and support for the rollout.""
""But we've had a pretty free rein really in the ongoing design of how best to use that capacity for serial testing and what the university brings is the ability to analyse this pilot and provide that data to inform next steps, both locally and hopefully nationally,"" she adds.
Since mass testing began in early November, research has shown that take-up in the city's most deprived areas has been low and Paul O'Brien says many of the people he meets at the food bank have concerns about both testing and vaccines.
""Exactly what's happened with the testing seems to have happened with the vaccine and I do think it will be something that people get behind eventually, but we just need more information.
""There's so much, sort of, ambiguity about where it's going to be rolled out, when it's going to be rolled out, who are the target groups it's going to be rolled out to.
""There's just so many unanswered questions aren't there?""
Since mass testing began in Liverpool, the number of cases there has fallen rapidly.
After Thursday's announcement that Liverpool will be downgraded to tier two, Joe Anderson has pointed to the wider city's efforts.
Some in government have heaped praise on Liverpool's leaders, suggesting that the key factor was the speed with which they agreed to the original tier three restrictions in October, in contrast they say with areas like Greater Manchester.
But that's not a comparison that sits favourably with the mayor.
""I think it's outrageous to be frank. We're not a poodle, we're not a lapdog. I resent and reject any claims of compliance.
""I wish they would say it to my face, because I've got a pair of boxing gloves downstairs, I'd smack them right in the gob."""

Snow, cold batter Northern Hemisphere.
Coldest UK winter in 100 years possible!
The online UK Telegraph here reports that “councils are gearing up for what could be Britain’s coldest winter in 100 years, as sub-zero temperatures and snow follow days of downpours that have devastated large parts of the country.”
The Telegraph warns that this weekend’s cold and snow could be around for awhile:
The forthcoming cold snap, caused by clear skies and northerly winds, could herald the start of a freezing winter. There are reports that temperatures could fall as low as -20°c in some areas in December and January.”
Cold, snow fly in the face of UN climate models
Cold and snow are forecast to hit Scandinavia and Central Europe as well, which all flies in the face of claims made by climate scientists just a few years ago, whose models predicted snow “would become rare, and a thing of the past.” The online The Local reports that northern Sweden Saturday “will see temperatures dip down to between minus 12 and 20 degrees Celsius”. Moscow forecasts it’s biggest November snowstorm in 50 years (hat/tip: Steven Goddard/).
As Alaska shivers, EPA threatens fines if people don’t stop burning wood!

In addition to Europe, Alaska and Canada have been enduring a long and bitter cold snap. Fairbanks, Alaska “has been experiencing unusually cold November weather with temperatures dropping into the minus-30s overnight”. The Fairbanks Daily News-Miner reports that the Fairbanks area air pollution sensors this week have recorded high particulate pollution levels from widespread use of wood and oil-burning stoves. As Alaskans burn wood and coal in a bid to keep warm, the EPA “has ordered the state to clean up Fairbanks air or face financial penalties”.
Record Arctic refreeze!
Meanwhile, the media are dead-cold silent when it comes to the massive Arctic sea ice recovery seen since October 1st – a record of almost 6 million square kilometers have been added. Never has the Arctic refrozen so much, so fast. Some experts are calling the scope of the refreeze “unprecedented” and “dramatic”. Even the other hemisphere as been too cold; Antarctica has seen above average sea ice extent for every month for the past year. The 30-year upward trend shows no sign of abating.
Also New Zealand, where it is now almost summer, is forecast to get snow!
Snow, cold in India and Pakistan
Cold is also reported in India. The Hindu reports here:
The entire tribal belt of Kinnaur, Lahaul-Spiti and Pangi, and Bharmour in Chamba district is reeling under a severe cold wave and may receive rain or snow at isolated locations in the higher reaches in next few hours.
The temperature in Kalpa was 1.4 degrees. It was three degrees in the tourist resorts of Manali and Bhuntar; four degrees in Solan and Sunderngar; five to seven degrees in Chamba, Shimla and Una; eight degrees in Dharamsala and 10 degrees in Nahan.”
With all the cold gripping the globe, clearly hundreds of millions could use a little global warming.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman climate catastrophe-obsessed blogsite klimaretter.com here has a 2-part story on a recent alarmist panel discussion held in Berlin and sponsored by Germany’s version of the Guardian, the TAZ. The panel discussion was dubbed: “The climate conference circus!  Just how stupid is it?” The motto of the 2-hour discussion: “It can’t keep on like this!”
Photo right: Oliver Geden
A better title may have been: Is it better to keep pretending? That’s the question the discussion panel addressed – for real!
Part 1 here, Part 2 here.
The main speakers were the constantly climate-petrified Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute (PIK), and green thinker Oliver Geden (photo above right) of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs.
The two experts are not at all happy that their beloved green movement is horribly bogged down in an endless swamp with no hope of ever getting out. Geden unloaded over the crumbling green movement and especially the 2°C target: “a placebo designed to pacify society“, an instrument that allows people “to act like they are doing something when in fact they are not.” He called the 2°C target “nothing but talk“. Geden has had enough and is now calling on the warmists to wake up and face the truth: “The 2°C target is hopeless.”
Recall that for German warmists the “2°C target” is really just a code-word for “almost complete decarbonisation by 2050”.
To reach the “2°C target”, Rahmstorf claims that “not a single conventional power plant must be allowed to be built globally after 2017” and that the planet would have to reduce its GHG emissions 10% by 2020. An impossibility.
And slowly it is beginning to dawn on the diehard warmists that reaching this pie-in-the-sky CO2 reduction target is a pipe dream of the 10th order. In fact the opposite trend is today’s reality: CO2 emissions rose in 2012 and coal is making a comeback. Geden sees it, and commented on the “2°C target”: “We are living in a fantasy world.” Geden is now asking his fellow warmists to come to terms with this reality.
But the warmists and Rahmstorf refuse to hear it. If the 2°C target is abandoned, then the whole thing goes.

Rahmstorf blames the spiraling failure on policymakers, saying: “the political resolve is missing“. Yet Rahmstorf and the audience refused to share Geden’s pessimism and demands to face the reality. According to klimaretter, Rahmstorf defiantly declared: “We will fight to the end!” The crowd applauded for the first time, klimaretter writes.
Klimaretter at the very end poses the following (remarkable) question:
Are we playing into the hands of the climate protection opponents when someone like Geden requests that we really have to be honest and declare the 2°C target almost impossible to reach?”
Say what! Yes. this is the question the warmists are now struggling with. Put in simple words: “Do we accept reality, or is it better to keep pretending (so that we don’t maybe play into the wrong hands)?” Unbelievable lows the warmists have maneuvered themselves into.
It’s over. They’re in their bunkers with hands trembling.
Reader krawallo comments:
When mankind stops believing in God, but then indeed in science?
But when science researches only nonsense, then eventually mankind stops believing in science. And then the conferences fail.
It has never been possible to build on lies.”
Our skeptical (calm) hands are open and waiting.

"**A pub owner said she could have cried after hearing it will remain closed in the build-up to Christmas.**
Hundreds of pubs around Bristol will stay shut when lockdown ends, as the city is placed in tier three of the coronavirus restrictions.
Debra Purnell from The Old Inn, Clevedon is one of many owners deeply worried for their future saying the move ""could bankrupt us"".
She plans to offer takeaway meals during the closure.
""I could actually cry. We're gutted. We have put a lot of money into it and this could bankrupt us,"" she said.
We have spoken to other pub and restaurant owners in Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire to find out how tier three restrictions will impact their businesses.
Navina Bartlett, who runs events catering company Coconut Chilli in Bristol, said before lockdown she was catering for festivals, weddings and corporate events, and started a takeaway operation when the original set of restrictions were introduced.
""In the first lockdown I was really busy. There wasn't a lot of competition,"" she said.
""But it's been very different in the second lockdown because all the national chains are operating, and lots of the restaurants have geared up their takeaway operations.
""It's been very challenging. Familiar hospitality folk have families to support and often won't have a safety net to fall back on.""
Mike Harris is the owner of the Strawberry Thief bar in Bristol and said even if the city had been placed in tier two, he was not sure if he would have opened.
""As a wet-led pub tier two offers a lot of uncertainty and risk,"" he said.
""There is a lot of frustration this close to Christmas. When you take out the Christmas parties too we have lost the busiest part of the year.
""We are a city centre bar and rely on footfall, with offices and shops being open. We have managed to keep our staff team together and we have a very loyal customer base so we are confident they will always come back.""
But Paul Kemp who leases The Crown pub in St Nicholas Market and runs the Beerd beer and pizza firm in St Michael's Hill, Bristol, said the second lockdown had been ""very, very different to the first"".
""In the spring and summer we were selling more alcohol from Beerd as off-site sales than we've ever sold. But in the second lockdown, with the nights being darker and people being more worried about their jobs...there's been a big dip.
""When Boris Johnson announced 'don't go to pubs' in March, the leases were worth nothing overnight.""
Shamsi Kabbara and her partner Dave Lawrence picked up the keys to their new restaurant on the same day the second national lockdown was announced.
The couple have been forced to begin life at Amigos Cocina in Chipping Sodbury by offering takeaway food only, but hope to be able to welcome their first seated customers later in December when tier levels are reassessed.
Ms Kabbara said ""you couldn't make up"" the timing of the lockdown as they prepared to launch, but understands the importance of keeping vulnerable people safe, as Mr Lawrence underwent a double lung transplant last year.
""I was scared we would go into tier three. We were fully booked. Like a lot of independent businesses we have been so stringent in social distancing and cleaning. Hospitality has just been hit again.
""I know from our own experience we have to keep people safe and protect the NHS. We just have to stay positive.
""We can get people in at tier two but it's the wet-led pubs I feel sorry for. We feel quite fortunate in that respect.""

If not, Laila Laurel has designed just the chair for you. If you are a man and are guilty of manspreading then she has the cure; if you are a woman and are guilty of not womanspreading then she has a chair for that as well. 



Don’t laugh – she picked up a top award for the design. This is clearly an exciting solution to one of humankind’s greatest problems.



Laila Laurel, 23, says she was inspired to create the chair, which makes use of two cleverly positioned bits of wood, following her own experiences of ‘manspreading’.



If you’re unaware, ‘manspreading’ is the term used to describe when some fellas sit with their legs wide apart in public places, with a disregard for other people’s personal space. It became a talked-about phenomenon back in 2013 and has since even been added to the Oxford English Dictionary.



Laurel, who is set to graduate with a degree in 3D Design and Craft from the University of Brighton later this month, said: “It came both from my own experiences of men infringing on my space in public, and also from ‘The Everyday Sexism Project’, a website founded by Laura Bates in which women self-testify about sexism they experience.



“With my chair set I hoped to draw awareness to the act of sitting for men and women and inspire discussion around this.”



Her work has been awarded the Belmond Award for emerging talent, with a judging panel saying Laurel’s chair was ‘ **a bold, purpose-driven design that explores the important role of design in informing space, a person’s behaviour and society issues of today** ‘.



I presume it will also solve climate change, but that was not explicitly mentioned in the judges’ citation.



The award looks for designs that show ‘imaginative and cleverly presented ideas with a considered overall look and feel along with the quality of work displayed’.



Laurel, who is from Norwich, said: “I am completely shocked but very happy and honoured to have won the Belmond Award – and I am looking forward to designing with them this year.” […]



Laurel hasn’t stopped there with her chair designs either. She’s created a second seat intended for women, which encourages them to sit with their legs a little wider apart.



There is a whole lot more beauty and functionality in the drainpipe than either of those ugly monstrosities.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI’ve been wondering when the PIK would take off the muzzle they seemed to have put on Rahmstorf after a German court fined him for spreading untruths about a journalist who dared to contradict his science. On that read: Lubos here, court-certification here, and here.
Using the occasion of low Arctic ice, Rahmstorf now comes out swinging again, and looking at today’s performance, it probably won’t too long before he slips and winds up in court again. Talk about being debate-intolerant!
Today he has a guest piece in the lefty Süddeutsche Zeitung (South German Newspaper) titled: In the vicious circle of warming. And true to his style, he goes after the skeptics like a famished pitbull on red meat.
First Rahmstorf misleads the readers (surprise, surprise) and warns that all that melting ice in question up there (0.006% of the world’s ice) may very well have serious consequences for the entire planet. He quotes Jennifer Francis of Ruttgers University: “The question is not whether sea ice will impact global circulation, rather it is: How could it not?” Maybe because the sea ice amount in the Arctic is much too small compared to the sheer volume of the oceans?
Then he laments that the reduced albedo will lead to a vicious circle of accelerating ice melt and global climate collapse.
There’s enough ice on Greenland to raise global sea level by seven meters, and so the loss of just a fraction of that ice would have grave consequences.”
Well, we’ve been watching tide gauge data (and not crystal ball models) very closely and the observations are certainly clear – no accelerating sea level rise. And Mr Rahmstorf wonders why we are skeptical? Never mind that global temperatures have’t risen this century.
In his screed, Rahmstorf carefully cherry-picks, always citing the studies from the most alarmist warmists.  Never does he cite from the hundreds of peer-reviewed papers that contradict his end-of-world claims.
In his piece, Rahmstorf tries to have it both ways, claiming that both droughts and floods, heat and bitter cold, are all evidence of man-made global warming climate change. For Rahmstorf, the distribution of weather measures are no longer Gaussian, rather it is now bathtub shaped – lots of weather at the extremes and nothing in the middle. Listening to Rahmstorf, you’d think he’s the marketing director at Munich Re reinsurance company trying to scare his clients into buying a insurance policy.
Turns out, he is connected to the Munich Reinsurer.

//-->




Throughout, Rahmstorf’s tone is frustrated and spiteful towards debate. Things are not moving quickly enough for him. In his view, the obstacles are clearly the skeptics. He’s annoyed that skeptics have the gall to question the differences in the various sets of Arctic sea ice data. He writes:
‘Climate skeptics’ have seen the differences as reasons for manipulation accusations – the pertinent websites serve a niche audience of conspiracy theorists. Already in 2008 there were accusations of manipulation, which back then had to be retracted. Back then the ‘climate skeptics’ polemicized: ‘The Arctic refuses to melt’.  The occasion they used was that the record of 2007 was not broken the very next year.”
The troubling part about Rahmstorf’s position is that he is only open to the Arctic factor of “warming”. Nowhere does he show any degree of openness that other factors are at play…ocean currents, soot, storms spreading the ice, etc.. For Rahmstorf it’s only man, Co2 and imminent tipping points. He adds:
We’ll hear more of the same in the years ahead as well, because natural weather-dependent fluctuations are superimposed over the downward trend and so a new record cannot be expected every year.”
Yes, when it melts, it’s climate. But when it freezes, it’s weather. If it’s the Arctic, it’s climate. If it’s Antarctica, it’s weather. If it’s a hurricane, it’s climate, but if it’s a light spring shower, it’s weather. If it’s too hot, it’s climate. If it’s too cold, it’s weather. So is the science of Stefan Rahmstorf.
He ends by implying that we have to stop listening to the skeptics and that 0.006% part of the world’s ice is:
…now sending us a clear alarm signal – we can only hope that the people will no longer keep closing their eyes to it.”

Normally the answer to that question would revolve around whether you had been out playing in the mud with your 4×4 or the time elapsed since you last visited the carwash or got out the bucket and cloth.



But no, in the brave new world of climate idiocy, ‘dirty’ now refers to a colourless, odourless, harmless gas that feeds our economy by growing vegetation.



The **Government has dirty cars in its sights** and newly-released industry figures show that some of the most expensive motor vehicle brands available in New Zealand produce the **most pollution.**



The carbon dioxide emissions of all car brands sold in New Zealand in 2018 have been revealed by the Motor Industry Association, with luxury marque Rolls-Royce topping the list with an average of 326 grams of CO2 per kilometre travelled.



That’s more than double our **cleanest** fossil-fuelled brand, with cars from French manufacturer Citroen averaging 122g per km.



Brands that typically sell cars – or vans – with bigger engines rank further up the average emissions list.



Flat at the bottom of the list, however, is US electric car maker Tesla whose cars all run solely on electricity and don’t produce carbon emissions.



Other luxury brands are big emitters too, with McLaren, Bentley and Ferrari all averaging over 200g per km.



Lamborghini sits behind Rolls-Royce with 316g per km.



It should come as no surprise that most of the biggest emitters are brands noted for their big-engined sports cars and it’s important to note that they make up a small fraction of our national fleet. […]



  
CO2 is not, and never has been, a pollutant. 



CO2 is not, and never has been, ‘dirty’.



You cannot find an image of CO2 online, so they have to photoshop it in using water vapour (aka clouds):



The real pollution from cars, the real dirt, comes from small particulate matter generated by the brake pads and tyres. Last I checked the ‘clean’ EV cars also had tyres and brakes. 



Next years’ EVs will probably build on the Marty McFly Hoverboard concept to ensure that they are truly clean. Obviously they will, first, need to resolve the patent dispute with the Jetson SpaceCar Company.

Now I do know that short term issues are no indicator of either past or future weather or climate, but I was wondering. Please Sir, may I have some Global Warming?



I have owned my current property for about 8 years and this is the first time we have had a **glacier in our back yard**! This is not just snow left on the ground, it is actual water that has seeped out from the hill and frozen on the ground.



I’m not sure quite how to deal with this phenomenon so I was hoping that our gentle Oilers may have some bright ideas. So help a bloke out, what exactly should I do with my new found glacier?



But more to the point, how do you think that the Climate Alarmists will spin this as definitive proof that the world is warming at an alarming rate? Let’s hear your thoughts in the comments section below. Man, where’s C4M when you need him?

Clarification on BEST submitted to the House
Pielke Sr. on the Muller testimony
Independent company station siting analysis demonstrates the problem
Quote of the Week – other scientists weigh in

Guest Post by Willis Eschenbach
Well, I had hoped for the best from BEST, the new Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature project looking at the global temperature record. I was disheartened, however, by the Congressional testimony of Dr. Richard Muller of BEST.
Photo Source He said (emphasis mine):
Global Warming
Prior groups at NOAA, NASA, and in the UK (HadCRU) estimate about a 1.2 degree C land temperature rise from the early 1900s to the present. This 1.2 degree rise is what we call global warming. Their work is excellent, and the Berkeley Earth project strives to build on it.
Human caused global warming is somewhat smaller. According to the most recent IPCC report (2007), the human component became apparent only after 1957, and it
amounts to “most” of the 0.7 degree rise since then. Let’s assume the human-caused warming is 0.6 degrees.
The magnitude of this temperature rise is a key scientific and public policy concern. A 0.2 degree uncertainty puts the human component between 0.4 and 0.8 degrees – a factor of two uncertainty. Policy depends on this number. It needs to be improved.
Why do I think his testimony doesn’t help in the slightest? Well, to start with, I’ve never heard anyone make the claim that the land surface air temperature (excluding oceans) of the earth has warmed 1.2°C since 1900.

He cites three land temperature datasets, NOAA , NASA (GISTEMP), and HadCRU (he presumably means CRUTEM, not HadCRU).
Here’s the problem. The actual land surface air temperature warming since 1900 according to the existing datasets is:
NASA GISTEMP: 0.72°C
NOAA NCDC: 0.86°C
CRUTEM: 0.92°C
So Dr. Muller, in his first and most public appearance on the subject, has made some of the more unusual claims about the existing temperature datasets I’ve heard to date.
1. Since the largest temperature rise in the three datasets is 30% greater than the smallest rise, their work is not “excellent” in any sense of the word. Nor should the BEST team “strive to build on it.” Instead, they should strive to understand why the three vary so widely. What decisions make the difference? Which decisions make little difference?
2. Not one of the three datasets shows a temperature rise anywhere near the 1.2°C rise Muller is claiming since 1900. The largest one shows only about 3/4 of his claimed rise.
3. He claims a “0.2 degree uncertainty”. But the difference between the largest and smallest calculated warming from the three datasets is 0.2°C, so the uncertainty has to be a lot more than that …
4. He says that the land warming since 1957 is 0.7°C. The records beg to differ. Here’s the land warming since 1957:
NASA GISTEMP: 0.83°C
NOAA NCDC: 1.10°C
CRUTEM: 0.93°C
Note that none of them are anywhere near 0.7°C. Note also the huge difference in the trends in these “excellent” datasets, a difference of half a degree per century.
5. He fails to distinguish CRUTEM (the land-only temperature record produced by the Climategate folks) from HadCRU (a land-ocean record produced jointly by the Hadley folks and the Climategate folks). A minor point to be sure, but one indicating his unfamiliarity with the underlying datasets he is discussing.
It can’t be a Celsius versus Fahrenheit error, because it goes both ways. He claims a larger rise 1900-present than the datasets show, and a smaller rise 1958-present than the datasets.
I must confess, I’m mystified by all of this. With his testimony, Dr. Muller has totally destroyed any credibility he might have had with me. He might be able to rebuild it by explaining his strange numbers. But to give that kind of erroneous testimony, not in a random paper he might written quickly, but to Congress itself, marks him to me as a man driven by a very serious agenda, a man who doesn’t check his work and who pays insufficient attention to facts in testimony. I had hoped we wouldn’t have another temperature record hag-ridden by people with an axe to grind … foolish me.
Perhaps someone who knows Dr. Muller could ask him to explain his cheerleading before Congress. I call it cheerleading because it certainly wasn’t scientific testimony of any kind I’m familiar with. I hear Dr. Muller is a good guy, and very popular with the students, but still … color me very disappointed.
w.
PS – Muller also said:
Let me now address the problem of
Poor Temperature Station Quality
Many temperature stations in the U.S. are located near buildings, in parking lots, or close to heat sources. Anthony Watts and his team has shown that most of the current stations in the US Historical Climatology Network would be ranked “poor” by NOAA’s own standards, with error uncertainties up to 5 degrees C.
Did such poor station quality exaggerate the estimates of global warming? We’ve studied this issue, and our preliminary answer is no.
The Berkeley Earth analysis shows that over the past 50 years the poor stations in the U.S. network do not show greater warming than do the good stations.
Thus, although poor station quality might affect absolute temperature, it does not appear to affect trends, and for global warming estimates, the trend is what is important.
Dr. Muller, I’m going to call foul on this one. For you to announce your pre-publication results on this issue is way, way out of line. You get to have your claim entered into the Congressional Record and you don’t even have to produce a single citation or publish a paper or show a scrap of data or code? That is scientific back-stabbing via Congressional testimony, and on my planet it is absolutely unacceptable.
That is taking unfair advantage of your fifteen minutes of fame. Show your work and numbers like anyone else and we’ll evaluate them. Then you may be able to crow, or not, before Congress.
But to stand up before Congress as an expert witness and refer solely to your own unpublished, uncited, and un-verifiable claims? Sorry, but if you want to make that most public scientific claim, that bad siting doesn’t affect temperature trends, you have to show your work just like anyone else. If you want to make that claim before Congress, then PUBLISH YOUR DATA AND CODE like the rest of us mortals. Put your results where your mouth is, or if not, leave it out of your Congressional testimony. Why is that not obvious?
Anthony’s unpublished and unverifiable claims are as strong as your similar claims. That is to say, neither have any strength or validity at all at this point … so how would you feel if Anthony trotted out his unverifiable claims before Congress to show that Dr. Richard Muller was wrong, and didn’t show his work?
Like I said … color me very disappointed, both scientifically and personally. Dr. Muller, I invite you to explain your Congressional testimony, because I certainly don’t understand it. I am totally confident that Anthony will be happy to publish your reply.
I also urge you to either a) publish the data and code that you think shows no difference in trends between good and poor stations, or b) publicly retract your premature and unverifiable claims. You don’t get to do one without the other, that’s not scientific in any sense of the word.
PPS – Does any of this mean that the BEST analysis is wrong or their numbers or data are wrong or that the BEST folks are fudging the results? ABSOLUTELY NOT. I am disappointed in Dr. Muller’s claims and his actions. The math and the data analysis is an entirely different question. Theirs may be flawless, we simply don’t know yet (nor would I expect to, it’s early days). I look forward to their results and their data and code, this kind of initiative is long overdue.
I want to be very clear than the validity of their actual methods depends only on the validity of their actual methods. The problem is, we don’t even know exactly what those methods are yet. We have rough descriptions, but not even any pseudocode, much less code. Which in part is why I find Dr. Muller’s testimony unsettling …
RELATED: See the rebuttal letter to congress:
Clarification on BEST submitted to the House
Pielke Sr. on the Muller testimony
=========================================================

UPDATE: in apparent response to Willis Eschenbach, BEST has added this below to their FAQs page. For fairness, I reproduce it here. – Anthony

NEW (4/1) – It appears that in Dr. Muller’s testimony he shows a temperature rise greater rise than others had previously published.  Is this so?  Can you explain?
The Berkeley Earth plot is for the land data only, since we have not yet  begun analysis of ocean temperatures.  Because we only analyze land,  that was the fair comparison to make.  The ocean temperature rise is less, and when included in, it reduces the  value of the total temperature rise.
We started with the land data for several reasons:

It is the data that is affected most by the most contentious issues: data selection bias, urban heat island, and station integrity issues.  These are big concerns and we wanted to address them.
The temperature rise on land is greater than on the oceans, mostly because the ocean distribute the heat over the mixed layer and thereby reduces the temperature rise.   Land keeps the heat mostly on the surface. So the land temperature is actually more sensitive to greenhouse gases than is the world temperature.
 The land issue, with 1.6 billion measurements, was a huge one to tackle. It made sense to divide the effort into two stages.

The land only data for the other three groups are available on their  websites, and agree with the plot provided in Dr. Richard Muller’s  testimony.

"A $2tn US coronavirus relief package will dole out billions to struggling airlines and offer low-interest loans that fossil fuel companies could compete for – without requiring any action to stem the climate crisis. The legislation, passed by the Senate late on Wednesday, includes a $60bn bailout for airlines. Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the Democrat-controlled House, had proposed a requirement for airlines to cut their planet-warming emissions in half by 2050, but that provision is not in the bill. The House is expected to vote on the package on Friday. It also includes nearly $500bn in lending authority that one environment group, Friends of the Earth, called a “corporate slush fund with insufficient guardrails to protect workers, taxpayers and the climate”. Congressional Republicans have accused Democrats of taking advantage of the Covid-19 pandemic to pursue climate policy. The Senate leader, Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said this week that Democrats were “bargaining as usual” with “counter-offers that demanded things like new emission standards or tax credits for solar panels”. Multiple Republican politicians tweeted accusing Democrats of trying to usher in a Green New Deal with massive climate spending during a crisis. In the end, the stimulus package focused on direct aid to individuals and the worst-hit industries, while setting climate considerations aside. Annie Petsonk, international counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund, said that while the situation for airlines and their workers was dire, the industry should have had to commit to slashing emissions as a condition of the aid. “The provisions we were focused on simply would hold the airlines to what they already said they’re going to do,” Petsonk said. “People do not want to solve one crisis by making another crisis worse.” The 2008 auto industry bailout, in comparison, led to stricter rules for pollution from vehicle tailpipes. The bill, the third in a series of stimulus packages, offers virtually nothing to climate advocates, but it is not the last word. Scott Segal, a lawyer and lobbyist with the firm Bracewell LLC, which represents energy industry clients, said a fourth stimulus deal was likely to involve “significant discussions of green objectives”. “Was this a missed opportunity for climate? I think the answer to that is no,” Segal said. “This stimulus package was primarily about getting money into the hands of individual households and workers and in some service sectors that were particularly hurt.” Kevin Book, the managing director of ClearView Energy Partners, a research firm, said: “Congress is going to be making more deals, and as long as there is a deal to be made, Democrats have made clear what they want.” Democrats negotiated multiple measures meant to prevent abuse of the $500bn available in lending, including an oversight board, a special inspector general and provisions aimed at limiting Donald Trump’s businesses from benefiting – an issue that has already come under scrutiny. But climate hawks said those stipulations were not strong enough. “What makes this so frightening is that there are very few binding restrictions on how this money can be used that the secretary of treasury cannot waive,” said Lukas Ross, a senior policy analyst with Friends of the Earth.  “It’s great that [Trump’s son-in-law ] Jared Kushner isn’t going to get a subsidised line of credit. It’s much more worrying in human terms that Chevron, Exxon and every other polluter you can imagine is eligible to be propped up in terms of the stimulus package.” The bill also does not include specific assistance to the renewable energy industry, although trade associations and lobbyists expect to revisit that possibility as discussions continue about more targeted aid for at-risk sectors of the economy. The American Wind Energy Association (AWEA) projects that the US wind industry could lose 35,000 jobs and $35bn in investment. Those losses could lead to lease payment and tax revenue reductions for local and state governments. No tax credit extensions have been granted for the solar and wind industries, meaning they may lose access to credits if they miss deadlines. “Obviously of primary importance is the public health and keeping the economy moving. We applaud that big effort,” said Tom Kiernan, the chief executive of the AWEA, adding that his group would continue to push for tax provisions to stem industry losses. The Solar Energy Industries Association said the solar sector could lose half its jobs, meaning “125,000 families who will no longer receive a paycheck”. Abigail Ross Hopper, its president and CEO, said: “Legislators were really focused on industry-wide protections and assistance, like the unemployment insurance, like the loans for which our companies are eligible, and did not include industry-specific solutions for a couple of particularly hard hit ones.” In one climate win for Democrats, the bill does not include a discussed $3bn to buy oil to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in order to lift global oil prices."

In case you missed it, President Obama and former Vice President Dick Cheney spoke separately today on terrorism and national security. Like two boxers at a pre-fight press conference, they each touted their strength over their opponent. They espoused deep differences in their views on national counterterrorism strategy.   
  
The Thrilla in Manilla it ain't. As Gene Healy has pointed out, they agree on a lot more than they admit to. Harvard Law professor and former Bush Office of Legal Counsel head Jack Goldsmith makes the same point at the _New Republic_. Glenn Greenwald made a similar observation.   
  
However, the areas where they differ are important: torture, closing Guantanamo, criminal prosecution, and messaging. In these key areas, Obama edges out Cheney.   




**Torture**   
  
Cheney: 



I was and remain a strong proponent of our enhanced interrogation program. The interrogations were used on hardened terrorists after other efforts failed. They were legal, essential, justified, successful, and the right thing to do.



Obama: 



I reject the assertion that these are the most effective means of interrogation. What's more, they undermine the rule of law. They alienate us in the world. They serve as a recruitment tool for terrorists, and increase the will of our enemies to fight us, while decreasing the will of others to work with America. They risk the lives of our troops by making it less likely that others will surrender to them in battle, and more likely that Americans will be mistreated if they are captured.



Torture is incompatible with our values and our national security interests. When we break our own rules (read: laws) against torture, we erode everyone's faith that America is the good guy in this global fight.   
  
Torture has been embraced by politicians, but the people who are fighting terrorists on the ground want none of it. As former FBI agent Ali Soufan made clear in Senate hearings last week, it is not an effective interrogation technique. Senior military leaders such as General Petraeus, former CENTCOM commanders Joseph Hoar and Anthony Zinni, and former Commandant of the Marine Corps Charles Krulak all denounce the use of torture.   
  
If we captured Al Qaeda operatives who had tortured one of our soldiers in pursuit of information, we would be prosecuting them. Torture is no different and no more justifiable because we are doing it.   
  
**Closing Guantanamo**   
  
Cheney: 



I think the President will find, upon reflection, that to bring the worst of the worst terrorists inside the United States would be cause for great danger and regret in the years to come.



Obama: 



[I]nstead of serving as a tool to counter-terrorism, Guantanamo became a symbol that helped al Qaeda recruit terrorists to its cause. Indeed, the existence of Guantanamo likely created more terrorists around the world than it ever detained.



This is an area where Cheney is disagreeing not just with Obama but with John McCain. We would be having this debate regardless of who won the last Presidential election. Get over it.   
  
The current political climate gives you the impression that we are going to let detainees loose in the Midwest with bus fare and a gift certificate for a free gun at the local sporting goods store. Let's be realistic about this.   
  
We held hundreds of thousands of prisoners of war in America during World War II. The detainees we have now are not ten feet tall and bulletproof, and federal supermax prisons hold the same perfect record of keeping prisoners inside their walls as the detainment facility in Guantanamo Bay.   
  
**Criminal Prosecution**   
  
Obama basically said that we will try those we can, release those who we believe pose no future threat, and detain those that fit in neither of the first two categories. That's not a change in policy and that pesky third category isn't going away.   
  
Obama and Cheney do have some sharp differences as to the reach of war powers versus criminal prosecution.   
  
Cheney: 



And when you hear that there are no more, quote, ""enemy combatants,"" as there were back in the days of that scary war on terror, at first that sounds like progress. The only problem is that the phrase is gone, but the same assortment of killers and would-be mass murderers are still there.



Obama: 



Recently, we prosecuted and received a guilty plea from a detainee - al-Marri - in federal court after years of legal confusion. We are preparing to transfer another detainee to the Southern District of New York, where he will face trial on charges related to the 1998 bombings of our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania - bombings that killed over 200 people.



I have written extensively on al-Marri, the last person to be detained domestically as an enemy combatant. The FBI did everything right when it investigated and indicted this Al Qaeda sleeper agent masquerading as an exchange student, only to have the Bush administration remove those charges in order to preserve the possibility of detaining domestic criminals under wartime powers. This claim of governmental power is a perversion of executive authority that Obama was right to repudiate.   
  
The man being indicted in New York is Ahmed Gailani. If he is convicted for his role in the bombing of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, he will join his co-conspirators Wadih El-Hage, Mohammed Odeh, Mohammed al-Owhali, and Khalfan Mohammed in a supermax.   
  
This is also where we hold 1993 World Trade Center bombers Ramzi Yousef, Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman (the ""Blind Sheikh""), Mohammed Salameh, Sayyid Nosair, Mahmud Abouhalima, and Ahmed Ajaj.   
  
Not to mention would-be trans-pacific airline bombers Wali Khan Amin Shah and Abdul Hakim Murad.   
  
Al Qaeda operatives Mohammed Jabarah, Jose Padilla, and Abu Ali will share his mailing address.   
  
Let's not forget American Taliban Johnny Walker Lindh, Shoe Bomber Richard Reid, Al Qaeda and Hamas financier Mohammed Ali Hassan Al-Moayad, Oregon terrorist training camp organizer Ernest James Ujaama, and would-be Millenium Bomber Ahmed Ressam.   
  
That's a lot of bad guys. It's almost like we're checking names off a list or something.   
  
**Messaging**   
  
Cheney: 



Behind the overwrought reaction to enhanced interrogations is a broader misconception about the threats that still face our country. You can sense the problem in the emergence of euphemisms that strive to put an imaginary distance between the American people and the terrorist enemy. Apparently using the term ""war"" where terrorists are concerned is starting to feel a bit dated.



Obama: no quote is necessary here. The differences in narrative between Obama and Cheney are clear and woven into what Obama says.   
  
Terrorism is about messaging. America finds herself in the unenviable position of fighting an international terrorist group, Al Qaeda, that is trying to convince local insurgents to join its cause. Calling this a ""War on Terror"" can create a war on everybody if we use large-scale military solutions for intelligence, law enforcement, and diplomatic problems.   
  
We have to tie every use of force or governmental power to a message: drop leaflets whenever we drop a bomb, hold a press conference whenever we conduct a raid, and publish a court decision whenever we detain someone. Giving the enemy the initiative in messaging gives them the initiative in the big picture.   
  
**Conclusion**   
  
Once we get past the rhetoric, the differences are few but worth noting. I take Obama in the third round by TKO.

In just a few hours from now, NASA rolls the STEREO BEHIND solar satellite to have a look at Comet Elenin (P/2010 X1), and if you haven’t been paying attention, it is one red hot topic topped with wilder imaginations, dooms, hypotheticals and omens than previously imagined. 
From being on a par with/substitute for Niburu to a first ever hyperbolic (&gt;1) cometary orbit, you’d be hard pressed to make the relevant data up.  Perihelion somewhat around Sept 11, 2011 (maybe they changed it, maybe not) and origin from the Oort Cloud to an interstellar rogue object.  Composition unknown.

"**A couple travelling from Essex to deliver Christmas presents to family were among those stopped for breaking coronavirus laws in Cardiff.**
South Wales Police stopped more than 100 vehicles in the capital on Friday and Saturday.
Twelve people were fined and a further 15 people were asked to leave the city.
Ch Sup Wendy Gunney said people continuing to break the rules were putting others at ""increased risk"".
South Wales Police were granted extra powers, including random vehicle checks, around Cardiff which started from 09:00 GMT on so-called Black Friday.
The checks will continue until 17:00 on Sunday.
Among the 110 people stopped by police in the first 24 hours were a couple who told officers they had travelled from Essex, despite England remaining in lockdown until Wednesday.
A group of nine people travelling in convoy to visit friends in university, were also turned around by officers.
Wales' ""firebreak"" lockdown ended on 9 November, allowing pubs, restaurants and non-essential retailers to reopen, with social-distancing measures in place.
While there are no travel restrictions within Wales, it is currently against the law to travel across the border - in or out - unless you have an essential reason.
The Welsh Government has introduced a ""restricted list of essential purposes"" to allow people to travel between the nations, such as going to work.
The regulations also prevent travel anywhere else outside of Wales.
Under the coronavirus fixed penalty notices system, people can be fined Â£60 for a first offence, which increases to Â£120 for a second offence and continues to double for repeated offences, up to a maximum of Â£1,920.
If prosecuted, however, a court can impose an unlimited fine.
Ch Sup Gunney said: ""I would like to thank the vast majority of people who are enjoying their weekend with caution and within the confines of the existing regulations, but those not adhering to the rules are continuing to put others at increased risk.
""The measures which are in place are in place for a reason. Our checks will continue throughout the weekend, and anybody blatantly flouting the rules, which have been made very clear, face being fined."""
"The car manufacturer Volkswagen subverted key air pollution tests, a British court has found, by using special software to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides under test conditions. The high court finding is a boost to attempts by campaigners to force the company to address the impact of its cars in producing lung-damaging pollutants at far higher levels than were legally permissible.  A group of about 91,000 claimants is taking Volkswagen to court in one of the biggest “class action” cases, or group litigation orders, yet to be heard in England and Wales. Although Volkswagen has been found guilty in the US, in Europe the carmaker has denied that it cheated tests. The preliminary finding in the  case on Monday, by Mr Justice Waksman, casts a fresh light on the activities of the carmaker, first revealed in the “dieselgate” scandal of 2015. In his summary, the judge wrote: “[After considering the arguments made by Volkswagen] the upshot was that I found that the software function in the vehicles here did indeed amount to a prohibited ‘defeat device’… I also concluded that VW’s attempt to relitigate the issue here was an abuse of the process.” He said: “A software function which enables a vehicle to pass the test because (artificially) it operates the vehicle in a way which is bound to pass the test and in which it does not operate on the road is a fundamental subversion of the test … it destroys the utility of the test.” Diesel vehicles were once touted by the car industry as a green alternative to petrol vehicles because they have lower greenhouse gas emissions. But their emissions of tiny particles and irritant gases such as nitrogen dioxide are far higher, unless trapped by filters. In 2015, campaigners revealed that cars produced by Volkswagen emitted far more nitrogen oxides in standard road driving than was recorded in test conditions. The ensuing scandal engulfed the car industry, which has faced turmoil and falling sales in some categories. The revelations also highlighted rampant air pollution around the world, which is estimated to cause as many as 800,000 premature deaths every year in Europe alone. In the UK, the sale of new diesel and petrol cars is to be banned from 2035, in an effort to clear up dangerous air and reduce the impact of road transport on the climate crisis. Jenny Bates, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “Diesel exhaust is in the same category for causing cancer as smoking, according to the World Health Organization, so to deliberately hide this toxicity cannot go unnoticed or indeed unpunished. The sale of all diesel and petrol cars and vans should be banned by 2030, earlier than the government is planning, both for air pollution and climate reasons.” Volkswagen is now likely to continue to a full trial of liability for the claims of deceit. The claimants argue that they were sold vehicles that were represented as being compliant with emissions regulations, when they did not comply. A spokesperson for Volkswagen Group told the Guardian: “The judgment relates only to preliminary issues [and] does not determine liability or any issues of causation or loss for any of the causes of action claimed. These remain to be determined by the court as the case continues. “Volkswagen remains confident in our case that we are not liable to the claimants as alleged and the claimants did not suffer any loss. We will continue to defend our position robustly. Nothing in this decision today changes this.” The group litigation order in the UK is brought against Volkswagen, Audi, Skoda, Seat, the Volkswagen financial services arm, and various authorised dealers, by owners and lessees of cars under these brands which used a particular Volkswagen diesel engine. In the US, Volkswagen has paid out $4.3bn (£3.5bn) in civil and criminal penalties since pleading guilty more than two years ago to criminal charges based on deceit. Global costs are thought to have reached at least $21bn. Gareth Pope, who leads the legal team at the Slater and Gordon law firm, representing 70,000 claimants, said: “This damning judgment confirms what our clients have known for a long time but Volkswagen has refused to accept: that Volkswagen fitted defeat devices into millions of vehicles in the UK in order to cheat emissions tests. “The court’s conclusion that the existence of software was a ‘fundamental subversion’ of tests designed to limit pollution and make our air safe to breath exposes VW’s disregard for EU emissions regulations and public health, in pursuit of profit and market dominance.”"

Writing for _Forbes_ , Bruce Bartlett puts forth an interesting hypothesis that healthcare legislation could have been made better (hopefully he meant to write ""less destructive"") if the GOP had been willing to compromise with Democrats:   




Democrats desperately wanted a bipartisan bill and would have given a lot to get a few Republicans on board. This undoubtedly would have led to enactment of a better health bill than the one we are likely to get. But Republicans never put forward an alternative health proposal. Instead, they took the position that our current health system is perfect just as it is.



Bruce makes several compelling points in the article, especially when he notes that it will be virtually impossible to repeal a bad bill after 2010 or 2012, but there are good reasons to disagree with his analysis. First, he is wrong in stating that Republicans were united against any compromise. Several GOP senators spent months trying to negotiate something less objectionable, but those discussions were futile. Also, I'm not sure it's correct to assert Republicans took a ""the current system is perfect"" position. They may not have offered a full alternative (they did have a few good reforms such as allowing the purchase of insurance across state lines), but their main message was that the Democrats were going to make the current system worse. Strikes me as a perfectly reasonable position, one that I imagine Bruce shares.   
  
Let's explore Bruce's core hypothesis: Would compromise have generated a better bill? It's possible, to be sure, but there are also several reasons why that approach may have backfired:   
  
1\. It's not clear a policy of compromise would have produced a less-objectionable bill. Would Senate Democrats have made more concessions to Grassley and Snowe rather than Lieberman and Nelson (much less whether the ""concessions"" would have been good policy)? And even if Reid made some significant (and positive) concessions, is there any reason to think those reforms would have survived a conference committee with the House? Yet the compromising Republicans probably would have felt invested in the process and obliged to support the final bill — even if the conference committee produced something worse than the original Senate Democrat proposal.   




2\. A take-no-prisoners strategy may be high risk, but it can produce high rewards. In the early 1990s, the Republicans took a no-compromise position when fighting Bill Clinton's health plan (aka, Hillarycare), and that strategy was ultimately successful. We still don't know the final result of this battle (much less how events would have transpired with a different strategy), but if the long-term goal is to minimize government expansion, a no-compromise approach is perfectly reasonable.   
  
3\. A principled opposition to government-run healthcare will help win other fights. The Democrats ultimately may win the healthcare battle, but the leadership will have been forced to spend lots of time and energy, and also use up lots of political chits. Does anyone now think they can pass a ""climate change"" bill? The answer, almost certainly, is no.   
  
4\. A principled approach can be good politics, which can eventually lead to good policy. Democrats wanted a few Republicans on board in part to help give them political cover. The aura of bipartisanship would have given Democrats a good talking point for the 2010 elections (""My opponent is being unreasonable since even X Republicans also supported the legislation""). That fig leaf does not exist now, which makes it more likely that Democrats will pay a heavy price during the midterm elections. It is impossible to know whether 2010 will be a 1994-style rout or whether the newly-elected Republicans will quickly morph into Bush-style big-government conservatives (who often do more damage to liberty than Democrats), but at least there is a reasonable likelihood of more pro-liberty lawmakers.   
  
When all is said and done, Bruce's strategy is not necessarily wrong, but it does guarantee defeat. Government gets bigger and freedom diminishes. For reasons of principle and practicality, Republicans should do the right thing.

It seems that there’s no nanny-state soapbox too pointless that local councils can’t work themselves up into a virtue-signalling lather about it.



Once upon a time, ratepayers laboured under the impression that the role of local councils was to see to it that the rubbish was collected, local business was encouraged, and the neighbourhood kiddies had somewhere decent to kick a ball. Not any more, apparently. Councils these days have far bigger concerns than such trivialities as delivering services to ratepayers.



Councils today seem to have made it their mission to save the world from innumerable perils, from climate change and drinking straws to teenagers popping pingers.



A Hobart culture and events committee has unanimously voted in favour of supporting a pill testing trial at the city’s major events.



The notice of motion set out to minimise the harms associated with illicit drug use at festivals, events, pubs, clubs and venues in Hobart by having in-principle support of pill testing at Hobart events and festivals.



Naturally, this overdose of nanny-state-ism is couched in the usual leftist nostrums of “safety” and “compassion”. However, as members of the public have responded, surely the best way to minimise the harm associated with illicit drug use **is to actually enforce the law** rather than tacitly encourage law-breaking?



 _Can they put a new lane on the Brooker [Highway] for drunks?_ one Hobart local asked. Another wondered whether, if pulled up for a roadside drug test, users could _just say u are heading to the festival to get them checked?_



The trial would require the state government’s support, but its stance against pill testing had remained firm, with newly appointed Health Minister Sarah Courtney saying pill testing was not supported by the government.



“I think it’s very important that as a government we are not sending mixed messages to young people about whether illicit drugs are safe to use or not,” she said…



After the NSW coronial inquest into six drug-related deaths on the mainland, Cr Ewin said staff would put together a brief and a letter of support to the state government, outlining the council’s stance on pill testing and welcoming a trial in Hobart.



“Safety” is, of course, the great lie being peddled here. Pill-testing merely establishes whether the drugs have likely been adulterated – “cut”, as we used to say – with anything from glucose to rat poison. But, just because a tablet is pure MDMA does not make it “safe”. **Most of the deaths from pill-taking at festivals have been overdoses** , not tainted drugs.



It says a great deal about the mental acuity of the average pill-taker, in fact, that evidence shows that a significant percentage consume their drugs even **after** testing shows that they have been adulterated.



A representative from Alcohol, Tobacco, and other Drugs Council Tasmania gave a presentation on what pill testing is and isn’t to the Community, Culture and Events Committee at the Wednesday night meeting.



  
Almost certainly not discussed was the single, basic fact about pill-testing: it’s **your** problem, druggo. No-one else’s.



Pill-testing kits are easily available on ebay for a few dollars. _If people can afford the event tickets and afford to buy the drugs then they should also pay for the pills to be tested themselves_ , said another Hobart resident. _How about people accepting responsibility for their stupidity instead of us taxpayers having to fund things like pill testing. Simple solution. If you take illicit drugs, you know the risks._



Now, in **my** day, you took that brown acid and you rode that bad trip like a man. Unfortunately, “personal responsibility” is a foreign concept to a generation who’ve been raised with the message that everything is a “right” and taxpayers have to give it to them.

"The government agency responsible for the Great Barrier Reef has confirmed the natural landmark has suffered a third mass coral bleaching episode in five years, describing the damage as “very widespread”. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority said the assessment was based on information from in-water and aerial observations, and built on the best available science and technology to understand current conditions. Guardian Australia revealed on Wednesday that Prof Terry Hughes, director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University, concluded the reef had experienced severe mass bleaching in the 2019-20 summer based on his findings from a nine-day aerial survey trip. By Thursday Hughes had assessed more than 800 reefs, covering 344,000 sq km, with another 200 sq km at the southern end to go. He was joined on the trip by an observer from the marine park authority. In a statement, the authority said the accumulation of heat, particularly through February, had caused bleaching across large areas of the reef. The severity of the damage varied widely, but some southern areas that had been spared during mass bleaching events in 2016 and 2017 had now experienced moderate or severe bleaching. It noted there was positive news for the tourism industry: reefs they rely on in the northern and central parts, including near Cairns and Port Douglas, experienced only moderate bleaching, and most corals there should recover. Some pockets of the reef remain unaffected by bleaching. Day 8: Southern nearshore #GreatBarrierReef has widespread, severe #coral bleaching. pic.twitter.com/HspGURBarh The authority said it would have a better understanding of the extent and severity of the bleaching once surveys finished on Friday, with analysis to continue over coming weeks. “Once the aerial surveys are complete we will be able to compare this event to those of 2016 and 2017,” the statement said. It stressed bleached corals would not necessarily die. “On mildly or moderately bleached reefs there is a good chance most bleached corals will recover and survive this event,” it said. “Equally, on severely bleached reefs, there will be higher mortality of corals.” Global heating caused by escalating atmospheric greenhouse gases is a major threat to the world’s coral reef ecosystems. The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found the published evidence suggested a majority of tropical coral reefs would disappear even if heating was limited to 1.5C and would be “at very high risk” at 1.2C. The globe has warmed about 1C since the industrial revolution. About half the reef’s shallow water corals bleached and died in 2016 and 2017. The authority reiterated that climate change was the “single greatest challenge” facing the reef. “While the strongest possible global efforts to reduce emissions are essential, it is critically important we continue to deliver the work already being undertaken to enhance the resilience of the reef,” it said. Environment groups said the mass bleaching underlined the need to move away from fossil fuels. Australian Marine Conservation Society campaigner Shani Tager said the news was devastating for the reef, the species it supports and the communities that rely on its health. She said reef industries reeling from the impact of coronavirus needed short- and long-term support. “When the restrictions from this pandemic lift we will need the beautiful places in this world like our reef more than ever to heal, reconnect with each other and the natural world,” she said. “That means we need a healthy reef and climate policies that will give it a fighting chance.” Kate Smolski, from Greenpeace Australia, said future economic stimulus packages must include measures to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Gavan McFadzean, from the Australian Conservation Foundation, said: “With help, the tourism industry can recover after Covid-19, but only if there is a healthy Great Barrier Reef to visit once this crisis is over.” Specific observations from the aerial surveys include: Inshore and offshore reefs between Tully and Townsville were severely bleached. Offshore areas in the northern section, including highly valued tourism reefs, were more moderately bleached. Inner and mid-shelf reefs between Townsville and Mackay were mostly severely bleached, though some areas used by the tourism industry were only moderately bleached. Bleaching of reefs in the Swains and Pompey groups, at the marine park’s far southeast, was highly variable, with some severe, some moderate and some with minor or no damage."
"**The University of Surrey will drop entry requirements by one grade for most students applying for undergraduate courses next year.**
Grades will be lowered to ""relieve the pressure and anxiety"" for students, who have had their learning disrupted by the pandemic across two academic years.
It is the second institution to make the move within a week.
The government said it will publish plans ""shortly"" on how it will manage disruption to exam pupils in England.
Lizzie Burrows, director of recruitment and admissions at the University of Surrey, said: ""We are taking this action now to relieve the pressure and anxiety facing this year's applicants, as they experience ongoing disruption and uncertainty surrounding exams and assessment of their learning.
""By taking this step, we can provide one additional element of certainty and reassurance that these students will be protected from unfair disadvantage as a result of the impact of the pandemic.""
Regulated courses such as veterinary medicine, foundation year courses, four-year integrated masters programmes and audition-based performance courses will be exempt from the grade reduction, the university said.
Earlier this month, the University of Birmingham became the first higher education institution to reduce entry requirements in recognition of the impact of the pandemic.
For each university course there is an expected threshold in terms of A-level grades, and now Surrey is saying it will accept one grade lower in one subject this year.
So a student applying to study chemistry will only have to reach two Bs and a C at A-level, whereas in previous years it would have been three Bs.
This move by a large university may be an early sign of how flexible universities will be with this year's applicants.
The University of Birmingham has already said it will also be dropping requirements by one grade in one subject.
A-level exams in England are expected to go ahead, and ministers will be under pressure to find a way of recognising that some students have had learning more disrupted than others.
That could prove difficult but a more forgiving approach by universities could compensate."
"**New guidance has been issued to help retailers run a click and collect service in a controlled way during NI's two-week circuit breaker.**
Tougher new Covid-19 restrictions came into force across NI on Friday.
Non-essential retailers have been told to close except for click-and-collect services.
On Friday morning, a framework setting out how these services can be provided safely was published by the Department for the Economy.
The department said click and collect facilities will operate ""on an appointment-only basis with maximum mitigations in place"".
Economy Minister Diane Dodds said the guidance will ""help business owners and customers ensure they are operating safely and within Northern Ireland legislation"".
The framework includes guidance such as:
In other restrictions, cafes and restaurants can only provide a take-away service and close-contact services such as hairdressers and beauty salons have to close.
The restrictions came into force at 00:01 GMT on Friday and will be in place until 00:01 on 11 December.
It means Northern Ireland will revert to similar measures introduced in March, with the exception of schools remaining open.
Garden centres, supermarkets and homeware stores are exempt from closing under the new regulations.
Mrs Dodds has also confirmed that the closing date for applications to Part A and Part B of the Covid Restrictions Business Support Scheme has been extended to 16 December.
She said payments to eligible businesses will be extended to cover the latest restrictions agreed by the executive.
It is hoped the measures, announced by the Stormont Executive, will help control the spread of coronavirus and bring the reproduction (R) number down ahead of the Christmas period.
On Thursday, First Minister Arlene Foster said R number in Northern Ireland was ""just below 1"", but the two-week circuit breaker was ""crucial... so that we can all have the safest and the happiest Christmas possible"".
Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said it was important to reduce the transmission rate to ""as low as possible"" and ""do everything possible to limit the number of people you come into contact with"".
The run-up to the festive period is traditionally the busiest time of the year for the businesses affected by the latest lockdown and the decision has been criticised by retailers and the groups which represent them.

They extended their opening hours this week to cope with the big rise in customers attempting to beat both the lockdown and the Christmas rush.
But they say the new rules over what constitutes essential retail are confusing as a large proportion of the items sold in the shop are homeware.
""All the big retailers like Sainsbury's and Tesco don't close, but they sell the same stuff that we sell. We don't know where we really stand,"" said Mr Mahaffey.
He thinks the other main issue is the timing of the move by Stormont.
""They would have been much better closing us at the beginning of November and letting us re-open now with the run-in to Christmas,"" he said.
""This is our busiest time of the year. The main time is just being taken away from us.""
The doors may be closed to customers, but Christmas stock deliveries are still arriving at shops.
Jenny Doherty, from a book shop shop in Londonderry, is not sure if online sales will be enough to clear that stock and pay the suppliers.
She is not sure yet what the financial hit will be and she said not having customers coming in at this time of year is ""frightening"".
She added: ""Books aren't perishable. There will be a plan B, but I do worry.""
Florist Penny Hamilton is also trialling a click-and-collect service at her east Belfast shop, but is worried it will not suit some of her older customers.
""They are used to coming in and being able to smell all the flowers and see all the colours,"" she said.
""Unfortunately, there is a generation that maybe don't understand, or even have, mobile phones, so it's difficult for them."""

"**It's the run up to a Christmas like no other and we are all trying to figure out what we can and cannot do to get ready, while keeping others safe.**
In Wales, while rules are in place, people can still go to the pub, meet others at a social distance and head out to buy presents.
But from 2 December, across the border in England, about 55 million people will be living under strict rules.
So what do England's tiers mean for those living and working in Wales?
Next Wednesday as the lockdown ends in England, areas will be placed under tiers, from one to three, depending on how high their case rate is.
But while the rules do not apply in Wales, the changes over the border could affect your family, work or business over the coming days.
Regardless of where you live in Wales, coronavirus restrictions have been the same since 9 November.
After the 17-day nationwide lockdown came to an end, the Welsh Government said there needed to be a set of consistent rules, and halted local lockdowns, which had seen people living under varying levels of restrictions.
This means there are no rules on travelling within Wales, but travel into England is banned.
The Welsh Government introduced a ""restricted list of essential purposes"" to allow people to travel between the nations, such as going to work or delivering care.
First Minister Mark Drakeford had previously said a ""similar"" system to that in England could be introduced in the run up to Christmas.
But on Friday Mr Drakeford insisted there were no plans to introduce regionalised ""tiered"" restrictions, similar to those coming into force in England.
He added: ""The advice we have is that a single set of arrangements for Wales works best, is easiest to communicate and delivers benefits in all parts of Wales.""
England's new tier system comes into force when its lockdown ends next week, on Wednesday, 2 December, with Tier 3 being the highest level of restrictions.
Under Tier 3, people must not meet indoors or in most outdoor places with people they do not live with or who are not in their support bubble,.
Pubs and restaurants are closed except for takeaway and hotels and indoor entertainment venues must close.
Areas in the highest tier include most of the north east and West, Yorkshire and the Humber, the West Midlands, and the south West.
With travel across the border banned apart for essential reasons, the changes in England do not in theory change who you can and cannot see.
If you live in Wales and have family and loved-ones in England, you can still visit them if they are in your support bubble, no matter what tier they are in.
But people are being urged not to take that trip unless they have to, with travel in or out of areas in the highest tier - tier three - advised against.
There are exceptions in all of England's tiers for childcare and support bubbles.
If you do travel to visit your support bubble, once in England you will need to follow the rules that apply there.
Scotland has a five-level system that runs from 0 to four.
At Level 3 alcohol sales are not allowed and cafes and restaurants can only serve food and non-alcoholic drinks and must close at 18:00.
With parts of England heading into strict restrictions, you might be wondering what it will mean if you live close to the border of one of these areas.
Bristol and South Gloucestershire, in south West England, are in tier three, meanwhile Cheshire, on the border of Flintshire, is in tier two.
While the Severn Bridge is not closed people are being urged not to travel in or out of these areas, while pubs, bars, cafes and restaurants, have been forced to close.
The tiers could pose a problem for businesses who rely on both Welsh and English custom and people who live and socialise over the border.
For those wanting to drive home to see family and friends to celebrate over the festive period, new rules are being introduced.
From 23 to 27 December people from across the UK will be able to meet.
But with numbers limited to three households, some larger families, and those who have relatives who have separated, this may lead to difficult choices when arranging the dinner table."

Share this...FacebookTwitterToday’s totalitarian ideas are always disguised as righteous plans to ensure “fairness” and “social justice” and they often start in Europe. Then the US Democrats drool over them and scheme to sneak them into the US.
The latest in Europe is to take much more control over the media. German flagship daily the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung has a piece called: EU Advisers Wish To Monitor Media More Strictly. Hat-tip: www.achgut.com/. To what extent this will impact blogs, I have no idea.
A group of EU Commission advisers say, “Europe’s freedom of the press is in danger” and so Europe has to act. Right!
The advisers are calling for stricter state monitoring of the media. According to the FAZ, the group says, “Some media outlets should be financially supported.” And others not?
Anyone living in Europe following the media to any extent knows that Europe’s traditional mainstream leftist media are in dire straits. A number of center-left dailies have recently bitten the dust, and so we suppose they are now looking for generous handouts.
The FAZ writes that stricter monitoring by the EU state would “ensure pluralism and quality”. The group of advisors proposes that the “European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights should monitor freedom of the press and free speech in member states”. You see, today there are media outlets out there who feel their rights to free speech are being infringed because citizens are no longer interested in paying for their crap. Now the government should force citizens to pay for crap that nobody wants – through subsidies.
The advisors also say an “independent monitoring agency“ made up of scientists could be set up. The advisers say that “more pluralism must be achieved, especially in the online media“.

The advisory group is hardly made up of lightweight bureaucrats. It includes former German Justice Minister Herta Däubler-Gmelin (who once compared President George W. Bush to Hitler) and Latvia former President Varia Vike-Freiberga. Däubler-Gmelin for example is calling on Europe to require its member states to have “independent media panels that would impose fines, force counter views, or revoke media licenses”, and to make sure these member-state media panels “abide to European values”. Sounds like free-speech policing to me.
The advisers believe that “freedom of the press is threatened by political powers, excessive commercial power, new business models, changing media landscape and the rise of new media.”
The FAZ writes:
One particularly large problem the advisers find is the creeping loss of quality in reporting, as Ms. Vike-Freiberga showed. Among other things, it arises from the new media like in the Internet where anyone is allowed to disseminate information. “For this reason the group also proposes that it is also essential for the state to support unprofitable media are essential.”
The panels also says that media should comply to a code of conduct and guidelines for publishing.
So, will Obama try again to push through the Fairness Act in USA? Don’t be surprised if he does.

It’s among nearly 30 chemical plants proposed in the U.S. in the next five years, […]. The projects would expand U.S. petrochemical capacity by 27% and employ 200,000 workers at the factories and related suppliers […]. As U.S. natural gas prices soared in the late 1990s, chemical makers moved overseas, laying off 140,000 employees,

Bob Tisdale shows that once again, the devil is in the details.
Guest post by Bob Tisdale
OVERVIEW
This post illustrates Gulf of Mexico Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data and discusses the post by Jeff Masters at his www.wunderground.com blog in which he states that April 2011 Gulf of Mexico SST anomalies are “among the highest on record”, a claim that was then parroted by Joe Romm at Climate Progress. This post will illustrate that the current Sea Surface Temperature (SST) anomalies in the Gulf of Mexico are well below past weekly and monthly record high SST anomalies. It will also show that there is little to no long-term (80-year) trend in the sea surface temperatures of the Gulf of Mexico, a fact that holds true for the three long-term SST datasets (HADSST2, HADISST, and ERSST.v3b) used in global temperature anomaly products.
INTRODUCTION
I, like many, will occasionally drop by Climate Progress to see what Joe Romm is up to. The headline of the post “Masters: Midwest deluge enhanced by near-record Gulf of Mexico sea surface temperatures” caught my eye. Near record? Claims of “near record” and, in the body of the post, “among the highest on record”, give the impression of a long-term increase in Gulf of Mexico SST anomalies. They are clear attempts to imply that there are anthropogenic bases for the “Midwest deluge”. But I’ve studied Gulf of Mexico SST data, and there is little to no long-term trend in the SST anomalies there since the 1930s. So I continued to read Joe Romm’s post.
Romm writes, “Former hurricane-hunter Masters has a good analysis of how the ‘Midwest deluge [is] enhanced by near-record Gulf of Mexico sea surface temperatures…’” I’ll let you decide if it was a “good analysis”. And then Romm includes a quote from Jeff Masters’s post “Tornadoes, floods, and fires continue to pound U.S.”, which reads, “The deluge of rain that caused this flood found its genesis in a flow of warm, humid air coming from the Gulf of Mexico. Sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the Gulf of Mexico are currently close to 1 °C above average. Only two Aprils since the 1800s (2002 and 1991) have had April SSTs more than 1 °C above average, so current SSTs are among the highest on record.” [Bold face by Romm.]
Jeff Masters includes a NOAA/NESDIS-based SST anomaly map as his Figure 5, with a caption that reads. “Figure 5. Departure of sea surface temperature from average for April 25, 2001. Image credit: NOAA/NESDIS.” His Figure 5 is included here as Figure 1.

Figure 1
The entire paragraph about Gulf of Mexico Sea Surface Temperature (SST) anomalies by Jeff Masters at his blog at Weather Underground reads: 
“Midwest deluge enhanced by near-record Gulf of Mexico sea surface temperatures
“The deluge of rain that caused this flood found its genesis in a flow of warm, humid air coming from the Gulf of Mexico. Sea surface temperatures (SSTs )in the Gulf of Mexico are currently close to 1 °C above average. Only two Aprils since the 1800s (2002 and 1991) have had April SSTs more than 1 °C above average, so current SSTs are among the highest on record. These warm ocean temperatures helped set record high air temperatures in many locations in Texas yesterday, including Galveston (84°F, a tie with 1898), Del Rio (104°F, old record 103° in 1984), San Angelo (97°F, old record 96° in 1994). Record highs were also set on Monday in Baton Rouge and Shreveport in Louisiana, and in Austin, Mineral Wells, and Cotulla la Salle in Texas. Since this week’s storm brought plenty of cloud cover that kept temperatures from setting record highs in many locations, a more telling statistic of how warm this air mass was is the huge number of record high minimum temperature records that were set over the past two days. For example, the minimum temperature reached only 79°F in Brownsville, TX Monday morning, beating the previous record high minimum of 77°F set in 2006. In Texas, Austin, Houston, Port Arthur, Cotulla la Salle, Victoria, College Station, Victoria, Corpus Christi, McAllen, and Brownsville all set record high minimums on Monday, as did New Orleans, Lafayette, Monroe, Shreveport, and Alexandria in Louisiana, as well as Jackson and Tupelo in Mississippi. Since record amounts of water vapor can evaporate into air heated to record warm levels, it is not a surprise that incredible rains and unprecedented floods are resulting from this month’s near-record warm SSTs in the Gulf of Mexico.”
ARE GULF OF MEXICO SST ANOMALIES THIS MONTH AMONG THE HIGHEST ON RECORD?
I confirmed with Jeff Masters via WunderGround email that his approximation of a +1.0 deg C anomaly was based on the appearance of the NOAA/NESDIS-based map, not on the data itself. In other words, he looked at the scaling of the color-coded contour levels and estimated the Gulf of Mexico SST anomalies from them. He has compared an assumed DAILY Gulf of Mexico SST anomaly of 1.0 deg C to MONTHLY SST anomalies to arrive at the claim, “Only two Aprils since the 1800s (2002 and 1991) have had April SSTs more than 1 °C above average, so current SSTs are among the highest on record.” Was the Gulf of Mexico SST anomaly for that dataset on April 25th at approximately 1.0 deg C? Looks like it might be. But a one-day SST anomaly snapshot on April 25 does not represent the monthly average for April 2011. There is data available, so there’s no reason to attempt to read the SST anomalies from the temperature contour levels on a map. Since the month of April has not ended and monthly data is not available for it, why not simply use weekly data and average the data that’s available for the month? Why not? As we will see, it doesn’t provide an alarming answer.
The NOAA/NESDIS SST data used by Masters are prepared specifically for the NOAA Coral Reef Watch program. They exclude daytime satellite-based SST observations. This was discussed in my post A Note About SST Anomaly Maps. This is the only SST anomaly dataset that I’m aware of that excludes daytime data. Since the NOAA/NESDIS SST data excludes daytime SST data, and since the NOAA/NESDIS data is not readily available online in an easily usable format, we’ll use the other NOAA satellite-based SST dataset, Reynolds OI.v2, to determine the month-to-date values. Weekly and monthly observations for Reynolds OI.v2 data are available online through the NOAA NOMADS website:
http://nomad3.ncep.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/pdisp_sst.sh?lite=
Figure 2 shows the WEEKLY Gulf Of Mexico Sea Surface Temperature (SST) anomalies from January 3, 1990 (the start of the weekly Reynolds OI.v2 data centered on Wednesdays) through April 20, 2011. I’ve also included the average of the three weekly April 2011 SST anomaly values for the Gulf of Mexico (+0.79 deg C), shown as the red line. (The weekly observations are +0.68 for the week centered on April 6, 2011, and +0.91 for April 13, 2011, and +0.77 for April 20, 2011. Note that they dropped from the second to the third week.) Jeff Masters’s approximation for April is about 0.21 deg C higher than the 3-week average. Also, the weekly data clearly shows that Gulf of Mexico SST anomalies in excess of 0.79 deg C are a common occurrence, and that the elevated SST anomalies occur at differing times of the year. Note the spike in 2002. It occurred in April and May. The highest weekly April 2002 reading was +1.35 deg C, and it occurred during the week centered on April 24, 2002, but the highest April 2011 SST observation so far was only +0.91 deg C. The current April 2011 high is 0.44 deg C lower than the April 2002 high of +1.35 deg C. On a weekly basis, the current Gulf of Mexico SST anomalies are far from the past April record.

Figure 2
But Jeff Masters compared his assumed daily snapshot temperature to monthly data, not weekly data, so let’s examine the MONTHLY Reynolds OI.v2 data from its start year in November 1981. Refer to Figure 3. If we assume the April 2011 SST anomalies for the Gulf of Mexico will be near to the three-week average of 0.79 deg C, then the claim of “near-record warm SSTs in the Gulf of Mexico” is also a stretch. There is a 0.18 deg C difference between the current value and the record high of 0.97 deg C in April 2002.

Figure 3
Let’s also look at a graph of April SST anomalies using the Reynolds OI.v2 data, Figure 4, since Jeff Masters did specify the month of April. The values for 1982 and 2002 were the only times the current SST anomalies were exceeded. And again, there’s the 0.18 deg C difference between the present 3-week SST average anomaly and the record high in 2002. But note that the SST anomalies for the Gulf of Mexico do not exceed +1.0 in 1991 and 2002 as Jeff Masters had written. He also observed that this was the case “since the 1800s”, so he’s obviously comparing his assumed value to a long-term dataset, not a satellite-based dataset like the one in the map.

Figure 4
I tried the long-term HADISST and ERSST.v3b datasets and could not confirm Jeff Masters’s statements in his post, so I asked, and he advised the dataset he used was HADSST2. In summary, he’s compared monthly observations from a ship- and buoy-based SST dataset to an assumed daily snapshot of 1.0 deg C from a satellite-based SST dataset.
I considered stopping the post there. But let’s continue and take a more detailed look at the SST anomalies of the Gulf of Mexico. Let’s assume, similar to the assumption Jeff Masters has made, that the monthly HADSST2 data will be the same as the current 3-week anomaly of the Reynolds OI.v2 data for the Gulf of Mexico. Big assumption. Figure 5 shows the April HADSST2-based SST anomalies for the Gulf of Mexico. They confirm what Jeff Masters had written, which was, “Only two Aprils since the 1800s (2002 and 1991) have had April SSTs more than 1 °C above average…” But the SST anomalies for the month of April have not been reported yet. And the month-to-date SST anomalies for the Gulf of Mexico for April 2011 (based on the three weeks of April 2011 data) are far short of +1.0 deg C. So there’s no reason to compare to 1.0 deg C. Figure 5 also shows that SST anomalies for the Gulf of Mexico as high as (the 3-week average of) 0.79 deg C have occurred regularly, and they have occurred as far back as the 1920s.

Figure 5
NOTE: HADSST2 data is available as far back as 1850, but the source SST data for the Gulf of Mexico is sparse before 1900, leaving multiyear gaps in the data. Refer to Figure 6, which is the output graph created by the KNMI Climate Explorer. I’ve used January 1900 as the start month for the HADSST2 data for this reason.

Figure 6
THE MONTHLY HADSST2 DATA FOR THE GULF OF MEXICO IS REVEALING
Based on HADSST2 data, the monthly SST anomalies for the Gulf of Mexico have exceeded 0.79 deg C many times, even as far back as the early 1900s. Refer to Figure 7. Note also how flat the data has been since the 1930s.

Figure 7
If we start the data in January 1930, Figure 8, we can see the trend in Gulf of Mexico SST anomalies has been basically flat since then. It’s a noisy dataset, but it shows little long-term rise.

Figure 8
Therefore, if the April 2011 Gulf of Mexico SST anomaly should happen to equal or exceed Jeff Masters’s 1.0 deg C guesstimate, it is plainly not a consequence of any long-term (80-year) trend. 
And if we smooth the data with a 13-month running-average filter, as shown in Figure 9, we can see that recent SST anomalies are approximately the same as they were in 1900.

Figure 9
THE RESULTS WITH HADISST AND ERSST.v3b DATASETS
HADSST2 is not the only long-term SST dataset that could be used to determine if the recent warming of the Gulf of Mexico is unusual. The Hadley Centre’s HADISST and NOAA’s ERSST.v3b are also available. Both are infilled, so there are no gaps in the data. That means the entire term of the datasets can be graphed easily. The differences between the ERSST.v3b, HADISST, and HADSST2 datasets are further discussed in the post An Overview Of Sea Surface Temperature Datasets Used In Global Temperature Products.
Figures 10, 11, 12, and 13 provide the same views of long-term data using HADISST data, from January 1870 to February 2011. (HADISST updates are delayed by a month.) As shown in Figures 10 and 11, there are fewer instances in the past when Gulf of Mexico SST anomalies exceeded the 3-week average of the Reynolds OI.v2 data for April 2011, with very few exceeding the assumed 1.0 deg C anomaly. HADISST might have been a better dataset for Jeff Masters to use for an alarmist post, except the HADISST Gulf of Mexico data also shows very little trend since 1930, as illustrated in Figure 12. And Figure 13 shows HADISST Gulf of Mexico SST anomalies that have been smoothed with a 13-month running-average filter. Note the multidecadal variability. I’ll have to compare that with the AMO. For those wondering about the steep decline at the end of the data, it starts in 2008 and should initially be a lagged response to the 2007/08 La Niña. Why didn’t the Gulf of Mexico SST anomalies rise is response to the 2009/10 El Niño? Dunno.

Similar graphs using the NOAA long-term SST dataset ERSST.v3b are included as Figures 14 through 17. ERSST.v3b runs from January 1854 to present. As you will see, it would have been the wrong dataset for an alarmist presentation. Figures 14 and 15 show that Gulf of Mexico SST anomalies were higher in late 1800s than they are today. Figure 16 shows that the linear trend for the Gulf of Mexico SST anomalies is negative since 1930. Nope, alarmists would not like the ERSST.v3b version of the Gulf of Mexico SST data. And the ERSST.v3b data for the Gulf of Mexico shows multidecadal variability quite clearly since 1900.

CLOSING
Jeff Masters’s claim that Gulf of Mexico SST anomalies are “among the highest on record”, which was repeated by Joe Romm, is contrived. It is based on a comparison of a monthly long-term SST dataset to a daily value assumed from the contour levels on a map. The assumed value of 1.0 deg C is 0.21 deg C higher than the three-week month-to-date SST anomalies for the Gulf of Mexico. Short-term satellite-based data show that the Gulf of Mexico SST anomalies are a noisy dataset, with the current anomalies well within the normal range of variability. Long-term SST anomaly data show that the trend of the Gulf of Mexico SST anomalies is flat or negative since 1930. In other words, over that past 80 years, there is no global warming signal in the Gulf of Mexico SST data.

Here’s the reply the reader got from the University of Graz by email today:
Die Karl-Franzens-Universität Graz ist bestürzt und entsetzt über die Ansicht und distanziert sich davon klar und deutlich. Die Universität legt größten Wert, dass die Wahrung aller Menschenrechte zu den obersten Prinzipien der Universität Graz gehört und menschenverachtende Aussagen mit aller Entschiedenheit zurückgewiesen werden. Die Universität weist zusätzlich mit Nachdruck darauf hin, dass eine rein persönliche Ansicht, die nicht im Zusammenhang mit der wissenschaftlichen Arbeit steht, auf universitären Webseiten nicht toleriert wird.
The University of Graz is shocked and appalled by the article und rejects its arguments entirely.

It is somewhat reassuring that the University of Graz is “shocked and appalled” by Prof. Parncutt’s views. But I have one little question: Why was this “inhuman” speech “tolerated” by the University for 2 months!
That is not very reassuring.
Parncutt’s “long list of climate change deniers” , i.e his designated candidates for the death penalty, he links to at the above shown site is happily provided by desmogblog.
Hate speech and this sort of incitement is illegal in some countries. Richard Parncutt and the University of Graz could be open to some serious legal challenges here, especially by those who find themselves on the “long list of climate change deniers” linked at Parncutt’s death penalty page. They may have grounds for a serious grievance here.
If I were on that list, I’d feel pretty damn threatened, let alone pissed off.
Parncutt’s site: http://www.webcitation.org/6D8yy8NUJ.
The only way out I see for the University of Graz is for them to clearly demonstrate that they welcome differing opinions and an open discussion on the subject of climate change. They could start by inviting professors and speakers who have views that differ from those of the IPCC and Prof Parncutt. That is what true academia is supposed to be about.
That’s only for starters.

 ** _Wired for War: The Robotics Revolution and Conflict in the 21st Century_**  
by P W Singer  
The Penguin Press, 2009, ISBN-10: 1594201986, 512 pages 



If you want to understand why Peter Singer’s latest book, _Wired for War: The Robotics Revolution and Conflict in the 21st Century_ , is a tour de force, just consider some headlines from the past month. 



“Study Urges Using Neuroscience to Improve Soldiers’ Performance”

The most fascinating thing about them is not that they are appearing only months after the book’s release, though that will undoubtedly help boost sales. It is that every one of those headlines reflects an aspect of the issue, each of which has its own chapter in the book. They serve as testimonials to the prodigious amount of research and serious reflection on the issue that Singer has done. 



It bears mentioning that Singer, a senior fellow at the Washington, DC Brookings Institute must be making many other scholars gnash their teeth in envy. He is either the luckiest academic on the face of the planet or has an unparalleled sense of coming military trends. If he could discern economic futures as well as he does with military ones he would be giving advice to Warren Buffett and George Soros. 



His 2003 book, _Corporate Warriors_ , examining the realm of private military and security contractors, came out less than six months after the US invasion of Iraq. That book became the gold standard for academic writing and media reporting on the issue. It was also the work which inspired the writing of countless other dissertations and theses on the subject. Although the subject had been covered by others, including myself, before then, his book made firms like Blackwater and Halliburton household words. To this day one can’t read a paper on the subject without seeing a discussion of Singer’s “typology” of the different types of private military contractors. 



That book’s popularity was all the more impressive, considering it was his former PhD dissertation. A type of writing normally known for giving one bleary eyes and splitting headaches. 



After that he wrote a well received book on child soldiers. 



Fortunately, Singer has improved even more as a writer. Stylistically he has lightened up. His copious research is lightened by numerous pop culture references, much of it understandably drawn from science fiction, which is quite understandable, considering his subject is robots. That means references to the like of H G Wells and Jules Verne to Star Trek, Terminator movies, and, of course, Isaac Asimov. And almost all of them are highly informative and amusing. How many people knew that Wells predicted the advent of the atomic bomb? 



Despite the effort to appeal to a broader audience this is not a casual book. It is a very serious book about the future of one of humanities oldest activities, war. And while war and conflict has long been a staple of science fiction the problem, as Singer notes, is that science fiction is turning into science reality. He notes the famous quote by the late English physicist and science fiction author Arthur C Clarke, who wrote the novel _2001: A Space Odyssey_ , and gave us HAL, the malevolent supercomputer (think the artificial intelligence SkyNet from the _Terminator_ movies) that: “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” 



While robots are not magic, the technologies that are on the battlefields today, not to mention those on the drawing boards, are at the limits of human imagination. And perhaps beyond the limits of contemporary ethical and moral limits on the use of force and rules of war. 



Singer has very methodically and dispassionately looked at the past and present and has peered, on the basis of future weapons contracts, peered into the future. What has he seen? The answer is, though he does not put it this way himself is, to quote the tag line from one sci‐​fi movie classic ( _The Fly_ , 1986) is that we should “Be afraid … Be very afraid.” 



Right at the outset, in his author’s note, Singer makes some critical points as to why this subject is important. Given that many people might think this is just another book about “gee whiz” technologies on the battlefield they are worth noting. 



First, “We embrace war but don’t like to look to its future, including now one of the most fundamental changes ever in war.” 



Second, “While we accept change in other realms, we resist trying to research and understand change in the study of war. For example, the very real fear about what the environment will look like as far away as 2050 has driven individuals, governments and companies alike to begin (belatedly) changing their practices. Yet we seem willing to stay oblivious to the changes that will come well before then for war, even though, just like the changes in global climate, we can already see the outlines of the transformation under way.” 



Some of what Singer writes about has been known for years, at least for those who follow military technology issues. These include PackBots, used for explosive ordnance disposal (EOD), made by iRobot, the same firm that produced Roombas, the robotic vacuum cleaner. PackBots can also be equipped with a shotgun. So much for Isaac Asimov’s Three Laws of Robotics, the first of which says robots shall do no harm. 



Another firm, Foster‐​Miller, produced the Talon, a ground robot which comes in EOD, reconnaissance, and hazardous material versions. Its true lethal weapon claim to fame, however, is its SWORDS (Special Weapons Observation Reconnaissance Detection System) version. This is the military version of a Transformer toy; able to carry almost any weapon less than 300 pounds, from automatic rifles and machine guns to grenade launchers and anti‐​tank rocket launchers. 



But is not just quantitative firepower that is remarkable; it is the accuracy and immunity to battlefield chaos. Not being affected by emotional stresses, every weapon it carries is capable of pinpoint precision, turning it into the equivalent of a sniper’s rifle. 



The arming of a system likes SWORDS vastly increases the range of combat military duties it can do, from street patrols and sniping to urban warfare. Considering it can drive through snow or even underwater to a depth of 100 meters feet that means it could show up in the most unexpected places. 



But lethal weapons are not the only kind that robots are being equipped with. There is also ongoing work to equip robots with incapacitating chemical, acoustic, and directed energy weapons (think _Star Trek_ phasers), and lasers. 



Ground robots can come in all shapes and sizes. The MARCBOT (Multi‐​Function Agile Remote Controlled Robot) is essentially a toy car with a video camera. But it has been used to carry anti‐​personnel mines to kill insurgents in Iraq. 



As of last year there were 22 different ground robot systems, over 12,000 in all, operating in Iraq. But robots aren’t just for the army. They operate on the air and sea also. 



Most people today are familiar with the Predator, a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) or drone, which can fly for a day and reach an attitude of 26,000 feet. Their cost of US$4.5 million each is miniscule compared to average cost of today’s fighter or bomber aircraft. More importantly, they can stand stresses that human pilots cannot. Thus, the trend is that pilots will be used less and less. 



After the September 11, 2001 attacks Predators were armed, both by the CIA and the US military with Hellfire missiles, and have carried out thousands of missions, and at least hundreds of armed attacks. 



Aside from the predator there is its bigger brother, Global Hawk, which can stay in the hour for up to 35 hours and reach an altitude of 65,000 feet. 



Systems like these are actually piloted by human controllers working back in the United States. One hour they might be at work firing a missile from a Predator and the next back home eating dinner with the family. That has interesting, to say the least, implications for military professionalism and the warrior ethic. 



There are many other smaller aerial systems, used for reconnaissance, such as the Raven, Shadow and Wasp. Last year, according to Singer, there 5,331 drones in the US military inventory, almost double the number of manned planes. 



Drones are also being used domestically for homeland security and for policing the border with Mexico. 



At sea there is REMUS (Remote Environmental Monitoring Unit) used for clearing mines from waterways. 



In short, increasingly the US military will rely on robots. Even former president George W Bush acknowledged that. “Now it is clear the military does not have enough unmanned vehicles. We’re entering an era in which unmanned vehicles of all kinds will take on greater importance — in space, on land, in the air, and at sea.” To borrow from the world of fashion, military robots are the new black. 



All that just comes from the introductory overview. That is followed by chapters on the history of robots from ancient times to the end of the 20th century, fundamentals of robotics, and exponential change in technological trends. 



In chapter five, things become even more intriguing, and ominous, as Singer looks at the robots of the future, now on the drawing board. SWORDS is scheduled to be replaced by MAARS (Modular Advanced Armed Robotic System). Aside from more powerful weapons, a green laser “dazzler” and tear gas it will have a loudspeaker to warn insurgents that “resistance is futile”. 



And, straight out of Paul Verhoeven’s _Starship Troopers_ , is the REV (Robotic Extraction Vehicle) which will be able to perform complex surgeries on wounded soldiers. Ironically, many of these systems are supposed to come together in the US Army’s Future Combat Systems program, parts of which were recently cancelled after Secretary of Defense Robert Gates suggested cutting the program’s ground vehicle and giant cannon components. He argued that they would not be as useful in the military’s fights against insurgencies in such places as Iraq and Afghanistan. 



At sea there are both unmanned surface and underwater vehicles. Already there is the Spartan Scout, a 30 foot robotic speedboat, packing a .50‐​caliber machine gun. Some of the underwater vehicles mimic marine life, like the Robo‐​lobster, which detects and destroys mines close to shore. 



But it is in the air that the military robot future is advancing the quickest. Already, the Reaper, a successor to the Predator, that is four times bigger and nine times more powerful, is deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. Other drones are being developed for electronic warfare, submarine hunting, and even air‐​to‐​air combat. 



DARPA (Defense Advanced Projects Research Agency) plans to field a VULTURE (Very‐​high‐​altitude, Ultra‐​endurance, Loitering Theater Unmanned Reconnaissance Element) drone, which it hopes will be able to stay aloft for five years at a time. People may recall that when the original _Star Trek_ series aired back in the 1960s the USS Enterprise was on a five‐​year mission. 



Lockheed Martin is pitching a robotic High Altitude Airship 25 times larger than the Goodyear blimp. Such an airship could be parked in the air for years and serve as spy satellite or even airstrip for other planes and drones (like the carrier in _Sky Captain And The World of Tomorrow_ ). 



There are also miniature drones that can eavesdrop into windows or climb up walls and pipes. Someday such systems may reach the nano scale, working at the molecular level, resulting in tiny missiles or nanobots destroying a target from the inside out. 



Singer writes that the air force sees at least 45% of its future large bomber fleet being able to operate without humans abroad. 



And for fighter jocks, like the ones Tom Cruise played in Top Gun, the news is grim. Already there UCAVs (Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicles), such as Boeing’s X-45 or Northrup Grumman’s X-47, which can land on an aircraft carrier. The X-45 was, in fact, so threatening to the US Air Force’s newest manned fighter planes, F-222 and F-35, that the X-45 was canceled, although some believe it still lives on in the classified “black” budget. 



Robot systems are also being envisioned for use in space. The X-41 Common Aero Vehicle is a cross between an intercontinental ballistic missile and the space shuttle. It would give the United States the ability to crush someone anywhere in the world on 30 minutes notice. 



And, as Singer points out, given the increasing number of private companies who are developing space travel capabilities the day may come when they have the ability to conduct military operations on their own. At that point the current private security contractors will have to change their acronym to private space contractors. 



All of this is fascinating, as Spock would say, but it poses profound implications for human control over war. Policymakers always like to toss off sound bites about humans being “in the loop” but there is no reason to think that is always true at present and far more reason to think it will be far less so in the future. In fact we started removing men from the loop in World War 2 with the Norden bombsight and the gap has been growing steadily since. As Singer notes, it is lip service, not reality. 



Already we have systems like the Aegis Defense system aboard US Navy warships which can operate in an autonomous mode, not needing human authorization to fire. And the sheer amount of sensor data that robotic systems generate will certainly be beyond the ability of human operators to assimilate, no matter how enhanced they are with neural implants or other technology. 



Not to mention that the imperatives of warfare are going to make robot autonomy inevitable, if only because once a robot is fired at it is going to need to be able to fire back, without waiting for human approval. 



By the way, that Terminator‐​like humanoid robot on the battlefield future is not far off. Scientists predict 2020 while soldiers predict 2025. 



All of this raises interesting questions. Will robots be vulnerable in the future? Can their communications links and operating systems be hacked? And, if so, what then? 



Or looking at Iraq and Afghanistan are robot systems really going to be effective in fighting insurgencies, where cultural awareness is as important as destructive power. 



And, as the United States increasingly relies on robots what happens when other states and non‐​state actors acquire their own? Already UAVs are widely traded around the world. And, in Iraq, insurgents have captured US robots and used them back against US soldiers. 



In an e‐​mail Singer wrote this is:



Very much a growing field. The Predator and new Reaper variant for instance is being bought by pretty much half of North Atlantic Treaty Organization [nations]. Turkey just put in to buy to use against Kurds for instance. 



So what happens when other countries which are even more advanced in electronics and robotics, like Japan, start investing in military robotics? 



As Singer notes the US is not the only player in this. And, as an early adopter, the US may well be surpassed by other countries which piggyback off US developments. 



Because so much of robotic development is based on open source information their increased use may well hasten the global redistribution of power; not exactly the result that those hoping the use of military robots will allow continued US military hegemony. 



And how does the US military field enough scientifically and technologically adept personnel, when it has trouble attracting sufficient high school graduates, which was the case until the recent recession eased its recruiting problems. 



These are just a few of the questions Singer explores and it takes you barely past the halfway point. 



It is worth remembering that in the history of military technologies those who have wanted to develop something simply because they can have always won over those who questioned whether it should be developed. 



Singer makes it quite clear that the same is occurring with military robotics. If one walks into a lab where such systems are being developed one is going to be greeted with a shrug or a yawn. Right now, such systems are being developed in large part because doing so is “freaking cool”. 



Currently there is already a dangerous divide between the American public and its military. What happens when the fighting is increasingly done by robots operated by “cubicle warriors”? Will policymakers find it even easier to go to war? 



Putting all other questions aside, Singer believes that Murphy’s Law “Anything that can go wrong, will — at the worst possible moment” also applies to robots. 



Given the stakes, that alone is sufficient reason to be having a global debate about the subject. The fact that we are not is itself frightening. 



But for anyone interesting in having the debate Singer’s book is a must‐​read.

From the American Chemical Society something I’ve always wondered about, that soot plays a major role in the Arctic. Controlling soot though, has to start outside of the United States, because soot emissions are already highly regulated by the EPA.
A satellite image shows pollution over eastern China in February 2004. The pollution, consisting mostly of soot and sulfate particles, was created from coal and wood burning and persisted throughout the winter.
Cutting soot emissions: Fastest, most economical way to slow global warming
DENVER, Aug. 31, 2011 — A new study of dust-like particles of soot in the air — now emerging as the second most important — but previously overlooked — factor in global warming provides fresh evidence that reducing soot emissions from diesel engines and other sources could slow melting of sea ice in the Arctic faster and more economically than any other quick fix, a scientist reported here today.

In a presentation at the 242nd National Meeting & Exposition of the American Chemical Society (ACS), Mark Z. Jacobson, Ph.D., cited concerns that continued melting of sea ice above the Arctic Circle will be a tipping point for the Earth’s climate, a point of no return. That’s because the ice, which reflects sunlight and heat back into space, would give way to darker water that absorbs heat and exacerbates warming. And there is no known way to make the sea refreeze in the short term.
Jacobson’s calculations indicate that controlling soot could reduce warming above parts of the Arctic Circle by almost 3 degrees Fahrenheit within 15 years. That would virtually erase all of the warming that has occurred in the Arctic during the last 100 years.
“No other measure could have such an immediate effect,” said Jacobson, who is with Stanford University. “Soot emissions are second only to carbon dioxide (CO2) in promoting global warming, but its effects have been underestimated in previous climate models. Consequently, soot’s effect on climate change has not been adequately addressed in national and international global warming legislation. Soot emissions account for about 17 percent of global warming, more than greenhouse gases like methane. Soot’s contribution, however, could be reduced by 90 percent in 5-10 years with aggressive national and international policies.”
Soot or “black carbon” consists of particles, nearly invisible on an individual basis, released in smoke from combustion of fossil fuels and biofuels. Major sources include exhaust from diesel cars, buses, trucks, ships, aircraft, agricultural machines, construction equipment and the wood/animal dung fires that hundreds of millions of people in developing countries use for used for cooking and heating. Black carbon particles become suspended in the atmosphere and absorb sunlight, just like a black t-shirt on a sunny day. The particles then radiate that heat back into the air around it. Black carbon also can absorb light reflected from Earth’s surface, which helps make it such a potent warming agent.
The good news is that decreasing soot could have a rapid effect, Jacobson said. Unlike carbon dioxide, which remains in the atmosphere for years, soot disappears within a few weeks, so that there is no long-term reservoir with a continuing warming effect. And the technology for controlling black carbon, unlike that for controlling CO2, already is available at relatively modest cost. Diesel particulate filters, for instance, can remove soot from car and truck exhaust. Government and other agencies also are trying to introduce low-soot cookstoves in developing countries. “Converting gasoline- and diesel-burning cars and trucks to electric or hydrogen vehicles and reducing emissions from diesel generators could have an immediate effect on warming,” according to Jacobson.
Jacobson, who developed the first detailed climate model to include the global effects of soot, reported on use of the model to gain new insights into the effects of soot particles trapped inside and between the water droplets that make up clouds. Previous research on black carbon and climate overlooked that topic. Jacobson said the information is important because black carbon within clouds makes the clouds “burn off” and disappear over heavily polluted urban and other areas. Climate models that ignore this “cloud absorption” phenomenon underestimate the effects of black carbon on climate.

ABSTRACT:
Air pollution mortality and global warming are two significant problems today. Over 2.5 million people die prematurely each year worldwide from air pollution. Nine out of the 10 warmest years on record since 1850 were during 2000-2010. The Arctic sea ice extent has dropped 10% (1 million square kilometers) since 1979. Sea levels have risen 1.8 mm/year for the past century but 2.8 mm/year in the most recent decade. In this talk, I provide new results examining the relative contributors to global warming and air pollution health problems. Fossil-fuel and solid biofuel soot particles are found to be the second-leading cause of global warming after carbon dioxide. Whereas fossil-fuel soot is a stronger warmer than biofuel soot, biofuel soot enhances mortality about 8 times more on a global scale, since it is emitted mostly in highly-populated developing countries. Part of the strong climate effect of black carbon is due to its absorption within cloud drops. BC inclusions within cloud drops result in a greater heating rate than the same BC interstitially between cloud drops, and interstitial BC causes more heating than BC in the clear sky. As such, ignoring BC inclusions within cloud drops or between cloud drops results in underestimates of the climate effects of BC. Controlling fossil-fuel and biofuel soot appears to be the fastest method of reducing Arctic ice loss and global warming than any other control option, including control of CH4 or CO2, although all controls are needed.

"In 2008, the European carbon market crashed. Carbon emission allowances in the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) plunged from €30 per tonne of C02 in June 2008 to €7 at the beginning of 2009. Prices have fluctuated around €5 ever since. There is broad consensus on why the price remains low. Partly, it is due to the recession: lower industrial output means less demand for allowances. At the same time, other environmental policies (such as renewable energy and energy efficiency) have been promoted, and this has confused the market. Overarching these factors are the short-term approach to decision making taken by most businesses, which makes it difficult to promote the long-term benefits of environmental investment, and general uncertainty about EU and international emission targets. But is the low price a problem? The answer depends on how you view the objectives of the scheme. Some see the emissions trading as a mechanism established purely to reduce greenhouse gas emissions over time at the lowest possible cost. From this perspective, the current low price is due to the interplay of supply and demand, and there is no need for intervention. Others think the scheme should also provide a clear price signal to support technological innovation. In other words, the carbon price must be high enough to discourage large investments that lock in companies to highly polluting, high-carbon technologies for decades to come. Instead, companies would be encouraged to invest early in low carbon technologies. From this point of view, the current low price is a problem that must be fixed. The debate around emissions trading reform has become polarised and political. The real issue is lack of responsiveness to changing current events in a system designed with decade-long timescales in mind. Unforeseen events, such as a change in economic conditions or new technological developments, can trigger dramatic changes in demand. To function properly, an emissions trading scheme needs to be able to respond to these changes. A responsiveness mechanism may be the answer. The scheme could be adapted to include an override that would lessen the impact of excessive undersupply or oversupply of allowances. Ideally, such a mechanism would be clear and transparent. Clear, so that every buyer and seller in the market is able to understand how it operates. And transparent, with the system data readily available to ensure the mechanism could not be gamed or subject to political lobbying. What are the options? Some stakeholders support the creation of a “price collar” – a price floor to prevent the price falling so low as to discourage innovation, and a price ceiling to cap costs for industries covered by the scheme. This sounds straightforward but it is difficult to set appropriate price thresholds. The price ceiling, in particular, might well be set to protect against only politically unacceptable high prices. Others, including the European Commission, support the creation of a market stability reserve. Here, the commission would automatically add and withhold allowances from the market based on a set of rules agreed in advance. Triggers could be based on various indicators, such as the overall number of allowances in circulation. Depending on the design of the rules, a market stability reserve could be relatively clear and simple to understand. However, for it to be transparent the quantitative data used to determine the triggers should be available to market participants. Price data is readily and continuously observable from the market, but the commission has historically been slow to release quantitative data on allowance usage, and the data has been subject to restrictions. In this context, it is troubling that the European Commission has recently decided to stop releasing information on the extent to which firms use international carbon offsets, where polluting companies buy credits from others who are making emissions reductions in lieu of making their own. While this is part of the system’s normal functioning, the quality of international offset credits purchased from outside the EU ETS – in terms of representing genuine, effective carbon emissions reductions – lacks transparency, and can be dubious or exposed to fraud. The market reserve mechanism will only operate correctly if firms can respond promptly and appropriately to the triggers – and this will require greater system transparency than the commission is providing."
"Carbon emissions from a new coal-fired power station at Collinsville in north Queensland would be comparable to generators built in the state 15 to 20 years ago, according to sources familiar with the proponent’s submissions to the federal government. Guardian Australia has learned the company behind the proposal, Shine Energy, has held discussions about obtaining a concessional infrastructure loan from the federal government via the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility.  In February the government awarded Shine $4.4m to conduct a feasibility study. The grant was broadly considered a concession to pro-coal Queensland Nationals MPs. The new information about the proposal – obtained by sources with knowledge of Shine’s closely guarded business case and other information submitted to the federal government before it was awarded the feasibility study grant – casts doubt on key public claims about the environmental merit and commercial viability of a Collinsville plant. Shine said it could not respond to questions, claiming that details of its proposal were confidential. The company indicated that aspects of the project might have changed since it submitted documentation to the federal government but it would not provide any detail. The company has pitched its Collinsville coal proposal as having the potential to reduce carbon emissions by allowing the closure of higher-emitting power stations elsewhere in the state. But a lack of available water allocation at Collinsville poses a technical challenge for the financing, design and construction of any plant that would emit a lower proportion of carbon, compared with the last generation of coal plants built in Queensland – which has the newest fleet in Australia. Shine has submitted information that shows that by using a dry-cooling system the plant’s emissions intensity would be comparable to the last two plants built in Queensland – Kogan Creek, commissioned in 2007, and Millmerran, commissioned in 2002. Both produce emissions at a rate slightly above .80 tonnes of carbon dioxide per megawatt hour. Sources say Shine’s studies identified it could pollute about 10% to 15% less carbon dioxide if it built a plant with a wet-cooling system, which requires large volumes of water. Plans to build a large dam at the nearby Urannah Creek have been touted as a way to supply water to heavy industry, including a coal-fired power station. But while the Urannah Dam is backed by many of the same political and business interests as the proposed power station, it is bitterly opposed by local Indigenous traditional owners, including Shine Energy and some of its directors. The Shine Energy chief executive, Ash Dodd, told Guardian Australia in February that the power generator proposal would not rely on the Urannah Dam. “We as Birri and Widi traditional owners stand opposed to the [Urannah Dam] project as it will have a major environmental impact on our sacred rivers and all water rights belong to our people.” Richie Merzian, the climate and energy director at the Australia Institute, said the federal government had spent $1.3bn attempting to improve the emissions intensity of coal since 2003. “It is damning that the best technology they can find now has the same emissions intensity as plants built 15 years ago,” Merzian said. “If the best they can do is build another plant like Kogan Creek, it will do little for reliability, given this plant is the most unreliable on the grid per unit of energy.” Dodd has raised the prospect that Collinsville could allow for the closure older, dirtier plants, including the privately operated Gladstone power station (.95 tonnes CO2 per MWh), though the Queensland government is firmly opposed to that suggestion and Gladstone has commercial energy supply contracts running until 2029. The state’s opposition to the Collinsville plant could also prove problematic for Shine in its efforts to obtain finance. In interviews, Dodd has said the company has held discussions with overseas-based investors and would apply for Naif financing. Guardian Australia understands Shine is pursuing a concessional federal loan from the Naif program, which it expects could then catalyse additional interest from private investors. The Queensland government holds an effective veto over any Naif loan to a project in the state. A Naif spokesman said it “cannot comment on whether or not it has been approached by particular entities in respect of particular projects”. Shine Energy’s shares are worth $1,000 on paper and the company will require about $2bn in outside financing to build the power generator. In addition to seeking Naif funding, Shine has applied for federal government underwriting against potential future losses. It was not named among shortlisted projects for a federal energy underwriting program. Energy sector analysts say the extent to which Shine has asked for government subsidy should dismiss outright any suggestion that a coal-fired power station at Collinsville could be independently viable. “Large subsidies are the only way they can get it up and running,” said Tim Buckley, the director of energy finance studies at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. “It’s a project that’s entirely unbankable by any private financier. It’s 100% an ideological exercise, there’s no commercial viability.” Shine’s director of marketing and communications, Kelli Cohen, warned Guardian Australia against printing “inaccurate information” but said the company “can not respond” to any aspect of this story due to commercial confidentiality. This is despite Dodd previously speaking about emissions intensity, potential funding sources, government subsidies and other technical details in interviews on Sky News. “You have not been given an up to date project brief from your source,” Cohen said. Shine did not respond to subsequent attempts to clarify what details might have changed."
"**Aberdeen is not a Covid hotspot yet the pressure on hospital and intensive care staff is still starting to show.**
The patient count at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary (ARI) is not as high as some of Scotland's worst-hit hospitals but numbers are increasing.
We spent less than an hour in ""pod 1"" of ARI's Covid ICU and it was a total reality check on the effect of the second wave of the virus.
Eighty-three-year-old Meg Thomson is one of 11 patients being treated there.
Against the constant hiss of oxygen and the beeping of monitors, Meg tells me she doesn't know where she contracted the virus or how she ended up in ICU but, with grit and stoicism, she is determined to get better.
""I dinnae give up very easily,"" she says. ""I've got my ups and downs but I feel positive.""
In the neighbouring bed, 65-year-old Dot Bright says she started feeling unwell just over a week ago. After deteriorating rapidly, she was admitted to the ICU.
""The night before I was brought in here, I thought I was finished,"" she says
""It's the biggest scare I've had in my life. Take it serious.""
In the last month, the number of Covid patients in hospital have doubled and the staff in ICU know that means there will be more needing critical care in the next few weeks.
Working 12-hour shifts in visors, gloves, gowns and masks is hot and uncomfortable.
Every time you enter or leave ""the pod"" the protracted routine of donning and doffing must take place. And that goes for the nurses and doctors as well as domestic staff bringing in equipment or taking the bins away.
Chloe Burdett has been an ICU nurse for three years and she says everyone is tired and trying to stay motivated.
""To know that people are so unwell, when we thought we'd gotten over that, it's very difficult to see that again and know it's still out there and it's still a threat to everyone,"" she says.
Helen Paddon, the head nurse for critical care, says it has been the most difficult year of her nursing career.
""The nursing staff are working longer hours than they should do, in full PPE,"" she says.
Staff here say they have been lucky to escape the full impact of the second wave felt in other parts of Scotland.
But a specialist national unit, which is based in the Aberdeen ICU, means they treat some of the sickest Covid patients in Scotland.
The ECMO (Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) unit, ""pod 2"", has special machines that take on the work of the lungs. It is often the younger people who will be put on ECMO as they are the most likely to survive.
Dr Iain Macleod heads up all the hospital's critical care. He tells me that better treatments this time mean more people can avoid intensive care but those who do come tend to stay for some time.
""What we're seeing this time is more of a slow burn, patients are here for longer, they remain very sick,"" he says.
And like all hospitals this time round, other work continues.
For the critical care team that means running and staffing two intensive care units, one for Covid patients and one for non-Covid.
""Intensive care is an emotionally-charged environment but this year is like nothing I have ever seen before,"" Dr Macleod says.
""Our team have been working incredibly hard over the last six months and there is no end in sight.""
Visiting is not allowed in order to limit the number of people in the hospital but I was granted rare access, alongside a camera operator, because the staff felt it was important that people understood just how serious the threat of this virus is.
And it is distressing to see.
Dot and Meg have turned a corner but there are others in the unit who might not make it.
The staff have to deal with that and they have to deal with working in full PPE, getting used to smiling with their eyes as they comfort frightened patients.
They also have to deal with their own fears of the virus, their own stresses of seeing people so critically ill, and taking that home at the end of a busy shift to everyday family life.
Dot tells me: ""The people in here can't be more helpful. They stand here for four or five hours without a break. They're here with you all the time."""

Excerpt from Mann’s (erroneous) legal complaint against National Review and the Competitive Enterprise Institute. Source: http://legaltimes.typepad.com/files/michael-mann-complaint.pdf
National Review here now writes Mann has a lot of corrections to make:
But, behind the scenes, a lot of quiet airbrushing of the record seems to be going on. Two days ago, his Penn State bio said he had been “co-awarded” the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize, now merely that he “contributed… to the award” (whatever that means). Over at Wikipedia, they’re arguing over ever more unwieldy rewrites. Editing an inaccurate legal complaint is trickier but by now someone may have snuck into the DC court clerk’s office with a gallon of White-Out and amended “defamation of a Nobel prize recipient” to “defamation of a man who received one of two thousand photocopies of a commemorative thank-you certificate run off at the IPCC branch of Kinko’s”.
Read the whole story at the above mentioned link. Personally I like the title of the story :).
For European readers who may not know, Kinko’s is a famous chain of copy shops in the USA and “White-Out” in Germany is known as Tippex.

From the AGU today, I find they are moving the cause of ancient planetary disaster from comets impacts and volcanoes or other big events to CO2 causing acidification of the oceans, literally they have a blast from the gas, to make CO2 the villain here. Of course, it’s just another modeling exercise in uncertainty.
The Permian–Triassic (P-Tr) extinction event is the most significant extinction event in this plot for marine genera. Source Wikipedia
From Wikipedia, a clear cut case of “we don’t know“:
There are several proposed mechanisms for the extinctions; the earlier phase was likely due to gradual environmental change, while the latter phase has been argued to be due to a catastrophic event. Suggested mechanisms for the latter include large or multiple bolide impact events, increased volcanism, and sudden release of methane clathrate from the sea floor; gradual changes include sea-level change, anoxia, increasing aridity, and a shift in ocean circulation driven by climate change.
From the AGU Highlights:
1. Was ocean acidification responsible for history’s greatest extinction?
Two hundred and fifty million years ago, the world suffered the greatest recorded extinction of all time. More than 90 percent of marine animals and a majority of terrestrial species disappeared, yet the cause of the Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB) die-off remains unknown. Various theories abound, with most focusing on rampant Siberian volcanism and its potential consequences: global warming, carbon dioxide poisoning, ocean acidification, or the severe drawdown of oceanic dissolved oxygen levels, also known as anoxia.

To narrow down the range of possible causes, Montenegro et al. ran climate simulations for the PTB using the University of Victoria Earth System Climate Model, a carbon cycle-climate coupled general circulation model. The model’s highlights include dynamic representations of terrestrial vegetation, ocean carbon fluxes, and net primary production. The researchers ran nine simulations, using three different concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide, three modes of ocean floor topography, and two competing theories for the geography of the time.
The authors find that varying the ocean floor topography by adding deep ocean ridges increases the strength of the Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC) – a convective cycle that mixes ocean waters. Also, the presence of the MOC was not abated by elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide as was found in previous research, suggesting that the ocean would have been well mixed and well oxygenated, restricting the chances of widespread deep ocean anoxia.
Further, the researchers find that if atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations were 3000 parts per million by volume or higher, fitting within estimates for the Permian-Triassic boundary, the ocean pH would have been 7.34 or lower. At those levels, the authors say the ocean’s acidity would have had significant negative impacts on mollusks, corals, and other species that rely on oceanic calcium carbonate, suggesting ocean acidification may have been the main culprit in the Permian-Triassic boundary extinction.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSomeone please tell us where’s the warming
By Frank Bosse and Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
The Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) has released the global mean temperature figure for 2012. The anomaly is +0.56° Celsius. A look at the last 30 years (a climate-relevant time-period) shows a global temperature stagnation:

Temperature anomaly (in hundredths of a degree) from 1983 to 2012.
This has created a commotion in the media. Spiegel has taken notice and reported of “puzzled scientists”. Perhaps we can lend them a hand in finding the missing heat. The 5-year moving average has been flat since 2002 – a full decade. There really hasn’t been any significant increase since 1997; that’s 16 years. James Hansen (see our blog report: “Who is James Hansen?“), released the temperature data while publishing an enlightening paper (Hansen et al. 2013, pdf). In it he acknowledges the temperature rise stop and attributes it mainly to the effects of natural variability. Global ocean heat content (OHC) of the upper 700 meters has also flattened, especially since 2004:

Therefore it is argued that since the beginning of the millenium the heat must have been transported to the ocean depths, down to 2000 meters. However, from those depths, little data is available. As a whole, everything appears vague and imprecise. Yet, there is something we wish to take a closer look at. Question: Where could this have possibly taken place? Here’s a look at the heat content (down to 700 m depth) of the Southern Hemisphere:

 
Here the trend is uninterrupted. There’s been no change in trend since 1990. Now let’s take a look at the Northern Hemisphere:

 
Here nothing has warmed in the last 10 years (see our blog article “A look at the global mean temperature in 2013. Is cooling ahead!“). In the meantime, this is what we have found, also published at climate website climate4you:

 
The above is the Ocean Heat Content (OHC) of the North Atlantic above 30° north, which is also known as the AMO region, which is where the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation takes place. The dataset shows the anomaly from the detrended sea surface temperatures (SST). A look at the region of impact shows that a huge area of the Northern Hemisphere is impacted:

google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";
google_ad_width = 200;
google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




 
Depicted above is the correlation of the AMO region with the global temperatures (positive correlation in orange, red violet). In the Northern hemisphere large regions are effected: USA, Central America and all of Europe, up to the Urals and also the Far East. In the Southern Hemisphere there’s practically no correlation! There the AMO does not play a role. What’s the relationship to ocean heat content (OHC)?

 
The above chart shows how the course of the OHC, whose magnitude in the North Atlantic has been dropping since 2004, correlates with the entire OHC of the Northern Hemisphere since 2004. The “cold colors” show the areas of water that behave like or similarly to the North Atlantic, i.e. in decline. In regions where warm colours rule, OHC is rising and thus counters the North Atlantic.  In the ocean regions where the AMO has an effect (see the preceding chart ), OHC behaves like the North Atlantic. Only the Northeast Pacific is out of sync. Here a negative phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation has been in play for quite some time now. OHC in the North Pacific also has not been doing much since the year 2000:

 
The decline in OHC in the Northern Hemisphere could be well connected to the effect of the AMO. The flattening out of the OHC is very likely an AMO signal, which began to decline in 2005. Or is the North Atlantic being massively impacted by the anthropogenic aerosols (which are often used as an explanation) to explain the AMO? This is likely not the case because the chart showing the distribution of tropospheric aerosols indicates that the North Atlantic is one of the regions of the Northern Hemisphere that is impacted the least.

Figure from Shindell 2007.
So here it’s likely that the thermohaline circulation is offsetting the temperature driving greenhouse gas effects. If the early phase of the falling AMO has been able to offset the effect of anthropogneic greenhouse gases for years, then the rising AMO’s impact on temperatures during the period of 1975 to 1997 had to have been half of the entire observed warming during the period.  This would have profound consequences for the prognoses: The effect of the greenhouse gas was only 50% responsible for the warming since the intensive industrialization since 1960.
Implicitly, maybe late – but not too late – the British MetOffice recognized this as it recently corrected its prognosis for the coming years (see blog article “The avalanche gathers speed: British Weather Service drastically reduces its warming prognoses until 2020“). It concedes the effect when it explains: “In this case, changes in ocean surface temperatures in some parts of the world over the past year are understood to have made a key contribution to the difference between the 2011 and 2012 forecasts…”.
Therefore we should prepare for a long phase of stagnation if the AMO continues falling for decades. This is even simulated in a little known paper (Wouters et al. 2012). The authors are able to reporoduce the variability without the anthropogenic influence.
Summary
Temperatures have been flat for more than 10 years and the OHC of the North Atlantic reached its peak 7 years ago. We have shown that global temperatures follow the OHC there (see: “A preview of global mean temperature in 2013: Cooling ahead!“). We now see that the temperature course over the years followed the OHC, in harmony with the AMO. Cycles, particularly the oceans, were always suspected in the IPCC reports. Such cycles, however, are obvious and lead to the conclusion that manmade greenhouse gases are only 50% responsble for the warming. The impact of the thermohaline circulation on the climate is a key to understanding climate change and to what we can expect in the years ahead.
Another key is the sun. If a Maunder-type of minimum occurs, then we will certainly not see any temperature increase of the type vehemently postulated in the IPCC reports. These are exciting times – stay curious!

Share this...FacebookTwitterUPDATE: This story has only been confusion. It appears the new record was never set. Now it seems the source has been the Daily Mail, a story they wrote in January. Other outlets picked up on it, and information seems to have gotten lost and changed along the way. The Mail writes the -71.2°C reading was taken in 1924. But I guess it never became official, or something.
My conclusion: Nobody knows what the record temperature in Siberia really is. Someone else can work on it. I’m finished with this story!
==============================
Russia is a country filled with mystery and tales. Yesterday I wrote here there were reports that a new record low temperature had been set for the northern hemisphere, in Oymyakon, Siberia: -71.2°C.
However that record remains unconfirmed so far. But media outlets have been reporting on it, examples:
Public Post.ru/:
Село Оймякон — самая холодная точка на планете. На днях тут похолодало до минус 71 градуса — это самая низкая температура за всю историю измерения. Предыдущий рекорд был в 1933 году, когда ударил мороз минус 67,8 градусов.
In English (Bing translation):
The village of Oymyakon is the coldest point on the planet. The other day here it became colder to minus 71 degrees is the lowest temperature ever measured. The previous record was in 1933, when the frost hit minus 67.8 degrees.”
borlife.de reports here:

Oymyakon: Coldest Town in the World – 71 ° Celsius
It was just a few days ago that Oymyakon became famous. With -71° Celsius, it recorded a new record cold temperature, which until then had been unique to 2 villages. Until then the record of -68°C had to be shared with the town of Werchojansk – however, this is now history.”
Meteo Portale Italia:
Un nuovo record di freddo è stato stabilito nella giornata di oggi in Siberia. Nella città di Oymyakon è stato raggiunto l’incredibile valore di -71°C! Battuto il precedente record di -68°C che resisteva ormai dal lontano 1933. Tutta la Siberia e la Russia stanno sperimentado una fase di gelo intenso, con -50°C toccati anche nella regione di Dzalinda.”
In English, that’s something like:
A new record cold was recorded today in Siberia. In the town of Oymyakon the incredible value of -71.2°C was reached, beating the record of -68°C set in 1933. All of Siberia and Russia are in a phase of intense frost. with -50°C in the region of of Dzalinda.”
Germany’s Die Welt:
The Siberian location of Oymyakon has broken the record for the lowest temperature of all time. With -71°C it is the coldest town in the world. Even the traffic signs are iced over.”
Record? So far no one has been able to confirm it officially.

And John Armstrong says it as if it is a bad thing?



Media attacks on the ACT Party suggest to me that David Seymour is gaining some traction. I’ve heard Heather du Plessis Allen dismiss ACT’s recent rebranding exercise as a non-event, yet the media reported on it. Now John Armstrong is saying that ACT is out of step with the rest of New Zealand’s political class. 



What Armstrong pretends he does not realise, is that a small party **has** to have a point of difference, or no one will vote for it at all. When it comes to freedom of speech and also the euthanasia debate, Seymour is striking a nerve and, clearly, John Armstrong doesn’t like it. 



However, it is going to take a lot more than yet another redesign of the party’s logo to breathe fresh life into an outfit which captured less than 1 per cent of the overall party vote at the last general election and which on current opinion poll ratings has yet to give any cause for optimism that it will do better at next year’s contest. 



But maybe the fact that _Newshub’s_ poll showed that the majority of people are concerned about a loss of free speech will do it for ACT, eh John?



If the party is ever going to shift out of intensive care and into the recovery ward, it needs to undertake a top-to-bottom review of its driving ideology.  
The party is seriously out of sync with New Zealand’s political culture. Despite being slaughtered at the ballot box time and time again, ACT party still expects everyone else to adapt to its vision of how the world ought to be. 



Well, ACT is still there, John, unlike United Future, the Maori Party, Mana, the Internet Party, the Alliance, the Progressive Party and the Conservative Party; so maybe enough people have adopted their vision to keep them alive thus far at least.



ACT is completely out of touch. Look no further than the party’s unrelenting advocacy of a flat tax. If there is one thing which really worries New Zealanders, it is the growing gap between the rich and the poor. ACT’s answer is for the rich to pay even less tax than they do now. Little wonder the party cannot seem to connect with the electorate. 



A flat tax is ACT core policy; it dates back to the days of Roger Douglas. John obviously buys into the mantra about forcing the ‘rich’ to pay more tax, completely forgetting that large swathes of the ‘poor’ pay no tax at all.



Seymour deserves some credit for drawing together the party’s policies under a common theme of promoting freedom.



This only succeeds in bringing to mind deck chairs and Titanics, however.



This is an angry little piece by John Armstrong who, seeing himself as part of the socialist elite, has no fear of losing freedoms himself; but he is damned if the ordinary man in the street is going to have them. All thinking people should at least consider Seymour’s position on free speech. Armstrong is clearly not a thinking man.



The brute reality of ACT’s predicament is that the party has long been propping up the bar at the Last Chance Saloon. Time is about to be called, however. 



Along with all of the climate change zealots, Armstrong claims to know what is going to happen in the future – specifically at the next election. I must check my Lotto numbers with John.



Having failed to transform his party, Seymour is transforming himself.  
He is seeking to tap into the mountain of moral conservatism in the New Zealand electorate.  
He is sounding more and more the populist, if still a highly unlikely one. He is no Winston Peters — and never will be of that calibre. 



Some of us don’t rate Peters particularly highly, except to say that he is a survivor. To say that David Seymour is ‘no Winston Peters’ is no insult to Seymour, even though it is meant to be.



Take Seymour’s flagging of his intention to derail Labour’s fast-tracking of an assessment of whether a law specifically banning “hate speech” ought be added to the statute books. 



Seymour would never admit, but **the stance he is taking is designed to gain him kudos with those of an anti-Islamist bent** and who bristle at the prospect of New Zealand laws being written — in their misguided view — by and for an alien minority. 



**Seymour can be accused of racism**. But it is hard to make such a charge stick. ACT’s leader can respond by saying he is only doing what ACT has always done, namely fighting against attempts to curb free speech. 



When in doubt, pull the race card. Seymour is not being racist. Freedom of speech is, again, a core ACT policy.



Likewise take Seymour’s call for the abolition of the Human Rights Commission as a further example of how he is trying to connect with less enlightened voters. 



**He is targeting those voters who fume at what they regard as political correctness.**



  
Which is why I like him…and which is also why, contrary to John Armstrong’s blinkered opinion, more and more people are sitting up and taking notice of ACT. Many of us are sick to death of political correctness. It is a cancer in our society.



John rambles on and on in his article, but to me, one thing is clear. **The media is getting worried about the ACT party.** Instead of ignoring it, as they have done up to now, they have chosen to denigrate it. But never forget the old adage – it doesn’t matter what they are saying about you, so long as they are talking about you. And the media is talking about ACT right now.



This article saddens me for another, very important reason though. When journalists rally against politicians who are in favour of free speech, your society is in trouble. John Armstrong might well want to think about that. After all, although he clearly doesn’t realise it, his own freedoms are under threat too.

"There has been an anxious search for new sources of fossil fuels, and shale gas appears to offer Britain a key national resource. But the nation’s new-found hydrocarbon wealth has met with far from universal approval. The first company to be granted a licence to drill for shale, Cuadrilla, found itself in the Battle of Balcolme last summer as environmental activists and Sussex villagers clashed with police over the drilling site. There are now only 12 months to go before a general election. With the coalition government keen to make the most of Britain’s reserves, public opinion of fracking could be important to the outcome of the next election. Advocates describe shale gas as “game-changing”, able to radically reduce Britain’s reliance on imported fuel and cut household energy costs. But opponents state the process of fracking – blasting water underground at high pressure to shatter rocks and release gas – is risky and environmentally damaging with little-understood health risks. Many Conservatives appear to be highly supportive of the “dash for shale”, while others worry about the voting implications of drilling in Tory shire county strongholds. Although Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg offered cautious support last year, prominent Liberal Democrats have distanced themselves. Labour’s position is more difficult to decipher, with elements of support and staunch opposition. Former Conservative energy minister Lord Howell this week repeated his comments of last year that fracking should go ahead in the “desolate” north, avoiding at all costs the Tory strongholds of the southern counties. Evidently, the lack of consensus between and within the parties on fracking means that any dash for shale gas is some way off yet. As part of our project examing climate change as a complex social issue, my colleagues and I examined how the issue is framed socially and politically by looking at how fracking is presented in the British broadsheet press and in British public opinion polls.  Our analysis of the UK media’s reporting of fracking revealed occasions when it was heavily split between those against (The Guardian and Independent) and those for (The Times and Telegraph). Reported in April 2011, the Gasland documentary film followed the experiences of residents affected by fracking in the US including memorable scenes of setting fire to gas-infused tap water. In April 2011, Cuadrilla’s fracking in Lancashire caused a seismic event. In both cases, a clear divide was seen, with pro-fracking outlets refering to “seismic activity” or “tremors”, and anti-fracking outlets referring to “earthquakes”, or rubbishing the facts or motives of the Gasland film. We should not lose sight of public opinion among the rhetoric in the newspapers. My colleagues and I have been conducting survey research via YouGov in order to gauge the British public’s perceptions of fracking, conducting six large surveys since 2012. Interestingly, respondents overwhelmingly endorsed fracking in Britain. But the trend of growing support for and declining opposition to fracking was reversed in July 2013, perhaps as a consequence of the considerable coverage of the altercation in Balcolme, and the strong explanations of the risks involved. If it is the case that, on the whole, the British public is open to the prospect of fracking, why is this the case, and why are they supportive despite the representations of risk in the media?  I have argued that love of lifestyle may outweigh fears over fracking. Human beings generally resist change, try to maintain a sense of continuity and control. Fracking, with its promise of cheap, secure energy, may be viewed as a means to this end, with the risks downplayed. Of course, this is very much dependent on the sorts of messages found in the media and the mouths of politicians. What our work shows is that the way fracking is framed, socially, linguistically, ideologically, is pivotal in shaping the debate. These framings shape our risk perceptions and tell us how we should act, and can persuade us towards one position or another despite the potential risks or benefits.  Essentially, both the pro- and anti-fracking camps are engaged in a struggle of representation. While one camp constructs the practice of fracking as excessively risky, the other camp minimises, normalises and justifies the risks.  There is much political ambivalence about fracking, with no single major political party having taken a firm party-wide stance on the technology. However, with growing public endorsement, it may be the case that the major political parties will view fracking as something that the British public wants and, ultimately, will vote for. "

When China completed its 15‐​year accession process and joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001, it was a rising power, but still clearly a developing country. Its GDP per capita was $3,227,1 and its share of global trade was only 4 percent.2



By 2015, however, its GDP per capita had risen to $14,450, and its global trade share to 11.9 percent. As China’s economic power has increased, so has criticism of its market‐​distorting economic practices. The U.S. government has brought international trade complaints against China and used unilateral actions and threats, but U.S. businesses are unsatisfied with the results. While there have been some successes, the limits of the current approach to making China’s economy more market‐​oriented may have been reached, as there are gaps in the existing international trade rules, and unilateral demands are of limited value against a powerful trading partner with its own domestic politics to contend with. Moreover, in the current political climate, an overly aggressive approach runs the risk of a serious U.S.-China trade war, which would cause great harm to both sides.3



But there is another option. If the United States wants to promote the liberalization of Chinese trade and investment policy, it needs to engage with China in a more positive way. To this end, it should sit down with China and negotiate a new economic relationship, one that goes beyond the terms of the WTO. In particular, the United States should initiate formal negotiations on a trade agreement with China. Negotiations of this kind will be a challenge, especially with a president who has been so critical of China. However, negotiations offer the best hope for addressing concerns about China’s economic policies and practices.



 **Using Trade Agreements to Liberalize the Chinese Market**  
Promoting liberalization in China through a trade negotiation would not be unprecedented. The first effort to use trade agreements in this way was the WTO accession process. The WTO contains a number of key obligations that have helped open China’s market to foreign competition. To start with, through commitments to lower tariffs, China’s simple average tariff rate came down from 15.9 percent to 9.7 percent.4 Beyond tariffs, the WTO includes detailed rules on disguised protectionism, so if China uses taxes, product regulations, or food safety standards as a way to favor domestic producers, countries can challenge such practices. The WTO also has strong rules on subsidies, border restrictions, intellectual property protections, commitments to open services markets, and disciplines on trade remedy measures. Since 2004 the United States has filed 21 WTO complaints against China on the basis of these and other obligations. According to a December 2015 report by the U.S. Trade Representative’s Office, of the 17 complaints brought as of that time, 9 resulted in litigation wins, and others were resolved successfully without full litigation, with 3 still in progress.5



Of course, not all WTO litigation victories result in actual market opening. The WTO can do only so much to induce recalcitrant governments to comply. It should be noted that some of the responsibility for enforcement lies with the complaining governments. In two prominent cases (on electronic payment services and on distribution services for books, movies, and music) in which China has been criticized for insufficient compliance, the United States has not pursued enforcement as fully as it could have.6



Under the WTO’s dispute procedures, after an adverse ruling, if a complainant believes the respondent has not complied properly, it can bring a follow‐​up complaint. If the measure in question is still in violation of the rules, the complainant can then request authorization to impose trade sanctions. The United States has not taken any of these steps in these cases. The Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) offered an opportunity to fill in some of the gaps in the WTO’s coverage by opening markets beyond what has been achieved at the WTO. China was not a party to the TPP talks, but it was often mentioned as a possible candidate for accession. As part of this accession process, the United States could have demanded that China (1) take on obligations to lower tariffs, (2) ensure that its state‐​owned enterprises (SOEs) act in accordance with commercial considerations, and (3) strengthen its intellectual property protections. However, now that President Trump has withdrawn the United States from the TPP, the opportunity to use it as a tool to promote liberalization in China is gone.



Without the TPP or other regional trade initiatives, and with no comprehensive talks going on at the WTO, the best way for the United States to promote market liberalization in China is to go directly to China and negotiate bilaterally on issues related to Chinese restrictions on trade and investment. In the past, there have been discussions between China and the United States on a number of issues, but most of these talks have been merely “dialogues” that did not lead to concrete results. What is needed instead is a formal negotiation that leads to enforceable commitments. With so many trade and investment issues to address, the task of negotiating may sound daunting, but keep in mind that other countries have already completed deals with China. Australia and New Zealand both have free trade agreements with China, signed in 2015 and 2008 respectively. In addition, Canada completed an investment agreement with China that entered into force in 2014 and has announced that it would explore the possibility of trade negotiations as well.



 **Negotiating U.S.–China Trade and Investment Agreements**  
There is little doubt that talks between China and the United States would be more complex and contentious than China’s deals with other countries, but they will not be impossible. It will just take creativity, resolve, and the willingness of both sides to compromise. If we were starting from scratch today, we might deal with both trade and investment together, as modern trade agreements usually do. However, trade and investment issues were originally dealt with in separate international negotiations, and there is an existing U.S.-China investment negotiation that has been ongoing for almost a decade. (During the Obama administration, President Xi and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew both expressed hope that the talks would be concluded, but that did not happen.)7



For the sake of continuity, it may make sense to keep the investment and trade aspects separate. In addition, it can be simpler to divide issues into smaller, more manageable packages. At the same time, there are a number of considerations that point to a unified approach that deals with all the issues at once: the Trump administration may prefer to set its own path rather than carry over an Obama negotiation; some of the issues fall within both the trade and investment categories; an investment treaty will require the support of two thirds of the Senate, which might be harder to obtain in the current anti‐​China political climate than the simple majority needed for a trade agreement; and a broader trade agreement could include more issues, which would make it possible to bring in support from a wider range of interest groups. On balance, a single agreement covering both trade and investment makes the most sense at this time.



However the negotiators decide to proceed, the key will be the substance of the agreement. For both trade and investment, there are a number of long‐​standing issues for negotiators to discuss. On investment, there are sectors of the Chinese economy that are still closed to investment, there are many requirements imposed on foreign investors, and there have been allegations that China is using its anti‐​monopoly law against U.S. business in an abusive way. And on trade, some of the main issues are high tariffs, regulatory barriers, services trade barriers, noncommercial behavior by state‐​owned enterprises, weak intellectual property protection, cyber theft and security, and allegations of currency manipulation.



The two main investment‐​related issues are restrictions on foreign investment in particular sectors and certain types of performance requirements imposed on foreign investors. On the former, the Chinese market is often restrictive toward foreign investment, with nearly 100 sectors still having barriers.8



China’s latest liberalization proposal covered about 40 sectors but fell short of U.S. demands.9 One area where the United States could push for more access is the finance sector. China’s State Council released a statement earlier this year that it would open up this sector to foreign investment, but did not provide further details. Negotiations on this issue could push China to act more quickly in this regard.



Even in the sectors to which foreign investors do have access, there are sometimes performance requirements imposed by the Chinese government that hinder the investors’ operations. One example is that China has demanded that investors turn over their technology to local partners. A trade agreement can impose constraints on China’s use of such requirements.



China’s application of its anti‐​monopoly law to foreign investors is another concern of the American business community. These issues could be addressed in a trade agreement, perhaps by focusing at the outset on basic principles such as transparency and due process in China’s application of this law.



Turning to trade, a fundamental issue is the imbalance in tariffs. As President Trump himself has said, “we’re being hurt very badly by China … with [China] taxing us heavy at the borders when we don’t tax them.”10 China’s average tariff is 9.7 percent. The U.S. average tariff is 4.0 percent.11 Any trade agreement will have to bring China’s tariffs down significantly. Zero tariffs on all products imported into both countries may be too much to ask for, given the realities of interest group influence, but the goal should be to get as close to zero as possible.



Another objective will be taking on regulatory barriers faced by U.S. agricultural and industrial products in China. In this regard, Trump’s pick for ambassador to China, Iowa governor Terry Branstad, has said that access for beef and biotech products will be among his top priorities once he takes office.12 Last year, a Chinese agency lifted a ban on some U.S. beef products, but other products, such as beef from cows older than 30 months, are still subject to this ban.13 Trade negotiations will provide a platform for the two parties to address these kinds of issues, and a trade agreement will be a great vehicle to establish some concrete and enforceable commitments.



As discussed above in relation to WTO complaints against China, services trade is also important. As noted, the U.S. complaint about access to the credit card service market in China is still outstanding. Other services for which there are restrictions include films and audio‐​visual services, banking, telecommunications, insurance, and express delivery. New commitments could help open these service sectors.



As for SOEs, the TPP rules in this area provide a good framework. A U.S.-China negotiation will have to start fresh, but the core TPP principles of nondiscrimination, no market‐​distorting subsidies, and acting in accordance with commercial considerations are sound. The inclusion of these principles could help address Chinese oversupply in the steel and aluminum industries, as this is mainly caused by government subsidies and other forms of state intervention. If these SOEs begin to operate on a commercial basis, the current market saturation will be reduced as supply and demand come into balance.



And on intellectual property, there is a long‐​standing complaint that China does not do enough to crack down on counterfeit goods. A WTO complaint was supposed to help address this issue, but U.S. industries remain concerned. Beyond the WTO, the United States and China have been using the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue platform to address these issues. Through this mechanism, China has promised to develop new legislation and improve the enforcement of existing laws.14 These commitments could be incorporated into a trade agreement.



Along the same lines, with regard to accusations of cyber hacking being used to steal secrets from U.S. businesses, in 2015 President Obama and President Xi signed a cyber agreement in which both sides agreed not to support or conduct any cyber theft of intellectual property, trade secrets, or other commercial information. After the agreement, it has been reported that there have been positive changes regarding cyber espionage activities. The cyber agreement or an updated version could be included in a trade agreement.



Another emerging issue relates to China’s new laws governing information and communication technology (ICT). Recent legislation, including the National Security Law (2015), Counterterrorism Law (2015), and Cybersecurity Law (2016), all raise concerns over unnecessary restrictions on, or discriminatory measures against, foreign ICT products on the grounds of cyber security. In the draft of the Counterterrorism Law, for example, there was a requirement for ICT providers to turn over encryption codes to the government. The requirement was later dropped in the final text, but there are concerns over whether the same requirement is effectively embedded in the term “secure and controllable,” which appears in drafts for banking and insurance regulatory guidelines. To address these issues, a provision on encryption similar to one in the TPP could be included in the agreement with China.



Finally, on the long‐​standing accusations of currency manipulation by China, there have been recent suggestions that the United States may revise its countervailing duty law to allow the imposition of duties in response to currency manipulation.15 This approach to the issue may make negotiating a U.S.-China trade agreement easier. Economists have pointed out that China is now trying to prevent the value of its currency from falling, rather than keeping it undervalued, so perhaps duties would not even be imposed on China under the new law.



 **Understanding China**  
If the United States wants to improve its economic relationship with China and reach agreement on some of the trade and investment issues mentioned above, it is essential for U.S. negotiators to understand how China sees itself and its relationship with the United States. In this regard, China has particular cultural and political characteristics that need to be taken into account.



Traditionally, “saving face” is a defining quality of Chinese culture. In this context, “face” implies the receipt of an appropriate level of respect that correlates with a person’s social status. As a rising power (and the world’s second largest country in terms of GDP), China expects respect and reciprocity from the United States. These expectations are reflected in the new phrase that Chinese leaders have used to describe U.S.-China relations — “a new model of major power relations” (新型大国关系).



China has described these relations as “no conflict, no confrontation, mutual respect, and win‐​win cooperation.”16 In essence, China will respect the United States and its interests, but it expects the same level of respect in return. Also implicit is that the United States will accept China’s status as a major power. That means China will not subordinate itself to the United States and will not follow U.S. demands when they are not in China’s interest. A hostile and aggressive approach by the United States may be considered a breach of such a relationship. If it feels disrespected or embarrassed, China may have less incentive to work with the United States. By contrast, if the United States takes a positive and constructive approach, the Chinese will be more likely to engage in negotiation and concede on certain issues.



To illustrate this point, if this is to be a negotiation, China will have demands, too. One of these is likely to be that the United States begins treating China as a market economy in its antidumping calculations. This will be difficult for the United States to accept. However, if the United States can get enough concessions in other areas (such as SOEs and overcapacity in steel production) and can impose some additional disciplines on China’s own abuses of antidumping measures, perhaps it could go along with this demand.



Similarly, there has been talk of revising the review of foreign investment carried out by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) so as to broaden its scope. Chinese companies have previously challenged CFIUS decisions blocking their investment,17 and expanding the scope of this review is likely to be of concern. As part of a negotiation on trade and investment, the United States could commit to maintaining the existing focus for reviewing Chinese investments and keeping the review process from being abused.



Domestic Chinese politics are another important consideration, and are a reason that a negotiation may hold more promise than some might think. Working with the United States is in China’s best interest from a domestic perspective. President Xi is facing a reelection and needs to demonstrate to the party that he is in command and can establish good relations with other major powers. Also, China needs stability and a plan for long‐​term economic growth, which a trade agreement with the United States can help provide. In addition, with the continued modernization of China’s economy, there are more common interests between the United States and China. For instance, China hopes to climb the manufacturing value chain, which requires it to continue engaging with the global market and strengthening its IP protection. As a result, China has an incentive to work with the United States on many of the issues noted above.



Amidst the populist movements in the United Kingdom and the United States, countries are turning toward China to exhibit leadership on globalization. China’s President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang have advocated publicly for open markets and have committed to continue liberalizing China’s market for trade and investment. Some may not have much confidence in such statements, as China has not really lived up to the promises it has made in the past (such as those related to IP enforcement and preferential policies toward local innovation and technology). In some instances, China took steps to reform its economic and market structure, but the market reaction caused the government to pull back. As a result, some pro‐​liberalization Chinese leaders may welcome an international negotiation, so as to use external forces to support and accelerate domestic reforms. Finally, China may be more serious about reform than people give it credit for. The influence of marketoriented thinking within the government may indicate that Chinese economic policy will be more liberal than in the past. President Xi’s top economic adviser, He Liu, a U.S.- educated advocate for economic liberalization, has long pushed for disciplining SOEs and reducing trade barriers.18



Liu seems to have a significant influence on the economic reforms within the government and was behind multiple five‐​year plans and national industry policies in recent years. He is also the originator of new reform ideas such as supply‐​side structural reform (供给侧结构性改革, which includes tax reduction and loosening government intervention) and top‐​down design for economic reform (顶层设计, which means providing a general plan in which details can be integrated later). Many of these ideas have been emphasized in government documents and President Xi’s speeches. More importantly, he has a close relationship with President Xi, who has openly expressed that Liu is an important adviser.19 It has been speculated that Liu will be the next premier.



Of course, this does not mean that negotiations with China will be easy. But there are enough positive signs that it is worth attempting engagement on issues of concern to the United States.



 **Looking Ahead**  
During the presidential campaign and the early stages of the Trump administration, we have seen a great deal of criticism of China’s trade practices. Some of the administration’s key officials are known for their strident criticism of China and may not be willing to engage at all. Famously, Peter Navarro, the head of the White House Trade Council, is the producer of a documentary called “Death by China.” If these views prevail, a negotiation on trade and investment with China may have to wait for a new administration. Nonetheless, despite the concerns about an aggressive U.S. trade policy toward China under President Trump, there are some positive signs as well. Trump’s appointment of Iowa governor Terry Branstad as the ambassador to China offers some hope, as Branstad has a long‐​term relationship with China and President Xi. The history between the two can be traced back 30 years, when Branstad was the Iowa governor and Xi was a local government official who came to Iowa to learn about farming technology. Branstad, still waiting on confirmation, has expressed his intention to keep a “win‐​win” relationship with China and sees potential for increased Chinese investment in the United States. And recently, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin expressed the hope for a “healthy” relationship with China.20 If this is how the White House intends to approach relations with China, there is a great opportunity to negotiate a new U.S.-China economic relationship.



While there has been trade tension between the United States and China in recent years, and to some extent it will surely continue, their interests are often complementary rather than conflicting, and it is in the interest of both countries to maintain a close economic relationship. Trade threats and trade wars will only do both sides harm. It would be great if the Trump administration would realize this and put the U.S.-China relationship on a positive path. If they do not, and the current model of tension, litigation, and threats continues, the task of negotiating with China will simply be passed on to some future administration.

"**More than half of Scottish engineering firms have reported positive Covid-19 tests among their workforces in the final quarter of the year.**
A survey of about 140 companies by industry body Scottish Engineering found 56% ""experienced and managed the impact"" of a positive test.
More than 40% said productivity was affected by ""Covid isolation absence"".
Despite this, there was ""significant"" improvement in orders, output and exports on the previous quarter.
That said, most indicators remained in negative territory.
Confidence overall among companies improved significantly from a net balance of -40% to -9%.
There was also an improvement in staffing, with the percentage of companies planning further redundancies falling from 60% in the previous quarter to 21%.
Scottish Engineering said the latest review provided ""some optimism"" for 2021, with measures to manage Covid - including a rolling vaccination programme - expected to arrive as early as the spring.
However, it added there was still concern that the hardest hit sectors, such as aerospace and oil and gas, would see slower recovery in the face of weaker demand.
Uncertainty around Brexit was also cited as a concern.
Scottish Engineering chief executive Paul Sheerin said the survey highlighted ""positive aspects"" but caution remained, particularly ""for those areas where recovery looks further away"".
He added: ""The winter economic support package from the UK government is genuinely welcomed, but come spring we need to ask whether we want to retain the strength we have in these sectors, and act to provide sector specific support to enable their survival.
""Other countries are doing so already, so if we want to retain our current capability, a preservation plan is needed, clear and visible long before the current support ends."""
"Scotland is renowned for its seabirds, thanks to landmarks such as the Bass Rock, Ailsa Craig and St Kilda. There are around five million of the birds, including 95% of the EU’s great skuas, 67% of its northern gannets and 65% of its black-legged kittiwakes.  But numbers are declining fast, with shortages of prey and habitat problems conspiring to affect the birds’ breeding success. According to a new RSPB report commissioned by the Scottish government, the declines date back as far as 1986. They have been greatest for Arctic skua (an 80% drop), Arctic tern (72%) and black-legged kittiwake (68%). Under the European birds directive, member states have a duty to protect habitats for the conservation of birds, including developing special protected areas. Although these areas already exist for seabird colonies on land, the RSPB urgently wants seven designated areas for birds at sea. In time it also wants the Scottish government to designate a separate set of marine protected areas to protect seabird foraging grounds.  While protected areas on land are beneficial, they only protect a limited proportion of the seabird’s life cycle. A recent ecological modelling study found that seabirds’ success at breeding is affected by the availability and quality of their prey.  Having protected areas at sea that include foraging areas may therefore protect seabird populations and boost their resilience. The sites proposed for the new special protected areas include the inner and outer sandbanks of the Firth of Forth; an area of the Pentland Firth; and the seas around Foula, Shetland.  The fall in bird populations is possibly being exacerbated by human activities at sea. People have long affected seabird populations in this way, but the variety of pressures has increased in recent years. The recent proposals for marine renewable energy developments, particularly wind but also wave and tidal, are often seen as yet another potential threat to seabirds that may be hard to justify when numbers are already falling.  Admittedly it is hard to separate the effect of marine renewable energy from other effects, particularly climate change. Much effort is being put into designing research and monitoring studies that can give us a clearer picture here. A group of scientists, civil servants and NGOs from around the globe recently met in Stornoway to discuss these issues.  Whatever the case, climate change certainly seems to be causing problems. Increased storminess is affecting bird populations, for example. In recent years we have seen huge wrecks of seabirds, with record numbers washed up dead or injured on beaches.   Scientists have also drawn a link between climate change, rising sea temperatures and shifting fish distributions, both for seabird prey species such as sandeels and larger species. A recent study documented bluefin tuna in high latitute sub-polar waters far beyond their usual habitat. It is not known how well seabirds will cope with these changes, especially during the breeding season when they are tied to a nest.  At the same time, the birds are also competing with commercial fisheries over these increasingly limited fish stocks. One problem to have made news recently is fishing boats discarding their catches. Whatever the positives of banning the practice, it is not good news for scavenger seabirds. Another threat to the birds is our addiction to plastic. On top of well known concerns about the likes of shopping bags and food wrappers, microplastics have been shown to be present, in the form of microbeads, in shower gels, face washes, toothpaste and cleaning products. These microbeads are too small to be filtered by most water treatment plants and find their way into lakes and rivers and eventually the marine environment. We are yet to fully understand the consequences of wildlife consuming plastics, but a recent four-year study by the University of Tasmania examined their toxic effects to seabirds. It found that the amounts of plastic being ingested by the birds increased during the study, and that it undermined their body condition and apparently also the chances of their chicks reaching adulthood.  All these seaborne problems lie behind the RSPB’s call for protected areas offshore. To get the best out of the strategy, it is essential that we have a good understanding of not only which areas are important for seabirds but also why. In this regard, there is still much we don’t know. Seabird tracking projects such as the RSPB’s FAME project will be key to understanding how oceanography and habitat influence seabird distributions.  We should also be mindful that seabird foraging areas may change in future depending on how climate change affects things like fish distributions. This might mean we have to change protected areas accordingly, so any network of areas needs to be flexible to ensure it fully protects the seabirds it is set to serve. The Scottish government has a legal obligation to protect seabirds, but is it not of national interest to actually have thriving populations? A recent study on the economic impact of wildlife tourism in Scotland commissioned by the Scottish government found that the net economic impact in Scotland due to wildlife tourism was £65 million, with many of the businesses focusing on seabirds.  The economic impact was also highest in the more rural Highlands and Islands region, an area that could certainly do with the boost. Put together with the legal and conservational rationales, this is one more reason why the RSPB’s proposals ought to lead to government action. "
"**Scrapping plans for a new segregated cycle path in Southsea will increase congestion and pollution, cycling campaigners have warned.**
Portsmouth City Council said its three-week trial route between Elm Grove and Kings Road would not be continued.
It had been billed as ""creating a safe space"" for cyclists, but local traders said it had disrupted business.
The Pompey Cycle Forum criticised a trial for the scheme held in November.
The lane was installed earlier this month using part of a Â£214,515 emergency active travel fund from the government, which aimed to boost cycling and walking over lockdown.
Lost parking spaces have also been restored after almost 70% of 1,400 respondentsÂ to a council survey said the lane had a ""negative impact"", according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.
Council transport chief Lynne Stagg said the scheme was halted as it was ""not supported"".
""It is a shame that it has not worked but we are committed to continuing to work with cyclists, residents and businesses along these roads,"" she added.
Khoshnaw Agha, owner of the Mediterranean Supermarket in Elm Grove, said she was ""really struggling"" with the lane in place.
She said: ""Customers had nowhere to park - some got tickets for parking on yellow lines - and it made it difficult to get our deliveries.""
Pompey Cycle Forum criticised running the trial in late autumn during the second national lockdown.
A statement said: ""There was not enough time to measure real aims of the scheme, which was to enable some residents to feel safe in switching their mode of transport away from relying on private vehicles, and towards using more sustainable methods.
""Those who would like to use pedal power more often are frightened off the roads only to increase the congestion, pollution and poor air quality."""

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhen the Chancellor’s chief advisor goes out to the public and tells everybody that the Chancellor is failing, then it can mean only one thing: the Chancellor has stopped listening. Now the advisor (Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber) is teed off and has stooped to back-biting.

Schellnhuber says only a radical transformation can curb the climate catastrophe. Photo source: Creative Commons-Lizenz Namensnennung-Weitergabe unter gleichen Bedingungen 3.0 Unported, Foto Hollin (http://www.foto-hollin.de).
It appears the last time Hans left Merkel’s office, the door hit him in the rear. Or she’s just ignoring his climate drivel. Now he’s out in public calling her a failure. Could it be that physicist Merkel smells something fishy in Prof. Creepy-Climate Schellnhuber’s 2-degree fantasy? Hat-tip to Dr. Herrmann Ott here.
The story is reported here in Spiegel: Merkel’s advisor warns of a climate shock. I haven’t bought this week’s printed issue, but the online abstract pretty much says it all:
Just one week before the world climate summit in Qatar, the chief advisor for climate issues to the German government, Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, accuses politics for the failure.”

Spiegel continues:
The target of limiting warming to two degrees by the end of the century can only be achieved by a massive overhaul. […] ‘We’ve said on multiple occasions that we need nothing less than a new industrial revolution.’ […] Schellnhuber is demanding that Merkel to assemble a ‘coalition of the willing’. Unfortunately, the head of the government does not have climate protection as a ‘top priority’.”
Green Parliamentarian Herrmann Ott adds at his ultra-fundamentalist green site:
…in the German debate, even the climate advisor to the German government, Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber, accuses Chancellor Angela Merkel of failure in climate policy and demands climate be given ‘top priority’.”
Merkel needs to get with it, Schellnhuber’s saying. Obviously she hasn’t been listening to him much lately. Gee, I wonder why. After all, she’s only had the financial collapse of Europe to worry about. Like she couldn’t devote more time to a fantasy crisis?

"**An influx of Black Friday shoppers to Cardiff prompted a shopping centre to ask visitors to wait outside as it managed social-distancing.**
St David's Cardiff tweeted it was busy and shoppers may have to wait to be let in as staff managed capacity.
Meanwhile, Transport for Wales said it would use extra staff this weekend after a rise in anti-social behaviour.
It said passenger numbers had been increasing since the end of the firebreak lockdown on 9 November.
Last weekend almost 200 people were refused travel by its staff for not wearing a face covering, anti-social behaviour or for being unfit to travel, it said.
It said more than 2,000 people across the network had to be asked to put on a face covering - a legal requirement on all public transport in Wales.
It urged people to plan ahead, check travel advice and make use of its recently-launched capacity checker to avoid busy periods.
It comes as police have been granted extra powers, including carrying out random vehicle checks, to ensure people are not breaking Covid-19 rules in Cardiff.
The powers will be in place from 09:00 GMT on Friday until 17:00 on Sunday and people breaching regulations could be fined and told to leave the city, the force said."

Share this...FacebookTwitterI’m late this time around with meteorologist Joe Bastardi’s Saturday Summary (4/20). If you haven’t seen it, then do take the few minutes to do so. He has a short outlook for the coming years.
He starts by showing the global temperature for the last 4 years: “…you can see the fall that is occurring; it’s very plain to see“.

 Snapshot of Joe Bastardi’s Saturday Summary (4/20).
Of course four years do not make a trend. But they do come after 11 years of stagnation. After 11 years of no warming, one would think the warming would finally resume. Instead just the opposite has occurred – and it has been cooling amazingly fast (almost 0.4°C) – thus completely defying the models. Boy, the oceans must have one big appetite!
If the last four years had seen warming, all the alarmists would be jumping up and down right now, hollering that global warming has resumed and that we’re all doomed.

Bastardi:
I’ve seen some outrageous statements being made lately, just simply denying the facts that the previous 12, 13 years have been level. And now you see it falling off. This is because the Pacific Decadal Oscillation has flipped. Though there are much more important things facing our country today, and facing the globe in general, this issue has really been blown out of proportion compared to the importance of some other things. In my opinion, even though I’m involved in it, you might think: ‘You get a lot of attention, why are you trying to downplay it?’ Because it’s a joke! Alright, the global temperatures respond to the sun, the ocean, the large-scale drivers, and not to the other things.
If you just watch as an objective person, if you watch over the coming years, you’ll see this trend continue. Just like you can’t deny it was going up when the oceans were warming up in the 80s – from the very cold levels of the 60s and 70s – you can’t deny that it’s going down now.”
Are Rob Honeycutt and his buddy Dana listening?
Last I heard is that they’ve turned to blaming the oceans for eating up all the lost warming. Unfortunately for them, the bet was on RSS and UAH trends, and not the temperature down somewhere in the ocean depths.
They shouldn’t take it too hard, though, because it’s for charity. And besides, it should come to them as a relief that the world isn’t going to burn up like they thought (or hoped?) it would.

"1970 was a simpler time. (February was a simpler time too, but for a moment let’s think outside the pandemic bubble.) Simpler because our environmental troubles could be easily seen. The air above our cities was filthy, and the water in our lakes and streams was gross. There was nothing subtle about it. In New York City, the environmental lawyer Albert Butzel described a permanently yellow horizon: “I not only saw the pollution, I wiped it off my windowsills.” Or consider the testimony of a city medical examiner: “The person who spent his life in the Adirondacks has nice pink lungs. The city dweller’s are black as coal.” You’ve probably heard of Cleveland’s Cuyahoga River catching fire, but here’s how the former New York governor Nelson Rockefeller described the Hudson south of Albany: “One great septic tank that has been rendered nearly useless for water supply, for swimming, or to support the rich fish life that once abounded there.” Everything that people say about the air and water in China and India right now was said of America’s cities then. It’s no wonder that people mobilized: 20 million Americans took to the streets for the first Earth Day in 1970 – 10% of America’s population at the time, perhaps the single greatest day of political protest in the country’s history. And it worked. Worked politically because Congress quickly passed the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act and scientifically because those laws had the desired effect. In essence, they stuck enough filters on smokestacks, car exhausts and factory effluent pipes that, before long, the air and water were unmistakably cleaner. The nascent Environmental Protection Agency commissioned a series of photos that showed just how filthy things were. Even for those of us who were alive then, it’s hard to imagine that we tolerated this. But we should believe it, because now we face even greater challenges that we’re doing next to nothing about. And one reason is you can’t see them. The carbon dioxide molecule is invisible; at today’s levels you can’t see it or smell it, and it doesn’t do anything to you. Carbon with one oxygen molecule? That’s what kills you in a closed garage if you leave the car running. But two oxygen molecules? All that does is trap heat in the atmosphere. Melt ice caps. Raise seas. Change weather patterns. But slowly enough that most of the time, we don’t quite see it. And it’s a more complex moment for another reason. You can filter carbon monoxide easily. It’s a trace gas, a tiny percentage of what comes from a power plant. But carbon dioxide is the exact opposite. It’s most of what comes pouring out when you burn coal or gas or oil. There’s no catalytic converter for CO2, which means you have to take down the fossil fuel industry. That in turn means you have to take on not just the oil companies but also the banks, asset managers and insurance companies that invest in them (and may even own them, in the wake of the current economic crash). You have to take on, that is, the heart of global capital. And so we are. Stop the Money Pipeline, a coalition of environmental and climate justice groups running from the small and specialized to the Sierra Club and Greenpeace, formed last fall to try to tackle the biggest money on earth. Banks like Chase – the planet’s largest by market capitalization – which has funneled a quarter-trillion dollars to the fossil fuel industry since the Paris agreement of 2015. Insurers like Liberty Mutual, still insuring tar sands projects even as pipeline builders endanger Native communities by trying to build the Keystone XL during a pandemic. This campaign sounds quixotic, but it seemed to be getting traction until the coronavirus pandemic hit. In January, BlackRock announced that it was going to put climate at the heart of its investment analyses. Liberty Mutual, under similar pressure from activists, began to edge away from coal. And Chase – well, Earth Day would have seen activists engaging in civil disobedience in several thousand bank lobbies across America, sort of like the protest in January that helped launch the campaign (and sent me, among others, off in handcuffs). But we called that off; there’s no way we were going to risk carrying the microbe into jails, where the people already locked inside have little chance of social distancing. Still, the pandemic may be causing as much trouble for the fossil fuel industry as our campaign hoped to. With the demand for oil cratering, it’s clear that these companies have no future. The divestment campaign that, over a decade, has enlisted $14tn in endowments and portfolios in the climate fight has a new head of steam. Our job – a more complex one than faced our Earth Day predecessors 50 years ago – is to force the spring. We need to speed the transition to the solar panels and wind turbines that engineers have worked so mightily to improve and are now the cheapest way to generate power. The only thing standing in the way is the political power of the fossil fuel companies, on clear display as Donald Trump does everything in his power to preserve their dominance. That’s hard to overcome. Hard but simple. Just as in 1970, it demands unrelenting pressure from citizens. That pressure is coming. Indigenous nations, frontline communities, faith groups, climate scientists and savvy investors are joining together, and their voices are getting louder. Seven million of us were in the streets last September. That’s not 20 million, but it’s on the way. We can’t be on the streets right now. So we’ll do what we can on the boulevards of the Internet. Join us for Earth Day Live, three days of digital activism beginning 22 April. We’re in a race, and we’re gaining fast.

Wellington has already declared a climate emergency, even though it is as cold this winter as ever. Yes, we have had a few nice winter days, but the nights are as cold as ever… the wind bites as much as ever… but the Wellington City Council knows best and have decided we are in a state of emergency. I’d love to see a real emergency… well, no. Scratch that. I guess what I meant was, I would like to see these clowns deal with a real emergency, but it isn’t the councillors who do the hard work when the situation is real and dire, is it?



Councillor Nicola Young recently pointed out that since supermarkets ditched bags, the council itself was likely the [largest producer of plastic bags in the city](https://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/113563745/wellington-climate-plan-called-preachy-nonsense-and-a-farce-by-councillors).   
Southern ward election candidate Laurie Foon said to aim to be a plastic-free city was “an aspirational and bold stand”, but the council needed to be leading the way. 



“An action would be to phase out single use plastics at council venues and events. 



“For example single-use drink bottles that are for sale at council venues.”   
Another opportunity was to reduce single-use plastic at festivals.   
“I would like to see this as a main focus for all council and council supported events.” 



Plastic free means plastic free, right? Or does it just mean that the council can ditch the forms of plastic it doesn’t like, but continue to use others?



Sorry, but that is not what ‘plastic free’ means to me.



So for Wellington to be truly ‘plastic free’, it will need to dispose of its plastic rubbish collection bags. It will also need to dispose of its recycling bins because… well, they are plastic.



The council will have to dispose of all microwave ovens, fridges and most of its kitchen fittings in the Council buildings because they are plastic… and they will have to dispose of all smartphones for councillors and staff. They will also have to dispose of their computers, printers and office chairs because… plastic. What about the mayoral cars, and vehicles used by council staff? There must be a Morris 1000 out there somewhere.



Doctors will not be able to give flu shots, issue Epipens or even give out medicines in blister packs or – heaven forbid – plastic bottles. 



The hospital will have to get rid of all plastic water bottles for patients, crutches and wheelchairs that have plastic components, and of course will have to stop fitting surgical mesh. They will not be able to supply meals (because they’re packed in and served on plastic) to patients, or have fridges (because they’re built of plastic) for their medication. In the end, it will be simpler to move all surgery to another hospital because too many pieces of equipment in the operating theatres have plastic components… and we can’t have that, can we?



There will be no road cones. No Hi-vis jackets. No roadside Portaloos for construction staff. No toilet seats either… council staff will have nothing to go on.



WCC subsidises Singapore Airlines, but that will have to change. They will have to replace all the seats, trays, handles and pilot instrument panels in all aircraft, including Air New Zealand aircraft. It would obviously be better to just declare Wellington as a place that no one can fly into, or out of, as the same problem applies to the airport. What about all that luggage that is partly or totally composed of plastic? Plastic free means plastic free, right?



Are you with me yet, councillors?



About 7600 tonnes of plastic is sent to Southern Landfill in Wellington each year, and of that, 928 tonnes could have been recycled in Wellington’s kerbside collections.  
[Laurie] Foon said Wellington needed to reduce emissions, and getting organics out of the landfill would be a good start. 



Current councillor and Green candidate Iona Pannett said “it’s not easy being green” when everything around her wasn’t.   
She was surprised recently when she was given a straw at a cafe in the CBD – an item largely being abandoned by cafes across Wellington. 



She said the council could make moves to reduce plastic, but ideally everyone would go waste free and stop filling up their bins.   
“It gets you to ask some quite difficult questions about how you’re living.” 



  
So they’re not really talking about ‘plastic-free’, are they? They don’t know what they are talking about. But if they really want to be ‘plastic-free’, then the hospital, the airport, the airlines, the road crews and the council buildings need to fall into line… along with everyone else.



It will never happen. These guys are just virtue signalling… as ever.



Why do Wellingtonians keep voting in these clowns? Time to vote them out.

Good morning, Chairman Cohen, Ranking Member Franks and members of the committee. I am Daniel Ikenson, associate director of the Center for Trade Policy Studies at the Cato Institute. Today, I would like to share some general concerns about the ramifications of the auto industry bankruptcies. The views I express are my own and should not be construed as representing any official positions of the Cato Institute.



 **The Past Eight Months**



On November 5, the morning after Election Day 2008, a report was published by the Center for Automotive Research, a Detroit‐​based consulting firm, warning that three million jobs were at stake in the automotive sector unless the U.S. government acted with dispatch to ensure the continued operation of all of the Big Three automakers.1 Detroit’s media blitz was underway. And it was timed to remind the president‐​elect, as he contemplated his victory the morning after, of the contribution to his success of interests now seeking some help of their own.



The CAR report’s projection of three million job losses was predicated on some fantastical worst case scenario that if one of the Big Three were to go out of business and liquidate, numerous firms in the auto supply chain would go under as well, bringing down the remaining two auto producers, as well as all of the foreign nameplate U.S. producers and, subsequently, the rest of the parts supply chain. Oddly, the report gave no consideration to the more realistic scenario that one or two of the Detroit automakers might turn to Chapter 11 reorganization.



The subsequent public relations effort to make the case for federal assistance was pitched with an air of certitude and immediacy that the only real alternative to massive federal assistance was liquidation and contagion. The crisis‐​mongering was reminiscent of former‐​Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson’s and Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke’s insistence six weeks earlier that there was no time for Congress to think, only time for it to act on a financial sector bailout, lest the economy face financial ruin.



The mainstream media obliged the script, elevating the automobile industry “crisis” to the top of the news cycle for the next month, and helping to characterize the debate in the simplistic, polarizing dichotomy of “Main Street versus Wall Street.” The notion that some financial institutions took risks, lost big, and were rescued by Washington became the prevailing argument for bailing out the auto companies, and the specific facts about viability and worthiness were tertiary.



But public opinion that was initially accommodating of that characterization quickly changed when the CEOs of GM, Ford, and Chrysler laid waste to months of public relations planning and millions of dollars spent trying to cultivate a winning message when they each arrived in Washington, tin cups in hand, aboard their own corporate jets. That fateful incident turned the media against Detroit and reminded Americans — or at least opened their minds to the prospect — that the automakers were in dire straits because of bad decisions made in the past and helped convince them that a shake out, instead of a bailout, was the proper course of action.



Although legislation to provide funding to the automakers passed in the House of Representatives last December, the bill did not garner enough support in the Senate, where it died. Prospects for any form of taxpayer bailout seemed remote and the proper course of action for GM and Chrysler, reorganization under Chapter 11, appeared imminent. An interventionist bullet, seemingly, had been dodged. But then, just days after then‐​Secretary Paulson claimed to have no authority to divert funds from the Troubled Assets Relief Program to the auto companies, President Bush announced that he would authorize bridge loans from the TARP of $9.4 billion and $4.0 billion to GM and Chrysler, respectively.



As the companies were incurring $6 billion of operating losses per month at that time, it did not require a Ph.D. in finance to recognize that they would exhaust those funds in a matter of months and be back at the trough. And when they returned — as stipulated in the terms of the loans — to present their revitalization plans, it was evident that central to those plans were billions more dollars in taxpayer assistance. 



As President Obama was correct to conclude at that point, the companies had not produced viable business plans worthy of continued financing. At that point, the president should have pointed the way toward the bankruptcy courts and moved on. Instead, he asserted a major role (and responsibility) for the administration by choosing to facilitate the bankruptcy processes of both companies by brokering pre‐​bankruptcy deals with major stakeholders. He even “influenced” the occasional personnel move and operational decision.



Both companies entered and emerged from bankruptcy protection in short order, restructured according to the plans crafted by the Obama administration. This testimony discusses some of the potential ramifications of the unusual bankruptcy processes and outcomes.



 **Ramifications of the Auto Bankruptcies**



The emergence of General Motors from bankruptcy on July 10 marked the end of the first chapter of what is an evolving cautionary tale about the triumph of politics over markets and the rule of law. As the next chapter unfolds, some of the adverse consequences of a gratuitously political bankruptcy process for both GM and Chrysler are likely to become evident.



Bankruptcy was always the best option for GM and Chrysler. But both companies were resistant to filing for bankruptcy protection, allegedly because they were concerned that car buyers would eschew purchasing from companies in bankruptcy. Though it is difficult to make the case that car buyers would prefer to purchase from companies in limbo, bouncing from one bailout prospect to next, it is likely that resistance to standalone Chapter 11 filings had more to do with the kinds of changes an independent bankruptcy judge would have required to meet the threshold of a viable “going concern.” But after reassuring consumers that bankruptcy did not mean liquidation and that car warranties would be honored regardless, President Obama escorted both companies into the bankruptcy process.



Indeed, the process should have begun long before then. It should have happened long before President Bush felt compelled to circumvent the wishes of Congress and “lend” Chrysler and GM $13.4 billion from the TARP allotment. It should have happened long before President Obama had the chance to promise billions more and assume a large role for the U.S. government in Chrysler’s and GM’s restructuring and future operations. It should have happened long before President Obama created a huge moral hazard by strong‐​arming Chrysler’s and GM’s preferred lenders into taking pennies on their loan dollars, while giving preference to claimants of lesser priority. It should have happened long before Ford, Toyota, Honda, BMW, Kia, and the rest of America’s automobile industry were implicitly taxed by the government’s insistence on preventing two firms from exiting the market or otherwise reducing their presence by restructuring in accordance with established bankruptcy provisions. And it should have happened long before other businesses in other industries started to get the idea that failure is the new success.



President Bush’s extension of “loans” to Chrysler and GM, in circumvention of the wishes of Congress and in contravention of the express purpose of the Troubled Assets Relief Program to support “financial institutions,” was the original policy sin. Without those loans, both automakers likely would have sought protection under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code before the end of 2008. The duration of bankruptcy may have been longer than it ultimately turned out to be, but the outcomes might have been more in line with the precedents and orthodoxy of established bankruptcy law, and consistent with expectation of how market economies are supposed to function.



Instead, on account of President Obama’s doubling down by taking responsibility for crafting and ramming through the courts his prepackaged “surgical” bankruptcies, the entire auto industry faces a precarious set of circumstances. Taxpayers are now majority stakeholders in a company whose success depends on good stewardship from a 536 CEOs with disparate political interests that are not necessarily aligned with GM’s business interests. Prospects that taxpayers will be made whole for their $50 billion coerced investment are dimmer than prospects that the public outlay will grow larger. As the Obama administration seeks to justify its wisdom in intervening, it will be tempted to use public policy and the tax code to tip the scales further in favor of GM, while hamstringing the competition. 



Meanwhile, the United Autoworkers Union, typically more concerned about how corporate profits are carved up, rather than attained, is majority owner of Chrysler.



Neither GM’s nor Chrysler’s management situation is particularly confidence‐​inspiring, which bodes ill for the companies’ prospects for raising capital to make the kinds of investments policy makers are intent on thrusting upon them in the name of emissions reduction. Prospects for raising capital in the form of debt have already suffered from the Obama administration’s poor treatment of secured debt holders. Not only will that temper demand for GM’s and Chrysler’s debt, but for corporate debt across industries. With the economy still fragile and the number of bankruptcies still increasing, typically risk‐​averse preferred debt holders will be more inclined to remain on the sidelines, which will bid up the cost of debt at a time of tight credit and exploding budget deficits. It’s not a pretty picture.



As one bankruptcy expert attested before this committee, the Obama administration’s takeover of the bankruptcy process was a bit gratuitous.2 The implication that our bankruptcy laws are incapable of handling reorganization of companies this large in a timely manner is at odds with historical experience.



But perhaps even more troubling in the case of GM are the fundamental conflicts inherent in simultaneously operating and regulating the same company. How will the administration and Congress balance law, compliance, policy, and the profit objective at the same time?



 **Conflicts between Profits and Policy**



 ** _The Dealerships Issue_**



Support in Congress for legislation to compel the two automakers to restore contracts with dealerships slated for closure under their respective recovery plans affirms the views of skeptics: the pursuit of profits and political objectives often work at cross purposes. What is good for the bottom line is often incompatible with political objectives and political objectives are often incompatible with the bottom line. When decision makers are only concerned with one or the other, there is no problem. But when business operating decisions are also made or even just influenced by people who have politics to consider, something is going to give.



Notwithstanding the possibility that the choice of dealership closings was made arbitrarily, if not politically, the fact remains that the companies must cut costs to survive, and excessive dealership networks are an area that is ripe for cutting. According the GMs nominal CEO, Fritz Henderson, the planned distributor closings will save GM about $100 in distribution costs per vehicle. That translates into a few hundred million dollars of savings per year when factoring in the millions of units GM expects to produce.3 That the companies face the specter of having to abandon those efforts because a majority of its 536 CEOs have political reasons for doing so bodes ill for the companies’ prospects.



Not only does the dealership issue seriously elevate doubts that politics will not infect operational decisions at GM in particular, but it portends highly erratic management as the president and Congress wrestle for primacy in formulating policy at this majority taxpayer‐​owned entity. And since the Constitution is silent on the matter of which branch furnishes the CEO of a nationalized company, we may be in for a long period of uncertainty and instability. 



The dealership issue represents just one of many potential conflicts on the horizon. We have already witnessed other clashes between what is right from a business perspective and what is imperative politically. The president’s firing of Rick Wagoner and his subsequent endorsement of Fritz Henderson to fill GM’s CEO slot, as well as his role in influencing the selection of GM’s board members, raises questions about the administration’s motivations. Is the president interested in filling key executive positions with people who are best qualified to run a profitable enterprise or who might be more amenable to the administration’s plans for converting the economy from a carbon‐​based to a renewables‐​based one?



 ** _Profits vs. Green Production_**



The conflicts inherent between the objectives of returning GM to profitability and making it a showcase for green production should be obvious. Returning GM to profitability will require higher revenues and lower costs, neither of which is made easier by imposing more rigid CAFE standards on the automakers. To quote my Cato colleague Alan Reynolds, “General Motors can survive bankruptcy far more easily than it can survive President Barack Obama’s ambitious fuel economy standards, which mandate that all new vehicles average 35.5 miles per gallon by 2016.“4



Fuel efficiency standards are particularly punitive toward automakers that sell larger vehicles. The Big Three — GM and Ford in particular — have had their greatest success in the larger vehicle market. Their pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles, luxury cars, and muscle cars all have higher profit margins than their small vehicle offerings. But to even be eligible to sell an adequate number of these vehicles and reach overall profit targets, they must sell a sufficient number of small cars to attain a fleet efficiency of 35.5 miles per gallon. In other words, to satisfy consumer demand and realize profits on their most popular models, GM will have to sell — at low or no profit, or at a loss — a sufficient number of high mileage vehicles that are not as popular as policymakers imagine them to be.



GM in particular is at a huge disadvantage vis‐​à‐​vis the foreign nameplate producers in the United States, who already have loyal customers for their high‐​mileage vehicles. So Toyota and others will be able to compete with greater maneuverability in the market for large and luxury vehicles (where GM is most competitive), while GM is forced to divert resources to cultivate a skeptical market for its small cars.



Warren Brown, the _Washington Post’s_ auto expert, reviewed the Toyota Yaris S in his column this past Sunday. Although he is favorably disposed to the car, he writes: “[F]or all of its many virtues, the little Toyota Yaris is selling poorly in this country, where its retail numbers are down 40.4 percent in the first six months of 2009.“5 And then in a passage that speaks directly to policymakers obsessed with fuel efficiency standards, he writes: “But here is what for many of you will be a hard‐​to‐​swallow truth: Fuel‐​sippers such as the Yaris are selling in numbers well below those of the Ford F‐​series and Chevrolet Silverado picup trucks…We want cars such as the Yaris and Fit when gasoline prices are high, or when gasoline is in short supply. But when gasoline is flowing at prices that make us smile, which it usually does in the United States, we’d much rather have a Chevrolet Camarro SS with a 6.2-liter, 426‐​horsepower V-8 engine. Strange as it might seem in these hard times, Chevrolet isn’t having any trouble selling that one.“6



The lesson here is that forcing automaker to produce vehicles that Americans demand only when fuel prices are in the $4 dollar range is not going to help GM or Chrysler. The direct and honest approach to increasing demand for small vehicles — although I do not endorse it — is a national fuel surcharge that keeps the price of gasoline relatively constant at high levels. That idea is unlikely to be very popular around the country.



Between the Congressional pushback over the dealerships issue and the insistence on higher fuel efficiency standards, we see the objectives of two broad groups of policymakers: those who want green production and treat the costs of that goal as immaterial, and those who want the auto companies to remain a jobs program, regardless of the imperative of shedding workers to become more competitive. Neither camp seems to understand or care very much that fulfillment of their objectives will only hamper recovery, at best, if not drive the automakers out of existence.



 **Making the Taxpayers Whole**



Let us not lose site of the fact that $65 billion in taxpayer funds have been directed to GM and Chrysler over the past eight months — not as many zeroes on the end as seems to be required to get Washington’s attention these days, but still a lot of money. Most Americans are not too pleased about having these “investments” made on their behalf. But Washington may be forgiven if the government divests of these companies quickly, with large enough profits and returns on investment to help soothe the public’s misgivings.



In the case of GM, for taxpayers to get back their principal (without any interest or capital gain) the company will have to be worth $83 billion. That figure is derived by considering that taxpayers have “invested” roughly $50 billion in GM, which is deemed by the bankruptcy plan to be worth a 60 percent share in the company. And 60 percent of roughly $83 billion equals $50 billion. How likely is it that the value of GM will reach $83 billion anytime soon (barring dramatic inflation)?



At its historic high value in 2000, GM’s worth (based on its market capitalization) stood at $60 billion. Thus, the company’s value must increase by 38 percent from it historic high, achieved in the heady days of 2000, when Americans were purchasing 16 million vehicles per year, just to return principal to the taxpayers. But U.S. demand projections for the next few years come in at around 10 million vehicles, which suggests that prospects for the government divesting of GM profitably are extremely remote.



In fact, it is much more likely that the taxpayer investment in GM, directly or implicitly, will increase further, as the administration and some in Congress have incentive to use policy (tax policy, trade policy, and regulations) to induce consumers to purchase GM products, to subsidize production and, indeed, to hamstring GM’s competition. And this all raises the question of what will happen to Ford and the other foreign nameplate producers when the lawmakers and administrators have a favorite horse in the race. Ford is relatively healthy now, but continued support for GM and Chrysler could well drive Ford to the trough, too. At some point, Ford’s management might reckon that their closest competitors, who made terrible business decisions over the years, just got their debts erased and their downsides covered. Why not travel down that path, if things get too tough? That calculation, if it is ever made, presents the specter of another taxpayer bailout to the tunes of tens of billions of dollars, and another government‐​run auto company.



 **The U.S. Auto Industry is Healthy**



In 2008, the Big Three accounted for roughly 55% of U.S. light vehicle production and 50% of U.S. sales. To speak of the U.S. automobile industry these days, one must include Honda, Toyota, Nissan, Kia, Hyundai, BMW — and other foreign nameplate producers who manufacture vehicles in the U.S. They are the other half of the U.S. auto industry. They employ American workers, pay U.S. taxes, support other U.S. businesses, contribute to local charities, have genuine stakes in their local communities and face the same contracting demand for automobiles as do GM, Chrysler, and Ford. The important difference is that these companies have a better track record of making products Americans want to consume.



If GM or Chrysler or Ford went belly up and liquidated, people would lose their jobs. But the sky would not fall. In fact, that outcome would ultimately improve prospects for the firms and workers that remain in the industry. That is precisely what happened with the U.S. steel industry, which responded to waning fortunes and dozens of bankruptcies earlier in the decade by finally allowing unproductive, inefficient mills to shutter.



Bailouts or forced subsidizations are clearly unfair to taxpayers, but they are also unfair to the successful firms in the industry, who are implicitly taxed and burdened when their competition is subsidized. In a properly functioning market economy, the better firms — the ones that are more innovative, more efficient, and more popular among consumers — gain market share or increase profits, while the lesser firms contract. This process ensures that limited resources are used most productively and that the most successful firms lead us into the future.



Last November, one day before the CEOs of GM, Ford, and Chrysler told the Senate Banking Committee that their industry faced imminent collapse without an emergency infusion of $25 billion, a new automobile assembly plant opened for business in Greensburg, Indiana. Although the hearing on Capitol Hill received far more media coverage, the unveiling of Honda’s latest facility in the American heartland spoke volumes about the future of the U.S. car industry.



There are plenty of healthy auto producers in the United States, all of whom are facing contracting demand. The ones that are best equipped to survive the recession will emerge stronger. But we undermine the objective if Ford, Toyota, Kia, Honda, Volkswagen and all the others cannot compete on a level playing field with GM to come up with the next generation of fuel‐​efficient cars.



 **Some Final Thoughts**



The demise of these two iconic American automakers, Chrysler and GM, and the U.S. government’s assumption of responsibility for their rehabilitation occasioned a direct appeal from President Obama to American economic “patriotism” a few months ago. The president exclaimed, “If you are considering buying a car, I hope it will be an American car.” Ignoring, for the moment, the impropriety of the U.S. president attempting to influence commercial outcomes by endorsing particular products, even if one were inclined to buy an American car, the tricky question remains: What constitutes an “American” car? Economist Matthew Slaughter, in a recent Wall Street Journal opinion‐​editorial, attempted to elucidate:



What exactly makes a car “American?” Does it mean a car made by a U.S.-headquartered company? If so, then it is important to understand that any future success of the Big Three will depend a lot on their ability to make — and sell — cars outside the United States, not in it. A big reason Chrysler has fallen bankrupt is its narrow U.S. focus. It has not boosted revenues by penetrating fast‐​growing markets such as China, India and Eastern Europe. Nor has it lowered costs by restructuring to access talent and production beyond North America.7



However, the incredulous, angry reactions from American labor unions, their patrons in Congress, and rabble‐​rousing television and radio personalities to GM’s since‐​reversed announcement that its revitalization plans include shifting more production to Mexico and China suggest that the above definition of an American car is not universally embraced. For those who object to GM’s plans, it is not the company’s bottom line that matters, but rather the company’s capacity to create U.S. jobs and stimulate U.S. economic activity. That GM might need to start making profits in order to create U.S. jobs and stimulate U.S. economic activity somehow doesn’t factor into the equation for these detractors. Instead, in zero‐​sum fashion, they see investment in foreign operations as antithetical to domestic job creation and economic growth.8



Perhaps, then, they would find Slaughter’s alternative definition of an American car more accurate:



Or is an “American” car one made within U.S. borders? If so, then it is important to understand that America today has a robust automobile industry thanks to insourcing. In 2006, foreign‐​headquartered multinationals engaged in making and wholesaling motor vehicles and parts employed 402,800 Americans — at an average annual compensation of $63,538 — 20% above the national average. Amid the Big Three struggles of the past generation, insourcing companies like Toyota, Honda and Mercedes have greatly expanded automobile operations in the U.S. In fiscal year 2008, Toyota assembled 1.66 million motor vehicles in North America with production in seven U.S. states supported by research and development in three more.9



But many Americans have rejected this definition of an American car as well. Ironically, the people who are most inclined to oppose outsourcing and define it as “shipping jobs overseas” tend to be the same people who criticize insourcing for shipping control of U.S. assets overseas. Even though the top 10 selling models of cars and trucks in the United States in 2008 were all produced in the United States, by American and foreign nameplate producers, and even though foreign nameplate producers employ hundreds of thousands of American workers, pay local and national taxes, support local economies, reinvest part of their earnings in their U.S. operations, and invest in other local businesses, the fact that corporate headquarters are located in Tokyo or Stuttgart or Seoul seems to hold sway.



At best, there is grudging acceptance of the possibility that these “insourcing” companies are part of the American manufacturing landscape, but it is impossible to imagine that the U.S. government would have ever rescued Toyota or Honda, if they had presented with financial prospects as dire as Chrysler’s and GM’s. Yet, as put in another recent Wall Street Journal article:



Once you put down the flags and shut off all the television ads with their Heartland, apple‐​pie America imagery, the truth of the car business is that it transcends national boundaries. A car or truck sold by a “Detroit” auto maker such as GM, Ford or Chrysler could be less American — as defined by the government’s standards for “domestic content” — than a car sold by Toyota, Honda or Nissan — all of which have substantial assembly and components operations in the U.S.10



The automobile industry is one of many that “transcends national boundaries” and is only one example of why international competition can no longer be described as a contest between “our” producers and “their” producers. But the same holds for industries throughout the manufacturing sector. The fact is that the distinction between what is and what isn’t American has been blurred by foreign direct investment, cross‐​ownership, equity tie‐​ins, and transnational supply chains.



It’s time for U.S. economic policy to catch up to that commercial reality.

8 For the record, the empirical evidence supports a positive relationship between the growth of a company’s foreign operations and the growth of its domestic operations. Following is an excerpt from Daniel T. Griswold, “ ‘Shipping Jobs Overseas’ or Reaching New Customers? Why Congress Should not Tax Reinvested Earnings Abroad,” Cato Institute Free Trade Bulletin No. 36, January 13, 2009: “Investing abroad is not about ‘shipping jobs overseas.’ There is no evidence that expanding employment at U.S.- owned affiliates comes at the expense of overall employment by parent companies back home in the United States. In fact, the evidence and experience of U.S. multinational companies points in the opposite direction: foreign and domestic operations tend to compliment each other and expand together. A successful company operating in a favorable business climate will tend to expand employment at both its domestic and overseas operations. More activity and sales abroad often require the hiring of more managers, accountants, lawyers, engineers, and production workers at the parent company.”

"**The UK would be making a ""terrible mistake"" to relax Covid measures just months before vaccines are expected to take effect, a leading scientist said.**
Prof Peter Openshaw, a government adviser, said the nation should not ""take the brakes off"" at this stage ""when the end is in sight"".
He said infection rates, numbers in hospital and deaths were all too high.
But he said recent trial results showed ""for sure that this is a virus we can defeat with vaccination"".
Prof Openshaw, a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage) who works at Imperial College London, told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""We scientists are very concerned indeed about relaxation of precautions at this stage.
""The rates are still too high, there's too many cases coming into hospitals, too many people dying.""
England's lockdown is ending this week, when it will enter a three-tier system of restrictions. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the tier system would be given an expiry date of 3 February.
Elsewhere in the UK, Scotland is using a five-level system of restrictions while Northern IrelandÂ has begun a two-week circuit-breaker lockdown.
In Wales, the hospitality industry is due to be placed under stricter rules - not yet finalised - from 4 December.
Prof Openshaw said: ""If we take the brakes off at this stage, just when the end is in sight, I think we would be making a huge mistake.""
He said it was ""extremely difficult"" to decide on the right measures against the virus but said he thought it was important to ""keep this under control and just behave very, very sensibly"".
""We've all sacrificed so much, everyone has sacrificed enormously in order to get the transmission rate down. With only a few months to go until vaccines start to have an effect I think it would just be a terrible mistake,"" the professor said.
He welcomed the initial data published showing several vaccines had high levels of effectiveness at preventing infections.
""Several trials are reporting very good efficacy and that I think means for sure that is a virus we can defeat with vaccination,"" he said.
Prof Openshaw said more data was needed to explain why the Oxford vaccine showed different levels of effectiveness in one part of the trial, in which volunteers were mistakenly given a half-dose followed by a full dose later.
The lower initial dose resulted in a 90% effectiveness rate among a smaller sample of volunteers aged under 55, while the intended regime of two full doses was 62% effective.
But he said: ""I would personally be happy to have any vaccine that's been through the regulatory scrutiny that these trials are currently undergoing.
""If my GP rings me and says I've got an approved vaccine, I really don't care which one it is.""
The UK government has purchased another two million doses of a vaccine from US biotech firm Moderna, bringing its total to seven million - enough for abut 3.5 million people.
That vaccine was shown to be 95% effective.
It has also pre-ordered 40 million doses of a vaccine from Pfizer and BioNTech, with 10 million expected by the end of the year.
Initial data suggests it is 95% effective, with Pfizer saying it found similar results in the vulnerable over-65 population.
AstraZeneca, which is producing the Oxford vaccine, is said to have four million doses ready for the UK by the end of the year, with 40 million expected by March. The government has 100 million doses of the Oxford vaccine ordered in total.
Prof Openshaw said he would be ""surprised"" if reports that the Pfizer vaccine could be approved and in use next week turned out to be true, but he said there could be an announcement in the next fortnight.
The process ""mustn't be rushed"", he said."

Two years ago, it was “Study says global warming shrinks birds” now thanks to impressive further study, they’ve discovered it’s “Bigger birds in central California, courtesy of global climate change.“
Can’t they get their story straight? Why don’t they ask Jim Henson Hansen?
From San Francisco State University
Bigger birds in central California, courtesy of global climate change
SAN FRANCISCO — Birds are getting bigger in central California, and that was a big surprise for Rae Goodman and her colleagues.
Goodman uncovered the trend while working as a graduate student for San Francisco State University biologist Gretchen LeBuhn, analyzing data from thousands of birds caught and released each year at two sites near San Francisco Bay and the Point Reyes National Seashore. 
The SF State scientists, working with researchers from PRBO Conservation Science and the San Francisco Bay Bird Observatory who collected the data, found that birds’ wings have grown longer and birds are increasing in mass over the last 27 to 40 years.
What’s making the birds bigger? The researchers think that the trend is due to climate change, but their findings put a twist in the usual thinking about climate change and body size. A well-known ecological rule, called Bergmann’s Rule, states that animals tend to be larger at higher latitudes. One reason for this rule might be that larger animals conserve body heat better, allowing them to thrive in the generally colder climate of higher latitudes.
Under this reasoning, some scientists have predicted that animals would get smaller as the Earth has warmed up over the past 100 years. But the study, published in the journal Global Change Biology, suggests that the connection may not be so simple.
Climate change may affect body size in a variety of ways, they note in their paper. For instance, birds might get bigger as they store more fat to ride out severe weather events, which are expected to be more common under global climate change. Climate change could also alter a region’s plant growth, which may eventually lead to changes in a bird’s diet that affect its size.
LeBuhn, an assistant professor of biology, said she was “completely surprised” to find that the central California birds were growing larger over time. “It’s one of those moments where you ask, ‘what’s happening here?'” The results were so unexpected, she said, that the findings made them take a step back and look more closely at how climate change could influence body size.
The bird data come from two long-term “banding stations” in central California, where a wide variety of birds are captured, banded about the leg with an identification tag, and weighed and measured before being released. Many of the same birds were captured each year, allowing the researchers at the sites to build up a unique database that could be used to track changes among the birds over several decades.
The researchers used data from 14,735 individual birds collected from 1971 to 2010 at the Palomarin Field Station, near the southern end of the Point Reyes National Seashore, by researchers from PRBO Conservation Science. Their study also included data on 18,052 birds collected between 1983 and 2009, from the Coyote Creek Field Station at the southern end of the San Francisco Bay by the San Francisco Bay Bird Observatory.
“At the time I started my research, a few studies had looked at body size changes in a few species in Europe and the Middle East, but no one had examined bird body size changes in North America,” said Goodman, who now teaches Biology and Environmental Science at San Francisco’s Jewish Community High School of the Bay.
“We had the good fortune to find an unexpected result — a gem in research science,” she added. “But we were then left with the puzzle of figuring out what was going on.”
After testing and discarding a number of other explanations, Goodman and her colleagues were confident that climate change was behind the longer wings and bigger bodies in most of the birds. The birds may be responding to climate-related changes in plant growth or increased climate variability in central California, the researchers suggest in the paper.
“The fingerprint of climate change is showing up in many of our ecosystems,” explains Nat Seavy, research director for the Central Coast at PRBO Conservation Science. “The challenge is to use the long-term data we’ve been collecting to understand how, where and why these changes are occurring.”
The findings offer a glimpse at the potent effects of climate change across a wide range of species, LeBuhn said. “Even over a pretty short period of time, we’ve documented changes in important traits like body size, where we don’t expect to see much flexibility.”
“But in some ways,” she added, “it gave me a little more hope that these birds are able to respond — hopefully in time — to changes in climate.”
“Although it is encouraging that species are changing in response to climate change,” said Seavy, “it is also troubling that environmental stressors are pushing and pulling on species in diverse ways…What will happen to our ecosystems as some species get larger and others get smaller? We need long-term monitoring to help us understand the impact of these changes.”

Quote of the Week:
It is scientists, not sceptics, who are most willing to consider explanations that conflict with their own. And far from quashing dissent, it is the scientists, not the sceptics, who do most to acknowledge gaps in their studies and point out the limitations of their data…’ Editorial, Nature Magazine, Jul 28, 2011.

Number of the Week: 54.5

THIS WEEK:
By Ken Haapala, Executive Vice President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP)
Videos from the Sixth International Conference on Climate Change (ICCC) sponsored by Heartland Institute are available on the web. Go to:
http://climateconference.heartland.org/watch-…
******************
Quote of the Week: The quote of the week appeared in an editorial in Nature severely criticizing those who challenge the orthodoxy and the recently held International Conference on Climate Change (ICCC). The quote is particularly rich because Nature published the famous hockey-stick by Michael Mann which included “Mann’s Nature trick” – eliminating data that contradicted the central claim. The more recent tree ring data diverged significantly from thermometer data, thus calling into question the validity of using tree rings to estimate historic temperatures. These offending data were clipped. The article must be retracted. Please see Article # 1 and articles referenced under “ICCC.”

*******************
ICCC: The attack by Nature on those who challenge the orthodoxy and the ICCC sponsored by Heartland Institute was soundly rebutted by Heartland President Joe Bast. Please see articles referenced under “ICCC.”
*******************
Number of the Week: 54.5 mpg. With great fanfare, the number of the week was announced by the US President, taking time from the critical deficit ceiling issue. By 2025, 54.5 miles per gallon shall be the average mileage of automobiles sold in the US by a manufacturer. The number was agreed to by the White House, EPA, Department of Transportation, California Air Resources Board, several major automobile manufacturers, environmentalists, etc. All the major players were represented except one – the American public – the consumer who is expected to buy the automobiles manufactured under this standard.
A quick look at the costs of automobiles on web sites, such as one by US News, gives examples of the impracticality of thinking displayed by this announcement. The vaunted Toyota Prius has an invoice price of $22,108 plus but gets only 51 mpg city and 48 mpg highway – it does not qualify under the proposed standards. Comparing apples to apples, the low cost 2012 Honda Civic has an invoice of $14,388 plus and gets 28 city and 36 highway. The hybrid version gets 44 city and 44 highway but costs 53% more with an invoice starting at $22,134. A low cost SUV, Ford Escape, gets 23 city and 28 highway with an invoice of $20,120; the hybrid version has an invoice of $29,997, or 49% more, and gets 30 city and 27 highway. Frequently, hybrids get greater mileage in the city than on the highway. The regulations are orientated for the urban public and severely punish the suburban and rural public.
What is clear is that the administration is demanding the American public bends to its will and buys electric automobiles that have yet to prove their worth at significantly higher prices than gasoline automobiles. Electric vehicles have a limited range, and those employing gasoline engines do not get the mileage that is proposed. By claiming these standards will save households money, the administration continues the mantra that by forcing the public to spend much more money for energy and transportation, the public will save money.
The President has promised that the Federal government will buy many of these new, expensive automobiles, as if Washington does not recognize there are unemployment and revenue problems. Please see articles referenced under “Subsidies and Mandates Forever.”
*******************
EPA continues its highly questionable expansion of regulatory powers based on dubious claims of public health. Even the National Academy of Sciences has warned the EPA science committee that EPA must improve on its science or face scientific irrelevance. However, it is uncertain that scientific relevance is important to the leadership of the EPA.
Reports this week indicate that, for political purposes, EPA adjusted its rules on cross state emissions it announced last week. At the last minute, many east coast states that supported the president in the last election were excluded from the rules. Texas, which certainly does not support the administration, was suddenly included. Apparently, EPA considers premature deaths, heart attacks, and asthma, which it used to justify the regulations, are a function of state political boundaries.
EPA announced that it is considering employing the Clean Air Act to regulate drilling wells for oil and natural gas extraction using hydraulic fracturing “fracking.” Drilling wells for oil started in 1859. Hydraulic fracking techniques have existed for over 60 years. Recent advances in these techniques permit a rapid development of oil and gas reserves that were previously uneconomical to extract. No doubt, affordable energy alarms this administration and EPA, so EPA must regulate it under the guise of public health, no matter how scientifically irrelevant the guise is. Please see Article # 2 and articles referenced under “EPA and other Regulators on the March.”
*******************
Australia: Although it is winter down-under, things are heating up. The government just released 340 pages of legislation to enact its proclaimed simple tax on carbon – a stunning contradiction of terms in language, logic, and science. The general population is not taking these new taxes lightly. Based on reports, a peaceful rebellion is occurring. From all parts of the island continent eleven convoys are organizing to drive to the capitol city and demand a new election. The convoys are scheduled to arrive on August 22. Please see articles under “Cap-and-Trade and Carbon Taxes.”
*******************
Models and Observations: This week, an UAH press release announced the publication of a new study by Roy Spencer and Danny Braswell estimating the extent of energy lost to space with a warming of the earth.
The new study employs an innovative lagged model, that is, one that incorporates time delays, thereby estimating energy loss over time during periods of warming. The model is adjusted in order to explain the temperature data from the Hadley Climate Research Unit in Great Britain and observations from the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) instruments on the Terra satellite over the period 2000 to 2011. During this period there was no major warming trend but there were periods of warming and cooling.
Spencer’s model suggests that, in any warming period, the loss of energy to outer space starts earlier than the IPCC models consider. Consequently, the total loss of energy to outer space is significantly greater than that projected by the IPCC models. This finding is consistent with the observations. The new model, far simpler than the ones used by the IPCC, better explains the warming or lack thereof during the period of 2000 to 2011, than the IPCC models.
The model explanations are not definitive and are open to interpretation and testing. But they suggest there are far more powerful natural influences on temperature than human CO2 emissions and other variables considered by the IPCC and its models.
Of course, the global warming community re-acted as may be expected. Kevin Trenberth, a lead author of the Summary for Policymakers (SPM) of the Fourth IPCC Assessment Report (AR4), declared “I cannot believe it got published!” Spencer’s retort on his blog is worth noting. Please see the press release, Article # 4, and the referenced articles under “Models v. Observations.”

Additional Information On The “Ocean’s Missing Heat” By Katsman and van Oldenborgh 2011
By Roger Pielke, Sr, Pielke Climate Science, Jul 29 2011
http://pielkeclimatesci.wordpress.com/…
If the “question cannot be answered using observations alone”, how can it be stated that “When compared to the available observations, the model describes the ocean temperature rise and variability well”? This is a circular argument. Models themselves are hypotheses, and the more accurate statement by the authors would be that the available observations do not falsify the model as replicating reality.

 _Compliments of rising atmospheric CO 2, in the future you can have a larger cup of coffee and drink it too!_   
  
In the global market, coffee is one of the most heavily traded commodities, where more than 80 million people are involved in its cultivation, processing, transportation and marketing (Santos _et al_., 2015). Cultivated in over 70 countries, retail sales are estimated at $90 billion USD. Given such agricultural prominence, it is therefore somewhat surprising, in the words of Ghini _et al_. (2015) that “there is virtually no information about the effects of rising atmospheric CO2 on field-grown coffee trees.” Rather, there exists only a few modeling studies that estimate a future in which coffee plants suffer (1) severe yield losses (Gay _et al_., 2006), (2) a reduction in suitable growing area (Zullo _et al_., 2011), (3) extinction of certain wild populations (Davis _et al_., 2012) and (4) increased damage from herbivore, pathogen and pest attacks (Ghini _et al_., 2011; 2012; Jaramillo _et al_., 2011; Kutywayo _et al_., 2013), all in consequence of predicted changes in climate due to rising atmospheric CO2.   
  
In an effort to assess such speculative model-based predictions, the ten-member scientific team of Ghini _et al_. set out to conduct an experiment to observationally determine the response of two coffee cultivars to elevated levels of atmospheric CO2 in the first Free-air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) facility in Latin America. Small specimens (3-4 pairs of leaves) of two coffee cultivars, Catuaí and Obatã, were sown in the field under ambient (~390 ppm) and enriched (~550 ppm) CO2 conditions in August of 2011 and allowed to grow under normal cultural growing conditions without supplemental irrigation for a period of 2 years.   
  
No significant effect of CO2 was observed on the growth parameters during the first year. However, during the growing season of year 2, net photosynthesis increased by 40% (see Figure 1a) and plant water use efficiency by approximately 60% (Figure 1b), regardless of cultivar. During the winter, when growth was limited, daily mean net photosynthesis “averaged 56% higher in the plants treated with CO2 than in their untreated counterparts” (Figure 1c). Water use efficiency in winter was also significantly higher (62% for Catuaí and 85% for Obatã, see Figure 1d). Such beneficial impacts resulted in significant CO2-induced increases in plant height (7.4% for Catuaí and 9.7% for Obatã), stem diameter (9.5% for Catuaí and 13.4% for Obatã) and harvestable yield (14.6% for Catuaí and 12.0% for Obatã) over the course of year 2. Furthermore, Ghini _et al_. report that the increased crop yield “was associated with an increased number of fruits per branch, with no differences in fruit weight.”



![Figure 1. Effect of ambient \(390 ppm\) and elevated \(550 ppm\) CO2 concentration on two coffee cultivars, Catuaí \(CAT\) and Obatã \(OBA\), growing in a FACE construct: \(Panel A, top left\) net CO2 assimilation rate \(A\) during the growing season, \(Panel B, bottom left\) net CO2 assimilation rate during the winter, \(Panel C, top right\) water use efficiency \(WUE\), defined as internal-to-ambient CO2 concentration ratio \(Ci/Ca, during the growing season, \(Panel D, bottom right\) water use efficiency during the winter.

Adapted from Ghini et al. (2015)._   
  
Some have hypothesized that increasing plant matter associated with elevated CO2 would contain less protein, but with respect to leaf nitrogen content (a marker for protein content), the authors report it was “within an expected range for coffee” for both cultivars at both CO2 concentrations, “implying that no apparent N deficiency was observed in this study.” Ghini _et al_. were also able to examine the combined impact of elevated CO2 and plant damage from pests and disease. Here, they found that “under elevated CO2 reduced incidence of leaf miners ( _Leucoptera coffeela_ ) occurred on both cultivars during periods of high infestation.” In addition, they report there was no significant effect of CO2 treatment on disease incidence of rust ( _Hemileia vastatrix_ ) and Cercospora leaf spot ( _Cercospora coffeicola_ ); and fungal communities associated with mycotoxins was not affected either.   
  
All in all, it is quite clear that this _observational_ assessment of the impacts of rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations on coffee plants is quite different from that derived from _model-based_ analyses. And because observations _always_ trump projections, those who cultivate, process, transport, market, and drink coffee now have a much more optimistic future to look forward to, a world in which coffee plants will benefit from this ever-benevolent aerial fertilizer!

"By end of the century, rising seas will flood more than 500 coastal cities, affecting 1.5 billion people worldwide. Some estimates predict surging sea level rise of two meters by 2100.  Countries like Kiribati, a nation of low lying coral atolls in the Pacific, will likely disappear entirely. This is why Kiribati is among the countries to have explored the possibility of artificial islands replacing natural ones.  It may sound counter-intuitive, but floating architecture provides two big advantages. First, it creates “land” that moves with the waves and thus is resilient in the face of flooding. Second, it allows cities to expand their pressurised coastal urban spaces. Floating islands have been popularised by The Seasteading Institute, which advocates for “seasteads” – politically autonomous human settlements in international waters. The institute was founded by the libertarian Patri Friedman and controversial Facebook investor Peter Thiel. Consequently, some scholars have criticised floating islands as the playthings of Silicon Valley billionaires trying to escape taxes. But perhaps there is another side to offshore housing. As I have looked at in my PhD, floating architecture can also be a green and sustainable technology to help adapt to climate change.  No wonder the Global Center on Adaptation, a new international organisation focused on adaptation to climate change, has plans for a floating office space in Rotterdam. Another example is the Floating Island Project in French Polynesia, the focus of my research over the past three years. It was intended to be a village with special regulations floating in a lagoon, however the project lost government support after protests during the Polynesian presidential elections of 2018.   There are good reasons to be cautious about the idea that floating architecture can help communities adapt to sea level rise. The first high-tech iterations may indeed be too costly and complicated for many areas affected by sea level rise, but the growth in solar and floating home technologies point to prices reducing with time.  One of the key advantages of floating architecture is its sustainability compared to land reclamation, which can displace natural sediments and harm the marine ecosystem, since it usually means dumping sand on the seabed, annihilating corals and plankton at the bottom of the food chain.  In contrast, floating buildings can create artificial reefs, providing food and shelter for marine life. Reclaimed lands are also more vulnerable to earthquakes – a prime example is Mexico City, which was built over a lake. People have been living on human-made islands for hundreds of years. Examples include Nueva Veneciain Colombia⁠, the Uros in Lake Titikaka, Peru, or the nomads of Bajau Lautin Malaysia. Future floating cities are particularly intriguing because they represent an infrastructural blank slate. In theory, they do not need to connect to land infrastructure and can operate self-sufficiently, in a closed loop with their own solar panels and desalination plants. Floating buildings will be of two types: some are semi-submersible, and have foundations on the sea bed, like oil rigs. Others are pontoons, such as the floating homes in Ijburg, Amsterdam, Amsterdam which fully float on the water surface and are kept stable by mooring systems.  Very large floating structures can typically withstand rough seas better than boats, making them more comfortable for longer periods. The preferred material for building the floating platforms is concrete. Shaped in the right way, its can keep afloat. For buildings, materials are up to individual taste and affordability. The sheer amount of existing floating infrastructure points to the eventual emergence of floating cities. We already have floating: solar farms, wind farms, runways, bridges, container docks, nuclear plants, farms, stages, restaurants, hotels, storage facilities, student houses and homes. There is even a floating prison and floating surf pools. So I have no doubt that floating cities are possible and will become a reality at some point this century. The biggest challenges will be legal and political – not technological. In my research I have explored property ownership in floating cities. Legal frameworks are crucial because floating cities mean private buildings over oceans, which are transboundary commons. Will homeowners own the plot of water too? Will they instead own their homes, but claim temporary ownership of the space, as in trailer parks? And, if buildings are public, should we grant oceans legal personhood to ensure higher environmental protection?  There is no final answer to these questions, as each city will be unique and complex in its own way, and offshore living is only just starting.  This article was updated on June 12 as it previously stated the Global Center on Adaptation was a UN body. It is in fact an independent organisation."
"Baboons are large, smart, ground-dwelling monkeys. They are found across sub-Saharan Africa in various habitats and eat a flexible diet including meat, eggs, and plants. And they are known opportunists – in addition to raiding crops and garbage, some even mug tourists for their possessions, especially food. We might be tempted to assume that this ecological flexibility (we might even call it resilience) will help baboons survive on our changing planet. Indeed, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which assesses extinction risk, labels five of six baboon species as “of Least Concern”. This suggests that expert assessors agree: the baboons, at least relatively speaking, are at low risk. Unfortunately, my recent research suggests this isn’t the whole story. Even this supposedly resilient species m⁠a⁠y⁠ ⁠b⁠e⁠ ⁠a⁠t⁠ ⁠s⁠i⁠g⁠n⁠i⁠f⁠i⁠c⁠a⁠n⁠t⁠ ⁠r⁠i⁠s⁠k⁠ ⁠o⁠f⁠ ⁠e⁠x⁠t⁠i⁠n⁠c⁠t⁠i⁠o⁠n⁠ ⁠b⁠y⁠ ⁠2⁠0⁠7⁠0⁠.⁠ We know people are having huge impacts on the natural world. Scientists have gone as far as naming a new epoch, the Anthropocene, after our ability to transform the planet. Humans drive other species extinct and modify environments to our own ends every day. Astonishing television epics like Our Planet emphasise humanity’s overwhelming power to damage the natural world. But so much remains uncertain. In particular, while we now have a good understanding of some of the changes Earth will face in the next decades – we’ve already experienced 1°C of warming as well as increases in the frequency of floods, hurricanes and wildfires – we still struggle to predict the biological effects of our actions. In February 2019 the Bramble Cay melomys (a small Australian rodent) had the dubious honour of being named the first mammal extinct as a result of anthropogenic climate change. Others have suffered range loss, population decline and complex knock-on effects from their ecosystems changing around them. Predicting how these impacts will stack up is a significant scientific challenge. We can guess at which species are at most risk and which are safe. But we must not fall into the trap of trusting our expectations of resilience, based as they are on a specie’s current success. Our recent research aimed to test these expectations – we suspected that they would not also predict survival under changing climates, and we were right. Models of the effects of climate change on individual species are improving all the time. These are ecological niche models, which take information on where a species lives today and use it to explore where it might be found in future. For the baboon study, my masters student Sarah Hill and I modelled each of the six baboon species separately, starting in the present day. We then projected their potential ranges under 12 different future climate scenarios. Our models included two different time periods (2050 and 2070), two different degrees of projected climate change (2.6°C and 6°C of warming) and three different global climate models, each with subtly different perspectives on the Earth system. These two different degrees of warming were chosen because they represent expected “best case” and “worst case” scenarios, as modelled by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Our model outputs allowed us to calculate the change in the area of suitable habitat for each species under each scenario. Three of our species, the yellow, olive and hamadryas baboons, seemed resilient, as we initially expected. For yellow and olive baboons, suitable habitat expanded under all our scenarios. The hamadryas baboon’s habitat, meanwhile, remained stable. Guinea baboons (the only one IUCN-labelled as Near Threatened) showed a small loss. Under scenarios predicting warmer, wetter conditions, they might even gain a little. Unfortunately, models projecting warming and drying predicted that Guinea baboons could lose up to 41.5% of their suitable habitat. But Kinda baboons seemed sensitive to the same warmer and wetter conditions that might favour their Guinea baboon cousins. They were predicted to lose habitat under every model, though the loss ranged from a small one (0-22.7%) in warmer and dryer conditions to 70.2% under the worst warm and wet scenario. And the final baboon species, the chacma baboon from South Africa (the same species that are known for raiding tourist vehicles to steal treats) is predicted the worst habitat loss. Under our 12 scenarios, habitat loss was predicted to range from 32.4% to 83.5%. The IUCN identifies endangered species using estimates of population and range size and how they have changed. Although climate change impacts are recognised as potentially causing important shifts in both these factors, climate change effect models like ours are rarely included, perhaps because they are often not available. Our results suggest that in a few decades several baboon species might move into higher-risk categories. This depends on the extent of range (and hence population) loss they actually experience. New assessments will be required to see which category will apply to chacma, Kinda and Guinea baboons in 2070. It’s worth noting also that baboons are behaviourally flexible: they may yet find new ways to survive. This also has wider implications for conservation practice. First, it suggests that we should try to incorporate more climate change models into assessments of species’ prospects. Second, having cast doubt on our assumption of baboon “resilience”, our work challenges us to establish which other apparently resilient species might be similarly affected. And given that the same projected changes act differently even on closely related baboon species, we presumably need to start to assess species more or less systematically, without prior assumptions, and to try to extract new general principles about climate change impacts as we work. Sarah and I most definitely would not advocate discarding any of the existing assessment tools – the work the IUCN does is vitally important and our findings just confirm that. But our project may have identified an important additional factor affecting the prospects of even seemingly resilient species in the Anthropocene.

"Earth Day demonstrations scrapped due to the coronavirus pandemic are being replaced with digital activism via the online gaming community to exploit an as yet untapped audience for action against climate change. Earth Day, 22 April 2020, had been years in the planning but the large global demonstrations to mark the event’s 50th anniversary were brought to a halt by Covid-19. In a swift pivot from the physical action which was to have been spearheaded by half a million people gathering in Washington DC, organisers sent their movement into the digital sphere.  In an attempt to capture huge audiences they have collaborated with the online gaming community, sending messages about the need to tackle climate change. This week, the two million people who play the digital card game Solitaire Grand Harvest were greeted with climate messages and additional games designed to spur players into thinking about ways they could help the environment. The game already has a “green” tinge: players grow virtual plants and harvest crops on a “farm” in its challenges. Jillian Semaan, food and environment director at the Earth Day network, said: “We had to completely change what we were doing to mark the day, and this seemed like a natural fit with Solitaire Grand Harvest and something we were really excited about. “This is the first time we have reached out through the gaming world. Measuring success is always challenging, but what we hope is that these additional games will allow people to see that what we produce, what we consume and what we waste has an impact. “If this translates, once the lockdowns are over, into people going out and engaging more with the environment, in beach cleans, reducing waste, that is the connection we want to make.” Players of Solitaire Grand Harvest this week are greeted with the introduction: “As y’all know, our farm is full of different landscapes, just like the planet we live on. So, in honor of the International Earth Day we’ve decided to pay homage to mother nature with some special challenges, unique surprises, and HUGE rewards – all related to environmental protection and recycling.” Yuval Dor, owner of Solitaire Grand Harvest, said: “I think games are a fantastic way to deliver serious messages but in a fun way, without the feeling that you are been lectured. “In a time like this when gathering is not allowed, and many of the physical activities that usually take place are impossible, digital spaces are more relevant than ever to convince people to take action ... completing virtual missions like cleaning beaches, replanting forests and recycling competition will engage our players in a fun way, to the importance of giving back to the planet and take action, even remotely. “"

You either believe in democracy or you don’t. If you do you will accept that lobbying is an essential ingredient in the mix of factors that ensure a robust democracy. It may be that on some issues lobbying is akin to the proverbial “pushing water uphill into a headwind”, but that should never be an excuse for not participating in the process. 



The **Zero Carbon Bill** is at Select Committee and is open for submissions. They close on the 16th of July – just a few days away.



Oilers need to act.



NZIER has done some modelling (largely all based on just one paper published in 2018) that **shows massive negative impacts on our economy.** Implementing the Bill could lead to a disastrous $100 billion fall in GDP by 2050, impacting severely on the poorest people in the economy. 



It foresees a drop in exports, a 140% increase in trees (note log prices are down dramatically as northern hemisphere spruce has become available to the Chinese), and huge increases in energy prices; household incomes will be down, unemployment will increase, real wages will fall substantially and much more.



The modelling suggests that the negative effects do not change much whether the rest of the world takes strong or weak climate change action.



It then says it cannot predict what might happen if all the claims of catastrophic weather were to occur. It is silent on what might happen if no catastrophic events occur – the most likely scenario given that there have been no adverse effects from the first degree of warming. 



So we pull our pants down and take a huge hit. The rest of the world does nothing or little and there are no major weather effects so they remain in good shape. Our competitiveness is shot to pieces. Greece will look like a paradise compared to our position. It’s a bizarre outlook. No other single piece of legislation in our history will have such a dramatic and damaging effect.



 **What can Oilers do? What should Oilers do?**



Go to <https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/sc/make-a-submission/document/52SCEN_SCF_BILL_87861/climate-change-response-zero-carbon-amendment-bill> and follow instructions.



What to say?



A) Public policy involving projected massive damage to the New Zealand economy should not be made on the basis of climate models that are problematic. Even the strongest advocates of the accuracy of the models admit they are not accurate e.g. Dr Gavin Schmidt, IPCC reports, etc



Highly acclaimed scientists like Judith Curry, Roger Pielke, John Christy and Roy Spencer have produced well-researched papers pointing out the serious divergence between predictions of temperature rise and actual and why they have occurred.



B) Temperatures have risen by 0.7 to 1.0 degree C in the last 50 – 70 years depending on location, recording methods, timing, start dates etc. There is no evidence that this temperature rise has had any detrimental effects on the weather. Why should another degree cause “catastrophic” conditions?



C) Almost all record of weather events since so-called warming began, show positive gains, improvements and fewer catastrophes. 



D) Increases in CO2 have been highly beneficial to the world’s vegetation and crop outputs, helping combat hunger.



E) If New Zealand, which produces less than 0.2% of the world’s so-called man made CO2 emissions, takes drastic action and few other countries do, the detriment will be hugely exacerbated. We will become even more uncompetitive as exporters in world markets that we are reliant on more than most other countries.



F) The work output of the IPCC is largely political rather than scientific. Its very raison d’etre was not to investigate climate changes in an unbiased manner but to prove the existing meme. Funds have been made available to scientists who shout the loudest about problems arising from warming – even bizarre claims totally unrelated to weather or climate, while scientists wanting to offer theories and ideas in opposition have been closed down, under-funded, derided, squeezed out of their jobs etc. 



G) Multiple claims made over the last 50 years have not been validated. Polar bears extinct, arctic ice disappearing, falling food production, climate refugees in NZ, no more snow, etc.

With President Obama’s repeated attempts to draw distinctions between himself from his predecessor—and a widespread belief that he and Bush are polar opposites in nearly every way—it’s actually startling how similar the two men are. And if the policies match the rhetoric, it’s going to be another very long 4–8 years filled with ever more government intrusion and red ink.   




“In a system of two parties, two chambers, and two elected branches, there will always be differences and debate. But even tough debates can be conducted in a civil tone, and our differences cannot be allowed to harden into anger. To confront the great issues before us, we must act in a spirit of goodwill and respect for one another — and I will do my part. Tonight the state of our Union is strong, and together we will make it stronger.”   
  
  
  
–George W. Bush, 2006 SOTU 



“Since 2001, we have spent nearly $10 billion to develop cleaner, cheaper, and more reliable alternative energy sources. And we are on the threshold of incredible advances. So tonight I announce the Advanced Energy Initiative — a 22‐​percent increase in clean‐​energy research — at the Department of Energy, to push for breakthroughs in two vital areas. To change how we power our homes and offices, we will invest more in zero‐​emission coal‐​fired plants, revolutionary solar and wind technologies, and clean, safe nuclear energy.”   
  
  
  
–George W. Bush, 2006 SOTU 



“I have sent you a comprehensive energy plan to promote energy efficiency and conservation, to develop cleaner technology, and to produce more energy at home. I have sent you Clear Skies legislation that mandates a 70‐​percent cut in air pollution from powerplants over the next 15 years.”   
  
  
  
–George W. Bush, 2003 SOTU 



“Keeping America competitive requires affordable health care. Our Government has a responsibility to provide health care for the poor and the elderly, and we are meeting that responsibility. For all Americans, we must confront the rising cost of care, strengthen the doctor‐​patient relationship, and help people afford the insurance coverage they need.”   
  
  
  
–George W. Bush, 2006 SOTU 



“In 2 weeks, I will send you a budget that funds the war, protects the homeland, and meets important domestic needs while limiting the growth in discretionary spending to less than 4 percent. This will require that Congress focus on priorities, cut wasteful spending, and be wise with the people’s money. By doing so, we can cut the deficit in half over the next 5 years.”   
  
  
  
–George W. Bush, 2004 SOTU



“My budget substantially reduces or eliminates more than 150 government programs that are not getting results, or duplicate current efforts, or do not fulfill essential priorities. The principle here is clear: a taxpayer dollar must be spent wisely, or not at all.”   
  
  
  
–George W. Bush, 2005 SOTU 



“The people’s trust in their Government is undermined by congressional earmarks, special interest projects that are often snuck in at the last minute, without discussion or debate. Last year, I asked you to voluntarily cut the number and cost of earmarks in half. I also asked you to stop slipping earmarks into committee reports that never even come to a vote. Unfortunately, neither goal was met. So this time, if you send me an appropriations bill that does not cut the number and cost of earmarks in half, I’ll send it back to you with my veto. And tomorrow I will issue an Executive order that directs Federal Agencies to ignore any future earmark that is not voted on by Congress. If these items are truly worth funding, Congress should debate them in the open and hold a public vote.”   
  
  
  
–George W. Bush, 2008 SOTU

Today’s crybaby of the week would have to be Crim Hugger, Climate Logic Denier and ‘Premium’ (lol) content supplier to _A Newspaper_ , Jarrod Gilbert.



Quite how _A Newspaper_ could deem this week’s pathetic diatribe from Gilbert as premium content that one should pay for is beyond me, but since their paywall is about as holey as a Swiss cheese resting on a sponge in the Vatican, as a service to all you good folk out there, I sacrificed two minutes of my life and had a read.



“Just FYI, if you recline your seat on a plane, you are an ass. If you recline your seat on a plane and don’t think you’re an ass, read this tweet again.” 



  
Mr Gilbert being a Climate Alarmist, I’m not sure what he was doing on a plane, given that they are the primary cause of skinny polar bears – but I digress.



I won’t bore you with all of the sordid details but you can take it as read that…



And perhaps I should add, 4. Mr Gilbert is a cheapskate, given that all you have to do on a local flight around New Zealand would be to pay $10 to upgrade to exit row 12 on the 737s which not only has heaps of legroom but also is behind row 11 which, also being an exit row, cannot recline! But even better, row 12 seats can recline themselves so if he chose to be a Ass himself, he could flick his own seat back as hypocrites are wont to do.



And if Mr Gilbert is a frequent flier of sufficient import, he would be allowed to sit up near the front of the plane where there is much better legroom anyway. 



Although surely there is no such thing as a Greenie with a Gold Status; I can’t imagine there would be any such hypocritical people on this fragile planet.



So anyway, it’s time to front up. Let’s have a wee poll.



Are you an Ass, who reclines, or an Asshat, who hates those guys? I’ll start, put me down as an Ass.

By WUWT regular “Just The Facts”
I am often amused by claims that we understand Earth’s climate system, are able to accurately measure its behavior, eliminate all potential variables except CO2 as the primary driver of Earth’s temperature and make predictions of Earth’s temperature decades into the future, all with a high degree of confidence. I have been studying Earth’s climate system for several years and have found it to be a ridiculously complex, continually evolving and sometimes chaotic beast. Furthermore, our understanding of Earth’s climate system is currently rudimentary at best, our measurement capabilities are limited and our historical record is laughably brief. To help demonstrate the complexity of Earth’s climate system I have been compiling a list of all of the variables potentially involved in Earth’s climate system. This is a work in progress so additions, recommendations, corrections, questions etc. are most welcome. Once I develop this further and polish it up a bit I plan to convert it into a new WUWT Reference Page.
UPDATED: This list has undergone significant revisions and improvements based upon crowdsourcing the input of an array of very intelligent and knowledgeable contributors below. Additionally, this list was posted in comments in WUWT a few times previously, receiving input from a number of other very intelligent and knowledgeable contributors. This thread, along with links to the precursor threads below, will thus serve as the bibliography for the forthcoming WUWT Potential Climatic Variables reference page (unless someone can up with a better name for it…:)

“By analyzing the minute changes in travel times and wave shapes for each doublet, the researchers concluded that the Earth’s inner core is rotating faster than its surface by about 0.3-0.5 degrees per year.
That may not seem like much, but it’s very fast compared to the movement of the Earth’s crust, which generally slips around only a few centimeters per year compared to the mantle below, said Xiaodong Song, a geologist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and an author on the study.
http://www.livescience.com/9313-earth-core-rotates-faster-surface-study-confirms.html

“The presence of the moon (which has about 1/81 the mass of the Earth), is slowing Earth’s rotation and lengthening the day by about 2 ms every one hundred years.”
“However some large scale events, such as the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, have caused the rotation to speed up by around 3 microseconds.[21] Post-glacial rebound, ongoing since the last Ice age, is changing the distribution of the Earth’s mass thus affecting the Moment of Inertia of the Earth and, by the Conservation of Angular Momentum, the Earth’s rotation period.”

This is well-trodden ground. Nothing new to add, just the same old, tired arguments. Perhaps a note on EUV: as you can see here (slide 13)
http://lasp.colorado.edu/sorce/news/2008ScienceMeeting/doc/Session1/S1_03_Kopp.pdf the energy in the EUV band [and other UV bands] is very tiny; many orders of magnitude less than what shines down on our heads each day. So a larger solar cycle variation of EUV does not make any significant difference in the energy budget.

including in the infamous Year Without a Summer;
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_Without_a_Summer
which was partially caused by the 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora;
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1815_eruption_of_Mount_Tambora
and is called a Volcanic Winter:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_winter
“Volcanic Ash;

The finest Tephera;
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tephra
remain in the stratosphere for only a few months, they have only minor climatic effects, and they can be spread around the world by high-altitude winds. This suspended material contributes to spectacular sunsets.
“The greatest volcanic impact upon the earth’s short term weather patterns is caused by sulfur dioxide gas;”
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur_dioxide
“In the cold lower atmosphere, it is converted to Sulfuric Acid;
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfuric_acid
sulfuric acid by the sun’s rays reacting with stratospheric water vapor to form sulfuric acid aerosol layers. The aerosol remains in suspension long after solid ash particles have fallen to earth and forms a layer of sulfuric acid droplets between 15 to 25 kilometers up. Fine ash particles from an eruption column fall out too quickly to significantly cool the atmosphere over an extended period of time, no matter how large the eruption.
Sulfur aerosols last many years, and several historic eruptions show a good correlation of sulfur dioxide layers in the atmosphere with a decrease in average temperature decrease of subsequent years. The close correlation was first established after the 1963 eruption of Agung volcano in Indonesia when it was found that sulfur dioxide reached the stratosphere and stayed as a sulfuric acid aerosol.
Without replenishment, the sulfuric acid aerosol layer around the earth is gradually depleted, but it is renewed by each eruption rich in sulfur dioxide. This was confirmed by data collected after the eruptions of El Chichon, Mexico (1982) and Pinatubo, Philippines (1991), both of which were high-sulfur compound carriers like Agung, Indonesia.”
http://volcanology.geol.ucsb.edu/gas.htm
There is also some evidence that if “volcanic activity was high enough, then a water vapor anomaly would be introduced into the lower stratosphere before the anomaly due to the previous eruption had disappeared. The result would be threefold in the long term: stratospheric cooling, stratospheric humidification, and surface warming due to the positive radiative forcing associated with the water vapor.”

“Emission rates of [Sulfur Dioxide] SO2 from an active volcano range from 10 million tonnes/day according to the style of volcanic activity and type and volume of magma involved. For example, the large explosive eruption of Mount Pinatubo on 15 June 1991 expelled 3-5 km3 of dacite magma and injected about 20 million metric tons of SO2 into the stratosphere. The sulfur aerosols resulted in a 0.5-0.6°C cooling of the Earth’s surface in the Northern Hemisphere.”

“The 1815 eruption [of Mount Tambora] is rated 7 on the Volcanic Explosivity Index, the only such eruption since the Lake Taupo eruption in about 180 AD. With an estimated ejecta volume of 160 cubic kilometers, Tambora’s 1815 outburst was the largest volcanic eruption in recorded history.”

University of Toronto Mississauga professor wins Ig Nobel Prize for beer, sex research
A male Australian jewel beetle attempts to mate with a ""stubby"" beer bottle. Credit: Darryl Gwynne
It was a case of a besotted male and beer. Love-sick and lonely, the male girded his loins and took immediate action to relieve his unhappiness – but with a surprising outcome, as a U of T Mississauga professor discovered.
The male in question, an Australian jewel beetle (Julodimorpha bakewelli), became so enamored with a brown “stubby” beer bottle that he tried to mate with it – so vigorously that he died trying to copulate in the hot sun rather than leave willingly, says Professor Darryl Gwynne of biology, an international expert in behavioural ecology, specifically the evolution of reproductive behaviour. 
Today, Gwynne and his Australian colleague David Rentz were awarded an Ig Nobel Prize at Harvard University for their 1983 paper “Beetles on the Bottle: Male Buprestids Mistake Stubbies for Females.” The Ig Nobel Prizes, a parody of the Nobel Prizes, are awarded annually by the scientific humour magazine Annals of Improbable Research to “first make people laugh and then make them think.” The prizes are intended to celebrate the unusual, honour the imaginative and spur people’s interest in science, medicine and technology.
“I’m honoured, I think,” Gwynne says, with a smile on his face. “The awards make people think, and they’re a bit of a laugh. Really, we’ve been sitting here by the phone for the past 20 plus years waiting for the call. Why did it take them so long?”
Gwynne and Rentz were conducting field work in Western Australia 23 years ago when they noticed something unusual along the side of the road. “We were walking along a dirt road with the usual scattering of beer cans and bottles when we saw about six bottles with beetles on top or crawling up the side. It was clear the beetles were trying to mate with the bottles.”
The bottles – stubbies as they are known in Australia – resemble a “super female” jewel beetle, Gwynne says: big and orangey brown in colour, with a slightly dimpled surface near the bottom (designed to prevent the bottle from slipping out of one’s grasp) that reflects light in much the same way as female wing covers. The bottles proved irresistible to males. Ignoring the females, the males mounted or tried to climb up the bottles, refusing to leave. They fried to death in the sun, were eaten by hungry ants or had to be physically removed by the researchers.
Gwynne and Rentz determined that the males were attracted only to stubbies – not to beer cans or wine bottles of a slightly different shade of brown. And it wasn’t the bottles’ contents that captured their attention: “Not only do western Australians never dispose of a beer bottle with beer still in it, but many of the bottles had sand and detritus accumulated over many months,” the research paper notes.
Beer and sex humour aside, the research has serious messages, Gwynne says. First, when humans interfere – perhaps unwittingly – in an evolutionary process, there can be unintended consequences; in this case, female beetles are ignored by males which can have a huge impact on the natural world. “Improperly disposed of beer bottles not only present a physical and ‘visual’ hazard in the environment, but also could potentially cause great interference with the mating system of a beetle species,” the paper says. To that end, Gwynne forwarded research results to a leading western Australian brewer.
And secondly, Gwynne points out that the research supports the theory of sexual selection: that males, in their eagerness to mate, are the ones that make mating mistakes.
Gwynne conducted his research as a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Western Australia in Nedlands. He joined U of T Mississauga in 1987. The research was published in the journal of the Entomological Society of Australia and the U.K.-based journal, Antenna.

"**A boy who wrote to Boris Johnson to ask whether Santa would be able to come this year has been reassured presents will be delivered as normal.**
Eight-year-old Monti from Cockermouth, Cumbria, wrote to the prime minister asking if the government had ""thought about Santa coming this Christmas"".
Mr Johnson replied saying he had put in a call to the North Pole and Father Christmas is ""ready and raring to go"".
Monti said he was ""shocked"" the ""busiest man in the country"" replied.
In the letter, Monti also asked if the family should put measures in place to help stop the spread of Covid-19.
""In June I heard the pandemic might go on for a long time and it could reach up to Christmas,"" he said.
""I got a bit worried so I wondered if I should write to the prime minister, so I did.
""I asked him if everyone has to put hand sanitiser by the cookies and if he can actually come and keep the Christmas spirit alive.
""If the Christmas spirit isn't kept alive then no one will be happy.""
Mr Johnson replied: ""Leaving hand sanitiser by the cookies is an excellent idea to help prevent the spread of the virus.
""Thank you again for your letter, and have a very Merry Christmas.""
Mum Abby said: ""We just needed some reassurance that Father Christmas was going to still be able to deliver all of his presents across the world.
""Monti was really excited, not just with the letter from the prime minister, but with reassurance from Santa that he is going to be able to deliver on Christmas Eve, we're just very excited now.""

"We have been living in a bubble, a bubble of false comfort and denial. In the rich nations, we have begun to believe we have transcended the material world. The wealth we’ve accumulated – often at the expense of others – has shielded us from reality. Living behind screens, passing between capsules – our houses, cars, offices and shopping malls – we persuaded ourselves that contingency had retreated, that we had reached the point all civilisations seek: insulation from natural hazards. Now the membrane has ruptured, and we find ourselves naked and outraged, as the biology we appeared to have banished storms through our lives. The temptation, when this pandemic has passed, will be to find another bubble. We cannot afford to succumb to it. From now on, we should expose our minds to the painful realities we have denied for too long.  The planet has multiple morbidities, some of which will make this coronavirus look, by comparison, easy to treat. One above all others has come to obsess me in recent years: how will we feed ourselves? Fights over toilet paper are ugly enough: I hope we never have to witness fights over food. But it’s becoming difficult to see how we will avoid them. A large body of evidence is beginning to accumulate showing how climate breakdown is likely to affect our food supply. Already farming in some parts of the world is being hammered by drought, floods, fire and locusts (whose resurgence in the past few weeks appears to be the result of anomalous tropical cyclones). When we call such hazards “biblical”, we mean that they are the kind of things that happened long ago, to people whose lives we can scarcely imagine. Now, with increasing frequency, they are happening to us. In his forthcoming book, Our Final Warning, Mark Lynas explains what is likely to happen to our food supply with every extra degree of global heating. He finds that extreme danger kicks in somewhere between 3C and 4C above pre-industrial levels. At this point, a series of interlocking impacts threatens to send food production into a death spiral. Outdoor temperatures become too high for humans to tolerate, making subsistence farming impossible across Africa and South Asia. Livestock die from heat stress. Temperatures start to exceed the lethal thresholds for crop plants across much of the world, and major food producing regions turn into dust bowls. Simultaneous global harvest failure – something that has never happened in the modern world – becomes highly likely. In combination with a rising human population, and the loss of irrigation water, soil and pollinators, this could push the world into structural famine. Even today, when the world has a total food surplus, hundreds of millions are malnourished as a result of the unequal distribution of wealth and power. A food deficit could result in billions starving. Hoarding will happen, as it always has, at the global level, as powerful people snatch food from the mouths of the poor. Yet, even if every nation keeps its promises under the Paris agreement, which currently seems unlikely, global heating will amount to between 3C and 4C. Thanks to our illusion of security, we are doing almost nothing to anticipate this catastrophe, let alone prevent it. This existential issue scarcely seems to impinge on our consciousness. Every food-producing sector claims that its own current practices are sustainable and don’t need to change. When I challenge them, I’m met with a barrage of anger and abuse, and threats of the kind I haven’t experienced since I opposed the Iraq war. Sacred cows and holy lambs are everywhere, and the thinking required to develop the new food systems that we need, like lab-grown food, is scarcely anywhere. But this is just one of our impending crises. Antibiotic resistance is, potentially, as deadly as any new disease. One of the causes is the astonishingly profligate way in which these precious medicines are used on many livestock farms. Where vast numbers of farm animals are packed together, antibiotics are deployed prophylactically to prevent otherwise inevitable outbreaks of disease. In some parts of the world, they are used not only to prevent disease, but also as growth promoters. Low doses are routinely added to feed: a strategy that could scarcely be better designed to deliver bacterial resistance. In the US, where 27 million people have no medical cover, some people are now treating themselves with veterinary antibiotics, including those sold, without prescription, to medicate pet fish. Pharmaceutical companies are failing to invest sufficiently in the search for new drugs. If antibiotics cease to be effective, surgery becomes almost impossible. Childbirth becomes a mortal hazard once more. Chemotherapy can no longer be safely practised. Infectious diseases we have comfortably forgotten become deadly threats. We should discuss this issue as often as we talk about football. But again, it scarcely registers. Our multiple crises, of which these are just two, have a common root. The problem is exemplified by the response of the organisers of the Bath Half Marathon, a massive event that took place on 15 March, to the many people begging them to cancel. “It is now too late for us to cancel or postpone the event. The venue is built, the infrastructure is in place, the site and our contractors are ready.” In other words, the sunk costs of the event were judged to outweigh any future impacts – the potential transmission of disease, and possible deaths – it might cause. The amount of time it took the International Olympic Committee to postpone the Games could reflect similar judgments – but at least they got there in the end. Sunk costs within the fossil fuel industry, farming, banking, private healthcare and other sectors prevent the rapid transformations we need. Money becomes more important than life. There are two ways this could go. We could, as some people have done, double down on denial. Some of those who have dismissed other threats, such as climate breakdown, also seek to downplay the threat of Covid-19. Witness the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, who claims that the coronavirus is nothing more than “a little flu”. The media and opposition politicians who have called for lockdown are, apparently, part of a conspiracy against him. Or this could be the moment when we begin to see ourselves, once more, as governed by biology and physics, and dependent on a habitable planet. Never again should we listen to the liars and the deniers. Never again should we allow a comforting falsehood to trounce a painful truth. No longer can we afford to be dominated by those who put money ahead of life. This coronavirus reminds us that we belong to the material world. • George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist"

UPDATE: It is official now, here’s a screencap from the Bloggies page:
I really like the fact that they used a thermometer in the design.
===============================================================
This was truly surprising. According to the Bloggies Facebook page, WUWT has been named the first ever winner of the Best Science Blog category (new this year for the Bloggies), beating Wired and Boing Boing, both of whom have way more reach and traffic than we do. I suppose it demonstrates the loyalty of our readers.

I have no idea as to the votes or margins, all that remains hidden, and probably for good measure. No voting wars broke out with this contest like we saw with Climate Audit and Bad Astronomy in 2007, and that’s a good thing.
I’ll make no speeches like Sally Field’s famous 1984 Oscar speech: “You like me, you really like me!” which is actually a misquote, and a popular parody.
I’ll simply say “thank you dear readers”, and leave it at that. I also owe thanks to the many moderators and guest bloggers that make WUWT what it is. You are winners too.
I have a temporary badge up, a permanent one follows when they have it all completed. The main page here http://2011.bloggi.es should have the announcement soon – Anthony

"The ineffective burning of wood in traditional stoves means that more people die around the world from pollution indoors than outdoors. There are simple, cleaner alternatives for sale, but encouraging the purchase of them has proved difficult. A project in India, however, is using rural women’s social networks to successfully change the situation and those selling improved stoves can learn from that project. A recent report from the World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates around 4.3m deaths globally in 2012 due to indoor air pollution and almost all of them in low and middle income countries. In comparison, outdoor air pollution led to 2.6m deaths.  The WHO report believes that nearly three billion poor people, who rely on solid fuels for cooking and heating, are at risk of being affected by indoor pollution. Nearly 50% deaths among children under five in underdeveloped countries are the result of acute lower respiratory infections caused by indoor pollution in the form of carbon monoxide and particulate matter generated by burning biomass. Such biomass is the cheapest and most widely available fuel. Continuous exposure to such indoor pollution can lead to other health problems. Women – who spend more time near stoves – are particularly badly affected. One solution to changing this is to use improved stoves. In most countries, these are available from governments and charities. Some provide them for free, but most places offer it at subsidised prices.  Improved stoves come in different designs, but the main idea is to ensure that the fuel is burned effectively, so that it does not create soot or toxic carbon monoxide. This is achieved by improving airflow near the site where the fuel is burnt. Some designs allow the removal of gases released from the burning fuel away from the person sitting near the stove. The health benefits are usually long term, so people don’t always opt for the purchase even at subsidised rates. Even when they are provided for free, a lot of the people quickly stop using them.  The Indian government’s National Program on Improved Cookstoves is a good example of the kind of government-led stove interventions that can go wrong. Although there was money available for the program, it failed because of poor stove design, misunderstanding of the community’s needs and poor distribution networks. NGOs do better, but often don’t have enough financial support. Project Shakti, a programme launched by Hindustan Unilever, has found a way to use women’s social networks to bring about behaviour change and drive communities to adopt new products. Important insights can be drawn through this case and can be applied for sustained dissemination of improved cookstoves among such poor communities. The project recruits influential women in rural communities who are called Shakti Ammas, where Shakti means “power” and Amma means “mother”. These Shakti Ammas have strong social network partnership with the other women in their communities. While earning a living from this programme, these Shakti Ammas influence the opinions of the peers in their networks.  In a country with the largest informal labour market, women often don’t find decent wages for their work. That is why even a small income can be a good driver. In this case, the influence leads to the purchase of Hindustan Unilever’s products, such as washing powders, soaps, shampoos or toothpastes, among the rural women in their networks. But there is much to learn from this marketing strategy to help other not-for-profit ideas to spread. Penetrating the rural market in India has remained a big challenge because that population tends not to consume media and advertising in the way that  urban folks do. But Project Shakti has been successful where most have failed. The strategy has been so effective that by 2013, more than 40,000 Shakti Ammas are working in 15 Indian states and these informal networks are changing behaviour in more than 100,000 villages. Project Shakti provides two important insights for an effective dissemination of ideas and products. First, the influence of the group leader in informal community based networks has a marked prominence in dissemination of new products. Second, influential women within these social networks can become powerful agents to change traditions, culture, and social norms and can facilitate the uptake of new, cleaner products. These insights and cases such as Project Shakti are highly relevant to research studies focusing on the dissemination of improved cookstoves and eventually for causing a behavioural change among the rural communities to sustainably use these improved stoves.

"**Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday evening. We'll have another update for you on Saturday morning.**
The coronavirus R number has fallen to between 0.9 and 1 in the UK for the first time since mid-August. The estimate from the government's scientific advisers suggests the epidemic is no longer growing and could even be falling. However, cases in some regions of England are still high, particularly the North West, the North East and Yorkshire and the Humber. It comes as England prepares to leave lockdown on 2 December and enter a revised system of tiered restrictions. You can read about what the R number is and why it's important here and check for case numbers in your area here.
The prime minister has defended the government's decision to place 55 million people in England into the two highest levels of Covid restrictions amid unrest from some MPs in his own party. Boris Johnson said the measures were more ""relaxed"" than the lockdown and would ""drive"" infection rates down until a vaccine is available. But the Covid Recovery Group of Conservative MPs, which claims to have 70 members, is threatening a revolt in next Tuesday's Commons vote on the plans. It raises the possibility of the government requiring Labour votes to get the measures approved. Here we answer some of your questions about what happens when the lockdown ends, and here we cover the rules in each tier.
Sir Philip Green's retail empire Arcadia is understood to be on the brink of collapse, placing 13,000 jobs at risk. The firm, whose brands include Topshop, Burton and Dorothy Perkins, said the pandemic ""has had a material impact on trading across our businesses"". It had been in talks with potential lenders about borrowing Â£30m to help the business through Christmas. But these have failed and administrators could be appointed on Monday. Read here about what went wrong at Arcadia's flagship brand Topshop.
The Christmas school holidays could be extended in Scotland, it has emerged. Discussions have been taking place about standardising dates across the country, so that all schools close on 18 December and reopen on 11 January. While most schools are set to close on 18 December, others are due to be open until 23 December, with the majority planning to return between 5 and 7 January. A memo, leaked to the Daily Record, says that extending the holidays would act as a break following the relaxation of Covid rules over the festive period.
The landlords of two pubs that are in the same village and are just 0.4 miles apart have described the Covid tiers as ""perplexing"" after learning that one can reopen next week while the other has to stay shut. Groombridge sits on the border of East Sussex and Kent, which will enter tiers two and three respectively next week. Because the Junction is in East Sussex it can reopen, while the Crown Inn in Kent will remain closed. Steve Harmes, at the Crown, said it was ""horrendous"" while the Junction's Tiffany Pearson-Gills called it ""perplexing"".

So the Wellington City Council has passed its 20 year transport plan to bring mass transit and other transport improvements to the capital. The councillors have all patted one another on the back, calling this a ‘game changer’ and ‘climate change in action’… and that should send shivers down the spine of every Wellington ratepayer. There is good reason; the WCC’s shiny new transport policy is centred around… wait for it… getting more people cycling, walking and onto public transport. 



Wellington City Council has joined the regional council in passing a 20-year transport plan to bring mass transit and other transport improvements to Wellington.  
Brian Dawson called Let’s Get Wellington Moving “a game-changer”, Iona Pannett said it was “climate change action in practice”, Simon Woolf exclaimed that Minister Phil Twyford had “shown us the money”, and Deputy Mayor Jill Day told colleagues they risked over-consulting the public if they didn’t pass it.  
 **At the end of it all, councillors were unanimous in approving the $6.4 billion LGWM plan to unblock congestion between Ngauranga Gorge and the airport by getting more people walking, cycling and using public transport.**



Wow, that really is a game changer. Try walking up Ngauranga Gorge… or cycling down it. Try getting your children to school on the back of a bike. Try getting to the other end of town from the Hutt Valley in less than 2 hours on public transport. Oh, and let’s not forget those wonderful changes to the Wellington bus timetable last year that turned a normal 20 minute commute into a 2 hour journey with 3 bus changes for some commuters. I see the lunatics are still running the asylum at Wellington City Council.



Opening the debate Mayor Justin Lester evoked Wellington’s history of transport “misadventures and missed opportunities” in a bid to encourage his fellow councillors to vote LGWM in without any amendments that would change the “indicative package” approved by cabinet. 



He exhaustively took councillors through the tunnels that had been aborted and the roading projects left undone as governments and Wellington councils changed direction. 



**“I want to send a strong signal to cabinet that Wellington has finally got it’s s..t together.”**



There is certainly a lot of bovine excrement in this proposal, but whether it is ‘together’ or hitting fans all over the place is a matter of opinion.



The vote gives the green light to **a number of “early delivery” projects including: a central city walking programme, cycling improvements, lower speeds in the CBD, a**[ **pedestrian crossing on Cobham Dr**](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/112904407/traffic-lights-preferred-option-for-pedestrian-crossing-on-busy-route-to-wellington-airport) **,** and bus priority on Thorndon Quay, Hutt Rd and the Golden Mile.[ ](https://www.stuff.co.nz/authors/dileepa-fonseka)



Yep. Pedestrian crossings on Cobham Drive – that’s the main route from town to the airport for non-Wellington people – will really ‘get Wellington moving’. An already heavily congested area is about to become even more heavily congested.



You really couldn’t make this stuff up.



In the longer term council voted to approve investigations and business cases into rapid transit to the airport, an extra Mt Victoria tunnel, Basin Reserve roading traffic separating improvements, walkability projects, cycleways through the city from Kent Terrace to Bowen St, turning the Golden Mile and Waterfront Quays into a dual public transport spine, and integrated ticketing across public transport systems. 



So there is some extra roading in the long term plan, but, Wellington needs it now. If the Melling (Lower Hutt) plan is anything to go by, where a rickety bridge built in the 1930s is scheduled to be replaced in 2028, let’s not get our hopes up for a second Mt Victoria tunnel just yet.



Diane Calvert, proposed over a dozen amendments – including a request for a regional fuel tax, expedited Basin Reserve improvements and the a quicker start to the second Mt Victoria tunnel – and said WCC should still push for more even if it angered the government. 



Great idea, Diane. Let’s fleece motorists even further while giving them nothing but vague promises about road improvements next century. That will make your ratepayers happy.



And Andy Foster argued there wasn’t enough detail in the LGWM proposal, that it was unaffordable and wouldn’t improve transport outcomes for everyone across the city.  
 **“If you’re a motorist it’s actually not going to get Wellington moving.”**



  
At least somebody gets it. Just about all walkers and cyclists at some point are motorists too, and a cyclist in Wellington City really does take his life into his own hands on some of those terribly congested roads. More cycleways will just make them even more congested. Nobody seems to get this.



During the last local council election campaign, there were signs everywhere from prospective councillors, saying things like ‘4 Lanes to the Planes’ and “Let’s Get Wellington Moving”… and the same bunch of Green zealots were voted back in. Since then, they have created rainbow crossings, declared a climate emergency and done away with Guy Fawkes. Wellington gets more and more congested by the day, and no one is doing anything about it. This ‘game changing’ plan will do nothing about it either.



Come on Wellington. Let’s vote these clowns out before the entire city is brought to a grinding halt. We are almost there now. Let’s really do something before the city is damaged by these idiots forever.

Fossilized pollen reveals climate history of northern Antarctica
Analysis of direct climate record shows Antarctic tundra persisted until 12 million years ago
HOUSTON — (June 27, 2011) — A painstaking examination of the first direct and detailed climate record from the continental shelves surrounding Antarctica reveals that the last remnant of Antarctic vegetation existed in a tundra landscape on the continent’s northern peninsula about 12 million years ago. The research, which was led by researchers at Rice University and Louisiana State University, appears online this week and will be featured on the cover of the July 12 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
The new study contains the most detailed reconstruction to date of the climatic history of the Antarctic Peninsula, which has warmed significantly in recent decades. The rapid decline of glaciers along the peninsula has led to widespread speculation about how the rest of the continent’s ice sheets will react to rising global temperatures.

“The best way to predict future changes in the behavior of Antarctic ice sheets and their influence on climate is to understand their past,” said Rice University marine geologist John Anderson, the study’s lead author. The study paints the most detailed picture to date of how the Antarctic Peninsula first succumbed to ice during a prolonged period of global cooling.
In the warmest period in Earth’s past 55 million years, Antarctica was ice-free and forested. The continent’s vast ice sheets, which today contain more than two-thirds of Earth’s freshwater, began forming about 38 million years ago. The Antarctic Peninsula, which juts farther north than the rest of the continent, was the last part of Antarctica to succumb to ice. It’s also the part that has experienced the most dramatic warming in recent decades; its mean annual temperatures rose as much as six times faster than mean annual temperatures worldwide.

“There’s a longstanding debate about how rapidly glaciation progressed in Antarctica,” said Sophie Warny, a Louisiana State University geologist who specializes in palynology (the study of fossilized pollen and spores) and led the palynological reconstruction. “We found that the fossil record was unambiguous; glacial expansion in the Antarctic Peninsula was a long, gradual process that was influenced by atmospheric, tectonic and oceanographic changes.”
Warny, her students and colleague Rosemary Askin were able to ascertain the exact species of plants that existed on the peninsula over the past 36 million years after a painstaking, three-year examination of thousands of individual grains of pollen that were preserved in muddy sediments beneath the sea floor just off the coast.
“The pollen record in the sedimentary layers was beautiful, both in its richness and depth,” Warny said. “It allowed us to construct a detailed picture of the rapid decline of the forests during the late Eocene — about 35 million years ago — and the widespread glaciation that took place in the middle Miocene — about 13 million years ago.”
Obtaining the sedimentary samples wasn’t easy. The muddy treasure trove was locked away beneath almost 100 feet of dense sedimentary rock. It was also off the coast of the peninsula in shallow waters that are covered by ice most of the year and beset by icebergs the rest. Anderson, a veteran of more than 25 research expeditions to Antarctica, and colleagues spent more than a decade building a case for the funding to outfit an icebreaker with the right kind of drilling equipment to bore through the rock.

In 2002, the National Science Foundation (NSF) funded the project, which was dubbed SHALDRIL. Three years later, the NSF research vessel Nathaniel B. Palmer left on the first of two drilling cruises.
“It was the worst ice year that any of us could remember,” Anderson said. “We’d spend most of a day lowering drill string to the ocean floor only to pull it back up to get out of the way of approaching icebergs.”
The next year was little better, but the SHALDRIL team managed to obtain enough core samples to cover the past 36 million years, thanks to the logistical planning of marine geologist Julia Wellner and to the skill of the drilling crew. By end of the second season, Anderson said, the crew could drill as much as a meter every five minutes.
Reconstructing a detailed climate record from the sample was another Herculean task. In addition to the three-year palynological analysis at LSU, University of Southampton palaeoceanographer Steven Bohaty led an effort to nail down the precise age of the various sediments in each core sample. Wellner, now at the University of Houston, examined the characteristics of the sediments to determine whether they formed below an ice sheet, in open marine conditions or in a combined glacial-marine setting. Other members of the team had to count, categorize and even examine the surface texture of thousands of sand grains that were preserved in the sediments. Gradually, the team was able to piece together a history of how much of the peninsula was covered by glaciers throughout the past 36 million years.
“SHALDRIL gave us the first reliable age constraints on the timing of ice sheet advance across the northern peninsula,” Anderson said. “The rich mosaic of organic and geologic material that we found in the sedimentary record has given us a much clearer picture of the climatic history of the Antarctic Peninsula. This type of record is invaluable as we struggle to place in context the rapid changes that we see taking place in the peninsula today.”
###
The study was funded by grants from the NSF’s Office of Polar Programs to Anderson and Warny. Study co-authors include Wellner; Askin; Bohaty; Alexandra Kirshner, Tyler Smith and Fred Weaver, all of Rice; Alexander Simms and Daniel Livsey, both of the University of California, Santa Barbara; Werner Ehrmann of the University of Leipzig; Lawrence Lawver of the University of Texas at Austin; David Barbeau of the University of South Carolina; Sherwood Wise and Denise Kulhenek, both of Florida State University; and Wojciech Majewski of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

"**Drinkers visiting pubs in tier two regions will have to leave when they finish eating, under new restrictions being introduced from 2 December, No 10 has confirmed.**
Under the post-lockdown guidance, pubs in those high risk areas can only open if they function as a restaurant.
And alcohol can only be served as part of a ""substantial meal"".
Pubs and restaurants are currently closed across England, apart from for takeaways.
The prime minister's official spokesman, asked how long drinkers can stay in a pub after buying a meal, said: ""We've been clear that, in tier two I believe, that you need to have a substantial meal if ordering any alcohol and it remains the case that the guidance says that once the meal is finished, it is at that point [you have to leave].""
When the current lockdown ends, the rules will change according to where you live.
In tier two regions, pubs and restaurants must shut at 23:00 GMT, with last orders an hour earlier.
You can only socialise inside with people you live with, or those in your support bubble if you live alone. Groups of up to six can meet outside, but social distancing must be adhered to.
In tier three, very high risk areas, you cannot mix with anyone outside your household either indoors or in pub gardens or private gardens. Hospitality venues - such as bars, pubs, cafes and restaurants - must stay closed, except for delivery and takeaway services.
In tier one, medium level, people can meet inside or outside in groups of up to six. Most of England is in tier two or three, however, with only Cornwall, the Isle of Wight and Isles of Scilly in tier one.
Stricter measures for pubs, restaurants and bars will come into force in Wales on 4 December, it was announced on Friday.
Northern Ireland is currently in a two-week circuit-breaker lockdown, with cafes, coffee shops, pubs, bars and restaurants closed, except for takeaways and deliveries. And in Scotland, the rules on pubs and restaurants depend where your region is placed in the four-tier system."

On Tuesday, President Barack Obama signed into law the Economic Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 — “the stimulus bill,” as the newspapers say. In the debate over the bill, a forcefully poised Obama warned of the danger that “our nation will sink deeper into a crisis that, at some point, we may not be able to reverse.” Our best chance to arrest this potentially apocalyptic decline, he maintained, is a massive government‐​led mobilization of taxpayer resources. And this is precisely what we are getting. At the signing ceremony in Denver, the president declared the $738 billion stimulus plan “the most sweeping economic recovery package in our history.” So will it work?



“Stimulus is not part of the language of economics,” says Arizona State University economics professor Edward Prescott. I talked to Prescott just hours before Obama set the presidential pen to the stimulus bill. “There is an old, discarded theory that’s been tried and failed spectacularly, which is where that language of stimulus comes from.” The stimulus bill, Prescott told me, “is likely to depress the economy.” Not long after Obama wowed the nation with his keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, Edward Prescott traveled to Stockholm to receive a Nobel Prize, shared with his frequent collaborator Finn Kydland, “for contributions to dynamic macroeconomics: the time consistency of economic policy and the driving forces behind business cycles.” Which is to say, Prescott is one of his discipline’s most influential and authoritative voices on precisely those technical issues behind the stimulus debate.



The most recent Nobel Prize awarded for work specifically in macroeconomics–the branch of economics that studies aggregate economic phenomena, the causes of recessions, and the effectiveness of government attempts to stimulate economic performance–went to Columbia University’s Edmund Phelps in 2006. When I spoke to Phelps on Tuesday, he was rather less emphatically decisive than was Prescott about the dire prospects of the stimulus. But neither was he optimistic. “We’re completely flying blind,” Phelps said, suggesting that even the best of the best in macroeconomics don’t know enough to predict with confidence how the stimulus will pan out. “There’s a chance that some of the infrastructure spending will do the job of creating more work for earth‐​moving equipment and construction workers, Phelps noted. “I said, ‘a chance’,” he continued. “Now, there’s also a chance that the perceived increase in the role of government of this sort will have some unanticipated effects on the animal spirits of entrepreneurs. These projects may stand as a sort of symbol of the weakening of the private sector.” 



Phelps is among the world’s leading authorities on the way different economic systems enable or thwart the dynamic adjustment and entrepreneurial innovation that delivers long‐​run productivity and growth. By significantly increasing government involvement in so many sectors of the economy, Phelps worries the enacted stimulus plan could make the climate of investment more rather than less uncertain, and make growth‐​enhancing innovation less rather than more likely. Potential investors may become spooked by businesses increasingly dependent on government contracts, Phelps notes, since these firms may face additional regulations and bureaucratic requirements which may make them appear less able nimbly to adapt. Additionally, the anticipation of higher future taxes–the price of the current spending surge–could dampen consumer demand and “have a chilling effect upon the desire of entrepreneurs to innovate,” Phelps says.



The incentives of entrepreneurs is central to Phelps’ thought. Phelps says he “just doesn’t understand” the argument that government can spur innovation through top‐​down subsidies for selected new technologies. Citing his Columbia colleague Amar Bhide, Phelps suspects that “a lot of money will be made by being in the right place at the right time and knowing the right people. Especially knowing the right people.” Phelps is disturbed by the thought that we may be shifting from an entrepreneurial economy toward a lobbying economy. “A lot of potential entrepreneurs, who were contemplating making an innovation and launching it in the marketplace, will now think, ‘Well maybe the safer thing to do is to try to get that government contract.’ … And nobody does the innovation. They’re all too busy trying to get the government contract.”



Prescott and Phelps have often taken opposing sides in fundamental technical disputes within macroeconomics. But, despite the acrimony passing between some prominent economists on the blogs and op‐​ed pages, these two Nobel Prize‐​winning macroeconomists seemed to me to play a similar tune–albeit on very different analytical and rhetorical instruments. Both point to the importance of a stable framework of rules that makes the risk‐​taking and complex coordination of productive economic activity seem worthwhile. Both point to the hazards of suddenly, dramatically, and haphazardly rewriting the rules mid-game–even if the rules do need revising. 



Consider the lesson of what is perhaps Edward Prescott and Finn Kydland’s most famous and important finding. Very roughly stated, they show that even very brilliantly designed changes in policy intended to affect the expectations, and thus the behavior, of economic decision‐​makers will tend to be self‐​defeating. Why? Because if future policymakers have the motive and discretion to change the policy rule–and they almost always do–then they probably will. As consumers and investors catch on, they take the fickleness–the “time inconsistency”–of policymakers into account, which undermines the ability of a new regime to shape expectations, and economic behavior, as they may have hoped. Harvard macroeconomist Gregory Mankiw summarizes the upshot of Prescott and Kydland’s work this way: “The surprising outcome of this analysis is that policymakers can sometimes better achieve their goals by having their discretion taken away from them.” As Prescott told me: “You want to follow a good set of rules and not have discretion.” 



Massive discretionary changes in the structure of economic incentives–the kind you get with “the most sweeping economic recovery package in our history”–tend not to brighten expectations and revive animal spirits. These interventions instead tend to unsettle consumers, investors, and entrepreneurs by vividly demonstrating how political discretion can so suddenly throw everything up for grabs. “The scary thing is,” Prescott says, “when this doesn’t work what do they do? Start panicking and throwing good money after bad?” 



Who knows? And there’s the problem.

President Obama’s risky perseverance on health care is running over another of his pet government expansions—the cap‐​and‐​trade bill sent by the House on June 26 for Senate consideration. Recall that cap‐​and‐​trade is complex legislation with a very simple premise: make energy so expensive to consume that Americans use less of it, and “greenhouse gas” emissions are thereby curtailed.



But even though it’s now clear the bill is not getting out of Congress, look for the Obama Administration to saddle our economy with this huge new energy tax through other means.



First, a brief flashback: The blowback against Obamunism began over global warming, not health care. By a squeaky 219–212 vote, the House rushed the 1,300-page cap‐​and‐​trade opus out the door so the members could get back to the hustings for the Fourth of July. When many freshman Democrats got home, those who voted for it experienced the first angry town halls of their careers. In our minds, it is easy to remember that the rancorous public meetings that continued in the August recess were always about health care, but they weren’t.





The bottom line is that Senate Democrats are perfectly happy to kick cap‐​and‐​trade under the bus.



So, given that health care is now effectively bottled up in both chambers of Congress, why isn’t Obama pushing cap‐​and‐​trade in the Senate? Simple: the votes aren’t there for it. Blanche Lincoln, the new head of the Agriculture Committee, calls cap‐​and‐​trade a “complete non starter” and said that it is not her “preference to move on cap and trade this year.” Majority Leader Harry Reid recently signaled his agreement by stating that cap‐​and‐​trade “may” not be considered until next year.



For cap‐​and‐​trade, “next year” translates as “never.” Senators know what touched off the town halls, and they know what fate awaits many of their Democratic colleagues come November 2010. Passing an unpopular health care “public option” along with cap‐​and‐​trade will easily realign the Senate into its old filibustering self. That kills cap‐​and‐​trade in the next Congress.



But do not despair, fans of economy‐​killing regulation.



Thanks to the Supreme Court’s landmark decision in Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency (2007), the EPA has authority to issue its own regulations on carbon dioxide. So while asking legislators to swallow hard on the bitter gristle of cap‐​and‐​trade, the president has really had the power to enact its core components on his own all along. Small wonder lawmakers of his own party are more than willing to toss the issue back onto his plate.



Now that cap‐​and‐​trade has so spectacularly failed in the legislature, it is a sure bet that Obama will direct (or has directed) EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson to issue her own cap‐​and‐​trade protocols. Look for something concrete out of EPA before the U.N.‘s climate change confab in Copenhagen in early December. (That “something” may even include a new fuel economy standard of 35.5 miles-per-gallon—though it would be lower, of course, for the inefficient cars produced by government‐​owned General Motors.)



The timing of the Copenhagen conference is really what has been driving Obama’s support for cap‐​and‐​trade all along. It would be an embarrassment for a left‐​hewing “green” president to show up empty‐​handed at such an event—and it will greatly diminish Obama’s ability to wag his finger at other industrialized countries. For sure, the world’s largest emitter of CO2—China—isn’t going to agree to any mandatory emissions reductions unless the U.S. has something very serious in hand. And if China does nothing, there’s simply not going to be a major slowdown in the growth of atmospheric greenhouse gases.



Not that it really matters. The rather large elephants crowding cap‐​and‐​trade out of the Senate is the earth’s reluctance to warm in the last decade along with new projections saying that we could go another ten years without much warming.



The current hiatus in warming portends a reduction in potential heating for the entire century. Most computer models produce significant warming as a result of an increase in atmospheric water vapor (a “greenhouse” gas), which comes from an ocean initially warmed by carbon dioxide. When the ocean doesn’t warm much, this “feedback” effect is delayed. Or so goes the myth.



The lack of warming is an embarrassment to any elected official who has been hiding behind “the science is settled” fig leaf in order to promote cap‐​and‐​trade. While every scientist will tell you that indeed the surface temperature of the planet is warmer than it was a century ago (that’s the “settled” part of global warming science), very few scientists anticipated as long a period without warming as we are in. In other words, the real science of future warming is completely unsettled. 



The bottom line is that Senate Democrats are perfectly happy to kick cap‐​and‐​trade under the bus. They’re going to have a hard enough time recovering from the upcoming health care wreck. But the economy, meanwhile, will have an equally hard time recovering from what President Obama is going to do instead.

There’s been a renewed debate lately over whether NPR and PBS are tilted to the left. I’ve offered some examples of bias before. I noticed a couple more last week:



* NPR’s _Diane Rehm Show_ devoted an hour to Sen. Bernie Sanders, the independent socialist from Vermont, talking about his new book _The Speech_. But it looks like Diane has not interviewed Sen. Rand Paul, the constitutional conservative from Kentucky, about his new book _The Tea Party Goes to Washington_ , even though it’s selling better than Sanders’s book. It’s pretty clear to book publicists that it’s much easier to get a liberal author on the _Diane Rehm Show_ than a conservative or libertarian author.



* Meanwhile, this week PBS is featuring the latest in its program _Journey to Planet Earth_ , this episode featuring “environmental visionary Lester Brown,” the long‐​time president of the Worldwatch Institute. The episode, “Plan B: Mobilizing To Save Civilization,” “delivers a clear and unflinching message – either confront the realities of climate change or suffer the consequences of lost civilizations and failed political states.” Matt Damon hosts. But Lester Brown’s decades‐​long predictions about environmental disasters have been wrong more often than the 5.9 million NCAA brackets filled out on ESPN. See this review from 1999 or this one from 2000 or this one from 2009. Meanwhile, a PBS documentary featuring the ideas of Julian Simon, who challenged doomsday orthodoxy and notably got things right? Don’t bet on it.



* Check out the Forum Network, “a PBS and NPR public media service in collaboration with public stations and community partners across the United States [intended] to bring a diverse range of perspectives on both local and global issues to audiences around the world” through an online library of “thousands of lectures by some of the world’s foremost scholars, authors, artists, scientists, policy makers, and community leaders, available to citizens of the world for free.” If the tilt of the videos isn’t obvious, just click on any letter under Speakers and see how long it takes to encounter a conservative or libertarian speaker. Or try searching for speakers like Arthur Schlesinger and Milton Friedman, Julian Simon and Lester Brown, and see what results turn up. Or check out the 10‐​part series on same‐​sex marriage, which appears to be tilted 8 to 2 in favor. Which is OK with me, as that’s also my position, but it might not quite reflect the viewpoints of the diverse taxpayers who are paying for the service.



But one might say, so what if NPR and PBS tilt to the left? Lots of media have an ideological slant. You’re not likely to see Bernie Sanders on Fox, and Rand Paul has probably learned what kind of reception he’ll get at MSNBC.



The difference is that NPR and PBS are funded by taxpayers (not entirely, but to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars a year). The First Amendment protects freedom of speech and of the press. But no one has a right to government funding of his or her speech. And when government does speak or fund speakers, the legal rules become far more complex than when a private person speaks. Surely the taxpayers and their representatives have some say over what they will pay for, and that means that recipients of government funding are constantly looking over their shoulder to see if they’re offending their patrons in Congress.



Some people on the left have advocated that public broadcasters liberate themselves from taxpayer funding so they could become more aggressive. It’s quite possible that an NPR free of taxpayer funds and political strings would be more vigorously liberal than it is now. That’s fine. Under the First Amendment, independent media have the right to be as liberal, conservative, libertarian, socialist, national socialist, bigoted, or religious as they want. Just don’t make the taxpayers pay for it.

"**Food parcels are still being handed out to about 150 people by a charity months after the country's first lockdown.**
Bedfordshire-based Social Education Voluntary Association (SEVA) Trust UK said it had worked ""without a break"" since Covid restrictions in March.
Jenny Woods, 73, a Bedford widow who has received parcels, said you should never be ""too proud or independent"" to ask for help.
The group is supporting families, rough sleepers and international students.
Charan Sekhon, the Sharnbrook-based charity's chairman, said: ""We are not an emergency response or food support charity. In light of Covid-19 and serious impacts on our local communities and overseas students, we decided to help our communities.
""We are trying our best to operate as per seva, meaning selfless service in Punjabi and Hindi, principles given by the first Sikh guru, Guru Nanak, who started the concept of langer, meaning free food for the needy.""
He said the charity started in 2016 and is currently helping 50 families or individuals, 45 homeless people, all in Bedford, and international students across the country.
It has also helped more than 1,000 people and students in India since the pandemic started.

"The significant retreat of elements of the West Antarctic ice sheet such as the Thwaites glacier recently reported in the journal Science suggests a possible sea level rise of 3 to 3.7m. This is a huge increase in sea level that cannot fail to affect us all. With so much of the world’s population living in low-lying cities, it seems more important now than ever that we’re able to make accurate predictions of sea level change. However, to do this we need to know not only how much ice is being lost from Antarctica and other frozen regions, but how the Earth’s surface deforms in response to that loss.  The trillions of tonnes of ice locked in ice sheets weighs heavily on the bedrock underneath it. As the mass of ice grows and shrinks, over geological time the Earth is compressed by the weight, or springs back as it melts, which in turn displaces more or less of the oceans and affects the extent of sea level rise. This is tricky to calculate because the Earth deforms in two ways. There is an instantaneous elastic rebound of the crust, like a spring bouncing back after a weight has been taken off. This is followed by a very slow uplift due to movement of the mantle, the layer of semi-molten rock underlying the roughly 100 mile-thick hard outer crust.  Although we think of the mantle as rock, it flows like a highly viscous fluid when subject to changes in surface load. This typically occurs over many thousands of years, but the timescale depends on the viscosity of the mantle and how easily it can flow. As it is many miles below the surface and exists at temperatures of up to 1,000°C, we cannot directly measure its properties – so we have to infer them indirectly. Our recent study of the Northern Antarctic Peninsula published in the journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters was a sort of fast-forward version of this problem. The mantle in this region is commonly thought to be less viscous and more mobile than in other parts of Antarctica. This means that it responds much more quickly to changes in pressure as ice is unloaded at the surface. We combined records of the significant loss of ice that has taken place here in the past ten to 15 years with GPS measurements of the Earth’s rebounding motion to unravel this problem on a regional scale. Over the past few decades, several ice shelves at the very tip of the Antarctic Peninsula have collapsed, with the result that glaciers flowing into where the shelves once were now deliver more ice into the sea. Satellites record the glaciers’ elevation frequently, so scientists can determine the rate of thinning and how much ice is lost from the land into the sea. GPS transmitting stations fixed to the Antarctic bedrock record deformation of the Earth – and several sites have been installed in the Northern Antarctic Peninsula to measure the rebounding due to ice loss in this area. What we have discovered from this data is how quickly the Earth is moving 250 miles below the surface. The instantaneous elastic rebound expected from the ice loss did not tally with the GPS records, leaving an unexplained and rapid rise of up to 15mm per year. This means that the remaining rebound has to come from the flow of the mantle pushing underneath.  We used the measurements to determine that the mantle viscosity had to be around ten times lower than previously thought for this region – and consequently has responded much more quickly to the lightening load at surface level – in scales of years rather than centuries. We can almost see it happening and being able to take accurate GPS measurements is incredibly useful. It also enables us to predict the amount of rebound much closer to the thinning glaciers than our current GPS sites, and based on what we know, this could be as much as 47mm per year. This has really significant implications for the interpretation of GPS records, which are often used to verify models used in the prediction of sea-level rise and for measurements of the Earth’s gravitational field, which are used to detect ongoing changes in the mass of ice sheets. So the glacier retreat reported in West Antarctica will also be driving further, rapid bedrock uplift. This could be as much as 5cm (2 inches) per year, but the historical GPS record in this region is still too short to provide detailed answers. As Antarctic glaciers continue to thin, the unloading of ice will provide an opportunity to probe the Earth in other parts of Antarctica.  While this is fortunate for earth scientists to pursue their interests, given that sea level rise affects everyone it’s not something we really welcome."

Did you wonder about the 1 – 2 m of hail in Mexico?



Did you ponder the physics of hail piling cars at funny angles?



Did you blame the Guadalajara Council for not declaring a climate emergency?



Wonder no more:



It was clearly a dramatic and extremely impressive event with major local impacts–but I think the physical characteristics have been fundamentally mischaracterized. I have no doubt there were 1-2 meter hail drifts in some spots (photos attest to that)– **but those drifts were clearly created by flash flooding down streets and culverts in a highly urbanized area.** (A strong clue are the cars stacked on top of each other–water did that, not hail!). **Come to think of it, the physical constraints of a single storm dropping 6+ feet of actual solid ice would probably be prohibitive anywhere on Earth,** I would think. I don’t know the exact numbers, but even just considering the amount of column water or the vertical forces required to loft that much solid water…well, suffice it to say it would stretch credulity.

Share this...FacebookTwitterJust call the Jyllands-Posten’s Sunday feature the “Climate Catastrophe Caricatures”!
By P Gosselin and Arne Garbøl
Huge doubt over claims made by alarmist climate scientists is now spreading to leading Scandinavian publications, the Jyllands-Posten in Denmark for example.

Jyllands-Posten does a highly critical 4-page Sunday edition story on climate alarmism.
Denmark’s Jyllands-Posten print edition last Sunday published a major four-page headline story (see photo above), featuring leading critics of alarmist climate science: renowned IPCC scientist Lennart Bengtsson of Sweden, and others. Hat-tip Sebastian Lüning.
Though Bengtsson believes CO2 is warming the planet somewhat, he says it’s real impact has been grossly exaggerated.
Many of you will recall that the Jyllands-Posten is the daily that famously published the controversial Muhammad caricatures some years back, setting off a firestorm of protest across the Muslim world. Now the Danish daily is setting off a firestorm of protest from the climate alarmism mullahs.
“For too long random extreme weather events have been allowed to shape the climate debate,” writes the Jyllands-Posten (JP). The article tells its readers it’s time to get back to rationality and science. 

What catastrophe?, the Jyllands-Posten is asking with the above chart (Scafetta). The models so far have been completely wrong!
“Tired of media over-dramatizing climate development ”
The JP writes Bengtsson “is angry and disappointed by the spread of so many untruths and lies about the climate, and especially the future climate, and that it is totally spoiling the climate debate. […] and he is really tired of politicians, media, and climate scientists over-dramatizing the climate development and the consequences of more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.”
On the rate of warming JP cites Bengtsson: “it is a good deal lower than what IPCC has put forward…totally different from the report the World Bank presented.” This type of reporting by major dailies is not the kind of thing Danes and Europeans are accustomed to reading. Clearly climate science is being seriously challenged in Denmark.

//-->




This is not the first time that Bengtsson has been vocal on the topic of climate hyper-ventilation, see here and here. Bengtsson goes so far to say that the IPCC and World Bank reports at times sound like end-of-the-world declarations.
Look at the real data
The JP writes that Bengtsson thinks its completely wrong to use weather events as evidence of climate change, and is asking journalists and politcians “to take a closer look at what is happening in the world’s real climate.” For example: “In Uppsala we have measured temperatures since 1722. Nothing indicates that
climate here is running amok in global warming.” 
The JP then writes that scientists who do not share catastrophic climate views risk being marginalized, citing criticism by Professor Ole Humlum, and that young scientists no longer dare to speak up. “It created an outcry. It’s a little bit ironic that it now appears to be correct,” Humlum says.
In the article Bengtsson is quoted saying that the CO2’s impact is exaggerated. “Climate models showed a faster warming than what we have seen.” Both Ole Humlum and climate scientist PhD Nicola Scafetta of Duke University in North Carolina agree. JP shows a temperature chart from Scafetta comparing projected temperature to observed (see above).
Hysteria is rampant when it comes to the Arctic ice melt
Bengtsson also tells the JP that the significance of the recent Arctic ice melt has been completely blown out of proportion, “We know that there was very little ice in the Arctic in the thirties and the forties.” JP writes that Bengtsson is far from being alone with that view, citing Professor Ola Johannessen, who “agrees that the climate debate is dominated by catastrophic statements, which has nothing to do with reality.” The JP takes a lengthy look at the situation in the Arctic, and shows that nothing really unusual is happening there. It’s likely that many Danes breathed a sigh of relief after reading the Jylland-Posten piece.
Hansen’s scenarios called “nonsense”
The news about Greenland and Antarctica are also hugely over-hyped. JP quotes Bengtsson: “Worrying about Antarctica melting is like worrying about the Earth and Venus colliding within the next billion years, which some models show could happen.” This is an opinion that is also shared by Johannessen, who called James Hansen’s claims “nonsense”:
Once American scientist James Hansen said that Greenland ice would melt within some hundred years, but this is nonsense. If global warming continued, it would take thousands of years.”
No link between warming and greater sea level rise
Lennart Bengtsson also warns against sea level rise alarmism: “The fact is that we can’t see a link between the warming and the increased sea level. The global warming has until now been totally harmless.”
JP also cites leading scientists in the article, assuring that the climate on the planet just doesn’t tip. There are built-in mechanisms to prevent this. History clearly shows this.
The Jyllands-Posten piece represents another major step by important elements of the European media in taking a tougher and more critical look at climate science. Prominent climate scientists are speaking out, and the media is handing them the megaphone.

"Brightening clouds with salt crystals and deploying slicks of coral larvae to try and limit the impacts of global heating on the Great Barrier Reef are among more than 40 concepts being backed by the Australian government in an ambitious $150m research and development program. A two-year feasibility study released by the government on Thursday has reduced about 160 potential ideas to a list of 43 that will be funded for further investigation under the Reef Restoration and Adaptation Program (RRAP).  About $100m for the program comes from $443m of previously announced government funding being administered in a partnership with the not-for-profit Great Barrier Reef Foundation. A further $50m will come from a consortium of the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS), CSIRO, the University of Queensland, QUT, James Cook University, Southern Cross University and the Great Barrier Reef Foundation. The Great Barrier Reef Foundation said it wanted to raise a further $100m from the private sector, and said research and development providers had committed to matching that with a further $50m to create a potential $300m fund. The world’s biggest coral reef system is under intense pressure from global heating. The summer of 2020 saw the third and widest outbreak of mass coral bleaching in five years. Ocean heating, caused by rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, is threatening coral reefs around the globe. The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said most tropical coral reefs would disappear even if heating was limited to 1.5C and would be “at very high risk” at 1.2C. Global heating is already at about 1C since the industrial revolution. The federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, said a “global response” was needed to tackle rising greenhouse gas emissions. She said: “For the average Australian and the average citizen of the world that cares deeply about the reef, this is our chance to shine and demonstrate that while we know climate change is the number one challenge to our reef, we also know there is much we can do to prepare the reef and put it in the best possible position for it to become as resilient as it needs to be.” The feasibility study, led by AIMS, said: “Even if the world manages to stabilise global warming at 1.5C above the pre-industrial average, mass-bleaching events are predicted to increase in frequency and severity in the coming decades. Critically, the reef’s resilience may already be significantly impaired.” The study added: “In short, we are facing the very real prospect that, within a generation and without concerted action to reduce emissions and help drive adaptation and faster recovery from damage, the Great Barrier Reef as we have known it will cease to exist.” Last week, the chief scientist of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, Dr David Wachenfeld, told Guardian Australia that measures to improve the reef’s resilience were needed, but their success was underpinned by “dealing with the climate problem.” Dr Paul Hardisty, the chief executive of AIMS, said the “best and brightest scientists” from across Australia had been brought together to work on the feasibility study. “What we have found is pretty profound. There is real hope for the reef,” he said. “RRAP is all about finding ways to help protect the reef from the effects of future warming and to prevent the kinds of bleaching that we have seen going on and to help damaged reefs recover.” He said the research effort was “at the forefront of any science being done anywhere in the world”. Some methods previously discussed as having potential to lower temperatures on reefs during heat stress events – including using pumps and fans to circulate cooler deeper water onto shallower corals – have been ruled out for further research. But other concepts have been approved for further research in programs that will run over the next five to 10 years. They include: Shading reefs by brightening clouds using nano-sized ocean salt crystals, or creating fog and mist over smaller reef areas Using “micro-bubbles”, ultra-thin natural films and farmed algae to reduce light over smaller areas Stabilising and enhancing damaged reef structures with mesh, frames, concrete shapes and 3D printed forms that could recreate the complexity of natural reefs Dispersing slicks of natural and tank-raised coral larvae onto reefs Breeding corals that are naturally more heat tolerant and then using their larvae in mass dispersal David Mead, the AIMS director of strategic development, who helped coordinate the feasibility study, told Guardian Australia: “The outcome we want is to retain the fundamental resilience of the Great Barrier Reef. “This is to progress a broad range of ideas and some will get eliminated along the way.” On cloud brightening, Mead explained the concept was to spray nano-sized droplets of salt water to increase the reflective capabilities of clouds. While the effect was “subtle” he said over a period of weeks initial modelling suggested it could keep water temperatures below the threshold where corals bleached. “It sounds scary and we need to do a lot of detailed studies on any downstream impacts,” he said. The feasibility study also estimated the annual cost of the 43 different concepts being researched. While the costs seemed high – cloud brightening, for example, would cost an estimated $158m a year – Mead said the benefits were also very large. The study modelled likely benefits from deploying the interventions, which ranged from $10.7bn over 60 years to figures in the hundreds of billions. But the cost benefits from deploying the measures were dependent on future greenhouse gas emissions and diminished as temperatures went higher. Hardisty said the study had shown it was “technically feasible to act at scale” but he said “it’s going to be a combination of measures applied at different scales and in different areas that will work together to achieve real success.” He said: “If we can get the science right and intervene on the reef at scale to prevent this kind of damage and build that resilience, then the benefits for Australia environmentally, socially and economically, especially for reef communities, is going to be in the tens of billions of dollars.” Anna Marsden, managing director of the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, said the feasibility study had shown that 71% of the Australian public supported large-scale efforts to help reefs adapt."
"**GPs in Northern Ireland are planning to deliver Covid-19 vaccines for people aged over 80 who do not live in care homes from 4 January.**
Doctors have been advised to ""assume"" the GP vaccination programme will begin on that date.
Approval is anticipated for two vaccines in the coming weeks.
Separately on Saturday, the Department of Health reported nine more coronavirus-related deaths and 315 new cases of the virus in Northern Ireland.
It brings the department's overall death toll, which is based on deaths from any cause within 28 days of a positive test - to 983.
In the latest update about Northern Ireland's vaccination programme, GPs have been asked to identify all patients who are 80 or over on 1 January 2021 and do not reside in a care home to prepare for the roll-out.
A letter sent to GP practices said ""there is a need to plan for the earliest possible commencement"" of the programme.
The letter, first reported in The Irish News, was issued by the Health and Social Care Board (HSCB).
It advises that patients receiving the vaccine will require ""15 minutes of direct observation"" following the injection.
Leisure centres are among venues proposed for the delivery.
It said GPs will be central to the programme's roll-out, with Northern Ireland ""relying"" on them along with health trusts to ""urgently"" begin administering the doses once the drugs are licensed.
The initiative is a ""major undertaking"" by GP practices to ""help bring the pandemic under control"" according to the head of general medical services at the HSCB, Dr Margaret O'Brien.
""Whilst clarity is still required on a number of issues, including the date of approval and delivery of the vaccine, the exact storage requirements and priority groups, the situation is developing at pace and there is a need to plan for the earliest possible commencement of the vaccination programme,"" said Dr O'Brien.
""We do however have enough information to be able to start to plan for a Covid-19 vaccination programme.""
Vaccine developers at both Pfizer and AstraZeneca are submitting full data to regulators to apply for emergency approval so that countries can start using these different vaccines to immunise whole populations.
Patients will receive two doses of the vaccine, 28 days apart and it may not possible to administer the vaccine while recipients are in their car, the letter to GPs states.
GPs have been asked to complete their annual flu vaccination programme before the end of December so that their efforts can switch to Covid vaccinations, according to Frances O'Hagan from the British Medical Association (BMA).
Ms O'Hagan, deputy chair of the BMA's Northern Ireland GPs' committee, told BBC News NI it will be an ""absolutely mammoth"" task.
She said the vaccinations were ""new work that we would never have done before, in the middle of our busiest time of year"".
""We would have to see the patients for their first vaccine and then see them again in 21 to 28 days - it is quite a narrow window to get people all back again.
""The other problem is that we are being told there is to be a 15-minute wait for each patient after their vaccine - we still have to socially distance them.""
Ms O'Hagan said she believed the vaccination programme would have to ""go on for quite some time"".
On Friday, BBC News NI reported plans were under way to allow NI's vaccination programme to begin in December.
Health and social care frontline workers are expected to be vaccinated in the first phase, followed by residents and staff of care homes and the clinically vulnerable.
Without regulatory approval, plans for vaccine delivery are at this stage are provisional.
The vaccination programme will be on a phased basis, and will run well into 2021, according to the Department of Health.
Plans include a public information campaign to encourage take up among the public.
The JCVI (Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation) group will decide on who should be first in line to receive it, but it has been widely reported that care home residents and health and social care workers will be the first priority groups."

Matthew 7:5 – Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother’s eye.
As Greenpeace publishes yet another attack on a reputable scientist, (Dr Willie Soon), who happens to disagree with the IPCC, they again ignore the massive funding going into the “green” movement, from corporations including “big oil”, foundations and governments.
Their constant attacks on the integrity of  genuine scientists are classic diversionary tactics to avoid close examination of the millions of dollars going into the Global Warming project. A commentary by David and Amy Ridenour in the Washington Times of June 14th last year, showed the major extent of funding to environmental groups by BP, who were being attacked by those same groups over the oil spill in the Gulf.

BP was also a founding member of the U.S. Climate Action Partnership, (not the same as the Climate Action Network) contributing substantial funding to the climate-change-related lobbying efforts of the environmental groups within it, which include the Environmental Defense Fund, Natural Resources Defense Council, the Nature Conservancy and the World Resources Institute.
The new “climate friendly” BP was first promoted by BP CEO, Lord John Browne in 1997, (then Sir John Browne), now on the Climate Change Advisory Board of Deutsche Bank along with Dr Pachauri of the IPCC and Professor John Schellnhuber of the German Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.
A report in the Washington Examiner, entitled “Working for Big Green can be a very enriching experience” by Mark Tapscott, showed that the leaders of 15 top Big Green environmental groups are paid more than $300,000 in annual compensation, with a half million dollar plus figure for the top “earner”.
He mentions that Environmental Defense Fund President Frederic Krupp, receives total compensation of $496,174, including $446,072 in salary and $50,102 in other compensation.
Close behind Krupp among Big Green environmental movement executives is World Wildlife Fund- US President Carter Roberts, who was paid $486,394, including a salary of $439,327 and other compensation of $47,067.
Krupp and Roberts are particularly interesting because EDF and WWF-US both receive funding from the Grantham Foundation and both are on the joint management board of Jeremy Grantham’s climate institutes at the London School of Economics, (LSE), and Imperial College, London.
Jeremy Grantham is the chairman and co-founder of GMO, a $140 billion global investment management company based in Boston with offices in London, San Francisco, Singapore, Sydney and Zurich.
His first excursion into climate funding in the UK was “The Grantham Institute for Climate Change” set up with £12 million, (~$19million) at Imperial College, London in 2007. The chairman of the LSE Grantham Institute, Lord Stern of the infamous Stern Review, is heavily involved in carbon trading via carbon ratings agency, Idea Carbon. He joined IdeaGlobal, the parent company in 2007, as Vice Chairman. He also advises HSBC on carbon trading.
Environmental Defense boast on their website of their influence on policy in Washington and how they get around the law on lobbying caps: http://www.edf.org/article.cfm?contentID=8943
“EDF has long been a powerful voice in Washington, and when the need began to exceed the $1 million annual cap on our lobbying established by tax law, we created a sister group, the Environmental Defense Action Fund, which is free of spending limits. This has enabled us to ratchet up our legislative efforts, particularly on climate, and to advocate strong environmental laws even as the stakes increase.”
A BBC investigation in 2007 by reporter Simon Cox found that the European Commission is giving millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money to environmental campaigners to run lobbying operations in Brussels. Friends of the Earth Europe (FoE), received almost half of its funding from the EU in 2007.
Greenpeace also don’t mention the money that the EPA gives to NGO’s, for example National Resources Defense Council are currently in receipt of a grant of $1,150,123, (XA – 83379901-2) for promoting carbon trading.
The World Resources Institute (WRI) has received $3,879,014 from the EPA in the last nine years for propaganda projects and promotion of emissions trading schemes, $715,000 in the current period 2011/12. If the EPA really were interested in science, they would be funding the genuine research undertaken by people like Dr Soon, rather than policy promotion for their own agenda.
Members of the board of WRI, are Al Gore and Theodore Roosevelt IV. Mr Roosevelt is the chairman of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change. and is the former chairman of the ill-fated Lehman Brothers’ Global Council on Climate Change and a board member of the Alliance for Climate Protection, whose chairman is Al Gore. The 2008 income for Gore’s “Alliance” was over $88 million.
Greenpeace really should be very careful when they seek to muddy the waters on climate science by discrediting opposing scientists, they may well find that the water is full of dirty green linen.

and Donna LaFramboise, BP, Greenpeace & the Big Oil Jackpot , the text of which follows here:
*****************
BP, Greenpeace & the Big Oil Jackpot
In what passes for debate about climate change one of the most tiresome allegations is that skeptics are lavishly funded by big oil. As a result of this funding, so the argument goes, the public has been confused by those who’ll say anything in exchange for a paycheck.
“Follow the money” we’re told and you’ll discover that climate skeptics are irredeemably tainted. Ergo nothing they say can be trusted. Ergo their concerns, questions, and objections should be dismissed out of hand.
It’s therefore amusing that the current oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is now drawing attention to the close relationship between climate change activists and BP – aka British Petroleum, an entity for which the descriptor “big oil” was surely invented.
According to the Washington Post the green group Nature Conservancy – which encourages ordinary citizens to personally pledge to fight climate change – “has accepted nearly $10 million in cash and land contributions from BP and affiliated corporations over the years.”
Gee, didn’t Greenpeace build an entire ExxonSecrets website to expose the allegedly diabolical fact that, over a 9-year-period (1998-2006) ExxonMobil donated a grand total of $2.2 million to a conservative think tank?
$10 million versus $2 million. Who do we suppose has the cozier relationship with big oil?
But that’s just the beginning. The Washington Post also points out that Conservation International, another green group which insists climate change represents a “profound threat,” has “accepted $2 million in donations from BP over the years and partnered with the company on a number of projects.”
Funny, Greenpeace doesn’t talk about that. Nor does it mention:

that BP is funding research into “ways of tackling the world’s climate problem” at Princeton University to the tune of $2 million per year for 15 years
that BP is funding an energy research institute involving two other US universities to the tune of $500 million – the aim of which is “to develop new sources of energy and reduce the impact of energy consumption on the environment”
that ExxonMobil itself has donated $100 million to Stanford university so that researchers there can find “ways to meet growing energy needs without worsening global warming”

The only dollar amounts Greenpeace cites in its explanation of why it decided to launch ExxonSecrets is that measly $2.2 million. Versus 10 + 2 + 30 + 500 + 100. Let’s see, which all adds up to…wait for it…$642 million.
If the world is divided into two factions – one that believes climate change is a serious problem and another that thinks human influence on the climate is so minimal it’s indistinguishable from background noise – one group has pulled off a bank heist while the other has been panhandling in front of the liquor store.

In the same document in which Greenpeace talks about the ExxonMobil money it chillingly asserts that climate “deniers” aren’t entitled to free speech. Why? Because “Freedom of speech does not apply to misinformation and propaganda.”
Actually, the big thinkers on the subject have consistently taken the opposite view. John Stuart Mill was adamant that no one has the right to decide what is or is not propaganda on everyone else’s behalf. He would have looked Greenpeace in the eye and told it to stop imagining that its own judgment is infallible.
More than a hundred years later Noam Chomsky famously declared that if you don’t believe in freedom of expression for opinions you despise you don’t believe in it at all.
If Greenpeace would like to have a serious conversation about who, exactly, is spreading misinformation I’m up for that – since it’s overwhelming obvious that the big oil jackpot was awarded to those on the Greenpeace side of the debate.
The fact that climate change activists have enjoyed such a powerful funding advantage and yet insisted all the while that the exact opposite was the case is troubling. It tells us a good deal about their intellectual rigour. About their character. And about their ability to distinguish fact from fiction.
If there really is a climate crisis, if our grandchildren’s future really is imperiled, these aren’t the people to lead us out of the wilderness.
 
UPDATE (June 6): Reader Terry Kesteloot alerted me to the fact that the Greenpeace.org website is apparently infected with a “very low” risk computer virus. The links in this post to Greenpeace’s ExxonSecrets FAQ have therefore been replaced with links to a copy of the document that resides at Archive.org (scroll down once the page loads).
If your machine has virus protection, the document may be viewed directly on the Greenpeace website HERE.

"**Luxury fashion house Balenciaga is to unveil its autumn/winter 2021 collection in an original video game.**
The firm said players would navigate through a virtual realm, completing tasks and meeting characters clad in the label's new designs.
Afterworld: The Age of Tomorrow, which will launch on December 6, will be playable in web browsers.
The Covid-19 pandemic has sparked a shift in the way global fashion brands showcase their lines.
Burberry unveiled its latest collection in September via Twitch, and Gucci enlisted singer Harry Styles to help showcase its latest collection line in a seven-episode mini-series.
In April, clothing brand 100 Thieves made its entire streetwear collection available in Nintendo Switch game Animal Crossing: New Horizons.
And last month Balenciaga launched its summer 2021 collection on YouTube.
Amazon has moved to attract luxury fashion shoppers to its marketplace following the shift in consumer habits this year, although a survey of 2,000 UK shoppers earlier this month found that only 32% would be interested in buying fashion via its Luxury Stores online outlet, according to website Just Style.
Marketing manager Anthony Blakemore said that online fatigue due to the pandemic had forced brands to develop new ways to excite consumers.
""Weâre seeing brands roll out innovative ways of showcasing and selling their products across the digital landscape,"" he told the BBC.
""The gamification of Balenciagaâs new collection is an excellent example of how innovative digital marketing methods can be used to not only sell clothes, but create an immersive and enjoyable digital experience.""
Michael Branney, managing director at clothing retailer Oh Polly, warned that brands should be prepared to maintain this new level of innovation.
""Once the Covid-19 pandemic is over, customers are still going to expect the same level of interaction from the brands they have spent their 2020 with,"" he told the BBC.
""Customers are now engaging in longer pieces of content, like a YouTube video, rather than a quick snapshot on Instagram. Perhaps a video game, or interactive content, is the next logical step for brands."""

The United States trade policy is adrift, seemingly guided by the protectionist winds of an insular Congress, and an administration that seems more focused on enhancing unilateral enforcement mechanisms than affirming a strong commitment to free trade. In a recent speech, US Trade Representative Ron Kirk signalled the administration’s desire to enhance domestic legislative tools for use in trade disputes, and plans for asking trading partners to “commit to actions that level the playing field”. As a result, America’s closest trading partners are worried and angry; our exporters are anxious; and, just two months into the Obama administration, 60 years of US leadership on free trade is in jeopardy.



Since the 1940s, the US has led the charge to remove international barriers to goods, services and investment. The result: a global trade explosion that has enriched American families, spurred innovation, enhanced our security and helped millions escape poverty. Every US president since Herbert Hoover has championed free trade because of its proven benefits.



Since his inauguration, US President Barack Obama has expressed a desire to follow in his predecessors’ footsteps. Meeting his Canadian and Mexican counterparts, Mr Obama backed away from his “overheated campaign rhetoric” on the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). His nominees for commerce secretary and US trade representative have been vocal trade advocates, and he has often celebrated open markets and vowed to resist “escalating protectionism”.



Unfortunately, Mr Obama’s inaction has undermined this pro‐​trade rhetoric. Mr Kirk’s confirmation took a lackadaisical two months, forcing US officials to cancel World Trade Organisation and bilateral trade negotiations. Meanwhile, new Energy Secretary Steven Chu carelessly suggested using tariffs to protect US manufacturers from countries that haven’t addressed carbon emissions — only a day after China’s top climate change official warned such carbon tariffs could start a trade war. This has all the makings of a captainless ship.



Mr Obama has not countered the protectionist impulses of his Democratic colleagues in Congress. Without White House leadership, Congress has injected anti‐​trade features into the year’s two spending bills: the “stimulus” and the 2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act.



Several reports have spotlighted the international angst over the stimulus bill’s “Buy American” provision and the US$2.4 billion in retaliatory tariffs that Mexico applies to US exports because of the omnibus bill’s ban on Mexican trucks (in direct violation of Nafta). But less reported are the bills’ other protectionist gimmicks: the stimulus allows US lumber producers to ignore the federal courts and keep US$92 million in illegally collected Canadian and Mexican lumber duties; the omnibus hits imports of both Chinese chicken and Vietnamese and Chinese textiles, and it enables mandatory country labelling for all imported food. 



These measures have been rebuked by many of America’s closest trade partners, and Mr Obama has been lectured on protectionism from, among others, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, European Union Trade Commissioner Catherine Ashton, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio “Lula” da Silva, and Chinese Commerce Minister Chen Deming. The message: on trade, America is an also‐​ran.



Because of today’s rules‐​based multilateral trading system and the interdependence of global markets, US fecklessness on trade shouldn’t lead to devastating protectionism akin to the Smoot‐​Hawley‐​induced tariff wars of the 1930s. But it’s still a problem. In 2008, global trade contracted for the first time since 1982, and protectionist pressures abound. The WTO’s Doha Round is comatose, even though an ambitious deal could inject US$2 trillion into the reeling global economy. Considering the US has steered every major trade initiative in modern history, any chance for significant progress on trade will disappear without strong American leadership — in word and deed.



Despite these problems, all is not lost. Mr Obama, although clumsily, has limited the damage from “Buy American” and pledged to reinstate the Mexican trucking programme, and the other missteps are similarly containable. But if he wants to restore US leadership on trade, Mr Obama must move quickly from defence to offence. He should immediately reaffirm America’s unwavering commitment to expanding global trade, not just “resisting protectionism”. He should also tell Democratic leaders in Congress that he will not allow protectionist nitpicking to define his trade agenda.



Finally, the president should announce his intent to treat anti‐​trade provisions in future bills like all other kinds of earmarks — make them public, transparent and extremely limited.



These steps will calm the current anxiety over America’s wavering trade policy. They will also give the president the breathing room necessary to craft a long‐​term trade strategy — one that rehabilitates a domestic free‐​trade consensus and forges a proactive, politically feasible trade policy that will guarantee America’s leadership in the global economy for the next decade.

"Dear Vice-President Joe Biden, We write to you as leaders from a diverse array of organizations building political power for young people in the United States. We are all deeply committed to ending a presidency that has set the clock back on all of the issues that impact our lives.  While you are now the presumptive Democratic nominee, it is clear that you were unable to win the votes of the vast majority of voters under 45 years old during the primary. With young people poised to play a critical role deciding the next president, you need to have more young people enthusiastically supporting and campaigning with you to defeat Donald Trump. This division must be reconciled so we can unite the party to defeat Trump. Messaging around a “return to normalcy” does not and has not earned the support and trust of voters from our generation. For so many young people, going back to the way things were “before Trump” isn’t a motivating enough reason to cast a ballot in November. And now, the coronavirus pandemic has exposed not only the failure of Trump, but how decades of policymaking has failed to create a robust social safety net for the vast majority of Americans. The views of younger Americans are the result of a series of crises that took hold when we came of political age, and flow from bad decisions made by those in power from both major parties. For millions of young people, our path to a safe and secure middle-class life is far more out-of-reach than it was for our parents or grandparents. We grew up in a world where “doing better than the generation before us” was not a foregone conclusion. Instead, we grew up with endless war, skyrocketing inequality, crushing student loan debt, mass deportations, police murders of black Americans and mass incarceration, schools which have become killing fields, and knowing that the political leaders of today are choking the planet we will live on long after they are gone. We’ve spent our whole lives witnessing our political leaders prioritize the voices of wealthy lobbyists and big corporations over our needs. From this hardship, we’ve powered a resurgence of social movements demanding fundamental change. Why would we want a return to normalcy? We need a vision for the future, not a return to the past. New leadership in November is an imperative for everything our movements are fighting for. But in order to win up and down the ballot in November, the Democratic party needs the energy and enthusiasm of our generation. The victorious “Obama coalition” included millions of energized young people fighting for change. But the Democratic party’s last presidential nominee failed to mobilize our enthusiasm where it mattered. We can’t afford to see those mistakes repeated. Young people are issues-first voters. Fewer identify with a political party than any other generation. Exclusively anti-Trump messaging won’t be enough to lead any candidate to victory. We need you to champion the bold ideas that have galvanized our generation and given us hope in the political process. As the party’s nominee, the following commitments are needed to earn the support of our generation and unite the party for a general election against Donald Trump: Climate change: Adopt the frameworks of the Green New Deal and make specific commitments around achieving a just transition to 100% clean energy by 2030 for electricity, buildings and transportation; restart the economy by committing to mobilizing $10tn in green stimulus and infrastructure investments over 10 years that will create tens of millions of good jobs of the future; and commit to take on and prosecute the fossil fuel executives and lobbyists who have criminally jeopardized our generation. Gun violence prevention: Take an intersectional, comprehensive approach to preventing gun violence with the goal of reducing gun deaths by 50% in 10 years. In addition to the policies laid out in your plan, you should also include the following from the Peace Plan for a Safer America: call for a federal licensing program; hold the gun industry accountable by directing the IRS to probe the NRA’s not-for-profit status. Expand federal funding and resources for community-based violence intervention programs. Adopt Julián Castro’s People First Policing Plan and acknowledge that police brutality is gun violence. Immigration: Commit to immediate executive actions to expand Daca and other policies to protect people from deportation and hold Ice and CBP accountable. Executive actions must also close the vast and cruel web of detention camps and not replace it with a practice of tagging people with electronic monitors or surveillance sold by big-money corporations. Commit to ending the collaboration between local police and Ice and the use of racial profiling by deportation agents and local police that pulls people into the deportation pipeline. Commit to providing guaranteed access to counsel for all while making immigration courts independent and free of political manipulation. Commit to repealing the 1996 immigration reform laws and creating citizenship pathways for all undocumented people without harmful provisions. Amid the current Covid-19 pandemic, it is clear that all people, including undocumented immigrants, must be included in any healthcare reform as viruses do not discriminate on the basis of immigration status. Healthcare: Support the Affordable Drug Manufacturing Act to allow the government to manufacture generic versions of drugs and dramatically lower prescription drug prices. Support Medicare for All, especially in light of the coronavirus pandemic. Champion the repeal of the Hyde amendment and people’s ability to access abortion care regardless of their income or zip code. Criminalization: Champion comprehensive reform of our criminal legal system. Incentivize states to cut their incarcerated population by 50% while supporting massive investment in housing, drug treatment, diversion, education and health programs. End the war on drugs and support the equitable legalization of marijuana based on proposals laid out by Senator Booker, Senator Warren, Senator Sanders, Secretary Castro and others. Education: Support free undergraduate tuition for public colleges, universities and vocational schools for all students, regardless of income, citizenship status or criminal record. Provide economic relief to 45 million Americans and stimulate the economy by addressing the student debt crisis and canceling the entire $1.7tn in student loan debt. Wealth tax: Support an annual tax on the extreme wealth of the wealthiest 180,000 households in America who are in the top 0.1% based on proposals laid out by Senator Sanders, Senator Warren and Tom Steyer. Foreign policy: Commit to seek congressional approval on any authorization of war and support repeal of 2001 and 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force. Democracy: Support the elimination of the filibuster and the expanding of the supreme court. Call for the adoption of strong anti-corruption reforms laid out by Senator Warren and Senator Sanders. Champion a voting system that works for all Americans. Every citizen should be automatically registered to vote, get to cast their ballot in a secure, accessible way that fits their needs, and never have their right to vote taken away for any reason. Get big money out of politics and make the passage of HR 1 a top priority. Commit to appointing progressive elected officials who endorsed Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren as transition co-chairs, such as representatives Ro Khanna, Pramila Jayapal, Ayanna Pressley or Katie Porter. Pledge to appoint zero current or former Wall Street executives or corporate lobbyists, or people affiliated with the fossil fuel, health insurance or private prison corporations, to your transition team, adviser roles or cabinet. Appoint a trusted progressive to lead the White House presidential personnel office to ensure that the entire administration is free of corruption and staffed with public servants committed to advancing a progressive agenda. Commit to put trusted voices on issues of importance to our generation on your campaign and transition team’s policy working groups, such as Governor Inslee’s policy team on climate; Senator Warren’s policy team on financial regulation; Aramis Ayala, Bryan Stevenson and Larry Krasner on criminal justice; Bonnie Castillo of National Nurses United and Dr Abdul El-Sayed on healthcare; and Mary-Kay Henry, Sara Nelson and Senator Sanders’ policy team on jobs and the economy. Commit to appointing advisers, such as Joseph Stiglitz, to your national economic council and office of management and budget who believe in the principles of the Green New Deal and a rapid transition to a 100% clean and renewable energy economy. Appoint a national director of gun violence prevention in the White House who will oversee the policy platform, coordinate across agencies and incorporate a survivor-centered approach. Commit to appointing an attorney general who will re-examine the Heller decision. Appoint a DHS secretary committed to holding Ice and CBP agents accountable and dismantling Ice and CBP as we know them. Create a White House commission to represent the voices and needs of immigrants who can work together to ensure that executive actions and legislative solutions address the needs of immigrant communities. Create a taskforce on young Americans at the White House focused on the many issues unique to the next generation’s health, wellbeing and economic stability. The leadership of the office should directly report to the president and work regularly with the domestic policy council, national economic council and office of public engagement. Taskforce representatives from each agency should be appointed by and report to respective secretaries and taskforce leadership and focus on policy and administrative action that directly affects every aspect of young people’s lives. This office should engage directly with young people across the country and ensure representation from youth movement leaders in its ranks. In addition to these policy and personnel commitments, you and your campaign must demonstrate a real passion and enthusiasm for engaging with our generation and its leaders. It’s not just about the policies and issues, but also about how you prioritize them, how you talk about them and how you demonstrate real passion for addressing them. You must demonstrate, authentically, that you empathize with our generation’s struggles. Calling for solutions that match the scale, scope and urgency of the problems we are facing is not radical. If nothing else, this moment of crisis should show that it is the pragmatic thing to do. We want results and we’re leading some of the movements that will help deliver them. The organizations below will spend more than $100m communicating with more than 10 million young members, supporters and potential voters this election cycle. We are uniquely suited to help mobilize our communities, but we need help ensuring our efforts will be backed up by a campaign that speaks to our generation. Our generation is the future of this country. If you aim to motivate, mobilize and welcome us in, we will work tirelessly to align this nation with its highest ideals.Signed, Alliance for Youth Action IfNotNow Movement Justice Democrats March for Our Lives Action Fund NextGen America Student Action Sunrise Movement United We Dream Action"

Share this...FacebookTwitterLast week German meteorologist Dominik Jung openly wondered what had happened to all the warming, pointing out that Germany was suffering from its fifth consecutive colder than normal winter – a record!
Earlier this month renowned meteorologist Prof. Dr. Horst Marlberg announced that global warming was finished, and that cooling was ahead for the next decades.
Last month German meteorologist Dr. Karsten Brandt (photo above) dismissed (again) global warming catastrophism.
And just days ago, yet another German meteorology site questioned global warming in a piece titled: “Global Warming Stagnates – Guessing The Causes“. The report begins:
Since 1998 the global mean temperature has not risen significantly. While the global temperature rose by about 0.5°C from the 1970s until the end of the 1990s, it has stagnated for the last 15 years, though at a high level. […] The stagnation surprised a lot of experts, who are now searching for possible causes for this development.”
Wetteronline.de then explains the various theories, writing that the stagnation may be due to weakened solar activity, or because of huge emissions of aerosols over Asia – global dimming – or perhaps because of ocean currents.

google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";
google_ad_width = 200;
google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




Wetteronline.de ends its report with:
The climate system of the Earth is very complex. There are still many interrelationships, factors, and feedbacks affecting the climate that are not known or still not adequately researched. Thus a combination of the above factors is possible for explaining the stagnation in worldwide temperature. But also a completely unknown phenomenon that climate science knows nothing about is possible. Even a natural variation of the climate cannot be excluded.”
The author of this report is getting warmer, and warmer. He’s on the right path, and really only needs to pick up a copy of Fritz Vahrenholt’s and Sebastian Lüning’s “Die kalte Sonne“. The book lays it all out on what’s behind climate change. Read it, and decide for yourself. It’s great reading, especially for meteorologists.
One thing is sure: the science of climate change is no longer an open and shut case – not by any means. The consensus that humans are driving the climate is more shattered than ever in Germany, and is crumbling at an increasing velocity.
If Professor Schellnhuber and his PIK wish to implement their “Great Transformation” of global society, they’d better hurry up!

"**The R number has fallen below one for the first time since mid-August, which means the epidemic is thought to be no longer growing.**
The latest R estimate for the whole of the UK, from the government's scientific advisory group Sage, to between 0.9 and 1.
The R number is a way of rating coronavirus or any disease's ability to spread.
R is the number of people that one infected person will pass on a virus to, on average.
Measles has an R number of 15 in populations without immunity.
That means, on average, one person will spread measles to 15 others.
Coronavirus - known officially as Sars-CoV-2 - would have a reproduction number of about 3 if no action was taken to stop it spreading.
You can't capture the moment people are infected. Instead, scientists work backwards.
Data - such as the number of people dying, admitted to hospital or testing positive for the virus over time - is used to estimate how easily the virus is spreading.
If the R value is higher than one, then the number of cases increases exponentially - it snowballs like debt on an unpaid credit card.
But if the R number is lower the disease will eventually stop spreading, because not enough new people are being infected to sustain the outbreak.
Governments everywhere want to force the R number down from about three (the R number if we took no action) to below one.
The R number is not fixed. Instead, it changes as our behaviour changes or as immunity develops.
Mathematical modellers at Imperial College London attempted to track how the number changed as isolation, social distancing and the full lockdown were introduced in the spring.
Before any measures came in, the R number was well above one and the conditions were ripe for a large outbreak. Successive restrictions brought it down, but it was not until full lockdown that it was driven below one.
**Scotland's** estimated R number is between 0.8 and 1.
In **Wales** the number is thought to be between 0.8 and 1 \- while in **Northern Ireland** it is about 1.
In **England** , the highest estimated R rate is in the South East, where it is between 1 and 1.2.
The UK government said in the past that the R number was one of the most important factors in making policy decisions.
It then said estimates were less reliable and less useful because the number of cases was relatively low.
But when cases started to rise again, more attention was once again paid to local and national R rates.
The aim will be to keep the R number below one.
The **R number** is one of the big three.
Another is **severity** \- some people have a very mild disease that does not cause many problems. But coronavirus and the disease it causes, Covid-19, can be severe and deadly.
The last is the **number of cases** , which is important for deciding when to act. If you have a high number, but ease restrictions so the reproduction number is about one, then you will continue to have a high number of cases.
Having a vaccine is another way to bring down the reproduction number.
A coronavirus patient would naturally infect three others on average, but if a vaccine could protect two of them from infection, then the reproduction number would fall from three to one.

You’ve probably heard the forecasts already, watch it advance on radar below:

Animate this image: >>> 
Look at all of the warnings below, the red area from Oklahoma to Lake Michigan is Blizzard Warning while the pink is Winter Storm Warning: 

click map for the latest warnings
The synoptic map shows freezing rain ahead of the system, followed by heavy snow. It’s the worst sort of situation.

The NAM snow depth model output for the next 48 hours shows a wide swath of 12-24″ of snow accumulation from near Dallas to Chicago with even more near NYC and BOS.
The plan: stock up and stay home, and make sure you have a backup plan for heat if the power goes out.

"**Thousands of learners are without qualifications after being unable to get enough work experience because of Covid, a charity says.**
Colleges Wales said some students taking vocational courses, such as BTECs, are facing delays in qualifying.
It also said it is unfair for other vocational students to sit exams next year, despite A-Level and GSCE exams being cancelled for 2021.
The Welsh Government said it has made Â£5m available to support learners.
Figures suggest there are around twice as many 16 to 18-year-olds enrolled at further education colleges than secondary schools in Wales.
Lucy Tingle, 18, was due to have finished her childcare course at Pembrokeshire College in October, but is now looking at a delay of around six months before she can qualify - after only recently resuming her work placement.
""Because our time has been shortened by lockdown and the pandemic it has put a lot of stress on us,"" she said.
""The college has managed to speak to the exam board and get the mandatory work experience hours down for us, which is a big help, but it's still not by as much as we'd hoped.""
The curriculum manager for health and childcare at Pembrokeshire College, Lesley Fudge, said the delays had been ""hugely challenging"" for students.
Ms Fudge said businesses had been unable to offer work placements since February but she has prioritised those still hoping to make it to university next year.
""Finishing their qualification will be a challenge and it will be delayed,"" she said.
""They're not likely to finish until around April or May next year.""
GCSE, AS and A-level exams in summer 2021 have been cancelled with pupil's grades set to be based on classroom assessments.
However Colleges Wales said some learners taking vocational courses this year were still likely to have ""examined content.""
Iestyn Davies said: ""Clearly we want to ensure that learners have the same experience and support as their equivalents who are doing A-levels and GCSEs.
""It's not fair to expect a small group of learners to do exams against the backdrop of disruption they've experienced.""
Jake Maloney, who teaches NVQ fabrication and welding at Coleg Gwent in Newport, said he believed his students would still have to sit several written exams in the coming months.
""We haven't heard anything from awarding bodies other than things will run as normal. I think it needs to be discussed,"" he said.
""It's easier with academic studies because you can use things like coursework [but] everyone is in the same place in not knowing what the answers are with vocational courses.""
The Welsh Government said it recognised the pandemic had caused ""significant disruption"" for students taking qualifications that require work placements.
A spokesperson said: ""We have asked Qualifications Wales to work with other regulators to ensure the approach to the 2021 examinations puts the interests of learners first.
""We are working with our colleges and have made up to Â£5m available to support those learners this year."""
"For many years the recycling collected from households in the UK and other Western countries has been exported. This strategy has enabled these countries to carry on without much thought about how consumers purchase goods and dispose of all the unwanted packaging and containers. As long as there are regular collections for recycling paper, metals and plastics, little consideration is given to where this waste goes and what happens to it. But this now has to change.   Several years ago, China woke up to the environmental consequences of having the world’s recycling dumped on it to sort, process and use in manufacturing new goods. Tougher Chinese regulations came into place in 2018, aimed at improving the quality of the recycling it imported. This should have been a wake up call to the Western world to change the way that recycling was collected and processed in order to improve the quality. But nothing changed, apart from the destination of the low-quality recycling – instead of exporting to China, the recycling was exported to several Eastern European countries and an assortment of other Asian countries, including Malaysia and the Philippines.  A dispute lasting several years over low-quality recycling that was exported by Canada to the Philippines recently saw the waste repatriated, and other countries are also set to follow this example. This solves nothing, though – this recycling has to go somewhere. We need to change the way we collect recycling to ensure that the collected items are suitable for use by manufacturers. This means changing the focus towards collecting clean, high-quality recyclable materials, segregated by type.  Contamination losses – which occur when non-recyclable or non-targeted) materials are included in collection boxes, bags or bins and are then rejected at sorting facilities and now by overseas markets – show that keeping the end point for these materials in mind is essential. There is often confusion over what can be recycled at home and this often varies between local authorities because they use different sorting facilities. A huge number of materials are recyclable, but the infrastructure does not exist in all parts of the UK, and sorting methods vary between these sorting facilities and this dictates which materials can be handled.  Collection systems need to be tailored towards the requirements of the reprocessors rather than the householder, collector or sorting facility – and this should guide householders on how and what to actually collect for recycling. Efficient sorting ensures higher quality materials are collected and reaps benefits across the recycling chain. The Welsh Government Collection Blueprint, which works on this principle, secures higher quality recyclable materials with high levels of householder participation. With improved segregation of materials, clean recycling is able to enter the market for secondary materials either closer to home, or in China where it will pass tougher import requirements. Communicating better should be a priority. Below are three ways that consumers could be helped to recycle better. Clear and consistent labelling of recyclable packaging. The removal of unhelpful “check locally” labels, which only lead to confusion and incorrect disposal of some items, is a good starting point, along with better communication of local anomalies to recycling collections. More information for householders on where recycling goes and what it is used for would improve understanding around the demand for high quality materials. The condition of recycling has an impact on its final use. If recycling is wet or greasy this often leads to contamination losses with items sticking together during mechanical sorting processes or just being so badly damaged they aren’t suitable for use.  Better reporting of the end destination of recyclable materials by councils. Publishing this information is currently voluntary. This should be made mandatory and include all waste collected, not just that handled by local authorities. This would ensure consistent, ethical and legal exports. This would expose poor export practices involving low grade and poorly sorted recyclables, which helps to hide illegal exports of post-consumer electronic items which have been hidden by the lack of transparency. Deposit and return systems for drinks containers are being investigated by the UK government, but will soon be implemented in Scotland, where environmental issues are devolved. These systems, which operate in Norway and Germany, add a deposit to the price of drinks containers which consumers redeem when they return the empty drinks containers and can use against future purchases. These systems collect higher quality, and there are other potential benefits, such as reducing litter, but there are also arguments against. These include the cost of implementation and the impact on existing local authority household collection schemes where the value of materials collected subsidises the cost of collecting it. But a loss of income for councils may be balanced out by a reduction in collection costs as the volume of recycling goes down.  Improving the quality of the material that is collected must be addressed, and deposit and return systems are seen as a necessary step towards doing this. Ultimately, we need a fundamental shift in the way we look at the waste we produce, which goes well beyond collecting vast quantities of it for faux recycling on the other side of the world."
"**The R number for coronavirus has fallen to between 0.9 and 1 for the first time since mid-August, which means the epidemic is thought to be no longer growing.**
'R' is calculated by the government's scientific advisers, and represents how many extra people each infected person passes the virus onto.
The aim is to keep R below 1 until a vaccine is rolled out.
During the first peak in the spring, R was thought to be around 3.
The latest estimate of the growth rate of the virus has also fallen, to between -2% and 0%, which indicates that the number of new infections each day is coming down.
On Friday in the UK, 521 deaths were reported within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test. There were also 16,022 new cases reported - a 25% fall on the previous week.
However cases in some regions of England are still high, particularly the North West, the North East and Yorkshire and the Humber. When lockdown ends on 2 December, most of England will move into the two toughest tiers of restrictions.
An R or reproduction number of 1 means that, on average, every person with the virus will infect one other person.
So an R number between 0.9 and 1.0 means that on average every 10 people infected will infect between 9 and 10 other people, indicating it is shrinking.
With the four nations of the UK following different policies on restrictions, the government says the estimate for R for the whole of the UK has become ""less meaningful in recent weeks"".
It says the impact of the second lockdown in England, which began on 5 November, cannot be fully evaluated yet, and adds that R ""may be below 1 for all regions already"" in England.
R is estimated using a range of data, including testing numbers, hospital admissions, intensive care deaths and estimates of how many people are infected in households across the country.
Scientists from different universities then use this data to estimate the spread of infections.
There is always a slight time lag in the R number of a matter of weeks - the latest estimate is based on data up to 24 November.
The UK government has said in the past that the R number was one of the most important factors in making policy decisions.
From Wednesday in England, more than 32 million people are due to be living under tier two restrictions, banning indoor meetings between households.
A further 23 million people will be placed under the highest - tier three - restrictions, which further limit contact between people outdoors.
Boris Johnson has defended the approach, arguing the country needs ""simplicity and clarity"" and the restrictions would ""drive"" Covid down until a vaccine is available.
Prof Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology, from the University of Edinburgh, said the R numbers across the UK ""may decrease further as the full impact of lockdown becomes apparent"".
""It is worth noting that the falls in R began in the second half of September which may indicate that measures taken during that month did have some impact in some regions of the UK,"" he said.
However he added that the data raised the question ""of whether the earlier implementation of measures short of full lockdown would have been sufficient to keep the epidemic in check and prevent local NHS Trusts from being overwhelmed."""

Guest Post by Willis Eschenbach
On an average day you’ll find lots of people, including NASA folks like Gavin Schmidt and James Hansen, evaluating how well the climate models compare to reality. As I showed here, models often don’t do well when matched up with real-world observations. However, they are still held up as being accurate by the IPCC, which uses climate models throughout their report despite their lack of rigorous testing.
XKCD, of course.
But if you ask me, that evaluation of the models by comparing them with reality is not possible. I think that the current uncertainties in the total solar irradiation (TSI) and aerosol forcings are so large that it is useless to compare climate model results with observed global temperature changes.
Why do I make the unsubstantiated claim that the current uncertainties in TSI and aerosols are that large? And even if they are that large, why do I make the even more outlandish claim, that the size of the uncertainties precludes model testing by comparison with global temperature observations?

Well … actually, I’m not the one who made that claim. It was the boffins at NASA, in particular the good folks at GISS, including James Hansen et al., who said so (emphasis mine) …
Total solar irradiance (TSl) is the dominant driver of global climate, whereas both natural and anthropogenic aerosols are climatically important constituents of the atmosphere also affecting global temperature. Although the climate effects of solar variability and aerosols are believed to be nearly comparable to those of the greenhouse gases (GHGs; such as carbon dioxide and methane), they remain poorly quantified and may represent the largest uncertainty regarding climate change. …
The analysis by Hansen et al. (2005), as well as other recent studies (see, e.g., the reviews by Ramaswamy et al. 2001; Kopp et al. 2()05b; Lean et al. 2005; Loeb and Manalo-Smith 2005; Lohmann and Feichter 2005; Pilewskie et al. 2005; Bates et al. 2006; Penner et al. 2006), indicates that the current uncertainties in the TSI and aerosol forcings are so large that they preclude meaningful climate model evaluation by comparison with observed global temperature change. These uncertainties must be reduced significantly for uncertainty in climate sensitivity to be adequately constrained (Schwartz 2004).
“Preclude meaningful climate model evaluation” … hmmm. Of course, they don’t make that admission all the time. They only say things like that when they want to get money for a new satellite. The rest of the time, they claim that their models are accurate to the nearest 0.15°C …
Now, the satellite that the NASA GISS folks (very reasonably) wanted to get money for, the very satellite that the aforementioned study was written to promote, was the Glory Mission … which was one of NASA’s more unfortunate failures.
NASA’s Glory Satellite Fails To Reach Orbit
WASHINGTON — NASA’s Glory mission launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California Friday at 5:09:45 a.m. EST failed to reach orbit.
Telemetry indicated the fairing, the protective shell atop the Taurus XL rocket, did not separate as expected about three minutes after launch.
So … does this mean that the evaluation of models by comparison with observed global temperature change is precluded until we get another Glory satellite?
Just askin’ … but it does make it clear that at this point the models are not suitable for use as the basis for billion dollar decisions.

 **Dec. 17 (Bloomberg)** — World leaders flying into Copenhagen today to discuss a solution to global warming will first face freezing weather as a blizzard dumped 10 centimeters (4 inches) of snow on the Danish capital overnight.   
  
  
**Copenhagen (CNN)** –- In a strange twist, a Washington snowstorm is forcing Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D‐​California, to make an early departure from a global warming summit here in Denmark.   
  
  
Pelosi told CNN that military officials leading her Congressional delegation have urged the 21 lawmakers to leave Copenhagen several hours earlier than scheduled on Saturday.   
  
  
The Speaker said she has agreed to the new travel plan so that lawmakers can get back to Washington before much of the expected storm wallops the nation’s capital.   
  
  
**_Washington Post_**: Before long, we will be buried by several times that amount making this a record breaking December storm. Double digit accumulations have already been reported to our south in central Virginia. This is a dangerous, severe storm with the worst still to come.   
  
  
…   
  
  
True enough, as President Obama’s courtiers at Media Matters remind us, one day’s weather doesn’t change the climate. Indeed, they quote Pat Michaels making that point last year in the _New York Times_ : 



Patrick J. Michaels, a climatologist and commentator with the libertarian Cato Institute in Washington, has long chided environmentalists and the media for overstating connections between extreme weather and human‐​caused warming. (He is on the program at the skeptics’ conference.)   
  
  
But Dr. Michaels said that those now trumpeting global cooling should beware of doing the same thing, saying that the ”predictable distortion” of extreme weather ”goes in both directions.”



Still, I think we know that if it were unseasonably warm this week, there’d be people pointing that out on television from Copenhagen.

"**Nadhim Zahawi has been appointed as a new health minister to oversee rollout of the Covid vaccine in England.**
The rollout is expected to begin before Christmas, subject to regulatory approval.
Mr Zahawi, MP for Stratford-on-Avon, will oversee distribution of the vaccine until at least next summer.
Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he was ""delighted"", adding in a tweet there was ""an enormous task ahead"".
Under the interim arrangement, Mr Zahawi will serve as a joint minister between the health department and the business department, where he currently works.
His primary focus will be on delivering the vaccine, with most areas of his business portfolio put aside.
It comes as a further 479 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported in the UK, bringing the total to 58,030. There were also a further 15,871 positive cases registered in the past 24 hours.
In a tweet, Mr Zahawi welcomed his new post but said the rollout would be a ""big responsibility and a big operational challenge"".
He added that he was ""absolutely committed to making sure we can roll out vaccines quickly - saving lives and livelihoods and helping us #buildbackbetter"".
Mr Zahawi will look after deployment of the vaccine in England only, but will work with the devolved administrations on their chosen approach. Administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will be responsible for the vaccine's distribution in their relevant nations.
Currently, the UK government has placed orders for 100 million doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, 40 million doses of the vaccine from Pfizer and BioNTech and five million doses from US firm Moderna.
Rolling out the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine may pose the greatest challenge as it needs to be stored at minus 70C, raising potential difficulties with transport and storage.
Last week, the government asked the regulator to assess the Oxford/AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine, marking ""a significant first step"" in getting the vaccine ""approved for deployment"".
It follows a similar referral to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) earlier this month to assess the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, which has been shown to stop more than 90% of people developing Covid-19 symptoms in preliminary trials.
On Saturday, the Financial Times reported that regulatory approval for that vaccine could come as early as next week - and suggested rollout would start within hours of authorisation.
Interim data from the trials of the Oxford jab showed an overall efficacy of 70%. The findings from one group of volunteers showed 62% efficacy while another group, who were given a different dose by accident, showed 90% efficacy.
The Department of Health and Social Care said the UK would be one of the first countries in the world to receive the vaccine, if it is authorised, with AstraZeneca set to have as many as four million doses ready for the UK by the end of the year and 40 million by the end of March 2021.
**By Ellie Price, political reporter, BBC News**
In ministerial terms, it's a sideways move.
But Nadhim Zahawi's new job comes with huge public expectation, and therefore the potential for political disaster.
The government is only too aware of the bloody nose it has received as a result of the shortcomings of NHS Test and Trace programme and the procurement of PPE at the start of the pandemic.
Government scientists have said, if proven to be safe and effective, mass vaccinations will offer a ""much better horizon"" by the spring.
Hospitals and other NHS trusts in England say they have been told to get ready to administer jabs from the middle of December. The winter flu vaccine programme will offer some framework for how that will work in practice.
Mr Zahawi is seen as a good media performer. He has a business background and helped to set up the polling group YouGov. He'll understand only too well the delicate art of keeping public opinion on side.
Mr Zahawi's appointment follows calls from Labour for the government to appoint a vaccine minister, who would provide accountability and avoid repeating mistakes made over PPE procurement and NHS Test and Trace.
Shadow health secretary John Ashworth said: ""Only days ago Labour called for a vaccines minister to oversee the huge logistical challenge of widespread vaccination.
""We now need a mass public health campaign urging uptake of the vaccine, alongside ensuring the resources are in place for GPs and other health professionals to rapidly roll this out as soon as possible.""
In addition to the vaccine rollout, the prime minister has said mass community testing, as seen in Liverpool, will be offered to all areas in tier three after lockdown ends on 2 December.
Earlier this week, Mr Zahawi tweeted that he was ""extremely disappointed and sad"" that Warwickshire, the county in which his constituency lies, would be placed in the most restricted tier - tier three - after England's national lockdown ends next week.
He said he would be pushing for the county of Warwickshire to be considered separately from Coventry and Solihull in all future decisions about restrictions and for the rollout of mass testing - but urged residents ""to continue following the rules to the letter"" in the meantime."

"The inhabitants of a frequently cold and windy country like the UK need to heat their homes, even in what is loosely termed “summer”. This is achieved mostly by natural gas-fed boilers – but this dependence on gas is unsustainable in the long term if the country aims to meet its targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050. In 2013, the government published a heat strategy and this year it extended the Renewable Heat Incentive from non-domestic buildings to also include homes. This provides a subsidy to people installing low-carbon heating technologies, with the aim of building up new markets and supply chains, pushing down costs and expanding the take-up of low-carbon heating. But the list of technologies for which a subsidy is currently available – heat pumps, biomass boilers and solar thermal heating – excludes hydrogen and fuel cell technologies, despite studies that show they could contribute to hitting emissions targets in 2050. Heat pumps are the most controversial inclusion in the list, as currently they generate more emissions gas boilers when the electricity needed to operate them is taken into account. This inconsistency stems from the the fact that the subsidy’s aim is to contribute toward the EU obligation of generating 20% of energy consumption from renewables by 2020, rather than to cut overall greenhouse gas emissions.  The ambient heat used by heat pumps counts towards this EU obligation, while the emissions from the electricity generation are overlooked. This policy will increase UK emissions in the next few years if many people swap their gas boilers for heat pumps. Our team of scientists from UCL and Imperial College London published a report that challenges the orthodoxy displayed by these slim selection of technologies, exploring the potential for fuel cells and other hydrogen-powered technologies to contribute to the heating market. Fuel cells, which generate electricity from chemical reactions, are already in use around the world for heating. Although they have mainly been viewed in Britain as a future power source for vehicles, in fact more commercial fuel cells have been sold for heating than for any other use. Sales of residential fuel cells have been doubling annually in Japan, Korea and in Europe. At the same time fuel cell costs have fallen substantially in recent years, to the extent that they will be sold without subsidised in Japan from 2015. These fuel cells are powered by natural gas, which is reformed into hydrogen within the fuel cell. If these were used in the UK, the net carbon emissions would be lower than using heat pumps for at least the next ten years. This is because emissions from electricity generation (0.48kg CO2/kWh) are currently much higher than those from natural gas (0.19kg CO2/kWh). This gap will gradually close as more renewables are built and coal power stations are retired. Further into the future, it might be possible to pipe hydrogen to homes and businesses as a low-carbon alternative to natural gas. Hydrogen could replace natural gas in modern, efficient condensing boilers or power fuel cells. This would avoid some of the disadvantages of alternative technologies such as heat pumps, which have high up-front costs, perform poorly if installed badly, and take up a lot of space in homes and buildings. Hydrogen can be produced from numerous fuels, reducing the reliance of the UK on oil and gas from abroad. As they operate apart from the national grid, fuel cells provide decentralised electricity generation, reducing load on the grid and providing power even during blackouts. Fuel cells could also help to avoid costly changes to the electricity networks in the future by generating electricity at peak times, in the event that the use of heat pumps and electric cars becomes more widespread. Despite the potential benefits, hydrogen and fuel cells have consistently been excluded or marginalised in government technology assessments, which instead focus only on those technologies in the Renewable Heat Incentive, together with combined heat and power systems and district heating. Most UK-focused studies used to support policy papers have also not considered hydrogen and fuel cells. The fact is that without government support in the early development stages, no low-carbon technology will be successful. Policies to address market failures for low-carbon heat technologies generally don’t include fuel cells and hydrogen – despite the fact that in other countries such as Japan, such support has provided the springboard required for the technology to reach commercial maturity. While the Renewable Heat Incentive does have a procedure for supporting new technologies, there is no prospect of this being used to support either fuel cells or hydrogen in the near future.  There is a big opportunity for Britain to develop a successful hydrogen and fuel cell industry for heating: the UK has a strong scientific and engineering research base, and support at home would enable UK companies to capture a share of fast-growing global supply chains. The potential of hydrogen and fuel cells – to provide homes and businesses with secure, low-carbon heat and – means that it’s high time they were considered in government roadmaps and policies, on a level playing field with other low-carbon technologies, and brought in from the cold."

"Volcanic eruptions played an important and direct role in triggering the extreme climate that killed off swathes of life at the end of the Triassic period 201m years ago, researchers have found. Experts say they have discovered bubbles of carbon dioxide trapped in volcanic rocks dating to the end of the Triassic, backing up the theory that such activity contributed to the greenhouse climate that is believed to have been behind the mass extinction.  “This biotic crisis wiped out almost half of the existing species of the late Triassic in both marine and terrestrial realms,” said Manfredo Capriolo of the University of Padova in Italy, a co-author of the study. While Capriolo noted the end-Triassic mass extinction has long been known to have been caused by extreme climate change, and that there was large-scale volcanic activity at the time, he said it had been unclear whether the volcanic activity directly contributed to the extinction event. Among other possibilities, he said, it could have been that magma caused the emission of gases as it flowed into shallow sediments.  The new work, said Capriolo, shows that carbon dioxide released directly by volcanic activity would indeed have made a large contribution to the devastating climate change of the time. Indeed the team say the amount of carbon emissions released in a single pulse of eruptions – which would have resulted in about 100,000 km3 of lava being spewed forth over 500 years – is on a par with the total expected to be produced by human activity over the 21st century, assuming a 2C rise in global temperature above pre-industrial levels. That, they say, offers a sobering warning for today. “[This] suggests that the end-Triassic climatic and environmental changes, driven by CO2 emissions, may have been similar to those predicted for the near future,” the team write. Capriolo stressed the similarity in CO2 levels was striking. “The end-Triassic world and the modern one are very different, as well as the origin of the greenhouse gas emissions, but we, as geoscientists, announce this alarming comparison,” he said. Writing in the journal Nature Communications, Capriolo and colleagues report how they studied more than 200 samples of rock from North America, Morocco and Portugal. These were deposited towards the end of the Triassic, in volcanic activity that contributed to the breakup of the Pangea supercontinent and the opening up of the central Atlantic Ocean, with the rocks creating what is known as the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province – a vast expanse covering an area about a third of the size the moon. The team found around 10% of the samples showed the presences of bubbles within small blobs of magma trapped by crystals in the rocks, most of which were found to contain carbon dioxide. Further analysis, they say, suggests the gas probably became entrapped deep within the Earth’s crust, suggesting it originated in the lower-middle crust or in the mantle. From these findings the team were able to calculate the concentration of carbon dioxide that would have been present in the magma of the volcanic eruptions, revealing that up to 100,000 Gt of carbon dioxide would have been released in total as the volcanic rocks were laid down. Dr Jessica Whiteside, associate professor of geochemistry at the University of Southampton who was not involved in the work, said the role of volcanic activity in the end-Triassic mass extinction had been a matter of much debate. “Over the past 30 years, the question as to whether widespread volcanic eruptions trigger climatic effects severe enough to result in extinction has waxed and waned, from most certainly no to most certainly yes,” she said.  The new study, she said, added weight to the latter view. “The study reports new evidence that is the most conclusive that has been produced for CO2 being emitted directly from individual lava eruptions relating to the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province,” she said, adding that the report reveals pulses of the eruptions spewed out amounts on a par to those produced by human activities, with devastating effects. That, Whiteside added, provided lessons for today. “The initiation of these eruptions created one of the warmest climate since the dawn of animal life on our planet, and coincided with massive extinction on land and in the oceans,” she said."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe computer models are beginning to show a blast of Arctic air coming to western Europe by next weekend.

Europe temperature forecast for 2 – 10 December 2012. Source: http://wxmaps.org/pix/temp4.html.
Over the last couple of days, the forecast seems to be converging on a cold wave, increasingly indicating a cold blast in the pipeline. We’ll know more in the next 72 hours. Right now there’s about a 2/3 chance this will happen (according to my models).
Explanation why
If this happens, it only confirms that the globe is getting warmer. At least that’s what the latest models and science from leading German, government-funded institutes have been claiming over the last couple of years.
Stefan Rahmstorf said for example that European winters will get warmer overall, but there will be more frequent cold waves because the Arctic is warm, which in turn will act to refrigerate the northern hemisphere in the wintertime – all of this is caused by global warming, even though the southern hemisphere is cooling. Makes perfect sense, doesn’t it?
Let me explain it to you anyway. You see, warm air rising from the 2 million sq km of extra open water over the Arctic causes huge air masses to sweep down south and put the remaining 200+ million sq km of the northern hemisphere into a deep freeze. If you look at the following graphic, you’ll see how this makes perfect sense.
How a warm Arctic refrigerates the northern hemisphere during the winter.

The red dot over the Arctic represents 2 million sq km of extra open water during the autumn, which acts to refrigerate the remaining 200+ million sq-km of the northern hemisphere during the winter. Chart source: Plumbago, the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 or any later. Red dot and arrows added.
So using the latest and most sophisticated model results coming from the renown German climate institutes, we see that 1% of the Arctic indeed overwhelms and drives the remaining 99% of the northern hemisphere.
But wouldn’t the 99% of the northern hemisphere drive the 1% Arctic?
No!
Of course not. The sophisticated models tell us it’s the other way around. Just like 0.04% trace gas CO2 now dominates 99.96% of the atmosphere, 1% of the Earth’s surface domineers the remaining 99%. That’s how nature works today, the Nobel Peace Prize winning climate scientists say. They’re experts and who are we to doubt them? Besides, the media believe it, and so you should too.
Just believe the climatologists.

"Financial help from taxpayers to airlines hit by the coronavirus crisis must come with strict conditions on their future climate impact, the former EU climate commissioner and a group of green campaigners have said. “It must be conditional, otherwise when we recover we will see the same or higher levels of carbon dioxide [from flying],” said Miguel Arias Cañete, the EU climate commissioner who led the bloc to the Paris agreement, in an interview with the Guardian. “We know the level of emissions we have to commit to [under Paris]. They [airlines] are worried about survival and will need lots of support, lots of liquidity – that gives them a big responsibility.”  A group of 26 civil society groups in the UK have written to the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, demanding “stringent conditions” on any rescue, including strict targets on greenhouse gases in line with the Paris agreement and measures to help workers. “Public money must be used to address social and environmental priorities, as well as economic needs,” they wrote. Aviation has all but ceased in some countries and flights are vastly down in most others, owing to the lockdowns and other suppression measures. Airlines have been appealing to governments for bailouts as fleets have been grounded. But campaigners and experts fear that after the Covid-19 outbreak has waned, the sector could bounce back with the aid of public money and send emissions soaring. In their letter to the chancellor, the campaigners – including Greenpeace, Flight Free, the IPPR and New Economics Foundation thinktanks, and Tax Justice – call for the government to take equity stakes in airlines rather than handing out cash or loans. They want to see social benefits with workers’ rights enforced, including a living wage and no mass redundancies a condition of any rescue. In the longer term, they want to see support for a “just transition” for workers to move to jobs in lower carbon industries. They also want a new fiscal regime that includes a frequent flyer levy or air miles levy, replacing air passenger duty, which would reduce demand without removing access to flights from those with limited alternatives or limited resources, by shifting the tax burden to frequent leisure flyers. About half of people in the UK do not fly in any given year, but 1% of people take a fifth of all flights. Rebecca Newsom, head of political affairs at Greenpeace UK, said: “Emergency funding must be used to tackle emergencies, not to support business as usual. Conditions are needed to protect workers’ rights, prevent public money from being diverted into the pockets of shareholders, and reduce demand gradually over time through a frequent flier levy, so that the sector operates within safe limits for the climate.” Attaching conditions to any bailout could take several forms. Cañete wants to see a carbon tax or emissions trading system such as the one operating under the EU. “Market mechanisms are needed,” he said. Airlines UK, a trade body, said the industry was already taking steps to reduce their environmental impact before the coronavirus crisis hit. “The UK aviation sector has already committed to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050 – the only national aviation industry to do so,” said a spokesperson. “This will be achieved via a range of measures, including airspace modernisation, the development and commercialisation of sustainable aviation fuels, new cleaner planes, and the UN carbon offsetting scheme Corsia.” Airlines face difficult choices ahead. More efficient aircraft will help to reduce emissions, but the impact will be limited. Biofuels offer a possible answer, but they are still expensive and there are difficulties in ensuring that the sources are environmentally sustainable. Electric planes are still some way in the future, and solar-powered flight a distant dream. “We need to stimulate research and development into things like hydrogen fuel,” said Barbara Buchner, managing director of the Climate Policy Initiative. “We need more proactive thinking from airlines – they can’t imagine we will go back to the way they were before.” The coronavirus disruption may also bring about permanent changes in people’s habits, some experts hope. Business flying has stopped meetings from happening, but people have found ways to work with video conferencing and other cheap technology, forcing businesses to question whether their staff need to fly as much in future. These eight companies These eight companies are among those who will help you offset your carbon emissions. Here is an indication of the cost, and where the money will be spent: Climate CareCost: £17.61 for 2.35 tonnesProjects: Safe drinking water in Malawi, fuel efficiency in Ghana, landfill energy in Thailand, rainforests in Brazil AtmosfairCost: £106 for 5 tonnesProjects: Energy efficiency in South Africa, biogas in Nepal, wind and hydro power Carbonfund.orgCost: $47 for 2.24 tonnesProjects: Water treatment in Kenya, hydroelectric in India ClevelCost: £38.74 for 2.6 tonnesProjects: Restoring grasslands in Mongolia, reducing deforestation in Tanzania FlygreenCost: £20.79 for 2.4 tonnesProjects: Solar panels in India MyclimateCost: £72 for 3.1 tonnesProjects: Energy efficiency in Africa, reforestation in Nicaragua Carbonfootprint.comCost: Between £7 and £30 a tonneProjects: Borehole rehabilitation in Uganda, hydroelectric in Chile Gold StandardCost: Asks you to calculate your own emissions and choose a projectProjects: Water purifiers in Cambodia, fuel-efficient stoves in Sudan “We are not flying as much – why not keep not flying?” asked Kevin Anderson, professor of energy and climate change at Manchester University. “Why not reinforce the good things that are coming out of Covid-19?” One effect of the coronavirus crisis has yet to be felt. Under the Corsia (Carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation) system adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organisation, airlines would have to curb their future emissions using efficiencies, alternative fuels and offsetting, such as investing in forests, renewable energy or other carbon-cutting projects. Before the coronavirus crisis emerged, airlines pushed for the average emissions in the years 2019 and 2020 to be used as the baseline by which future emissions would be judged. In any years from 2021 onwards, when emissions from the sector exceed the average of 2019 and 2020, the difference between actual emissions and the baseline will have to be offset, meaning airlines will have to buy carbon credits from carbon-cutting projects. Choosing 2019 and 2020 should have made those targets easy to meet for airlines if air travel had continued to rise this year as it has in recent years. With the Covid-19 pandemic, however, the disruption to travel means emissions are likely to be drastically lower than envisaged for 2020 – meaning Corsia’s future carbon targets will be much tougher for them to reach, if the scheme goes ahead without changes."

For years India has disappointed expectations. Tagged as the next great power preparing to challenge China and eventually America, India instead has lagged economically, stagnated politically, and battled religiously. Now Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has won a stunning political victory. India’s future depends on Modi’s ability to transcend his sectarian roots and govern on behalf of all Indians.



India achieved political independence in 1947, when the British colony was divided into largely Hindu India and mostly Muslim Pakistan. Twelve million people abandoned their homes and hundreds of thousands of them died in the process. Nevertheless, many religious minorities remained behind. For instance, India’s Muslim population runs roughly 177 million, the 3rd largest on earth — behind only Indonesia and Pakistan.



Throughout the Cold War the Delhi government kept its people poor by mismanaging the economy. Indian officials followed Stalinist economic nostrums to develop and depended on foreign aid to make ends meet. Politics was dominated by the dynastic India National Congress Party, which treated the system as the property of the Nehru‐​Gandhi family. Eventually change came to India: the Congress Party began economic reforms and the BJP broke the Congress political monopoly.



India is a secular republic in which freedom of religion is formally protected. However, legislation authorizes government interference in the name of preventing conduct “promoting enmity,” undermining “harmony,” intending to “outrage religious feelings,” insult “religious beliefs,” and more. In these cases, noted the State Department’s report on religious liberty, Delhi restricts “minorities’ freedom of speech and freedom of assembly.” Moreover, 7 of 28 states have passed anti‐​conversion laws, which target proselytizing.





The Indian people need more opportunity, not more dependency.



Of particular concern is the government’s inability or unwillingness to combat religious violence and prosecute those responsible. Explained the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom: “Despite the country’s status as a pluralistic, secular democracy, India has struggled to protect minority communities or provide justice when crimes occur due to a lack of political will, political corruption, and religious bias by government officials. This exacerbates the climate of impunity that already exists in the country.”



Much violence occurs between the two largest groups, Hindus and Muslims, but other religious minorities also are targeted. In 2007 and 2008 in the state of Odisha (formerly known as Orissa) rioting Hindus murdered scores of Christians, forced thousands to flee, and destroyed many homes and churches. Mobs even torched a Christian orphanage, killing a 21‐​year‐​old Hindu teacher. The pogram was long in the making. In 2007 Human Rights Watch reported: “For several years, extremist Hindu groups in Orissa have been conducting an anti‐​Christian campaign that has grown violent at times, while government officials have looked the other way.”



Earlier this year Hindu radicals attacked a house church in the southern province of Karnataka — police then arrested _the minister and several church members_ for allegedly coercing conversions. A report from the Mumbai‐​based Catholic‐​Secular Forum and several Christian organizations estimated that roughly 4000 Christians were targeted by acts of violence last year, most committed by Hindu extremists.



Unfortunately, India’s presumptive prime minister, Narendra Modi, was implicated in one of the country’s worst episodes of sectarian violence. In 2002 in the state of Gujarat, in which Modi served as chief minister, Hindu rioters killed more than 1200 people, mostly Muslims, and forced 150,000 people from their homes. Eventually the Indian military and national police restored order. Critics charged Modi with both encouraging the violence and failing to stop it. Investigations and court cases went on for years.



Several cabinet ministers were found to be involved, but specific evidence of Modi’s culpability was lacking — or perhaps destroyed. So Modi was absolved of responsibility, though prosecutors may not have looked very hard. He defends his conduct, saying he only wishes he had handled the media better.



In any case, Modi has ridden a sectarian tide to power. He graduated to the BJP from the Hindu nationalist group Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (“National Volunteer Society”), which he joined young. He denounced Muslims early in his career and was involved in activities leading to communal violence in 1992 when a massive Hindu mob destroyed the Babri Mosque in the city of Ayodhya. He refused to condemn riots last year in the state of Uttar Pradesh primarily directed against Muslims. This year he received strong backing from the RSS and ran for a second parliamentary seat from the Hindu holy city of Varanasi, which is seen as a center of Hinduism. A number of his closest associates are pronounced Hindu nationalists.



The good news in Modi’s victory is that he was elected to reform the faltering economy, not stoke the fires of religious hatred. Gujarat has prospered — with 5 percent of India’s population it accounts for 16 percent of industrial output and 22 percent of exports — and the BJP is committed to relaxing India’s often stultifying government regulations. The quickest way for the new government to discourage foreign investment would be to trigger more sectarian violence. Doing so also could be politically costly: Indian voters just demonstrated their impatience for results by slashing the Congress Party’s representation in parliament by roughly three‐​quarters.



Relations with the U.S. will be a key issue. The Bush administration took a dramatic leap by formally acknowledging Delhi’s acquisition of nuclear weapons. Doing so significantly improved bilateral ties. Since then, however, relations have stagnated, and recently suffered from trade disputes and criminal allegations against an Indian diplomat in New York.



Modi’s election poses another challenge. In 2005 the State Department refused to issue him a visa because of his presumed role in the Gujarat violence. James North of the blog Mondoweiss argued that resolute American opposition to Modi before the latest vote could have forced Indians to choose another prime minister. In fact, such a public stance almost certainly would have increased his support. Even Indians who don’t like Modi would not allow Washington to determine who ran their government.



Instead, the Obama administration has begun a diplomatic dance with Modi. The U.S. ambassador to India met with him in February in a visit presented as normal outreach to Indian political figures, signaling recognition that he was likely to triumph in the upcoming election. President Barack Obama congratulated Modi after the latter’s victory and extended an invitation to visit America. No doubt the visa ban will be quietly forgotten.



And none too soon, since Beijing also has formally welcomed Modi’s victory. While Washington has nothing for which to apologize — whatever Modi’s exact conduct in 2002, he has contributed to sectarian hatred — the U.S. cannot ignore the incoming head of the government of one of the world’s most important nations. Indeed, the U.S. long has dealt with far worse political leaders. And Washington’s embrace doesn’t mean Modi will have smooth sailing. Some Indian‐​Americans blame Modi for the Gujarat violence and helped establish the Coalition Against Genocide, which has threatened to file suit against him should he visit.



The responsibility to reconcile is not Washington’s alone. Set to become perhaps the most powerful Indian prime minister since Indira Gandhi three decades ago, he should attempt to set foreign governments and, even more important, his own citizens at ease.



After the election results were announced, he said that “The age of divisive politics has ended, from today onwards the politics of uniting people will begin.” It was a good beginning, but with many activists in both the RSS and BJP promoting Hindutva, or “Hinduness,” he needs to clearly communicate that he will be prime minister of all and his government will not tolerate violence or discrimination against religious minorities. Then he must live up to that promise. Political commentator Neerja Chowdhury argued: “Many people in India and around the world will be watching whether he reaches out to minorities in the coming days.” Doing so would enable Delhi to don the moral mantle of the world’s largest democracy, despite past communal strife.



Modi has a historic opportunity. His party carried both rural and urban areas, as well as younger voters, who now predominate in the electorate. His government will be the first in years to enjoy a solid majority in the Lok Sabha, or lower house. The people he will represent are both entrepreneurial and impatient, demanding the chance to better their lives.



However, he must get economic reform right. Although pro‐​business, he has not always been pro‐​market. Kleptocratic or crony corporatism may buy votes and reward friends, but it does not grow economies and increase wealth. The Indian people need more opportunity, not more dependency.



The choice soon will be up to Narendra Modi. Much around the globe depends on what he decides.

This from the AQUA earth-monitoring satellite. These tornadoes were so large they left visible brown gashes on the Alabama countryside. To help you find the gashes, storm chaser Aaron Kennedy put yellow lines parallel to the tornado’s tracks. I have added the arrows.  The city of Tuscaloosa is between the “a” and my first arrow.

I’m changing planes at O’Hare at the moment and just saw that the death toll is up to 250 per The Wall Street Journal and 272 per CNN. It is difficult to write this due to the shock that so many were killed when the forecasts and warnings were so good. That dichotomy is the question of the day.

"**Health bosses in the north-east of England are pushing to be allowed to run their own coronavirus tracing.**
The Newcastle Hospitals Trust is due to open a new Lighthouse lab able to process 80,000 tests a day in January.
The trust will also run a co-ordination hub providing virus data to help public health teams respond to local cases.
Chief operating officer Martin Wilson said it was ""making very strong representations"" to government about also localising contact tracing.
""We are keen to see a move to localised tracking and tracing,"" he said.
The trust was ""still in discussions"" about how the work of the Co-ordination Response Centre (CRC) hub could be extended to include this, he said.
The Department of Health and Social Care said local and national teams were ""working closely together"".
More than 150 councils were ""provided with extensive data and supported to manage local outbreaks"" with a ring-fenced group of contact tracers, a spokesperson said.
Newcastle City Council director of public health Prof Eugene Milne said the council wanted to ""stand the system on its head"" to have local teams managing cases and controlling work allocated to Test and Trace call handlers.
""Instead of the initial contact being through somebody remote, from a telephone number that you don't know, from somebody who doesn't know the local situation, the first call is from somebody who does understand all of those things,"" he said.
Talks were under way on whether the private companies currently running the tracing system would accept that, he said.
Most of the 1,000 lab staff would be analysing swab samples from people in the North East, Yorkshire and Humberside who had taken tests at home or at walk-in or drive-in centres.
About 100 staff would work in the CRC to give public health teams ""that real intelligence about where the cases are and they can act on it"", Mr Wilson said.
If local tracing was not allowed, lab results would be fed back into the centralised system to be sent out to individuals and passed to Test and Trace.
British Medical Association North East chairman Dr George Rae said contact tracing should be led by local public health teams, whose ""expertise and knowledge"" had not been used enough.
""I'm not saying that you don't want the national system but I think that the equilibrium has been massively imbalanced up to now,"" he said.

John Allison, CEO of the Cato Institute and former CEO of BB&T Corporation, announced today that Cato has established a new Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives, which will focus on development of policy recommendations that will create a more free‐​market monetary system in the U.S.



“We have assembled a group of scholars and advisory board members who will challenge the Federal Reserve and the financial regulators in a way they haven’t been challenged in 100 years,” Allison said.



George Selgin, a Professor Emeritus of Economics at the University of Georgia and one of the foremost authorities on banking and monetary theory and history, gave up his academic tenure to join Cato as director of the new center.



“If there’s ever to be a serious attempt to come up with something better than the Fed, we must bury the myth that it’s our only hope” Selgin said. “We don’t want to turn back the clock to 1913, or to any other bygone era. But we do need to change the intellectual climate from the present one — with its hostile and ill‐​informed response to any suggestion that a monetary system consistent with the rule of law and genuine competition might be an improvement upon our present autocratic central bank.”



Allison, who grew BB&T from $4.5 billion to $152 billion in assets during his 20 years as CEO, was recognized by the Harvard Business Review as one of the top 100 most successful CEOs in the world over the last decade.



“What I learned over my 40‐​year career in the banking business is that the more government micromanages lending and management practices, the less helpful real bankers can be to the lifeblood of the economy – small businesses and individuals,” said Allison.



The Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives will explore policy options that include creation of a private deposit insurance pool for small depositors, as well as measures that would expose even the largest financial institutions to a genuine risk of failure, and thereby compel them to either acquire more capital or take fewer risks.



“The new myth is that the recent financial crisis and failed recovery were caused by banking deregulation and greed on Wall Street,” Allison said in his book, The Financial Crisis and the Free Market Cure. “In truth, the banking industry was never deregulated…it was misregulated.”



Dodd‐​Frank has also given the Federal Reserve expanded powers which continue the agency down a path of hindering more than helping the economy.



“Since its inception, the Federal Reserve’s monetary policies have been a primary cause of artificial booms that lead to recessions and depressions,” Allison said.



In response, Cato’s monetary center will examine alternatives to pure discretionary government fiat money, including various monetary rules to reduce uncertainty and prevent the Federal Reserve from engaging in credit allocation and fiscal policy.



Luminaries from the banking policy world who have signed on to the Executive Advisory Council for the new Center include Richard Kovacevich, Chairman Emeritus of Wells Fargo, and George Melloan, former Deputy Editor of the _Wall Street Journal_.



The Council of Academic Advisors includes two Nobel Laureates in Economics, Thomas J. Sargent, from New York University, and Vernon L. Smith of Chapman University. John B. Taylor, a professor of economics at Stanford, Richard Timberlake, professor emeritus from the University of Georgia, and Guillermo Calvo, a professor of economics at Columbia University, also serve on the council.



James A. Dorn, Vice President for Monetary Studies and the long‐​time director of Cato’s annual monetary conference, will play a major role in management of the Center. Mark Calabria, Director of Financial Regulation Studies at Cato, will also move to the new Center. Before joining Cato in 2009, Calabria served six years as a senior staff member of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs.



“Our intent is that the work of the Center will result in a comprehensive, practical roadmap for implementing the fundamental policy reform needed to preserve liberty and prosperity through a free market monetary and financial system,” Selgin said.

"**Two pubs linked to a coronavirus outbreak have been ordered to close by the council.**
The Red Lion Inn and the Bell Hotel, both in Cardigan, were told on Friday to close their doors.
Ceredigion council said the action was taken in ""response to the serious and imminent threat to public health"" following 55 new cases in the area.
It said ""similar sanctions"" were being considered for other premises in the county.
The order will be reviewed within a week from Saturday.
Earlier this week the council called on people who had been at both pubs on or after 9 November to be ""extra vigilant and to self-isolate and book a test immediately if you have any symptoms""."
"Apologies in advance, but I’m hoping that reading this will help you feel depressed – about biodiversity loss and our lack of progress over the climate crisis. The thing is, in these extreme circumstances, a bit of depression about the environment could be precisely what we need – it’s the only sane response. That humans are having an unsustainable impact on Earth may have a become a familiar message – but it is still a difficult message to hear. It presents us with a complex challenge given our reluctance to face change.  Environmental campaigner Gus Speth once said he used to think the biggest problems facing the planet were biodiversity loss, ecosystem collapse and climate change. He believed that within 30 years, good science could address these problems. But, he continued:  I was wrong. The top environmental problems are selfishness, greed and apathy, and to deal with those we need a spiritual and cultural transformation. And we scientists don’t know how to do that. So who does know how to do that? Politicians? Economists? The problem with their solutions is the same problem that scientists face – they assume rational action from reasonable humans.  But humans can be largely irrational. When it comes to the environment, we often function like well-meaning addicts, earnestly promising to quit polluting the seas, poisoning the air, exploiting the natural world – and then continuing to do exactly that. So if we continue to look outwards for practical solutions, we will continue to fail. We also need to look inwards, at ourselves. And this is the job of psychotherapy – providing the emotional and relational maps to take us from catastrophe to transformation. As a member of the Climate Psychology Alliance (a group of academics, therapists, writers and artists) I believe that psychological understanding can help with the wide range of complex individual and cultural responses to the environmental crisis.  Feelings such as anger, guilt, grief, terror, shame, anxiety, despair and helplessness are all appropriate reactions. But defences against these feelings – denial and disavowal – mean we have avoided taking the necessary action to address their cause. “Climate psychology” is a different kind of psychology. Rather than see these feelings as something to be “fixed” or “cured”, we see them as healthy understandable responses – human reactions that empathise directly with the planet.  There is also value in understanding how grief, loss and mourning can shape our responses to climate change. For if we block out our emotions, then we are unable to connect with the urgency of the crisis – which may be one reason why we have so far failed to act sufficiently quickly.  In practice, what we do in climate psychology may not look that different from other psychological approaches on the surface. What is different is what lies underneath – how we think, see, reflect and respond. This includes exploring the unconscious dynamics that get in the way of us facing climate change reality, and confronting our denial and apathy. By using our understanding of psychic pain to help people face ecological loss that is already happening, we legitimise their grief. And by adopting a “climate change lens” through which we can see how the crisis is increasingly shaping the world, and which can bring people to therapy, we help people understand their distress.

      Climate change: 'We've created a civilisation hell bent on destroying itself – I'm terrified', writes Earth scientist


 The result, if we are willing to engage, is what sustainability expert Jem Bendell calls “deep adaptation”. We can change the way we feel about the crises, bring about a new connection – and then act. In our work we are increasingly seeing relationship fractures and personal distress stemming directly from the environmental crisis. Teenagers, for example, who feel alienated from their parents because they don’t share the same concerns about biodiversity loss.  I have talked with children who say they feel unable to trust their parents because of the older generation’s lack of action. I hear couples talk of marriages unable to bear the strain of one partner living in fear of the future, whilst the other places their faith in technology.  Using a climate psychology lens builds dialogue between these different positions. And through understanding and empathising with each position, people can begin to understand each other. After a climate psychology talk I gave recently, a woman who attended with her teenage daughter contacted me afterwards to say that on the way home they had their best conversation in years.  The parent had talked about her grief, guilt and fears that she could not protect her children. The daughter replied that she needed her mother’s support to participate in the school climate strikes. They found common ground and a new relationship based on their fears and their need to take action together. In cases of people suffering from eco-anxiety and similar issues, the hope is to find paths towards a new world shaped by a deepening understanding of our relationship with the planet and how our future is ultimately entwined with the survival of other creatures.  Then by using this understanding we can help navigate confusing, strange and frightening territories. Through acknowledging painful feelings, we can start to see them as holding transformational potential. It is this emotional growth that could save us. Depression is actually a step on the path that could lead back up to the surface.  As the American psychologist James Hillman said more than two decades ago:  Psychology, so dedicated to awakening the human consciousness, needs to wake itself up to one of the most ancient human truths: We cannot be studied or cured apart from the planet.

Guest post by Michael Dickey (cross posted from his website matus1976.com)
The decline of nuclear power has had a significant effect on global  carbon emissions and subsequently any anthropogenic global warming  effect. To see the extent of this influence, let us first take a look at  total U.S. carbon emissions since 1900.

According to the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center, from 1900  to 2006, US carbon emissions rose from 181 MMT (million metric tons) to  1,569 MMT.

Taking a look at US electricity generation by type, according to the  Energy Information Administration, the U.S. generates 51% of its power  from coal, and cumulatively about 71% of its power from fossil fuel  sources.


Comparing the energy source to Carbon emissions, the burning of coal to  generate electricity alone emits more CO2 than any other single source,  about one-third of the total.
As the US Electrical Generation by Type figure shows, about 20% of the  U.S. electrical supply comes from nuclear power.  Let us now imagine  that the U.S. never built any nuclear power plants, but instead built  more coal plants to generate the electricity those nuclear plants would  have generated.
According to the Energy Information Administration, since 1971, 18.6  billion MW•h (Megawatt hour) of electrical power have been generated by  nuclear sources (1).  According to the US Department of Energy, every  kW•h (kilowatt hour) of electricity generated by coal produces 2.095 lbs  of CO2 (2).

As the calculations in the table above show, every MW•h of electricity  generated by coal generates 2,095 pounds of carbon dioxide. For 18.6  billion MW•h at 2,095 pounds of CO2 per MW•h, this amounts to 39.0  trillion additional lbs of CO2, or 17.7 billion metric tons.  Finally,  converting the 17.7 billion metric tons of CO2 to carbon results in  4.842 billion, or 4,842 million metric tons of carbon.
What all this shows is that had this power been generated by coal  plants, an additional 4,842 million metric tons of carbon would have  been released into the atmosphere. Breaking this calculation down by  year, what would this have made our carbon emissions record look like?

Again in blue we see the real world US carbon emissions, but in green we  see what the carbon emissions would have been if all the electricity  generated by our nuclear infrastructure had instead been generated by  coal power plants.
In all, carbon emissions would have been 14.6% higher, with 1,782 MMT of  carbon released without nuclear power plants, while only 1,552 MMT are  released with our current nuclear infrastructure.  This is why many  leading environmentalists, such as James Lovelock (author of the Gaia  Hypothesis) are vocal supporters of nuclear power.
But this chart is not entirely fair to nuclear power, because the growth  of nuclear power was severely derailed by environmentalist hyperbole  and outright scaremongering.  Because of the attacks by  environmentalists on nuclear power, many planned power plants were  cancelled, and many existing plants licenses were not renewed.  The  result, according to Al Gore himself in “Our Choice” was:
“Of the 253 nuclear power reactors originally ordered in the United  States from 1953 to 2008, 48 percent were canceled, 11 percent were  prematurely shut down, 14 percent experienced at least a  one-year-or-more outage…Thus, only about one-fourth of those ordered, or  about half of those completed, are still operating.” (3)
Let us take a look then at U.S. carbon emissions if the U.S. had simply  built and operated the power plants that were originally planned.

Yup, that’s right people: if the US had simply built and operated the  nuclear power plants it had planned and licensed, it would today be  producing not only less carbon emissions than it did in 1972, but would  in fact be emitting almost half the carbon emissions it is now.
But let’s not forget that the very planning and licensing of nuclear  power plants was drastically affected by the anti-scientific opposition.   Looking again at the Energy Information Administrations figures, the  average sustained growth for nuclear generating capacity was increasing  by about 28.8 million Megawatt hours for a 20 year period from 1971 to  1989
Here we see a chart taken from the EIA data which shows the growth of  real nuclear generating capacity in blue, and the projected growth in  red, had the growth of the previous 20 year period been sustained  (remember, this is still only about one-fourth of the intended  capacity).  In this graph, any year which produced less than the average  of the previous 20 years was increased to that average of 28.8 million  MW•h.

Now let’s take this projected growth and imagine the U.S. had actually  built a nuclear infrastructure at this level. What would our carbon  emissions look like?

Incredibly, U.S. carbon emissions today would be almost one-fourth of  what they are currently.  These numbers are estimated by taking the  average yearly increase from 1971 to 1989 in nuclear generating capacity  and projecting it to the current day, and since these numbers are only  one-fourth of the original planned capacity, the result is multiplied by  four.  In case you think my numbers are fanciful, let’s see if there  are any countries out there that did not get entirely persuaded by the  anti-nuclear hysteria, and how that affected their carbon emissions.

After the energy crisis of the 70s, France, which was highly dependent  on imported oil for electricity production, decided to divest themselves  of Middle Eastern oil dependence.  Lacking significant fossil fuel  deposits, they opted for a nuclear infrastructure.  Today nuclear power  generates about 78% of France’s electrical power supply, and it is today  the world’s largest exporter of electrical energy.  France alone  accounts for 47% of Western Europe’s nuclear generated electricity (3).
While we do not see the production in France dropping to half of its  1970s levels as we would have in the U.S. had it continued the  transition to a nuclear infrastructure, nevertheless the 40% reductions  are close and tremendously significant.
Consider from the presented information what the total potential nuclear  generating capacity for the US would be if it sustained the high level  growth and achieved its planned capacity.

By the year 2000, the US nuclear infrastructure could have been  generating 100% of the domestic electrical supply.  This is not an  extraordinary claim considering, again, that France generates 78% of  electrical energy from nuclear power.
Extrapolating this to the global climate, let’s take a look at the  global carbon emissions levels and compare them against a world where  the U.S. sustained the first two decades of its nuclear infrastructure  growth perpetually and ultimately achieved the original planned  capacity.

In green, we see the existing global carbon emissions levels and in  purple is the U.S. carbon emission levels if it continued to adopt a  nuclear infrastructure.  In red then, as a result, we see the global  carbon levels would have been almost 15% lower than current levels.
I invite readers to extrapolate then where the total global carbon  emissions would be if all the post-industrialized nations had adopted  nuclear power – as their natural technological progressions would have  dictated – if it were not for the hijacking of this process by  anti-scientific hyperbole by scaremongering environmental activists.   Many organizations – such as Green Peace, still ardently oppose nuclear  power.  And these levels, mind you, are only about one-tenth of what the  Atomic Energy Commission was projecting based on demand during the 60s,  where at its height 25 new nuclear power plants were being built every  year, and the AEC anticipated that by the year 2000 over 1,000 nuclear  power plants would be in operation in the U.S..  Today only 104 operate.
Let us project an educated guess as to what the resulting reduction in  carbon emissions would have been had the European Union (which in 2005  generated 15% of their electricity with nuclear) Japan (34.5% nuclear)  and finally, going into the future China and India as they fully  industrialize.

All of these facts lead to one conclusion: if manmade global warming is a  real problem, then it was in fact caused by environmental alarmism.   That is not to say that some environmentalism has not been good, but  this atrocious abandonment of reason hangs as an ominous cloud over  everything environmentalists advocate.  Rational environmentalists, such  as James Lovelock, who want a high standard of living for humans and a  clean planet are quick to change their minds about nuclear power.   Irrational environmentalists who actually do not desire wealthy,  comfortable lives for all people on the planet–as well as a clean  planet–actively oppose nuclear power.  Nuclear power is a litmus test  for integrity within the environmentalist community.
If you want to spur the economy, stop global warming, and undermine the  oil-fueled, terrorist-breeding, murderous theocracies of the world, the  solution is simple: build nuclear power plants.

"**The coronavirus pandemic has meant some people have needed to use video-conferencing software to kick their drug and alcohol addictions.**
Gary Besterfield, from We Are With You Redcar and Cleveland, said software had meant the charity could support more people.
Jade Hargreaves, from Burnley, has been sober for three years and said losing face-to-face meetings was difficult.
""But people have got clean this year on Zoom and that's amazing. Hats off to them because it's hard,"" she said.
Recovery services have had to adapt in 2020 and with demand increasing, We Are With You, formerly known as Addaction, said lessons had been learned in lockdown that would shape the way it worked in future.
Founded in 1967, it has offered support to people struggling with drug, alcohol or mental health issues and said the impact of the pandemic was evident in the number of people using its web chat service to speak to advisers.
Jade Hargreaves said losing face-to-face meetings during lockdown had been difficult.
Speaking to the BBC podcast Unusual Times, she said: ""We've all had to get used to Zoom. I'm all 'Zoomed out' but it's become a daily thing.
""I think we're entering a new normal but, for people like me, we need to be able to see someone's eyes and see how they're responding and building up trust and, when you're new to recovery, you really need that.""
It was traumatic events in her teenage years that led to her drug and alcohol addiction, Jade said.
""My dad committed suicide when I was 13. Six months later I found out my mum was dying of cancer.
""I ended up addicted to alcohol and then other drugs. I guess I didn't know that because my mental health was embroiled in it.
""I spent time on psychiatric units and spent a good patch of time homeless. It was very chaotic.""
The first step in Jade's recovery was getting help from Centrepoint - a charity that provides accommodation to support homeless people aged 16-25.
""How can you get back on form without a stable place to live? You just can't, because your basic needs aren't being met,"" she said.
""It started once I got accommodated and had support workers saying 'what about college?' and believing in me.""
Jade said things got worse before they got better but with a partner, a home, two children and a level of stability, she felt in a much better place than she had been, but the pandemic had almost caused a relapse.
She said when lockdown first began in March she nearly went to the shop to buy some alcohol.
""I thought 'you've worked hard, Jade, you deserve a drink' and if it wasn't for my partner saying 'I won't be around for long if you do' I think I would have had a drink.
""I'd started to isolate myself, not through choice, I didn't have the connection I had with other people. It was hard not having face-to-face meetings and seeing my friends who are clean too.
""The sad thing is, throughout lockdown, some of my friends have died and I firmly believe it's because everything got closed down. The connection that people like me need all got took away.
""There's four people I know who've died this year through overdosing, and a lot of my friends have relapsed"".
Gary Besterfield has been working in the sector for 20 years and said people accessed services because they were going through a difficult period and were often dealing with some form of loss.
This month, the number of web chat conversations was 91% higher than a year ago. In October, the service saw a 117% rise.
And the charity expected to see ""a significant increase"" in demand in 2021 as it entered January - a ""notoriously busy"" period for treatment services.
Meetings play an important part in recovery - both for those seeking help for the first time, and those who have been in treatment for longer.
""In what is a testing year, people are losing their position in society, their jobs, their loved ones and there's increased isolation,"" he said.
""Lockdown has enabled us to open the doors to those people that might not come through our services usually but are more likely to engage with us digitally.
""We need to make sure people know they may not need to actually come in and can talk to us over the phone or on a laptop.""
Dan Owens, from Hastings, first took drugs when he was 14.
Moving through his teenage years, his drug use went from cannabis to ecstasy. In the years that followed he ""went through everything"".
""A few years ago I started calming down but in the process I found myself with a dependency on benzodiazepines and only a year ago I was dependant on opiates.
""You name it, I'd take it. I was a complete mess.
""I sorted myself out and went to a recovery clinic. It was very hard, very difficult. I hadn't learnt how to deal with reality - I had no resilience.
""It took me about 10 months to gradually wean myself off. This was during lockdown as well so it was even more difficult.
""There isn't a support system really because you can't see your friends. It's challenging and I think a lot of people will be experiencing the same.
""It's when you're in isolation these sort of risk-taking behaviours can come to light.""
The 31-year-old has just started a role as a peer mentor with drugs charity Change Grow Live.
""A lot of the meetings are through Zoom at the moment. It seems like they've got the service running the best it can. Hopefully in the new year things will change and we can see those centres open again.""

Did you notice that the major economic forecasters, both private and government, totally missed the global credit crisis and size of the recession?



The mainstream consensus economic forecasts made in December 2007 for the year 2008 for the United States, Europe and Japan predicted roughly twice as much growth as actually occurred. You may recall that a year ago, when oil prices were racing toward $147 per barrel, the high‐​paid wizards at Goldman Sachs were projecting it to go over $200 per barrel — it is now $40‐​something a barrel. A few economists claim to have forecast this great recession, but most have been pessimists for years, and predicting nine out of the last three recessions is not really an example of forecasting brilliance.



The foreign policy/​political forecasts were even worse. A year ago, as the presidential nominees of both parties were being selected, the widely held belief was that the great issue would be Iraq. The Democratic establishment believed Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid’s words, “the war is lost.”



Because of that belief, the Democrats selected their most antiwar candidate, Barack Obama. The Republicans nominated John McCain, who was the champion of winning the war, in part, through the “surge,” which indeed did work.



Each candidate had essentially sewed up his respective party nominations before the extent of the economic problems became clear. In retrospect, it is unlikely Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain would have become the nominees given what we know now about the economic situation. Each party had other candidates with stronger economic credentials who would have been more credible.



In the mid‐​1990s, when the fear of global warming was first becoming fashionable, the global warming theorists said we had only 10 years to make fundamental changes with carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions or the planet was doomed (i.e. the “hockey stick” thesis).



Well, it has now been more than 10 years and the planet has actually been getting cooler over the last decade, which was not forecast by a single major climate model (oh, well). Also the polar ice cap has not disappeared, and the polar bear population is getting bigger, not smaller! It seems those who claim the variable output of the sun (sun spot theorists) has more effect on Earth temperature than CO2 might just be right.



A major reason the global warming misinformation is still so hyped is that government subsidizes many producers of noneconomic alternative energy sources and many scientists with an economic interest in repeating the claim. Those in the political class love the idea of a climate crisis because it gives them more power and money to “do something about it.”



Getting it all wrong is not new. In 1900, Europe was enjoying unprecedented peace and prosperity. The European countries, and particularly Britain, had their global empires and great military powers. There was the widespread belief that major wars were a thing of the past and European civilization would dominate the globe forever. Twenty years later, in 1920, much of Europe lay in ruins in the wake of the World War I (a war about nothing), but there was certainty that Germany was being sufficiently constrained so as to never be a threat again. Yet, only another 20 years later, in 1940, the “German Thousand Year Reich” controlled most of Europe.



In 1980, much of the United States and European foreign policy establishment believed it was only a matter of time before the communists would win the Cold War. Fortunately, Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher had a different idea, and the Soviet Union collapsed a decade later to the great surprise of much of the global establishment.



The failure to forecast the current “crisis” appears to, in part, stem from the fact that few fully understood how much risk there was in the entire global financial system. There were too many mathematicians posing as financial experts and economists who did not have enough knowledge of economic history or long enough historical periods with sufficient data to measure risk as precisely as they claimed. As a result, they underestimated systemic risks.



In addition, too few — among both investors and forecasters — understood that when the rating agencies, like Moody’s, were rating packages of mortgage‐​backed securities, they were not ranking the individual components of the package, which turned out to cause a great understatement of the risk. Few politicians understood, or wanted to understand, that the pressure they put on the banks to lend to the unqualified was putting the whole system at risk, and many of the forecasters did not fully appreciate how much the banks had lowered their lending standards.



Economic forecasts are necessary for businesses and governments to plan and operate. Insurance companies could not exist without the science of probability and risk analysis and the existence of historical data banks. Because these organizations do have the necessary forecasting skills and data banks, they are able to offer homeowners’, auto and life insurance and price them properly.



Micro forecasts, where the variables are few, well‐​known and the data extensive, can be quite precise, fortunately, for the insurance industry. Macro forecasts, where the variables are many and often not well‐​understood, such as those used in climate, political and global economic models, can be wildly inaccurate and thus should be used only with great caution — and modesty.

On July 1, 2001, a nationwide law in Portugal took effect that decriminalized all drugs, including cocaine and heroin. Under the new legal framework, all drugs were “decriminalized,” not “legalized.” Thus, drug possession for personal use and drug usage itself are still legally prohibited, but violations of those prohibitions are deemed to be exclusively administrative violations and are removed completely from the criminal realm. Drug trafficking continues to be prosecuted as a criminal offense.



While other states in the European Union have developed various forms of de facto decriminalization — whereby substances perceived to be less serious (such as cannabis) rarely lead to criminal prosecution — Portugal remains the only EU member state with a law explicitly declaring drugs to be “decriminalized.” Because more than seven years have now elapsed since enactment of Portugal’s decriminalization system, there are ample data enabling its effects to be assessed.



Notably, decriminalization has become increasingly popular in Portugal since 2001. Except for some far‐​right politicians, very few domestic political factions are agitating for a repeal of the 2001 law. And while there is a widespread perception that bureaucratic changes need to be made to Portugal’s decriminalization framework to make it more efficient and effective, there is no real debate about whether drugs should once again be criminalized. More significantly, none of the nightmare scenarios touted by preenactment decriminalization opponents — from rampant increases in drug usage among the young to the transformation of Lisbon into a haven for “drug tourists” — has occurred.



The political consensus in favor of decriminalization is unsurprising in light of the relevant empirical data. Those data indicate that decriminalization has had no adverse effect on drug usage rates in Portugal, which, in numerous categories, are now among the lowest in the EU, particularly when compared with states with stringent criminalization regimes. Although postdecriminalization usage rates have remained roughly the same or even decreased slightly when compared with other EU states, drug‐​related pathologies — such as sexually transmitted diseases and deaths due to drug usage — have decreased dramatically. Drug policy experts attribute those positive trends to the enhanced ability of the Portuguese government to offer treatment programs to its citizens — enhancements made possible, for numerous reasons, by decriminalization.



This report will begin with an examination of the Portuguese decriminalization framework as set forth in law and in terms of how it functions in practice. Also examined is the political climate in Portugal both pre‐ and postdecriminalization with regard to drug policy, and the impetus that led that nation to adopt decriminalization.



The report then assesses Portuguese drug policy in the context of the EU’s approach to drugs. The varying legal frameworks, as well as the overall trend toward liberalization, are examined to enable a meaningful comparative assessment between Portuguese data and data from other EU states.



The report also sets forth the data concerning drug‐​related trends in Portugal both pre‐ and postdecriminalization. The effects of decriminalization in Portugal are examined both in absolute terms and in comparisons with other states that continue to criminalize drugs, particularly within the EU.



The data show that, judged by virtually every metric, the Portuguese decriminalization framework has been a resounding success. Within this success lie self‐​evident lessons that should guide drug policy debates around the world.

"We’ve all seen the impact of our plastic addiction. It’s hard to miss the devastating images of whales and sea birds that have died with their stomachs full of solidified fossil fuels. The recent discovery of a plastic bag in the Mariana Trench, at over 10,000 metres below sea level, reminds us of the depth of our problem. Now, the breadth is increasing too. New research suggests that chemicals leaching from the bags and bottles that pepper our seas are harming tiny marine organisms that are central to sustained human existence. Once plastic waste is out in the open, waves, wind and sunlight cause it to break down into smaller pieces. This fragmentation process releases chemical additives, originally added to imbue useful qualities such as rigidity, flexibility, resistance to flames or bacteria, or a simple splash of colour. Research has shown that the presence of these chemicals in fresh water and drinking water can have grave effects, ranging from reduced reproduction rates and egg hatching in fish, to hormone imbalances, reduced fertility or infertility, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and cancer in humans.

      Plastic warms the planet twice as much as aviation – here's how to make it climate-friendly


 But very little research has looked at how these additives might affect life in our oceans. To find out, researchers at Macquarie University prepared seawater contaminated with differing concentrations of chemicals leached from plastic bags and PVC, two of the most common plastics in the world. They then measured how living in such water affected the most abundant photosynthesising organism on Earth – Prochlorococcus. As well as being a critical foundation of the oceanic food chain, they produce 10% of the world’s oxygen. The results indicate that the scale and potential impacts of plastic pollution may be far greater than most of us had imagined. They showed that the chemical-contaminated seawater severely reduced the bacteria’s rate of growth and oxygen production. In most cases, bacteria populations actually declined. Given the importance of oxygen levels to the rate of global heating, and the vital role these phytoplankton play in ensuring thriving marine ecosystems, it is essential that we now conduct research outside of the laboratory into the effects of plastic additives on bacteria in the open seas. In the meantime, we need to take active steps to reduce the risks of chemical plastic pollution. The clear first step is to reduce the amount of plastic entering the ocean. Recent EU and UK bans on single-use plastics are a start, but much more radical policies are needed now to reduce the role plastic plays in our lives as well as to stop the plastic we do use being released into waterways and dramatically improve appallingly low recycling rates. At an international level, we must make addressing the waste produced by the fishing industry a priority. Broken fishing nets alone account for almost half of the plastic in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch – and lost or discarded fishing gear accounts for one-third of the plastic litter in European seas. EU incentives announced in 2019 to tackle this waste do not go far enough. Legislation is also urgently needed to limit the industrial use of harmful chemical additives to a level that is absolutely necessary. As an example, bisphenol A, found in myriad products ranging from receipt paper to rubber ducks, is now listed as a “substance of very high concern” due to its hormone-disrupting effects. But as yet the few existing laws regulating the chemical do not cover the majority of industrial use. This needs to change – as quickly as possible. Of course, even if we can completely stop new chemicals from reaching the oceans, we will still have a legacy of plastic and associated chemical pollution to deal with. At the moment, we have no idea whether we’ve already done irreversible damage, or if marine ecosystems are resilient to current levels of plastic pollution in the open oceans. But the health of our oceans is not something we can risk. So, in addition to physical removal schemes such as The Ocean Clean Up, we need to invest in chemical removal technologies as well. In salty ocean environments, such technologies are under-researched. We are currently in the early stages of developing a floating device that uses a small electric circuit to transform BPA into easily retrievable solid matter, but our work alone is not enough. Scientists and governments need to ramp up their efforts to both understand and eliminate the problem of chemical contamination of our oceans, before it’s too late.  While ocean bacteria may seem far removed from our daily lives, we are dependent on these tiny organisms to maintain the balance of our ecosystems. We ignore their plight at our peril."
"The coffee tasted bad. Acrid and with a sweet, sickly smell. The sort of coffee that results from overfilling the filter machine and then leaving the brew to stew on the hot plate for several hours. The sort of coffee I would drink continually during the day to keep whatever gears left in my head turning. Odours are powerfully connected to memories. And so it’s the smell of that bad coffee which has become entwined with the memory of my sudden realisation that we are facing utter ruin. It was the spring of 2011, and I had managed to corner a very senior member of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) during a coffee break at a workshop. The IPCC was established in 1988 as a response to increasing concern that the observed changes in the Earth’s climate are being largely caused by humans. The IPCC reviews the vast amounts of science being generated around climate change and produces assessment reports every four years. Given the impact the IPPC’s findings can have on policy and industry, great care is made to carefully present and communicate its scientific findings. So I wasn’t expecting much when I straight out asked him how much warming he thought we were going to achieve before we manage to make the required cuts to greenhouse gas emissions.  “Oh, I think we’re heading towards 3°C at least,” he said. “Ah, yes, but heading towards,” I countered: “We won’t get to 3°C, will we?” (Because whatever you think of the 2°C threshold that separates “safe” from “dangerous” climate change, 3°C is well beyond what much of the world could bear.) “Not so,” he replied. That wasn’t his hedge, but his best assessment of where, after all the political, economic, and social wrangling we will end up. “But what about the many millions of people directly threatened,” I went on. “Those living in low-lying nations, the farmers affected by abrupt changes in weather, kids exposed to new diseases?” He gave a sigh, paused for a few seconds, and a sad, resigned smile crept over his face. He then simply said: “They will die.” This article is part of Conversation Insights The Conversation’s Insights team generates long-form journalism derived from interdisciplinary research. The team is working with academics from different backgrounds who have been engaged in projects aimed at tackling societal and scientific challenges. In generating these narratives we hope to bring areas of interdisciplinary research to a wider audience. You can read more Insights stories here. That episode marked a clear boundary between two stages of my academic career. At the time, I was a new lecturer in the area of complex systems and Earth system science. Previously, I had worked as a research scientist on an international astrobiology project based in Germany. In many ways, that had been my dream job. As a young boy, I had lain on the grass on clear summer evenings and looked up at one of the dots in the night sky and wondered if around that star a planet orbited with beings that could look up from the surface of their world and similarly wonder about the chances of life being found within the unremarkable solar system we call home in the universe. Years later, my research involves thinking about how surface life can affect the atmosphere, oceans and even rocks of the planet it lives on. That’s certainly the case with life on Earth. At a global scale, the air we all breathe contains oxygen largely as a result of photosynthetic life, while an important part of the UK’s national identity for some – the white cliffs of Dover – are comprised of countless numbers of tiny marine organisms that lived more than 70m years ago. So it wasn’t a very large step from thinking about how life has radically altered the Earth over billions of years to my new research that considers how a particular species has wrought major changes within the most recent few centuries. Whatever other attributes Homo sapiens may have – and much is made of our opposable thumbs, upright walking and big brains – our capacity to impact the environment far and wide is perhaps unprecedented in all of life’s history. If nothing else, we humans can make an almighty mess. I was born in the early 1970s. This means in my lifetime the number of people on Earth has doubled, while the size of wild animal populations has been reduced by 60%. Humanity has swung a wrecking ball through the biosphere. We have chopped down over half of the world’s rainforests and by the middle of this century there may not be much more than a quarter left. This has been accompanied by a massive loss in biodiversity, such that the biosphere may be entering one of the great mass extinction events in the history of life on Earth.  What makes this even more disturbing, is that these impacts are as yet largely unaffected by climate change. Climate change is the ghosts of impacts future. It has the potential to ratchet up whatever humans have done to even higher levels. Credible assessments conclude that one in six species are threatened with extinction if climate change continues.  The scientific community has been sounding the alarm over climate change for decades. The political and economic response has been at best sluggish. We know that in order to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, we need to rapidly reduce emissions now. The sudden increase in media coverage of climate change as a result of the actions of Extinction Rebellion and school strike for climate pioneer Greta Thunburg, demonstrates that wider society is waking up to the need for urgent action. Why has it taken the occupation of Parliament Square in London or children across the world walking out of school to get this message heard? There is another way of looking at how we have been responding to climate change and other environmental challenges. It’s both exhilarating and terrifying. Exhilarating because it offers a new perspective that could cut through inaction. Terrifying as it could, if we are not careful, lead to resignation and paralysis.

      Climate change: seeing the planet break down is depressing – here's how to turn your pain into action


 Because one explanation for our collective failure on climate change is that such collective action is perhaps impossible. It’s not that we don’t want to change, but that we can’t. We are locked into a planetary-scale system that while built by humans, is largely beyond our control. This system is called the technosphere. Coined by US geoscientist Peter Haff in 2014, the technosphere is the system that consists of individual humans, human societies – and stuff. In terms of stuff, humans have produced an extraordinary 30 trillion metric tons of things. From skyscrapers to CDs, fountains to fondue sets. A good deal of this is infrastructure, such as roads and railways, which links humanity together.  Along with the physical transport of humans and the goods they consume is the transfer of information between humans and their machines. First through the spoken word, then parchment and paper-based documents, then radio waves converted to sound and pictures, and subsequently digital information sent via the internet. These networks facilitate human communities. From roving bands of hunter-gatherers and small farming tribes, right up to the inhabitants of a megacity that teams with over 10m inhabitants, Homo sapiens is a fundamentally social species.  Just as important, but much less tangible, is society and culture. The realm of ideas and beliefs, of habits and norms. Humans do a great many different things because in important ways they see the world in different ways. These differences are often held to be the root cause of our inability to take effective global action. There is no global government, for a start. But as different as we all are, the vast majority of humanity is now behaving in fundamentally similar ways. Yes, there are still some nomads who roam tropical rainforests, still some roving sea gypsies. But more than half of the global population now lives in urban environments and nearly all are in some way connected to industrialised activities. Most of humanity is tightly enmeshed into a globalised, industrialised complex system – that of the technosphere.  Importantly, the size, scale and power of the technosphere has dramatically grown since World War II. This tremendous increase in the number of humans, their energy and material consumption, food production and environmental impact has been dubbed the Great Acceleration. It seems sensible to assume that the reason products and services are made is so that they can be bought and sold and so the makers can turn a profit. So the drive for innovation – for faster, smaller phones, for example – is driven by being able to make more money by selling more phones. In line with this, the environmental writer George Monbiot argued that the root cause of climate change and other environmental calamities is capitalism and consequently any attempt to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will ultimately fail if we allow capitalism to continue.  But zooming out from the toil of individual manufacturers, and even humanity, allows us to take a fundamentally different perspective, one that transcends critiques of capitalism and other forms of government.  Humans consume. In the first instance, we must eat and drink in order to maintain our metabolism, to stay alive. Beyond that, we need shelter and protection from physical elements. There are also the things we need to perform our different jobs and activities and to travel to and from our jobs and activities. And beyond that is more discretional consumption: TVs, games consoles, jewellery, fashion. The purpose of humans in this context is to consume products and services. The more we consume, the more materials will be extracted from the Earth, and the more energy resources consumed, the more factories and infrastructure built. And ultimately, the more the technosphere will grow. The emergence and development of capitalism obviously lead to the growth of the  technosphere: the application of markets and legal systems allows increased consumption and so growth. But other political systems may serve the same purpose, with varying degrees of success. Recall the industrial output and environmental pollution of the former Soviet Union. In the modern world, all that matters is growth. The idea that growth is ultimately behind our unsustainable civilisation is not a new concept. Thomas Malthus famously argued there were limits to human population growth, while the Club of Rome’s 1972 book, Limits to Growth, presented simulation results that pointed to a collapse in global civilisation. Today, alternative narratives to the growth agenda are, perhaps, getting political traction with an All Party Parliamentary Group convening meetings and activities that seriously consider de-growth policies. And curbing growth within environmental limits is central to the idea of a Green New Deal, which is now being discussed seriously in the US, UK, and other nations.  If growth is the problem, then we just have to work at that, right? This won’t be easy, as growth is baked into every aspect of politics and economics. But we can at least imagine what a de-growth economy would look like.  My fear, however, is that we will not be able to slow down the growth of the technosphere even if we tried – because we are not actually in control.  It may seem nonsense that humans are unable to make important changes to the system they have built. But just how free are we? Rather than being masters of our own destiny, we may be very constrained in how we can act.  Like individual blood cells coursing through capillaries, humans are part of a global-scale system that provides for all their needs and so has led them to rely on it entirely. If you jump in your car to get to a particular destination, you can’t travel in a straight line “as the crow flies”. You will use roads that in some instances are older than your car, you, or even your nation. A significant fraction of human effort and endeavour is devoted to maintaining this fabric of the technosphere: fixing roads, railways, and buildings, for example.  In that respect, any change must be incremental because it must use what current and previous generations have built. The channelling of people via road networks seems a trivial way to demonstrate that what happened far in the past can constrain the present, but humanity’s path to decarbonisation isn’t going to be direct. It has to start from here and at least in the beginning use existing routes of development. This isn’t meant to excuse policymakers for their failure of ambition, or lack of bravery. But it indicates that there may be deeper reasons why carbon emissions are not decreasing even when there appears to be increasingly good news about alternatives to fossil fuels.  Think about it: at the global scale, we have witnessed a phenomenal rate of deployment of solar, wind, and other sources of renewable energy generation. But global greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise. This is because renewables promote growth – they simply represent another method of extracting energy, rather than replacing an existing one. The relationship between the size of the global economy and carbon emissions is so robust that US physicist Tim Garrett has proposed a very simple formula that links the two with startling accuracy. Using this method, an atmospheric scientist can predict the size of the global economy for the past 60 years with tremendous precision.  But correlation does not necessarily mean causation. That there has been a tight link between economic growth and carbon emissions does not mean that has to continue indefinitely. The tantalisingly simple explanation for this link is that the technosphere can be viewed like an engine: one that works to make cars, roads, clothes, and stuff – even people – using available energy. The technosphere still has access to abundant supplies of high energy density fossil fuels. And so the absolute decoupling of global carbon emissions from economic growth will not happen until they either run out or the technosphere eventually transitions to alternative energy generation. That may be well beyond the danger zone for humans.  We have just come to appreciate that our impacts on the Earth system are so large that we have possibly ushered in a new geological epoch: the Anthropocene. The Earth’s rocks will bear witness to humans’ impacts long after we disappear. The technosphere can be seen as the engine of the Anthropocene. But that does not mean we are driving it. We may have created this system, but it is not built for our communal benefit. This runs completely counter to how we view our relationship with the Earth system. Take the planetary boundaries concept, which has generated much interest scientifically, economically, and politically. This idea frames human development as impacting on nine planetary boundaries, including climate change, biodiversity loss, and ocean acidification. If we push past these boundaries, then the Earth system will change in ways that will make human civilisation very difficult, if not impossible, to maintain. The value of, say, the biosphere here is that it provides goods and services to us. This represents what we can literally get from the system. This very human-centric approach should lead to more sustainable development. It should constrain growth. But the technological world system we have built is clever at getting around such constraints. It uses the ingenuity of humans to build new technologies – such as geoengineering – to reduce surface temperatures. That would not halt ocean acidification and so would lead to the potential collapse of ocean ecosystems. No matter. The climate constraint would have been avoided and the technosphere could then get to work overcoming any side effects of biodiversity loss. Fish stocks collapse? Shift to farmed fish or intensively grown algae. As defined so far, there appears nothing to stop the technosphere liquidating most of the Earth’s biosphere to satisfy its growth. Just as long as goods and services are consumed, the technosphere can continue to grow. And so those who fear the collapse of civilisation or those who have enduring faith in human innovation being able to solve all sustainability challenges may both be wrong.  After all, a much smaller and much richer population of the order of hundreds of millions could consume more than the current population of 7.6 billion or the projected population of nine billion by the middle of this century. While there would be widespread disruption, the technosphere may be able to weather climate change beyond 3°C. It does not care, cannot care, that billions of people would have died.  And at some point in the future, the technosphere could even function without humans. We worry about robots taking over human’s jobs. Perhaps we should be more concerned with them taking over our role as apex consumers. The situation, then, may all seem rather hopeless. Whether or not my argument is an accurate representation of our civilisation, there is the risk it produces a self-fulfilling prophecy. Because if we believe we can’t slow down the growth of the technosphere, then why bother?  This goes beyond the question of “what difference could I make?” to “what difference can anyone make?” While flying less, cutting down on eating meat and dairy and cycling to work are all commendable steps to take, they do not constitute living outside the technosphere. It’s not just that we give tacit consent to the technosphere by using its roads, computers, or intensively farmed food. It’s that by being a productive member of society, by earning and spending, above all by consuming, we further the technosphere’s growth.

      Climate change: yes, your individual action does make a difference


 Perhaps the way out from fatalism and disaster is an acceptance that humans may not actually be in control of our planet. This would be the vital first step that could lead to a broader outlook that encompasses more than humans.  For example, the mainstream economic attitude about trees, frogs, mountains, and lakes is that these things only have value if they provide something to us. This mindset sets them up as nothing more than resources to exploit and sinks for waste.  What if we thought of them as components or even our companions in the complex Earth system? Questions about sustainable development then become questions about how growth in the technosphere can be accommodated with their concerns, interests, and welfare as well as ours. This may produce questions that seem absurd. What are the concerns or interests of a mountain? Of a flea? But if we continue to frame the situation in terms of “us against them”, of human well-being trumping everything else in the Earth system, then we may be effectively hacking away the best form of protection against a dangerously rampant technosphere.  And so the most effective guard against climate breakdown may not be technological solutions, but a more fundamental reimagining of what constitutes a good life on this particular planet. We may be critically constrained in our abilities to change and rework the technosphere, but we should be free to envisage alternative futures. So far our response to the challenge of climate change exposes a fundamental failure of our collective imagination.  To understand you are in a prison, you must first be able to see the bars. That this prison was created by humans over many generations doesn’t change the conclusion that we are currently tightly bound up within a system that could, if we do not act, lead to the impoverishment, and even death of billions of people. Eight years ago, I woke up to the real possibility that humanity is facing disaster. I can still smell that bad coffee, I can still recall the memory of scrabbling to make sense of the words I was hearing. Embracing the reality of the technosphere doesn’t mean giving up, of meekly returning to our cells. It means grabbing a vital new piece of the map and planning our escape.

"The UK’s efforts to cut greenhouse gases are being undermined by a failure to put in place climate policies that cover imported goods, research has found. The government is committed to cutting the UK’s carbon output to net zero by 2050, and emissions have been falling for the past three decades. But that does not take into account the “invisible” side of Britain’s carbon footprint, which comes from international travel and the carbon produced overseas to make goods that are used here.  About half of Britain’s true carbon footprint is made up of these sources, according to a report from the conservation charity WWF. Emissions associated with imports to the UK, including international travel, have risen from about 316m tonnes of carbon in 1990 to 360m tonnes in 2016 and 358m tonnes in 2017, the latest year for which data is available. These imported emissions can vary substantially from year to year, but have been broadly steady or rising, though they are down from a peak of 449m in 2007, before the financial crisis. Over the same period, between 1990 and 2016, the UK’s own carbon emissions fell by more than 40%, thanks mainly to a long switch away from coal-fired power to gas and renewable sources of electricity, according to the report published on Thursday. The carbon associated with the manufacture of imported goods appears in the carbon accounts of the manufacturing country. However, some countries have less stringent carbon targets than others, and developing countries may struggle to use low-carbon methods as they pursue economic growth. International aviation is not covered by countries’ national carbon targets, under the UN climate talks and the Paris agreement. “If all other countries were going for net zero too, then this [invisible carbon footprint] wouldn’t be a problem,” said the author of the report, John Barrett, a professor of energy and climate policy at the University of Leeds. “The UK should be showing leadership.” Policies to ensure that goods allowed to be imported had a lower carbon footprint – such as requirements on the efficiency, repairability and recycling of electric and electronic goods – could have a major impact on the invisible side of Britain’s carbon footprint, he added. Exporters would have an incentive to reduce their carbon footprint and the emissions associated with using their goods. Other changes to people’s habits could also bear fruit, for instance, encouraging a move to a healthier diet with more vegetables and less meat could change food imports and the carbon associated with them, said Barrett. The question of how to account for the emissions associated with imports is a vexed and polarising one, with some green campaigners arguing that developed countries should accept responsibility for emissions generated overseas, while other economists point out that the manufacturing countries have been paid for the goods. Josh Burke, a policy fellow at the Grantham research institute on climate change at the London School of Economics, who was not involved in the report, said: “Using consumption accounting to understand trade flows is a useful exercise in light of the current global disruptions to supply chains and geopolitical tensions that have seen trade walls erected. Policies to shift consumption patterns and lower imports emissions – such as border carbon adjustments – are an elegant economic solution, based on equity and efficiency, rather than protectionism.” The EU is considering such border adjustments – in effect, carbon taxes on imports – to take into account the carbon generated by their manufacture, as part of its European green deal. But this is complex, said Burke. Such policies “tend to get bogged down in the politics of implementation and discussions often get sucked backed into protectionist agendas. As the UK begins to negotiate a raft of new free trade agreements, the optics of such a policy may in fact hinder international cooperation.” The UK will host the next UN climate talks, originally set for November in Glasgow but delayed to next year by the coronavirus crisis. This gives ministers the opportunity to encourage other countries to bring forward strong plans on curbing greenhouse gas emissions, and to offer assistance to poor countries that could benefit by building their low-carbon export sectors, according to Stephen Cornelius, the chief climate adviser at WWF. “We should not be avoiding imports, but we should help other countries to reduce their carbon intensity,” he said. “The UK should work with other countries to bring forward high-ambition plans” under the Paris agreement. Barrett warned that ministers could be tempted, in drawing up plans for the economy to recover from the virus crisis, to pursue trade deals at any cost, without regard to their environmental impacts. “We have the option to improve standards, to encourage a low-carbon economy, or a race to the bottom,” he said. “That would undermine our environmental and social capital.” The UK’s domestic emissions fall under the Climate Change Act, under which the government must meet carbon budgets set out by the independent Committee on Climate Change several years in advance. The CCC has recommended that the UK continue to base its commitments on its “territorial” emissions, as this is the agreed international practice, but also keep track of emissions based on the consumption of goods from overseas and the implications of that trade."
"Britain’s energy-hungry population is highly dependent on oil and gas, which powers around two thirds of the UK’s energy needs. The Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) projects that by 2030, this proportion will not have changed much. But the source of that oil and gas is changing, and changing fast. In 2005, the UK was self-sufficient in both oil and gas, but now imports about one third of both. With North Sea production in steady decline, dependency on overseas suppliers is increasing: by 2020, three quarters of gas will be imported, mainly from Norway and Qatar. It is sobering that the journey from self-sufficiency to dependence on overseas suppliers will have taken the UK only 15 years, barely the time it takes to school the country’s citizens. The recent discovery and commercial exploitation of shale gas reserves has changed the petroleum landscape – at least, in the US. Over just the last twenty years, a blink of a geological eyelid, horizontal drilling combined with hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”) of shale rocks underground has transformed the US petroleum landscape. In 2010 the US became a net exporter of petroleum products for the first time since World War II, with shale gas and oil contributing around US$100 billion per year to the US economy. Currently, the US is expanding its gas liquefaction facilities so that it can export more as liquid natural gas (LNG) to lucrative European and Asian markets. This is the backdrop to the two recent reports by the British Geological Survey (BGS) which give initial estimates of the amounts of shale oil in the Weald of southern England and shale gas in the Bowland shales of northern England. The Weald study covers parts of Kent, Sussex, Surrey and Hampshire, from where small amounts of conventional oil have been produced for decades. The BGS estimated that there might be between 2.2-8.5 billion barrels of oil in place, with a central estimate of 4.4 billion barrels. A much more important question is how many of those 4.4 billion barrels might be recoverable. Experience from the US suggests that only 5% of the oil may be recoverable, even where the geology works well. But the Weald is not like the US best case scenario. Most of the rocks are richer in clay, which makes them difficult to frack effectively. They are also more highly faulted, which makes the geology more complicated. And most of the oil targeted in the US is very light, and so flows quite easily. In contrast, oil in the Weald is likely to be heavier, more viscous, and harder to extract. Since neither the rock nor the oil is of optimal quality in the Weald, we might estimate that only 1-2% might be recoverable. This would equate to 0.05-0.1 billion barrels, enough to meet just a few months of Britain’s energy demand. With 40 billion barrels already produced from the North Sea and another 20 billion still to come, the onshore prize seems very small. The gas story shows rather more promise, although we need more data before the true potential is understood. The BGS’s central estimate for total gas within the upper Bowland Shale, the most prospective unit, is 260 trillion cubic feet (tcf). If gas recovery rates are closer to 15%, as early US data suggest , the 39 tcf equates to 13 years of UK gas consumption – a more worthy prize. However, recovery of these volumes of gas rests on the very unlikely assumptions that all areas of the Bowland are as equally gas-rich and easily accessible for drilling. And it would require a huge escalation of onshore drilling. Production data over the past decade from the Barnett Shale in Texas suggests that an average of 1 billion cubic feet is produced from each well. Production of the full 39 tcf would thus require around 30,000 wells, unless average recovery rates can be improved. The industry’s ability to drill up to ten wells from a single site means that 3,000 sites would need to be scattered around the north of England. In comparison, the UK has drilled around 20 onshore oil and gas wells per year over the last century. Unlike the rest of Europe, the UK government has stated that it is determined to “go all out for shale”, with a package including tax incentives, changes to the trespass laws and financial benefits for local communities. But the required level of drilling can only occur if the legitimate worries of local communities are met. This will require strong and effective government regulation, together with an open and meaningful dialogue between industry and the communities in which it hopes to operate."

It never ceases to amaze me that a country economy dependent on growing things — be it via arboriculture, agriculture, apiculture, aquaculture, aviculture, citriculture, floriculture, horticulture, mariculture, pisciculture, silviculture, viticulture or simply the scenery that brings tourists to our Great Walks etc — would want to deprive all this of its feedstock. Talk about biting the hand that feeds you. 



Two posts caught the eye. First:



The Crowther Lab at ETH Zurich investigates **nature-based solutions to climate change**. In their latest study the researchers showed for the first time where in the world new trees could grow and how much carbon they would store. Study lead author and postdoc at the Crowther Lab Jean-François Bastin explains: “One aspect was of particular importance to us as we did the calculations: we excluded cities or agricultural areas from the total restoration potential as these areas are needed for human life.”



The researchers calculated that under the current climate conditions, Earth’s land could support 4.4 billion hectares of continuous tree cover. That is 1.6 billion more than the currently existing 2.8 billion hectares. Of these 1.6 billion hectares, 0.9 billion hectares fulfill the criterion of not being used by humans. **This means that there is currently an area of the size of the US available for tree restoration.** Once mature, these new forests could store 205 billion tonnes of carbon: about two thirds of the 300 billion tonnes of carbon that has been released into the atmosphere as a result of human activity since the Industrial Revolution. […]



Plant an area the size of the US to eat up the CO2. Simple! Jones is on to that already.



But wait … steak knives at the ready! A day later this appeared:



Amid all the talk of an imminent planetary catastrophe caused by emissions of carbon dioxide, another fact is often ignored: **global greening is happening faster than climate change.** The amount of vegetation growing on the earth has been increasing every year for at least 30 years. **The evidence comes from the growth rate of plants and from satellite data**.



In 2016 a paper was published by 32 authors from 24 institutions in eight countries that analysed satellite data and concluded that there had been a roughly **14% increase in green vegetation over 30 years**. The study attributed **70% of this increase to the extra carbon dioxide** in the atmosphere. The lead author on the study, Zaichun Zhu of Beijing University, says **this is equivalent to adding a new continent of green vegetation twice the size of the mainland United States.**



Global greening has affected all ecosystems – from arctic tundra to coral reefs to plankton to tropical rain forests – but shows up most strongly in arid places like the Sahel region of Africa, where **desertification has largely now reversed**. This is because plants lose less water in the process of absorbing carbon dioxide if the concentration of carbon dioxide is higher. Ecosystems and **farms will be less water-stressed** at the end of this century than they are today during periods of low rainfall.



There should have been no surprise about this news. Thousands of experiments have been conducted over many years in which levels of CO2 had been increased over crops or wild ecosystems and boosted their growth. The owners of commercial greenhouses usually pump CO2 into the air to speed up the growth of plants. **CO2 is plant food.**



 **This greening is good news. It means more food for insects and deer, for elephants and mice, for fish and whales. It means higher yields for farmers; indeed, the effect has probably added about $3 trillion to farm incomes over the last 30 years. So less land is needed to feed the human population and more can be spared for wildlife instead.**



  
The Greens and eco-nuts should be dancing with joy, turning cart-wheels down Queen St and along Lambton Quay. **It is GOOD NEWS!** More food, happier turtles and whales, less water-intensive farming etc …



What’s that? Oh, sorry … apparently we have a climate emergency.

"Veganism is arguably the biggest food trend of the moment. This has led to a massive expansion of meat-free brands and own-label offerings. In fact, the UK is now the nation with the highest number of vegan food products launched. And with major news outlets such as The Economist and Forbes declaring 2019 the “year of the vegan”, the trend promises to continue – a third of people in the UK have already stopped or reduced eating meat.  Long-established brands tend to receive great publicity for reformulating their products to be vegan and newly launched meat-free products prove to be incredibly popular and fast selling. This is great news, considering that a decrease in animal product consumption constitutes the “single biggest way” to respond to environmental challenges such as the climate crisis, soil degradation and biodiversity loss.  Providing only 37% of our protein and 18% of our calories, meat, aquaculture, eggs, and dairy use 83% of the world’s farmland and make up 57% of all food emissions. A shift from animal to plant-based food production would help to reduce UK greenhouse gas emissions. It would also help to tackle some of the major health issues facing society, while still meeting protein and calorie requirements.   But despite this trend for plant-based food, not all meat-free innovations sold in the shops are free from ingredients of animal origin. While “vegan” implies that products are fully plant-based and free from animal produce, “meat-free” or “vegetarian” products may still contain milk, dairy or other animal-based ingredients.  Alongside the emergence of plant-based newcomer brands, in recent years, established meat-alternative companies such as the meat-free giant Quorn and the traditionally vegetarian brand Linda McCartney have started to reformulate their products to offer a bigger range of vegan options. But many other producers of “meat alternatives” still rely on animal-based substances such as eggs and dairy. That said, many established and new product ranges that are labelled and promoted as vegetarian are, in fact, vegan, so what’s going on here? It may well be that manufacturers still hesitate to market their products in the vegan category – vegetarian feels like a safer alternative. Indeed, it’s estimated that 92% of plant-based meals were eaten by non-vegans in 2018. Vegans make up only a small minority of consumers buying meat-free meals.  But it seems that when it comes to what people actually want to buy, vegan products are in high demand. Nestle’s meat-free range, which was meant to “revolutionise the vegetarian category”, was withdrawn from British supermarket shelves after just a few months. Also, Linda McCartney’s pizzas topped with “fake-meat” alongside dairy-based cheese proved unsuccessful. Looking at the numbers, the production of dairy and eggs might not be as harmful as the production of meat, but it still has a significant impact on the environment. And more importantly, it is built on the same unsustainable farming practices as meat production. It’s not just products marketed as meat-free that might contain ingredients of animal origin either. In the demand for more wellness products, recent innovations have led to a number of items using by-products of animal origin. These may be milk powder or fat, but can also be products or by-products of slaughter – such as animal fats, rennet or collagen. Marks and Spencer, for example, sells a “Super Water” which uses beef collagen to boost protein content – much to the outcry of shoppers. So given the severe impact animal-based food production has on the environment, and the trend for vegan products, wouldn’t it make sense for all new vegetarian product ranges simply be made vegan?  Traditional vegetarianism rejects meat as unethical for taking the life of an animal, whereas eggs and dairy are seen as staples and essentials for good health. This understanding goes back to the post-World War II context when factory farming was still in its infancy and milk surpluses were pushed through public health and school milk campaigns. But in today’s age of factory farming, meat and dairy are two sides of the same coin.  Even if vegans currently only make up 3% of the UK population, there is a clear consumer push for plant-based produce. Awareness of the environmental and ethical impacts of our food system is growing and “veganism” provides a context to view the problem in its entirety. Shoppers are also keen to vary their proteins and explore plant-based milks. Vegetarians are comfortable with vegan products and products such as meat-free sausages – and crisps or chocolate chip cookies work without milk and eggs as additives.  So with the food industry continuously innovating in this market, it would make more sense for the label “vegetarian” to become redundant and to be instead replaced by “vegan”. This is important because a “vegan” approach goes beyond the environmental aspects to shed light on factory farming and how it is not just cruel, but a threat to all life on the planet. And in this sense vegetarian product launches and meat-free product innovations that rely on animal-derived substances are quite clearly a step backwards."

Share this...FacebookTwitterI’m short on time this week, but Benny Peiser brings our attention to the latest energy revolution: coal!
I guess CO2 can’t be that great of a problem after all. At the Christian Science Monitor:
While regulation limits coal power in the US, Hunt writes that the energy source is on the rise in Europe.
A funny thing is happening on the way to the clean energy future.  While the US government wages a regulatory war on coal fired generation, in Europe, the land of the oh so politically correct the drive for greenhouse gas emissions reduction is meeting a new competitor—reality!
The EU emissions trading scheme had fallen on hard times […] it was not the transformation some had hoped to achieve.
Then the Japan earthquake and tsunami sends Europe into a frenzy over the safety of nuclear power and Germany announced major closures of its nuclear fleet.  The Greens hoped killing off nuclear would give them a two-fer—less nuke and more renewables.
The German government policy is to encourage construction of 10 gigawatts of coal fired generation to displace aging nuclear plants and provide baseload backup for wind and solar power.  Worldwide coal plant construction grew 5.4% over the past year according to BP and now represents about 30% of installed capacity. …

"**A Welsh railway immortalised by Thomas The Tank Engine's creator ""would get more generous Covid financial help if it was in England"", its boss has said.**
The Talyllyn Railway, where The Rev W Awdry volunteered, is one of Wales' ""iconic"" narrow gauge heritage lines that have been ""battered"" by Covid-19.
Passenger numbers and revenue has been hit and Welsh railways say lines in England have had more government help.
The Welsh Government has said Â£715,000 has gone to help historic railways.
Narrow gauge lines are synonymous with Wales and are among the most renowned in the world, attracting an estimated one million visitors a year to Wales and boosting the Welsh economy Â£55m annually.
Now all 11 Welsh historic railways would normally be full steam ahead for one of their busiest periods pre-Christmas.
But Santa specials and turkey and tinsel events have, by and large, been scuppered by the Covid-19 crisis as only two of 11 railways that make up the Great Little Trains of Wales organisation are putting on special events over the festive period, although some may still run restricted services.
It's a ""microcosm of a horrendous year"" which has seen some railways make people redundant and furlough most of their staff - while the hundreds of seasonal workers on those famous old lines haven't been needed.
Railways have been ""propped up"" by online donations, lottery grants or government help - but Welsh operators are frustrated as they say English railways can get more from the latest financial support than those in Wales.
Railways in England could apply for Â£1m as part of the UK Government's Â£1.57bn Cultural Recovery Fund, while some lines had almost Â£2m with extra arts assistance.
Operators in Wales say they could only bid for Â£150,000 in Welsh Government support although the government said the application process ""welcomed funding requests of up to Â£500,000.
The Talyllyn Railway in Gwynedd, where Thomas' creator The Rev W Awdry was a volunteer guard when it opened as the world's first preserved railway in 1951, was ""extremely grateful"" for its Â£150,000 government grant.
But after losing Â£670,000 or 60% of their year-on-year revenue, Talyllyn's general manager Stuart Williams said: ""I feel we would have got more generous Covid financial help if we were in England.
""This year has been a huge challenge. We raised Â£130,000 on virtual visits when we were shut and without that, we'd have been in trouble,"" added the vice-chairman of the Great Little Trains of Wales group.
About 50 miles north of the Talyllyn is one of Europe's biggest small railways whose revenue has nosedived from Â£6m to Â£1m as visitor numbers have tumbled from 220,00 to 30,000.
The Ffestiniog Railway - the world's first passenger-carrying narrow gauge railway - and its sister Welsh Highland Railway have this week made a third of their 97 staff redundant as their ""very painful"" year continues, with a warning they may be forced to close without further help.
The company which runs the two north Wales lines are yet to receive their Â£150,000 grant but their general manager says the amount ""pales to insignificance compared with the problem having lost Â£5m worth of income"".
""We can save costs but we need Â£2m worth of funding to keep on top of the game so we can open ready to go at Easter 2021,"" said boss Paul Lewin.
""If you go over the border to England and see Department for Culture, Media and Sport have funded the North Yorkshire Railway to the tune of Â£1.94m and Â£900,000 to the Severn Valley Railway.
""If we were a different size business to them, I could understand but we're not - we're the largest heritage railway in the country and North Yorks and Severn Valley are both Â£6m-Â£7m turnover companies like ourselves - and they have been supported and will carry on.
""We've just had a little bit of help which we are grateful for but now we've had to make 32 people redundant, on top of about 50 seasonal posts.
""That's 80 people that have been affected and we're trying to survive through winter with a minimal workforce and eek cash out long enough to run next year.""

""The Ffestiniog Railway is an incredible survivor and looks like it did 150 years ago. This is a living piece of Welsh heritage we're preserving for the nation, not by grants but by paying its own way as being a tourist attraction.
""We're not some flash in the pan tourist attraction, we've been a very important staple for 60 years, bringing income, jobs and tourists to the area - and I think that warrants some respect and attention and wouldn't it be a shame something that has delivered so much is overlooked.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe dead silence we’ve seen on the climate issue during the 2012 Presidential campaign is getting a strong reaction in Germany. Today I’m presenting 2 short views on this. One from a German skeptic, and one from a devout treehugger/climate crisis believer.
Ulli Kulke of DIE WELT
At his DIE WELT site, veteran journalist Ulli Kulke writes a piece titled: Al Gore is used up. In it he states that climate change as an issue is rapidly losing importance internationally.
Al Gore tweeted and tweeted last Monday evening, but it didn’t help. His agitated electronic pulses went unheard in the last TV debate…”
Not only is the issue completely off the radar in the United States, Kulke tells us, it is also now being increasingly challenged in Great Britain, and even the Germans are losing their angst of climate change.
Excerpts of what Kulke writes:
The complete absence of attention to climate change is new in the recent history in the USA since 1988, when James Hansen, Director of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) of NASA sounded the huge alarms in Congress and thus drew prestige, attention and state funding.
The air is gone from the issue because of the never-ending signals of the coming end of the world […] are no longer of any interest for voters.
Alarmism internationally, at least for now, appears to have been braked. Also here the German Academy of Technical Sciences (Acatech) recently presented a position paper on the topic. Its tenor: Climate change would not pose a problem that could not be handled by us. Just a few years ago that would have been an unthinkable statement.”

In summary in Kulke’s view, climate change has become a tiresome broken record among the public and people are far more concerned about jobs, the economy and the financial crisis.
Arne Jungjohann blames the silence on coal-state Ohio
Devout treehugger (and ally of US leftists) Arne Jungjohann at his alarmist website “Climate of Justice is upset about the silence over climate change during this campaign and presents a very plausible explanation.
Just 4 years ago, Obama was presenting himself as a huge proponent of renewable energies and promised to wean the USA off coal. Jungjohann poses and answers the question:
So why is there suddenly all this dead silence on the issue of climate change this election campaign?
Climate change as an issue is silent because it is not on the agenda in swing states. The election is not decided in New York or California, rather it is decided in states like Colorado and Ohio. Because of the particularities of the election system, Ohio has a high chance of tipping the scales. And Ohio gets 78% of its electric power from coal – That’s why Obama is now trying to appear as the better coal politician.”
We all know the Obama will say anything to get elected. So now is a good time to remind voters once more where Obama really stands on the issue:

“Under my plan, electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket.” Hardly what Ohio voters want to hear.
This year Obama can’t afford to be honest about it.

"A new report from the Committee on Climate Change has outlined how the UK should – and could – reduce its carbon emissions to net zero by 2050. While an ambitious target in itself, the commission predicts Scotland can meet it a little earlier, by 2045, while England will hit the target on time. Wales, however, has only been set a goal of 95% reduction by 2050. Coming just days after Wales declared a climate emergency, the reduced goal has been met with understanding from the Welsh government – but why is it that the committee believes Wales cannot meet net zero? With wind power now cheaper than fossil fuel sources, polluting coal and gas fired power stations will not be replaced in Wales, meaning that the electricity sector should be relatively straightforward to decarbonise.  However, the accompanying analysis notes that Wales has relatively little capacity for carbon capture and storage, to take carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and trap it underground. Progress in other areas has been slow too. The report states that less than 5% of the energy used for heating buildings comes from low-carbon sources across the UK, and less than 0.5% of the miles driven are in low-carbon vehicles. But the reduced target is not because of these areas alone – it is mainly due to the fact that the agricultural industry will be difficult to decarbonise.  Some 90% of the land in Wales is in the hands of
“farmers, foresters or other stewards of the landscape”. Climate, soil quality and landscape make the country relatively unsuited to arable agriculture, so the industry is dominated by cattle and sheep, which produce the potent greenhouse gas methane as part of their digestive process.

 From a farmer’s perspective, it might seem that agriculture is being asked to shoulder a large burden of emission reductions compared to other sectors. But looking at the detail, the report suggests almost the opposite. It recognises that agriculture is particularly hard to decarbonise but, the problem is that given the measures proposed for other sectors, the committee’s figures show agriculture will go from its current position as one of the UK’s lower emission sectors to a major emitter by 2050.  Livestock farming is the lifeblood of the rural economy in Wales, with enormous cultural and historical significance. The economic collapse that followed the closure of coal mines in the South Wales valleys is a lesson in how not to change the status quo. Unemployment is still high in this area decades afterwards. The question then is how Welsh farming can respond to changes in consumer demand and climate change without damaging the economy.

      Carbon farming: how agriculture can both feed people and fight climate change


 The committee’s recommendations include a reduction of between 20% and 50% in beef, lamb and dairy consumption. It notes that even this target would still mean we will be eating more of these foods than recommended in healthy eating guidelines. In order for these dietary shifts to reduce emissions in practice, farmers will need to produce less livestock rather than simply export any excess. This means that redesigning agricultural support payments will be an essential component of any change. Work by our colleagues in Aberystwyth has led to incremental improvements in the efficiency of ruminant agriculture via grassland improvement and animal breeding. For example, reseeding pasture with high sugar grass increases milk production in dairy cattle and weight gain in both beef and sheep, and reduces negative environmental impacts. These grass varieties now account for almost a third of perennial rye grass seed sales across Wales, as farmers improve their land.  However, livestock efficiency gains alone are unlikely to be sufficient, so by 2050 Wales will need to be farming differently. The committee’s report suggests that a fifth of agricultural land will need to be used for other purposes, such as growing bioenergy crops, which can be burned to generate electricity, and forestry that can sequester carbon.

      Agroforestry can help the UK meet climate change commitments without cutting livestock numbers


 The day-to-day practicalities of farming for carbon are not the same as farming for food, but turning over 20% of a farm to a different purpose does not need to spell the end of a culture or a way of life. By 2050 Wales can have a bio-economy, one based on natural resources rather than fossil fuels. Other industries that are reliant on fossil fuels will also need to change; plastics can already be made from plants instead of oil, and the construction industry is increasingly turning to timber engineering to reduce its reliance on concrete. These changes will create demand for plant feedstocks that Welsh farmers will be well placed to provide.  Reaching the 95% emission target by 2050 is ambitious but achievable. For Wales to reach net zero, sacrifices will need to be made, both by industry and the public. As a nation, Wales is blessed with natural resources — they are not in short supply. Farmers are key to realising this opportunity. While the recent history of Wales was built on coal, its future will be built on the bio-economy.

WashPost: Freedom of Information Act not for skeptics’ use
by Steve Milloy
In a bizarre Memorial Day editorial, the Washington Post criticized climate skeptics for using the Freedom of Information Act to pry documents concerning Climategater Michael Mann from the University of Virginia.
The Post labeled the skeptics’ FOIA efforts as “harrassing” and “nuisance tactics.”

The Post, however, has been entirely silent on Greenpeace’s efforts to FOIA documents from the University of Virginia concerning Pat Michaels, University of Delaware concerning David Legates and from Harvard University concerning Willie Soon and Sallie Baliunas — efforts that are truly “harrassing” and “nuisance” in nature as Greenpeace acted entirely in retaliation to the FOIA request concerning Mann.
The editorial is especially gross coming on the day when America commemorates those who died to preserve everyone’s freedoms — not just those of the politically correct.
==============================================================
And I’ll add the post has been entirely silent on the fact the George Mason University, when asked by USA Today reporter Dan Vergano to produce documents related to the whole vindictive DeepClimate (Dave Clarke) and John Mashey assault on Wegman and Said at GMU. Vergano asked for “expedited service” and requests that “fees be waived”.
Not only did GMU comply, they did so quickly, without complaint, waived fees, and provided everything on a USB flash drive they sent to USA Today’s Vergano.
That is the starkest contrast to the whining , wailing, and gnashing of teeth surrounding the FOIA requests for other universities like UEA and UVA . It vividly illustrates the elitism and bigotry of the organizations and the people who believe themselves to be above the law as well as the organizations who fan the flames by coming to their defense citing “academic freedom”. Bottom line – use of public money makes the process and results open to public scrutiny to all who request the information, no matter who they are. Don’t like the scrutiny? Then don’t take the public money.
Steve McIntyre writes:
The difference in how academic institutions have responded to the seemingly similar requests in respect to Wegman and Mann is quite startling. George Mason gave expedited service to a request for Wegman’s emails; the U of Virginia has done the opposite. George Mason turned over Wegman’s correspondence with an academic journal without litigation; the University of Virginia has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on litigation. Multiple academic lobby groups protested the production of Mann’s emails as a matter of principle; the same organizations were and remain silent in respect to Wegman.
What is doubly bizarre is that apparently this FOIA request has led to the discovery that Dr. Ray Bradley, Mann co-author with the hockey stick paper “MBH98”, apparently committed academic misconduct in his zeal to smear Wegman.
From Climate Audit:
…the README included by George Mason stated the “documents may not be forwarded to a third party”. It also included the GMU policy on academic misconduct, stating Bradley had violated the confidentiality terms – a point not reported by USA Today:
The materials in this USB are being provided in compliance with the Virginia FOIA. Many of the documents are published research papers that are copyrighted by their respective publishers. All other documents are copyrighted by Edward J. Wegman and Yasmin H. Said or by their respective authors. All rights are reserved. These documents may not be forwarded to a third party. Also included in this USB is the George Mason University policy document 4007 on academic misconduct. This policy requires confidentiality for all parties including complainants, in this case Professor Raymond Bradley. This confidentiality requirement was violated by Professor Bradley.
Also, last week, I sent an email to WaPo’s ombudsman, requesting space to rebut Bill McKibben’s senseless bloviation about tornadoes and climate change. No response.
In light of their non-acknowledgement of a similar process by Greenpeace using FOIA laws to get records on climate skeptics Michaels, Legates, Soon, and Baliunas, plus their non-acknowledgement of my request, WaPo’s editorial gist comes across like this:
One rule of use for AGW proponents, another for skeptics.
To me, it smacks of this sort of ugly thinking.

 **Introduction**



During the past six months governments have intervened massively in the financial and real sectors of their economies, reviving debate over policies long considered vanquished. Some governments have turned to protectionism, raising tariffs and other barriers to trade. Others are subsidizing industries or more quietly finessing regulatory policies to advantage domestic “champions.” Surely, the temptation to placate powerful domestic interests will lead other governments toward protectionism in the months ahead.



A sense of foreboding seems to have enveloped the trade policy community, where a common view among scholars, economists, and journalists is that a resurgence of protectionism is inevitable, and that it will cause serious economic damage. In the newspaper columns and in the think tank reports, there is little evidence of any faith that the rules‐​based system of trade‐​established in part for the purpose of containing and defusing protectionist outbursts‐​is equipped to rise to what is arguably the first major challenge in its 62‐​year existence.



But that view does not adequately reflect the fact that most governments prefer policies that keep their economies open to trade and investment. Despite some episodes of backsliding, the world is unlikely to witness a significant departure from the trend toward trade and investment liberalization that has been evident since the end of World War II. An increasing number of governments have come to recognize that optimal economic outcomes arise under conditions where policies enhance‐​rather than limit‐​the freedom of people to transact with others, including foreigners. Protectionism limits choices and thereby undermines human liberty and economic efficiency.



Reasonably well‐​respected trade rules and the reality of a global economic system that renders trade openness an imperative for success are some of the reasons to believe that any protectionist outbreak will be fleeting. Indeed, policymakers would be advised to respond to the downturn _by_ reducing their trade and investment barriers unilaterally because doing so expands choices, reduces costs, and spurs the kinds of structural reforms that facilitate economic growth.



 **A System to Bend but Not Break**



One of the reasons for the creation of the rules‐​based system of trade was to ensure that the scenario of spiraling, retaliatory protectionism of the 1930s never played out again. Starting with the General Agreement on Tariffs an Trade in 1947, through seven subsequent multilateral rounds of trade liberalization culminating in the establishment of the World Trade Organization in 1995, and into the present, that objective has been upheld.



The WTO/GATT rules encourage trade liberalization, but also grant governments some flexibility to manage their own paces of liberalization and to re‐​impose or raise barriers under certain circumstances. The rules distinguish between “Bound” and “Applied” tariff rates. The bound rate is the maximum rate of duty (per product category) that a member can assess against imports, and the applied rate is the prevailing rate of duty (per product category). Generally, the bound rates of developed countries are significantly lower than the bound rates of developing countries. That is, the highest allowable tariffs in richer countries are much lower than the highest allowable tariffs in poorer countries.1



Within the rules, developing country economies are considered more vulnerable to potentially disruptive effects of rapid changes brought about by increased trade and investment. Accordingly, governments of developing countries are afforded greater latitude to respond to those changes. How much latitude depends, to some extent, on the differences between each country’s bound and applied rates. If the applied rate relative to the bound rate is low, then there may be vast room for backsliding and raising tariffs in response to a perceived crisis. For many developing countries, the differences are vast.



India’s simple average bound tariff rate is 50.2 percent, but its simple average applied rate is 14.5 percent. Thus, the Indian government could almost quadruple its tariffs without violating its WTO obligations. Likewise, Brazil has a lot of “overhang” with an average bound rate of 31.4 percent and an average applied rate of 12.2 percent. By contrast, China has far less latitude for backsliding. Its average bound rate is 10.0 percent, and its average applied rate is 9.9 percent. The institutional restraint on China’s backsliding is similar to that on developed countries. The bound and applied rates of the United States are both 3.5 percent, and for the European Union (27) the bound rate is 5.4 percent and the applied is 5.2 percent.2 Many factors affect a member’s bound rates, including its level of development, its duration as a member of the WTO/GATT, and its past negotiating positions, to name a few.3



Other forms of temporary backsliding also are permitted within the system. Members can raise tariffs in excess of their bound rates, impose quotas, and even ban imports altogether under various WTO agreements. The Agreement on Safeguards permits members to impose duties or quotas in response to unforeseen import surges, which seriously injure a domestic industry. Under the Anti‐​dumping Agreement, duties can be imposed when a domestic industry is materially injured by reason of imports that have been sold at prices below “normal value.“4 The Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures permits members to impose duties to offset the injurious effects on a domestic industry from imports that benefit from foreign government subsidies.



Under the rules, imports also can be banned in the interest of public health or safety. Some member countries have used these provisions to exclude imports of beef that were suspected of contamination from “mad cow” disease. Others have banned genetically modified agricultural products on the grounds that the risks of consumption are presently unknown.



 **Protectionism on the Rise?**



C. Fred Bergsten of the Peterson Institute for International Economics finds that “The WTO rules are very porous. If you simply say live up to your rules, you still have massive scope for what I call legal protectionism.“5 But Bergsten sees the glass as half empty. Sure, there is scope for backsliding, but without that scope in the first place the WTO/GATT system likely never would have come to succeed as it has. Governments would have been less willing to formalize commitments and the scope of rules coverage would have been smaller in terms of products and countries involved.



Still even more importantly, the trade rules are not so restrictive that governments obsess over finding ways around them. It is not the existence of the rules that compels countries to liberalize trade. Governments typically are not looking for excuses to raise trade barriers. If compliance were the primary motivation for countries to liberalize trade, we would not observe applied tariff rates that are so much lower than the maximum allowable rates. And we would likely observe much greater use of the various trade remedies across industries and more invocation of restrictions in the name of health and other technical barriers to trade.



Trade liberalization is motivated by self‐​interest, and the disparities between bound and applied rates are explained by the fact that most members have a preference for openness. There are real benefits, beyond the reciprocal openings of others’ markets, to keeping one’s own trade barriers low. Nevertheless, governments have been invoking protectionist measures over the past several months. Here are just a few examples:6



And here is how a top‐​circulation American daily newspaper described the global flirtation with trade barriers in December:



Moving to _shield battered_ domestic manufacturers from foreign imports, Indonesia is _slapping_ restrictions on at least 500 products this month, demanding special licenses and new fees on imports. Russia is hiking tariffs on imported cars, poultry and pork. France is launching a state fund to protect French companies from foreign takeovers. Officials in Argentina and Brazil are seeking to raise tariffs on products from imported wine and textiles to leather goods and peaches.7



There may be nothing necessarily incorrect about the facts reported. But the tone and implications are possibly misleading. It is hard to accept the otherwise marginally significant facts without also accepting the provocative metaphors and sense of impending doom. Those actions have less antagonistic explanations and more benign interpretations.



The actions of Indonesia, Argentina, and Brazil are consistent with their rights under the WTO agreements and will have a negligible collective impact on world trade. Russia is not even a member of the WTO and frequently behaves outside of international norms, so its actions have very limited representative value. And France has intervened to block foreign takeovers of French companies on other occasions this decade, so its actions are not particularly noteworthy. The popular media usually lacks nuance in its accounting of trade policy events and often intones that the present will be a replay of the 1930s.



 **A Little Perspective, Please**



Although some governments will dabble in some degree of protectionism, the combination of a sturdy rules‐​based system of trade and the economic self interest in being open to participation in the global economy will limit the risk of a protectionist pandemic. According to recent estimates from the International Food Policy Research Institute, if _all_ WTO members were to raise all of their applied tariffs to the _maximum_ bound rates, the average global rate of duty would double and the value of global trade would decline by 7.7 percent over five years.8 That would be a substantial decline relative to the 5.5 percent annual rate of trade growth experienced this decade.9



But, to put that 7.7 percent decline in historical perspective, the value of global trade declined by 66 percent between 1929 and 1934, a period mostly in the wake of Smoot Hawley’s passage in 1930.10 So the potential downside today from what Bergsten calls “legal protectionism” is actually not that “massive,” even if _all_ WTO members raised _all_ of their tariffs to the _highest_ permissible rates.



If most developing countries raised their tariffs to their bound rates, there would be an adverse impact on the countries that raise barriers and on their most important trade partners. But most developing countries that have room to backslide (i.e., not China) are not major importers, and thus the impact on global trade flows would not be that significant. OECD countries and China account for the top twothirds of global import value.11 Backsliding from India, Indonesia, and Argentina (who collectively account for 2.4 percent of global imports) is not going to be the spark that ignites a global trade war. Nevertheless, governments are keenly aware of the events that transpired in the 1930s, and have made various pledges to avoid protectionist measures in combating the current economic situation.



In the United States, after President Obama publicly registered his concern that the “Buy American” provision in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act might be perceived as protectionist or could incite a trade war, Congress agreed to revise the legislation to stipulate that the Buy American provision “be applied in a manner consistent with United States obligations under international agreements.” In early February, China’s vice commerce minister, Jiang Zengwei, announced that China would not include “Buy China” provisions in its own $586 billion stimulus bill.12



But even more promising than pledges to avoid trade provocations are actions taken to _reduce_ existing trade barriers. In an effort to “reduce business operating costs, attract and retain foreign investment, raise business productivity, and provide consumers a greater variety and better quality of goods and services at competitive prices,” the Mexican government initiated a plan in January to unilaterally reduce tariffs on about 70 percent of the items on its tariff schedule. Those 8,000 items, comprising 20 different industrial sectors, accounted for about half of all Mexican import value in 2007. When the final phase of the plan is implemented on January 1, 2013, the average industrial tariff rate in Mexico will have fallen from 10.4 percent to 4.3 percent.13



And Mexico is not alone. In February, the Brazilian government suspended tariffs entirely on some capital goods imports and reduced to 2 percent duties on a wide variety of machinery and other capital equipment, and on communications and information technology products.14 That decision came on the heels of late‐​January decision in Brazil to scrap plans for an import licensing program that would have affected 60 percent of the county’s imports.15



Meanwhile, on February 27, a new free trade agreement was signed between Australia, New Zealand, and the 10 member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to reduce and ultimately eliminate tariffs on 96 percent of all goods by 2020.



While the media and members of the trade policy community fixate on how various protectionist measures around the world might foreshadow a plunge into the abyss, there is plenty of evidence that governments remain interested in removing barriers to trade. Despite the occasional temptation to indulge discredited policies, there is a growing body of institutional knowledge that when people are free to engage in commerce with one another as they choose, regardless of the nationality or location of the other parties, they can leverage that freedom to accomplish economic outcomes far more impressive than when governments attempt to limit choices through policy constraints.



 **A Growing Constituency for Freer Trade**



The WTO/GATT system was created in the first place to deter a protectionist pandemic triggered by global economic contraction. It was created to deal with the very situation that is at hand. But in today’s integrated global economy, those rules are not the only incentives to keep trade barriers in check. With the advent and proliferation of transnational supply chains, cross‐​border direct investment, multinational joint ventures, and equity tie‐​ups, the “Us versus Them” characterization of world commerce no longer applies.



Most WTO members are happy to lower tariffs because imports provide consumers with lower prices and greater variety, which incentivizes local business to improve quality and productivity, which is crucial to increasing living standards. Moreover, many local economies now rely upon access to imported raw materials, components, and capital equipment for their own value‐​added activities. To improve chances to attract investment and talent in a world where capital (physical, financial, and human) is increasingly mobile, countries must maintain policies that create a stable business climate with limited administrative, logistical, and physical obstacles.



The experience of India is instructive. Prior to reforms beginning in the 1990s, India’s economy was virtually closed. The average tariff rate on intermediate goods in 1985 was nearly 150 percent. By 1997 the rate had been reduced to 30 percent. As trade barriers were reduced, imports of intermediate goods more than doubled. The tariff reductions caused prices to fall and Indian industry suddenly had access to components and materials it could not import previously. That access enabled Indian manufacturers to cut costs and use the savings to invest in new product lines, which was a process that played a crucial role in the overall growth of the Indian economy.16



India’s approach has been common in the developing world, where most comprehensive trade reforms during the past quarter century have been undertaken unilaterally, without any external pressure, because governments recognized that structural reforms were in their country’s interest. According to the World Bank, between 1983 and 2003, developing countries reduced their weighted average tariffs by almost 21 percentage points (from 29.9 percent to 9.3 percent) and unilateral reforms accounted for 66 percent of those cuts.17



 **The Indispensible Nation**



The United States accounts for the highest percentage of world trade and has the world’s largest economy. The WTO/GATT system is a U.S.-inspired and U.S.-shaped institution. Recession in the United States has triggered a cascade of economic contractions around the world, particularly in export‐​dependent economies. Needless to say, U.S. trade policy is closely and nervously observed in other countries.



But despite the occasional anti‐​trade rhetoric of the Democratic Congress and the protectionist‐​sounding campaign pledges of President Obama, the United States is unlikely to alter its strong commitment to the global trading system. There is simply too much at stake. Like businesses in other countries, U.S. businesses have become increasingly reliant on transnational supply chains. Over 55 percent of U.S. import value in 2007 was of intermediate goods, which indicates that U.S. producers depend highly on imported materials, components, and capital equipment. And there is also the fact that 95 percent of the world’s population lives outside of the United States, so an open trade policy is an example to uphold.



Finally, the President has made it a priority to restore squandered U.S. credibility with the international community. That objective cannot be fulfilled by acting in a multilateral, internationalist manner on foreign policy, while acting in a provocative or unilateralist manner on trade policy because, for most countries, U.S. trade openness and engagement is the form of diplomacy that matters most. Accordingly, the president will have to thwart the Congress’s sometimes combative, unilateralist tendencies on trade policy if he hopes to restore U.S. foreign policy credibility.



 **Conclusion**



Despite the global economic contraction and the occasional protectionist indulgence, there is reason to be hopefulthat retrogressive policies will be marginal, short‐​lived, and ultimately rejected. The absence of trade rules in the 1930s meant that there were no proffered courses of action, no sources of adjudication or remediation, and no generally accepted limits to the actions governments could take in response to external economic policies. And there were far fewer domestic constituencies of any political consequence advocating against protectionism in the ‘30s. Consequently, there were no proven stopgaps to prevent the pandemic of spiraling protectionism that erupted and exacerbated the global recession.



Today we have the benefit of understanding the consequences of the actions taken in the 1930s. Although that understanding does not guarantee avoidance of past mistakes, we also have solid institutions and incentives to help steer policymakers away from the abyss. The rules governing more than 60 years of trade liberalization have fostered greater certainty and stability, and thus more investment, trade, and economic growth. And today, the commercial and political appeal of protectionism is considerably diminished because most countries have established domestic constituencies that depend on a trade and investment environment that is open in both directions.

It had to appease the wishes of many more established members to win approval for its own membership, whereas India’s relatively flexible situation owes to its longer standing membership and its participation in previous negotiating rounds.

At Wednesday’s Democratic debate in Las Vegas, Vanessa Hauc of Telemundo asked former Vice President Joe Biden about his expressed desire to “hold oil and gas executives accountable for their role in harming our planet. You have even suggested that you might put them in jail.”



Biden dodged in his answer, but Vox has now put out a roundup of the Democratic candidates’ published views on prosecuting fossil fuel executives. It’s worth a look.



To begin with the more normal responses, candidates Mike Bloomberg, Joe Biden, and Pete Buttigieg all basically promise stepped‐​up enforcement of existing laws, with Bloomberg additionally saying he will “strengthen rules” allowing the Department of Justice to bring criminal cases, and Biden saying he will “seek additional legislation as needed to hold corporate executives personally accountable—including jail time where merited.” Elizabeth Warren repeats her proposal—which I’ve criticized in some detail—for new legislation attaching criminal liability to negligence that leads to “severe harm.”



Bernie Sanders has never cut his ties to a branch of the socialist tradition in which the conviction gets settled first and the law is discovered afterward.



What about the idea that advocacy on the wrong side of climate debates should carry legal consequences? In a brief—but disturbing—reference, Sen. Amy Klobuchar favors holding “companies accountable for their … campaigns to mislead the public.” Justice Stephen Breyer, in _Nike_ v. _Kasky_ , rightly called out schemes to impose liability on businesses for promoting faulty public policy views as inconsistent with the First Amendment.



But at least Klobuchar doesn’t seem to be promoting the idea of _criminal_ liability—a difference as big as that between “Sue her!” and “Lock her up!”



Some Senate Democrats, however (as well as some other officials), do seem to be interested in applying criminal law to “wrongful advocacy” by businesses—or even by nonprofits and university scholars.



Sometimes they reach for stretchy theories of conspiracy or “racketeering” to achieve this purpose, or, as in New York, see it as securities fraud (a theory that crashed and burned big time in New York’s Exxon prosecution last December). For years now, proposals have circulated to make the denial of climate change consensus a criminal matter, perhaps as a “crime against humanity.” Tom Steyer might be on this page, calling for “real—potentially criminal—consequences for actions [executives] may have taken to _knowingly_ _spread false information and slow climate action_.” The emphasis here is added because the qualifiers— “knowingly,” “false,” “slow,” and “action”—are so nebulous that it’s impossible to know what Steyer really means. It’s possible that he has no idea, either.



But in a class by himself is Bernie Sanders.



Sanders has repeatedly sounded variations on the theme: “Fossil fuel executives should be criminally prosecuted for the destruction they have knowingly caused.”



He does not say what criminal law he thinks they have broken, despite the plain current legality under current law of operating refineries, at‐​pump gas sales and so forth. But note that Sanders’ language is not forward-looking—it’s retrospective. He’s not just talking about passing some new law and then arresting executives who proceed to violate it. He is talking about prosecuting past lawful behavior.



It’s a reminder that for all his talk of Denmark‐​this and Sweden‐​that, Bernie Sanders has never cut his ties to a branch of the socialist tradition in which the conviction gets settled first and the law is discovered afterward.



America needs a politics with fewer authoritarian impulses, not more.

Nearly a week has passed since the Fifth Circuit affirmed the injunction against President Obama’s executive action on immigration, known as DAPA (Deferred Action for Parents of Americans). After digesting the 70‐​page majority opinion and 54‐​page dissent (plus the 11‐​page DAPA memo that’s an appendix), I can say that there aren’t any real surprises but we should keep in mind the following points as this case moves forward to the Supreme Court:



1\. Standing is very important. Have the plaintiffs been hurt by the federal action in a way that gets them into court? If the 26 states simply don’t like President Obama’s policy, that isn’t enough. Both the Fifth Circuit and the district court accepted Texas’s argument that DAPA would force the state to incur the cost of issuing driver’s licenses, which is indeed a direct cost of an executive decision that expands eligibility for various state benefits. Ironically, one of the key precedents supporting the argument for state standing is _Massachusetts v. EPA_ (2007), which found states to have standing to challenge the Bush‐​era EPA on climate‐​change (in)actions because, roughly speaking, their coastlines are eroding. Texas’s claim of harm here, if anything, seems stronger and less nebulous.



2\. “Justiciability” is similarly crucial. (Indeed, it takes more than half the majority opinion to get past these “threshold” matters.) That is, even if the state plaintiffs are hurt such that they have standing, if a court can’t adjudicate the dispute–because, say, there’s an exercise of prosecutorial discretion that courts don’t review–then the case should be dismissed as “non‐​justiciable” (as the dissent argues). This is likely to be the point on which the case will ultimately turn; just look at the administration’s immediate reaction:



The Department of Justice remains committed to taking steps that will resolve the immigration litigation as quickly as possible in order to allow DHS to bring greater accountability to our immigration system by _prioritizing the removal of the worst offenders_ , not people who have long ties to the United States and who are raising American children.



But the lawsuit doesn’t challenge the ability of government to prioritize the deportation of human traffickers over nannies–and indeed immigration authorities have been doing that since time immemorial. Can you shoehorn an entirely new federal program/​benefit into that uncontroversial enforcement discretion?



3\. The appellate court didn’t simply affirm the district court’s finding that the executive action violated the Administrative Procedure Act, but also added a further justification, that DAPA exceeds the executive’s statutory authority. If the Supreme Court ends up leaving the injunction in place, it doesn’t much matter for practical purposes whether it does so because (a) the administration violated the APA by not engaging in notice‐​and‐​comment rulemaking, (b) it doesn’t have the legal authority under the relevant immigration laws, or (c) it exceeds the president’s power under Article II’s Take Care Clause (as Cato argues in our amicus brief). The district judge focused entirely on the first (administrative) point, with which the Fifth Circuit agreed but then went on to provide an alternative holding on the second (statutory) point. And the third (constitutional) point looms atmospherically in the background.



For more detailed examinations of the Fifth Circuit ruling, see Josh Blackman’s diligent series of posts on standing, justiciability, the procedural claim, the substantive claim, the dissenting opinion generally and on standing and justiciability.



So where do we go from here? The Supreme Court is certain to take the case, but the question is when. Recent practice suggests that for the case to be heard this term, the Court must be in a position to “conference” the case by the end of January. That means that all the briefing must be complete in time for consideration by the justices and their clerks a little before that. SCOTUSblog’s sources indicate that we can expect the government to file a cert petition by the end of the week. Texas will then have 30 days to reply. The government will probably discourage its amici from filing briefs because that would give Texas reason to ask for a 30‐​day extension on its deadline–but Texas could ask for that extension regardless, and the Court grants such requests as a matter of course.



But the government may not actually be in such a hurry. Earlier this year, it delayed in filing its “emergency” motion to stay the district court’s February ruling, and then it took a while to decide how to respond to the Fifth Circuit’s denial of that motion, ultimately deciding against seeking Supreme Court review at that stage. So it could be that for either political or legal reasons–because it’s unsure or dubious of whether it will find five votes at the high court–it won’t mind having _Texas v. United States_ pushed into the next term.



That would keep the case alive through the presidential election. Hillary Clinton’s response on this issue at the Democratic debate Saturday night was muddled–she thought that the government had already appealed and claimed that DAPA covered the parents of so‐​called DREAMers, which it doesn’t (because the president’s own legal advisers said he couldn’t go that far)–but she has said previously that she would expand on President Obama’s actions.



And, of course, if a Republican wins the White House, he or she could withdraw the DAPA memo, thereby ending the program and mooting the case. Stay tuned.

From the International Council for Science,  something for the beleaguered climate science community to consider.
Responsibilities of scientists underlined by scientific community
Rome, Italy – The General Assembly of the International Council for Science (ICSU) today reaffirmed the universal values that should guide the conduct of science. It explicitly recognized the key social responsibilities of the scientific community that need to accompany the free practice of science. While the focus of the Principle of Universality of Science – which is central to ICSU’s statutes and a basic condition of worldwide membership of the ICSU family – has been on the preservation of scientific freedoms, ICSU is mindful of the need for scientists to pay equal attention to their responsibilities.
“The balance between scientific freedom and responsibility is not always easy to get right, but awareness of its significance and of the value of ongoing dialogue must be maintained within the scientific community.” says Bengt Gustafsson, Chair of ICSU’s Committee on Freedom and Responsibility in the conduct of Science (CFRS). “By extending its consideration of the long-established Principle of the Universality to explicitly include responsibilities as well as freedoms, ICSU has emphasized that this balance is critical both for science and society.”
The new wording of the Principle was approved today by the membership of ICSU at its General Assembly in Rome. It reads as follows:
The Principle of Universality (freedom and responsibility) of Science
The free and responsible practice of science is fundamental to scientific advancement and human and environmental well-being. Such practice, in all its aspects, requires freedom of movement, association, expression and communication for scientists, as well as equitable access to data, information, and other resources for research. It requires responsibility at all levels to carry out and communicate scientific work with integrity, respect, fairness, trustworthiness, and transparency, recognising its benefits and possible harms.
In advocating the free and responsible practice of science, ICSU promotes equitable opportunities for access to science and its benefits, and opposes discrimination based on such factors as ethnic origin, religion, citizenship, language, political or other opinion, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, or age.
Promoting good scientific conduct and preventing misconduct is critical for science as a whole, and for this reason ICSU’s CFRS was also heavily engaged in the organization of the second World Conference on Research Integrity in Singapore in July 2010. The Singapore Statement on Research Integrity, which stemmed from the event, was presented to the Assembly in Rome. The statement emphasizes the need for honesty in all aspects of research, accountability in the conduct of scientific research, professional courtesy and fairness in working with others, and good stewardship of research on behalf of others.
Gustafsson adds: “As our world evolves, there are continually changing challenges to the freedoms of scientists, and an increased onus on the scientific community to articulate and embrace its responsibilities. Whilst there can be national, and even disciplinary, differences in the way research is actually carried out, there are certain principles and responsibilities that are fundamental to ‘good science’. Given the unique position of scientists as the gate-keepers of new knowledge in today’s knowledge societies, respect for these values is critically important if confidence in science is to be maintained.”
###About ICSU
Founded in 1931, ICSU is a non-governmental organization with a global membership of national scientific bodies (120 Members, representing 140 countries) and International Scientific Unions (30 Members). The Council’s activities focus on three areas: planning and coordinating research; science for policy; and strengthening the Universality of Science. ICSU is frequently called upon to speak on behalf of the global scientific community and to act as an advisor in matters ranging from the environment to conduct in science. www.icsu.org

Share this...FacebookTwitterBy coincidence I came across a report at the cleveland.com by Henry J. Gomez about Ohio US Senate candidate Josh Mandel, who rightfully challenges global warming science.
Gomez writes:
Josh Mandel, Ohio’s Republican U.S. Senate candidate and an outspoken critic of White House environmental policies, said Sunday that he doubts the presence of global warming. The state treasurer thinks scientific research on the matter ‘is inconclusive and riddled with fraud.'”
Hate to tell you this, Gomez, but Mandel is 100% right on, and it wouldn’t hurt for you to look at the global temperature data. Gomez continues:
Mandel, who faces incumbent Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown this fall, made the comment during an interview with The Plain Dealer here on the eve of the GOP convention. Mandel, of Beachwood, also addressed Ohio delegates at a brunch.”

I especially liked the following part:
Pressed further on his skepticism over widely accepted scientific reports of global warming, Mandel said: ‘I’ve never claimed to be a scientist, and I never will.’
But he referred to reports from Europe that his campaign spokesman, Travis Considine, later identified as from Fritz Vahrenholt, a German former environmental leader who has said that the role of carbon dioxide, emitted from coal, is overestimated.”
First, Gomez needs to note that Professor Vahrenholt is still a very committed environmental leader and he not only is a source of scientific reports – but he also co-authored an entire book on the subject together with geologist Dr. Sebastian Lüning. The book, which cites more than 800 sources, many peer-reviewed, is called: “Die kalte Sonne” (The cold Sun), and it zoomed up the bestseller charts in Germany for 3 weeks earlier this year.
Unfortunately the book is not available in English, as the publisher is sitting on the English version. That’s a pity because people like Gomez could really benefit from it.
Good for Josh Mandel and let’s wish him lots of success against Sherrod Brown!

That is effectively what coastal residents around New Zealand are being told by their Local Authorities as councils get their big red pens out and draw lines on ‘hazard’ maps and attach notes to LIMs.



Way back in 2008, the Ministry for the Environment used 2007 data to make up some numbers:



And then local councils were tasked with plotting this nonsense on their hazard maps. Speaking from experience, once there is a line like this on your property LIM **it is very difficult to get insurance.** If a purchaser needs a mortgage they cannot get one as banks etc require a property to be insured before granting a mortgage. No insurance = no mortgage = no sale. **You are sitting on an unsaleable, uninsurable asset.**



Instead of a model created 12 years ago, why not use some up-to-date real-world data? 



A [2019 study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468013319300567) of the most reliable tide gauges in the world, with more than 100 years of good quality data found 76 that matched that benchmark. One was in New Zealand. It was the Dunedin gauge, a city where 3604 homes, 185 businesses and 72km of roads are going to drown according to the alarmists.



What did the long term tide gauge records say? Some were up, some were down. The world average was 0.337mm/yr and the acceleration was 0.007mm/yr2.



Dunedin was above average at 1.325mm/yr with an acceleration of 0.01775mm/yr2.



If you remember the equations of motion from school; the distance over time equation is: s = ut + 1/2at2. Distance = s, current velocity is u, acceleration is a and time is t.



The typical figures being used by Local Authorities, based on central government advice is 400 – 600mm sea level rise by 2080 and 800 – 1600mm sea level rise by 2130.



Using the formula above, with the actual historical data and projecting out to 2080 and 2130 the sea level rise will be:



World average: 33.58 and 80.53mm (compare 400/600 and 800/1600)  
Dunedin: 113.85 and 254.42mm (compare 400/600 and 800/1600)



At the current rate, it will **343 years before** there is 150cm of sea-level rise in Dunedin, not really a climate emergency that needs a line on property LIMs just yet.



Tasman is the latest area to hit the headlines with this stupidity.



About 5500 letters from Tasman District Council are expected to arrive this week in the mailboxes of people whose properties have been identified as potentially at risk. Those properties are within or partially within areas affected by a range of sea level rise scenarios on new council coastal hazard maps, scheduled to be available on the council website from Monday.



The maps show areas of low-lying land and how it may be affected by sea level rise scenarios in half-metre increments, from **0.5 metres to 2m**. They also show the effect of a higher tides caused by storms. Areas of coastal erosion and sediment gain have been mapped along with structures such as stopbanks, walls and rock revetments.

Yellow starthistle is indeed a problem in western states, but the problem preceded “climate change” by decades.  See the end of the press release for more.

Climate change allows invasive weed to outcompete local species
May 31, 2011
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – Yellow starthistle already causes millions of dollars in damage to pastures in western states each year, and as climate changes, land managers can expect the problem with that weed and others to escalate.
When exposed to increased carbon dioxide, precipitation, nitrogen and temperature – all expected results of climate change – yellow starthistle in some cases grew to six times its normal size while the other grassland species remained relatively unchanged, according to a Purdue University study published in the early online edition of the journal Ecological Applications. The plants were compared with those grown under ambient conditions.

“The rest of the grassland didn’t respond much to changes in conditions except nitrogen,” said Jeff Dukes, a Purdue associate professor of forestry and natural resources and the study’s lead author. “We’re likely to see these carbon dioxide concentrations in the second half of this century. Our results suggest that yellow starthistle will be a very happy camper in the coming decades.”
The study is one of the first comparing the growth of invasive species versus their local competitors under future climate scenarios. Dukes believes the results indicate problems land managers and crop growers could see in the coming decades, and not just with yellow starthistle.
“Plants are going to respond in a number of ways to climate change. Sometimes, the species we depend on will benefit, but other times, it will be the weedy, problematic species that benefit most, and there can be economic and ecological damages associated that people should be aware of,” Dukes said. “These problems with yellow starthistle aren’t going to go away on their own. If anything it’s going to become more of a problem than it is now.”
Yellow starthistle is a significant weed in the West, especially in California, where it has a longer growing season than native plants and depletes ground moisture, affecting water supplies.


Image via Wikipedia


“It reduces the quality of the area for animal forage, is toxic to horses and when it forms spines, cattle don’t want to eat it,” Dukes said. “Many consider yellow starthistle to be the worst grassland weed in the West.”
The decreased pasture production, lost water, and control costs associated with yellow starthistle cause economic impacts in many western states. Experts suggest that in Idaho alone, the weed may cause more than $12 million a year in economic damage and that yellow starthistle reduces pasture values by 6 percent to 7 percent across the state of California.
Dukes said all plants increased in size as expected when exposed to more nitrogen. But yellow starthistle was especially responsive to increased carbon dioxide.
That might be in part because the weed can gain access to more soil resources, Dukes said. Grassland plants’ stomata, small porelike openings on the leaves, don’t have to be open as wide to take in carbon dioxide when there is a larger concentration in the air. Those smaller stomata allow less water to escape, and the extra water in the soil could favor yellow starthistle. The added carbon dioxide also changed the mix of species competing with the weed and may have allowed it to grow a more effective root system.
“It was an impressive increase in growth,” Dukes said. “It was one of the largest responses to elevated carbon dioxide ever observed.”
Biological control species introduced to control yellow starthistle have not been effective enough, and Dukes said it is becoming urgent that better controls be developed to address invasive species that could cause significant damage to pasture, cropland and wildlands.
The National Science Foundation and the David and Lucile Packard Foundation funded the research, which was carried out in collaboration with researchers at the University of Massachusetts Boston, Stanford University and the Carnegie Institution for Science.

==========================================================================
From Wikipedia: it seems the spread of this weed preceded the global warming issue by decades:
After the turn of the 20th century, Spain, France, Italy, and perhaps Turkestan were also likely sources of the invasion’s seed. Since its introduction to California in the mid-nineteenth century, it has become a large-scale invasive species (noxious weed or invasive exotic) throughout twenty three states. It currently dominates over 15,000,000 acres (61,000 km2) in California alone.
By 1970, yellow star-thistle had reached 23 U.S. states. According to the USDA Forest Service, as of 2006 the plant has been reported present in 41 of the 48 contiguous U.S. states, with the only exceptions being Maine, Vermont, and five of the Deep South states (Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia). The plant is considered an invasive species in six of the 41 states: California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Utah, and New Jersey.
Also, here’s an article from 2004, by a US Forest Service expert on Yellow Starthistle, called Explosion in Slow Motion. Not a peep about climate change or global warming being a contributing factor.
Oh but wait, there’s more, just two years ago we read that climate change may actually get rid of star thistle and other noxious weeds.
From The Nature Files: An upside to climate change?
They’re the five “dirty words” of the West — cheatgrass; spotted knapweed; yellow starthistle; tamarisk; and leafy spurge — but the battle against these pervasive troublemakers could receive a boost from an unlikely ally, climate change. Scientists from Princeton University have determined that climate change will very likely cause massive die-offs of these invasive plants across the West, creating unprecedented opportunities to restore millions of acres of infected wilderness to native vegetation.
The findings, released this month in the journal Global Change Biology, will help land managers develop long-term invasive plant recovery projects. The restorative potential comes at a price however, as the model used in the study also predicts that some populations of invasive plants may simply shift their ranges to new areas — yellow starthistle will likely move from its current range in California, Oregon and Washington to a new ranges in California and Nevada for example.
Here’s the press release and link to paper:
Public release date: 27-Jan-2009
Climate change’s impact on invasive plants in Western US may create restoration opportunities
Princeton, NJ – January 27, 2009 – A new study by researchers at Princeton University’s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs has found that global climate change may lead to the retreat of some invasive plant species in the western United States, which could create unprecedented ecological restoration opportunities across millions of acres throughout America. At the same time, global warming may enable other invasive plants to spread more widely.
The study, “Climate change and plant invasions: restoration opportunities ahead?”, was co-authored by Bethany Bradley, a biogeographer, Michael Oppenheimer, a geoscientist, and David Wilcove, a conservation biologist, at Princeton’s Woodrow Wilson School, and is published in the journal Global Change Biology.
The article is accessible online at http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/121521769/abstract.
The researchers assessed the relationship between climate change and the distribution of five prominent invasive plants in the western United States – known colloquially as the “kudzus of the West” – cheatgrass; spotted knapweed; yellow starthistle; tamarisk; and leafy spurge. Such plants are defined as invasive because they were brought into this country from other lands and now dominate and alter ecosystems in ways that threaten native wildlife, agriculture, and ranching. All have greatly expanded their ranges in recent decades in the western U.S., causing millions of dollars in damage to farmlands and rangelands. Invasive plants are increasingly expensive to control, and it is widely believed that global warming will make the problem worse.
But Bradley and her co-authors find that global warming may also reduce the competitiveness of some invasive plants if conditions become climatically unsuitable to the weeds, “creating opportunities for restoration in areas currently dominated by intractable invasive species,” according to the study.

"**Are we about to see the first real parliamentary crisis of the pandemic?**
New regulations creating the revised tier system in England and the loosening for Christmas are due before Parliament on Tuesday - and real trouble is clearly brewing on the Tory backbenches.
A dangerous number of normally loyal backbenchers are threatening rebellion, in terms which make it hard for them to climb down without some real government concessions, perhaps on parliamentary oversight of the restrictions, or on trying to localise them with greater precision.
It's worth noting the arithmetic here: it would normally take a rebellion of around 40 Conservatives to cancel out the government's majority.
But on this issue the 47 SNP MPs would not normally vote, which gives the government a more comfortable margin. And in any event Labour will probably support the restrictions, after extracting a price.
So it's not the prospect of defeat, so much as the corrosive impact of having to rely on Labour to get the regulations through that is the problem for ministers.
And the increasingly sharp tone of the government's Conservative critics is striking; a big Conservative vote against these regulations will create dangerous new fault-lines. And that's before we get on to the possibility of some kind of outcome to the post-Brexit trade talks with the EU, which may re-expose some old fault-lines.
Elsewhere, here are a few more Westminster sub-plots to watch out for:
Here's my rundown of the week ahead:
The Commons opens (14:30) with an hour of Work and Pensions Questions. And that's usually followed by ministerial statements and Urgent Questions.
The main legislation is the Telecommunications (Security) Bill, which seeks to create a stronger telecoms security framework for the era of 5G and the increasingly pervasive digital networks it will enable.
The Bill will also introduce new national security powers for the government to manage risks posed by ""high-risk vendors"" - clauses aimed at the Chinese 5G provider, Huawei.
In Westminster Hall there are two debates scheduled by the Petitions Committee.
Firstly (at 16:30) is e-petition 255823, which calls for a full public inquiry into the death in a mental health facility of 20 year-old Matthew Leahy. The petition, started by Matthew's mother, says ""something went terribly wrong with the NHS mental health services provided to my son"".
Matthew, it says, was taken to ""a place of safety"" and died seven days later. The petition, which attracted more than 105,000 signatures, says 24 other people have died in similar circumstances since 2000.
In response, the government expressed sincere regrets over Matthew's death; NHS Improvement will review the care he and others received and will provide advice in due course on whether a public inquiry should be held.
That is followed (at 18:00) by a shorter debate on e-petition 331453 entitled ""Scrap removal of free transport for under-18s from TfL bailout"" The petition argues that destroying free travel would hurt many teenagers, and it has attracted 170,649 signatures.
On the Committee Corridor, Public Accounts (14:30) takes evidence on one of its hardy perennial subjects - lessons from major projects and programmes - from Nick Smallwood, the Chief Executive of the Infrastructure and Projects Authority.
In the Lords (13:00) questions range across private investment in the hydrogen sector, and the case for convening a summit of the governments of the 10 leading democracies in spring 2021.
The main legislative action is the Report Stage consideration of the High Speed Rail (West Midlands-Crewe) Bill - where the architect of HS2, and former Transport Secretary, Lord Adonis, will seek to safeguard the next stages of the project, with an amendment requiring the current Transport Secretary to lay plans for the line from the West Midlands to Sheffield and Leeds before Parliament within six months of the Bill being passed into law.
There is also a motion to defer the Report Stage and refer some issues to a special committee - but this is thought unlikely to be pushed to a vote.
The Commons opens (at 11:30) with Treasury Questions.
There's then an interesting Ten Minute Rule Bill on apologies, from the Conservative John Howell.
He's Chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Dispute Resolution, and he wants the UK to follow the example of other countries which allow apologies to be made for, for example, mistakes in treatment in a hospital, without this counting as an admission of liability, which can be used in court.
That is followed by the week's major event - the debate on the regulations which will underpin the new three-tier system for coronavirus restrictions in England, and the loosening proposed for the Christmas holiday.
These will be orders made under the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984 and, unusually, they will be debated in the House of Lords at more or less the same time, in order to get them into law by Wednesday.
In Westminster Hall (at 09:30) the DUP's Jim Shannon leads a debate on raising awareness of signs and symptoms of cancer in teenage and young adults, and the Conservative Claire Coutinho has a debate on proposals to designate land as wild belt areas (14:30).
Offstage, there's a considerable helping of select committee action: The Treasury Committee (09:30) takes evidence on the latest Spending Review, and will hear from Richard Hughes, Chair of the Office for Budget Responsibility and supporting cast; a session with economists follows on Wednesday.
Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs (09:30) questions the Chair of the Committee on Standards in Public Life Lord Evans of Weardale. I daresay the subject of the home secretary might come up.
Health and Social Care and Science and Technology (09:30) continue their fascinating series of hearings on Coronavirus: lessons learnt, with a look at the impact of Covid on people from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic backgrounds as well as people with learning disabilities, who are estimated to have a death rate of four times higher than average.
Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (10:30) have a hearing on the government's preparations for the COP-26 climate conference and on efforts to achieve net-zero.
In the Lords (12:00) questions have a World AIDS Day theme, with Baroness Barker asking about ending HIV transmissions by 2030 and Lord Cashman asking about the impact of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PREP) on new HIV transmissions.
There's also a question on support for older people at risk from domestic abuse during the pandemic
Then, peers move on to day two of committee stage consideration of the Covert Human Intelligence Sources (Criminal Conduct) Bill. This, remember, is the probing stage of scrutiny, and there are unlikely to be any votes.
But the issues in play include different levels of oversight, plus calls for assurances that trade union activity can't be affected by the powers under the Bill.
This is followed by a four-hour debate on the new Coronavirus restrictions - the same as those before the Commons. It's almost unheard of for peers to reject regulations, but someone might well put down a ""regret motion"".
Commons business opens (at 11:30) with half an hour of Northern Ireland questions, followed by Prime Minister's Question Time.
The day's Ten Minute Rule Bill, proposed by the DUP's Jim Jim Shannon, is on providing Automated External Defibrillators.
Then MPs consider a batch of mostly Brexit-related regulations.
In Westminster Hall subjects for debate include: access to cancer diagnosis and treatment during the pandemic (09:30) and homelessness and temporary accommodation (14:30).
Again, there's plenty of committee action. The Treasury Committee (14:30) continues its scrutiny of the Spending Review with a panel of economists including Paul Johnson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies
Environmental Audit (14:30) will hold its final session on the Energy Efficiency of Existing Homes, quizzing Ministers Kwasi Kwarteng, Christopher Pincher and Kemi Badenoch.
Women and Equalities (14:30 )have witnesses from L'OrÃ©al Paris, Dove, Boohoo, Sport England, the Advertising Standards Authority and Transport for London for a session in their inquiry into body image
In the Lords (12:00) questions cover support for the operation of Belfast International Airport, protection for children groomed into filming their own abuse online and the future of European security cooperation
Then, having extensively rewritten it, peers will zip through the Third Reading of the United Kingdom Internal Market Bill.
It will then ping back to the Commons for what could prove to be an extensive bout of parliamentary ping pong. The government was defeated seven times on key aspects of the Bill, most notably the crushing Committee Stage vote, where the controversial law-breaking powers were struck out by a majority of 268 votes.
Unless a deal with the EU gets everyone off the hook, it may well be that the Lords refuses to budge, even if the government majority in the Commons reverses the changes they have made.
The result may be that ping pong, appearing on the agenda as Lords ""consideration of Commons Reasons"" and Commons ""consideration of Lords Amendments"" may become a daily, even hourly event in the run up to the end of the Brexit transition period, and perhaps beyond.
MPs begin their day (at 09:30) with Transport Questions, followed by the weekly Commons Business Statement from the Leader of the House.
The main business is two debates chosen by the Backbench Business Committee - first on the future of coal in the UK, then on digital infrastructure, connectivity and accessibility.
In Westminster Hall (13:30) there are more backbench debates, firstly on access to and acceptance of cash during the Covid outbreak led by former ministers Paul Maynard and David Mundell.
The second debate (15:00) is on the future of nurseries and early years settings, focusing on the problems flowing from the policy of providing 30 hours of funded childcare for three and four-year olds - which has led to many providers struggling to remain financially sustainable.
The financial challenge has been starkly highlighted by the pandemic, leaving 25% of providers facing permanent closure within the year. The sponsors of the debate, Tories Steve Brine and Theresa Villiers and Labour's Jack Dromey, want the system overhauled.
The day's committee action sees Public Accounts (10:00) quizzing Tamara Finkelstein, the Permanent Secretary at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs on the government's long-term environmental goals.
And Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (11:00) holds the final evidence session in its inquiry into flooding in England. starring Environment Secretary George Eustice and Housing Minister Lord Greenhalgh.
In the Lords (12:00) question time includes the historian Lord Lexden asking about the review of the National Trust Acts, and there will also be questions on National Planning Policy Statements, the Paris Climate Agreement and on access to Child Trust Funds by children with learning disabilities
Then peers move on to day three of committee scrutiny of the Covert Human Intelligence Sources (Criminal Conduct) Bill.
They will discuss limiting the types of crimes that can be authorised under the bill, and protections for children and vulnerable people.
Neither House is due to sit on Friday."

JTWC Warning Graphic for Yasi
Flood ravaged Queensland is preparing for a monstrous South Pacific Ocean Tropical Cyclone Yasi.  Forecast to reach Category 4+ strength on the familiar Saffir-Simpson scale, there really is nothing inhibiting this storm from explosively intensifying and reaching 135 knots+ in terms of sustained winds.  Ocean heat content below Yasi is high and sufficient to maintain a very intense TC.  As the USA deals with the upcoming blizzard with a couple feet of snow forecast for the Midwest, the ongoing Southern Hemisphere summer produces tropical cyclones.  In terms of history, Yasi will likely be compared to Cyclone Larry (2006) which made landfall somewhat north of the forecast track of Yasi.  However, the circulation of Yasi is considerably larger and, if it maintains it intensity until landfall, could be one of the strongest and largest TCs to make landfall in Australia in the past century.

Forecasting and Predictability note:  The ECMWF forecast model has been consistently forecasting a major tropical cyclone near or over Queensland on Feb 3 for the last 7-days:  Link to last 14-Forecast Cycles.  This demonstration of 10-day TC track skill is quite impressive.

"If you’ve ever stopped to admire a birch tree, you may unknowingly have something in common with a 5,300-year-old mummy called Ötzi. In 1991, hikers found Ötzi in an alpine glacier on the Austrian-Italian border, and perfectly preserved with him were pieces of fungus attached to leather cords, safely stowed in his bag. That fungus is the same one you can see growing on birch trees today: the birch polypore. Sometimes called birch bracket, and known to scientists as Fomitopsis betulina, the polypore is a parasite that slowly kills the birch before feasting on the dead tree until there is nothing left. The scientists who first identified Ötzi’s ancient birch polypore speculated that he could have used it for medical purposes, as some European cultures in more recent human history have been known to do.  With recorded applications ranging from pain relief, wound dressing, antiseptic and even cancer treatment, birch polypore has been used as a broad spectrum therapy for various health problems. But is there a true medical basis behind the anecdotal folklore? Numerous studies have revealed that birch polypore does indeed produce compounds with antibiotic, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer properties. Piptamine, polyporenic acids and triterpenoids are all compounds produced as part of the fungus’ self-defence mechanism against bacteria, explaining its observed antibiotic value. When tested on dogs and mice suffering from cancer, as well as cancerous cells grown in the lab, birch polypore extracts had a range of anticancer effects such as reducing tumour size and cell growth. It’s hard to identify the mechanisms producing these results, however, as the activity of specific birch polypore compounds is not well understood – they have mostly been studied together in one combined extract, rather than individually isolated. Even more intriguing is that this whole cocktail seems to be more effective than single compounds, which may be a result of a synergistic interaction between the separate ingredients. Further research will be needed to disentangle the relationships in the birch polypore cocktail. Pharmaceuticals are not the only thing that we can look to birch polypore for, though. All fungi have cells walls predominantly made up of things called polysaccharides. The most abundant of these is chitin, which also gets converted into another polysaccharide called chitosan. Both chitin and chitosan have roles in keeping cells hydrated and help protect from bacteria and other fungi, making them ideal components of wound treatments such as hydrogel, membrane and sponge dressings – with the additional benefit of being biodegradable. Another kind of polysaccharide found in fungal cell walls are D-glucans, which have been shown to help regulate the immune system, as well as having some anticancer and antibiotic activity. A specific type of D-glucan in birch polypore is also able to speed up healing by accelerating the movement of cells to the wound site. While the medical explanation is plausible, we will never categorically know that Ötzi used his birch polypore to treat injuries or ill-health. What we do know, thanks to modern chemical analysis, is that the historical use of birch polypore is grounded in real medical properties.  The State of the World’s Fungi report, produced recently by my colleagues at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, highlighted how important fungi have been for the discovery and production of drugs, but also how little we have explored the vast fungal diversity for such uses: addressing new challenges such as antibiotic resistance could well rely on the potentially over 3m unknown species. Fungi have evolved extraordinary compounds and mechanisms which we can utilise for human health, and traditional practices – as in the case of the birch polypore – can act as a signpost for where to look."

National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL) map below shows tornado tracks logged by NEXRAD Doppler Radar
Bright reds, oranges and yellows show tracks of where rotation was strongest as detected by NWS Doppler radars during the April 27, 2011 tornado outbreak. - click to enlarge
NOAA’s preliminary estimate is that there were 211 tornadoes on April 27-28, 2011.

During the multi-day period of April 26-28, The National Weather Service (NWS) estimates there were a total of 288 tornadoes.
NWS issued outlooks five days in advance, watches hours in advance, and tornado warnings with an average lead time of 24 minutes. NWS issued warnings for more than 90 percent of these tornadoes.
The largest previous number of tornadoes on record in one event occurred from April 3-4, 1974, with 148 tornadoes.

Current media reports indicate the death toll is 318 people, and rising. This makes the event the third deadliest tornado outbreak on record.


The April 27-28, 2011, tornado outbreak is the deadliest since the March 21, 1932, tornado outbreak that had 332 fatalities.
Based on combined NOAA, historical research records and current fatality estimates, the April 27-28, 2011, tornado outbreak ranks 6th in single day total fatalities in the United States history. The historic research records extend back to 1680.
The deadliest single tornado on record was the Tri-State Tornado (Mo., Ill., Ind.) on March 18, 1925, when 695 died.
Based on combined NOAA and historical research records, the deadliest single day for tornadoes was March 18, 1925, with 747 fatalities across 7 states (including the Tri State Tornado).


Monthly tornado weather summary

Data is preliminary and subject to revision

Month of April 2011 (and record monthly) tornado statistics  
NWS’s preliminary estimate is that there have been more than 600 tornadoes thus far during the month of April 2011.

"**A council has defended plans for a scaled-down Christmas market despite residents saying it is irresponsible as the city heads into tier three.**
The market in Nottingham city centre will go ahead this year featuring a big wheel, rides and 40 stalls.
The city council said the event - which will run from 5 to 24 December - was important for local people and the economy and could be done safely.
But some residents said they did not think the event should go ahead.
Nottingham City Council said events like the market, which will be open from 10:00 to 21:00 GMT every day, can go ahead under government guidelines.
It said it would be half its usual size, would not have an ice rink this year and no stalls would sell alcohol.
The council said the rides had been risk assessed and parts of the Old Market Square would be shut if they got too busy.
However, Janet Poundall, 62, from Underwood, Nottinghamshire, said she believed the council's decision was ""irresponsible"".
She said: ""The council are encouraging people to come into Nottingham and how are they going to get here? On public transport.
""I don't want to risk staying in tier three for a helter-skelter and a German sausage.""
Veronica Sutcliffe, from Giltbrook, said she was ""incensed"" when she heard about the plans.
""I think it is foolhardy to do this,"" she said.
""People will flock there, it will attract crowds and the sacrifices we have all made will be trampled underfoot. Whoever agreed to this needs a sharp lesson in the stark reality of Covid-19.""
Emma Cowland, 44, from Tollerton, called the Christmas market plans a ""joke"".
She added: ""[This can happen] yet our local pub, who have all the Covid guidelines in place, isn't allowed to open to serve outside? This is absolutely absurd.""
However, other residents backed the idea.
Kerry Machin, 36, from Beeston, said she was excited to take her children for a bit of ""normality and Christmas cheer"".
She added: ""I'm sure the businesses who rely on markets like this for their income will be so happy.""
Nottingham South MP Lilian Greenwood also defended the plans for the market, pointing out non-essential shops would be allowed to reopen and an outdoor alternative ""might be safer"".
Nottingham and Nottinghamshire are re-entering tier three from 2 December, meaning no households can mix indoors or in private gardens. Pubs and restaurants will have to stay closed and people should not travel in or out of the area.
It comes despite the city's infection rate dropping sharply, from the worst in England at points last month to 185.6 per 100,000 in the week leading up to 23 November, according to government figures.
In a statement addressing concerns of residents on social media, the city council said: ""We fully understand that giving the go-ahead for an event this year is an emotive issue.
""We've taken great care in considering Christmas plans for Nottingham this year.
""We hope the market, along with plans to extend opening times in the city centre to stagger shoppers throughout the day, will provide an environment for people to feel festive, support local businesses and, most importantly, stay safe and have a wonderful Christmas.""

 _The Current Wisdom_ is a series of monthly articles in which Senior Fellow Patrick J. Michaels reviews interesting items on global warming in the scientific literature that may not have received the media attention that they deserved, or have been misinterpreted in the popular press.



 _The Current Wisdom_ only comments on science appearing in the refereed, peer‐​reviewed literature, or that has been peer‐​screened prior to presentation at a scientific congress.



Prior to April, 2011, issues of this Wisdom, which began in 2010, are available at our blog Cato@Liberty (www​.cato​-at​-lib​er​ty​.org/).





Boston University’s Robert Kaufmann and colleagues recently published a paper in the _Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences_ examining the causes of the recent dearth of “global warming.” They concluded that it’s simply natural variability, augmented by increasing sulfate emissions from dramatically growing coal consumption by China. 



Of course, it is the latter conclusion that has drawn all the attention, for it allows the possibility that greenhouse gases are continuing to impart an as‐​expected warming influence on the global climate. And then once China gets its air pollution under control (and we are talking about true air pollution here, i.e., _not_ carbon dioxide), global temperatures will rise rapidly. Thus the dream of alarming climate change lives.



If China’s sulfate emissions are not having much of an impact of global temperatures, then, the dearth of warming in recent years supports the hypothesis — now made by many (unpopular) folks in the climate business — that the “sensitivity” of temperature to carbon dioxide has been guessed (we choose our words carefully here) to be too high by climate modelers. In this scenario, we wake up from the alarmist nightmare and resume our normal lives. 



There are two reasons why we think it is wrong for Kaufmann _et al._ to attribute a reduced rate of global warming to Chinese sulfates:



1) China’s cooling sulfates do not readily make their way into the Southern Hemisphere, yet, from 1999–2010, temperatures actually fell there, while they rose in the Northern Hemisphere. This is exactly the opposite of what should have happened if sulfates are exerting a relative cooling primarily in the Northern Hemisphere



2) Chinese coal consumption increased in 2009 and 2010 (in fact, 2010 had the biggest year‐​over‐​year increase recorded) — yet, the global temperature rose sharply in 2009 and in 2010. Because Kaufmann’s climate model responds instantaneously to sulfates (as opposed to a decades‐​long lag to adjust to carbon dioxide changes) this is contrary to his hypothesis. 



Let’s look at the first one. 



The link below shows the march of weather systems around the globe for several months. Notice that the weather systems passing through China quickly move into the north Pacific Ocean, and don’t mix into the Southern Hemisphere. Since sulfates only have an atmospheric lifetime of about a week or so, they are hard pressed to cause any cooling impact beyond the areas to the immediate east of China.



So, if a dramatic increase in Chinese sulfur emissions during the past decade or so has been responsible for the observed slowdown in the rate of _global_ temperature increase, then the Northern Hemisphere should be doing most of the work — that is, the rate of warming in the Northern Hemisphere should have slowed by much more than the rate of warming in the Southern Hemisphere. This situation is easy to check.



Figure 1 shows the Northern and Southern Hemisphere temperature history from 1980 through 2010 according to the surface temperature data set compiled and maintained by the _Climate Research_ Unit at the University of East Anglia. During the period of time during which Chinese sulfate emissions rose (1998–2010), the warming in the Southern Hemisphere went negative (i.e. became a cooling) while the Northern Hemisphere warmed. From Figure 1 it is obvious that the Southern Hemisphere is driving the global temperature slowdown, not the Northern — a result completely contrary to Kaufmann _et al._ ‘s Chinese sulfate hypothesis.





Now let’s turn to our Reason #2. Simply put, during the past 2 years (which were not part of the Kaufmann _et al._ dataset), global temperatures rose _as did Chinese coal consumption_. According to Kaufmann _et al._ ‘s hypothesis, the increase in Chinese coal consumption should act to drive down the rate of global temperature rise, but that is not what happened. Again, temperatures are behaving in an opposite fashion, compared to what the hypothesis predicts. 



The top panel in Figure 2 shows Chinese coal consumption from the BP Statistical Review of World Energy from 1998 through 2010. Notice that it increased substantially in both 2009 and 2010 — two years not included in the Kaufmann _et al._ analysis. The year‐​over‐​year increase from 2009 to 2010 was the highest annual increase on record. If Chinese coal consumption were having a large impact on global temperature, we would expect that global temperatures would remain suppressed in 2009 and 2010. But the bottom panel in Figure 2 shows what really happened — global temperatures rose in both 2009 and 2010, contrary to the Kaufmann _et al._ hypothesis.







It is clear that natural variability, not sulfate emissions, is the cause of the lack of recent warming. We arrived at this very same conclusion several years ago, however, despite repeated attempts, we were unable to find a journal even interested in _considering_ our work for publication.



Our analysis was remarkably similar to Kaufmann’s:





Our paper (2008):  




The only difference between the manuscripts was Kaufmann’s unsupportable hypothesis that Chinese sulfate emissions also contributed to the lack of warming. 



Our experience with the peer‐​review process was a nightmare that eerily resembles what University of Guelph’s Ross McKitrick describes in his chapter “Bias in the Peer‐​Review Process,” in my new book, _Climate Coup_.



We started with the American Geophysical Union’s (AGU) publication _EOS, Transactions of the American Geophysical Union_. After sitting on the paper for several months (which included getting a review or two), the _EOS_ editors told us that we had too much “new” science in our piece and that _EOS_ was more of a news publication and that they’d be happy to consider publishing a description of our work after it was published elsewhere:



Here is a review that they got concerning our submission:





And here is their final decision:





OK, fine. Since the paper describing our original model (Michaels and Knappenberger, 2000) was published in another AGU publication, _Geophysical Research Letters_ , we figured we submit our new paper there, after expanding the piece from the original _EOS_ submission to a paper more appropriate for _GRL_. In our cover letter to _GRL_ , we included our full set of correspondence with the editors of _EOS_ , and explained how _EOS_ was potentially interested in our findings, but considered there to be too much “new” science for it to be published there. We also included the reviewer’s comments that _Eos_ had obtained (and reproduced above) including “ _Eos_ readership would find the overall argument interesting, especially from the 2nd author.”



Here is what we got back from the _GRL_ editor, one day after submission:





Interesting. Too much new science for one AGU publication, too little for another.



So we turned to a journal which has a section dedicated to short science pieces with broad interest — we reworked our article and submitted it as a Brevia piece to _Science_ magazine. 



A week later we got this:





Well, we figured _Science_ was a long shot.



At the same time, we had received several emails soliciting/​inviting us to submit a paper to a new journal titled _Advance in Meteorology_ — a journal that was looking for content to get it off the ground:





We figured, we had a paper basically ready to go for them. So, we redrafted it to fit the submission guideline to _Advance in Meteorology_ , and sent it off. 



About a week later we got this:





Ok, well, at least we got some scientific feedback, all of which was irrelevant. Our empirical model was built using monthly data over a time period of 20 years, fit the observed temperatures pretty well (the explained variance was about 60%) and it had already been published in _Geophysical Research Letters_. We were merely using it to understand the recent lack of warming. 



Before giving up completely, we thought that we’d give it on more go, this time at the journal _Climate Research_ , where we had published a half dozen or more papers in the past. About a week after submission, we got this response:





Climate Research was the journal that the climategaters particularly hated. They hatched plans to destroy it every time it published something they didn’t like, and I am sure these leaked all over the porous world of climate science. Perhaps their campaign worked. 



We don’t know how to explain the glib acceptance of a very similar paper in the _Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences_ (with the exception of the obviously wrong hypothesis about Chinese sulfates), and our going 0‐​for‐​5. But that is the way it is.

White Coke Cans Fund Polar Bear Myths

Guest post by by Paul Chesser

For years Coca-Cola has given millions of dollars to eco-extreme group World Wildlife Fund, whose alarmism and perpetration of falsehoods are unmatched among its cohorts in climate activism. Now Coke has initiated a new campaign with WWF that features its iconic advertising species in an effort to drive more funding to the international nonprofit group to “protect the polar bears’ Arctic home.”
The promotion will include new packaging for Coke over the holiday season, changing its familiar red cans to white, and featuring an image of a mother polar bear and her cubs on the side. Coke says it will donate $2 million over five years to WWF for “polar bear conservation efforts,” and will also match donations made at iCoke.ca. Last year Coke gave WWF $1.64 million for its various activities globally.

“The planet is changing very quickly, and nowhere more quickly than in the Arctic,” says Gerald Butts, president of WWF-Canada.
“It’s really important that we all understand that they need our help,” he added. “Climate change is changing livelihoods, it’s changing migration patterns for species, and we want to plan ahead. We want a future for the Arctic where the communities of people who live there are vibrant and sustainable, and the iconic species – in particular the polar bear – has a long-term future on the planet.”
Butts speaks so little truth.

Again, forget all the tall tales from IPCC scientist Mojib Latif and Met Office meteorologist David Viner. (Latif has been on the radio trying to convince listeners that the record cold March “is normal”. What a joke.)
Just a couple hours ago, Germany’s leading daily, Bild, which has a circulation in the millions, writes online here that German meteorologist Dominik Jung of wetter.net presents the records for this “seemingly eternally long winter”.
But first, Bild tells its millions of readers in the article (my emphasis):
With regards to the period 1981 to 2010, it was the fifth winter in a row that has been colder than normal, which is in complete contradiction to the climate prognoses of 13 years ago. Back then winters with snow and ice in Germany were viewed as an obsolete model.”
There it is – Germany’s number 1 media outlet tells millions that the climate models are crap! Now some of the records Bild reports on:
– March in Germany will enter the record books as the coldest in 100 years…4°C colder than normal!
– At 28 cm, Hamburg saw the most snow in March since measurements began!
– Dresden saw the lowest temperature for this time of the year since 1917!
– Potsdam, the home of the warming-obsessed PIK, saw the lowest reading for this time of the year since measurements began in 1899!

– Berlin’s high temperature of -3°C was the lowest high for this time of the year in 150 years!
– The first snow fell in the flatlands already on October 26, 2012. For many regions, it was the earliest snowfall on record!
– Nature right now is 4 weeks behind schedule!
– In early March in Northern India an unusual cold spell in the state of Uttar Pradesh led to at least 100 people freezing to death!
– Record snow fell in Moscow – 80 cm!
– In Great Britain, thousands lost power in the relentless cold.
– Kiev, Ukraine saw the most severe snowfall in more than 100 years!

"Even as the coronavirus pandemic terrorizes the world, there’s another global emergency the media can’t afford to stop covering. Fifty years ago this week, the environmental movement staged the first Earth Day demonstration to call attention to environmental degradation and demand reform. In the half century since, climate change has emerged as an existential global threat.  But there are still reasons to be hopeful – and this week, the Guardian is joining forces with hundreds of newsrooms around the world to focus attention on creative solutions to the climate emergency, from electric cars to fighting plastic waste to using psychedelic drugs. (Michael Pollan will weigh in.) We’ll also explore lessons from the coronavirus pandemic – and whether the economic crash could create opportunities to rebuild a greener economy. The Guardian is the lead partner in Covering Climate Now, an initiative founded last year by Columbia Journalism Review and the Nation to address the urgent need for stronger climate coverage. More than 400 newsrooms from around the world – with a combined audience nearing 2 billion people – have signed on. In the coming days, the Covering Climate Now partners will collectively publish hundreds of stories on climate solutions to create a groundswell of hope at a moment when the world feels bleak. Throughout the week, we’ll be sharing Guardian content with CCN partners for republishing, so that even outlets without dedicated environmental reporters can inform their audiences of the dangers of the climate crisis and opportunities for change. Covering Climate Now has provided financial support for some of our climate reporting this week. The Covering Climate Now network represents every corner of the media, from wire services like Reuters and AFP to newspapers like the Times of India and the Christian Science Monitor, and dozens of local and special-interest outlets, across all mediums, from across the US and world. The Guardian has long made climate coverage a top news priority, keeping the story on its front page daily. This year, the Guardian announced it would no longer accept advertising from oil and gas companies, becoming the first major global news organization to institute an outright ban on taking money from companies that extract fossil fuels. Last year, the Guardian updated its style guide to introduce new terms that more accurately describe the environmental crises facing the world. The Guardian now favors the terms “climate crisis” and “climate emergency” over “climate change”. The Guardian last year also began putting global CO2 levels in the daily weather forecast in its print publication. Covering Climate Now was launched to address a glaring failure by the media to meet the urgency of the climate emergency. Kyle Pope, CCN co-founder and publisher of the Columbia Journalism Review, writes that in 2018, “broadcast news outlets gave more airtime to the royal baby than to the warming earth”. In 2019, that started to change. “The climate story seemed to be moving from slow to fast, as the effects of the crisis were becoming impossible for even the most stubborn newsrooms to ignore,” Pope writes. “Floods in Venice and droughts in India were ready-made for the evening news. Devastating fires in California and Australia led news broadcasts around the world. Mass protests and their student leaders adorned magazine covers.” While the project began in the US, Covering Climate Now has quickly gained traction globally and now includes dozens of international news organizations and coverage in multiple languages.

"International cooperation on ozone-depleting chemicals is helping to return the southern jet stream to a normal state after decades of human-caused disruption, a study shows. Scientists say the findings prove there is the capacity to heal some damaged climate systems if governments act promptly and in coordination to deal with the causes.  The southern jet stream is a powerful wind that shapes weather patterns and ocean currents in the southern hemisphere, particularly in the summer. Up until about 2000 it had been shifting from its usual course and moving southwards towards the Antarctic at a rate of one degree of latitude each decade, affecting storm tracks and rainfall over South America, east Africa and Australia. Previous research has shown this was primarily driven by the depletion of the ozone layer by manmade chemical compounds such as chlorofluorocarbons, hydrochlorofluorocarbons, found in fridges, aerosols and other industrial processes. These chemicals, which were used in vast quantities until they started to be phased out under the United Nations 1987 Montreal protocol , thinned the ozone layer, causing a widening “hole” high above the south pole that affected wind patterns. The new paper, published in the journal Nature, shows that the Montreal protocol has paused the southward movement of the jet stream since the turn of the century and may even be starting to reverse it as the ozone hole begins to close. Last September, satellite images revealed the ozone hole annual peak had shrunk to 16.4m sq km, the smallest extent since 1982. “It’s a success story. This is more evidence that the Montreal protocol has led to the recovery of the ozone layer,” said the study’s lead author, Antara Banerjee, who works in the chemical sciences division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and is a visiting fellow at the University of Boulder, Colorado. The expected effect on people will vary from region to region. In Patagonia (southern Chile and Argentina), there should be more rain and less carcinogenic ultra-violet light. The findings will be of more concern for central South America (Uruguay, Paraguay, southern Brazil and northern Argentina), where ozone depletion was previously found to bring more rainfall and wider bands of agricultural production. The same may also be true of east Africa and other desert areas in the mid-latitudes. Previous studies suggest the reversal may also be good news for Australia, which has suffered more drought because the movement of the jet stream pushed rain-bearing storms away from its coast during winter. Whether this is enough to offset the rise in carbon emissions is another matter. The restoration of ozone is not enough to push southern hemisphere weather patterns back on to a normal track because other industrial emissions – such as carbon dioxide and methane – continue to exert a disruptive force in the opposite direction. “There is a tug of war between ozone recovery and increasing CO2. That’s why we are seeing a pause. In the near future, the ozone factor could dominate and the jet stream will move back towards equator. But once the recovery is complete, CO2 could push it southwards again,” Banerjee said. Alexey Karpechko, a reviewer of the paper who works for the Finnish Meteorological Institute, said the paper illustrated how ozone depletion had been the main driver in atmospheric circulation. “This is good news, definitely. It shows our actions can stop climate change,” he said. “We can see coordinated action works. It is a strong message to us as emitters of greenhouse gases. This shows we can manipulate the climate both ways: in a wrong way and by reversing the damage we have done.” Whether this will affect the loss of Antarctic sea ice remains a major unanswered question. Previous studies suggested the ozone hole had a chimney-like effect that sucked some of the heat out of the atmosphere, which meant the south pole warmed more slowly than the north. But Banerjee said such a view was controversial and required further study."

Senator Inhofe’s EPW office issued a press release today on the subject of USHCN Climate Monitoring stations along with links to this report from the General Accounting Office (GAO)
…the report notes, “NOAA does not centrally track whether USHCN stations adhere to siting standards…nor does it have an agency-wide policy regarding stations that don’t meet standards.” The report continues, “Many of the USHCN stations have incomplete temperature records; very few have complete records. 24 of the 1,218 stations (about 2 percent) have complete data from the time they were established.” GAO goes on to state that most stations with long temperature records are likely to have undergone multiple changes in measurement conditions.
The report  shows by their methodology that 42% of the network in 2010 failed to meet siting standards and they have recommendations to NOAA for solving this problem. This number is of course much lower than what we have found in the surfacestations.org survey, but bear in mind that NOAA has been slowly and systematically following my lead and reports and closing the worst stations or removing them from USHCN duty. For example I pointed out that the famous Marysville station (see An old friend put out to pasture: Marysville is no longer a USHCN climate station of record) that started all this was closed just a few months after I reported issues with its atrocious siting. Recent discoveries of closures include Armore (shown below) and Durant OK. This may account for a portion the lower 42% figure for “active stations” the GAO found. Another reason might be that they tended towards using a less exacting rating system than we did.
Recently, while resurveying stations that I previously surveyed in Oklahoma, I discovered that NOAA has been quietly removing the temperature sensors from some of the USHCN stations we cited as the worst (CRN4, 5) offenders of siting quality. For example, here are before and after photographs of the USHCN temperature station in Ardmore, OK, within a few feet of the traffic intersection at City Hall:
Ardmore USHCN station , MMTS temperature sensor, January 2009 

Ardmore USHCN station , MMTS temperature sensor removed, March 2011
While NCDC has gone to great lengths to defend the quality of the USHCN network, their actions of closing them speak far louder than written words and peer reviewed publications.
I don’t have time today to go into detail, but will follow up at another time. Here is the GAO summary:
Climate Monitoring: NOAA Can Improve Management of the U.S. Historical Climatology Network
GAO-11-800 August 31, 2011
Highlights Page (PDF)   Full Report (PDF, 47 pages)   Accessible Text   Recommendations (HTML)
Summary
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) maintains a network of weather-monitoring stations known as the U.S. Historical Climatology Network (USHCN), which monitors the nation’s climate and analyzes long-term surface temperature trends. Recent reports have shown that some stations in the USHCN are not sited in accordance with NOAA’s standards, which state that temperature instruments should be located away from extensive paved surfaces or obstructions such as buildings and trees. GAO was asked to examine (1) how NOAA chose stations for the USHCN, (2) the extent to which these stations meet siting standards and other requirements, and (3) the extent to which NOAA tracks USHCN stations’ adherence to siting standards and other requirements and has established a policy for addressing nonadherence to siting standards. GAO reviewed data and documents, interviewed key NOAA officials, surveyed the 116 NOAA weather forecast offices responsible for managing stations in the USHCN, and visited 8 forecast offices.
In choosing USHCN stations from a larger set of existing weather-monitoring stations, NOAA placed a high priority on achieving a relatively uniform geographic distribution of stations across the contiguous 48 states. NOAA balanced geographic distribution with other factors, including a desire for a long history of temperature records, limited periods of missing data, and stability of a station’s location and other measurement conditions, since changes in such conditions can cause temperature shifts unrelated to climate trends. NOAA had to make certain exceptions, such as including many stations that had incomplete temperature records. In general, the extent to which the stations met NOAA’s siting standards played a limited role in the designation process, in part because NOAA officials considered other factors, such as geographic distribution and a long history of records, to be more important. USHCN stations meet NOAA’s siting standards and management requirements to varying degrees. According to GAO’s survey of weather forecast offices, about 42 percent of the active stations in 2010 did not meet one or more of the siting standards.
With regard to management requirements, GAO found that the weather forecast offices had generally but not always met the requirements to conduct annual station inspections and to update station records. NOAA officials told GAO that it is important to annually visit stations and keep records up to date, including siting conditions, so that NOAA and other users of the data know the conditions under which they were recorded. NOAA officials identified a variety of challenges that contribute to some stations not adhering to siting standards and management requirements, including the use of temperature-measuring equipment that is connected by a cable to an indoor readout device–which can require installing equipment closer to buildings than specified in the siting standards. NOAA does not centrally track whether USHCN stations adhere to siting standards and the requirement to update station records, and it does not have an agencywide policy regarding stations that do not meet its siting standards. Performance management guidelines call for using performance information to assess program results. NOAA’s information systems, however, are not designed to centrally track whether stations in the USHCN meet its siting standards or the requirement to update station records. Without centrally available information, NOAA cannot easily measure the performance of the USHCN in meeting siting standards and management requirements.
Furthermore, federal internal control standards call for agencies to document their policies and procedures to help managers achieve desired results. NOAA has not developed an agencywide policy, however, that clarifies for agency staff whether stations that do not adhere to siting standards should remain open because the continuity of the data is important, or should be moved or closed. As a result, weather forecast offices do not have a basis for making consistent decisions to address stations that do not meet the siting standards. GAO recommends that NOAA enhance its information systems to centrally capture information useful in managing the USHCN and develop a policy on how to address stations that do not meet its siting standards. NOAA agreed with GAO’s recommendations.

The European Energy Review has a review of Dieter Helm’s new book “The Carbon Crunch“, read here (scroll down to: Dieter Helm’s new thriller separates climate fiction from fact). 
According to the EER, Helm is one of the most famous energy economists in Europe – a professor of energy policy at the University of Oxford and a fellow in Economics at New College, Oxford. He has also served as special advisor to the UK government and to the European Commission.
It’s another recently published book criticizing climate science and policy by a high profile author in Europe.
EER writes (emphasis added):
Dieter Helm’s new book “The Carbon Crunch” reads a bit like a detective novel. It is about ‘who killed climate policy’. And how we can revive the corpse.
He starts his story with the stark observation that international climate policy, led by the EU as self-styled climate frontrunner, is an outright failure. The endless UN climate conferences and the famous Kyoto treaty are not delivering the goods. Neither is the EU Emission Trading Scheme. Moreover, what is worse, climate as a public concern is sliding down the political agenda. Clearly, something must be done – and done quickly – to stave off disaster.
Well, disaster? Is climate change really the threat that many people say it is? Helm notes that the public has become more sceptical in this regard – or more fatalistic, with the same effect. To his credit, he does not blame the “climate sceptics” or ExxonMobil for this. On the contrary, ‘green’ NGO’s and climate scientists deserve a lot of the blame, as they are frequently guilty of alarmist predictions and pretending to be certain about inherently uncertain things.”
So like Hans von Storch, Dieter Helm is also convinced that climate policy is dead and that the science is hyped up.
On solar and wind projects in Europe as a solution to pollution by coal, Helm tells us the policies to promote renewable energies  (sun and wind) have been a disaster:

google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




This is so much money wasted. These policies allow European politicians to grandstand about how brilliantly Europe is limiting its emissions, but they do not have any significant effect on the climate.
Grandstanding? Isn’t that precisely what Obama wants to do now? He may want to reconsider about getting in on the folly.
And Helm tells us how that Europe is cheating with its carbon bookkeeping:
The EU may be limiting its emissions from carbon production, but this is because European industrial production has shifted to a considerable extent to Asia – and the EU does of course import Asian products for its consumption. So what really counts is not so much carbon production, but carbon consumption. In the UK, for example, notes Helm, carbon production went down 15% between 1990 and 2005, but carbon consumption went up 19%!”
Helm, a warmist, also admits that going green does mean pain, and there is no denying it. EER writes…
Helm is at least honest enough not to pretend that climate policy is somehow going to be effective without economic sacrifices. Any solution will hurt, no matter how much politicians prattle about “green growth”.  […] Whether political leaders will be able to persuade people to shed ‘blood, sweat and tears’ in this cause, is the big question. They could at least start by reading this book.”

"Air pollution may have fallen since the 1970s, but it remains a major health risk in the UK. More than 2.6m schoolchildren nationwide are exposed to dangerous levels. Exposure to toxic gases and particulate matter shortens the lives of more than 30,000 citizens a year, and costs the NHS millions. Increases in public awareness of these health effects, triggered in part by the death of schoolgirl Ella Kissi-Debrah and Volkswagen’s “dieselgate” scandal, have spurred the UK government to make the quality of the country’s air a priority concern. As part of this, the government’s recently published comprehensive long-term strategy for clean air aims to eliminate wood- and coal-burning stoves from 2022 and sets ambitious targets to reduce harmful emissions – although concrete short-term action has yet to be taken. Now, government agency Public Health England has recommended some promising solutions to tackle air pollution here and now. But one key aspect of its proposals – a sustained anti-idling campaign – is not fully thought through. On the surface, turning off your engine whenever waiting in a car – be it when picking the kids up from school, or stuck in a traffic jam – seems like a sensible idea. When an engine is switched off, it doesn’t emit anything. However, the full story is more complex.

      Fact Check: are diesel cars really more polluting than petrol cars?


 Petrol vehicles made after 1993 have catalysts (often known as catalytic converters) fitted to their exhausts. These are devices that convert harmful exhaust emissions, such as unburned fuel, oxides of nitrogen, and carbon monoxide, into harmless gases. Since 2017, most diesel cars have been fitted with the latest iteration of these catalysts, to neutralise the particularly high level of air pollutants that older cars emitted. But such catalysts require engine heat to function – every minute an engine is switched off takes them further away from their ideal operating temperature, and they do not work at all when cold. Thus, while anti-idling campaigns may help cut levels of climate pollutants not captured by catalysts, such as carbon dioxide, they pose a real risk of unintended immediate harm to human health. Using a petrol-powered 2011 Ford Fusion as an example, the US Department of Energy showed that restarting a warm engine emits 4.5 times more hydrocarbon gases, 19 times more nitrogen oxides, and 390 times more carbon monoxide than 30 seconds of idling. Restarting a cold engine is even worse, emitting nearly 1,000 times more carbon monoxide and 760 times more nitrogen oxides than idling for half a minute. According to these figures, you could leave the engine running for ten minutes before emitting as much nitrogen oxide as if you had switched off and restarted the engine. For carbon monoxide, the figure is nearly eight hours. And that’s before even considering particulates, particularly harmful carcinogens that can cause acute respiratory effects, and which are emitted in high quantities during engine starts. Thanks to a lag in regulations, most modern petrol cars on UK roads today are not fitted with particulate filters, making restarts of these vehicles particularly problematic.  It’s true that leaving your car running will increase planet-warming CO₂ emissions – but not by as much as you might think. For the example above, roughly six minutes of idling produces the same amount of CO₂ as driving one kilometre. This seems a small price to pay to preserve the health of the children you’re picking up from school, or pedestrians walking the streets. Of course, it’s important to note that these data are based on just one car. Surprisingly, there is only one existing study on this issue. But as an expert in vehicle emissions, there is no reason to assume that other petrol cars would behave any differently. The UK government’s post-“dieselgate” switch to demonising the diesel engine – now no more polluting than petrol equivalents – left owners confused and out of pocket, and resulted in vehicle CO₂ emissions increasing in 2017 for the first time in two decades. London’s Ultra Low Emissions Zone further penalises drivers who bought older diesel cars thinking they were greener, while allowing unlimited deadly particulate emissions from petrol cars and motorbikes. Now, on current evidence, Public Health England’s advice to curb car idling may actually dirty the country’s air, not clean it. If the government is to avoid further loss of trust and harm to health, clear, confident and, most importantly, accurate messaging is now essential for keeping the public on board with tackling air pollution. Substantial research testing more vehicles is urgently needed to enable effective policy-making on car-idling. Until then, if you want to cut air pollution, you might be better off ignoring the government and leaving your engine running. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter.

Breakthrough in hydrogen fuel cells
USC chemists develop way to safely store, extract hydrogen
A team of USC scientists has developed a robust, efficient method of using hydrogen as a fuel source.
Hydrogen makes a great fuel because of it can easily be converted to electricity in a fuel cell and because it is carbon free. The downside of hydrogen is that, because it is a gas, it can only be stored in high pressure or cryogenic tanks.
In a vehicle with a tank full of hydrogen, “if you got into a wreck, you’d have a problem,” said Travis Williams, assistant professor of chemistry at the USC Dornsife College.

A possible solution is to store hydrogen in a safe chemical form. Earlier this year, Williams and his team figured out a way to release hydrogen from an innocuous chemical material — a nitrogen-boron complex, ammonia borane — that can be stored as a stable solid.
Now the team has developed a catalyst system that releases enough hydrogen from its storage in ammonia borane to make it usable as a fuel source. Moreover, the system is air-stable and re-usable, unlike other systems for hydrogen storage on boron and metal hydrides.
The research was published this month in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.
“Ours is the first game in town for reusable, air stabile ammonia borane dehydrogenation,” Williams said, adding that the USC Stevens Institute is in the process of patenting the system.
The system is sufficiently lightweight and efficient to have potential fuel applications ranging from motor-driven cycles to small aircraft, he said.

The research was funded by the Hydrocarbon Research Foundation and the National Science Foundation.

Do you remember when Jacinda promised no more taxes at the 2017 election? Now we have additional fuel taxes, tourist levies and an extended Bright Line test, just to mention a few.



Well, it is not over yet.



The Government is signalling its intention to slash the price of imported electric and hybrid vehicles by up to $8000 in a bid to make greener cars cheaper for Kiwis.  
But it is also planning to slap a new fee of up to $3000 on the import of vehicles with the highest greenhouse gas emissions.  
The Government has today opened a six-week consultation period before it introduces new legislation in Parliament later this year.  
The plan, according to Associate Transport Minister Julie Anne Genter, will get more Kiwis into cleaner vehicles by reducing some of the cost burden. 



So they are proposing discounts for people who buy EVs or hybrids, even though those people are generally better off and more likely to be able to afford the full price. This is just more middle class welfare as far as I can see.



But wait! There’s more… 



For example, a new Hyundai Ioniq – which has an approximate retail value of just under $60,000 – would cost $52,000 after the full $8000 discount. 



A used Mazda Axela, which is one of New Zealand’s most popular imported vehicles, would cost $7200 after an $800 discount.  
 **But a new Land Rover Sports V8 would be slapped with a $3000 high-emissions fee.**  
A $22,000 Toyota Hiace would cost an extra $1400 after the fee was applied. 



Another slap in the face for rural New Zealand… not to mention tradespeople, and anyone who has to travel any distance (such as salespeople) or tow anything… ever.



Genter said the policy would be cost neutral – meaning the money gained through the fees from higher emitting vehicles would offset the subsidies provided to the lower emission cars.



That is her sop to people who complain about giving discounts to the wealthy, but it is still unacceptable. If you can afford an EV, at a cost of about $70,000, then you can damn well pay for it yourself. I don’t see why I should subsidise it.



“This means people will still have choice, while contributing to the task of cleaning up the vehicles coming into New Zealand.” 



  
Under a government that promised no new taxes (read my lips), this is yet another tax. They may be denying it, but that is what it is. A tax on non-electric vehicles.



We won’t mention at this point that electric vehicles have a bigger carbon footprint than a petrol or diesel vehicle at the manufacturing stage, because they are climate Nazis and there is no point. No one in this government, particularly in the Greens, is going to want to hear anything like that, even if it is true.



I really do think, however, that this could be the undoing of this government. 



New Zealand cities are small by world standards, and even most city dwellers like to get out and about at the weekends – go to the beach, go bush walking, go skiing, take the boat out. This means that almost all recreational activities are going to be subject, sooner or later, to this environmental tax.



Large numbers of New Zealanders live outside the cities, in small towns or rural areas, and for them, EVs are useless. 



What if you are a tradesperson who needs a van to use for work? What if you do a round trip of 40 kms each day to work? What if you are a farmer? A digger driver? A construction worker? A cleaner who needs to go to numerous locations? A building inspector?



What if you live in Manurewa, work in Newmarket at a cleaning job that pays $18 per hour? How are you going to fund an EV?



In other words, if you are a soy latte drinking city dwelling office worker, you’ll be sweet. Everyone else – also known as the backbone of New Zealand – is going to be penalised for needing to use a work vehicle. 



This government seems to be hellbent on destroying all of our primary and secondary industries… and they wonder why business confidence is through the floor?



This could be this government’s ‘shower head and lightbulb’ moment. Imposing further taxes on vehicles that people need to use for work, while giving discounts to those who never will is economic lunacy. 



Please, please, please pass this into law, Julie-Ann Genter. It won’t apply until 2021. At the next election, both National and ACT can campaign on getting rid of this tax and the government will be exposed for the economic jihadists that they really are. The voters can then tell them what they think at the ballot box.

While the GAO issues a report today saying that the US Historical Climatological Monitoring Network has real tangible problems (as I have been saying for years) the Inspector General just released a report this week saying that EPA rushed their CO2 endangerment finding, skipping annoying steps like doing proper review. The lone man holding up his hand at the EPA saying “wait a minute” was Alan Carlin, who was excoriated for doing so.
From Powerline Blog:
Here’s a refresher: in 2009, when the EPA announced its “endangerment” finding to justify its planned regulation of greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act, Alan Carlin, a 35-year veteran EPA employee who ran the EPA’s National Center for Environmental Economics, produced a 98-page critique of the climate science the EPA used in its finding.  Carlin’s report concluded, “We believe our concerns and reservations are sufficiently important to warrant a serious review of the science by the EPA.”
You can guess what happened next.  The Obama Administration, the one supposedly dedicated to transparency and “restoring science” in public policy making, squashed Carlin’s report and told him to cease and desist any further analysis on climate change issues.  Carlin’s supervisor (a political appointee) emailed his: “I don’t want you to spend any additional EPA time on climate change.  No papers, no research, etc.”  Shortly after this episode Carlin left EPA.  (By the way, Carlin was the chairman of the Los Angeles chapter of the Sierra Club in California at one time, and helped with the Sierra Club’s campaign to stop two dam projects back in the 1960s.  In other words, he’s no right-wing ideologue, as the smears of the climate campaigners would have you think.)
This story is relevant again this week not simply for the obvious hypocrisy and double standard (insert the old joke about liberals and double-standards here), but because the issue of the EPA’s climate science has resurfaced in the form of an EPA inspector general’s report that essentially says that Carlin was right about the EPA’s shoddy scientific review.  Here’s the New York Times account from Wednesday:
In a report with wide-reaching political implications, U.S. EPA’s inspector general has found that the scientific assessment backing U.S. EPA’s finding that greenhouse gases are dangerous did not go through sufficient peer review for a document of its importance. . .
According to the IG report, EPA failed to follow the Office of Management and Budget’s peer review procedures for a “highly influential scientific assessment,” which is defined as an assessment that could have an impact of more than $500 million in one year and is “novel, controversial, or precedent setting.”
In particular, the document was reviewed by a 12-member panel that included an EPA employee, violating rules on neutrality. EPA also did not make the review results public, as required, or certify whether it complied with internal or OMB requirements.
In a statement, IG Arthur Elkins Jr. emphasized that his office “did not test the validity of the scientific or technical information used to support the endangerment finding.”
“While it may be debatable what impact, if any, this had on EPA’s finding, it is clear that EPA did not follow all required steps for a highly influential scientific assessment,” he said.
Roger Pielke Jr. observes how the climate campaigners are all circling the wagons, saying “move along, nothing to see here,” and noting that “I’d speculate that these observers would have had different reactions had this report been requested by Henry Waxman in 2006 about the last administration’s EPA. . .   during the Bush Administration concern about processes to ensure scientific integrity were all the rage. At that time it was generally understood that process matters, not simply because it helps to improve the quality of scientific assessments, but also because it helps to establish their legitimacy in the political process.  One sneers at process at some risk.”

=============================================================
I’m proud to say that Alan used materials from WUWT in his report, and that he has been vindicated for standing up to the sloppy rush job.
Thank you Mr. Carlin, for having integrity where others did not.
UPDATE: Climatologist Pat Michaels sums up the whole affair pretty well at Forbes: The EPA’s Endangerment Finding Is Very Endangered

 **Too Right**  
A regular column by John Black[  
The Black Sheep Blog  
](https://theblacksheepblognz.blogspot.com/)[Rightminds](https://www.rightminds.nz/)



In the great works of dystopic fiction, _1984, Brave New World,_ and _Robo Cop 3: He’s Back To Lay Down The Law,_ the state looms large as the enemy of liberty. It is not mere coincidence that parts of the world deprived of the influence of these seminal works either through censorship or in the case of _Robocop3_ , terrible sound dubbing, have seen state power at its most intrusive. The absence of fictional examples of the totalitarian nightmare smooths the way for the real thing. Myanmar which banned _1984_ until recently, still has a ‘Ministry of Information’ that could well have been modelled on the ‘Ministry of Truth’ in Orwell’s novel. China’s ‘One Child’ policy has been as restrictive of human reproductive freedom as anything found in _Brave New World_.



And Philippines’ President Rodrigo Duterte thinks he actually is _Robocop._



These fictions are but part of a larger cultural inheritance characteristic of Western Civilization: the concern for personal liberty.



Just why this obsession developed solely in the West is much in dispute, but the argument with the most weight is also the least fashionable.



Religion.



Or at least our particular brand of it.



In just two years the Chinese government plans to have 400 million cameras trained on its own citizens. Social infractions caught on camera or passed on by informers will be compiled and used as the basis for a system of ‘Social Credit’. In China, the desire to play the Bee Gees at high volume at 3 am on a Tuesday morning would have repercussions beyond questions of musical taste. You could find yourself blacklisted from public transport, unable to get a bank loan or even a job. That’s a high price to pay for ‘How Deep Is Your Love’. 



The influence of Confucian authoritarianism means that in China the state defines personal virtue – a tendency that has flourished under sixty odd years of Communism. In the West, however, personal conscience has often developed _contra_ the state, through the competing claims of temporal and spiritual authority that has marked the development of Christianity. When your King and your Pope can’t agree on who the real boss is, you may well decide you are. **That restraints on personal behaviour should come from within rather than without has been the ideal in the Judeo-Christian West.**



However, the current threat to this glorious Western tradition of personal liberty comes not from the state but from our fellow citizens, through the madness that is ‘Social Media’. 



Today, the power of the established churches is ebbing and personal religious belief is fast evaporating, but in their place has come a new dogma preached by a new clergy and with its own heresies. The spectacle of a Social Justice Warrior in a flight of Twitterian outrage evokes the hellfire preachers of the past, spewing their sulphurous sermons at a glassy-eyed congregation. 



This ‘woke’ cadre of metropolitan mind meddlers patrol their flock on the lookout for thought-crime with every inch the sanctimonious authority of their clerical brothers and sisters of ages past. 



Late last year across the ditch _The Herald Sun_ ’s cartoonist Mark Knight had the inquisitorial thumb screws applied. Doing nothing but his job, to caricature humanity through exaggeration and artful distortion, Mr Knight, when drawing the tennis star Serena Williams managed to provoke one of the high priestesses of the woke elite. 



J.K Rowling, perhaps at a loose end after selling her 20 million dollar yacht replete with five bedrooms and a home cinema, took the time to accuse Mr Knight’s cartoon of two of the new seven deadly sins, Racism and Sexism (The others in case you are wondering are the three ‘phobias’, homo, trans and Islamo, plus ableism and climate scepticism). 



A social media ‘mob’ acts with about as much restraint as ‘the mob’, their horse’s-head-in-the-bed is the attempt to get you fired. More recently Rugby player Israel Folau was asked a question and gave an honest answer. The mistake he made was giving it on Instagram. Believing that sinners of all persuasions face eternal punishment just doesn’t wash with the bien pensants. Thanks to the hysterical reaction online and his admirable refusal to back down, the man has had his livelihood taken from him. As his most vociferous critics are avowed atheists the only Hell they are really concerned with here is the one they are trying to put him and his wife through. 



As Edmund Burke wrote and Mr Knight and Mr Folau no doubt felt, ‘The tyranny of a multitude is a multiplied tyranny.’



The authoritarian state of China, zealously rooting out all dissent, is unnecessary in the West; through social media the populace is doing an excellent job of ridding itself of heterodox opinion. 



**It is beyond ironic that online platforms designed for the expression of opinions have so heartily amplified the tendency to repress them.** Freedom of speech and expression is dying at the very point in time when we have the greatest means to speak and express our ideas.



So what can be done? A cultural rearming using the classic works in defence of liberty? Sure, I’d like to recommend Milton’s _Areopagitica_ , but I can’t pronounce the thing.



I prefer a quicker more radical solution: A voluntary disengagement from all social media. Millennials seem to be up for it. Frustrated by data mining and constant marketing, they are deleting their Facebook accounts in droves. Twitter, once as popular with millennials as overly manicured beards and vaping, has lost 100 million daily ’tweeters’ in six years. 



Let’s make the next popular ‘hashtag’ retweeted around the twittersphere, the very last. One that will bring the whole edifice of browbeating, conformist, finger-wagging social media down. Humanity’s kiss-off to an experiment that only did us harm. A clarion call to once more retreat into our shells, free to think and act how we wish. A rebirth of mind-your-own-bloody business and an end to #thatsracist, #staywoke and #metoo.



Goodbye Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and the rest. 



#mefree.

When any discussion sinks to the level of attacking the person rather than the topic or issue at hand, it is a sign that the attacker has lost. When their position is so weak that debating the facts cannot convince their opponent, an _ad hominem_ attack is a resort of the feeble.



 _ **Ad hominem**_ (Latin for “to the person”), short for _argumentum ad hominem_ , typically refers to a fallacious argumentative strategy whereby genuine discussion of the topic at hand is avoided by instead attacking the character, motive, or other attribute of the person making the argument, or persons associated with the argument, rather than attacking the substance of the argument itself. 



Fallacious ad hominem reasoning is categorized among informal fallacies, more precisely as a genetic fallacy, a subcategory of **fallacies of irrelevance**.



  
Thus, all you right-wing authoritarian, socially dominant, sexist, racist ‘climate deniers’ are the problem!



Asserting dominance over nature is a driving factor among **climate denying conservatives** , a new study has found.



Has anyone ever met a conservative who denies the climate?



Researchers from Victoria University of Wellington and the University of Canberra in Australia identified two “types” of conservative people who **place less importance on climate change and the environment** – socially dominant and right-wing authoritarians.



Two totally different topics are lumped together here. Care for the environment, fresh water, clean air, supporting Kiwi breeding programmes, looking after Blue Penguins or whatever is the “environment” and most ‘conservative’ people are well into these issues and concerns.



‘Climate change’, however you define it, is a whole different ball of wax.



Surveying 22,966 people over five years, they found both types had “lower willingness to make sacrifices for the environment over time”, but the socially dominant types were stronger climate change deniers.



If authoritarian right-wingers were not willing to buy an EV and pay more money as a ‘sacrifice’ to climate change, were they immediately categorised as unwilling to care for the environment?



Socially dominant types were defined as those who want a structured hierarchy in society, while right-wing authoritarians were those with a preference to conform to authority figures and punish those who oppose.



So what did they think about climate change? Put simply, they weren’t fans of making changes.



Despite the overwhelming scientific consensus on climate change and its likely impacts, social dominants often viewed the whole issue as something that would never affect them – they thought they were “immune” to it.



They thought that issues such as rising sea levels, that are already threatening various Pacific Island nations, weren’t likely to directly affect them, so they weren’t too worried about it.



Considering that Pacific Island atolls are growing in size, not shrinking, and average sea level rise, as measured by the [76 global tide](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468013319300567) gauges with records over 100 years and no data quality issues, is currently 0.337mm/year – not being ‘too worried about it’ seems quite reasonable. 



[…] This endorsement and acceptance of social inequality connected to behaviours such as sexism and racism, the study said. 



That sentence makes as much sense as the study the journalist is reporting on!



Social dominants were also found to be accepting of environmental degradation, if it benefited high-status social groups.



Because they wanted power over lower groups, be it other people or nature as a whole, this group was difficult to reach in terms of environmental education. The authors of the study said it would be important to stress that the social hierarchy isn’t threatened by environmental action, in order to reach this group.



Authoritarian types were also considered to be difficult to reach, as they tended to view the conversation surrounding climate change and the environment as “overstated”.



“[Right-wing authoritarian] was related to statements that conceptualise environmental issues as overstated, environmental action as detrimental to the country, and environmentalists as deserving of punishment.”



Researchers explained those who endorse this conservative view were “less likely to assume responsibility for acting on global warming, or intention to mitigate the problem”. […]



  
 **Perhaps they merely switched their brains on and thought for themselves?** Perhaps the socially dominant, right-wing authoritarian conservatives can see through the man-made global warming, climate change, climate catastrophe, climate emergency, tax and control scam? 



Interestingly, no journalist was prepared to own up to writing this nonsense.

"**The rate that coronavirus is being transmitted in the community has been watched keenly by health officials.**
It remained steady for weeks but then fell dramatically, compared to what it was at its peak during lockdown, before starting to go up again.
As of 20 November, the so-called R number was estimated to be between 0.8 and 1 in Wales and advisory body Sage was confident it was below 1. But First Minister Mark Drakeford said it could be as high as 1.4, at a briefing a week later.
It was two or three times that earlier in the pandemic.
The R rate is the average number a sick person could pass the virus on to.
Health Minister Vaughan Gething, said the rate needs to drop below 1 for case numbers to begin falling.
""The measures we have put in place at both a local and a national level to date have helped to keep the spread of the virus under check,"" he said.
""But there is growing concern these will not be enough to help us through the winter because the virus is spreading so quickly.
""We could see coronavirus infections reach the same level as the spring peak in just a couple of weeks.""
It tells us how many people are likely to get infected from a person who is ill with coronavirus.
So if the R number is R2 - it means a sick person is likely to transmit the virus to two other people. This is how coronavirus spreads.
The lower the number the better - and under one is the aim. As restrictions are lifted, it leads to the R number rising.
So if R is 1 then on average 10 people infected with Covid-19 would pass it on to another 10 people.
But if R is 0.8 then on average 10 people who have caught coronavirus would pass it on to eight others, and so on.
When tThe Welsh Government's scientific advisory group published its data a week after the end of the 17-day firebreak lockdown on 13 November, it estimated a figure between 0.9 and 1.2, down from 1 and 1.3.
As of 20 November, the so-called R number was estimated to be between 0.8 and 1 in Wales and UK advisory body Sage was confident it was below 1.
But First Minister Mark Drakeford said it could be as high as 1.4 when he gave his briefing on 27 November.
Scientists say the R number is useful when coronavirus cases are going up or down but with a low numbers of cases - as over the summer - it was hard to get a good handle on what was happening.
So the lower the number of positive cases, the less useful it is.
But now with cases rising, the R-number and growth rate are seen as more reliable tools again.
This is also why it is also unreliable to try to estimate a R-number for different regions of Wales.
The Welsh Government's Technical Advisory Cell (Tac) said a low number of cases also means the R number ""becomes very sensitive to daily changes"" in cases found through tracing, causing it to fluctuate weekly.
The R-number plays into a number of ""circuit-breaker"" tests, which health officials and scientists are looking at.
The **growth rate**. This is falling and the Sage scientific group estimates a growth rate of between -0.04 and 0.00 in Wales, indicating that infections could be stable or falling by between 0& and -4% and 0% per day.
Meanwhile, it has been estimated that 16,400 people in Wales had Covid-19 in the week to 21 November.
Analysis of thousands of **swab results** in a survey by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) means it can estimate that about one in 185 people in Wales had the virus.
The R number in Wales is worked out by looking at eight different data sources - and it is then a weighted average of estimates.
This includes data from hospitalisations, confirmed cases, deaths and data from contact surveys, which includes a Welsh sample.
The Tac group says the **case rate figures** give an early indication that numbers of confirmed Covid cases per day are reducing.
""This reduction in case numbers is encouraging, but should be treated with caution as this could a result of many factors, including different testing patterns and behaviours due to current restrictions,"" it said.
It said positivity rates had fallen but remain high across Wales, and **hospital occupancy** was similar to the April peak.
In September, a ""reasonable worst case scenario"" was published, after what could happen over the winter and into next spring was modelled by experts at Swansea University.
The worst case looked at 636,000 infections, leading to 18,200 hospital admissions - peaking in January - and potentially 6,300 deaths.
Earlier in the pandemic, the scientific advisers suggested an R of 0.8 would lead to 500 additional coronavirus deaths by the start of August and as many 7,000 if the R number reached 1.1.
Initial estimates earlier in May suggested R 0.8 would lead to 800 more deaths and 7,200 if the rate hit 1.1.
Tac said in its recent report that a consistent R number below 1 would lead to a reduction in cases and hospitalisations, while a consistent R number above 1 would lead to a rise.
But they warn that a small increase in R above 1, maintained for three months, could have a ""huge impact"" on hospital demand and ""greatly increase"" the number of hospital admissions and deaths.
**What else are the experts saying?**
The Sage group of UK scientific advisers is also looking at the speed and how quickly infections are changing each day.
Analysis of data and surveys showing other trends suggested those who reported using a face covering increased further to 82%, whilst those in Wales who said they made essential trips only rose from 38% to 51% - the highest it has been since early July.
Mobility data for Wales also shows how lockdowns have changed behaviour \- where we travel to, including trips to work and shops.
Tac reported that all the data showed ""very large falls after the firebreak started - with mobility back to levels last seen in May in some cases"".
But since the firebreak ended mobility has returned to levels seen before the two-week lockdown.
Tac has also been looking at potential pitfalls from bringing in local lockdowns, with a ""lack of motivation"" likely without furlough support."
"**It is ""all but certain"" the Isle of Man's border will remain closed to non-residents in December to ensure the island enjoys ""a Covid-free Christmas"", the chief minister has said.**
Howard Quayle said the infection rate in the UK remained too high to relax the restrictions.
He added the decision, which will mean family members overseas cannot visit, had ""weighed heavily"" on ministers.
The island's border is currently closed to almost all non-residents.
Mr Quayle said the decision would cause some ""unease"", but there was ""a clear collective will in our community to maintain the status quo and keep the virus from spreading across our island this December"".
Maintaining the border closure would mean that for ""the vast majority"" of residents, Christmas would be ""normal in many more ways than we had dared hope for earlier in the year"", he said.
He added that the situation would be reviewed ""on a regular basis"".
Mr Quayle's comment come as a charity announced it will pay for accommodation for students returning to the island for Christmas to self-isolate, to ensure their families do not have to.
A total of 369 people on the island have tested positive for Covid-19 since March.
Six cases remain active, four of which are part of a coronavirus cluster linked to a person who returned to the island from north-west England.

If recent reports are accurate, President Barack Obama will make a final decision on the beleaguered Keystone XL pipeline “in a couple of months,” but don’t hold your breath. A recent ruling in a Nebraska court and a still‐​open public comment period at the State Department promise lengthy delays. The “couple of months” refrain has been used before. While the president could very well make a decision, he has no reason to, as he is setting the board in a way that he doesn’t have to touch Keystone for the rest of his presidency.



While he hasn’t moved to counter the bad publicity heaped on the pipeline, the president has cut the permitting time for natural gas export facilities. In this way, he is keeping both job creation proponents and environmental protectionists happy, allowing him to vacillate on Keystone without ever having to face the negatives that will come with any decision.



The president’s strategic play — straight out of his Climate Action Plan — runs afoul of the science and economic benefits behind the pipeline, but is a winner when it comes to the politics.



The expansion of natural gas has a greater, more diverse and more widespread economic impact than Keystone XL. Estimates of permanent jobs once the pipeline is up and running are only in the low hundreds.



Expanding domestic natural gas production, on the other hand, is a boost to mining operators, transporters and refiners, and it supports a build‐​out of infrastructure along the way — with the money primarily changing hands in the United States. Speeding up natural gas permitting then is a perfect way to quiet the jobs lobby. From an environmental standpoint, the preference for “clean” natural gas over so‐​called “dirty” oil from the Canadian tar sands fits perfectly with the president’s continued push for measures to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. But since China annually increases its carbon dioxide emissions by many more times than we could ever hope to reduce ours, the math and science behind the president’s efforts proves them to be ineffective. But this takes a backseat to the appearance of at least “doing something” about climate change.





When it comes to Keystone XL, facts don’t seem to matter – what is dictating policy is environmental alarmism.



On a recent trip to Indonesia, Secretary of State John Kerry called the dangers of a changing climate “perhaps the world’s most fearsome weapon of mass destruction.” The president didn’t waste much time in piling on, linking the risks of climate change to the pipeline during a visit to Mexico last week. Such talk is designed to appease green groups. Last week, these groups reiterated that presidential approval of the pipeline would be unforgivable and would result in a “vehement reaction.”



This rhetoric is way over the top. Increasingly, scientific findings are published that suggest that the Earth’s climate is less sensitive to carbon dioxide emissions than is widely recognized, which means fewer, and less negative, impacts. When it comes to Keystone XL, the oil carried through the pipeline between now and the end of the century would add less than 0.001 degrees Celsius of extra global warming — which surely meets the president’s definition of “negligible,” a criteria he has put forward for his approval of the pipeline. Furthermore, in its recently completed review, the State Department concluded that the overall environmental risk from the pipeline is low and manageable.



Unfortunately, when it comes to Keystone XL, facts don’t seem to matter — what is dictating policy is environmental alarmism. That’s why the pipeline’s permitting process has been drawn out for more than five years and counting.



This all points to a slow, painful death for the Keystone XL pipeline — a death not at the hands of good science, but rather from political gamesmanship.

 _The Current Wisdom_ is a series of monthly articles in which Senior Fellow Patrick J. Michaels reviews interesting items on global warming in the scientific literature that may not have received the media attention that they deserved, or have been misinterpreted in the popular press.



Traditionally _The Current Wisdom_ only comments on science appearing in the refereed, peer‐​reviewed literature, or that has been peer‐​screened prior to presentation at a scientific congress. In this case we are building off of a summary of that literature published about satellite‐​sensed temperatures, the only truly global record that there is, and the only one that cannot suffer from the problem of urban (warming) bias.



Prior to April, 2011, issues of this _Wisdom_ , which began in 2010, are available at our blog Cato@Liberty (www​.cato​-at​-lib​er​ty​.org/).





It has been 33 years now that satellites have carried Microwave Sounding Units (MSU) capable of measuring the temperature of the lower levels of the atmosphere. These instruments take advantage of the fact that the vibration of the diatomic bond in common oxygen (O2) is proportional to temperature.



The pioneering work of taking the raw MSU observations and developing a temperature record that could be used in climate studies was first done by Roy Spencer and John Christy, then of NASA and University of Alabama‐​Huntsville, whose joint paper in Science magazine back in 1990 introduced the world to this novel atmospheric temperature dataset. Spencer and Christy have continued to extend and improve this important work ever since.



One of the great characteristics of the satellite MSU measurements is that they do not suffer from many of the ills that thermometric measurements taken from the earth’s surface often do. Since the satellite observations are from a bulk layer of the atmosphere, they are not influenced by near‐​surface properties that confound the measurements of surface‐​based thermometers, including such issues as local landscape changes (such as urbanization and deforestation) and uneven spatial coverage.



However, there are also some problems that satellite measurements share with surface measurements, including changing instruments as the MSU sensor has a limited lifetime, so there have been many different ones taking measurements over the years.



There is also the problem changing instrument locations. The satellites orbit at an altitude in which there are still traces of the atmosphere, which drag on the satellites resulting in lower altitudes.



As with surface measurements, these issues must be carefully worked through in order to produce a climatologically useful temperature history. After all, much like the network of surface thermometers, the initial MSU instruments were developed to provide temperature measurements to improve daily weather forecasts, rather than as long‐​term climate monitors.



The painstaking work of Spencer and Christy (and other scientists subsequent to their initial publication), has made the MSU temperature record one the most important tools we have in the study of how the earth’s climate has been changing in recent decades and how the observed changes compare with climate model projections.



The images below show the character of the temporal (Figure 1) and spatial (Figure 2) temperature trends from the earth’s lower atmosphere as compiled by Spencer and Christy from December 1978 through November 2011 — a period spanning 33 years, or nearly a third of a century.







Some general observations:



• The linear trend through the 33‐​yr global record of temperatures in the earth’s lower atmosphere (Figure 1) is 0.138°C/decade.



• The warming trend increases from south to north. The trend in the Southern Hemisphere is 0.078°C/decade. The trend in the Northern Hemisphere is 0.197°C/decade. Substantial portions of the high southern latitudes show little warming or actual cooling.



• The high northern latitudes are warming the at the greatest rate.



• The global rate of warming is near the low end of the climate model projected rate of warming over the last 33 years.



• The rate of warming in the tropical latitudes has been much less than climate model projections of that warming rate.



Take some time to study and consider both Figure 1 and Figure 2 above, for they are the best records of how the earth’s temperatures have changed during the period of the most rapid increase in the anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols. Bear in mind that not all of what you see is a direct response to those emissions. For instance, volcanic eruptions and the oscillations of El Niño/​La Niña have a noticeable and marked impact. But the general picture gives you a pretty good idea of the character of the earth’s temperature change — a character that more than likely will be continued into at least the near future (the next several decades) and likely throughout much of the coming century.

"Japan is aiming to host the first Olympic Games powered solely by renewable sources. If successful, this could help the country carve a new niche in the global order as a champion of climate action and environmental protection – and set off a clean energy race in the process. As well as committing to 100% renewable power for the 2020 games, Japan’s Olympic organising committee plans to offset all unavoidable CO₂ emissions, ensure that all products are sourced according to a strict sustainability code, and use lease and rental services so that 99% of procured goods will be recycled or reused. For example, athletes’ uniforms will be made from recycled fabric, and Japanese citizens have donated used electronics from which all medals will be created. Games organisers have also committed to nearly eliminating waste in new constructions, which will be built to strict energy efficiency standards. The Olympic Village is being designed as a new model for sustainable inner-city housing, with seawater heat pumps, food waste-powered biogas, and nationally sourced timber. And with aims to integrate city and nature. Also being creating are 537 hectares of new green space, while existing spaces are being closed off as nature reserves to protect biodiversity. There are plans to filter rainwater and waste water for use at competition venues. If such a vision is achieved, Tokyo could significantly raise the bar for future games, which have typically created massive carbon footprints. That of Rio 2016 was larger than the annual emissions of 35 countries. Tokyo 2020’s sustainability focus is important not just for future Olympics, but also for Japan itself. Since the 1990s, global attention on Japan has waned. Once a formidable economic force, the country has been overshadowed by China’s remarkable economic growth. And thanks to the rise of K-Pop and TV dramas such as Master’s Sun and My Love From the Star, South Korea has now taken up Japan’s former role as the region’s cultural vanguard. Japan’s diplomatic leverage has also declined in recent years. In the early 2000s, the country was an important player in six-party talks to find a peaceful resolution to security concerns over North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme. Other parties continue to play a high-profile role, with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un recently meeting Trump, Putin, and South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Japan, in contrast, now finds itself on the sidelines. Taking a lead in clean energy and climate action – a return to the turn of the century, when Japan played a key role in forging climate consensus – could be the country’s opportunity to carve a new geopolitical path.  Of course, it’s not without competition. In the wake of the US’ withdrawal from the Paris Agreement in 2017, China is filling the climate leadership vacuum, and emerging as a dominant force in international agreements. India – set to be severely affected by climate breakdown – is attempting to do the same, with both nations investing heavily in renewable energy and green technology. But as a technological and vibrant society, Japan is also well-placed to take the lead on climate. It is third only to China and the US in installed solar power capacity, and solar’s share of the Japanese energy mix is more than double that of its rivals. Japanese solar firms are at the forefront of solar panel innovation, having twice broken efficiency records in recent years. The country has also recently announced goals to achieve zero-carbon steel and transport sectors. Japan’s hydrogen industry is world-leading, and it intends to showcase the fuel at the Olympics by using it to power the Olympic torches, as well as parts of athletes’ village. As it prepares to host the next G20 summit, Japan has been vocal in calling for ambitious international climate commitments. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has made no secret of his intention for Japan to be a climate leader. Countries have traditionally struggled to decouple economic and emissions growth, but at the World Economic Forum in early 2019, Abe proclaimed that “spending money on a green Earth and a blue ocean – once deemed costly – is now a growth generator”. If the country can successfully use the Olympics to show this, it could lead to a global technological race for ever-more profitable clean energy. Use of the Olympics as a platform for political and social purposes is, of course, not without history. Now, with the climate crisis becoming ever more urgent and heavily-reported, the 2020 summer Olympics may well provide the footing for a shift in the climate order. The Olympic movement’s goal is to build a peaceful and better world – what better way than by setting off a clean energy race? Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter.

"**The number of Covid-19 related deaths registered in Northern Ireland has risen for the seventh week in a row.**
According to government statistics agency Nisra, 100 deaths were registered in the week to Friday 20 November.
That is four more than the previous week, and takes Nisra's overall total to 1,301.
It includes the deaths of 69 people in hospital - the largest weekly hospital death toll recorded since March.
On Friday 12 further deaths linked to Covid-19 in Northern Ireland were reported by the Department of Health, bringing its total to 974.
The department also recorded 391 new cases of coronavirus.
The Department of Health record separate figures based on the number of daily positive test results recorded.
Nisra's figures are based on mentions of the virus on death certificates.
On that measure, NISRA has recorded 789 (59.2%) deaths in hospital, including the deaths of 113 people normally resident in care homes.
Taking that and 447 who died in care homes, care home residents account for just over two-fifths of all Covid-19 related deaths in Northern Ireland (42.0%).
Other deaths were recorded in hospices (0.7%) and residential addresses (6.6%). Deaths in care homes and hospices involved 106 separate establishments.
People aged 75 and over account for around two-thirds of all Covid-19 related deaths (65.1%).
The provisional number of all deaths for the week ending 20th November was 396.
That is 10 fewer than the previous week and 77 more than the five-year average of 319.
Excess deaths are those above what would normally be expected at the time of year, averaged over five years.
Nisra found 1,753 excess deaths have been registered in the past 34 weeks.
On Thursday Health Minister Robin Swann said plans are under way to allow Northern Ireland's vaccination programme to begin in December should any of the potential vaccines gain safety approval.
Mr Swann said its roll out - to be overseen by the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation (JCVI) - will be ""a major logistical exercise lasting many months"".
John Compton, a former chief executive of NI's Health and Social Care Board, agrees.
The vaccination programme may take longer than the public anticipates, he said.
""It is a colossal exercise - there will be many operational problems people will run into,"" he told BBC News NI.
Mr Compton said that the scale of the roll out will have many practical challenges.
""Where is the vaccination going to be given? Will it be given in GP surgeries? You will have to get venues sorted out for it. Then you have to store vaccines, particularly if it has to be stored at -60 or -70 degrees, that is not something that is straightforward,"" he said.
Staffing is likely to be an issue too, he added.
Unlike a testing programme which can be undertaken by untrained staff, Mr Compton said that a vaccination programme ""needs to be clinically led""."

The discussion of the 1998 Mann “Hockeystick” seems like it will never die. (The “Hockeystick” was Dr. Michael Mann’s famous graph showing flatline historical temperatures followed by a huge modern rise.) Claims of the Hockeystick’s veracity continue apace, with people doggedly wanting to believe that the results are “robust”. I thought I’d revisit something I first posted and then expanded on at ClimateAudit a few years ago, which are the proxies in Michael Mann et al.’s 2008 paper, “Proxy-based reconstructions of hemispheric and global surface temperature variations over the past two millennia” (M2008). This was another salvo in Mann’s unending attempt to revive his fatally flawed 1998 “Hockeystick” paper. I used what is called “Cluster Analysis” to look at the proxies. Cluster analysis creates a tree-shaped structure called a “dendrogram” that shows the similarity between the individual datasets involved. Figure 1 shows the dendrogram of the 95 full-length proxies used in the M2008 study:
Figure 1. Cluster Dendrogram of the 95 proxies in the Mann 2008 dataset which extend from the year 1001 to 1980. The closer together two proxies are in the dendrogram, the more similar they are. Absolute similarity is indicated by the left-right position of the fork connecting two datasets. The names give the dataset abbreviation as used by Mann2008, the type (e.g. tree ring, ice core) the location as lat/long, the name of the princiipal investigator, and if tree rings the species abbreviation (e.g. PIBA, PILO).
What can we learn from this dendrogram showing the results of the cluster analysis of the Mann 2008 proxies?

First let me start by describing how the dendrogram is made. The program compares all possible pairs of proxies, and measures their similarity. It selects the most similar pair, and draws a “fork” that connects the two.
Take a look at the “forks” in the dendrogram. The further to the left the fork occurs, the more similar are the pairs. The two most similar proxy datasets in the whole bunch are ones that are furthest to the left. They turn out to be the Tiljander “lightsum” and “thicknessmm” datasets.
Once these two are identified, they are then averaged. The individual proxy datasets are replaced by the average of the two. Then the procedure is repeated. This time it compares all possible remaining pairs, including the average of the first two as a single dataset. Again the most similar pair is selected, marked with a “fork” (slightly to the right of the first fork), and averaged. In the dataset above, the most similar pair is again among the Tiljander proxies. In this case, the pair consists of the “darksum” proxy on the one hand, and the average of the two Tiljander proxies from the first step on the other hand. These two are then removed and replaced with their average.
This procedure is repeated over and over again, until all of the available proxies have been averaged together and added to the dendrogram and it is complete.
In this case, the clustering is clearly not random. In general a cluster is composed of measurements of similar things in a single geographical area (e.g. Argentinian Cypress tree rings). In addition, the proxies tend to cluster by proxy type (e.g. speleothems and sediments vs. tree rings).
Next, the dendrogram can be read from the bottom up to show which groups of proxies are most dissimilar to the others. The more outlying and more unusual group a group is, the nearer it is to the top of the dendrogram.
Next, note that many of the groups of proxies are much more similar to each other than they are to any of the other proxies. In particular the bristlecone “stripbark pines” end up right at the top of the dendrogram, because they are the most atypical group of the lot. Only when there is absolutely no other choice are the bristlecones at the top of the dendrogram added to the dendrogram.
So how does this type of analysis clarify whether the “Hockeystick” is real? The question at issue all along has been, is the “hockeystick” shape something that can be seen in a majority of the proxies, or is it limited to a few proxies? This is usually phrased as whether the results are “robust” to the removal of subsets of the proxies. And as usual in climate science, there are several backstories to this question of “robustness”.
The first backstory on this question is that well prior to this study, the National Research Council (2006) “Surface Temperature Reconstructions for the Last 2,000 Years” recommended that the bristlecone and related “stripbark” pines not be used in paleotemperature reconstructions. This recommendation had also been made previously by other experts in the field. The problem for Mann, of course, is that the hockeystick signal doesn’t show up much when one leaves out the bristlecones. So like a junkie unable to resist going back for one last fix, Dr. Mann and his adherents have found it almost impossible to give up the bristlecones.
The next backstory is that a number of the bristlecone proxy records collected by Graybill have failed replication, as shown by the Ababneh Thesis. Not only that, but one of the authors of M2008 (Malcolm Hughes) had to have known that, because he was on her PhD committee … so the M2008 study used proxies that were not only not recommended for use, but  proxies not recommended for use that they knew had failed replication. Bad scientists, no cookies.
The final backstory is that the Tiljander proxies a) were said by the original authors to be hopelessly compromised in recent times and who advised against their use as temperature proxies, and b) were used upside-down by Mann (what he called warming the proxies actually showed as cooling).
With all of that as prologue, Figure 2 shows the average signals of the clusters of normalized proxies (averaged after each proxy is normalized to an average of zero and a standard deviation of one). See if you can tell where the Hockeystick shaped signal is located …
Figure 2. Left column shows average signals of the clusters of proxies shown in Figure 1, from the year 1001 to 1980. Averages are of the cluster to which each is connected by a short black line.
You can see the problems with the various Tiljander series, which are obviously contaminated … they go off the charts in the latter part of the record. In addition, if the Tiljander data were real it would be saying record cold, not record hot, but the computational method of Mann et al. flipped it over.
The reason for the unending addiction of Mann and his adherents to certain groups of proxies becomes obvious in this analysis. The hockeystick shape is entirely contained in a few clusters—the Greybill bristlecones and related stripbark species, the upside-down Tiljander proxies, and a few Asian tree ring records. The speleothems and lake sediments tell a very different story, one of falling temperatures … and in most of the clusters, there’s not much of a common signal at all. Which is why the attempts to rescue the original 1998 “hockeystick” have re-used and refuse to stop re-using those few proxies, proxies which are known to be unsuitable for use in paleotemperature reconstructions. They refuse to stop recycling them for a simple reason … you can’t make hockeysticks without those few proxies.
To sum up. Is the mining of “hockeystick” shaped climate reconstructions from this dataset a “robust” finding?
Not for me, not one bit. While you can get a hockeystick if you waterboard this data long enough, the result is a chimera, a false result of improper analysis. The hockeystick shaped signal is far too localized, and occurs in far too few of the clusters, to call it “robust” in any sense of the word.

PS – The entire saga of the Ababneh Thesis, along with lots and lots of other interesting information, is available over at ClimateAudit. People who want to improve their knowledge about things like the proxy records and the Climategate FOI requests and the whole climate saga should certainly do their homework at ClimateAudit first … because in the marvelous world of Climate Science, things are rarely what they seem.
[UPDATE] Some commenters asked for the data, my apologies for not providing it. It is located at the NOAA Paleoclimate repository here.

Sometimes you just have to wonder! Let’s freeze the Arctic to make up for all the ice those nasty farmers in New Zealand have melted with their farting cows.



A team of designers led by Faris Rajak Kotahatuhaha proposes re-freezing sea water in the Arctic to create miniature modular icebergs using a submarine-like vessel, in a bid to combat climate change.  
The Indonesian designer worked on the prototype with collaborators Denny Lesmana Budi and Fiera Alifa for an international competition organised by the Association of Siamese **Architects**. […]



“The main goal of this idea is to restore the polar ecosystem, which has a direct effect on the balance of the global climate,” said the designer, adding that in this scenario “it is better to prevent than cure“. […]



The submarine-like vessel would submerge to collect sea water in a central hexagonal tank. **Turbines** would then be used to blast the tank with cold air and accelerate the freezing process.



During this process, the vessel would return to the surface of the sea and the tank would be covered to protect it from sunlight. A system of reverse osmosis would be used to filter some of the salt from the water in order to speed up the process.



Once the water is frozen, the vessel would submerge again, leaving behind an “ice baby” with a volume of 2,027 cubic-metres. These miniature icebergs would then cluster together in a honeycomb pattern to form a larger ice floe.



Ever felt the heat rising from the rear of your refrigerator? To freeze something, even cold arctic water, takes energy. The word “turbines” is used. These will run on “fossil” fuels no doubt. They will generate heat as well. 



Everything in this stupid idea, refrigeration, reverse osmosis, pumping heat, takes a lot of work. The latent heat of fusion extracted from the water to turn it into ice and the waste heat from all the processes above will have to go somewhere. If they release the waste heat into the Arctic ocean, or the air, it will most likely melt the ice their submarine just finished freezing.



Muppets!



Watch it all and be amazed.

If I was throwing a dinner party and had to choose between inviting a hardcore Amway enthusiast and a vegan, well, just sign me up for a fun evening learning how to earn extra income.



Amway are notorious for the cult-like evangelism of their members, whose persistence would shame a toddler dragging on your arm in the supermarket aisle and screaming for a Bertie Beetle. **Vegans are even worse.** Vegans seem to see everything as an opening to hold forth on the moral superiority of their cult. Their latest fixation is climate change, and the wholly fictitious notion that veganism is an absolute necessity if we are to avoid barbecuing the entire planet.



After years of failed global attempts to cut carbon emissions meaningfully, some activists are propagating the idea that everyone on the planet should go vegetarian or even vegan.



But when an idea is too ridiculous for even the Greens, then you just know it’s all a load of pure-meat baloney.



It’s interesting to note that even environmentalists themselves are loathe to make the major lifestyle changes that would be required to avoid all meat products. A recent survey found that most of the UK Green Party’s elected representatives are in fact meat-eaters…who see veganism is a fad.



Still, this nonsense gets a lot of uncritical airtime, mainly, it seems, because it panders to the never-ending thirst for climate change extremism among the media-elite.



The truth is we can’t stop temperature rises with our diets…First, that cut isn’t to our entire emissions — just those from food. That means Four-fifths of emissions are ignored, according to an analysis of emission from the European Union, which means the impact is actually five-times lower.



Second, the more optimistic figures about how much of your emissions you can cut are based not just on a vegetarian diet, but on an entirely vegan one where we avoid every single animal product altogether.



But, the luvvies know that veganism is **way** harder to sell to the masses than vegetarianism. Especially to the masses in developing countries who are itching to get **off** a vegetarian diet imposed by poverty, and chow down on some of that luxurious, tasty meat.



A systematic peer-review of studies of going vegetarian shows that a non-meat diet will likely reduce an individual’s emissions by…just 4.3%.



This still overstates the effect, because it ignores the well-established “rebound effect.” Vegetarian diets are slightly cheaper, and saved money will likely be spent on other goods and services that cause extra greenhouse gas emissions. In the U.S., vegetarians save at least $750 on their food budgets every year. That extra spending will cause more carbon dioxide emissions, cancelling about half the saved carbon emissions from going vegetarian.



So much for the much-vaunted savings from going vegetarian. $750 a year is a price I’ll gladly pay to keep my steak, instead of some tasteless, vat-grown conglomeration of industrial chemistry.



In a first world setting, the reality is that going entirely vegetarian for the rest of your life means you reduce your emissions by about 2%, according to a study of the environmental impact of Swedish vegetarians.



  
So you decide, dear readers: reduce emissions by a whole two percent, or, for just $14 a week, continue to enjoy tasty, nutritious meat? In fact, **why not show your utter contempt for environmental hysteria by ordering a[delicious Whale Meat Company package](https://whalemeat.co.nz/) today?**

"**Officials have arrested 21 people accused of attempting to use fake ""Covid-free certificates"" to travel from Kenya to the United Arab Emirates.**
It came after the UAE issued a visa ban on Kenyans, allegedly after visitors were found using forged certificates.
The suspects are due to appear in court later on Friday, according to local media.
Coronavirus cases are rising in Kenya and on Thursday it tightened restrictions on public gatherings.
Earlier this week, the UAE decided to stop giving visas to citizens of 13 countries, including Kenya, Somalia, Libya, Tunisia and Algeria.
The 21 travellers were attempting to fly to Dubai when they were apprehended at the main airport in Kenyan capital Nairobi on Thursday.
They are accused of using forged medical documents that certified they tested negative for coronavirus in advance of travel.
On another recent flight, from Nairobi to Dubai, about 100 Kenyans were reportedly found with similar falsified documents and half later tested positive at the airport, according to Kenyan website Nairobi news.
Kenya has recorded 80,102 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 1,427 deaths since the pandemic began. On Thursday a further 780 infections were reported, according to the Kenyan health ministry.
New restrictions on public gatherings were introduced on Thursday. The number of guests allowed to attend weddings has been reduced to 50 and no more than 100 mourners may attend a funeral.
Meanwhile church services are now limited to a maximum of 90 minutes."

University of Graz Professor Richard Parncutt. Photo source: Uni-Graz./
There’s been much buzz in the blogs recently about the seemingly psychotic music professor calling for the death penalty for skeptics of IPCC science. He claims that by being skeptical of climate science, we are hindering necessary policy measures that will supposedly prevent the deaths of hundreds of millions of future people. A figure the loony prof calls “conservative”.
Parncutt also wants to have the Pope executed

Reader Quinn over at WUWT now brings our attention to a report on how Prof Richard Parncutt has also called for the execution of the head of the Catholic Church, Pope Benedict. WND Faith website here writes:
‘The pope and perhaps some of his closest advisers should be sentenced to  death,’ wrote Richard Parncutt, a music teacher at the University of Graz,  Austria.
Parncutt must have an affinity for recommending the death penalty, as WND reported only a day earlier that  Parncutt was labeled the ‘Green Weenie of the Year’ for also recommending in a blog post that those who don’t believe in global warming should be executed.
Now, according to a report from CampusReform.org,  Parncutt also has put the pope down on his list of those to be eliminated.
The report said Parncutt wrote, ‘I am talking about the current pope, because his continuing refusal to make a significant change to the church’s position on  contraception will certainly result in millions of further unnecessary deaths  from AIDS in the future.'”

The recent heat wave in the Midwest and the eastern United States has been characterized by all sorts of exaggerated claims. One even made it into Wikipedia as an “official” all time high record. From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state_temperature_extremes

Dr. Roy Spencer alerted me to a problem on Monday, and I did some preliminary investigation, confirming that yes indeed, not only was that 113°F value not an official new high temperature record, it doesn’t even appear to be air temperature, but so far out of line could it be the heat index value for July 22nd? Either that, or a careless typo by the volunteer Wikipedian conflating 103F to 113F.
I wanted to wait a few days to see if Wikipedia’s claim that it is “self-correcting” would actually work as advertised, and I’m happy to report that the table has in fact been corrected.

It is back to the previous value of 106°F / 41°C July 15, 1995 in Danbury, CT, which is well documented. But doing further research on the high for July 22nd that was erroneously cited, even that value seems to be inconsistent with published records.
So what was the actual record and the previous one for Hartford? Well, that’s the thing, depending on where you look, you get different answers. Curious, I found myself getting sucked down another climate science rabbit hole, which took my entire Saturday morning and part of Saturday afternoon to compile for you below. 
First, I checked the record event report (RER) for Windsor locks (Now an ASOS station at Hartford’s Bradley International Airport) from the NWS WSFO in Boston:
000

SXUS71 KBOX 222019

RERBDL

RECORD EVENT REPORT

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE TAUNTON MA

419 PM EDT FRI JUL 22 2011

...RECORD DAILY MAXIMUM TEMPERATURE AND AN ALL TIME RECORD

TEMPERATURE SET AT HARTFORD CT...

AT 406 PM THE TEMPERATURE REACHED

103 DEGREES AT BRADLEY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT.

THIS SETS A NEW RECORD HIGH TEMPERATURE FOR TODAYS DATE FOR

HARTFORD CT. THE PREVIOUS RECORD WAS 101 DEGREES IN

1926.THE TEMPERATURE OF 103 DEGREES ALSO SETS AN ALL TIME

RECORD HIGH TEMPERATURE FOR HARTFORD.

THE PREVIOUS RECORD OF 102 DEGREES WAS SET ON MULTIPLE DATES OF

JULY 6 2010...AUGUST 9 OF 2001 AND JULY 3 OF 1996.
And that was dutifully reported in the Norwich Bulletin, which erroneously conflated in the title the new Windsor Locks (Bradley Airport) record for the date, and all time high for that station, with the all time high state record of 106°F on July 15th, 1995 in Danbury, CT:

Clearly, it wasn’t the hottest day in the state history. The headline is wrong.
But here’s the thing,  when you go check the official records at the National Climatic Data Center’s interactive records plotting tool, you don’t get the same as what was reported in the RER:

That’s odd.
The RER from WSFO Boston says for the date of July 22nd:
THE PREVIOUS RECORD WAS 101 DEGREES IN 1926.
The NCDC Records lookup says:
Previous 97.0°F on 1955-07-22
Let’s check some other sources, the HamWeather interactive records generator says:

They report yet a third previous record value:
Old record 97° in 1926
Bizarre. Three different sources say the previous record was three different values and dates in the past.
So what was the previous high temperature record for Hartford Bradley Airport/Windsor Locks? I have no idea, and apparently nobody is sure either, including NWS/NOAA/NCDC.
But I started to wonder about the station itself. This was an ASOS station, and as we know, they tend to have technical problems associated with reporting false high temperatures due to a design flaw, and sometimes due to placement. So I decided to have a look at the station itself. First stop, NCDC MMS station meta-database to get the exact lat/lon for the ASOS station with the COOP ID NUMBER of 063456 as reported by NCDC.
Oddly though, when I went to look up the lat/lon, I found this station had two COOP NUMBERs assigned to it, 063456 and 069704:

Looking at the history, that appears related to a station move in 1954:

By NOAA COOP station rules (as I understand them), new COOP numbers are assigned when the new environment is appreciably different, such as by distance, elevation, and/or environment. This may explain why we have different references to past record high temperature. The databases presenting the record comparisons may be using different COOP ID numbers.
But what about the temperature record of 103°F itself? I wanted to see how it compared to nearby stations, because as I’ve demonstrated in the past, ASOS stations can produce false high temperature records where a nearby station might be degrees cooler. For example the ASOS station in Honolulu that created a whole string of false temperature records that the NWS admits to, but leaves the records intact anyway. In that episode I demonstrated that two NOAA stations, only 3.9 miles apart had vastly different high temperatures. One station (ASOS at the airport) set records, the other, at the NOAA Pacific Tsunami Warning Center did not.
So how would this one in Hartford hold up? Well at first glance, we see the Google Earth image for the Hartford Bradley ASOS station at 41.9381 -72.6825 shows a significantly different environment than the surrounding countryside:

The “A” marks the location of the ASOS weather station. Note how the airport is a patch of brown in a sea of green, likely due to the change in vegetation. That’s quite a stark contrast and certainly does not seem representative of the area.
In the National Weather Service Observing Handbook No. 2 (NWS, 1989), it talks about “representivity” stating:
“The equipment site should be fairly level, sodded, and free from obstructions (exhibit 5.1). It should be typical of the principal natural agricultural soils and conditions of the area…Neither the pan nor instrument shelter should be placed over heat-absorbing surfaces such as asphalt, crushed rock, concrete slabs or pedestals. The equipment should be in full sunlight during as much of the daylight hours as possible, and be generally free of obstructions to wind flow.”
Here’s the closeup view of the ASOS station at Bradley AP:

While certainly fine placement for monitoring the runways, it is not the best for climate monitoring. Note the mower lines. The character of the grass changes with the season no doubt.
So I decided to have a look at the data that day, Weather Underground helpfully archives the data, and they report the record high:

I found the temperature graph WU plotted very interesting:

It appears that from 1:30PM to 5PM, the temperature plateaued and did not change. To me, that suggests some sort of saturation related equipment failure. But, since I don’t have maintenance records for that station, I can only speculate.
But, there are other sources of data. Weather Underground also helpfully logs private weather stations in the area. Here’s one located on Poquonock / Hawthorne Ln, Windsor, CT at lat/lon 41.885 -72.692, just 3.6 miles to the SSW:

And the high temperature WU reported by that station KCTWINDS6, is 99.9°F, which is 3 degrees cooler than the nearby airport record high of 103°F:

Here’s the temperature graph:

Note the duration of the plateau is shorter, from about 2:15PM to 4:30PM. Note also the time at which the 99.9 F high occurred:
15:53   99.9 °F
3:53PM was Tmax for this private weather station.
Remember the RER from WSFO Boston said:
AT 406 PM THE TEMPERATURE REACHED 103 DEGREES AT BRADLEY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT.
So why the 3 degree difference in Tmax at about the same time? One possibility is that the airport environment is more efficient at converting solar radiation to heat, and kept accumulating heat faster than the environment of the KCTWINDS6, or as I posited earlier, it may have something to do with the ASOS equipment itself.
OK, well maybe that’s a fluke, let’s look at another station. I found another one logged by WU about 12 miles SE, called KCTMANCH2.

The high at KCTMANCH2 is also 99.9°F, which is 3 degrees cooler than the nearby airport record high of 103°F:

The graph is consistent with the other private weather station:

As is the time of the high temperature:
15:45  99.9 °F
While the other private station  KCTWINDS6 had no metadata on the station type, I tend to trust the data from this particular station, because it is a quality weather station , one of the best available, The Davis Vantage Pro2 with fan aspiration:

So we have two stations at 6 and 12 miles from the airport that show identical highs (99.9°F) in a similar time frame. But, lest I be accused of cherry picking, lets look at another nearby station, one that does not agree with my premise, one even closer, just under 3 miles away at 41.920 -72.735:

This station, KCTEASTG2 had a high temperature that hit 103.6°F, and in fact it would be rounded up to 104°F by NWS rules if it were an official station. At first glance it would tend to confirm the airport record high temperature as being valid.

But when you look at the data log, you discover an odd discontinuity, the high temperature was set around 11AM:

From the KCTEASTG2 data arhcive, that high was:
11:13   103.6 °F
That Tmax doesn’t make any sense meteorologically. It is before peak insolation, and very short lived. According to this solar calculator provide by NASA, solar noon for that location is at 13:57 (GMT-6, DST enabled).
A check of other days of data, such as on July 20th, July 19th, show a similar odd peak in late morning, well before solar noon.

I’d tend to discount this station data as it looks to me as some sort of local exposure effect, like the station being influenced by direct sun or reflection of sun off a window or some other similar bias which can happen in backyard. Note the data settles down afterwards. This could simply be a case of direct or reflected sun hitting the sensor.
The metadata published by WU on KCTEASTG2  also doesn’t support a good case for this station’s measurement quality:

The WS-2308CH is a cheap weather station made in China, sold by LaCrosse. One of the big design flaws is the thermometer shelter, seen below, which bizarrely has no slots or louvers for air flow in the plastic cover, which would tend to create a trapped air hotspot when exposed to direct sunlight. That makes this station temperature exposure suspect if it gets the direct sun.

Back to the data. After that first peak at around 11AM, it cools rapidly, then starts a slow plateau upwards, peaking again over 90 minutes earlier than the time of the record high set at the airport
14:25  100.9 °F
That’s still two degrees cooler than the airport, and around the time of all the other measurements, a window of 15:45-16:15, we find:

So given the later afternoon temperatures are in the settled period after the first 11AM peak, they might be valid. The temperature data for that period are in agreement with the other two private weather stations I cite above.
Finally one more station, this one 7.4 miles to the NNE at 42.009 -72.576 in a residential area:

The temperature peaked at 102.0F

The timing of Tmax was also a bit earlier than the other stations, but has that similar ramp up right about 11AM:

According the KCTENFIE5 data archive, the Tmax was just before 1 PM:
12:55   102.0 °F
That peak temperature is an hour before solar noon in the area at 13:57, and very brief, 20 minutes later it is down a whole degree again:
13:15   101.0 °F
It never comes close to that peak again at solar noon or thereafter, so again there may be some sort of local exposure effect going on. This station while a good one, is not fan aspirated:

Without looking at the site and equipment placement, I can’t tell if that early Tmax is related to some sort of exposure issue (like a sunlight reflection) or not. But it is suspect giving the time prior to solar noon and briefness of it. Even so it didn’t reach the 103°F recorded at the airport.
At the time of the new record high at the airport, 4:06 PM, 7.3 miles to the SW, the temperature at  is once again in agreement KCTENFIE5 with all the other private weather stations nearby:
16:05    99.0 °F
Summary

The Norwich Bulletin reporter didn’t check the data, and erroneously conflated all time station record with an all time state record.
The previous record dates/values for Windsor locks cited by three different sources doesn’t match the Record Event Report issued by WSFO Boston, possibly due to the station move not being recorded in the databases properly or old databases being used.
There was no new all time state record for Connecticut set. The old one of 106°F on July 15th, 1995 in Danbury, CT stands.
The land use/albedo of the Windsor Locks/Bradley AP ASOS is significantly different than the surrounding area, and by NOAA’s own COOP handbook, would not likely be representative.
Other weather stations around the airport within a radius of 3-12 miles don’t show a Tmax equal to the new record high of 103°F for Windsor Locks/Bradley AP ASOS. The one that does is highly suspect due to timing and equipment. A second station that comes close has a Tmax before solar noon.
All four stations around the airport are within a degree of each other, between 99.0 and 99.9F  around 4PM, when the new record high was recorded.
As demonstrated previously in Honolulu, ASOS airport stations are known to create new record highs erroneously. This was also demonstrated by an episode of record high temperatures in Tuczon related to ASOS equipment documented by professor Ben Herman.
Now, as documented on WUWT a few days ago, even internal NOAA staff are beginning to doubt the accuracy of these ASOS stations.

So what is my point of all this and why did I spend so much time on it?
It is easy to claim new records, and to report them. Just look at how easy it was for some dimwit to turn 103°F  into 113°F on Wikipedia and how easy it was for the reporter to make a false claim of confusion about the all time Connecticut state record. It took just a few minutes for the reporter to write the story and headline claiming “hottest day in state history”, but it took half a day of solid work to debunk it and present it here.
When one goes looking at the data in context, a different story emerges. That story shows that there’s far more to the temperature data than the peaks and valleys. Often, they don’t make sense in the context of the measurement environment, yet they are widely used, often without question as demonstrated in this episode. Worse, sloppy or confused old records don’t seem to be adequate for determining what the previous record high for the date actually is, as demonstrated by the wide disagreement in reporting it.
To fully understand what we are measuring in surface temperature, taking the single peak high temperature without understanding the context of it can be a risky business. As I’ve said many times before, the dynamically changing land use environment at airports is inconsistent with the need for stability in long term climate measurement. Even if the station never moved, comparing highs of the past (when the airport was smaller) can lead to inflated highs today.
I would hope that NOAA takes a hard look at the new record high at Windsor Locks/Bradley AP, to see if it is valid, and that the Norwich Bulletin corrects their erroneous story about the state all-time high.

"It is amazing for me to see the very aggressive building boom underway in south Florida; on the beaches and barrier islands, throughout downtown and in the low western areas bordering the Everglades. They are building like there is no tomorrow. Unfortunately, they are right. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) published its assessment of sea level rise in 2012 as part of the National Climate Assessment. Including estimates based on limited and maximum melt of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, it anticipated a raise of 4.1 to 6.6ft (1.25 to 2m) by 2100, reaching 2ft (0.6m) by around 2050 and 3ft (0.9m) by around 2075. This degree of sea level rise would make nearly all the barrier islands of the world uninhabitable, inundate a major portion of the world’s deltas, upon which hundreds of millions of people live, and leave low-lying coastal zones like southeast Florida increasingly difficult to maintain infrastructure services for and increasingly vulnerable to hurricanes and storms.  Most models of projected sea level rise assume a gradual acceleration of sea level in line with gradually accelerating ice melt. But our knowledge of how sea level rose in the past paints a very different picture of response to climate change.  At the peak of the last ice age 18,000 years ago sea level was some 420ft (128m) lower due to the vast quantities of water locked away in continental ice sheets. Subsequent ice melt was not a gradual process, but rather a series of very rapid pulses of sea level rise interspersed with pauses in which coastal environments formed. During pulses the seas rose between 3-30ft (0.9-9m) fast enough to drown not just reefs, sandy barrier islands, tidal inlets and other coastal features, stranding their remnants across the continental shelf, now disappeared beneath the ocean.  That is what happens when climate change warms enough to destabilise some ice sheet sector.  It rapidly disintegrates, resulting in a rapid rise. This is what is beginning to happen to the Greenland ice sheet, where surface melting has concentrated dust and black carbon in the ice on the melting surface darkening and further accelerating the surface melt. More importantly, warmed ocean water has accelerated the ice melt at both poles, working its way into the glacial fjords under the ice sheet in Greenland and under the outlet glaciers around the Antarctic ice sheets. While this “warm” water is only 2-4°C, even this moderate heat is capable of vast amounts of ice melt, and once started, the melt creates positive reinforcing feedbacks that speed the acceleration far beyond anything originally anticipated.  Water on the melting ice surface adsorbs more heat which accelerates the surface melt. Meltwater percolating down through the ice lubricates the base permitting faster motion, which results in more extensive fracturing, in turn allowing more, warmer water through the fractures and into the interior of the ice sheet, and so on. We are most certainly witnessing the onset of a rapid pulse of sea level rise. Flying 50 miles over Greenland’s interior last summer, the Jacobshaven (or Ilulissat) Icefjord looked like the bed of a giant meandering stream carved on the surface of the ice. The bottom of the channel, some 500ft (152m) below the level of the ice sheet above was moving faster than than the ice above, having been penetrated by the warmed ocean water. As a result the ice has dramatically fractured and has accelerated, from moving a couple of miles in a year to over 20. A spectacular but most disturbing experience. Even if we stopped burning fossil fuels tomorrow, the greenhouse gasses already in the atmosphere will continue to warm the atmosphere for at least another 30 years. And as most of this heat has already been absorbed by the oceans, which have the capacity to store heat for centuries, the overall effect on ice sheet melt will continue for centuries, accelerating all the way. If we are at just 5ft (1.5m) rise at the end of the century, sea level will be rising at a foot per decade – think about trying to maintain a port facility anywhere with that. To consider the risk in present investments is beyond sobering. By the middle of this century most of the barrier islands of south Florida and the world will be abandoned and the people relocated, while low areas such as Sweetwater and Hialeah bordering the Everglades will be frequently flooded and increasingly difficult places to live. Florida will start to lose its freshwater resources, its infrastructure will begin to fail, and the risk of catastrophic storm surges and hurricane flooding will increase.  Florida counties should be planning for their future to determine at what point the costs of maintaining functional infrastructure, insurance, and human health and safety becomes economically impossible. Already, there are areas and properties that will become unlivable within a 30-year mortgage cycle. The Four-county Compact on climate change in southeast Florida has some 1,200 action items to help ensure some stability for the communities there.  For south Florida, forget the levees and dikes. That may be fine for New Orleans and the Netherlands, but not here where the limestone and sand under our homes is much too porous and permeable. For each day action is put off, it becomes harder and more expensive to make the inevitable changes required. Without planning, there will come a point where society will collapse into chaos. "

Bad news for Greenware cups like the one below.

Study: Biodegradable Products May Be Bad For The Environment
Research from North Carolina State University shows that so-called biodegradable products are likely doing more harm than good in landfills, because they are releasing a powerful greenhouse gas as they break down.
“Biodegradable materials, such as disposable cups and utensils, are broken down in landfills by microorganisms that then produce methane,” says Dr. Morton Barlaz, co-author of a paper describing the research and professor and head of NC State’s Department of Civil, Construction, and Environmental Engineering. “Methane can be a valuable energy source when captured, but is a potent greenhouse gas when released into the atmosphere.”

And the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that only about 35 percent of municipal solid waste goes to landfills that capture methane for energy use. EPA estimates that another 34 percent of landfills capture methane and burn it off on-site, while 31 percent allow the methane to escape.
“In other words,” Barlaz says, “biodegradable products are not necessarily more environmentally friendly when disposed in landfills.”
This problem may be exacerbated by the rate at which these man-made biodegradable materials break down. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) guidelines call for products marked as “biodegradable” to decompose within “a reasonably short period of time” after disposal. But such rapid degradation may actually be environmentally harmful, because federal regulations do not require landfills that collect methane to install gas collection systems for at least two years after the waste is buried. If materials break down and release methane quickly, much of that methane will likely be emitted before the collection technology is installed. This means less potential fuel for energy use, and more greenhouse gas emissions.
As a result, the researchers find that a slower rate of biodegradation is actually more environmentally friendly, because the bulk of the methane production will occur after the methane collection system is in place. Some specific biodegradable products such as bags that hold yard waste and are always sent to composting or anaerobic digestion facilities were not included in the study.
“If we want to maximize the environmental benefit of biodegradable products in landfills,” Barlaz says, “we need to both expand methane collection at landfills and design these products to degrade more slowly – in contrast to FTC guidance.”
The paper, “Is Biodegradability a Desirable Attribute for Discarded Solid Waste? Perspectives from a National Landfill Greenhouse Gas Inventory Model,” was co-authored by Barlaz and NC State Ph.D. student James Levis, and was published online May 27 by the journal Environmental Science & Technology. The research was supported by Procter & Gamble and the Environmental Research and Education Foundation.

“Is Biodegradability a Desirable Attribute for Discarded Solid Waste? Perspectives from a National Landfill Greenhouse Gas Inventory Model”
Authors: James W. Levis, Morton A. Barlaz, North Carolina State University
Published: Online May 27, Environmental Science & Technology
Abstract: There is increasing interest in the use of biodegradable materials because they are believed to be “greener”. In a landfill, these materials degrade anaerobically to form methane and carbon dioxide. The fraction of the methane that is collected can be utilized as an energy source and the fraction of the biogenic carbon that does not decompose is stored in the landfill. A landfill life-cycle model was developed to represent the behavior of MSW components and new materials disposed in a landfill representative of the U.S. average with respect to gas collection and utilization over a range of environmental conditions (i.e., arid, moderate wet, and bioreactor). The behavior of materials that biodegrade at relatively fast (food waste), medium (biodegradable polymer) and slow (newsprint and office paper) rates was studied. Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyoctanoate) (PHBO) was selected as illustrative for an emerging biodegradable polymer. Global warming potentials (GWP) of 26, 720, -1000, 990, and 1300 kg CO2e wet Mg1_ were estimated for MSW, food waste, newsprint, office paper, and PHBO, respectively in a national average landfill. In a state-of-the-art landfill with gas collection and electricity generation, GWP’s of -250, 330, -1400, -96, and -420 kg CO2e wet Mg1 _ were estimated for MSW, food waste, newsprint, office paper and PHBO, respectively. Additional simulations showed that for a hypothetical material, a slower biodegradation rate and a lower extent of biodegradation improve the environmental performance of a material in a landfill representative of national average conditions.

For more than 30 years, free and open markets have propelled China’s labor‐​driven growth and lifted more than 200 million of its citizens out of rural poverty. But America’s recent economic downturn has hit China hard. Exports from its booming trade sector dropped 17.5 percent in January from a year ago. In the past several months, an estimated 20 million rural Chinese migrant workers have lost their jobs.



China’s rising unemployment could lead to increased social unrest, and challenge the authority of the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Throughout 30 years of liberal reform, the CCP has justified its authoritarian grip through the promise of economic advancement.



If it can’t maintain the steady growth it’s promised, experts fear the country’s leaders might bolster their legitimacy by other means, such as exploiting Chinese nationalism and directing popular discontent toward outside targets.





To put a twist on the old saying, so long as goods cross borders, soldiers won’t. 



Given the severity of the financial crisis, China will be entering a stressful and possibly turbulent period. America must be careful not to adopt policies that risk making the history of great power conflict come to fruition.



One fear is that as China’s military strength grows, Beijing may pursue more aggressive geopolitical strategies in the South China Sea, one of the largest and most heavily trafficked shipping routes in the world.



For example, China has expressed its desire to recapture the Malampaya and Camago natural gas fields from the Philippines, among other islands that offer strategic importance and/​or natural resources to quench China’s thirst for energy.



It’s a desire that’s been acted on before.



In 1988, China’s Navy destroyed Vietnamese battleships in skirmishes over the Spratly archipelago. And in 1995, Beijing successfully took control of Mischief Reef, previously claimed by the Philippines, building structures that critics said were of a military nature. (China said they were necessary to protect its fishermen.)



It’s no wonder that East Asian capitals are uneasy about China’s growing maritime clout.



“Few in Asia doubt that having succeeded once, China will try again,” explains Arthur Waldron, a professor of international relations at the University of Pennsylvania.



China’s military modernization also has implications for US national security. Rising powers have historically brought greater instability to the international system.



In a comprehensive examination of the causes of major wars, A.F.K. Organski and Jacek Kugler suggest in “The War Ledger” that as a country’s power increases, its willingness to seek change in the international system will be heightened. “It is this shift that destabilizes the system and begins the slide toward war,” they write.



While there is some evidence to support the presumption that China will become adversarial, others see China becoming a status quo power seeking peaceful relations with the rest of the global community.



For these experts, the potential for hostile US‐​China relations is all the more reason to encourage Beijing’s integration into the global economic and trading system, which may undermine China’s propensity to base its interests simply in military terms.



To put a twist on the old saying, so long as goods cross borders, soldiers won’t. Nations that trade and cooperate are less likely to go to war, and given today’s economic climate, it’s hoped that Chinese and American strategic interests are converging because of economic interdependence.



Economic interdependence, of course, doesn’t preclude war. Strong trade ties between Britain and Germany didn’t prevent the outbreak of World War I. Nations may be willing to forgo economic gains if it conflicts with their strategic interests.



One potential flash point between the United States and China is Taiwan. Many believe that the US is committed to protect the peace and security of Taiwan from coercion by Beijing under the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979.



In recent years, China has devoted a substantial portion of its financial resources toward the transformation of its military, in order to deter, coerce, and potentially defeat outside intervention in a Taiwan Strait crisis. Taiwan’s current president, Ma Ying‐​Jeou, has placated Beijing by stating there would be no attempt to seek independence of the island during his term.



While China will not inevitably threaten the US, how America responds in the face of its rise as a great power will have profound implications on US‐​China relations. For instance, should lawmakers in Washington enact overtly hostile policies that further weaken China’s trade‐​dependent economy, the blowback could be substantial.



The current global downturn could very well be the catalyst for collective upheaval within China. But leaders in Washington must recognize that their own actions, such as pushing legislation that obliquely blames China for the loss of American jobs or chastising Chinese leaders for adapting inadequately to the global free‐​market system, harms efforts to stabilize the global economy and marginalizes Chinese citizens who want stronger ties to the West and greater liberalization at home.

"**The growth of a door-to-door Covid-19 testing scheme is Bradford is helping the city exceed nationally-set test-and-trace targets, the council said.**
The city started its own contact tracing in August, with the proportion of those reached locally growing from 73% to 86%.
But the city has the joint-worst contact tracing rate in England through the NHS Test and Trace scheme.
The government said NHS Test and Trace ""continues to evolve and improve"".
Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) data shows the city, along with Luton, only reached an overall 49% of contacts under the NHS scheme.
To be effective, government advisers say 80% of contacts of people who test positive need to self-isolate for it to be successful.
Part of the local programme involves its team of council workers and volunteers knocking on doors and offering tests.
The city, which will move into tier 3 of government restrictions when lockdown ends on 2 December, had 363 cases per 100,000 people in the latest week of 16-22 November.
The team is knocking on hundreds of doors every week to offer tests to people, with approximately one in ten people testing positive.
**By David Rhodes, BBC Yorkshire data journalist**
Put simply, it would appear local knowledge is a big factor here.
Those employed in the council-run system have a greater understanding of which neighbourhoods are at greatest risk from the virus so can decide where to spend their time.
Local contact tracers can also go out on foot - whereas those employed through the NHS system are sitting in front of laptop screens.
In multicultural cities such as Bradford local contact tracers often are able to reach people whose first language is not English.
A number of places around England have found local test-and-tracesystems are proving more effective.
Dr Mark Evans, lead for Bradford's contact-tracing programme, said: ""We have built up a team over the last few months who have been working hard to reach those that the national test-and-trace team could not contact.
""We have actually exceeded the national target set and want to continue to strengthen the team to allow more door-to-door visits.""
Sophie Mawson, a member of the door-to-door team, said: ""A lot of the time people are excited to see us, they feel relieved.
""If we turn up on the door and they don't have symptoms and they have a test, then it's good for piece of mind.""
A DHSC spokesperson said: ""Since NHS Test and Trace launched, over 2.7 million contacts have been identified, and 79.7% of all contacts where communication details were given have been reached and told to self-isolate.""

Would you spend a lot of your own money on something that would give you and your family very little, if any, benefit? Probably not. Yet this is precisely what the government leaders now meeting in Copenhagen are demanding from their taxpayers.



With the provisions of the Kyoto Protocol set to expire in 2012, proponents view the meeting in Copenhagen this month as critical to extending and expanding efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.



But even if implemented successfully, the new efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have almost no impact on global warming (cutting predicted future warming by only a fraction of a degree).



And, while it is impossible to predict the cost of any protocol to emerge from Copenhagen right now, there are estimates of costs for the Kyoto Protocol, as well as the Waxman‐​Markey bill passed in June by the U.S. House that would put in place a cap‐​and‐​trade regime aimed at cutting greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S.



The London‐​based Taxpayers Alliance estimated the cost of complying with Kyoto in Europe to be between $67.8 billion and $170.8 billion through 2008. And what did Europe get for these costs? Emissions rose in many European countries between 1997 and 2006, including some signatories of the Kyoto Protocol. The Energy Information Administration estimated that compliance costs in the U.S. would have been $400 billion a year. Ironically, emissions fell 3 percent in the U.S., which did not ratify the Kyoto Protocol, between 2000 and 2006.



The Waxman‐​Markey bill, like the companion Senate legislation and the Kyoto Protocol, aims to limit emissions from fossil fuels. The inevitable result is an increase in energy prices and all that entails for the economy.



A study by the Brookings Institution finds that meeting the Waxman‐​Markey emissions targets would result in a loss of personal consumption from $1 trillion to $2 trillion; GDP would be lower by 2.5 percent by 2050; and there would be 1.7 million fewer jobs. The Heritage Foundation estimates the largest GDP losses – up to $9.4 trillion cumulatively from 2012 to 2035 – and projects 2.5 million fewer jobs.



These independent studies project costs far larger than official estimates from the Environmental Protection Agency and the Congressional Budget Office. But even if one takes the government numbers at face value, the proposals still do not meet basic cost‐​benefit tests, in that the impact of the CO2 emissions control — even if could be achieved — would make only a tiny difference in the Earth’s temperature.



And this is to say nothing of ongoing uncertainties about what is actually going on with the Earth’s climate, which hasn’t warmed in 11 years – a pause that was not predicted by global warming scientists. As leading climatologist Kevin Trenberth wrote in one of the e‐​mails recently leaked from the Climate Research Unit in Britain, “we don’t know why it is not warming.”



So, in other words, the proposals before the U.S. Congress are almost all pain and no gain.



There’s a better way.



Throughout history, mankind has been in a constant state of rebuilding and adapting to climate changes. It’s a proven course of action, and one that doesn’t depend on predictions by climate scientists about what is going to happen in 100 years.



Whether global warming is a real problem or not, adaptation is a far less costly and far more effective way of coping then trying to re‐​engineer the Earth’s climate.

"**Contact tracing is seen as an important part of controlling the spread of Covid-19. Wales' system has consistently managed to reach the majority of cases and their close contacts, despite the pressure of rising numbers. But what's it like to work in this new role?**
Bridget Thomas' job at the North East Wales Archive has long allowed her to indulge her passion for history - but this year she's been playing a part in the historical events of 2020.
The archive is run by Flintshire and Denbighshire councils, and the 59-year-old was internally redeployed in June, splitting her time between her normal job and using her research skills as a tracer for Test, Trace, Protect (TTP).
""I wanted to do something to help. I can't work on a ward in a hospital, but I can do this,"" she said.
Her role, after a period of training, has entailed calling people who have tested positive to ask - and sometimes persuade - them to name the people they have been in contact with.
The positive cases are normally expecting the call - but tracers like Mrs Thomas know nothing about them.
""It can be quite intense. I deal with people of all ages, and people in care home settings, families, people who are very ill, or people who have been recently bereaved by Covid - it could be any scenario,"" she said.
""But people are disarmingly honest and open. Sometimes they'll say 'I know I shouldn't have done that', but I brush over that - it's done and gone.
""They generally don't seem worried for themselves. They worry about other people - infecting their children, or infecting their elderly parents if they care for them.
""We're not clinicians and there is a system in place to escalate [non-emergency medical queries].""
The names the positive cases give them are passed on to TTP ""contact advisers"", who call to tell them to self-isolate for 14 days and keep in touch daily.
Mrs Thomas said some of the people she called were concerned about their jobs and about naming close contacts ""because obviously you're implicating a work colleague for example, and making them isolate at home for 14 days"".
She said local knowledge - for example the location of workplaces, schools and colleges - helped with identifying potential clusters of cases.
When she first started, she noticed patterns of transmission in places like hospitals, care homes and work places.
But ""viruses love parties"" and over the summer more cases were linked to barbecues, birthday gatherings, pubs and tourists returning from holiday.
""As we progressed into autumn, it was then schools and colleges,"" she said. ""The one constant has been healthcare staff - and now [it's winter and] people are staying in, I'm seeing more infection spreading within families. ""
Tracers are looking for people who may be at risk of infection because they have been in contact with a positive case during the 48 hours before they developed symptoms or, if someone is asymptomatic, during the 48 hours before they took the test, up to 10 full days afterwards.
A close contact includes anyone who:
The Covid-19 contact tracing app is supposed to kick in if you've been near a positive case in a shop for example.
Flintshire council is employing all the TTP staff for the counties in the Betsi Cadwaladr health board area.
Senior HR manager Sharon Carney said: ""We need people with good listening skills, who are quite empathetic and politely persistent. We train them to listen to the pauses - is there something the person is not saying?""
They began recruiting externally in August, and new team members include hospitality workers, aircraft cabin crew and a retired police officer.
Many have said they are motivated by wanting to help.
""But we all wish it would go away,"" Mrs Thomas said.
Having dealt so closely with bereaved people this summer, Mrs Thomas reiterated that every Covid death is a tragedy, but her archive experience has also allowed her to put the current pandemic in its historical context.
""It's new to us - but it happened with Spanish flu, the plague, cholera.
""I came across a record from 1839 the other day that was a request from a parish council to the magistrates, asking for funeral wakes to be banned because they were spreading cholera,"" she said.
""We also hold education logbooks for local schools from 1862... usually written by the head teacher [providing] a social record of how prevalent childhood diseases like measles, diphtheria, influenza, and scarlet fever were before mass vaccination.
""Whole classes would regularly be required to stay at home, not only to deep-clean classrooms but also to stop transmission of disease. Unfortunately, school log books also record many deaths of children from disease.
""What our ancestors had to put up with was unbelievable. Covid-19 will be over one day. We just have to get through it.""
As case numbers rose, the overall speed of TTP in Wales slowed down relatively, although it picked up to a degree in November as the ""firebreak"" took effect.
Although the system has generally reached more than 80% of cases and close contacts, in reality the huge rise in transmission since September has meant thousands have not been contacted at all.
Overall since June, TTP in Wales has reached 47,992 positive cases, and 132,323 people ""close contacts"".
Almost 1,800 tracers and contact advisers are in place across Wales and the Welsh Government has put forward more funding to councils to recruit a further 1,300 staff for the winter."

The return of piracy to the high seas demonstrates the limits of international law. The international community might agree that it is wrong to seize ships for ransom, but a few thugs with guns in Somalia beg to differ. Paper guarantees cannot stop seajackings.



Yet Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton wants Congress to ratify the Law of the Sea Treaty, the ultimate in paper guarantees. LOST, which essentially creates a second United Nations, is an artifact of the collectivist New International Economic Order popular in the 1970s, but it is being resold as a guarantor of freedom of the seas.



The convention obviously doesn’t do anything to prevent piracy. Moreover, the recent contretemps between the U.S. and Chinese navies demonstrates that LOST’s navigational guarantees are no more certain.





LOST was crafted to redistribute wealth from First World democracies to Third World autocracies. 



The USNS Impeccable, an unarmed spy ship, was operating 75 miles from China’s Hainan Island. Chinese vessels harassed the U.S. vessel and ordered it to leave, causing the U.S. Navy to send in a supporting destroyer.



Territorial waters extend just 12 nautical miles, but LOST empowers nations to exercise control over resources in the 200‐​mile Exclusive Economic Zone. Washington contends that U.S. ships are allowed to conduct activities “in waters beyond the territorial sea of another state without prior notification or consent,” according to Defense Department spokesman Stewart Upton. Beijing disagrees.



Washington would seem to have the better argument, though China’s contention that peaceful uses of the ocean do not include spying is plausible. Alas, LOST fails to offer the clear, unambiguous protection of navigational freedom as claimed by its proponents.



LOST largely codifies customary international law, which favors free transit. However, the treaty only offers a paper guarantee. Even if LOST recognizes the Impeccable’s right to spy, it offers no practical protection of that right.



If China — or Brazil, Malaysia or Pakistan, which also purport to forbid intelligence gathering within their exclusive zones — believes it to be in its interest and ability to prevent foreign passage, it won’t spend a lot of time parsing ambiguous LOST provisions before acting. Geopolitical interest and military capability, not juridical technicalities, will triumph.



The problem is likely to grow as Beijing develops a blue‐​water navy. Last month, Director of National Intelligence Dennis C. Blair told the Senate Armed Services Committee: “In the past several years, they have become more aggressive in asserting claims for the [exclusive zones] which are excessive under almost any international code.” Despite China’s adherence to LOST.



Although the treaty’s navigational benefits are more theoretical than real, LOST has significant downsides. Most important, the so‐​called Part XI governing seabed mining was amended in 1994, but the result is only less bad.



LOST was crafted to redistribute wealth from First World democracies to Third World autocracies. The International Seabed Authority would regulate private ocean development, mine the seabed itself through an entity called the Enterprise, and pay off favored nations and groups. Those objectives remain unchanged.



Moreover, treaty proponents talk excitedly about new litigation opportunities created by LOST. Professor William C.G. Burns of the Monterey Institute of International Studies wrote that the convention “may prove to be one of the primary battlegrounds for climate change issues in the future.” He dismissed the argument that the document does not authorize such litigation: “While very few of the drafters of [the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea] may have contemplated that it would one day become a mechanism to confront climate change, it clearly may play this role in the future.”



Environmental activists also look forward to using LOST Article 207, which directs countries to “adopt laws and regulations to prevent, reduce and control pollution of the marine environment from land‐​based sources.” Treaty advocates publicly claim the provision is merely hortatory.



Yet the mandate already has sparked litigation between Ireland and Britain. Moreover, Citizens for Global Solutions and the World Wildlife Federation argue that the convention will stop Russia from polluting the Arctic. They have yet to explain how LOST would bind Russia but not America.



No wonder Bernard H. Oxman of the University of Miami warned LOST backers to shut up about their plans. He explained: “Experienced international lawyers know where many of the sensitive nerve endings of governments are. Where possible, they should try to avoid irritating them.”



Finally, the United Nations proclaims that LOST is not “a static instrument, but rather a dynamic and evolving body of law that must be vigorously safeguarded and its implementation aggressively advanced.” If you like activist judges at the national level, imagine what you will get at the international level.



Before the Senate approves the Law of the Sea Treaty, members should consider the tradeoff they would be making. The convention offers paper benefits but imposes real costs. It’s a deal only a pirate could love.

"**The government has asked the regulator to assess the Oxford/AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine, bringing the UK a step closer to a possible rollout.**
The referral to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) marked ""a significant first step"" in getting the vaccine ""approved for deployment"", the government said.
It follows news that the jab was ""highly effective"" in advanced trials.
The UK government has pre-ordered 100m doses of the Oxford vaccine.
The government's latest request to the MHRA comes a week after the regulator was asked to assess the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.
Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the government was working ""tirelessly"" to be in the ""best possible position to deploy a vaccine"" as soon as one was approved by the MHRA.
""We have formally asked the regulator to assess the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, to understand the data and determine whether it meets rigorous safety standards,"" he added.
The Department of Health and Social Care said the UK would be one of the first countries in the world to receive the vaccine, if it was authorised, with AstraZeneca set to have as many as 4 million doses ready for the UK by the end of the year and 40 million by the end of March 2021.
The government has also ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine - which preliminary results showed stopped more than 90% of people developing Covid-19 symptoms.
If approved, a vaccine could be rolled out from December, Mr Hancock has said.
On Thursday, AstraZeneca said it was amending its study in the US following the accidental discovery that the vaccine appeared to perform best when a half dose was given followed by a full one, rather than two full doses.
It came after multiple news outlets in the UK and US reported that there were questions over the data on how effective the Oxford jab was.
Interim data from the trial showed three efficacy levels - an overall efficacy of 70%, a lower one of 62% and a high of 90%.
The company added that it was looking to get further confidence in the 90% efficacy found among volunteers who received the lower initial dose. It said it already had enough data from the trials to submit the vaccine for regulatory approval and would be doing this soon.
Read more on vaccine safety here.
Prof David Salisbury, former director of immunisation at the Department of Health, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that if the Oxford jab had 60% efficacy, while others had higher efficacy, then ""tough choices"" would have to be made.
""I think you have to think very carefully what we do with one hundred million doses of a product that isn't protecting as well as the alternative,"" he said.
Prof Salisbury suggested higher efficacy vaccines could be given to more vulnerable people while lower efficacy jabs could be given to under 55s.
The DHSC said the MHRA had already started a ""rolling review"" of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine and that once the regulator received the full safety, efficacy and quality data from the company, its scientists and clinicians ""stand ready to progress its assessment of the vaccine"".
Prof Helen Fletcher, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: ""It's not surprising if some manufacturing issues were still being ironed out when they started clinical trials but early stage trials are all about safety and the safety data we have seen has been very robust.""
She added that it was important to wait for the full dataset to be published."

What should a responsible Skeptic say to an astute audience? When recently invited by the “Technology, Engineering, and Science Plus” group in my community to give a talk and answer questions, I knew I would have an attentive room of tech-savvy professionals. However, they might not be fully tuned in to the details of the Global Warming controversy. Furthermore, they were likely to have opinions closer to the supposed “mainsteam science” orientation than mine.
In this posting, I’ve summarized the main points I think are most likely to align people who are both intelligent and reasonable to the Skeptic side. My Powerpoint (with talking points for each chart in the Notes section under each slide) is available [click here] for you to use and adapt as you wish.
Highlight scene from former VP Al Gore's Nobel and Oscar-winning movie, An Inconvenient Truth. Dramatic correlation between temperature and CO2 over past 600,000 years. Implication that global mean temperature rise will parallel CO2 increases. But, which way does the causation go? {Annotations by ira@techie.com, TVPClub.blogspot.com}
A. Basic Climate Science – Water vapor (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), and other “greenhouse” gases cause the Earth Surface to be warmer than it would be if the Atmosphere was just nitrogen. 

Light energy from the Sun warms the Earth System, which consists of our Atmosphere and the Surface. Based on satellite measurements, the Sun provides 1366 Watts per square meter (W/m^2) at the Top of the Atmosphere. After accounting for the Earth’s spherical shape and albedo (reflectiveness), the absorbed energy averages out to about 240 W/m^2 for each square meter.
To maintain a relatively constant mean temperature, Output Energy must equal Input Energy, so the Earth System must emit about 240 W/m^2 out to Space, which it does.
We call the Input Energy “light” because we can see (much of) it. We call the Output Energy “heat” because we can feel it. However, whether it is “short wave” energy from the very hot Sun, or “long wave” from the more moderate Earth System, we know that energy is fungible. 240 W/m^2 of one type is equal, power-wise, to 240 W/m^2 of the other. A Watt is a Watt, no matter what :^)
But, there is an “issue” – if we consider the Earth System as a “black body”, according to the laws of physics, for the Earth System to emit 240 W/m^2, it would have to be at a temperature of only 255 Kelvin, where Kelvins are degrees Celsius above absolute zero. (The Earth System is not exactly a black body, but it is close enough for our purposes here.)
You may remember that anything above absolute zero emits radiant energy and that 0.0 Kelvin corresponds to -273ºC or -460ºF. The “issue” is that the Earth Surface has a mean temperature closer to 288 Kelvin, corresponding to about +15ºC or +59ºF. In other words, the Surface is about 33ºC or 58ºF warmer than the “black body” formula would indicate. How to explain this added warmth?
The generally accepted explanation is the Atmospheric “greenhouse effect”. This is true science, but the name is somewhat misleading because a glass greenhouse works mostly by restricting convection while the Atmospheric effect works mostly by restricting radiation. I use “scare quotes” around “greenhouse” to acknowledge this semantic issue.
The Atmosphere passes most of the “short wave” energy from the Sun and absorbs most of the “long wave” energy from the Surface. The absorbed energy warms the Atmosphere and is re-emitted in all directions at a variety of “long wave” wavelengths. A portion of radiation from the Atmosphere passes out the Top of the Atmosphere to Space. A portion is emitted in the downward direction and is absorbed by the Surface. This absorbed radiant energy accounts for most of the extra 33ºC or 58ºF.
A variety of gases in the Atmosphere, primarily water vapor (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2), absorb and re-emit “long wave” radiation. These are called “greenhouse gases”.

B. Divergent Views – There is a valid, science-based argument between people I refer to as Warmists, Lukewarmers, and Skeptics. I distinguish their reasoned views from the far out, unscientific rantings of people I refer to as Alarmists and their equal and opposite reaction opponents, who I call Disbelievers.

VP Al Gore was not the first Alarmist, but his public lectures and his Nobel and Oscar-winning movie, An “Inconvenient” Truth, probably did more than anything else to bring Global Warming Alarmism to the fore in the consciousness of the major media and the general population.
The scene depicted above was the highlight of his presentation.
Gore displays the Ice Core record of the past 600,000 years for CO2 (red) and Temperature (blue). He points out the undoubted correlation between the two parameters. When one goes up so does the other. When one goes down, the other does as well. He points out that the then current CO2 level is considerably higher than that of the past 600,000 years, and he projects the future levels of CO2 assuming it continues to rise at current rates. So far, this is all true.
Dramatically ascending high above the stage on his motorized platform, he implies that mean temperatures will rise in proportion to the CO2. (My graphic is annotated in dashed blue to show the implied warming.) If that happens, he warns, more and more of the polar ice will melt, causing the seas to rise and flooding coastal areas. The ground under the polar ice will be exposed, further reducing the albedo of the Surface and causing further warming. We will reach a tipping point with runaway Global Warming.
The villain of Gore’s story is the human race and our habit of burning ever-increasing quantities of fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas) that release unprecedented amounts of CO2. This scene, more than any other event, is most likely responsible for the birth of what has come to be known as Catastrophic Anthropogenic Global Warming, CAGW. In other words, catastrophe due to human-caused Global Warming. It has become the mantra of the Alarmists and an excuse for governments to regulate all fossil fuels as well as land use that affects albedo. Since all industry and agriculture and civilized life itself depends upon fossil fuels and land use, the Alarmists give suitably oriented politicos an excuse to regulate and tax and restrict virtually everything. We outdoors types will need an indulgence from the government every time we pass wind. And, we can forget about lighting a campfire :^).
But, as the annotations in my graphic above show, there is a fundamental “Inconvenient” truth about the ice core data. It has absolutely nothing to say about the current Global Warming controversy! Gore was misleading the media and the public when he implied that rising CO2 levels would cause corresponding increases in mean temperatures. In particular, as any scientist who took a close look at the ice core data would see, and as I show in the inset graph in the upper left corner, Temperature always rises eight-hundred or more years before CO2 increases. The same is true in the other direction. The Temperature falls eight-hundred or more years prior to CO2 decreases. What this shows, if anything, is that TEMPERATURE CAUSES CO2, or, that something else causes both to change, with CO2 lagging by hundreds of years. Gore got the direction of causation backwards.
When the falsehood of this implied causation was pointed out, Gore’s apologists claimed that it was a minor matter and, after all, despite the 800-year lag, both Temperature and CO2 were up together and down together for about 5/6ths of the record. Besides, they said, we are currently burning historically unprecedented amounts of fossil fuel, and, we know that CO2 is a “greenhouse gas”, and so on and on. But, the truth is still that the ice core record is of a time when there were no humans to burn fossil fuels, so why did Gore bring it up since it has no relationship to our current situation? Raw, unfettered Alarmism has had its effect on the media, the political class, and we common citizens who have to pay the costs of the phony CAGW panic.
In politics, as in physics, every reaction has an equal and opposite reaction. In the Case of CAGW, that opposite (and equally false) reaction is what I call Disbeliever AGW or DAGW. These are people who use pseudo-scientific arguments in their claim that humans have had absolutely no hand in the mean temperature rise of the past century, or that there has been no temperature rise, or that the basic science of the Atmospheric “greenhouse effect” is untrue, and so on. I do not like to be to critical of the DAGW crowd because, when it comes to general political decisions, they are more likely than not to agree with me than my opponents, but my academic integrity and ethical duty as a licensed professional engineer require me to state what I see as the error of their arguments. (As I have in my WUWT Visualizing series [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
Having dismissed what I regard as the unscientific Alarmists and Disbelievers, that leaves us with three groups that, for the most part, use rational science-base arguments for their diverse views. Of course, every member of each group has somewhat different views, and any attempt to divide them into three distinct types is bound to cross some lines. So, please consider my grouping as approximate.
Carbon sensitivity, which is the estimate of how much mean temperatures will increase if CO2 doubles from historical or current levels, is one way to determine which of the the three groups a person belongs to. The Warmists tend to accept the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimate of 2.0ºC to 4.5ºC. The Skeptics tend to set carbon sensitivity much lower, perhaps 0.2ºC to 1ºC. The third group, which I call Lukewarmers, would suggest 1ºC to 3ºC.
How much of the rise in CO2 is attributable to human use of fossil fuels is also estimated differently. Warmists would blame humans for nearly all of it, while Skeptics would say less than half. Similarly, the blame for the supposed 0.8ºC rise in mean temperatures since 1880 is mostly attributed to human activities, while Skeptics say that data bias “adjustments” by the official climate record keepers is responsible for about a third of the supposed warming, and that natural cycles, over which humans have no control, are responsible for about half of it, leaving only 0.1ºC (or maybe up to 0.2ºC) to human responsibility. Lukewarmers are somewhere in-between.
Skeptics have well-justified suspicions that the official climate data keepers were “cooking the books” to lend whatever support they could to the highest estimates of carbon sensitivity. Around the year 2000, US Mean Temperature data was “adjusted” down by 0.1 to 0.2ºC for years prior to the 1970’s, and upwards by 0.2 to 0.3ºC for years after the 1970’s, increasing supposed warming by 0.3 to 0.5ºC.
The surfacestations.org project published photos of official temperature measurement stations that were very near artificial sources of heat, with most being in the lowest two of the five quality levels established by the government. The poor quality stations were compared to nearby well-located stations. There were large temperature deltas that could only be accounted for if the the stations now poorly-located were originally well-located, but had been influenced by nearby development, such as paved parking lots, buildings, and air conditioning vents.
According to a figure in the 1990 IPCC report, 1100 to 1300 AD saw temperatures in the northern hemisphere that were higher than current levels. However, the IPCC 2001 report included the infamous so-called “hockey stick” chart that managed to make the Medieval Warm Period of about 1000 years ago disappear! (My Powerpoint set includes charts with evidence of each of the aforementioned issues.)
These suspicions were not fully confirmed until 2009 when someone (probably an inside whistle-blower) released emails and computer code from the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) in the UK, and, later that year, a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request yielded a stash from the US NASA-GISS (Goddard Institute for Space Studies).

C. Climategate – UK Climatic Research Unit (CRU) emails and the US NASA GISS FOIA emails. What they tell us about the published Global Warming data. 
IPCC 1990 recognized Medieval Warm Period (MWP) temperatures were above current levels. IPCC 2001 used the ""Hockey Stick"" chart that makes MWP disappear.



I refer to the CRU as the Climategate Research Unit or, more simply, the Fudge Factory because the words “fudge factor” appear in their computer code. Phil Jones, PhD, is the CRU Director. He confirmed suspicions about the infamous “Hockey Stick” graph when, in an email, he called it “Mike’s Nature trick” (because a version of that graph appeared in a paper by Dr. Michael Mann in the prestigious journal Nature ). He also wrote that the “trick” was designed to “hide the decline” in tree ring proxy data. The tree-ring expert associated with CRU, Keith Brifa, PhD, admits, in one of the emails that “the recent warmth was probably matched about 1,000 years ago”. (My Powerpoint set includes slides with direct quotes from the Climategate materials.)

2007 email from Sato to Hansen details seven analyses of 1934 vs 1998. 1934 starts off with a 0.5ºC lead and ends up in a dead heat.

Moving on to the FOIA emails from GISS, it is interesting to note that their HQ, in New York City, happens to be in the same building as the famous restaurant where Jerry Seinfeld dined with George, Kramer, and Elaine. (It was never revealed what Kramer did for a living – perhaps he was the chief analyst at GISS :^)
The most revealing email from GISS is reproduced above. It was from Makiko Sato, PhD to her Boss, GISS-Director James Hansen, PhD, detailing the seven different analyses and comparisons of US mean temperatures for 1934 and 1998. The later year was the hottest in the 1990’s, so it was, let us say “inconvenient” that 1934, according to data published by GISS in 1999, was over 0.5ºC warmer. If Global Warming was almost entirely due to recent human activities, and was accelerating, how could the 1930 have been warmer?
Just as the Hockey Stick made the Medieval Warm Period disappear, GISS tried mightily to make 1934 cooler than 1998, but only succeeded in reducing the 0.5ºC lead into a dead heat. Notice that the 0.5ºC “adjustment” is more than half the supposed total warming since 1880.
I would like to trust the work of taxpayer-supported science, but, it seems, we must rely on President Reagan’s advice regarding the old Soviet Union, “Trust, but verify!”

D. What We Can and Should Do – Energy policy (cap and trade scam vs carbon tax). Efficiency, conservation, “green“, and renewable sources.

I am quite sure that Global Warming is REAL (i.e. the mean temperature of the Surface has increased by 0.5 to 0.6ºC since 1880) but, most of that increase is due to Natural Cycles over which we humans have no control.
However, the warming is PARTLY Due to Rising CO2 Levels and human actions are PART of the Cause.
There is not and never has been any real danger of catastrophe or even of serious net detriment to human life due to increased CO2 levels. Indeed, modest increases in these parameters are most likely a net benefit.
However, we Skeptics have to be realistic in the current political climate. Like it or not (and I do not like it) the official climate “Team” (i.e., the “Hockey Team” :^) has convinced the political and media establishment, and much of the population that something has to be done. We cannot fight something with nothing, so we need something more than a passive policy of do nothing because nothing is necessary.
Therefore, I favor reduction of the carbon footprint by efficiency, conservation, recycling, and so on, plus the introduction, if and when economically practical of so-called “Green” energy, including Nuclear, Water, Wind, Biomass and, particularly, “Clean” Coal.
If nothing else, these will do minimum harm and, if successful, will reduce US dependence upon foreign oil. We have spent, and continue to sacrifice too much blood and treasure protecting our access, and that of our allies, to energy from unstable regions of the world.
As for the Cap and Trade scam, it is a Politician’s Delight that rewards powerful Interests, wrecks the economy, and will NOT significantly reduce carbon emissions. It seems to me that some countries and US states that have adopted Cap and Trade have realized their folly and are backing away from it.
You may be surprised that I favor some version of a straight Carbon Tax, collected at the mine, well, and port, with the proceeds returned on an equal basis to citizens and legal residents. Yes, James Hansen and (pardon the expression Ralph Nader) also favor it, but, so do conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer, the Wall Street Journal, and others on the right. My support for this tax is based on what I wrote above, “We cannot fight something with nothing” and “We have spent, and continue to sacrifice too much blood and treasure protecting our access, and that of our allies, to energy from unstable regions of the world.”

I’m interested in your critique and comments. (My Powerpoint presentation is available [click here] for you to use and adapt as you wish..)

"**A hairdresser who council officials said repeatedly refused to shut during the Covid-19 lockdown has been forced to shut and is due in court.**
Sinead Quinn, owner of Quinn Blakey hairdressers in Bradford, ""repeatedly"" opened several times during lockdown, Kirklees Council said.
She is due before magistrates on Monday.
The council said Ms Quinn and customers who used the salon had been ""illegal, selfish and reckless"".
More Yorkshire stories
Hairdressers were required to close from 5 November under national lockdown restrictions.
Ms Quinn, who was issued with fines totalling Â£17,000 for repeatedly opening, was found to be trading again on Friday.
On Saturday the council submitted a closure notice meaning only the owner, occupier, or someone who lives at the premises could enter.
It also applied for a court order under the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 which if broken it meant an even higher fine and/or prison term.
Previously Ms Quinn said on Instagram she did not accept the fines issued since 9 November, and posted a notice on the salon door quoting the Magna Carta.
Councillor Paul Davies said the council sympathised with businesses suffering under lockdown restrictions but said ""public health must come first"".
""The actions taken by [Ms Quinn] and those who have given her custom during this period have been illegal, selfish and reckless,"" he said.
""[She] has wilfully endangered herself, her customers, the wider community and our staff.""
He said the pandemic had had a ""devastating"" impact on livelihoods and the council did not want to penalise businesses, but said the lockdown rules were needed to lower infection rates and save lives and Quinn Blakey was given ""every opportunity to do the right thing"".
""Public health must come first. We have been left with no choice,"" he said.

"**""I've been called a pandemic actor. I reply: 'I must be a good one as I let a doctor cut a hole in my throat'.""**
Jamie Branagan, 52, returned to care home nursing when the coronavirus pandemic broke out - but it was a decision that nearly cost him his life.
Mr Branagan spent a month in a coma and suffered a cardiac arrest, kidney failure and collapsed lung, after contracting Covid-19 himself.
He said he will never work again and wants to prevent more people dying.
""I've been trawling the internet looking for Covid deniers, trying to educate them. They are so indoctrinated. They see videos and think they are experts,"" said Mr Branagan, from Newport.
""It's a killer. A very good friend lost their father recently. People need to wake up.""
A leaflet containing coronavirus ""conspiracy theories"" and downplaying the pandemic as a hoax, was posted through Pembrokeshire letterboxes recently, leading Dyfed-Powys Police to issue a warning.
Health Minister Vaughan Gething described it as ""very worrying"", while Labour wants emergency laws to ""stamp out dangerous"" anti-vaccine content online.
Mr Branagan backed calls to bring those spreading misinformation to account, describing how his life as a fit and healthy man who played football until recently was changed forever.
He was born in London and had only ever wanted to work in the care sector, with some of his earliest memories those of driving around with his mother as she worked as a district nurse in Belfast and then Suffolk.
In 1999, Mr Branagan qualified as a mental health nurse, before moving up to a clinical lead role, which brought him to Newport in 2012 overseeing care homes.
This took him away from day-to-day care, and he was able to set up his own ""niche business"", trouble shooting, helping those in crisis to become compliant with rules and regulations.
But when a coronavirus pandemic looked imminent at the start of the year, he made the decision to go back into agency nursing to help out, adding: ""That's when my life changed.
""They (care homes) were like an elephant's graveyard. Vulnerable people who had tested positive were sent to die.""
""I get people want to return home to die in dignity, but to introduce such an infectious virus [to a care home], you are lighting the blue touch paper,"" he said.
""During the first wave, we didn't have the knowledge we have now... it was a tinderbox situation and it was always going to go.""
Mr Branagan said he does not blame authorities who were trying to cope with a situation that was quickly spiralling out of control, but does believe care homes were ""poorly supported"" at the start of the pandemic.
He described the spread of coronavirus as a question of ""when not if"", with vulnerable people - some with dementia - relying on face-to-face interaction, some wandering into other people's rooms and inadequate personal protective equipment.
""What can you do? You're on shift and people rely on you,"" he said.
""There was a lady who was dying, so I bent the rules so she could speak to her family one last time.
""This situation was not unique, but the son was able to say goodbye to his mum. She had no mask on and you're facilitating a FaceTime call.""
It was on 19 April Mr Branagan woke up three hours before a shift with pins and needles down the right side of his body and a headache, prompting him to self-isolate.
His partner Angharad, had also contracted coronavirus, but only experienced mild symptoms.
Mr Branagan, however, was taken to Newport's Royal Gwent Hospital, and on 30 April was placed in a coma while in respiratory arrest.
He woke up on 2 June, and spent 34 of 45 days ventilated in intensive care. He suffered a cardiac arrest, contracted two types of pneumonia, had acute kidney failure, sepsis, a collapsed lung and blood clots, and lost five stone.
His memories are based only on what his partner has told him, but said: ""I remember having vivid dreams, not very pleasant ones, they have stuck in my mind constantly.
""I then had to learn to walk, talk and eat again.""
Muscles in his fingers had wasted away to such an extent he could not hold a cup.
But while he needed glasses to drive before contracting coronavirus, Mr Branagan described his sight now being ""crystal clear"", as muscles had relaxed so much his eyes had fallen back into place.
He returned home on 9 June, and described the months since as ""a long struggle"" - coping with cysts on his lungs, suffering from fatigue and breathlessness.
Mr Branagan does not believe he will work again as he operates at 20% of his capacity.
""It's like the uninvited guest at a party. Smashes through your front door, drinks all your beer, wrecks your house, snogs your girlfriend then leaves,"" he said of the virus.
Mr Branagan praised intensive care unit staff that treated him. He called Dr David Hepburn ""an absolute legend"", adding: ""He's the reason I'm here today.""
Dr Hepburn was one of the first doctors to get ill from coronavirus in early March and has been outspoken, highlighting the risks to healthcare workers.
He described intensive care as being ""like a scene from a science fiction film"" and said everyone who has worked in hospitals during the pandemic will be changed.
The Welsh Government said: ""We understand this would have been a stressful and scary time, and a difficult one for this gentleman and his family. We are pleased he has recovered.
""Keeping care home residents and staff safe has always been a priority for the Welsh Government. We have put in place a wide range of support for care homes, including free PPE, additional funding and advice and guidance about infection control.
""Our programme of testing for care homes remains in place and no one can be discharged to a care home without testing negative for Covid-19. We will continue to work with all partners to minimise the risk of Covid-19 in care home residents and staff."""
"Up to a million species may go extinct due to human activity according to a recent report, some within decades. We all know the mammals in trouble – polar bears, giant pandas and snow leopards – but how many of us could name an endangered plant? A 2019 report assessed 28,000 plant species and concluded that about half of them were threatened with extinction. This failure to notice and appreciate plants has been termed “plant blindness”, and it’s particularly worrying because there are significantly more plant species at risk than mammals, despite the latter hogging most of our attention. Luckily, we developed a one minute cure for plant blindness that’s free and easy to do. Simply stop what you’re doing and look around. Are you in a room with wood or fibreboard floorboards or furniture? Do you see wallpaper, books or tissues? These are all made from plants. Your clothes may be made from plant fibres, such as cotton and linen. Perhaps you have food, fruit juice or a glass of wine nearby. Even if you’re in an office with plastic furniture, carpet tiles and wearing a polyester suit, these were made from oil generated over millions of years from plant and animal remains. Our lives are utterly dependent on plants, so why don’t we see them?  Our lack of appreciation for plants is a fairly recent thing. Our history tells a very different story. The dawn of farming around 12,000 years ago was when people became obsessed with growing plants for food, changing the way we live and our planet forever. Starting with domesticating cereals such as barley, rice and wheat, humanity’s increasing population and sedentary communities depended on their ability to farm, leading to entire civilisations focused on agriculture. Industrialisation and the more recent “green revolution” in agriculture led to incredible increases in cereal production and farming efficiency, allowing more people to live in cities rather than work on farms. Our agricultural success is a major reason why, for the first time in our history, most humans no longer farm, leaving people free to ignore our complete dependence on plants.  Tragically, our talent for farming has come at a huge cost to biodiversity. Right now, half of the habitable land on earth is used for agriculture, a major reason behind our current extinction crisis. Should we care about losing the diversity of plant species, as long as we are producing enough food? Absolutely. Plants are the major food producers in most ecosystems, providing nourishment and shelter to microbes, fungi, insects and animal species which themselves play key roles in ecosystems. While some creatures eat one type of plant – such as the bamboo-dependent giant panda – micro-organisms which live in the soil and make land fertile by recycling plant nutrients, perform better the more different plant species there are growing. Plant diversity also improves how much carbon is pulled from the atmosphere and stored in the soil – vital for mitigating climate change.

      Biodiversity collapse: the wild relatives of livestock and crops are disappearing


 The crops that feed us may increasingly depend on the survival of other plant species. Crops are vulnerable to disease and climate change, but wild and ancient species are often resistant to diseases and can grow on poor soils and in difficult environments. These plants will have genes that could make crops disease-resistant and allow them to grow in harsher conditions with less fertiliser and pesticide. We need this invaluable genetic heritage so that more people can continue to eat well in the future. Our health is also intimately connected with plant diversity. Just under half of all prescription medicines come directly from plants or by remaking plant chemicals. We’ve screened only a fraction of species for potential medicines – we don’t know how many useful plant chemicals and genes remain to be discovered. Even the most overlooked plants can be enormously important.  You might be surprised to learn that the species most studied to understand how plants work is a genus of tiny weeds called Arabidopsis. Most people have never heard of them and couldn’t identify them, even though they regularly pull them from their garden. By studying Arabidopsis, scientists learned how plants know when to flower, which is being used to improve our understanding of flowering in vegetable crops – key to improving their yield. They also learned how Arabidopsis defends itself from pathogens, which could be used to make crops resistant to disease. We can cultivate an appreciation of plants and their importance by improving access to parks, botanic gardens and forests, as well as including plant biology throughout the science curriculum in schools. But we also need to ensure there is a future for the thousands of species threatened with extinction. We need to produce more food on less land, so that natural habitats can thrive.

      We're conservation scientists – here's why we haven't lost hope for the future


 Plants could contribute even more to society’s needs in the future. Technologies already exist for making fuels and plastic from the agricultural waste of straw, grain husks and potato peel. These alternatives sadly won’t compete with cheap oil until we pay the full cost of our current lifestyles with a carbon tax. To avoid mass extinctions, we need transformative change in our politics, economics and technology to preserve and sustainably use the incredible natural resources that Earth provides. A painless first step towards making this change is something you could do every day: our one minute cure for plant blindness. If we stop, think and appreciate how plants enrich our lives, we will learn to respect our agricultural heritage and natural habitats and better manage the trade-offs between them."
"Extinction rebellion, the climate strikes, Greta Thunberg and even the BBC and Netflix have changed the conversation on climate change. Even more than I expected – there’s now a groundswell of public concern that human impact on the planet is unacceptable and we’re smart enough to correct it. I’m a climate scientist – and have been for 25 years – but I rarely take my work home. You don’t want to be the dad that goes home telling the family the world is screwed. So I was taken aback and pleasantly surprised when my 13-year old daughter Abbie said she wanted to go on the climate strike and asked if I would go with her.  Brilliant, I thought – and then there was that moment of doubt. Is this because of me? Have I influenced her in some way and she is doing this to please her dad? I decided to have a chat with her to find out why she is going to strike. Mark: Abbie, why do you want to go on strike? Abbie: Because the government isn’t doing anything about climate change. I want to convince people that global warming is more important than everything else. I’m protesting not just so the government does more but so that people will all do more, because climate change will impact our whole society. Melting ice caps, rising seas, hotter temperatures, coral bleaching, wild bush fires, storms, floods – but you know all of that. Mark: Where did you find out about climate and environmental change? Abbie: Well, school teaches us loads in science and geography lessons. I watch a lot of nature and science programmes and everyone knows about Greta. And if I’m really really stuck I can always ask you. Mark: What can you do to help fix our climate?

 Abbie: We can all save energy by switching off lights and computers when we don’t need them. We can turn down the heating and put on a jumper. We can recycle and reuse thing a lot more. I don’t need a new phone every year. If we use plastics less we can stop polluting the oceans and save all the oil we need to make them. And of course we can protest and make adults listen to us. Mark: What do you think adults should do to fix the climate? Abbie: I think everyone should have an electric car. It would make air pollution much better which is important, especially since I have asthma. People can get their electricity from renewables and they can fly less. Trains are great – why don’t we all use them? We can all eat less meat – there’d be less carbon and people would be more healthy. I don’t understand why people vote for politicians that won’t help them or the planet. Mark: Are you worried about what your school will do if you go on strike? Abbie: I told them I am going on the climate strike, but they haven’t replied. I think they’ll give me a detention but it’ll be worth it. It seems that the world doesn’t revolve around me – my daughter has been absorbing information for years and has come to her own conclusions. The climate strikes seem to empower young people who feel ignored. My daughter feels like she – and normal people like her – can make a difference. What most struck me was Abbie’s views on politicians, and her bewilderment at why leaders aren’t doing the right thing. Maybe her generation will demand better leaders – ones that really care about people and the planet, not just their strange, skewed political Game of Thrones. I must admit, interviewing my daughter was more stressful than interviewing Al Gore. Their views are similar, though my daughter has never heard of him. The new generation has new heroes and they aren’t us oldies who have failed to act. While doing this interview, I was struck by an old Hebrew proverb: The future of the Earth hangs on the breath of schoolchildren It seems the next generation is more globally minded and ecologically aware than any previous one. Maybe we should listen to their wisdom. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter. Climate change is inevitable. Our response to it isn’t."

THIS WEEK:
By Ken Haapala, Executive Vice President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP)
The past two weeks have been marked by several events that are causing considerable controversy in the global warming / climate change community. These events include the report on land surface temperatures from BEST, a book by Donna Laframboise on the IPCC, a paper by William Gray, and a paper claiming no major global climate change over the past 20,000 years followed by a compelling rebuttal.

*******
BEST Report: Richard Muller, the head of the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature (BEST) team, announced in a Wall Street Journal op-ed that BEST has submitted four articles for publication on its findings regarding the land surface temperature record. The article that garnered the greatest interest is the finding that the BEST results are consistent with the records reported by NOAA, Climatic Research Unit (CRU), and NASA-GISS, and that if there is an outlier it is NASA-GISS. BEST reports that the record shows a warming over the past two hundred years.
Perhaps because the press release was excessive, this announcement caused great controversy. But, as Fred Singer points out in his comments following an editorial in Nature, this should be no surprise because all groups, with some modifications, rely on the same basic data set – the Global Historical Climatology Network produced by NOAA’s National Climatic Data Center. Singer has further comments in an op-ed scheduled for publication early next week.
BEST is to be congratulated for undertaking its difficult task without government support or involvement of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Further, the team has posted its methodology and data for independent review – an action sorely lacking in climate science. Muller’s op-ed goes on to state that BEST drew no conclusions as to cause. The only record analyzed is the land surface record, not the atmospheric or sea surface record. Seas cover about 71% of the earth’s surface and will be the subject of the next project. Muller also stated that the human component in warming may be overstated.
Among the more surprising findings, subjects in separate papers, are that the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect is slight and that the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) may have a greater impact on land surface temperatures than the El Niño Southern Oscillation. No doubt the papers and the statistical techniques used will be subject to independent scrutiny. Ocean oscillations are ignored in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), the latest report.
Commentators in a number of newspapers, such as the Washington Post and other news media, immediately proclaimed that the BEST study is proof that those labeled climate skeptics / deniers are wrong and they are anti-science. In so doing, many of these commentators committed two major logical fallacies, the strawman argument and petitio principii. One, these commentators misstated the position of most skeptics who challenge the findings of the IPCC and state that climate / temperature change is normal and natural. Two, the commentators assumed that late 20th century warming is proof of human cause while the challengers demand compelling evidence that human emissions of carbon dioxide are the cause of 20th century warming.
Science is built using, among other tools, rigorous logic. Thus, those who use logical fallacies to label the skeptics / deniers as anti-science are, more correctly, labeling themselves.
Among other objections to the BEST reports, the Nature editorial, and several others, raised the fact that the findings were announced prior to publication in a peer reviewed journal. However, it is the policies of editors of Nature, and many other journals, that have lead to such actions. As evidenced by the difficulties that qualified researchers, such as Richard Lindzen and Roy Spencer, have in getting articles published, the editors of many journals block publication of studies that are contrary to their beliefs (that is, contrary to the pronouncements of the IPCC). Yet, Nature published the “hockey-stick” that directly contradicted a large body of prior scientific work. The fact that the BEST team is willing to make its methodology and data available to all who wish to analyze it, is a greater testament to the seriousness of the work than publication in a journal that reflects the beliefs of the editors.
As of this writing, some analysts are raising issues regarding the BEST data record, particularly the most recent data. On Tuesday, Fred Singer will raise issues concerning the data record at the Santa Fe conference noted above.

*******
Hidden Influence on the IPCC? Writer Donna Laframboise just published a book exposing the interrelationships among principal members of the IPCC and various environmental groups, such as the WWF (World Wildlife Fund) and Greenpeace. In principle, it is the quality of the work that matters, not the associations of the participants. It should not make any difference if the participants are associated with environmental groups, oil companies, tobacco companies, or whatever. But the associations should have been revealed.
Governments have spent tens of billions of dollars of public money based upon the findings of the IPCC. It is difficult to determine that if the governments had known of extensive involvement in the IPCC by those associated with environmental groups; the governments would have spent public funds so freely. Certainly, many of those demanding action on the IPCC’s questionable findings would not be doing so if the participants were associated with oil or tobacco companies.
Ms. Laframboise’s charges are serious, thus the evidence substantiating these charges must be serious. In an article published in the Financial Post, Laframboise accused Rajendra Pachauri of writing forewords to reports by Greenpeace and signing as IPCC Chairman, thus implying IPCC endorsement of the reports. There were direct links to the reports, substantiating the charges. In her review, Judith Curry states that the Kindle version of the book contains numerous links verifying the charges.
If the links in The Delinquent Teenager Who Was Mistaken for the World’s Top Climate Expert continue to substantiate the charges, then the book is starkly different from Merchants of Doubt. In the latter book, authors Naomi Oreskes and Erik Conway level very serious charges against four distinguished scientists, three of whom are dead. The authors fail to provide the evidence needed to substantiate the very serious charges. Instead, they cover their failure with extensive footnotes that do not directly address the issues. One book is an exposé, the other, a smear.
It should be remembered that IPCC Vice-Chair Jean-Pascal van Ypersele, who is associated with Greenpeace, tried to suppress Fred Singer’s talk in Brussels this past September, forcing a change in venue. IPCC Vice-Chair Jean-Pascal van Ypersele falsely claimed Singer is associated the fossil fuel industry.

Number of the Week: 15 out of 44 – 34%: The number of chapters in the IPCC – AR4 that at least one of the coordinating lead authors was affiliated with WWF (World Wildlife Fund) as reported by Donna Laframboise and cited by Judith Curry. Please see links under “Questioning the Orthodoxy.”
*******
Extreme Weather: In a privately produced paper, “Gross Errors in the IPCC – AR4 Report Regarding Past & Future Changes in Global Tropical Cyclone Activity,” noted tropical cyclone (hurricane) expert William Gray challenges the findings in AR4 that warming will produce more intense storms, especially tropical cyclones (which are called hurricanes in the Atlantic). Gray specifically rebuts numerous statements found in AR4, particularly in Chapter 3, “Observations: Surface and Atmospheric Climate Change.” The Coordinating Lead Authors of the chapter are Kevin Trenberth and Philip Jones. Both gained notoriety in the Climategate emails by expressing a willingness to suppress contradicting research.
Gray claims that none of the lead authors have a particular expertise in the field of tropical cyclones, and that many of the conclusions are contradicted by observations. Gray’s writing is quite blunt.
Hopefully, Gray’s paper will not be ignored because the issue is extremely significant and needs to be fully addressed. Organizations such as the US EPA have claimed that global warming endangers human health and welfare because, in part, it will result in more intense storms, especially hurricanes in the US.
Please see links under “Challenging the Orthodoxy.”
*******
20,000 Years of Climate Change: In a recent paper, Svante Björck states that over the past 20,000 years there has been no uniform, global warming and cooling until recently, thus human emissions of carbon dioxide must be the cause. As TWTW has pointed out, uniform global warming does not exist now. Thirty years of satellite measurements of atmospheric temperatures show the warming is concentrated in the northern part of the Northern Hemisphere, with little or no warming in the Tropics or the Southern Hemisphere.
Björck’s findings are contradicted by the large body of studies showing both a Medieval Warm Period and a Little Ice Age. These studies can be found in the NIPCC Reports 2009 and 2011 as well as the NIPCC web site and the web site of Sherwood, Craig, and Keith Idso, CO2 Science.org.
On the web site of Anthony Watts, Don Easterbrook produced the most devastating rebuttal. He shows a graph covering the last 20,000 years compiled from proxy temperature measurements from GRIP-2 ice cores taken in Greenland. The graph shows drastic, abrupt temperature changes for the periods immediately preceding, including, and immediately following the Younger Dryas. Directly contradicting Björck, Easterbrook then shows similar abrupt changes for the same period from ice cores taken from glaciers around the world. The graph of Greenland ice cores should be required viewing for anyone claiming 20th century warming is unprecedented.

Comment On The Quality Of The 2007 IPCC WG1 Report In Response To A Post On Climate Etc
By Roger Pielke, Sr, Pielke Climate Science, Oct 20, 2011 [H/t Marc Morano, Climate Depot]
http://pielkeclimatesci.wordpress.com/2011/10…
“The 2007 IPCC WG1 report ignored peer-reviewed papers which conflicts with their narrow focus on the radiative forcing of CO2 and a few other greenhouse gases.
The 2007 IPCC WG1, in my view, was a failure in the assessment of the understanding of the human role in the climate system, as well as the extent to which the natural forcings and feedbacks influence the climate.”

Cause and effect, or correlation not causation?
Press release Via Eurekalert:
Climate change causing demise of lodgepole pine in western North America
CORVALLIS, Ore. – Lodgepole pine, a hardy tree species that can  thrive in cold temperatures and plays a key role in many western  ecosystems, is already shrinking in range as a result of climate change –  and may almost disappear from most of the Pacific Northwest by 2080, a  new study concludes.

Including Canada, where it is actually projected to increase in some  places, lodgepole pine is expected to be able to survive in only 17  percent of its current range in the western parts of North America.
The research, just published in the journal Climatic Change,  was done by scientists from the College of Forestry at Oregon State  University and the Department of Forest Resource Management at the  University of British Columbia. It was based on an analysis of 12,600  sites across a broad geographic range.
Lodgepole pine ecosystems occupy large areas following major fires  where extreme cold temperatures, poor soils and heavy, branch-breaking  snows make it difficult for other tree species to compete. This includes  large parts of higher elevation sites in Oregon, Washington, the Rocky  Mountains and western Canada. Yellowstone National Park is dominated by  this tree species.
However, warming temperatures, less winter precipitation, earlier  loss of snowpack and more summer drought already appear to be affecting  the range of lodgepole pine, at the same time increasing the  infestations of bark beetles that attack this tree species.
The researchers concluded that some of these forces have been at  work since at least 1980, and by around 2020 will have decreased the  Pacific Northwest range of lodgepole pine by 8 percent. After that,  continued climatic changes are expected to accelerate the species’  demise. By 2080, it is projected to be almost absent from Oregon,  Washington and Idaho, some of the areas facing the most dramatic  changes.
“For skeptics of climate change, it’s worth noting that the increase  in vulnerability of lodgepole pine we’ve seen in recent decades is made  from comparisons with real climatic data, and is backed up with  satellite-observations showing major changes on the ground,” said  Richard Waring, an OSU distinguished professor emeritus of forest  science.
“This is already happening in some places,” Waring said. “Bark  beetles in lodgepole pine used to be more selective, leaving the younger  and healthier trees alone.
“Now their populations and pheromone levels are getting so high they  can more easily reach epidemic levels and kill almost all adult trees,”  he said. “Less frost, combined with less snow favors heavier levels of  bark beetle infestation. We’re already seeing more insect attack, and we  project that it will get worse.”
Some species are adapted to lower elevations, experts say, but  lodgepole pine is predominately a sub-alpine tree species. Its new  foliage can handle frost down to temperatures below freezing, it easily  sheds snow that might break the branches of tree species more common at  lower elevations, and it can survive in marginal soils.
But it makes these adaptations by growing more slowly, and as the  subalpine environment becomes less harsh, lodgepole pine may  increasingly be displaced by other species such as Douglas-fir, grand  fir and ponderosa pine, which are also more drought-tolerant.
As lodgepole pine continues to decline, one of the few places on the  map where it’s still projected to survive by 2080 is Yellowstone  National Park – a harsh, high-elevation location – and a few other  sub-alpine locations.
The species historically has played important ecological and  cultural roles. It provided long, straight and lightweight poles often  sought for tepees by Native American tribes, was later harvested  commercially for poles and fence materials, and offers cover and habitat  for big game animals.

Cooling via air-conditioning is a human right and must be powered from renewal energy sources. Thus says the UN, so “Comrade” Ardern will be on board with this. Landlords, start your engines …



As global temperatures reach record highs, **providing cooling systems which are effective, sustainable and which do not harm the environment is increasingly essential for everyday life.** That’s according to Rachel Kyte, Chief Executive Officer of Sustainable Energy for All, and Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General for Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL).



From the cold chain systems that maintain uninterrupted refrigeration during the delivery of food and vaccines, to protection from extreme heat waves globally – **access to cooling is a fundamental issue of equity** , and as temperatures hit record levels, for some, it can mean the difference between life and death. 



UN News asked Rachel Kyte why she is so passionate about cooling.



 **Cooling is essential to human health and prosperity**. As the world rapidly urbanizes, warms and populations grow, cooling is an urgent development challenge that has important ramifications for our climate. It requires **fast action to protect the most vulnerable** , and is vital for economic productivity by allowing workers, farmers and students to work in comfortable environments.



Yet as cooling needs rise, we must meet these challenges in an energy-efficient way, or the risks to life, health and the planet will be significant. At the same time, they provide equally important business opportunities for companies or entrepreneurs who can design and **produce hyper-efficient cooling devices at affordable prices for this rapidly growing market**.



A clean energy transition is already underway globally that can provide affordable, safe and **sustainable energy** for all. **We must now incorporate cooling for all needs within this transition** , while keeping us on track to reach our global climate and energy goals.



  
What a great idea, hugely increase the load on the electrical grid whilst simultaneously transitioning to unreliable electrical power sources. Gotta be a winner!

"Every country in the world would be economically better off if all could agree to strengthen their commitments on the climate crisis through international cooperation, new research has found. But if countries go no further than their current CO2 pledges – which are too weak to meet the goals of the Paris agreement, and would lead to dangerous levels of global heating – then they face steep economic losses.  The global economy would lose out by as much as $600tn (£476tn) by the end of the century, on current emissions targets, compared with its likely growth if countries meet the Paris goals, according to a paper published in the journal Nature Communications. If countries fail even to implement their current plans – which would lead to an estimated 3C (5.4F) of heating, far beyond the 2C or 1.5C settled on as the limit of safety in the 2015 Paris agreement – then the outlook is even worse, with losses of up to $800tn by 2100, according to the report from a group of scientists from the Beijing Institute of Technology and other mainly Chinese institutions. The study’s authors call their findings a “self-preservation strategy” for governments. They calculated the potential benefits by including the social welfare aspects of cutting emissions and of economic growth, which gives more weight than some other models to developing countries with large populations of poor and vulnerable people. They found that better international cooperation on emission would lead to better outcomes for such people, who are likely to be worst affected by climate breakdown. However, their findings also show such a strategy has greater benefits for developing countries with high emissions, such as India, Indonesia, Nigeria and China, than for developed countries such as the US and the EU in the medium term, though all benefit in the longer term. Their findings come at a critical time for governments around the world grappling with the coronavirus crisis, and its dire economic impacts. Many are under pressure to ignore or roll back previous commitments on the climate, and some stricken industries with high emissions – such as airlines and carmakers – have lobbied for a weakening of green measures. Oil producers have called a truce in their price war. But reneging on green commitments now only stores up future problems, and will hasten climate breakdown, scientists have warned, and any respite from rising emissions caused by the crisis will be only temporary. All countries are supposed to come forward with improved national plans on curbing greenhouse gas emissions this year, before vital UN climate talks aimed at keeping the Paris agreement on track. The UN and the UK government have been forced to delay the talks, called Cop26, until next year. That gives governments more time to improve their national plans, called nationally determined contributions in the UN jargon, but so far there is little sign they are doing so. Only Japan and Chile, the host of last year’s talks, among major countries have so far submitted fresh plans, and while Chile agreed to step up climate action, Japan’s plan showed no improvement. A UK government spokesperson for Cop26 told the Guardian: “We welcome Chile’s climate leadership as Cop25 president in submitting a strengthened emissions reduction target, and hope to see all countries following their lead.” Current climate plans showed that the rich world must do more, said Rachel Kennerley, climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth. “Budgets should be rebalanced to provide emergency finance and help poorer nations – it’s the fair and right thing to do. If we don’t pay now, this is the kind of bill that, like a person ignoring a credit card statement, will only multiply in time.  “And it’s the kind of expenditure that repays multiple benefits and should really be seen as a smart investment. As if stopping climate change isn’t enough, it will deliver a better quality of life for more people around the world, faster.” The economic benefits of curbing greenhouse gas emissions, compared with the high costs of reneging, should spur governments to act on the climate, according to the Nature study’s authors. However, investments are needed to realise these gains, particularly from developed countries. The outlay would amount to between $5tn and $33tn for the US, and between $16tn and $105tn for the G20 countries as a whole. The study said: “Early and quick action will provide a better chance to close the widening emissions gap, even though a large amount of abatement cost would occur in the short term.”"
"

25,000 bureaucrats, factota, hangers on, and representatives of various environmental organizations have just converged on Copenhagen for the UN’s latest “Conference of the Parties (COP) to its infamous 1992 climate treaty. Expect a lot of heat, not much light, and a punt right into our next election.   
  
  
President Obama says that the US will agree to a “politically binding” reduction of our emissions of carbon dioxide to a mere 17% of 2005 levels by 2050. This will allow the average American the carbon dioxide emission of the average citizen in 1867. Obama’s pronouncement has stepped all over the toes of the US Senate, which really doesn’t want to vote on similar legislation this election year. Jim Webb, a democrat heretofore very loyal to the President recently wrote Obama a very tersely worded note reminding him that the power to commit the nation to such a regulation lies with the Senate, not with the Commander‐​in‐​Chief.   
  
  
The UN’s own climate models show that even if every nation that has obligations under the failed Kyoto Protocol (which is supposed to be replaced by the Copenhagen Protocol) did what Obama wants, that only 7% of prospective warming would be prevented by 2100. The world’s largest emitter—China—was exempt then, and won’t agree to these reductions now.   
  
  
Instead they will agree to reduce “carbon intensity”—the amount of carbon dioxide emitted per unit GDP—by 20% per decade. This is nothing but business as usual for a developing or robust economy. In fact, when President George W. Bush said that was our global warming policy, he was roundly booed. The Chinese announcement—already telegraphed, is being greeted with unmitigated praise by the same environmentalists who beat on Bush for the exact same policy. India has just announced that there is no way that they will agree to any emission reductions unless we pay them lotsa money. Obama thinks that’s a good idea, too. Polling data, anyone?   
  
  
Since there’s no way that India and China will agree to large reductions, the real result of Copenhagen is that the climate can will be kicked down the road to the next COP, which begins on November 8, 2010, right down the road in Mexico City. That’s six days after our Congressional election, guaranteeing that cap‐​and‐​tax will be on the voters’ minds when they close the curtain on the current Congress.

Computer Room 1, University of East Anglia Jan 13, 2009 - somewhere in here is the email and the data
Guest Post by David M. Hoffer
Since both ClimateGate 1&2 there has been considerable confusion in regard to how the emails were obtained, how the FOIA requests were managed, and what was or wasn’t possible in that context.  There is no simple answer to those questions.
The ClimateGate emails span a period of nearly two decades.  During that time period, email systems evolved substantially in terms of technology, implementation, operational procedures, and the job descriptions of those responsible for them.  Other technologies such as backup systems, archive, and supporting technologies for legal compliance also changed (as did the laws themselves).  Saying exactly what was and wasn’t possible for such simple actions as deleting an email have completely different answers over time, and also based on the technology that was implemented at any given time.  With so many moving targets, it is impossible to draw any conclusions to a 100 percent certainty.
This article is written to cover the basics of how email systems and their supporting infrastructure work, and how they have evolved over time.  With that as a common background, we can then discuss everything from the simple questions regarding who could delete what  (and when), how the emails might have been obtained, and possibly most interesting of all, raise some serious questions about the manner in which the FOIA requests were handled at the CRU.

EMAIL 101
There are many, different email systems, and many different ways for end users to access them.  The basics are common to all of them however.  Each user has a “client” that allows them to access their email.  It could be an internet browser based client such as the ones used by Hotmail and Gmail, or it could be an email client that runs on your desk top computer like Outlook or Eudora.  For the purposes of this discussion I am going to discuss how things work from the perspective of an email client running on a desk top computer.
The email client connects an email server (or servers in a very large implementation).  To send an email to someone on a different email server, the two servers must “talk” to each other.  In most cases they do so over the internet.   How the clients interact with the servers however, is part of understanding why deleting an email that you sent (or received) is not straight forward.  The reason is that an email is never actually “sent” anywhere.  Once you write an email it exists on the disk drive of the computer the client software is installed on.  Press “send” and it goes….nowhere.  It is still there, exactly as it was before you “sent” it.
A copy however, has now been sent to the email server you are connected to.  That email server makes yet another copy and sends it to the email server the recipient is connected to.  That email server then makes still one more copy and sends it to the email client on the recipient’s computer, which in turn writes it to the local hard drive.  There are now a minimum of four copies of that one email.

But wait, there may be more copies.  When researchers first started exchanging information via email, they were commonly years ahead of the rest of the world.  Most large organizations had central IT shops, but they ran financial applications for the most part, email was a curiosity at best.  Many researchers were left to run their own email systems, and it wasn’t that hard to do.  Solaris was the UNIX operating system in vogue in those days, and Solaris came with a pretty good email system built in called Sendmail.  There were many other options too.  The bottom line was that early email systems were frequently run by researchers on their own computers.
As time went on, email became more common, and it became more important.  The volume of data, performance matters, and security were all becoming beyond the skill set of anyone but someone whose full time job it was to run IT (Information Technology) systems.  Researchers began giving up ownership of their own email system and central IT shops took over.  Email was becoming mission critical, and a lot of data was being stored in email systems along with records of contract negotiations and other important “paper” trails.  Losing email was becoming a painful matter if important information disappeared as a result.  As a consequence, the systems that protected the data on email systems also began to mature and be run professionally by IT departments.
The early email systems were just a single server with local hard drives.  As they grew in capacity and overall usage, plain old hard drives could no longer keep up.  Storage arrays emerged which used many hard drives working together to increase both capacity and performance.  Storage arrays also came with  interesting features that could be leveraged to protect email systems from data loss.  Two important ones were “snapshots” and “replication”.
Snapshots were simply point in time copies of the data.  By taking a snapshot every hour or so on the storage array, the email administrator could recover from a crash by rolling back to the last available snapshot and restarting the system.  Some storage arrays could handle keeping a few snapshots, others could maintain hundreds.  But each snapshot was actually a full copy of the data!  Not only could a storage array store many copies of the data, consider the question of deletion.  If an email was received and then deleted after a snapshot, even by the central IT department itself, the email would still exist in the last snapshot of the data, not matter what procedure was used to delete it from the email system itself.
What if the storage array itself crashed?  Since the storage arrays could replicate their data to other storage arrays, it wasn’t uncommon to have two arrays and two email servers in a computer room so that no matter what failed, the email system could keep on running.  What if the whole computer room burned down?  Replication to another storage array at a completely different location is also very common, and should the main data centre burn down, the remote data centre would take over.  Keep in mind as you think this through that the ability of the storage arrays to replicate data in this fashion is completely and totally independent of the email system itself.
Early email systems were, as mentioned before, most often a single server with internal hard drives.  A modern “enterprise class” email system would be comprised of many servers and storage arrays more like this:

If you recall that just sending an email makes, at minimum, four copies, consider what “one” copy on a large email system actually translates to.  In the figure above, there are two copies on the storage arrays in the data centre.  If snapshots are being used, there may be considerably more.  Plus, there is at least one more copy being replicated to a remote data center, which also may have regular snapshots of data.  That’s a LOT of copies of just one email!  And we haven’t even started talking about backup and archive systems yet.
Let’s return to the question of deleting email.  It should be plain to see that in terms of current email technology, deleting an email just from the email system itself is not a simple task if your intention is to erase every single copy that ever existed.
As an end user, Phil Jones is simply running an email client connected to an email server run by somebody else.  He has no control over what happens on the server.  When he deletes an email, it is deleted from his email client (and hence the hard drive on his computer), and from his view of his emails on the email server.  Technically it is possible to set up the email server to also delete the email on the server at the same time, but that is almost never done, and we’ll see why when we start discussing backup, archive, and compliance.
On the other hand, are we talking about what was most likely to happen when Phil Jones deleted an email in 2009?  Or what was most likely to happen when Phil Jones deleted an e-mail in 1996?  The answers would most likely be entirely different.  In terms of how email systems have been run in the last ten years or so however, while it is technically possible that Phil Jones hit delete and erased all possible copies of the email that he received, this would have done nothing to all the copies on the sender’s desk top and on the sender’s email server… and backup systems.  Let’s jump now into an explanation of additional systems that coexist along with the email system, and make the possibility of simply deleting an email even more remote.
Backup Systems
Just as we started with email and how it worked at first and then evolved, let’s trace how backup systems worked and evolved.  There are many different approaches to backup systems, but I’ll focus here on the most common, which is to make a copy of data to a tape cartridge.
At first, backup was for “operational” purposes only.  The most common method of making a backup copy of data for a server (or servers) was to copy it to tape.  The idea was that if a disk drive failed, or someone deleted something  inadvertently, you could restore the data from the copy on tape.  This had some inherent problems.  Suppose you had a program that tracked your bank account balance.  But for some reason you want to know what the bank account balance was a week ago, not what it is today.  If the application didn’t retain that information, just updated the “current” balance as it went, you would have only one choice, which would be to restore the data as it existed on that specific day.  To do that, you’d need one tape for each day (or perhaps one set of tapes for each day in a larger environment).  That starts to be a lot of tape fast.  Worse, as data started to grow, it was taking longer to back it up (and the applications had to be shut down during that period) and the amount of time at night where people didn’t need their applications running kept shrinking as companies became more global.
Several approaches emerged, and I will be covering only one.  The most common  by far is an approach called “weekly full, daily incremental”.  The name pretty much describes it.  Every weekend (when the backup window is longest), a full copy of the data is made to tape.  During the week, only what changed that day is copied to tape.  Since changes represent a tiny fraction of the total data, they could be run in a fraction of the time a full copy could.  To restore to any given day, you would first restore the last “full copy” and then add each daily “incremental” on top until you got to the day you wanted.
This worked fine for many organizations, and larger ones bought “tape libraries” which were exactly what they sound like.  They would have slots for dozens, sometimes hundreds, of tape cartridges, several tape drives, and a robot arm that could change tapes for both backup processes and for restore processes.  The problem was that the tape library had to be as close as possible to the servers so that data could be copied as fast as possible (performance degrades sharply with distance).   The following depicts the email system we’ve already looked at, plus a tape backup system:

By making regular copies of data to tape, which was a fraction of the cost of disk storage, the IT department could have copies of the data, exactly as it existed on any given day, and going as far back as the capacity of the tape library (or libraries) would allow.  Now try deleting an email from say a year ago.  In addition to all the copies on disk, there are at least 52 copies in the tape library.  Since we have a tape library however, it is easy to make still more copies, automatically, and most organizations do.
Disaster Recovery
What if there was a major flood, or perhaps an earthquake that destroyed both our local and remote data centers?  In order to protect themselves from disaster scenarios, most IT shops adopted an “off site” policy.  Once the backup was complete, they would use the copy of the data on tape to make… another copy on tape.  The second set of tapes would then be sent to an “off site” facility, preferably one as far away as practical from the data centers themselves.

Consider now how many copies of a given email now exist at any given time.  Unlike that financial application whose “current account balance” is constantly changing, email, once received, should never change.  (But it might which is a security discussion just as lengthy as this one!).  Provided the email doesn’t change, there are many copies in many places, and no end user would have the security permissions to delete all of them.  In fact, in a large IT shop, it would take several people in close cooperation to delete all the copies of a single email.  Don’t organizations ever delete their old data?
Data Retention
The answer to that question can only be answered by knowing what the data retention policy of the organization is.  Many organizations just kept everything until the cost of constantly expanding their storage systems, tape libraries and the cost of housing off site tapes started to become significant.  Many organizations decided to retain only enough history on tape to cover themselves from a tax law perspective.  If the retention policy was implemented correctly, any tapes older than a certain period of time would be removed from the tape library and discarded (or possibly re-used and overwritten).  The copies in the offsite storage facility would also be retrieved to be either destroyed or re-used so that the offsite data and he onsite data matched.
Archive
As email systems grew, the backup practices described above became problematic.  How long people wanted to keep their email for was often in conflict with the retention periods for financial purposes.  They were designed for general purpose applications with ever changing data.  As the amount of data in an email system started to grow exponentially due to ever larger attachments, graphics, and volume, the expense and pressure on even an “incremental” backup window became enormous.  That’s where archive started to emerge as a strategy.  The storage arrays that supported large email systems were very expensive because they had to be ultra reliable as well as ultra high performance.  But 99% of all emails were being read on the day they were sent… and never again.  Only if something made an older email important… evidence of who said what and when from a year ago for example, would an email be accessed again after it was a few days old.  So why house it on the most expensive storage the organization  owned?  And why back it up and make a copy of it every week for years?
Many organizations moved to an “archive” which was simply a way of storing email on the cheapest storage available.  If someone needed an email from a year ago, they would have to wait minutes or perhaps hours to get it back.  Not a big issue provided it didn’t need to be done very often.  Some organizations used low performance low cost disk, some even went so far as to write the archive to tape.  So, for example, the email you sent and received in the last 90 days might open and close in seconds, but something from two years ago might take an hour.  Not only did this reduce the cost of storing email data, but it had the added benefit of removing almost all the email from the email system and moving it to the archive.  Since the archive typically wasn’t backed up at all, the only data the backup system had to deal with in its weekly full daily incremental rotation was the last 90 days.  This left an email system, with the integrated backup and archive systems, looking something like this:

For most IT shops, if you ask them how many copies of a given email they have if it was sent a year ago, they can’t even answer the question.  Lots.
What does that mean in terms of FOIA requests?  Plenty.
Compliance
The world was rolling along quite nicely using these general techniques to protect data, and then the law got involved.  Enron resulted in Sarbanes Oxley in the United States and similar laws in other countries  FOIA came in existence in most western countries.  Privacy laws cropped up.  Suddenly IT had a new problem, and a big one.  The board of directors was suddenly asking questions about data retention.  The IT department went from not being able to get a meeting with the board of directors to having the board shining a spot light on them.  Why?
Because they (the board of directors) could suddenly go to jail (and some did) because of what was in their email systems.  Worse, they could even go to jail for something that was NOT in their email system.  The laws in most jurisdictions took what you could delete, and what you could not delete, to a whole new level.  Worse (if you were a member of the board of directors) you could be held responsible for something an employee deleted and shouldn’t have…. or didn’t delete and should have.  Bingo.  The board of directors is suddenly no longer interested in letting employees decide what they can and cannot delete, and when.  The same applied in most cases to senior management of public institutions.
Back to the original question.  Could Phil Jones have deleted his emails?  When?  In the early days when his emails were all in a server run by someone in his department?  Probably.  When the email system moved to central IT and they started backing it up regularly?  No.  He would only be able to permanently delete any given email provided that he had access to all the snapshot copies on all the storage arrays plus the archive plus all the backup tapes (offsite and onsite).  Fat chance without the express cooperation of a lot of people in IT, and the job of those people, based on laws such as FOIA, SOX and others was to expressly prevent an end user such as Phil Jones from ever doing anything of the sort, because management had little interest in going to jail over something someone else deleted and shouldn’t have.
So…did CRU have a backup system?  Did they send tapes off site?  Did they have a data retention policy and what was it?  Did they have an archive?  If they had these things, when did they have them?
With all that in mind, now we can look at two other interesting issues:

What are the possible ways the emails could have been obtained?
Were the proper mechanisms to search those emails against FOIA requests followed?

Short answer: No.
In terms of how the emails could have been obtained, we’ve seen various comments from the investigation into ClimateGate 1 that they were most likely obtained from accessing an email archive.  This suggests that there at least was an email archive.  Without someone laying out a complete architecture drawing of the email systems, archive system, backup system, data retention policies and operational procedures, we can only guess at how the system was implemented, what options were available, and what options not.  What we can conclude however is that at some point in time, an archive was implemented.  Did it work like the description above about archives?  Probably.  But there are many different archive products on the market, and some IT shops refer to their backup tapes as an archive just to confuse matters more.
In addition, without knowing how the investigators came to the conclusion that the emails were obtained from the archive, we don’t have any way to assess the quality of their conclusions.  I’m not accusing them of malfeasance, but the fact is without the data, we can’t determine if the conclusions are correct.  Computer forensics is an “upside down” investigation in which the “evidence” invariably points to an innocent party.  For example, if someone figured out what Phil Jones username and password was, and used them to download the entire archive, the “evidence” in the server logs would show that Phil Jones did the deed.  It takes a skilled investigator to sort out what Phil Jones did (or didn’t do) from what someone using Phil Jones credentials did (or didn’t do).  So let’s put aside what the investigators say they think happened and just take a look at some of the possibilities:
Email Administrator – anyone who had administration rights to the email system itself could have made copies of the entire email database going back as far as the oldest backup tapes retained with little effort.  So…who had administration rights on the email system itself?  There’s reason to believe that it was not any of the researchers, because it is clear from many of the emails themselves that they had no idea that things like archives and backup tapes existed.
Storage Administrator – In large IT shops, managing the large storage arrays that the application servers are attached to is often a job completely separate from application administration jobs such as running the email system.  Since the storage administrator has direct access to the data on the storage arrays, copying the data from places such as the email system and the archive would be a matter of a few mouse clicks.
Backup Administrator – This again is often a separate job description in a large organization, but it might be rolled in with storage administration.  The point being however, that whoever had backup administration rights had everything available to copy with a few mouse clicks.  Even in a scenario where no archive existed, and copying the data required restoring it from backup tapes that went back 20 years, this would have been a snap for the backup administrator.  Provided that the tapes were retained for that length of time of course, the backup administrator could simply have used the backup system itself, and the robotics in the tape library, to pull every tape there was with email data on it and copy the emails to a single tape.  This is a technique called a “synthetic full” and could easily run late at night when it would just look like regular backup activity to the casual observer.  The backup administrator could also “restore” data to any hard drive s/he had access too… like their personal computer on their desk.
Truck Driver – yes, you read that right, the truck driver.  Google keywords like “backup tapes stolen truck” and see what you get.  The results are eye popping.  The companies that specialize in storing tapes off site for customers send a truck around on a regular basis to pick up the weekly backup tapes.  There have been incidents where entire trucks (and the tapes they were carrying) were stolen.  Did anyone steal CRU’s tapes that way?  Probably not.  The point is however that once the tapes leave your site and are entrusted to another organization for storage, they could be copied by anyone from the truck driver to the janitor at the storage site.  Assembling 20 years of email from backup tapes could be a real hassle of course.  On the other hand, an offsite storage facility frequently has as part of the service it provides to clients…great big tape libraries for automating copying of tapes.   Encryption of backup tapes was a direct response to incidents in which tapes with valuable (and/or embarrassing information) wound up in the wrong hands.
But encryption has only been common for a few years.  That raised an interesting theoretical question.  The last email release ends in 2009, and the rest of the release is, in fact, encrypted.  One can only wonder, does the CRU encrypt their backup tapes, and if so, when did they start doing that?
Administrative Foul Up – One of the biggest “cyber crimes” in history occurred when a company doing seismic processing for oil companies cycled the tapes back to their customers for the next round of data, and sent old tapes to different customers.  One of their customers figured it out, and started checking out the data they were being sent which was from their competitors.  It wasn’t the first time it happened, and it wasn’t the last time.
Janitor – Let’s be clear, I’m not accusing anyone, just making a point.  There’s an old saying about computer security.  If you have physical access, then you have access.  Anyone with physical access to the computer room itself, and the right technical skills, could have copied anything from anywhere.
The FOIA Requests
There are dozens of emails that provide glimpses into both how the email systems at CRU were run, and how FOIA requests were handled.  Some of them raise some very interesting questions.  To understand just how complex compliance law can be, here’s a brief real world story.  Keep in mind as you read this that we’re talking about American law, and the CRU is subject to British law which isn’t quite the same.
In the early days of compliance law, a large financial services firm was sued by one of their clients.  His claim was that he’d sent instructions via email to make changes to his investment portfolio.  The changes hadn’t been made and he’d suffered large losses as a result.  His problem was that he didn’t have copies of the emails he’d sent (years previous) so his legal case was predicated upon the financial firm having copies of them.  To his chagrin, the financial firm had a data retention policy that required all email older than a certain date to be deleted.  The financial firm figured they were scot free.  Here’s where compliance law starts to get nasty.
A whistle blower revealed that the financial firm had been storing backup tapes in a closet, and had essentially forgotten about them.  A quick inspection revealed that a number of the backup tapes were from the time in question.  The financial services firm asked the judge for time to restore the data from the tapes, and see what was on them that might be relevant.  The judge said no.
The judge entered a default judgment against the financial services firm awarding the complainant  $1.3 Billion in damages.  The ruling of the court was that the financial services firm was guilty by virtue of the fact that they had told the court the data had been deleted from that time period, but it hadn’t been.  They had violated their own data retention policies by not deleting the data, and were guilty on that basis alone.  Wake up call for the financial industry…and everyone else subject to compliance law, which includes FOIA requests.
Suddenly deleting information when you said you hadn’t was a crime.  Not deleting information when you said you had, was a crime.  Keeping information could wind up being used against you.  Not keeping information that it turns out you were required to keep (by the tax department for example) could be used against you.  No one serious about compliance could possibly take the risk of allowing end users to simply delete or keep whatever they wanted.  From their own personal accounts certainly, but not from the company email server.  Ever.
In that context, let’s consider just a few words from one email in which Phil Jones, discussing with David Palmer whether or not he’d supplied all the email in regard to a specific FOIA request, says “Eudora tells me…”
These few words raise some serious questions.  Eudora is an email client, similar to the more familiar Outlook.  So, let us ask ourselves:
Why was David Palmer relying on Phil Jones to report back all the emails he had?  Compliance law in most countries would have required that David Palmer have the appropriate search be done by the IT department.  This would have captured any emails deleted by Phil Jones that were still retained by the CRU based on their data retention policy.
Was David Palmer aware of the proper procedure (to get the search done by IT)?  If not, was he improperly trained and who was responsible for properly training him in terms of responding to FOIA requests?  If he was aware… well then why was he talking to Phil Jones about it at all?
Phil Jones specifically says that “Eudora tells me” in his response to Palmer.  Since Phil Jones evidently did the search from his own desk top, the only emails he could search for were ones that he had not deleted.  But, that doesn’t mean he found all the emails subject to the FOIA request, because email that he did delete was more than likely retained on the CRU email server according to their data retention policies.  As in the case of the financial company, the CRU may well have said they didn’t have something that they did.  In fact, we can surmise this to be highly likely.  There are multiple emails showing up in which, for example, Phil Jones says he is going to delete the message right after sending it.  But we now have a copy of that specific message.  Did he send it and then forget to delete it?  Probably not.  The more likely answer is that he did delete it, not realizing that the CRU data retention policy resulted in a copy being left on the server.  If the CRU responded to an FOIA request and didn’t include an email that met the FOIA parameters because they failed to search all their email instead of just the email that Phil Jones retained in his personal folder… well, in the US, there would be some prosecutors very interested in advancing their careers…
“Eudora tells me” is even more curious from another perspective.  Why “Eudora”?  Why didn’t he say that he’d searched all his email?  Why specify that he’d used the search capabilities in Eudora?  Personally, I have three email systems that I connect to, and a different email client for each one.  Searching all my email and searching all my email in just one email client are two completely different things.  Most interesting!
While I am comfortable discussing with IT shops how to architect email systems to protect data and properly service legal requirements such as FOIA requests, I have to admit that I wouldn’t know where to start in terms of submitting one.  If I did, I just might ask for all the emails they have pertaining to FOIA requests, and I’d be specific about wanting all the email, regardless of it being in the main email system, the archives, or on backup media, and all the email that ever existed, regardless of having been deleted by end users.  Then for the capper, I’d ask for their data retention policy and see if they managed to meet it in their response.
Just sayin’

Newsbytes from Dr. Benny Peiser at The Global Warming Policy Foundation 
 
A diplomatic cable published last month by the WikiLeaks website reveals that most of the UN’s Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects in India should not have been certified because they did not reduce emissions beyond those that would have been achieved without foreign investment. Indian officials have apparently known about the problem for at least two years. The revelations imply that millions of tonnes of claimed reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions are mere phantoms, she says, and potentially cast doubt over the principle of carbon trading. —Quirin Schiermeier, Nature News, 27 September 2011 

 
But one must say clearly that we redistribute de facto the world’s wealth by climate policy. Obviously, the owners of coal and oil will not be enthusiastic about this. One has to free oneself from the illusion that international climate policy is environmental policy. This has almost nothing to do with environmental policy anymore. –Ottmar Edenhoffer, Neue Zürcher Zeitung, 14 November 2010 
 
North Sea gas production has slumped by 25% in the second quarter of the year, an alarming increase in the rate of decline that will cut tax revenues and could put more pressure on government to agree controversial shale gas developments. —Terry Macalister, The Guardian, 30 September 2011 
 
The costs of Alex Salmond’s green energy revolution are “going through the roof” and threaten to bankrupt companies by doubling energy bills, business leaders have warned the First Minister. The Scottish Chambers of Commerce (SCC) said electricity is currently about nine times more expensive to generate from wind farms than gas-powered plants. It warned this would hold back the Scottish economy and lead to businesses going under. –Simon Johnson, The Daily Telegraph, 29 September 2011 
 
 
 
Poland would veto any EU legislation that threatened its sovereignty in energy policy, Maciej Olex-Szczytowski, an adviser to the Polish foreign minister on economics and business, said yesterday. —Bloomberg, 28 September 2011 
 
In an age of austerity, cheap gas—domestically produced and available in large quantities—could be a major tool for restoring European prosperity. It allows EU member states to directly tackle their alarming growth of fuel poverty while providing a new means to help rebuild competitiveness. That is an investment no country in Europe can afford not to make. –-Alan Riley, The Wall Street Journal, 30 September 2011 
The shale boom of oil & gas is one of the few bright spots in the Obama economy. So it seems more than a bit paradoxical that Obama’s EPA and Department of the Interior continue working in attempts to find an excuse to shut it down — or at least slow it to a crawl. —Al Fin Energy, 29 September 2011

President Trump has repeatedly cited drug smuggling to justify a border wall. Because it is difficult to conceal, marijuana is the main drug transported between ports of entry where a border wall would matter. However, Border Patrol seizure figures demonstrate that marijuana flows have fallen continuously since 2014, when states began to legalize marijuana. After decades of no progress in reducing marijuana smuggling, the average Border Patrol agent between ports of entry confiscated 78 percent less marijuana in fiscal year (FY) 2018 than in FY 2013. 



As a result, the value of all drugs seized by the average agent has fallen by 70 percent since FY 2013. Without marijuana coming in between ports of entry, drug smuggling activity now primarily occurs at ports of entry, where a border wall would have no effect. In FY 2018, the average inspector at ports of entry made drug seizures that were three times more valuable overall than those made by Border Patrol agents between ports of entry — a radical change from 2013 when Border Patrol agents averaged more valuable seizures. This is because smugglers bring mainly hard drugs through ports. By weight, the average port inspector seized 8 times more cocaine, 17 times more fentanyl, 23 times more methamphetamine, and 36 times more heroin than the average Border Patrol agent seized at the physical border in early 2018.



Given these trends, a border wall or more Border Patrol agents to stop drugs between ports of entry makes little sense. State marijuana legalization starting in 2014 did more to reduce marijuana smuggling than the doubling of Border Patrol agents or the construction of hundreds of miles of border fencing did from 2003 to 2009. As more states — particularly on the East Coast — legalize marijuana in 2019, these trends will only accelerate. The administration should avoid endangering this success and not prosecute state‐​legal sellers of marijuana. This success also provides a model for addressing illegal immigration. Just as legalization has reduced the incentives to smuggle marijuana illegally, greater legal migration opportunities undercut the incentive to enter illegally. Congress should recognize marijuana legalization’s success and replicate it for immigration.



Cross‐​border drug smuggling is a primary justification for President Trump’s calls to hire 5,000 additional Border Patrol agents and build a massive border wall. However, the evidence indicates that legalization of marijuana has more effectively controlled the illegal trafficking of marijuana than interdiction and enforcement alone. From 2003 to 2009, Border Patrol doubled its agents, constructed more than 600 miles of fencing, and introduced new surveillance technologies. Despite this, the annual rate of marijuana seizures between ports of entry by Border Patrol remained unchanged at about its average of 115 pounds per agent through FY 2013.



Following the full legalization of marijuana sales in six states beginning with Colorado and Washington in FY 2014, the rate of seizures by Border Patrol declined 78 percent, from 114 pounds per agent in FY 2013 to 25 pounds per agent in FY 2018. Total marijuana seizures by all Department of Homeland Security (DHS) agencies declined by nearly 2 million pounds from FY 2013 to FY 2017. Other drugs have not entirely substituted for this decline in marijuana. The street value of all drugs seized by the average agent between ports of entry also fell by 70 percent from FY 2013 to FY 2018.



Today, a border wall would have little effect on the most valuable drug smuggling. In FY 2018, the average inspector at ports of entry made drug seizures valued at about $71,000, while the average Border Patrol agent made seizures valued at just $23,000. Moreover, if the goal is to target “hard” drugs, spending resources between ports of entry would also be less effective than at ports of entry. Excluding interior checkpoints, Border Patrol agents between ports of entry accounted for just 8 percent of hard drug seizures by value in 2018.



Marijuana legalization provides a model for dealing with illegal border crossers. Legalizing immigration of lesser‐​skilled workers has similarly helped control human smuggling and illegal migration more effectively than immigration enforcement alone. During the last 60 years, a 10 percent increase in the number of guest worker admissions was associated with an almost 9 percent decrease in apprehensions per agent. From 1986 to 2017, the number of guest worker admissions increased twentyfold, while the number of apprehensions per agent declined 97 percent.



These findings call into question the efficacy and necessity of constructing physical barriers and surging additional border agents to control the flow of drugs and people _between_ ports of entry. Instead, they indicate that a better approach to managing human and drug smuggling would be to hire more officers at ports of entry, increase legal channels for migration, and legalize marijuana nationwide. These alternative strategies have proved more effective than enforcement alone.



The federal government currently prohibits the production, sale, and possession of marijuana (cannabis) by classifying it as a Schedule I drug, defined as “drugs with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.”1 Despite federal prohibition of marijuana, the United States has one of the highest use rates in the world, with nearly half of Americans reporting that they have consumed it at some point in their lives.2 Almost 36 million Americans used marijuana in 2016, and the total marijuana market is valued at roughly $56.1 billion.3



For decades, state laws complemented federal marijuana prohibition with separate state penalties. Starting in 2014, however, six states have allowed fully legalized recreational marijuana sales for adults for the first time since prohibition began in the 1930s (Figure 1).4 Washington and Colorado first opened legal dispensaries in 2014. Oregon followed in July 2015, Alaska in October 2016, Nevada in July 2017, and California in January 2018. Maine and Massachusetts have also voted to legalize commercial marijuana sales, though delays in implementing regulations and issuing licenses will prevent any sales in those states until 2019. In 2018, Michigan voted to legalize recreational marijuana, with the first legal sales expected in 2020.5



 **Figure 1: States with legal marijuana sales**  
  




 **Source:** National Council of State Legislatures, “Marijuana Overview,” November 13, 2018.



As of September 2018, one in six Americans lived in states with legal marijuana, and one in four lived either in or next to states with legal marijuana sales.6 After legal sales open in Michigan, Massachusetts, and Maine, nearly one in four will live in states with legal sales, and almost two in three will either live in or next to those states.



While state‐​level legalizations do not prevent federal enforcement, the Obama administration adopted a practice — though not an official policy — of noninterference with state‐​legal marijuana sales.7 The Trump administration has largely followed the prior practice, but former attorney general Jeff Sessions did rescind an Obama‐​era memorandum requiring federal district attorneys to consider state legality when determining which cases to pursue.8 District attorneys in Colorado and California quickly issued statements stating that the rescission would not affect their prosecutorial practices.9 While President Trump has publicly stated his opposition to cracking down on legal marijuana, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters to expect “greater enforcement” of marijuana laws, and the White House Marijuana Policy Coordination Committee has launched a public relations campaign to undermine state legalization efforts.10



Before the wave of state‐​level marijuana legalizations, the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime estimated that drug smugglers imported two‐​thirds of all marijuana consumed in the United States.11 A 2010 study estimated that Mexican marijuana alone accounted for 40 to 67 percent of all U.S. consumption.12 In 2013, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) found that marijuana smuggling “has occurred at consistently high levels over the past 10 years, primarily across the US‐​Mexico border.”13



Legalized markets directly affect the illegal markets for marijuana. Not only is it easier to obtain domestically produced cannabis today, legal marijuana is also more uniform and of much higher quality than the illegal Mexican product.14 One study for the Colorado Department of Revenue found that a “comparison of inventory tracking data and consumption estimates signals that Colorado’s preexisting illicit marijuana market for residents and visitors has been fully absorbed into the regulated market.”15 Marijuana legally grown in states where it is legalized often supplies consumers in states where marijuana is still outlawed. In 2014, 44 percent of marijuana sales in Denver were to residents of other states.16 The Colorado study found that “legal in‐​state purchases that are consumed out of state” are likely occurring.17 This places further downward pressure on prices and has prompted lawsuits by prohibitionist states against Colorado.18



A prelegalization study estimated that after legalization, it would likely be more expensive to smuggle marijuana from Mexico to every state in the continental United States except Texas than to have it sent from Colorado and Washington.19 This competition appears to be affecting Mexican marijuana prices. Mexican growers have reported that marijuana prices in Mexico have recently fallen between 50 and 70 percent after U.S. legalizations.20 According to the DEA, _overall_ domestic American production has grown because of the new state‐​approved marijuana markets.21 Customs and Border Protection (CBP) itself has hypothesized that one explanation for the decline could be that “legalization in the United States [h]as reduced demand” for Mexican marijuana.22 The fact that some cartels have taken to using drug tunnels to smuggle migrants — who are less profitable and more readily identifiable — is further evidence of the effects of legalization.23



Drug interdiction has a long history in the United States, dating back to alcohol prohibition. During the 1920s, the interdiction of bootleggers served as a principal justification for the creation of the Border Patrol. Labeling them “unscrupulous” and their traffic “nefarious,” government reports repeatedly called on Congress for more agents, money, and aircraft to interdict alcohol.24 From 1926 to 1934, agents intercepted nearly 2 million quarts of liquor.25 Nonetheless, only the end of Prohibition brought about the collapse of the bootleg trade, which dropped 90 percent from 1930 to 1934 and finally disappeared entirely in 1935.



After alcohol prohibition, smuggling of other prohibited drugs has taken over as justification for increasing Border Patrol spending. Since 1951, the Border Patrol’s annual reports have highlighted its contributions to the “drive against narcotics,” particularly its seizures of Mexican marijuana.26 While Mexico has also prohibited the cultivation of the plant since the 1920s, the relative lack of enforcement, the good growing climate, and the differences in economic development between that country and the United States have led Mexico to become the main supplier for its northern neighbor.27 But in 1937, Congress effectively banned the sale of marijuana.28



Today, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has the primary responsibility for interdicting drug traffickers entering the United States. DHS divides its efforts between four agencies: the Coast Guard, which patrols the coasts of the United States; the Office of Field Operations (OFO), which inspects travelers entering legally through ports of entry; Border Patrol, which surveils the northern and southern borders; and Air and Marine Operations (AMO), which supports Border Patrol’s efforts between ports of entry with aircraft and marine vessels. OFO, Border Patrol, and AMO are all divisions of Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Together, these four agencies dedicate $4.2 billion annually specifically to drug interdiction.29



Since 1965, Congress has invested $64 billion to secure the border from illegal immigration as well as drug smuggling.30 Some 82 percent of the spending has occurred in the last two decades alone. Border Patrol has a force of nearly 20,000 agents, a fivefold increase over the level in 1992.31 AMO has an expansive fleet of 286 vessels, 246 aircraft, and 9 unmanned aerial drones designed to spot and interdict traffickers.32 Since 2000, Border Patrol has constructed nearly 600 miles of border fencing and barriers.33



In addition, CBP has nearly 1,500 canine teams used to detect drugs.34 The agency has deployed an extensive system of surveillance equipment between ports of entry, including drones and towers, and adopted new scanners and other technology at ports of entry.35 Despite these purchases, the DHS inspector general concluded in 2016 that the department “could not ensure its drug interdiction efforts met required national drug control outcomes nor accurately assess the impact of the approximately $4.2 billion it spends annually on drug control activities.”36 Similarly, none of its spending had any noticeable effect on the amount of drug smuggling prior to the legalization of marijuana in several states in 2014.



The White House has proposed several additional measures to deter drug smuggling along the border. These measures include a southwestern border wall with Mexico, which carries an estimated price tag of at least $22 billion to construct.37 In addition, the administration has requested that Congress fund the hiring of an additional 5,000 Border Patrol agents to patrol the southwest border.38 President Trump and the White House have repeatedly connected these efforts to build a border wall with drug smuggling, in particular, the smuggling of opioids like fentanyl and heroin.39



Because illicit marijuana moves in the black market, no consistent and reliable data exist on the quantities that smugglers bring into the United States each year. The best available proxy for estimating _changes_ in the flow is the amount that the government seizes at the border. This measure does not provide a reliable predictor of the absolute amount being smuggled, but it can capture trends in the flow. Although the total amount that makes it into the country is likely many times greater than the amount that the government seizes, a relationship will exist between seizures and inflows that allows an approximation of the trends up or down in total flows. In the absence of any other changes that significantly improve or hamper the effectiveness of smuggling or enforcement, more drug smuggling will generally result in greater seizures.



The main possibility that could make seizures a poor proxy for relative flows between years is if the effectiveness of enforcement or smuggling is wildly inconsistent, resulting in a wide variance in the amounts of drugs that agents discover. For example, if most drugs seized at the border came from only a few seizures, or most drugs smuggled came from only a few attempts, the amounts could fluctuate so widely that they would be worthless in assessing changes in the level of smuggling over time.



But because the marijuana seized crossing the border is spread out over many seizures — more than 12,000 annually — chance is less of a factor in these overall trends.40 Moreover, as seen in Figure 2 in the following section, the amount each agent seized was quite consistent before 2014 at an average of 115 pounds per year. Prior to legalization, the average year‐​over‐​year change from 2003 to 2013 was almost zero, compared to 25 percent declines from 2014 to 2018 — greater than one standard deviation downward from the prelegalization trend each year.41 Other data stretching back to the early 1990s support the conclusion that each agent has consistently seized a similar amount.42 Variation in the effectiveness of enforcement or smuggling cannot explain the sudden and persistent decline in seizures over the last five years.



Another issue is that increased enforcement would likely lead to more seizures. It is possible, however, to control for the level of enforcement by focusing on the quantity seized _per agent_ , rather than the aggregate amount for the entire agency (Figure 2). One difficulty with the per‐​agent measurement is that the effectiveness of agents could decrease with each new hire, so the result could measure just the declining utility of the marginal hire rather than a real decline in smuggling. When the agency doubled its labor force from 2003 to 2011, however, the rate of seizures per agent remained flat, while the agency slightly reduced the number of agents during the period of declining seizures from 2014 to 2018. These facts suggest that the decline in seizures per agent is not an effect of diminishing returns from increasing the size of the force.43



In the immigration context, researchers often use the number of apprehensions of border crossers per agent to estimate year‐​to‐​year trends in total inflows of illegal crossers of the southwest border.44 The validity of this measure has recently received support from a 2017 DHS report that used survey data to estimate the number of total _successful_ crossings for the 17‐​year period from 2000 to 2016.45 Comparing these estimates to the per‐​agent apprehension figures during this time indicates that 86 percent of the variance in successful entries can be predicted by the number of apprehensions per agent, making apprehensions a very strong predictor of the year‐​to‐​year trends in successful illegal crossings. Given the similarities between illegal entry of people and the illegal entry of drugs, the same is likely true for drug seizures and smuggling.



Seizures also fail to capture policy changes that could direct agents to prioritize or deprioritize marijuana smuggling, though it is not clear how Border Patrol could, as a technical matter, target a specific illicit drug without also seizing other drugs in the process. In any case, formal policy on marijuana smuggling has not changed during the relevant period, and there has been no apparent change in informal policy priorities. Moreover, the decline in marijuana seizures has occurred across multiple agencies and administrations. These factors make informal policy priorities an unlikely explanation for the trends.



State‐​level marijuana legalization has undercut demand for illegal Mexican marijuana, which in turn has decreased the amount of drug smuggling into the United States across the southwest border. Because it is so much more difficult to conceal than other drugs, marijuana prior to legalization was, according to the DEA, “predominately smuggled between, instead of through, the ports of entry.”46 For this reason, the most important agency for marijuana interdiction is the Border Patrol, which patrols the areas between ports of entry.



Figure 2 reports the number of pounds of marijuana seized annually per Border Patrol agent and compares these figures to the total length of the border fences in a year. From FY 2003 to FY 2009, Border Patrol doubled its workforce and constructed hundreds of miles of fences, yet this increased enforcement did not reduce marijuana smuggling.47 Each agent annually seized virtually the same quantity of marijuana through 2013, indicating roughly the same overall inflow of the illegal substance.48 From 2013 to 2018, however, the amount of marijuana each Border Patrol agent seized declined by 78 percent.

Even within FY 2018, the first three months of the fiscal year — before California legalized sales in January — were 29 percent above the next eight months.49 Marijuana smuggling has also not shifted toward entering through ports of entry. The total quantity of marijuana seized by the OFO, the agency that handles admissions at ports of entry, has dropped by 34 percent from 2013 to 2018 (Table 1).50 Seizures have decreased over water and airborne smuggling routes. While numbers for FY 2018 are not available yet, Air and Marine Operations interdicted 42 percent fewer pounds of marijuana in 2017 than in 2013.51 Likewise, the Coast Guard has seen a 65 percent decline in marijuana seizures during that period.52 Overall, all DHS agencies seized 56 percent less marijuana in 2017 than 2013.

Full legalization of marijuana in several states dramatically increased the amount of marijuana sales that occur legally in the United States. A relatively small amount of legal marijuana sales had occurred prior to 2014 under the auspices of legal medicinal use, and in 2013 and 2014, four states — Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Illinois, and Maryland — legalized medical marijuana. But these states account for just 4 percent of medical marijuana users nationwide, so it is unlikely that they changed the trends substantially.53 Full legalization increased the amount of legal sales from about $1.5 billion to $9.7 billion from 2013 to 2017.54 This increase coincided with a 66 percent drop in the street value of all DHS marijuana seizures — a decline from $2.3 billion in 2013 to $765 million in 2017 (Figure 3).55

The street values of a pound of marijuana estimated by CBP also highlight the increased availability of domestic marijuana. From 2012 to 2017, the average street value of a pound of marijuana seized by CBP declined by 40 percent, dropping from $794 per pound in 2012 to just $474 per pound in 2017.56 Legal marijuana is competing with the drug cartels and lowering prices, which undercuts the financial incentive to smuggle across the border.



Mexican drug cartels have responded to their declining share of the marijuana market by smuggling other drugs through ports of entry but have failed to make up for the decline in marijuana smuggling. Most drugs other than marijuana are smuggled through ports of entry because traffickers can more easily conceal them. For this reason, Figure 4 presents seizures both between and at ports of entry.57 In FY 2013, marijuana accounted for 98 percent of all border and customs drug seizures — both between and at ports of entry — by weight. By FY 2018, that percentage had declined to 84 percent.58 While non‐​marijuana drug seizures have increased — indicating that cartels may attempt to compensate by switching drug type — the decline in marijuana seizures has resulted in a 68 percent overall decline in pounds seized per agent of all drugs since FY 2013.

Marijuana may still dominate by weight, but other drugs — methamphetamine (meth), heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl — are much more valuable per pound. Estimating the value of drug seizures is difficult because drug prices vary widely throughout the United States and no government agency consistently estimates a national average. Moreover, CBP does not report the purity of the drugs it seizes, making it impossible to use outside estimates to value its seizures. However, while the agency does not report the collective value of all the drugs it seizes, it does regularly issue press releases that value individual seizures based on “the latest DEA statistics.”59 Aggregating this information provides the best estimate of how the agency values drug seizures.60



CBP reports the “street value” of a drug.61 Street prices inflate the _absolute_ values of drug seizures because drugs obtain those values only after crossing the U.S. border and arriving at their destinations.62 However, the _relative_ values between the different drugs and between different years are still useful for the purpose of comparison.63 The tables in the Appendix contain the valuations, seizure amounts, and number of agents and officers at ports of entry and between ports of entry.



Figure 5 presents the street value of drug seizures made by both Border Patrol agents between ports of entry and by CBP officers at ports of entry, again showing the average amount seized per agent. By value, marijuana has fallen from about 57 percent of seizures to just 18 percent from FY 2013 to FY 2018. The absolute value of marijuana seizures at and between ports of entry has declined 79 percent from $1.8 billion in FY 2013 to be on pace for just $380 million in FY 2018. Overall, the total value of all drug seizures per agent (or officer) has declined by 34 percent from FY 2013 to FY 2018. Marijuana legalization appears to have cut _overall_ drug smuggling.

All the decline in the value of drug seizures occurred _between_ ports of entry. The value of all drug seizures between ports of entry fell by 70 percent on a per‐​agent basis from FY 2013 to FY 2018, while those at ports of entry increased by just 3 percent (Figure 6). In 2018, the drugs seized by OFO officers at ports of entry were three times more valuable than those seized by Border Patrol between ports of entry, while Border Patrol agents seized more valuable drugs in 2013. In 2018, the average inspector at a port of entry seized drugs valued at almost $71,000 compared to about $23,000 for Border Patrol agents between ports of entry. This fact significantly undermines the argument for more Border Patrol agents or a wall to interdict drug smuggling _between_ ports of entry.

Given the focus of the political debate, it is important to note that drugs other than marijuana are almost entirely seized at ports of entry (Table 2). By value, CBP seized 87 percent of all hard drugs at ports of entry, not between ports of entry, in 2018. Stated another way, the hard drugs seized at ports of entry were seven times more valuable than those seized between ports of entry.

This fact becomes even more pronounced when considering that about half of all Border Patrol seizures of hard drugs in 2018 came at checkpoints in the interior of the United States.64 Drugs seized at checkpoints are already moving within the United States, primarily on major highways, where a border wall could do nothing. About two‐​thirds of Border Patrol seizures of heroin and meth and one‐​third of its seizures of fentanyl and cocaine came at checkpoints from April to August 2018 — the only months that the agency has published data on checkpoint seizures. Separating out these seizures reveals that hard drugs seized at ports of entry were 11 times more valuable than those seized between ports of entry or those seized at interior checkpoints from April to August 2018 — just 7 percent of the value of the non‐​marijuana seizures by OFO and Border Patrol occurred between ports of entry (Figure 7).



 **Figure 7: Percentage of total value of non‐​marijuana drug seizures by location, April to August 2018**

During this time, each OFO officer seized at ports of entry slightly more pounds of marijuana, while confiscating 8 times more pounds of cocaine, 17 times more of fentanyl, 23 times more of methamphetamine, and 36 times more of heroin than each Border Patrol agent seized at the physical border — that is, at noncheckpoint locations between ports of entry (Table 3).65 In light of these facts, a surge of agents, technology, and infrastructure between ports of entry does not make sense as a strategy to control the flow of hard drugs into the United States.66



 **Table 3: Drug seizures by location of seizure (pounds per agent), April to August 2018**

Since the imposition of strict numerical limits on legal immigration in the 1920s, federal efforts to prevent illegal immigration have been largely unsuccessful in limiting the illegal entry and residence of large numbers of immigrants, except when combined with large increases in lawful migration or a collapse in American demand for foreign workers, such as during the Great Depression. Today, Congress spends more money on the agencies responsible for federal enforcement of immigration laws than on all other federal law enforcement agencies combined — about $187 billion from 1986 to 2013.67 Since 2003, the federal government has deported about 1.7 million immigrants from the interior of the country and apprehended another 10 million at the borders.68



Just as legalization of marijuana has helped secure the border against illicit entry of marijuana, making it easier for immigrant workers to live and work legally in the United States has reduced the incentive of would‐​be illegal immigrants to cross the border. Over the last 70 years, the number of work visas is negatively correlated with illegal entries along the border.69 In other words, more work visas mean fewer illegal entries. The best available indicator of illegal entries is the number of apprehended border crossers. All else being equal, the more people who attempt to cross, the more people who are apprehended. Of course, increases in the number of agents could result in more apprehensions — just as more agents lead to more drug seizures — but as in the drug context, it is possible to control for the effect of increased enforcement by focusing on the number of apprehensions that the average agent makes.



Figure 8 presents the number of entries by lesser‐​skilled guest workers from 1949 to 2018 compared to the number of apprehensions per Border Patrol agent.70 The number of apprehensions spiked in the 1950s, but Congress responded by ramping up the number of admissions under the Bracero guest worker program, and illegal immigration almost disappeared. Unfortunately, Congress terminated the program in 1965, and the number of apprehensions per agent rose to a high of 528 in 1986. Starting in the mid‐​1990s, more guest workers began to enter under the H-2A and H-2B temporary worker programs, shooting up dramatically in the mid‐​2000s, while the number of apprehensions per agent collapsed.



 **Figure 8: Lesser‐​skilled guest worker admissions and apprehensions per Border Patrol agent***  
  




*“Lesser‐​skilled” refers to Bracero admissions and H-2A and H-2B admissions; 2018 admissions estimated based on 2017.

Since 1949, apprehensions per Border Patrol agent were two‐​thirds lower in years with greater than 200,000 lesser‐​skilled guest worker admissions when compared with years with less than 200,000 admissions. During the same period, a 10 percent increase in guest workers was associated with an 8.8 percent decrease in apprehensions per agent. In recent years, the number of guest worker admissions increased twentyfold, from 26,014 in 1986 to 536,634 in 2017, while the average agent in 2017 apprehended 97 percent fewer people than in 1986.



Congress is already reducing illegal immigration by issuing more temporary work visas, thus reducing the incentive to cross illegally. Nonetheless, roughly 190,000 people still made it across the border illegally in 2015.71 Congress could address this flow by repealing visa regulations that limit lesser‐​skilled workers to seasonal jobs and exclude them from year‐​round or permanent positions. In addition, the government issues only 5,000 permanent residency visas for employment in lesser‐​skilled occupations. Lifting this quota and creating a work visa for year‐​round positions would help secure the border.



Today, in addition to people entering mainly for the purpose of employment, the Border Patrol also stops many asylum seekers who have left their home countries, primarily in Central America, as a result of political instability and the world’s highest rates of homicide.72 Among these, there are also large numbers of individuals apprehended by Border Patrol who are trying to reunite with their families in the United States.73 While marijuana flows lack these noneconomic drivers, wage differences are still the best predictor of where asylum seekers ultimately end up.74 This helps explain the consistency in the pattern of low levels of apprehensions during periods of high work‐​visa issuances.



Of course, the United States is already home to more than 11 million illegal immigrants, most of whom entered before the increase in guest worker admissions in the mid‐​2000s.75 These workers have built their lives here, and while most probably would have availed themselves of a more permissive temporary worker program had it existed, a temporary worker program is no longer likely to result in a mass exodus. Rather, the United States should do with illegal immigrants what many states have done with illegal marijuana: legalize them — that is, provide an opportunity for them to obtain permanent residency.



Current law not only offers just 5,000 green cards to lower‐​skilled workers but also bans anyone who crossed the border illegally from applying for a green card, including family‐​sponsored ones.76 This prevents many illegal immigrants married to U.S. citizens, who would normally be entitled to permanent residency, from legalizing. Even if they return to their home countries, current law requires them to wait a decade before applying to be reunited with their American spouses — an unrealistic option. The only viable solution is a legalization program that allows them to get right with the law. Paired with more work visas, such a program could dramatically reduce illegal residence and allow for a regulated legal form of entry and residence.



In 1924, when Congress slashed legal immigration by roughly 80 percent, the Border Patrol immediately made the connection between the effects of alcohol prohibition and the effects of the legal immigration restrictions, labeling illegal immigration “bootlegging in aliens.”77 In 1926, the commissioner of the Bureau of Immigration wrote to the secretary of labor that “as a consequence of more recent numerical limitation of immigration, the bootlegging of aliens … has grown to be an industry second in importance only to the bootlegging of liquor.”78 In other words, the government immediately recognized itself as the cause of both illegal immigration and alcohol smuggling. Alcohol legalization eliminated one of the trades, but the other has still not subsided. Marijuana legalization provides yet another model for how to address the illicit cross‐​border flow.



State‐​level marijuana legalization has significantly undercut marijuana smuggling. Based on Border Patrol seizures, smuggling has fallen 78 percent over just a five‐​year period. Because marijuana was the primary drug smuggled between ports of entry, where Border Patrol surveils, the value of the agency’s seizures overall — on a per‐​agent basis — has declined 70 percent. Now, smugglers seek to bring the most valuable drugs into the country through ports of entry rather than smuggling through the deserts of Arizona and New Mexico or across the Rio Grande. The average officer at ports of entry seized drugs valued at three times the amount of the average Border Patrol agent between ports of entry. A border wall or more Border Patrol agents would do nothing to stop most drug trafficking.



Marijuana legalization also provides a model for addressing illegal immigration. The legalization of marijuana eliminated the incentive to smuggle it across the border. In the same way, the legalization of migration and employment by foreign workers in the United States would eliminate the incentive to cross, live, and work illegally. The state‐​level legalization of marijuana has had a major effect on cross‐​border smuggling, implying that even modest reforms to legal immigration could have strong effects on illegal border crossers.

 **Note:** In 2017, CBP valued fentanyl seized at about $29,000 per pound, while valuing heroin about $21,000 per pound.79 CBP describes its valuations as the “street value” of the drugs “based on the latest DEA statistics.”80 According to valuations from the DEA cited in news reports and elsewhere, smugglers can buy heroin in Colombia for about $2,721 per _pure_ pound and sell it wholesale in the United States for about $36,287, while fentanyl can be bought in China for about $2,267 per _pure_ pound and cut into 7 to 11 pounds — each sold for as much as a pound of heroin ($36,287) for a total value of about $725,749 per _pure_ pound.81 Thus, the value of a pure pound of fentanyl is, according to these reports, about 20 times more valuable than heroin, while CBP’s valuations show that their seized fentanyl is only slightly more valuable than heroin. Only CBP knows the purity of the fentanyl that it seizes, and it would be surprising if CBP undervalues its own fentanyl seizures, but if it does — and the actual value of CBP’s fentanyl seizures is about 20 times more than heroin per pound — the total value of drug seizures at ports of entry since 2013 would have increased 50 percent, rather than 8 percent; the total value of drug seizures between ports of entry would have declined 65 percent, rather than 73 percent; and the total value of all drugs both at and between ports of entry would have declined 11 percent, rather than 35 percent. Overall, in this counterfactual, ports of entry would account for 79 percent of the value of all drug seizures rather than 78 percent. Thus, the general conclusions in this paper — that ports of entry are now the dominant means of entry for drugs and that marijuana legalization reduced the overall value of drug flows — still hold, even if CBP is massively undervaluing its fentanyl seizures.

42 The old Immigration and Naturalization Service statistics failed to break down the figures between Border Patrol and immigration inspectors at ports of entry, but because marijuana is smuggled overwhelmingly between ports of entry, we can infer that the overall pattern was the same in the 1990s.

43 On the flip side, a decline in agent effectiveness during the ramp‐​up in agents from 2004 to 2009, to the extent that there was such a decline, would have disguised an increase in smuggling during that time.

45 DHS used survey data on the share of apprehended border crossers who return to their home country without making a new entry attempt to focus on the population that would attempt to enter again. It then subtracted the number who were apprehended while making their repeat entry from the estimate of those who would make a repeat attempt. The success rate thus determined for formerly apprehended immigrants enabled DHS to estimate the number of successful entries for all border crossers.

"More than 20 years ago, the university department where I was doing my PhD was fire bombed by animal rights activists. At the time, I was conducting research into animal welfare, as were many of the staff in my department. I found it hard to understand why a research department whose main objective was to improve the well-being of animals would be the target for such an attack. I suspect most people, as I did then, see animal welfare and animal rights as synonyms. In reality, however, they are at opposite ends of the continuum concerning our treatment of animals. Proponents of animal welfare are interested in questions like: “How can we improve the well-being of zoo animals?” Whereas animal rights supporters ask questions like: “Should we have zoos?”  These are very different questions with diametrically opposed outcomes: the constant improvement of zoos or their closing down. Both could be argued to improve animal well-being, but one is highly pragmatic, whereas the other is philosophical. Accepting and working with the status quo that animals are used for important research or housed in zoos for conservation purposes, my job as an animal welfare scientist is to maximise their well-being in these situations. Much of my work is based on the ideas of the utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham who famously said of animals and their well-being: The question is not: ‘Can they reason?’ Nor: ‘Can they talk?’ But: ‘Can they suffer?’ Bentham, importantly, put the focus on the practical question of suffering, moving the debate away from human-animal comparisons, and brought in the concept of a cost-benefit analysis.  Human activities affect the well-being of animals to different degrees and society uses Bentham’s cost-benefit analysis to determine whether what we are doing is acceptable. For example, treatments for diabetes were developed on animals in laboratories. These, animals paid the cost with theirs lives and, consequently, hundreds of millions of people, presently, benefit from a treatment for a terrible disease. This cost-benefit analysis is enshrined in many laws relating to animal welfare. The role of animal welfare scientists is, on a practical level, to improve animal well-being. On a philosophical level, it accepts some of the ways that human activity impinges on the well-being of animals and works to minimise their cost and maximise the benefits to them.  From this perspective, it can be argued that animal welfare research justifies the continued use of animals by humans, be it for research, for food or in zoos. The support for the continued use of animals for scientific purposes is a particular cause of conflict with animal rights activists – hence why my university department was fire bombed. I believe we should do our utmost to improve constantly the conditions of animals affected by human activities. Like animal rights advocates, my concern is to improve the lot of animals. But, while their approach is to abolish the use of animals, my approach is to work with animal industries. We take a pragmatic stance that it is impossible for modern society to function without using animals – be it for food or for medical research. Most people I suspect have sympathy for the welfare and rights approach, depending on the issue at hand. I, for example, would not support research to improve the wellbeing of whales being hunted for scientific or other purposes. There is, in my opinion, no humane way to kill whales and I disagree with exploiting highly sentient animals when the capacity to suffer seems to be linked to cognitive abilities. But I have to admit when the use of animals affects my life directly then I am more likely to support an animal welfare approach. In the past few years, several members of my family have had life-threatening conditions and all have survived due to medical care based on research using animals. Therefore my interest in this subject derives from what John Stuart Mills called “enlightened self-interest” – that is, we have a moral obligation to take care of the animals who improve our well-being. Just like voting for a political party, before you pin your flag to one cause or another be sure you understand the implication of your choice and that you are prepared to live with it. This might be animals being held in imperfect conditions, but conditions that are improving, or a world without zoos and limited medical advances."
"The glory of the world’s oceans could be restored within a generation, according to a major new scientific review. It reports rebounding sea life, from humpback whales off Australia to elephant seals in the US and green turtles in Japan. Through rampant overfishing, pollution and coastal destruction, humanity has inflicted severe damage on the oceans and its inhabitants for centuries. But conservation successes, while still isolated, demonstrate the remarkable resilience of the seas. The scientists say there is now the knowledge to create an ocean renaissance for wildlife by 2050 and with it bolster the services that the world’s people rely on, from food to coastal protection to climate stability. The measures needed, including protecting large swathes of ocean, sustainable fishing and pollution controls, would cost billions of dollars a year, the scientists say, but would bring benefits 10 times as high. However, the escalating climate crisis must also be tackled to protect the oceans from acidification, loss of oxygen and the devastation of coral reefs. The good news, the scientists say, is a growing awareness of the ability of oceans and coastal habitats such as mangroves and salt marshes to rapidly soak up carbon dioxide and bolster shorelines against rising sea levels. “We have a narrow window of opportunity to deliver a healthy ocean to our grandchildren, and we have the knowledge and tools to do so,” said Prof Carlos Duarte, of King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia, who led the review. “Failing to embrace this challenge, and in so doing condemning our grandchildren to a broken ocean unable to support good livelihoods is not an option.” Prof Callum Roberts, at the University of York, one of the review’s international team, said: “Overfishing and climate change are tightening their grip, but there is hope in the science of restoration. “One of the overarching messages of the review is, if you stop killing sea life and protect it, then it does come back. We can turn the oceans around and we know it makes sense economically, for human wellbeing and, of course, for the environment.” The review, published in the journal Nature, found that global fishing is slowly becoming more sustainable and the destruction of habitats such as seagrass meadows and mangroves is almost at a halt. In places from Tampa Bay, Florida to the Philippines, the habitats are being restored. Among the success stories are humpback whales that migrate from Antarctica to eastern Australia, whose populations have surged from a few hundred animals in 1968, before whaling was banned, to more than 40,000 today. Sea otters in western Canada have risen from just dozens in 1980 to thousands now. In the Baltic Sea, both grey seal and cormorant populations are soaring. “We’re beginning to appreciate the value of what we’re losing and not just in terms of intrinsic beauty of the wildlife but in terms of protecting our livelihoods and societies from bad things happening, whether that be poor water quality in rivers and oceans or sea level rise beating on the doorstep of coastal areas,” said Roberts. However, progress is far from straightforward. Pollution from farms and plastics still pours into the oceans, the waters are reaching record high temperatures, and destructive fishing is still taking place in many places, with at least one-third of fish stocks overexploited. “The Mediterranean is still pretty much a basket case,” said Roberts. “And there is horrendous overfishing throughout large parts of south-east Asia and India, where fisheries are just catching anything they trawl on the seabed to render into fish meal and oil.” The global heating of the oceans has driven the few hundred surviving northern right whales along the coast of the western Atlantic. Here, amid busy shipping lanes and lobster fisheries, they are killed by collisions or drowned in a tangle of ropes, according to Roberts, though new regulations are starting to help. The Gulf of Mexico suffers massive dead zones owing to huge amounts of manure and fertiliser running off midwest farms, and elsewhere albatrosses continue to be snared by long-line fishers, despite simple solutions being available. But examples of the benefits of restorative habits were growing, Roberts said, from the return of once abundant oyster beds that can clean huge volumes of water, to marine protected areas that can boost fishery catches nearby, such as by the Scottish island of Arran. “When I started working on the science of marine protected areas in the early 1990s. it was very much a niche interest,” said Roberts. “Now it’s being discussed at the top level internationally and we have many countries signing up to expand protection to 30% of the world’s oceans by 2030, with the UK among the early adopters of the target.” Marine protected areas have risen from 0.9% of the ocean in 2000 to 7.4% now, though not all are fully implemented. The scientists’s review concludes that restoring the oceans by 2050 is a grand challenge that, with a global redoubling of conservation efforts, can be achieved: “Meeting the challenge would be a historic milestone in humanity’s quest to achieve a globally sustainable future.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterProfessor Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber spoke at the Stakeholders Conference on the 2015 Agreement last week.
You can watch him speak from the 2:30 – 37:00 mark. He made a couple of surprising statements.

Schellnhuber starts off by claiming that media reports saying there’s no consensus are false and are only designed to spread confusion.
He claims that there is no dispute about CO2 trapping heat. But that’s just a diversion from the real issue: CO2 sensitivity and feedbacks. Of course CO2 is a greenhouse gas. But the question is: How much warming will a doubling of CO2 lead to? Not much, or a lot? That’s what is being hotly debated. A number of recent peer-reviewed studies and data are showing that the warming indeed will be small.
But to keep the climate catastrophe scenario alive, Schellnhuber in his speech cherry-picks only the literature that supports a massive warming. He ignores all the other papers that show significantly reduced sensitivity and natural factors.
Concedes warming has stopped, blames the oceans
At the 10-minute mark, Schellnhuber thinks he can use the totally discredited Marcott paper to support the AGW theory! The clueless audience is wowed by it. One has to ask if Schellnhuber is maliciously misleading his audience, or is he totally disconnected from reality and unaware that the Marcott paper is worthless?
At the 11:25 mark, he concedes that warming has paused, calling it “a slowdown“. He says the pause is due to hidden planetary mechanisms that are stealing and hiding the heat. In the presentation he says the warming is there – if you ignore the cooling.
At the 12:30 mark Schellnhuber says that the warming in fact “didn’t really pause, but slowed“. He blames the missing warming on the La Nina’s of the 2000s sucking up the heat. “Something is going on in the ocean. […] We haven’t identified all the mechanisms yet.” The oceans have eaten the “tremendous” heat, he explains.
Actually this may be Schellnhuber finally admitting the role of the oceans for the first time. If he blames the oceans for absorbing heat and cooling the planet for the last 10 years, then he also has to concede that they can also release heat and cause warming – as was the case from the period of 1975 – 2000 when the AMO and PDO indexes rose.
You can’t blame the oceans only when it cools, and CO2 when it warms. Time for Schellnhuber to build oceanic cycles into the models.
Concedes that we may have another decade of slowdown!
Remarkably at the 16:40 mark he concedes:
We may have another decade of warming slowdown.”

Professor Schellnhuber, another 10 years would mean a quarter of a century without warming. Not one single model predicted that. The models that you are now relying on for your catastrophic scenarios are therefore rubbish. You are not going to find a single buyer out there.
In a debate Schellnhuber would not survive the first 10 minutes.
Singles out the Economist
At the about the 17:45 mark, Schellnhuber goes after the Economist for daring to question alarmist science. Notice how he looked down at his notes, revealing he had made it a point to do so.
By the way, there has been a lot of talk…the eminent leading climate scientist who sits on the editorial board at the Economist…that was a joke, you may laugh… ha ha, have actually said that climate sensitivity is smaller than we thought.”
How dare the unqualified Economist question the authoritative scientists?
Finally, at about the 20-minute mark, he begins with all the future catastrophic scenarios that await us. He shows a chart depicting 8°C of warming by the year 2200.
This of course means “the global organs will be pushed to destabilization and collapse“. You see, “tremendous amounts of heat are being processed by the planetary machinery” and will come back (after our lifetimes) with a vengeance.
What a con-job.
Dignity or death…9 billion people are too much
At about the 8:30 mark he shows a graphic depicting the climate over the last 100,000 years, correctly stating that the natural climate is often very unstable and that the last 10,000 years have been a “grace period” for mankind. But eerily he asks the audience:
Can we expect in such a wildly fluctuating climate to support 9 billion lives in dignity? Don’t think so.”
What he means by this is open to interpretation. But let’s recall that he once said the optimum population for the planet is about 1 billion, and that “at 9 billion the planet would explode.”

"At a recent talk on the UK’s energy sector, the head of an electric utility company claimed that “the problem of decarbonising our electricity sector is fixed”. Eyebrows were raised at this, but his point quickly became clear. The technologies needed to decarbonise the UK’s electricity system now exist, he explained. Indeed, grid operators in the UK expect a zero carbon electricity system by 2025. But far greater challenges remain in the heat and transport sectors. Electrifying road transport will likely take longer than 2025 and more electric vehicles could cause the grid’s current electricity demand to double. This is where small island states could help. They provide the perfect proving ground for the multifaceted challenge of transitioning to a transport system that’s 100% powered by electricity. The obstacles are many. Massive infrastructure change is needed, consumer expectations have to be managed, a supportive policy structure must be shaped, and the far reaching impacts of such a transition will need careful consideration.  Our recent paper explains why islands can lead the way towards fully electrified transport. They can help to guide the transition challenges and inform how to scale up for larger, continental transport systems. We focused on the Caribbean and the rapid progress which is already underway on the island of Barbados – now the third highest user of electric vehicles in the world. With excellent solar and wind resources, several Caribbean islands are now pursuing 100% renewable energy transitions. This is a remarkable goal given most are heavily reliant on fossil fuels. As with any country that wants to target 100% renewable energy generation, islands will need to store excess energy for when demand exceeds the supply from wind and solar energy.  Here’s where electric vehicles offer a considerable advantage. Vehicle-to-grid is a relatively new idea that would allow electric vehicle owners to sell electricity back to grid operators while their car is plugged in on their driveway or in parking spaces. This helps the grid meet demand when there is fluctuating electricity generation from intermittent sources such as solar and wind power. If all 132,000 vehicles currently on Barbados were electric, and Vehicle-to-Grid charging were adopted, the cumulative effect of these 132,000 batteries could act as a distributed storage system. That would provide a storage capacity of 0.5 GWh. This would go some of the way towards the 3 GWh that is needed for a 100% renewable energy system on Barbados.  Due to their relative isolation at sea, small islands have always been vulnerable to natural hazards. Acting as mobile storage, electric vehicles have the potential to help with recovery following natural disasters, particularly hurricanes and tsunamis by acting as back-up energy storage for rescue and recovery efforts. As this application becomes better understood, the lessons learned in the Caribbean could become significant for mainland countries, too. One of the main barriers to people buying electric vehicles is driver range anxiety. This stems from typical driving ranges of ~180km on a full battery, longer “refuelling” times compared to conventional cars (30 minutes to ten hours depending on the charger and the vehicle), and too few charging points. Progress is certainly being made in this area - electric vehicle range increased by 56% between 2011 and 2017 – but perhaps too slowly to encourage more drivers to choose electric. On small islands, this barrier largely doesn’t exist. In Barbados, you can drive around the whole country on one charge. In effect, small islands offer an opportunity to fast forward to a time when battery capacities have increased, charging times have decreased, and driver range anxiety is no longer an issue. Like many Caribbean islands, Barbados is particularly reliant on tourism, which contributes over 15% of Caribbean GDP. With over 1.2m visitors each year – more than four times the island’s population – and tourists typically interacting with taxis, public transport, hire cars and coach tours during their stay, islands like Barbados are well-placed to act as country-sized showrooms for an electric transport transition. Caribbean islands have made considerable progress with rolling out electric vehicles, despite scant policy support and financial incentives. However, once a technology has been proven to benefit their economy, small islands tend to have fewer barriers between public ideas and executive decision making. Their relatively flexible governance structures mean they can support rapid adoption of new technology. This was certainly the case in Barbados in the 1970s for water heaters powered by solar energy. A local manufacturer demonstrated their design to the prime minister at the time, highlighting its ability to drastically reduce a household’s monthly gas bill. Convinced, supportive policies were introduced, and the island is now first in the world for solar water heating collector capacity. Electric vehicles are held back in mainland countries due to cost, policy, driver distances and scant charging points, but these barriers are easily negotiated on islands like Barbados. Small islands can lead the way to full decarbonisation of the global transport sector – the rest of the world should take note. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter.

Yesterday I wrote about Hans von Storch’s and Werner Krauss’s new book: “The Climate Trap – the dangerous proximity of politics and climate science”.
There is already some reaction to the book, which is scheduled to be released on February 25…a little over a year since Fritz Vahrenholt and Sebastian Lüning dropped their bombshell “Die kalte Sonne“ (The Cold Sun), which tells us claims of a coming climate catastrophe are unfounded.
The publisher Hanser Verlag writes:
The climate conferences have ended in failure and achieved no consequences, even though emissions continue rising. Climate scientist Hans von Storch and cultural scientist Werner Krauss explain how we ended up in the climate trap – and how we can get out of it. The inflationary announcements of the climate catastrophe led to a loss of credibility in science. Climate change is not a scientific question, but a societal one. It has to be anchored regionally in culture, every-day life, and politics. Global society does not need any politicized science calling for a 2°C target. Instead it needs a science that fathoms the conditions for a pragmatic approach to climate change.”
Reimar Lüst, former president of the Max Planck Society here:
This is an unusual and provocative book. A natural scientist and a cultural scientist have written it together. Hopefully it will annoy both the climate deniers and the climate alarmists within their insular circles.”
If it indeed annoys the alarmists, which I’m sure it will, then very few “deniers” will be annoyed at all by it. We can take criticism.

Gerhard Traufetter of Der Spiegel here:
Hans von Storch is a pioneer in climate modeling and one of the cool-headed voices on the subject. For years he has been dealing with the role of climate scientists, and has sharply criticised that some of them have attempted to drive policy with their research results. Together with cultural scientist Werner Krauss, he is calling for a clear designation of roles: Climate scientists should concentrate on physics and make themselves available to policymakers as ‘honest brokers’.”
Patrick Bahners of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  here:
Hans von Storch doesn’t call for an immediate meteorological state of emergency whenever a snowstorm does not allow itself to be stopped by all the chicanery of environmental law. The realists among the climate scientists are not guaranteeing good weather, but are guaranteeing clear views.”
Again there are lots of indications the book has plenty of harsh criticism aimed at the alarmist scientists who are trying to shape politics. Step by step, voices are speaking out against unfounded climate catastrophism in Germany.
Good news!

You would think that the reporters at _Stuff_ would be familiar with all the Scientific terms related to the environment and climate but you would be wrong.



In [this article,](https://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/climate-news/114450665/earth-overshoot-day-kiwis-consume-a-years-worth-of-resources-in-five-months) the reporter seems to have misheard what was said to them and as a result, gets it completely wrong.



 **“buyer capacity”** should be **[“biocapacity”](https://www.greenfacts.org/glossary/abc/biocapacity.htm)**[ ](https://www.greenfacts.org/glossary/abc/biocapacity.htm) It is- used incorrectly twice.



She also noted that we’re still an “oil-based society”, but our **buyer capacity** has “drastically reduced”.  




“In the early 60s, we were sitting at 18gha… and now we’re at nine.. we’ve halved our **buyer capacity** and that’s what helps us to push those overshoot days to later in the year.”

"Weather is a perennial British obsession, with some of the country’s rainfall and temperature records going back centuries. Some of this data has been invaluable in drawing up detailed pictures of the British climate, which have been influential in computer models used to forecast climate change. But some of it is still effectively unusable because it is marooned in reams of old-fashioned paper records. Now scientists at the University of Reading are planning to rescue these obscure rain gauge records, using citizen scientists to do the work. They hope that hundreds of people currently stuck indoors with little else to do will be inspired to join up to help digitise rainfall data for use by meteorologists and climate experts.  Under the Rainfall Rescue project, volunteers will fill the gaps in British digital weather records between the 1820s and the 1950s by transcribing observations from scans of the old paper records. “We are set to reach in time to rescue millions of pieces of UK rainfall data that are currently going to waste in filing cabinets,” said Ed Hawkins, a professor of climate science at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science and the University of Reading. “These records will help scientists better understand how and why rainfall varies so much in different locations across the UK. With much of the population facing long spells indoors due to Covid-19, the chance to be part of a serious science project may provide a welcome distraction.” Thanks to Britain’s weather obsession, there are records from several thousand rainfall gauges sited across the country from the 1950s alone, but only a few hundred have been digitised so far. The UK’s variable climate, which scientists recently suggested was responsible for disguising some of the impacts of the climate crisis while the impacts in other parts of the world are growing more obvious, makes it crucial to understand why some parts of the UK are wetter or drier than others and to discern long-term trends. For instance, extreme years – a year-long drought in 1921 and the notoriously wet summer of 1912 – can tell scientists a lot, and their understanding will be vastly improved if the weather sources from those years can be viewed at last. Water companies and government planners will also benefit, as the resilience of current systems can be compared with real historical conditions. This is the biggest such project yet, and Hawkins hopes to amass as near complete a record as possible from the 1820s to the 1960s, when digitised records began. There have been three previous weather rescue projects, in which volunteers transcribed measurements from a weather station on top of Ben Nevis and early Victorian records."

Guest Post by Willis Eschenbach
I wrote previously about the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol. In that post, I pointed out an underlying irony of the CDM. At the behest of European AGW supporters who would never, ever think of allowing the building of a hydroelectric dam in their own country, European money is being sent to China where it is used to build … hydroelectric dams.
Of course, it being part of the UN, there’s always more to the CDM story. In this case the “more” is provided by Wikileaks, in particular a diplomatic cable that discussed the CDM in India. The fraud revealed in the cable was so egregious, in fact, that even the AGW supporting Scientific American said:
… most of the carbon-offset projects in India fail to meet the CDM requirements set by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.
So most of the projects that were funded, shouldn’t have been funded. OK, it’s a private-sector scam within a UN scam. Insert your preferred expression of surprise here, along with the required quote from Casablanca.
So far, no big shocks, we find that a UN project is corrupt root and branch, be still my beating heart. But it raised a different question in my mind. Which CDM requirements couldn’t the Indian projects meet? I mean, these are Indian businessmen, I’d have said there was no requirement that they couldn’t figure out how to meet (or at a minimum pretend to meet) … so what was the regulation that was laying them low? The leaked cable contains the Kafkaesque answer.

The hurdle that the Indian projects couldn’t get over is something I hadn’t heard of called the “additionality criteria”. This says the project has to be something that is additional, something that wouldn’t otherwise happen without the CDM assistance. The Kyoto Protocol says that projects that would occur without CDM assistance are not “additional”, and so they should not be certified as emission reductions. Or as the leaked cable puts it in delightful bureaucratese:
(Note:  The  project has to prove that it does not use commonly-available  technology and that it is unviable without carbon credit revenue.  End Note.)
Now that the note has ended, stop and consider that for a moment … the project has to use unusual, cutting edge, novel technology, and it has to be a project that would fail without the CDM.
If I set out to make some guidelines for assistance to emission reduction technologies, those seem like the polar opposite of the guidelines I would make.
First, why not allow the use of proven, reliable, available emission reduction technologies along with unusual, cutting edge technologies with no track record? Instead of reducing emissions, aren’t you reducing your chances of success way, way down by only allowing what may not work?
Second, why fund projects that are “unviable”, as the jargon would have it, if you don’t assist them? As a businessman, the idea of specifically selecting a project for funding on the basis that it absolutely won’t work without free money is … well … it would be hilarious if it weren’t so tragic. The regulation requires that you pick incipient losers, ideas guaranteed to go belly-up unless you shower them with largesse … which seems to this boy like a very poor way to pick winners.
Given those requirements, I can now understand why the majority of the Indian projects “fail to meet the CDM requirements set by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.”
It’s because the CDM requirements are set up so that only impending failures can have a hope of success.
Did I mention Kafka? Perhaps I was thinking of Catch-22 …
In any case, this whole idea of offsetting your carbon sins by paying carbon indulgences seems like a killer idea, it puts the Nigerian 419 scams to shame. My plan is to bring this same brilliant concept to the masses by extending the whole theory of carbon offsets and “carbon neutrality” to encompass sexual fidelity.
Here’s the scheme in all of its beauty: if you want to cheat on your wife or husband, you pay me a fee. I split the fee with one of my employees (actually independent contractors, if anyone is looking for work) who promises not to cheat on their wife or husband for the same amount of time that you have paid for. That way, for a small fee (payable by cash, cheque, or credit card) you can rest assured that your extra-marital actions are “fidelity neutral”.
Makes as much sense as the CDM process, and it would likely make more money. Hey, maybe I could even get some free CDM bucks … oh, wait, I’d have to overcome the “additionality criteria” …

"Airlines are lobbying to rewrite the rules of a global agreement designed to tackle aviation emissions, with the coronavirus outbreak expected to make its targets tougher to meet. Campaigners accused airlines of attempting to “dodge their obligations”, but the industry said it was “a matter of survival”, with most international travel currently frozen in the Covid-19 crisis. The International Air Transport Association (Iata) has called on the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) to amend the carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation (Corsia), or risk airlines pulling out. Under the system, airlines have to pay to offset any growth in carbon emissions above a baseline set by the average emissions of 2019 and 2020. The grounding of aircraft during the pandemic means the baseline will be far lower than envisaged, and the carbon targets much more challenging, if Corsia goes ahead without changes. Iata has told ICAO that the baseline “must be adjusted to ensure the sustainable development of international aviation and avoid an inappropriate economic burden on the sector”. It said some nations could pull out of the agreement if the costs were too high. Before the Covid-19 crisis, estimates showed that airlines were likely to have to spend between £4bn and £18bn a year globally on carbon credits by 2035 to satisfy the Corsia rules. A report by the Green Alliance, before the coronavirus lockdown, found that this was not enough to meet the goals set out in the Paris agreement. The ICAO council had signed off on the Corsia plans on 13 March, gaining plaudits from green campaigners for sticking with its pledges on the climate crisis instead of shelving them in the face of the pandemic. However, airlines’ commitment now looks distinctly shaky. The US Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), a long-time mover behind the Corsia scheme, argued that the existing Corsia rules allowed enough flexibility for governments to address the “suppressed activity in 2020, without any need to renegotiate the measure in a drawn-out political discussion”. James Elliott, a Green Alliance policy adviser, said: “Calls to reduce burdens on the [aviation] sector as it recovers are understandable. But the climate emergency also presents an urgent challenge which must be addressed. If the sector cannot find ways to rebuild itself sustainably after the Covid-19 crisis, it will face painful disruption again in the future as its part in the climate emergency has to be addressed. “If Corsia is amended, it must be done in a way which also strengthens its ambition, with targets to limit and reduce actual emissions levels.” Greenpeace UK’s executive director, John Sauven, said: “At the same time as they’re asking for huge government bailouts, airlines are also lobbying furiously to dodge their obligations towards cutting carbon emissions. “Offsetting schemes have always been big polluters’ favourite excuse to carry on polluting while shifting responsibility for their emissions to someone else. The industry’s current proposal would only make the buck-passing easier.” Iata denied that it was backing away from Corsia. Its director general, Alexandre de Juniac, said: “We haven’t given up our environmental goals … After the recovery we will continue to reduce emissions and noise footprints – that hasn’t changed. “This crisis is a matter of survival for the industry … We are asking governments for urgent help. Of course we will comply with our environmental obligations. Before that, we have to survive – or there will be no issue with the environment, the industry will have disappeared.”"

Batten down the hatches, Oilers. Things are going to get ugly. We have the perfect storm descending on us. The global economy has some serious issues, Australia is going into recession and we have a bunch of clowns without a single economics paper between them running the country. The only reason their tax-and-spend approach has not hit the economy hard so far is because they are so incompetent that they have not yet figured out how to get most of their massive spending policies off the ground. Think of Kiwibuild as a good example. It is a disaster. It is also not alone. 



The Government’s greatest fear (well I assume it’s their greatest fear, and if it isn’t it should be) is unfolding before their eyes.  
Business confidence is [now at a decade-long low](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=12245766). Confidence is not new in a measure of this Government, it’s been down since they arrived.  
Initially it was dismissed as business not liking Labour governments. Committees were formed, speeches were made, promises were inferred, time was asked for. It’s amounted to nothing. 



Of course it has amounted to nothing. When a government decides, completely out of the blue, to blindside a major industry for no better reason than the prime minister wants to do some virtue signalling before she heads off to Europe, you are in trouble and it is only a matter of time before things really start to turn septic. That time is now.



The latest statistics out this week show confidence is at a 10-year low.  
Making it worse is the overall figure, and this was the political argument made by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern about Labour governments, the overall figure used to be different to the personal figure.  
In other words you might be a bit negative, but in your personal circumstances you expected to see things generally tick along, if not improve.  
That number has now turned ugly, a net four per cent now expect their own circumstances to go backwards. Manufacturing, as a sector, wants to jump off a cliff. The services sector, as we have seen, is slowing alarmingly. That’s punters not shopping. 



We have just had another fuel price hike, and these increases affect everything. Inflation is still low, house prices are falling and, if you are in business, rising wages and the risk of increased union action represents a serious threat. Interest rates are through the floor and this is not a good thing for an economy. Much as we all hate high rates of inflation, really low inflation can be a sign of a very bad state of affairs. And here we are.



The tax take is up $2.5 billion – but is that because of the economy, or the fact Treasury couldn’t forecast what day it is tomorrow, far less a business return. 



Like turning around an ocean liner, the flow on effects from the good economic management of the previous government are still there, although they must be running out by now. The tax take will start to fall away fairly soon. Then, as unemployment rises, the tax take will plummet… right at the time that the government is looking to introduce new taxes, such as land tax (read my lips…) to pay for the supposed effects of climate change. Yep. Why else did you think that Jacinda wants the government to declare a climate change emergency?



Who voted for these clowns? Oh, that’s right. No one did.



I think we have fundamental issues now that are going to see growth continue to slow. We have 0.6 per cent last quarter. If it drops below that, it’ll eventually flush through to give us annual growth below two per cent, what we have now at barely over two per cent is bad enough.  
If this lot head to election year with decade-low confidence, a slowing economy, a dropping tax take, a surplus all but spent then you watch the National Party prospects, Simon Bridges or no Bridges, spring to life.



  
 **When people start really paying attention and the vote counts, history shows they don’t vote for economic wreckers.**



  
This crowd were always economic wreckers, but they rode the waves of the previous government’s success for a while. That particular juggernaut will have gone off the road by the next election and voters will be able to see the true idiocy and total incompetence of this dreadful government.



I fervently hope that Mike is right. I also fervently hope that National has some small parties to work with in parliament next time around.

I would like to consider myself a handyman. If something needs fixing I’ll give it a go. And then my beloved will engage plan B and call in an expert to rectify the worsening situation. It is accepted that most of us rely on specialists to ensure a task is completed appropriately. If I want a boil lanced on my bum, I would go to a doctor not an electrician, if you get my drift. So when did Milly Adams, a local hairdresser, who was elected to council simply because her surname started with an “A”, become a climatologist? 



If I wanted to know what the weather was like over the next few days I might give Daniel Corbett a ring. If I wanted to know what the weather will be in ten years time, it appears I only need to give Councilor Milly a call. That is how absurd the “climate emergency” declarations have become.



These people who crave notoriety by declaring such nonsense are at the lower end of the food chain when it comes to intellectual endeavour within the communities they serve. The vast majority of said communities wouldn’t have a clue who represents them, let alone trust them to assimilate their constituent’s collective consciousness.



So a message to all councilors: **keep our streets clean, our parks flourishing, our sewers flowing, our roads open, provide water we can drink, ensure rubbish is disposed of, provide public transport that is punctual and frequent, mow our berms, speed up resource consent approvals and the many other housekeeping responsibilities you are charged with.**



We pay you to deliver these services. Be virtuous at your own expense and in your own time, not ours. Now get back to work and do what we are paying you to do. And emotionally grow up. The only things frying are your collective brains.

In spite of all the alarm being forced upon those living near the coast as a result of Local Authorities drawing scary lines on their LIM reports, it seems that doomsday is a little way off yet.



We can postpone the coastal climate emergency for a week or two.



A [diligent researcher](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468013319300567) has pulled the data from the most reliable tide gauges around the world and found 76 that have a data record longer than 100 years and no quality issues. He even found one in Dunedin.



His conclusion: “All the long-term-trend (LTT) tide gauges of the world consistently **show a negligible acceleration** since the time they started recording in the late 1800s/early 1900s” and there is “ **no sign of climate models predicted sharply warming and accelerating sea level rise** “.



An accurate determination of sea level rise acceleration trends requires at least 100 years of data due to the natural (60- to 80-year) oscillations that could bias the results depending on the start and end dates.



There are 88 world tide gauges with a record length of at least 100 years in the psmsl.org data base. Of those, 76 have no data quality issues.



The average rate of rise for these 76 global-scale tide gauges is just **0.337 millimeters per year** (mm/yr), and the acceleration is a “negligible” 0.007 mm/yr².



Thus, the average rate of sea level rise for the world’s best long-term-trend (LTT) tide gauges amounts to about **3½ centimeters per century.** […]



These results once again serve to undermine the model-based claims that the world’s seas are sharply rising and accelerating due to CO2-induced global warming. […]



  
The Dunedin data is 1.325 mm/year rise since 1900 and accelerating at an alarming 0.01775 mm/yr2. A bit above the average but not time to list your beachfront property with the real estate agent just yet.

"The long, black hem of Ibado Mohammed Abdulle’s diya drags in the sand, creating mini tornadoes of dust under her sandals. At a circular fence of waist-high thorny bushes, she knocks on the metal sheet serving as a makeshift door. A woman’s face, partially hidden by a bright green hijab, appears. “Salaam Alaikum,” Abdulle says, “peace be upon you.” Holding up a hand to the armed guards tasked with accompanying the visiting charity staff following her around the displacement camp, she instructs them to stay outside.  “We don’t want to scare her,” she says. Abdulle, 48, was living in the desert town of Oog in northern Somalia in 2016 when drought turned the region to dust, driving thousands of families from their homes. Now she makes daily visits to one of three sprawling displacement camps outside the town to campaign for vulnerable women and girls. Once a climate refugee herself, she knows what their lives are like. “I tell them to gather in groups when they go out,” Abdulle says. “That most of the men are your enemies, so don’t go out alone so you can be safe from the violence and the rape, especially at night-time.” In Somalia, climate change is driving rape, sexual violence and intimate partner violence. Droughts linked to climate change ravage the landscape with increasing frequency, hurting families who depend on farming and herding animals. The spike in regional violence against women and girls takes two forms: domestic violence against women who have become family breadwinners , and sexual violence against women and girls who have migrated to camps near crowded urban centres. Abdulle came from a pastoralist family, displaced by drought and conflict during Somalia’s civil war in the 80s. After a nomadic life with her family, Abdulle was sent to the capital city, Mogadishu, for her education. She returned first to her parents in northern Somalia, and then moved to Oog. “When my family [lived] in the countryside, we had a drought like this one [in 2016],” Abdulle says. “The people were helped. Some were educated, some worked and some of them went abroad. I know something about the droughts. When the droughts come, there can be good change for the people, especially for women.” In 2016, when waves of displaced pastoralist families streamed into Oog, looking for healthcare, food, water and shelter, Abdulle felt compelled to document the crisis and to protect and empower women and girls. She recorded videos to send to the government and the Somali diaspora, requesting support for the overwhelming need. Abdulle’s no-nonsense attitude and unrelenting commitment encouraged the community to approach the local government to request she be put in charge of their welfare. Holding a paid leadership position overseeing men is an usual responsibility for a woman in Somalia’s male-dominated society. “The surprising thing is that the three male heads of the three IDP camps are … happy that Ibado is above them,” said Muna Hussein, a gender officer at Oxfam, who works closely with Abdulle. “They listen to her.” Camp conditions are hazardous for women: there is no lighting at night, and no doors or fences to keep out opportunistic criminals and predators. As drought continued in 2017 and 2018, the population in Oog’s camps boomed. And crimes against women and girls mounted. While updated statistics are hard to come by, at least 25% of Somali women have experienced gender-based violence exacerbated by conflict and displacement due to the climate emergency, World Bank data shows. Much of this violence happens in displaced communities. Research from Oxfam suggests women in Somalia are most at risk when walking to collect water and firewood, using outdoor toilets and sleeping in makeshift huts that lack doors and lighting. The perpetrators come from both inside and outside the camps. The government, fragile and under-resourced, cannot provide protection and services to the nearly 2.6 million Somalis already displaced. Abdulle has sought to help local women and girls protect themselves by organising groups to collect water and firewood. She has also coordinated forums, groups of volunteers who meet to learn how to campaign for their needs and rights. She also acts as a counsellor and friend for women who have been attacked. “If a girl who was raped came to me, I would start by speaking with her,” Abdulle says. “Then, I would take her to the hospital for any treatment. And I would take her to the nearest police station immediately to arrest the perpetrator of this crime.” In the blazing afternoon sun, with strong winds kicking up fierce dust storms, the makeshift tents in the displacement camp look identical: round huts propped up by sticks and covered in a patchwork of faded, old cloth. But Abdulle knows the women living in each one and navigates between the huts with ease. Sukhra Idris, her name changed to protect her privacy, lives alone in this camp with her two children. When Abdulle enters, she greets her with a hug. The lines around her eyes make Idris look older than her 23 years. She was married at 17 to a man from a wealthy family. “I met a boy and fell in love and felt I was ready for marriage,” Idris says, pulling up the bright green hijab as her young child tugs from her head. “I was in a hurry for that because I was very young.” When the 2016 drought hit, the couple’s livestock transportation business was ruined. . According to experts, men unable to provide for their families often become more prone to domestic violence. Idris says her husband began to abuse her, slamming her against a wall, punching and slapping her. “I told him to do his own work because we didn’t have enough to eat and needed to support old people like my mom and dad,” said Idris. “At that time, he was beating me if I asked him to bring milk for his kids.” Idris tried several times to leave, but social stigma pressed her to return. It was only with Abdulle’s support that Idris was able to leave for good. She struggles to survive with her children in the displacement camp and one has died from diarrhoea. After a long day, Abdulle visits Oog’s only hotel to sit beneath the shade of a tree and sip a cup of camel milk tea. With climate change intensifying and droughts increasing in the region, Abdulle knows she alone cannot meet the overwhelming needs of all Somali women and girls. Her greatest hope is that the displaced women she is helping to train and empower will pick up the fight."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Washington Post lashes out at Europe’s failure to impose a continent-wide cap and trade scheme designed to make carbon fuels more expensive, calling European governments “incompetent central planners” and the continent as a whole a “green energy basket-case“.
The Post laments that Europe has blown a big opportunity to become a greener economy.
I can’t think of a single central planning endeavor that ever has been competent. The Post writes:
FOR YEARS, European leaders have flaunted their unwavering commitment to fighting climate change — and chastised the United States for lagging behind. But last week brought yet more confirmation that the continent has become a green-energy basket case.
[…] the market for carbon permits has all but collapsed. […] European governments have proved themselves to be incompetent central planners…

[…] Germany is irrationally shutting its nuclear power plants … and promising that renewables will somehow pick up the slack. Perversely, that approach has led power companies to ramp up coal burning….”
Continue reading here…
The Post also writes that the US “is now burning less coal even as Europe burns more” because of the US’s “practical embrace of natural gas and the continued use of nuclear power.”
Europe, with it’s overzealous campaign and stance against fracking and nuclear power, has maneuvered itself into an impossible energy position. As the Post writes, Europe is showing the world what not to do.

"The way that we live on Earth is causing an unprecedented acceleration in species extinction. Now, more than half a million species “have insufficient habitat for long-term survival” and are likely to go extinct unless their natural environments are restored. But we are already seeing major problems from this intrusion, not least through an increase in human-animal conflict.

      Biodiversity collapse: the wild relatives of livestock and crops are disappearing


 A case in evidence is that of Avni, a “man-eating” Indian tigress who achieved something close to global recognition at the end of 2018. Man-eating leopards, lions and tigers aren’t uncommon in India – several are killed or captured annually. But Avni achieved fame when a designer cologne was used in an attempt to lure her into a trap. Sadly, the bait failed and she was ultimately hunted down and killed. This tragic tale of a tigress gone rogue unleashed a range of debates on the ethics of hunting, the pragmatics of capture, and the elitism of urban conservationists who were furious at her killing. What was somewhat missing from the discussion was the question of what made Avni the tigress into a man-eater in the first place.  The reasons why big cats turn on humans are complex and can be specific to individuals. But they can no longer be explained outside the context of climate change. Biodiversity depletion, habitat loss, extreme weather events, and a greater struggle over natural resources are affecting how animals live across the entire Indian subcontinent, and indeed the world. We should look to the case of Avni not for the peculiar baiting method, but rather for what her life and death tells us about the climate crisis.  Commonsensically, we assume a distinction between “human land” and “animal land”, or spaces that are human-dominated and those that are reserved for animals. There are, of course, landscapes that are more amenable to the habitation of big cats. Leopards are temperamentally comfortable in scrub forests, for example, and tigers were thought to prefer dense forests. But this distinction between spaces is becoming increasingly artificial, especially in densely populated countries like India. We are now finding increasing evidence of tigers and leopards in human dominated landscapes all over India. Avni was, it is widely agreed, not born in a tiger reserve. She was born in what is called a non-tiger zone or, sometimes, human-land. But she was described as venturing onto human land – farms, village outskirts, even the villages themselves – and preying on humans and their livestock. There is an incredulity to such appearances, which are described as the tiger or leopard “straying”, “escaping”, or “intruding”.  But the fact of the matter is that sightings of big cats in urban backyards are no longer aberrations in India, and they are only set to grow. There is increasing evidence of tigers and leopards in human dominated landscapes all over India. As urban areas expand out, afforestation continues apace, and with some minor successes in tiger and leopard conservation, humans will need to be prepared to more openly share land with big cats.  Another thing that Avni’s story makes clear is the role of human policies in exacerbating, if not actually creating, human-animal conflict. There is a very high probability that a controversial ban on slaughtering cattle in the state of Maharashtra, where Avni lived, had a big role to play in the creation of this so-called man-eater.  Perhaps Avni was attracted to villages for the potential prey of defenceless humans, which are becoming more and more attractive in the context of animal extinction and a rapidly depleting prey base. But as several news outlets have noted, what is much more likely is that she was attracted to human settlements to hunt the plentiful cattle available. A direct effect of the beef ban, then, is the horrifying fact that humans have became the prey of a predator in lieu of cows.  It is becoming increasingly difficult for us to deny or look away from the effects of climate change. The climate is changing, bringing with it not just dry river beds or extreme weather events but big cats into cities, too. When leopards walk almost to the gates of New Delhi, or lounge on golf courses in Gurgaon, this isn’t an animal that is merely lost or straying. When a tigress keeps hanging around people and, unfortunately, develops a taste for human flesh, this isn’t just one aberrant big cat. Avni and other big cats are symptomatic of what climate change is doing to our present. Categories and distinctions that we took for granted – such as tiger land versus human land – no longer apply, if they ever really did. Another way to understand the climate breakdown, through the life of Avni and other big cats with similar fates in India, is as an irretrievable collapse of the commonsensical.

There are probably a wide range of reasons to object to Senator Jeff Sessions as President-elect Trump's choice for Attorney-General. I'll leave it to others to explain the concerns with Sessions in that role, but there is an issue with his understanding of trade agreements that I think is worth highlighting. Sessions has been repeating an objection to the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) that completely misunderstands the text of that agreement, and it is worth correcting the record.   
  
The issue relates to the governance of the TPP. Sessions believes there will be a TPP Commission that acts as a supra-national governing entity and can override domestic laws. Here's something he said last year:   




Among the TPP’s endless pages are rules for labor, environment, immigration and every aspect of global commerce – and a new international regulatory structure to promulgate, implement, and enforce these rules. This new structure is known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership Commission – a Pacific Union – which meets, appoints unelected bureaucrats, adopts rules, and changes the agreement after adoption.   
  
The text of the TPP confirms our fears, plainly asserting: ‘The Parties hereby establish a Trans-Pacific Partnership Commission which shall meet at the level of Ministers or senior officials, as mutually determined by the Parties,’ and that ‘the Commission shall’:   






Further, the text explains that ‘the Commission shall take into account’:   






This global governance authority is open-ended: ‘The Commission and any subsidiary body established under this Agreement may establish rules of procedures for the conduct of its work.’ It covers everything from the movement of foreign nationals: ‘No Party shall adopt or maintain…measures that impose limitations on the total number of natural persons that may be employed in a particular service sector. . . in the form of numerical quotas or the requirement of an economic needs test’; to climate regulation: ‘The Parties acknowledge that transition to a low emissions economy requires collective action.’   
  
These 5,554 pages are like the Lilliputians binding down Gulliver. They will enmesh our great country, and economy, in a global commission where bureaucrats from Brunei have the same vote as the United States.   
  
...   
  
At bottom, this is not a mere trade agreement. It bears the hallmarks of a nascent European Union. ... 





In August of this year, he said something similar:    




The TPP permanently alters the landscape. The 5,554-page accord, disguised as a simple trade agreement, commits the American people to an international commission with the power to act around Congress. It allows 12 nations, some with less than 1 percent of the GDP of the United States, an equal vote in the TPP Commission. Actions by this commission separate the American people from the policy decisions that affect their lives. The TPP Commission is a direct threat to representative democracy and accountability. 



The reality is very different. To be clear, there is in fact something called a TPP Commission, established in Chapter 27 of the agreement, which is titled Administrative and Institutional Provisions. Article 27.1 says: ""The Parties hereby establish a Trans-Pacific Partnership Commission (Commission), composed of government representatives of each Party at the level of Ministers or senior officials. Each Party shall be responsible for the composition of its delegation."" And it does have the tasks he mentions, as set out in Article 27.2.   
  
But if you just read down one more provision, to Article 27.3, you can see why this Commission is no threat to anyone's sovereignty or democracy:   




Article 27.3: Decision-Making   
  
1\. The Commission and all subsidiary bodies established under this Agreement shall take all decisions by consensus, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, or as otherwise decided by the Parties.2 Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Commission or any subsidiary body shall be deemed to have taken a decision by consensus if no Party present at any meeting when a decision is taken objects to the proposed decision.   
  
\--------------------   
  
FN. 2 For greater certainty, any such decision on alternative decision-making by the Parties shall itself be taken by consensus.   
  
2\. For the purposes of Article 27.2.2(f) (Functions of the Commission), a decision of the Commission shall be taken by agreement of all Parties. A decision shall be deemed to be reached if a Party which does not indicate agreement when the Commission considers the issue does not object in writing to the interpretation considered by the Commission within five days of that consideration. 



Basically, this provision says that all decisions of the Commission have to be by consensus of _all_ the governments who are parties to the TPP, one of which is the United States. In other words, _no decision can be made unless the U.S. government agrees to it._ And while the provision mentions that the parties can decide to take decisions in a manner other than consensus, note that footnote 2 says that the decision to do so _must itself be taken by consensus_ , so the U.S. would have a veto here as well. (There is also a clause that says ""except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,"" but that applies to a very limited number of situations, such as the special decision-making procedures for accession of new countries to the agreement.)   
  
Furthermore, when it comes to the only provision that envisions the Commission actually modifying the TPP, Article 27.2.2(c), the provision requires both consensus among parties and the “completion of any necessary legal procedures by each Party."" In the United States, this would mean implementation of the relevant TPP modification pursuant to the TPP Implementation Act passed by the U.S. Congress or new congressional legislation. This provision thus underscores the Commission’s—and the TPP’s more broadly—deference to the sovereignty of each TPP party, including the United States.   
  
What this all means is that there will be no ""Pacific Union,"" no ""nascent European Union,"" and no ""unelected bureaucrats"" adopting rules and changing the agreement after it has been concluded.   
  
And just to be clear, this Commission is not some nefarious innovation created by the Obama administration as part of the TPP negotiations. Rather, similar bodies have been part of U.S. free trade agreements for a long time. (Examples from Bush-era trade agreements are here and here.) Practically speaking, based on how the same thing works in other trade agreements, what the Commission means is this: if the TPP comes into force, the governments would meet occassionally and talk about how the agreement is working. They will offer diplomatic statements, express concerns, and have long discussions. Every now and then they will actually have to make a decision. But again, unless all the governments—including the U.S.—agree, no decision will be made.   
  
There may be other reasons Sessions opposes free trade or trade agreements, but we should not let the real debate get thrown off course by misconceptions about how these agreements operate.

"**The Republic of Ireland's cabinet has agreed to reopen all retail outlets, hairdressers, museums and libraries from Tuesday of next week.**
Ireland has been in lockdown for nearly six weeks, with rules similar to those in spring, except schools stayed open and construction continued.
From 1 December, people will also be able to attend religious services and play golf and tennis again.
They will not be allowed to leave their county except for essential reasons.
That would include work, education or a medical appointment.
On Friday next week - 4 December - restaurants and pubs that have a kitchen and serve food will reopen.
However, pubs that do not serve food will remain closed except for delivery or take-away services.
From Friday, 18 December until 6 January people will be allowed to travel to visit family and friends, but only three households can gather.
It is understood the government will revist the issue of travel to Northern Ireland closer to 18 December.
It had been reported that TÃ¡naiste (Irish deputy PM) Leo Varadkar had advised against cross-border travel to Northern Ireland at Christmas.
However, Mr Varadkar clarified on Thursday that there was ""no question of there being an outright travel ban between north and south"".
The three-party coalition government is continuing to advise people to wear masks in crowded outdoor areas during the festive season.
New rules are also expected on the distance between tables in premises and a reduction in the amount of time people can stay there.
It follows a five-hour meeting on Thursday night of the Covid-19 cabinet sub-committee.
Ministers made their decisions despite advice from public health officials that they should choose between either opening restaurants and pubs that serve food and allowing household visits.
It is understood that the cabinet, which had access to its own research, believes its proposals take on board some of those concerns while allowing people to have ""a meaningful Christmas"".
Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin is expected to make a national address during the RTÃ TV evening news."

Predictions of imminent environmental disaster have probably been with us since the first _H. Habilis_ preached that everyone was gonna die if they kept eating all the antelopes. Malthus stepped up the game in the 18th century, but the big worry a hundred years later was horse shit. Big metropolises like London and New York were drowning in a sea of brown muck, much like San Francisco today.



Urgent commissions were tabled, experts were consulted, but the problem seemed intractable. But, by the First World War, the problem just disappeared. What happened? The motor-car.



The internal combustion engine didn’t triumph because governments subsidised car production or taxed horses out of existence. Instead, someone invented a better alternative. Similarly, humans won’t stop burning oil because it runs out, or because governments ban coal. When someone invents a better, cheap, reliable alternative, the carbon problem will solve itself.



Investing in green innovation is the best investment. To see why, think back to the 1960s and 70s when the world worried about mass starvation, epitomised by ­recurrent famines. If we had adopted today’s approach to climate, we’d have asked everyone (especially the rich) just to eat less while we sent small amounts of food from rich countries to poor. It didn’t succeed.



Just as the world failed to drown in horse poo, it likewise failed to starve to death. In fact, the opposite happened, right across the globe.



What did work was the Green Revolution. Through practical innovation — irrigation, fertiliser, pesticides and plant breeding — the Green Revolution increased world grain production by an ­astonishing 250 per cent between 1950 and 1984, raising the calorie intake of the world’s poorest people and reducing the incidence of serious famines.



Instead of tinkering around the edges, innovation tackled the problem head-on. Instead of asking people to do less with less, innovation offered the ability to produce more with less…The best example in climate is the 10-year $US10 billion public investment into shale gas in the US. While it wasn’t intended as ­climate policy, it led the way for a surge in production of cheap gas, which outcompeted a significant part of US coal consumption. Because gas emits about half the CO2 of coal, the US has reduced emissions more than any other country in the past 10 years.



The evidence created by specialist climate economists for Copenhagen Consensus showed that a substantial increase in green R&D could do much more than any carbon-cutting promises.



Lomborg believes that the answer to this is ramping up government investment in R&D. But is it really? The Green Revolution was largely funded by private investment by the likes of the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations. The ridiculously-maligned Monsanto is leading the new wave of innovation in GMOs. Government bureaucracies are notoriously resistant to change and are stacked with careerists who never have to face up to the consequences for their bad decisions.



Investing dramatically more into green energy R&D means we can start looking for lots of solutions…Craig Venter, the biotechnologist and geneticist who led the first draft sequence of the human ­genome, argues for research into an algae, grown on the ocean surface, that produces oil. Because it simply converts sunlight and CO2 to oil, burning it will be CO2-free. It is far from cost-effective now, but researching this and many other solutions is not only cheap but ­offers our best opportunity to find real breakthrough technologies.



If we could make alternative technologies cheaper than fossil fuels, we wouldn’t have to force (or subsidise) anyone to stop burning coal and oil. Everyone would shift to the cheaper and cleaner alternatives.



Government bureaucracies have a woeful track record of backing wrong horses and sinking billions of taxpayer dollars into duds like Solyndra.



Nobody can predict with certainty whether the breakthrough technology will be algae, solar and batteries, fusion or something else altogether. Finding the solution could take a decade or it could take four. But we do know that we ­certainly won’t solve climate change with the current approach of making big promises and investing in inefficiency.



Not to mention throwing billions of taxpayer dollars at the hobby-horses of bureaucrats and loudmouth celebrities.



Those who claim we already have a solution to climate change are right in only one sense: ­humanity has no shortage of ­capacity for innovation. It needs to be unleashed.

When Donald Trump was elected in 2016, the political left wasted no time gibbering about a “return to the 1930s”. In one sense, they were right: for the first time since the 1930s, black-masked paramilitaries are enacting a reign of violent terror in the streets. Even worse, anti-Semitism is on a disturbing rise.



What the left didn’t tell us was that it was **them** leading the charge back into the Dark Valley of the 30s.



What has caused the deeply alarming upsurge in antisemitism across the West? As many have observed, there are three principal sources: the political left, Islamic culture and neo-fascist or white-supremacist cults.



One further factor, though, is crucial.



The left is excusing anti-Semitism where it suits them.



Antisemitism can be kept to a low level by condign social disapproval that deems antisemites to be totally beyond the pale.



If, however, that social stigma is lifted and society tolerates, excuses or sanitizes antisemitism, then it roars out of control.



British lawyer Mark Lewis said, “Jeremy Corbyn moved the rock, and the anti-Semites crawled out from underneath the rock”. Corbyn didn’t **make** Labour anti-Semitic: he just gave the Jew-haters in the party the all-clear.



That’s precisely what is now happening. In America, astoundingly, it is **being facilitated and mainstreamed by Democratic Party grandees.**



Many of the Democrats’ rising stars are **blatantly anti-Semitic**. Keith Ellison, Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar all have an undeniable track record of anti-Semitic comments and associating with vicious anti-Semites. Women’s March organiser Linda Sarsour is another anti-Semite, with documented links to Islamist organisations. **The Democrat party backs them to the hilt.**



Instead of treating [Tlaib] as a pariah to be shunned, the Democrats have circled the wagons around her…It was Pelosi’s defense of her remarks that was outrageous. Worse, this is now part of a pattern by Pelosi of sanitizing and normalizing Islamic antisemitism.



Although Minnesota Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar accused Israel of “hypnotizing the world” and prayed that “Allah awaken the people and help them see [Israel’s] evil doings,” Pelosi appointed her to the House Foreign Affairs Committee. And after Omar claimed that Jews use their money to suborn American politicians in the interests of Israel, Pelosi played down the remark.



 **She also invited a radical Islamist imam, Omar Suleiman, to deliver the noon prayer in Congress.**



The British left is no better.



A major part of the problem is that this derangement is by no means confined to the supporters of Labour’s far-left leader Jeremy Corbyn. This was shown by last weekend’s revolting anti-Israel hate-fest in London. Chanting demonstrators brandished posters declaring that Jews control the media, Jews are the new Nazis, Jews have no right to a state, Jews bring antisemitism upon themselves and so on.



Yet faced with this chilling display, the media could barely bring itself to shrug.



Then, of course, there is NZ’s own [Golriz Ghahraman](https://www.timesofisrael.com/new-zealand-lawmaker-says-jesus-mother-was-palestinian-refugee/), not to mention the outbreaks of leftist anti-Semitism in Australia.



Yet, the left continues to delude itself that it is, by definition, “anti-racist”. So, why is anti-Jewish racism so horrifyingly prevalent on the left? Because their signature cause, their article of faith, is fundamentally anti-Semitic.



Progressive people refuse to acknowledge that their signature Palestinian cause — so revealingly exposed by the mind-bending distortions of Rashida Tlaib — is the new antisemitism.



And that’s because they refuse to acknowledge that **Palestinianism itself is fundamentally anti-Jew.**



The media, themselves overwhelmingly leftist, in fact deliberately lie in order to cover up for leftist anti-Semitism.



A Gazan boy says “the revolutionary songs excite you, they encourage you … to rip a Jew’s head off.” But, instead of accurately translating the Arabic word Yahud that he and others used for Jew, the BBC mistranslated it as “Israeli”…this is simply untrue…Denial of Palestinian and Muslim antisemitism is legitimizing, mainstreaming and fueling antisemitism in the West.



When confronted with their own bigotry, people like Tlaib and Suleiman claim that the real problem of antisemitism comes from “the right.”



And which groups in both America and Britain hand them this particular “get out of jail free” card so they can continue to escalate the climate of Jew-hatred? Why, the left, of course — and the Jews.



  
Like Black Americans, too many Jews have stayed rusted-on to the left, even as the left turns overwhelmingly against them. But, like the Black “Walk Away” movement, a growing sub-stratum of Jewish opinion is finally starting to say, “enough is enough”, in a [“Jexodus”](https://worldisraelnews.com/jexodus-to-exodus-movement-to-wean-jews-from-democratic-party-expanding/).

"**From December 2, three-quarters of people living in the North of England and the Midlands will be facing the toughest restrictions.**
But in the South of England, just 10% of people will face the tier three curbs.
Why is this?
The main data we've got is the number of coronavirus cases picked up through testing.
This shows that, although London initially had the largest spike in cases in early April, northern England has had the highest sustained rates of infection since that point.
Strict restrictions in October, followed by the national lockdown, have helped drive down cases in the North - particularly the North West, but they still remain higher than in the South.
In the week ending 22 November, case rates were:
Looking at these rates doesn't necessarily tell the full story though.
We know that some ""hotspots"" have received mass testing, for example and when you test more people, you are more likely to find cases - which could contribute to a rising rate.
However, other data sources do confirm a gap between the regions.
For example, the proportion of tests that prove positive increased across the country in October, and was highest in northern regions before coming down in recent weeks.
In North East England, about 10% of tests done on the public are coming back positive (double the figure of a month ago), while in the South East and South West, it is under 7%. In London, though, it is around 10%.
And the Office for National Statistics infection survey, which is used to get an estimate of coronavirus in the wider population who might not get a test, shows that samples taken in the North West, North East and Yorkshire are coming back positive at about twice the rate of the South.
The samples also show that London has high rates which are comparable with the north, something not picked up in the same way by the testing system's case rate.
Hospitalisation rates of people with coronavirus for the week ending 22 November again show a regional variation:
Some parts have been facing curbs for a very long time.
In Leicester, for example, it has been against the rules to go to a friend's house for dinner for more than eight months (there was a brief period when you could go to someone's garden).
It has been almost as long in part of Greater Manchester and Lancashire, whilst in most of the south people have faced the same restrictions for four-and-a-half months.
London will go into tier 2 but some parts of the capital rank highly in some of the metrics being used to decide tiers, such as case rates and test positivity.
The government acknowledges that the situation in London is not ""uniform"", but says that ""the situation in London [as a whole] has stabilised at a similar case rate and positivity to other parts of the country in Tier 2.""
We don't have access to the exact information the government is using and there is no public data on hospital capacity (how much space there is for new patients). Pressure on the NHS is one of the key criteria used to decide which area goes in which tier.
However, the data we do have shows that London's overall case rate is closer to the lower levels of the South West and South East than it is to the northern regions, as are its hospital rates (although they decreasing at a slower rate).
But some individual boroughs - including outer London areas - do score highly on these same metrics. High coronavirus prevalence in one or two areas has been used to bring whole counties into tier three - Kent, for example - so why hasn't this happened in London?
The government points to cases rising in all areas of Kent, even if they are currently lower than in some parts of London, and says that hospital admissions might need to be spread across the county. They do not reference this particular concern for hospital capacity in London saying bed occupancy remains below the spring peak.
But without access to all the government data, we can't give a full explanation.
There is no single answer.
First, the increases which happened over the summer and autumn could be linked to the timing of the easing of restrictions in May.
At the time, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, described it as a ""London-centric"" approach, because many of the regions had not yet seen the decrease in deaths and cases experienced in the capital.
Second, there could be factors relating to demographics in northern England which have made people there particularly vulnerable to the virus.
Lesley Jones, Bury's head of public health, told Radio 4's PM programme there was ""more vulnerability within our populations"" with ""higher levels of deprivation, more density, more people in exposed occupations"".
Throughout the crisis, research from Public Health England (PHE) has highlighted that people living in deprived areas ""have higher diagnosis rates and death rates than those living in less-deprived areas"".
Deprivation is linked to serious health conditions and other issues such as overcrowded housing.
Our analysis shows that 63% of people living in the most deprived areas are living in tier three areas; twice the rate of the least deprived areas.
On population density, people in south-western and eastern England are more likely to live in rural areas or small rural towns. This means they are less likely to live in overcrowded housing, reducing the spread between households.
According to the 2011 Census, 35% of southerners (excluding London) lived in these areas, compared with 26% in the Midlands and 19% in the North.
The case of London makes it difficult to simply call it a North-South divide, Richard Harris, a professor in social geography at the University of Bristol, told Reality Check in June.
""It is not a North-South divide but an urban-lower-income v others divide, with those in lower-income jobs more exposed to the disease than those that are more easily able to adapt to home working and other means of isolation,"" he says.
The ability to work from home is also a factor.
According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), ""jobs based in workplaces in London and the South-East are much more likely to be possible to do from home compared with the rest of the UK"".
It says this is probably because of a higher proportion of people working in professional occupations in the region.

_The Current Wisdom_ is a series of monthly posts in which Senior Fellow Patrick J. Michaels reviews interesting items on global warming in the scientific literature that may not have received the media attention that they deserved, or have been misinterpreted in the popular press.   
  
_The Current Wisdom_ only comments on science appearing in the refereed, peer-reviewed literature, or that has been peer-screened prior to presentation at a scientific congress.   
  
**More Good News About Sea Level Rise**   
  
In the last (and first) installment of _The Current Wisdom_ , I looked at how projections of catastrophic sea level rise—some as high as 20 feet this century—are falling by the wayside as more real-world data comes in. In the last month, there’s been even more hot-off-the-press studies that a) continue to beat down the notion of disastrous inundations, and b) received no media attention whatsoever.   
  
Last month, I featured a new analysis which showed that the calibration scheme for satellite gravity measurements was out of whack, leading to an overestimation loss of glacial ice from Greenland and Antarctica by about 50%.   
  
This time around, there are two brand-new studies which further dampen the fears of rapid sea level rise spawned by a warming climate. The one estimates that about 25% of the current sea level rise has _nothing whatsoever to do with “global warming” from any cause_ , but instead is contributed by our increasing removal of fossil groundwater to suit our growing water demands. And the second estimates that the total sea level rise contribution of one of Antarctica’s biggest outlet glaciers—one which has been called “the weak underbelly” of the massive West Antarctic Ice Sheet—is most likely only going to be about 1/2 _inch_ by the year 2100. Neither met the press, which is why you are reading about them here.   
  
Last month we concluded that “things had better get cooking in a hurry if the real world is going to approach these popular estimates [3 to 20 feet of sea level rise by 2100]. And there are no signs that such a move is underway.” Now, there are even more signs that the massive sea level rise candle is flaming out as rapidly as cap-and-trade in an election year.   
  
A team of scientists from the Netherlands, headed by the appropriately surnamed Yoshihide Wada, have been investigating the magnitude and trends of groundwater usage around the world. For millennia, humans “mined” water under the surface, but the volumes were globally inconsequential.   
  
Wada _et al_. found many regions, including the Midwestern and Southwestern U.S., in which groundwater extraction exceeds groundwater replenishment. Around the world, Wada et al. found that the total excess was about 30 cubic miles per year in 1960, which rose to about 68 by the year 2000.   
  
What on earth does this have to do with sea-level rise?   




Remember that, outside of nuclear reactions, matter is never destroyed. Water taken out of the ground either runs off to a creek and makes it back to the ocean, or it evaporates. Because the total water vapor concentration in the atmosphere is constant (depending upon the average temperature of the water/atmosphere interface), the additional evaporation is available for precipitation, adding to that which runs off.   
  
68 cubic miles of added water to the ocean each year amounts to about three-hundredths of an inch of sea level. Granted, this is a small amount, but (despite the scare headlines emanating from our greener friends), the annual rate of global sea level rise during the past 20 years has only been about 0.12 inches per year. So groundwater extraction accounts for about a quarter (.03/.12) of the current rate of sea level rise.   
  
This is a rather large bite out of the apple of sea level rise, and it means that estimates of just how much sea level rise is being caused by ongoing global warming have to be slashed.   
  
In a much-hyped paper appearing in _Science_ magazine back in early 2007, Stefan Rahmstorf and colleagues (including NASA’s infamous Cassandra James Hansen, the Nouriel Roubini of climatology), proclaimed that sea level rise is occurring at a rate which was at the very high end of the projections from the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)—fuelling claims that the IPCC sea level rise projections from climate change were too conservative.   
  
(Hansen is also the lonely champion of the notion that sea level will rise 20 feet in the next 89 years. Twenty years ago, he predicted that New York’s Westside Highway would be inundated by _now_.)[1]   
  
If the Rahmstorf _et al_. analysis were updated through 2010 and the impact from groundwater depletion figured in, it would turn out that the observed rate of sea level rise from global warming would fall at or below the IPCC’s mid-range projection which ultimately results in about 15 _inches_ of sea level rise by 2100. Such a finding of course would ignite very little hype—which is why you are reading it here.   
  
Ah, but you say, don’t the global warming doomsayers tell us that the rate of sea level rise will accelerate rapidly as the climate warms and glaciers atop Greenland and Antarctica slip off into the seas, and so the total rise by the end of the century will be much above a value based on an extrapolation of the present?   
  
The idea—graphically portrayed in Al Gore’s science fiction film—is that summer meltwater will flow down the, say, 10,000 feet required to get to the bottom of Greenland’s ice, and “lubricate” the flowing glaciers. (Of course, the reason glaciers flow to begin with is because the pressure is so great that the bottom water is liquid, but never mind that fact).   
  
Last time, I noted a recent paper by Faezeh Nick and colleagues that basically pooh-poohed the idea that surface meltwater does this.   
  
_Offing the PIG_   
  
Another oft-repeated threat is that there are a plethora of glaciers in Antarctica that are grounded in the oceans, and that higher water temperatures will lead to melting from below that will ultimately “unground” them, floating them and causing rapid retreat.   
  
Alarmist fingers are most often pointed at Antarctica’s Pine Island Glacier (PIG), the leading candidate to unground and raise sea levels by up to 4.5 feet a relatively short amount of time. It was Terence Hughes (from University of Maine’s Climate Change Institute, which—surprise—thrives on climate change) in the early 1980s that labeled the PIG as the “weak underbelly” of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet for, in his view, having the biggest potential to contribute a lot of sea level rise in a short amount of time. Hughes’s belief has become popular of late as the rate of retreat of the PIG increased in the early 1990s.   
  
In 2008, University of Colorado’s Tad Pfeffer and colleagues projected that the PIG (and the nearby Thwaites glacier) would add between 4.3 and 15.4 inches of sea level rise by 2100. In early 2010, the reliably alarmist _New Scientist_ headlined “Major Antarctic Glacier ‘Past its Tipping Point’”, inaccurately quoting Oxford’s Richard Katz who actually said “the take-home message is that we should be concerned about tipping points in West Antarctica and we should do a lot more work to investigate” (translation: can I scare you into sending me more money?).   
  
But throwing cold water in the PIG pen are the prolific polar researcher Ian Joughin and his colleagues. In a new paper published in _Geophysical Research Letters_ , Joughin _et al_. reported their efforts to simulate the future behavior of PIG using a “basinscale glaciological model” that they verified against a large amount of satellite observations documenting the flow rate and thinning rate of the PIG. Once they were happy that their model depicted the observations correctly, they turned to look at what the future may hold in store.   
  
What they found came as a bit of a surprise.   
  
Instead of an accelerating retreat, it seems that the PIG’s still-tiny decline may remain constant. Joughin _et al._ , write:   




PIG’s dramatic retreat and speedup may not indicate a trend of continued acceleration, and speeds may stabilize at their current elevated levels as thinning continues.



This result ties into another investigation of recent PIG behavior that was published this summer. In that one, Jenkins _et al._ concluded that the geometry of the sea floor upon which the PIG rested is what allowed for a rapid retreat when warming first commenced. In other words, the PIG was predisposed to a rapid response— _initially_.   
  
When Joughin _et al_. plug potential future climate change into their glaciological model of PIG, they found that the initial acceleration is not maintained for very long, and instead soon stabilizes. This has large implications. Instead of PIG contributing _many_ inches of sea level this century, they found about a single inch—and that was the worst case. Joughin and colleagues best estimate is something closer to ½ inch.   
  
Joughin _et al._ conclude:   
  
While we have not modeled the other [nearby Antarctic] glaciers, PIG is the most rapidly changing and largest contributor to the current imbalance, indicating future model-derived upper bounds on 21st century sea level for the entire region are likely to fall well below the heuristically derived 11-to-39 cm upper bound [Pfeffer _et al_., 2008].   
  
Hardly catastrophic.   
  
Sooner or later, these facts may penetrate into public consciousness... but until then I hope you’ll continue to consult _The Current Wisdom_.

The World Bank issued a press release on Tuesday announcing the results of a study published March 2, which concludes that 17 of the 20 so-called G-20 countries have invoked at least some protectionist measures since pledging last November to avoid protectionism for at least one year.   
  
Of course the _Washington Post_ —which now specializes in printing run-of-the-mill stories about trade that rarely come close to justifying the sensational headlines, provocative subheads, or gripping leads — jumped all over the report as evidence that: ""Trade Barriers Could Threaten Global Economy: World Bank Finds Protectionist Trend.""   
  
Well, we all know that trade barriers **do** threaten the global economy — in times of economic expansion and contraction. But most of the measures cited in the report are not particularly spectacular or unusual from a trade perspective. For better or worse, most WTO member countries do have some latitude to raise trade barriers — sometimes unconditionally. But also, in any given year, governments institute policies that happen to have adverse affects on trade (even if the measure wasn’t intended to be protectionist).   
  
Sometimes aggrieved interests in affected countries prevail upon their governments to protest or otherwise seek resolution. And more often than not, under those circumstances, resolution is achieved. But sometimes, a protectionist measure doesn’t even provoke any kind of protest. So, quantifying protectionist measures is one thing, but qualifying them is quite another, more important exercise, if one is interested in making judgments about protectionist trends.   




The by-line of the WP story belongs to Anthony Faiola, who last week wrote story titled: ""U.S. to Toughen Its Stance on Trade: New Policy Reflects Growing Dissatisfaction With Global Markets."" The lead paragraph of the story read: 



The Obama administration is aggressively reworking U.S. trade policy to more strongly emphasize domestic and social issues, from the displacement of American workers to climate change.



But nothing in the story supports the assertion that anyone is ""aggressively reworking U.S. trade policy."" Nothing supports the subhead that there is a growing dissatisfaction with global markets. Trade policy may be in for some changes simply because there’s a new sheriff in town, who is beholden (to what extent we shall see) to interests that oppose competition, but not because of dissatisfaction with global markets.   
  
Certainly there is no evidence of dissatisfaction with global markets in the story, which was occasioned by Ron Kirk’s confirmation hearing as U.S. Trade Representative. Kirk testified—before a Senate that already has before it legislation to make enforcement, rather than negotiation, the priority of trade policy for the next couple years—that he intends to focus on enforcement, rather than negotiation. Well, duh! What else is a nominee whose fate depends on the blessing of the people who want more enforcement going to say? For the record, it’s been known for quite some time that the administration would focus on systematizing enforcement efforts, so that’s not really news.   
  
What is newsworthy, however, are the parts of Ron Kirk’s testimony that went unrevealed in Faiola’s reporting. For example, Kirk said that ""at an appropriate time and with proper congressional input and concerns addressed,"" the administration would ask Congress to grant the president fast-track trade negotiating authority, which is a tool required only by presidents interested in negotiating and expanding trade.   
  
Kirk also said that ""We are mindful that the benefits of trade are diffuse, while its pain is often concentrated. It is within that context that we seek to restore and build new bipartisan support for a progressive trade agenda for America."" Where, then, is the reporting that the Obama administration does not reject trade? Where is the headline that Obama seeks support for a progressive trade agenda? (Cato is publishing a paper next month by Scott Lincicome and me that explains how President Obama can help restore the pro-trade consensus, which includes a large section on the role the media has played in perpetuating destructive myths about trade and globalization).   
  
Where is the reporting that Democrats in Congress are not all opposed to trade liberalization? Senate Finance Committee chairman Max Baucus told Kirk during the hearing: ""I also want to find a way to begin consideration of the three pending trade agreements. We should start with Panama. That’s the agreement that’s most ready for action. And it’s the agreement that will win the greatest level of support."" Reporting on these matters would be newsworthy and constructive since so few in the media seem to be willing to publish stories that contravene conventional wisdom about trade.   
  
The fact of the matter is that there isn’t any discernible trend toward protectionism in the United States or in the world right now. World leaders issue warnings about the consequences of protectionism, but there are not trends. There are incidences, but no trends. The ballyhooed World Bank paper cites 78 trade measures ""proposed and/or implemented,"" 66 of which involved trade restrictions, 47 of which eventually took effect. The long footnote associated with the presentation of these numbers (footnote 1) includes the following sentence: ""It is important to note that it is difficult to distinguish the trade policy measures that are taken in response to the current crisis from measures that might have been taken anyway.""   
  
Most of the 47 measures cited in the report happened in November and December of 2008, and Faiola already ranted about them in the WP on December 22, 2008: 



Moving to _shield battered_ domestic manufacturers from foreign imports, Indonesia is _slapping_ restrictions on at least 500 products this month, demanding special licenses and new fees on imports. Russia is hiking tariffs on imported cars, poultry and pork. France is launching a state fund to protect French companies from foreign takeovers. Officials in Argentina and Brazil are seeking to raise tariffs on products from imported wine and textiles to leather goods and peaches, according to the World Trade Organization.



There may be nothing necessarily incorrect about the facts reported. But the tone and implications are possibly misleading. It is hard to accept the otherwise marginally significant facts without also accepting the provocative metaphors and sense of impending doom. Those actions have less antagonistic explanations and more benign interpretations.   
  
For example, the actions of Indonesia, Argentina, and Brazil are consistent with their rights under the WTO agreements and will have a negligible collective impact on world trade. Russia is not even a member of the WTO and frequently behaves outside of international norms, so its actions have very limited representative value. And France has intervened to block foreign takeovers of French companies on other occasions this decade, so its actions are not particularly noteworthy.   
  
At least the World Bank study is careful enough to report some of the positive trade developments and reasons for optimism that I discuss in more detail in this paper that Cato published last week. The World Bank notes 10 instances of trade liberalization around the world, which presumably includes Mexico’s admirable decision to reduce tariff rates on 70 percent of the products listed in its tariff schedule; Brazil’s decision to scrap tariffs on certain raw materials, components, capital goods; China’s decision to forego inclusion of Buy China provisions in its own massive spending bill; and the signing of new free trade agreements between Australia, New Zealand, and the ASEAN countries.   
  
The WB study, like my paper, points out that the sturdy legal and institutional infrastructure of the GATT/WTO system combined with the fact of growing interdependence between countries that are now linked by transnational supply chains will likely diminish prospects for more consequential protectionist indulgences.   
  
Of course Anthony Faiola is not the only person at _The Washington Post_ guilty of hyping protectionist rhetoric and war metaphors in trade stories (and the WP is not the only media outlet engaging in hype). But one of the more egregious disconnects between headline/subhead/lead and the body of the story is found in an article on U.S.-China trade relations by Faiola’s colleague, Ariana Eunjung Cha (which is dissected and analyzed here).   
  
World policymakers and policy watchers do need to be vigilant about ensuring that the world doesn’t descend into a protectionist abyss. They will have plenty of help from their domestic constituencies who rely on open trade in both directions. But some vigilance must be reserved for a media that, if left unchallenged, could provoke a trade war on its own. The more reporting there is about protectionist measures—even if it is just more reporting about the same protectionist measures (as today’s WP article is)—the more justified or compelled policymakers will eventually feel in turning to that poison. If a Congressman’s aide can point to articles that cite rising protectionism, even if the measures cited don’t justify the label of protectionism, it becomes less taboo to propose or support protectionist policies. That kind of fear mongering needs to be identified as such.   
  
Yes, some countries are likely to dabble in some degree of protectionism—either with border measures or the more camouflaged regulatory variety. But the costs of that protectionism will quickly become apparent in a world where capital and talent flow to the jurisdictions with the fewest physical and administrative frictions.   
  
Maybe that story will be written as the economy is on its way back up.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSurprise in Western Europe: Hot Summer of 1540 Was Significantly Hotter Than Assumed Record Holder 2003
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt
In Western Europe the summer of 2012 was for the most part pretty lousy (see our blog report “When are we ever going to have a summer?“). It wasn’t until mid August that summer showed its stuff and sent thermometers shooting upwards for a few days.
Things were much different in 2003 when Western Europe baked under a heat zone. Back then the heat wave ground everyday living to a halt. During the first two weeks of August new records were set in Great Britain (38.1°C), Germany (40.2°C), and Switzerland (41.5°C) and Portugal (47.5°C).
For a long time it was assumed that the heat wave of 2003 was unique for the last 1000 years, and that there had never been such a heat wave in Europe during that time. It turns out that this was an error. At the end of July, 2012, Oliver Wetter and Christian Pfister of the University of Bern in Switzerland published a new study in the Journal Climate of the Past Discussion. The study shows that temperatures during a Swiss heat-wave summer in the year 1540 was significantly hotter than the summer of 2003. The two scientists write a short summary of their work:
This paper challenges the argument obtained from the analysis of grape harvest (GHD) and maximum latewood density (MXD) data that the 2003 heat-wave in Western Europe was the most extreme warm anomaly in the last millennium. We have evidence that the heat and drought in 1540 known from numerous contemporary narrative documentary reports is not adequately reflected in these estimates. Vines severely suffered from the extreme heat and drought which led vine-growers to postpone the harvest in hope for a rain spell. At the time of harvest many grapes had already become raisins. Likewise, many trees suffered from premature leaf fall probably as a result of a decreased net photosynthesis, as it was measured in 2003. To more realistically assess 1540′s spring–summer (AMJJ) temperature we present a new Swiss series of critically evaluated GHD. Basing on three different approaches considering the drought effect on vines, temperatures were assessed between 4.3 °C and 6.3 °C (including the Standard Error of Estimate (SEE) of 0.52 °C) above the 1901–2000 mean which is significantly higher than the value of 2.9 °C measured in 2003. Considering the significance of soil moisture deficits for extreme heat-waves this result still needs to be validated with estimated seasonal precipitation from independent evidence.”

"The UK’s greenhouse gas emissions fell for a seventh consecutive year in 2019 after a record year for renewable energy, according to government figures. The provisional data, published by the government on Thursday, revealed a 3.6% fall in greenhouse gas emissions compared with 2018 and almost 28% from 2010.  Kwasi Kwarteng, the energy minister, said the figures show “the extraordinary progress the UK has made in tackling climate change”. “With record-breaking levels of renewable electricity on the grid we are well placed to build on these efforts in the months and years ahead, while continuing to support the economy through the coronavirus outbreak,” he said. The outbreak of the Covid-19 virus, and the lockdown of the UK, has already dented energy demand by an estimated 7%, according to Eurelectric, a pan-European trade association. British homes are using more electricity as people stay in and work from home, but this increase has been more than offset by the steep drop in demand for electricity at factories, construction sites and offices. Electricity demand is expected to fall further as major industries continue to close down to help stem the spread of the pandemic, which should help lead to lower overall emissions in 2020 alongside rising renewable energy generation. More than a third (36.9%) of the UK’s electricity was generated by renewable energy sources including wind farms, solar panels and biomass-fuelled power plants in 2019, a record for the sector. The average in the last three months of the year rose to 37.4%, the highest ever recorded for this time of year. Wind power alone generated almost a fifth of the UK’s electricity over the year as a whole, divided equally between onshore and offshore wind projects, in large part boosted by rising generation from the new Hornsea offshore wind project off the Yorkshire coast, which is the largest offshore wind farm in the world. Melanie Onn, RenewableUK’s deputy chief executive, said the records will continue as the UK moves away from fossil fuels to reach net zero emissions as fast as possible. “As well as wind, we’ll use innovative new technologies like renewable hydrogen and marine power, and we’ll scale up battery storage,” she said. “Low-cost renewables are central to the government’s energy strategy and our sector will grow rapidly in the years ahead, as our domestic supply chain expands and we continue to seize multibillion pound export opportunities around the world,” Onn added."
"When we think of North Korea, we think of a nation determined to be an outsider in the international community. Whether it’s testing nuclear weapons or threatening London hairdressers, the Democratic People’s Republic is never associated with compliance. But there is compelling evidence that the North Korean government is motivated by domestic power games to co-operate globally on climate change.  North Korea has a record of compliance with its obligations as a party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.  The obvious question then is why the North Korean government would show such commitment to the international climate change regime, given its belligerent reputation in the strategic realm. The most obvious link is between environmental degradation, the vulnerable agricultural system and the stability of governance in North Korea. The concept of climate change vulnerability is important there.   Climate change impacts – declining availability of food, water and energy, sea level rise, migration, and extreme weather events – pile more stress onto countries already at risk from internal instability and economic weakness.     Like many poor countries, North Korea, where such problems are endemic, is least able to cope with climate change impacts. These weaknesses include food insecurity, energy shortages, economic fragility and a own rigid political system. So North Korea is using the UNFCCC as a vehicle for projects designed to increase agricultural output and build the resilience of the agricultural system to disasters.   The country exists in a state of near-perpetual food insecurity (the FAO estimates a food deficit of 207,000 tonnes in 2012-2013), stemming from a structural food deficit along with an inability and unwillingness to buy food from international markets.  In these circumstances, any disruption to domestic agricultural production will have a significant impact on the food security of at-risk segments of the population, creating ripple effects across the country’s economy and political system.  This illustrates the degree to which food insecurity is an existential problem for the North Korean leadership.   Degradation of the land base is another critical problem requiring technical assistance.  Land degradation in the DPRK is a symptom of ideological rigidity in land management, climatic impacts and the country’s energy shortages, exacerbating food insecurity.   The capacity-building assistance made available via the UNFCCC and related programs boosting planting and harvesting efficiency, building soil fertility and reforestation helps to increase the productive capacity of the agricultural sector and enhance its resilience against climate change. The incentives for participation are not confined to agriculture.  North Korea is using the UNFCCC as a vehicle for obtaining foreign assistance to upgrade its energy production and transmission infrastructure.   North Korea’s energy security problem is well documented, revolving around four distinct challenges: supply, generation, power transmission, and secondary usage.  Of these four challenges, electricity generation and transmission are the two that can be addressed through the UNFCCC.   Renewable energy may be the most appropriate vehicle for increasing generation capacity because unlike large centralised fossil-fuels, renewables can be scaled locally which reduces their up-front cost.   For example, a UNDP-sponsored project is installing small-scale wind energy systems at sites across North and South Pyongan Provinces, helping to alleviate energy shortages affecting these areas by decoupling them from reliance on the coal-generated electricity grid.   Most significantly, renewables offer North Korea considerable scope for technology transfer, infrastructure upgrades and income through the Clean Development Mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol.   Technology transfers for such projects do not violate the import restrictions of dual-use technologies listed under the UN Security Council sanctions regime against the DPRK. The income potential derives from the carbon credits generated by North Korea’s renewable projects, which can be traded on international carbon markets.   While there is revenue potential in the generation and sale of carbon credits, the magnitude of the potential revenue is comparatively small.  Together, the  projects already online in North Korea account for 193,475 carbon credits.  At the EU spot price for carbon credits of $US 5.66/ton (4.24 €/ton) as of July 2013, North Korea’s current portfolio of carbon credits are worth a mere $US 1m per year.   North Korea has strong incentives to fight climate change and its potential to erode government control. The fact that the nation has become more compliant over time suggests that the objectives of the international climate change regime coalesce with the survival imperatives of Kim Jong-un’s government.

"The Tesla Model S electric car arrives in the UK this week. On the face of it this appears just another car launch, but is in fact something closer to a revolution.  The Tesla Model S is the first battery-electric luxury car to be sold in Britain, and it succeeds the limited edition Tesla Roadster, an electric sportscar built by British manufacturer Lotus in Norfolk and based on its Elise. The Roadster was the car that put the Tesla brand on the map and concentrated many minds in the more orthodox automotive industry on the rising potential for electric vehicles (EV). Elon Musk, famous for his role developing PayPal and the SpaceX spaceflight company, regards his Tesla cars as the Apple of the automotive sector, arguing that like Apple’s products, the quality and design of Tesla cars allow them to command a premium price. Nevertheless, the £50,000 price tag (after government subsidy) makes it competitive with equivalent luxury cars from BMW or Jaguar. In terms of styling, many feel it is among the best in that segment. The Model S is also the first EV, depending on which battery option is chosen, with a range not unlike cars with conventional internal combustion engines – striking a blow to the “range anxiety” that electric vehicles supposedly cause. Further evidence of Tesla’s roots in Silicon Valley can be seen in the dashboard – a control screen, like a large iPad – and the fact that much of the car’s software can be reconfigured remotely. Where most traditional manufacturers’ cars would require a trip to the dealer for any software updates (if they bother at all), in the case of the Tesla such updates are carried out regularly, overnight, while the car is charging in its garage. Tesla uses online updates to address any software problems and upgrade the car’s intelligent systems. The Model S “operating system” is installed in two hard drives that run in parallel, so that the car can still operate from one even while the other is upgraded. The UK is relatively late to enjoy the Model S, probably due to the need to reconfigure the car for right hand drive. Tesla sold 17,650 cars in the US last year, making it the third best selling electric car after the plug-in hybrid Chevrolet Volt (23,094), and the battery-electric Nissan Leaf (22,610), the latter selling at half the price of the Tesla. This puts it ahead in terms of sales of the plug-in Toyota Prius, and many electric and hybrid cars from more mainstream manufacturers. In fact, the Model S has become a kind of cult car among North American celebrities and other wealthy motorists keen to display their green credentials. In Europe, Tesla is enjoying healthy sales in EV-friendly markets such as Norway, where 20% of all new cars sold in March were electric, and more Teslas were sold than any other car. In the Netherlands some 35,000 EVs are now registered. In terms of total EV sales, including hybrids, the Netherlands was the largest EU market in 2013 with around 25,000 registrations, followed by France with 15,000 and Norway with around 7,000. The UK came in fifth place with around 4,000 – after Germany (with how many?), where high speed Autobahns that sap battery power and loyalty to local manufacturers have kept EV sales down.  Looking at these numbers, it may seem that the Model S will struggle to sell well in Britain. On the other hand, although most EVs sold here so far have been quite utilitarian vehicles used to beat the London congestion charge, with steady sales of the Nissan Leaf, the UK supports a healthy luxury car market. There are no shortage of millionaires and billionaires residing here, so the Model S may find more buyers than for the cheaper models already here. A further boost may come from Tesla’s innovative sales model. The company favours “experience centres” in shopping malls, a style that has fallen foul of car dealer groups in the US and franchise laws in certain states, prompting a series of lawsuits. LINK Due to quite different car distribution regulation, this is easier to implement in Europe, and Tesla centres in the UK are expected in large up-market shopping centres with London, Birmingham and Manchester among the first locations."

by Roy W. Spencer, Ph. D.


LiveScience.com posted an article yesterday where the usual IPCC suspects (Gavin Schmidt, Kevin Trenberth, and Andy Dessler) dissed our recent paper in in the journal Remote Sensing.
Given their comments, I doubt any of them could actually state what the major conclusion of our paper was.
For example, Andy Dessler told LiveScience:

“He’s taken an incorrect model, he’s tweaked it to match observations, but the conclusions you get from that are not correct…” 
Well, apparently Andy did not notice that those were OBSERVATIONS that disagreed with the IPCC climate models. And our model can quantitatively explain the disagreement.
Besides, is Andy implying the IPCC models he is so fond of DON’T have THEIR results tweaked to match the observations? Yeah, right.
Kevin Trenberth’s response to our paper, rather predictably, was:
“I cannot believe it got published”
Which when translated from IPCC-speak actually means, “Why didn’t I get the chance to deep-six Spencer’s paper, just like I’ve done with his other papers?”
Finally Gavin Schmidt claims that it’s the paleoclimate record that tells us how sensitive the climate system is, not the current satellite data. Oh, really? Then why have so many papers been published over the years trying to figure out how sensitive today’s climate system is? When scientists appeal to unfalsifiable theories of ancient events which we have virtually no data on, and ignore many years of detailed global satellite observations of today’s climate system, *I* think they are giving science a bad name.
COMMENTS ON THE FORBES ARTICLE BY JAMES TAYLOR
I have received literally dozens of phone calls and e-mails asking basically the same question: did James Taylor’s Forbes article really represent what we published in our Remote Sensing journal article this week?
Several of those people, including AP science reporter Seth Borenstein, actually read our article and said that there seemed to be a disconnect.
The short answer is that, while the title of the Forbes article (New NASA Data Blow Gaping Hole In Global Warming Alarmism) is a little over the top (as are most mainstream media articles about global warming science), the body of his article is — upon my re-reading of it — actually pretty good.
About the only disconnect I can see is we state in our paper that, while the discrepancy between the satellite observations were in the direction of the models producing too much global warming, it is really not possible to say by how much. Taylor’s article makes it sound much more certain that we have shown that the models produce too much warming in the long term. (Which I think is true…we just did not actually ‘prove’ it.)
But how is this any different than the reporting we see on the other side of the issue? Heck, how different is it than the misrepresentation of the certainty of the science in the IPCC’s own summaries for policymakers, versus what the scientists write in the body of those IPCC reports?
I am quite frankly getting tired of the climate ‘alarmists’ demanding that we ’skeptics’ be held a higher standard than they are held to. They claim our results don’t prove their models are wrong in their predictions of strong future warming, yet fail to mention they have no good, independent evidence their models are right.
For example….
…while our detractors correctly point out that the feedbacks we see in short term (year-to-year) climate variability might not indicate what the long-term feedbacks are in response to increasing CO2, the IPCC still uses short-term variability in their models to compare to satellite observations to then support the claimed realism of the long-term behavior of those models.
Well, they can’t have it both ways.
If they are going to validate their models with short term variability as some sort of indication that their models can be believed for long-term global warming, then they are going to HAVE to explain why there is such a huge discrepancy (see Fig. 3 in our paper) between the models and the satellite observations in what is the most fundamental issue: How fast do the models lose excess radiant energy in response to warming?
That is essentially the definition of “feedback”, and feedbacks determine climate sensitivity.
I’m sorry, but if this is the best they can do in the way of rebuttal to our study, they are going to have to become a little more creative.

"**Next week England will come out of a blanket lockdown with areas once again divided into tiers, governing what people can and cannot do.**
The announcement of the rules, which will come into force from 2 December, has prompted questions and concerns from business owners and families.
Some areas with lower infection rates feel they have been unfairly targeted, while others feel that, despite having been through four weeks of lockdown, they are no further forward.
""They have changed the rules in the middle of the game,"" Amanda Thompson, managing director of amusement park Blackpool Pleasure Beach, says of the new restrictions.
The seaside resort had an infection rate of 205 cases per 100,000 in the week to 22 November, considerably lower than other areas of Lancashire. Ms Thompson has been trying to work out how she will make it to Christmas.
""I had a pantomime due to start next week, a dinner show due to begin, a lot of people who have been unemployed all year because they are performers unable to perform.""
The amusement park, which is almost 125 years old, has survived two world wars only to be bought to a ""grinding halt"" this year.
""Without Blackpool Pleasure Beach there is no Blackpool. Perhaps people don't find it interesting in London but it is of interest to the millions of people who come here.""
While the resort had been operating in a Covid-secure way over the summer, Ms Thompson says it will now be closed until next year unless restrictions are relaxed.
""Â£250,000 of cancellations came in yesterday,"" she says, calling for VAT to be kept low for ""the next 18 months at least"" to help businesses.
For comedian Nina Gilligan, the return to the top level of restrictions means her diary has ""flat-lined"".
""My understanding is that venues won't be opening and I have already had a couple of gigs pulled.""
The industry has been ""decimated"" by the pandemic, she says, despite a brief period over the summer when things picked up.
""I have got one gig in Liverpool in a car park. People will be honking at me. There is very little for performers, it is getting very tight.""
Gilligan, who lives in east Manchester, accepts the country has to ""do the right thing to keep infections down"". But she fears the long-term impact on her industry, even if performers can - theoretically - travel outside their tiers to work.
""I am a north-west based comedian, I am unlikely to be gigging in London. You can't jump ship and become an established act on the London circuits. It is tricky,"" she says.
Tier two restrictions could spell the end for many grassroots music venues, Henry Conlon warns. He owns the Dublin Castle in Camden, north London, where bands such as Madness, Blur and The Killers got their breaks.
""It's not an even playing field,"" Mr Conlon says. ""I can go to a restaurant and drink as much as I like. But the vast majority of music venues don't have kitchens - like the Dublin Castle.""
Under tier two rules pubs can only open if they serve substantial meals.
Music venues in this tier can reopen, but must follow strict new guidelines around social distancing.
""The creative industry is a major part of the British economy that brings in a lot of income,"" says Mr Conlon. ""We need to support every part of that sector, and safeguard the grassroots where bands get started.
There's no profit to be made with venues that are only a quarter-full, he says.
""We've got sound engineers, security staff, lighting teams and bar staff to pay. Scrap the requirement to have a substantial meal with a drink. Let us get on with it. We're not idiots, we've always been responsible with not letting our customers get out of control.""
""It's just been such a long slog,"" says Anupa Roper. ""It's just that feeling that there's no end to it.""
Anupa, 42, lives in Countesthorpe, which will move to tier three, along with the rest of Leicestershire, from 2 December. Meanwhile, her parents and in-laws live in Leicester, which was subject to the UK's first local lockdown in June and has been under some level of coronavirus restrictions since March.
This meant family gatherings had been limited to a handful of birthday celebrations in the garden over the summer. Her parents and in-laws haven't seen their grandchildren, aged 10 and 11, since August.
Anupa has been dropping shopping off to her parents, but hasn't been going inside their house to avoid putting them at risk.
""My mother-in-law is in her 70s and finds it really difficult not seeing the children,"" she says. ""For my in-laws in particular they've not got smartphones and they can't do Zoom or FaceTime or anything.""
Anupa says the family understand the need for restrictions to keep people safe - but they had been hoping measures might be eased after this month's national lockdown. Whilst over the summer they could meet up outside, living under tougher restrictions during the winter will make this less feasible, Anupa says.
""It's been a long year."""
"The North Atlantic may be a weaker climate ally than previously believed, according to a study that suggests the ocean’s capacity to absorb carbon dioxide has been overestimated. A first-ever winter and spring sampling of plankton in the western North Atlantic showed cell sizes were considerably smaller than scientists assumed, which means the carbon they absorb does not sink as deep or as fast, nor does it stay in the depths for as long.  This discovery is likely to force a negative revision of global climate calculations, say the authors of the Nasa-backed study, though it is unclear by how much. “We have found a misconception. It will definitely impact the model of carbon flows,” said Oregon State University microbiologist Steve Giovannoni. “It will require more than just a small tweak.” Researchers say the spring phytoplankton bloom in the North Atlantic is probably the largest annual biological carbon sequestration mechanism on the planet. Like a vast forest of tiny plants in the sunlight upper part of the ocean, they draw down carbon dioxide through photosynthesis. The bigger the plankton, the higher the chance they will sink into the deep mesopelagic zone of the ocean, where carbon can be trapped for more than 1,000 years. Until now, climate models have assumed that diatoms – one of the biggest types of plankton – were dominant. But the study, published in the International Society for Microbial Ecology Journal, reveals they are a very minor share of biomass when compared with much smaller cyanobacteria, picophytoeukaryotes and nanophytoeukaryotes. This was expected in winter, but the research team found that even in spring – shortly before the annual bloom – there were far fewer diatoms in the western North Atlantic than assumed “We asked, how could our impressions of this ocean region be so far off?” Giovannoni said. “There are three possibilities: new equipment that allows us to see smaller plankton more clearly, the fact that previous studies had focussed on more eastern regions, and climate change altering the biology of the ocean.” Although the findings of this study of one part of the North Atlantic – much of it carried out in fierce gales – do not necessarily apply to all oceans, Giovannoni said they highlight how little is understood of marine biology, as well as the need for close-up study. Nasa and other satellite monitoring agencies have previously used images from space to assess the carbon draw-down capacity of algae blooms, but they will need to revise the assumptions on which their calculations are based. • The headline on this article was amended on 4 April 2020 to make clear that the story is about the North Atlantic, not all oceans as suggested in an earlier version."

It has been a decade since that beautiful September day when terrorists brought down the World Trade Center, damaged the Pentagon, and killed thousands of Americans. Unfortunately, in important ways the terrorists have won. The U.S. is different: less confident, less secure, and less free. We have suffered through a disastrous decade.



The 9/11 attacks were an atrocity, impossible to justify whatever the grievances of others against America. Terrorism — targeting civilians to achieve political ends — is an immoral means, irrespective of the end.



Yet that catastrophic day demonstrated that Americans were not invulnerable, exempt from retaliation as their government intervened around the world. There are many reasons why some foreigners hate the U.S., and polls indicate that it is primarily Washington’s policies, not America’s people, freedoms, or products, which others loathe. The willingness to kill, and especially the readiness to die doing so, typically reflects a deep desire to effect political change.



Terrorism long has been a political tool of those who are weak. Terrorists assassinated two czars, who ruled the autocratic Russian Empire. In June 1914 a terrorist killed the heir to the Austro‐​Hungarian Empire, triggering World War I. Terrorists, including suicide bombers, have targeted India, Israel, Sri Lanka, and Russia. Robert Pape of the University of Chicago has demonstrated that most of these killers are motivated by government policies, usually occupying territory and people.



Seeking to understand terrorism does not mean justifying murder. But it does suggest that policies can be adjusted to minimize antagonism. Sometimes it is necessary to make enemies. However, it is foolish to make enemies without good reason.



Unfortunately, the Bush administration took the popular but deluded position that terrorists attacked America because it was beautiful, that Americans were killed because they were so free. President George W. Bush ignored the importance of U.S. government policies on the attitudes of others. For instance, the U.S. was imposing a high profile, destructive embargo against Iraq (when confronted about the human cost, then‐​UN Ambassador Madeleine Albright responded “we think the price is worth it”) and backing oppressive Israeli occupation policies in the West Bank (few Americans would docilely accept decades of foreign rule). Even Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz said the deployment of U.S. military forces in Saudi Arabia had “been a huge recruiting device for al‐​Qaeda.” It was time to ask: Were the costs of such policies greater than the benefits?



Failing to diagnose the cause of the attacks turned America’s legendary confidence into paranoia. People saw the U.S. under siege, compared 9/11 to Pearl Harbor, and termed the war on terror as World War III. Our way of life was threatened; the nation’s future was in the balance. Officials also promoted a climate of fear because it served their political interest.



Truth be told, terrorism never posed an existential threat to America. Even after 9/11, the risk of being a victim of a terrorist incident in the U.S. was minimal. And the likelihood that terrorists could “defeat” America, whatever that would mean, was even less.



Europeans, who lived through two horrendous conflicts which ravaged their continent in the 20th century, took a more measured approach to combating terrorism — which was far more persistent in Europe than in America. In contrast, the U.S. government dramatically over‐​reacted, turning American society upside down, militarizing foreign policy, doubling Pentagon spending, curbing civil liberties, creating vast new security bureaucracies, and placing terrorism at the center of politics. For all of the Bush administration’s choreographed bluster, its policy smacked of panic. Argued Michael Hirsh in _National Journal_ , “It is hard to escape the conclusion that al‐​Qaida outthought America — at least provoking Washington to make the wrong strategic choices at the outset.”



Indeed, President Bush guaranteed failure by adopting the neoconservative agenda as his own. It was imperative that Washington punish the Taliban for hosting al‐​Qaeda, but the administration quickly focused on Iraq, which had no connection to 9/11 and no weapons of mass destruction. Of course, many people believed the latter, in large part due to the administration’s careful molding of equivocal and contradictory evidence, essentially dismissing any doubts anyone had about what turned out to be utterly fanciful claims. No one wanted to believe that high administration officials would conjure up “mushroom clouds” from so little. But they did. The result was what President Barack Obama recently called a “hard decade of war.”



The quick shift from Afghanistan to Iraq had extraordinarily important consequences. The administration left the former conflict unfinished, attempting to nation‐​build on the cheap. Hirsh noted that Washington “began diverting money and attention to Iraq within weeks of the fall of the Taliban.” Afghanistan became secondary. For four years, wrote Pakistani journalist Ahmed Rashid, the U.S. failed to monitor “Taliban activity in four southern provinces — Helmand, Kandahar, Uruzgan, and Nimroz — or across the border in Quetta” because of inadequate human and satellite intelligence: “the Iraq war had drained away resources.”



Equally bad, as Rashid documented in _Descent into Chaos_ , Bush administration officials were played for fools by the Pakistan government, which protected Taliban leaders and enabled the insurgents to quickly revive. Whether creating a stable and effective central government in Kabul was ever possible is impossible to know, but President Bush made failure likely despite President Barack Obama’s desperate attempt to recover lost ground.



Even worse, the administration initiated a completely unnecessary war of choice in Iraq based on ignorant assumptions, unrealistic expectations, and costly illusions. Indeed, administration hawks consciously excluded officials who actually knew something about Iraq from post‐​war planning. In a major understatement, former Secretary of State Colin Powell observed: “Mr. Cheney and many of his colleagues did not prepare for what happened after the fall of Baghdad.”



The presumed “cakewalk” led to years of guerrilla conflict and the destruction of Iraqi society. The Iraqi Body Count reports that officially recorded civilian deaths run between 102,000 and 112,000, with another 15,000 suggested by the WikiLeaks State Department cables. But the IBC figures the actual death toll to be at least twice as high, and other estimates race upwards towards a million. _Lancet_ recently published a new study which figured more than 12,000 deaths from suicide bombings alone. More than four million Iraqis were displaced from their homes, many forced overseas. Many others were kidnapped, robbed, or otherwise traumatized. Add in the casualties from Afghanistan and the numbers are astronomical.



Eventually looming disaster in both theaters forced a response, less effective because it was late. In a new Rand Corporation volume, _The Long Shadow of 9/11_ , former U.S. ambassador James Dobbins wrote: “reinforcing only under the pressure of failure has thus proved a far more expensive approach to nation‐​building than was the strategy developed in the 1990s of going in heavily, establishing a safe and secure environment quickly, and then drawing down gradually once peace had been established and potential adversaries deterred.”



At the same time Iraq created a marvelously effective recruiting tool for al‐​Qaeda. Rather than kill terrorists before they attacked, say, Kansas City, as Bush administration officials claimed might happen, the U.S. created terrorists who assaulted American troops in Iraq — and civilians in allied nations. Some of the insurgents who gained combat training fighting U.S. forces in Iraq have turned up battling Moammar Qaddafi’s government in the recent Libyan civil war.



The Bush administration made much of its alleged commitment to democracy, but in practice President Bush’s devotion to political freedom remained as inconsistent and hypocritical as that of his predecessors. Argued Dobbins: “American policy is seen by most of the Middle East as at best cynically opportunistic and at worst anti‐​democratic, a perception that the invasion and botched occupation of Iraq did nothing to correct.”



Iraq also empowered the most destabilizing force in the Middle East, Iran. With Saddam Hussein’s overthrow, Iraq’s Shiite majority gained control and established close ties with the Shia‐​majority regime next door. U.S. officials have only reluctantly and perhaps not entirely abandoned the dream of permanent bases in Iraq to contain Tehran, but no government in Baghdad is ever likely to follow such a policy. Iraqis do not want to be dominated by the Iranian regime, but they certainly are not going to do Washington’s dirty work against friendly fellow Muslims.



Ironically, Barack Obama dramatically demonstrated the shortsightedness of the Bush administration’s “war‐​first” policy. A mixture of enhanced intelligence, international cooperation, and Special Forces operations was always the better way to address terrorism. These tactics have done the most to greatly weaken al‐​Qaeda. They also killed Osama bin Laden, nearly a decade after the Bush administration failed to close the net around him in Afghanistan at Tora Bora. While targeted raids and drone strikes are not problem free — they have helped make the U.S. extraordinarily unpopular in Pakistan, especially given the widespread belief that innocents are routinely killed — they are far less costly and create far less hostility than bombing, invading, and occupying entire nations.



Washington’s post‐​9/​11 policies made America less safe. The Bush and Obama administrations squandered thousands of lives and hundreds of billions of dollars in unnecessary wars. The constant fighting and endless occupation badly strained the U.S. military; President Bush’s “us or them” attitude frayed alliances. The willingness to trample life and liberty of anyone thought to be in the way lost America the international goodwill that it gained right after the 9/11 attacks.



At the same time as it was making war in the Middle East and Central Asia, the Bush administration was turning the American heartland into a battlefield. While it is oft‐​said that the Constitution is not a suicide pact, one of the country’s hallmarks is its commitment to individual liberty. Increases in government power should be carefully considered, limited to steps necessary to meet serious and real threats, and constrained by effective oversight and accountability.



President Bush demanded power, but essentially without limits. Like the Clinton administration before it after the Oklahoma City bombing, the Bush administration cobbled together a wish list of investigative and prosecutorial powers, many unrelated to preventing another 9/11, and almost none subject to congressional or judicial review.



Indeed, the administration ostentatiously claimed the president to be essentially an elective dictator, possessing unlimited “war powers” authorizing him to do anything believed necessary to defend the U.S., including ordering the arrest of an American citizen on U.S. soil and his incarceration without limit and with no recourse to an attorney or the courts. Since the battleground was America and the war was unending (there will always be a potential threat of a terrorist attack), all constitutional rights were theoretically subordinate to the president’s whim.



Ironically, the president who insisted that America was attacked because “they” hated our freedoms did much to destroy American freedoms. He was so effective that his program almost looked like a conscious attempt to eliminate al-Qaeda’s cause for acting. Unfortunately, making America less free did not appease bin Laden.



In the two and a half years that he’s been in office, President Obama has changed the tone of the war on terror. However, he has left his predecessor’s militarist international strategy largely intact. Only time will tell whether Washington’s intervention in Libya’s civil war created a new terrorist opening, since Islamic extremists were among the beneficiaries of Qaddafi’s fall. Equally disappointing, the president has done little to restore lost civil liberties at home, let alone punish Bush administration officials for violating the law, especially for the use of torture.



The U.S. once was “a shining city on a hill,” as President Ronald Reagan often said. But America has changed since 9/11. The U.S. is less confident, secure, and free. Sadly, the nation’s most grievous wounds are self‐​inflicted. And America’s transformation may be permanent.

Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee launched his presidential campaign last week. Huckabee highlighted his fiscal successes as governor during his announcement. He claims that he cut taxes 94 times while governor, and he promised to bring his tax-cutting experience to Washington, D.C. Huckabee’s statements do not tell the full story. While Huckabee cut some taxes, his time in office also included a rapid increase in Arkansas state spending and multiple tax hikes.   
  
Huckabee took office in July 1996 after Governor Jim Guy Tucker was convicted for his involvement in the Whitewater scandal. Shortly after taking office, Huckabee signed a $70 million package of income tax cuts. It eliminated the marriage penalty, increased the standard deduction, and indexed tax brackets to inflation. The broad-based tax cut was Arkansas’s first in 20 years. Huckabee followed it with a large cut to the state’s capital gains tax. These tax cuts were popular, and they improved Arkansas’s economic climate.   
  
Huckabee’s fiscal policies then changed direction. Huckabee used the state’s tobacco settlement money to expand Medicaid, and he supported a large bond initiative to increase spending for infrastructure. These and other spending policies came with a hefty price tag.   




When Huckabee was in office during fiscal year 1997, Arkansas general fund spending was $2.6 billion, according to data from the National Association of State Budget Officers. By 2007, Huckabee’s last year in office, general fund spending had grown by 54 percent to $4 billion. Total state spending--which includes spending from federal aid and other non-general sources--grew even faster. Over the same period, it rose from $8.3 billion to $16.1 billion, an increase of 94 percent.   
  
Huckabee relied upon multiple tax increases to fund this rapid spending growth. According to data from the state of Arkansas, examined by the _Washington Post_ , net taxes increased by $505 million during Huckabee’s tenure. Huckabee supported increases in the state gasoline, cigarette, and sales taxes. He instituted a three percent personal income surtax.   
  
Huckabee’s scores on Cato’s Fiscal Policy Report Card show his growing embrace of big government. Cato’s report card includes various measures of tax and spending restraint, and assigns governors grades on an A through F scale. Below are Huckabee’s scores:   






In 2006 Huckabee tied for the worst-rated Republican governor. The authors of the report summarized Huckabee’s fiscal record: “Like many Republicans, his grades dropped the longer he stayed in office…Huckabee’s leadership has left taxpayers in Arkansas much worse off.”   
  
If elected president, Huckabee promises not to increase taxes and to control federal spending. However, given his proclivity for raising taxes and spending while governor, his promises ring hollow.   
  
Note: This post is part of a series on the fiscal records of governors running for president. Previous editions covered include Martin O’Malley and Jeb Bush.

"Barclays has bowed to investor pressure over its climate track record and announced plans to shrink its carbon footprint to net zero by 2050. The bank, which has its headquarters in London, has pledged to align all of its financing activities with the goals and timelines of the Paris agreement, starting with the energy and power sectors, and to publish “transparent targets” to track its progress. The proposal will be put to an investor vote at its annual general meeting on 7 May and is part of the response to a separate shareholder resolution urging the bank to phase out all lending and services to energy and fossil fuel companies that fail to align with Paris climate goals. The campaign group ShareAction – which spearheaded the shareholder vote – said the net zero commitment was a “milestone announcement” for the lender. However, ShareAction is calling on investors to back both resolutions, to ensure the bank actually pulls its services from the largest carbon emitters, rather than just offsetting them with alternative investments or services to other sectors. Barclays has been the top European financier of fossil fuels in the last four years and is the seventh largest globally, according to a recent report by the Rainforest Action Network. The bank has provided more than $118bn (£95.2bn) worth of financial services to carbon-intensive companies and projects since the Paris agreement was signed in 2016 and was the largest financier of Arctic oil and gas last year. Natasha Landell-Mills, the head of stewardship at the asset manager Sarasin & Partners, a co-filer of ShareAction’s resolution, said: “The message is powerful: continuing to finance activities that undermine planet stability is not in anyone’s interests – and certainly not shareholders. This is groundbreaking and the board deserves to be commended. Other banks should follow suit. “What matters now is that the board sets robust nearer-term targets that leave no doubt about its determination to deliver net zero emissions by 2050. Shareholders should underline their support for this by supporting not just Barclays’ resolution but also the shareholder-initiated resolution at Barclays’ forthcoming AGM.” Barclays is expected to consult with groups including ShareAction before it releases detailed targets by the end of the year and will release its first set of reports on its progress in 2021. The lender had come under mounting pressure in recent months after a number of high-profile investors publicly backed the ShareAction vote. The resolution – which was filed by a group of investment and pension funds managing more than £130bn of assets – gained the support of the top 25 shareholder Jupiter Asset Management, Europe’s largest asset manager Amundi, the Church of England’s investment arm and Nest – the largest UK pension fund by members. In an interim update to its climate policy, Barclays said it would restrict financing for companies that benefit from thermal coal activities but would continue funding some companies involved in controversial tar sands projects in Canada that aim to cut their emissions. Barclays will no longer support new Arctic drilling and will not finance fracking in the UK or Europe but will consider other global projects. Greenpeace UK’s senior climate adviser, Charlie Kronick, criticised the policy, which he said contradicted Barclays climate announcements. “The whole thing stinks of hypocrisy. It’s nothing but an attempt to pull the wool over the eyes of shareholders, who rightly want the bank to end its contribution to catastrophic climate breakdown.“Barclays remains Europe’s largest financier of these planet-heating industries and refuses to face up to the reality of the climate emergency and their role in fuelling it. Until it realises that getting to net zero means ambitious action to phase out support for all fossil fuels, this newly proposed resolution is absolutely meaningless.”"

Part Two: 



**Inequalities past and present**



We can start with the state of many developed economies. While they continue to grow in overall economic terms (if not as quickly as they once did), **they have too often failed to share the benefits** of that growth.



In many countries, while the very wealthiest have grown consistently wealthier, the rest have seen little or no real rise in their incomes or their living standards – over decades.



Inequalities that deepened with the great deregulating reforms of the 1980s and 90s have become **a permanent feature of these economies** – not a brief moment of pain.



 **That is certainly the case in New Zealand.**



As a small country, we are often at the forefront of global trends, because **we can move faster and sometimes further than our larger counterparts.** That was evident in the way we embraced – and sometimes pioneered – the free-market reforms of the 1980s and 90s.



Starting in 1984, through to the 1990s, we removed regulations that were said to hamper business, slashed subsidies, transformed the tax system, dramatically cut public spending and massively reduced welfare benefits paid to the sick, those caring for children and the unemployed.



Now we can argue whether those regulatory reforms were necessary, but regardless the numbers speak for themselves.



Within 20 years, my country lost its status as **one of the most equal** in the OECD. While incomes at the top doubled and GDP grew steadily, incomes at the bottom stagnated and **child poverty more than doubled.**



I was a child back then, but I remember clearly how society changed. I remember nothing of the Rogernomics of course– I was 5 and I was not the Doogie Howser of politics. But I do remember the human face. Especially the kids who just didn’t have the basics.



This experience is not New Zealand’s alone. It happened in many countries, often with deeper inequalities and more persistently stagnant real wages.



And the change hasn’t always been reversed yet. In fact, more recent trends have added new dimensions to the problem.



The financial crisis of a decade ago did not turn into another Great Depression, thankfully – but it has led to ongoing upheaval in the **global political economy.**



High debt and prolonged low interest rates have **inflated asset values,** widening inequalities in new ways. Most obviously for countries like New Zealand and Australia, **booming housing markets have put home ownership out of reach of a growing number of younger people** , especially when coupled with the debt many accumulate trying to further their education.



That same generation that is facing the prospect **of new challenges – climate change and digital transformation putting people out of work now and into the future.**



And just to add fuel to that already grim picture, **new forms of media and communication are changing how we understand what is happening in our societies – and how we connect with each other.** This change has opened up the world, in one sense – but it has also had the opposite effect of making us more distant, at times more entrenched. Stunningly, our most connected generation in New Zealand, has also been found to be our loneliest.



In the face of this fragmentation and disillusion, what does good government look like, not for us but for the very people who are turning away from us?



 **Two paths**



I’ve already mentioned one potential answer to this question.



In recent years, we have seen politicians and governments of all stripes respond to the stresses and challenges I have outlined by turning inwards.



Domestically, some have chosen to **reject** the independent and **expert public service** and the possibility of a mutually respectful and **diverse nation.**



Abroad, they **reject the international institutions** that they paint as responsible for both economic and cultural problems when they aren’t necessarily at fault.



So this is one answer that is available to people – and that some are signing up for. After all, **fear and blame is an easy political out.**



As I say, I understand how we got to this point. But I reject this answer.



Because there is another response. Instead of turning inwards, we can improve the institutions that have helped hold together this long period of **global peace** that we live in.



 **Instead of austerity measures** that only stretch the rich-poor divide, we can offer meaningful support – and more than just financially – to those at the bottom.



Instead of tearing down what works about our societies, we can build the system back up. We can acknowledge the areas where public policy hasn’t met the challenges of economic change, and do better.



One of the ways we can do this is by **widening our idea of what prosperity means.** Because if a country has been growing economically for 30 years, yet large numbers of its citizens haven’t felt the benefit, is it really moving forward?



If a country has a relatively high rate of GDP growth, but it is neglecting the things that we should all hold dear – like the health of our children, a warm, dry home for all, mental health services or rivers and lakes that we can swim in – then can it be said to be improving?

I was over at Judy Curry’s place, reading her update to the Mail on Sunday story, and noticed she referenced URLs to the updated FAQs at the BEST website. I followed and was totally shocked to read this FAQ: (bold mine)
Why didn’t Berkeley Earth wait for peer review?

Some people think that peer review consists of submitting a paper to a journal and waiting for the anonymous comments of referees. Traditional peer review is much broader than that and much more open. In science, when you have a new result, your first step is to present it to your colleagues by giving presentations, talks at local and international conferences, colloquia, and by sending out “preprints.” In fact, every academic department in the sciences had a preprint library where people would read up on the latest results. If they found something to disagree with, they would talk to or write the authors. Preprint libraries were so popular that, if you found someone was not in the office or lab, the first place you would search would be in the preprint library. Recently these rooms have disappeared, their place taken over by the internet. The biggest preprint library in the world now is a website, arXiv.org.
Such traditional and open peer review has many advantages. It usually results in better papers in the archival journals, because the papers are widely examined prior to publication. It does have a disadvantage, however, that journalists can also pick up preprints and report on them before the traditional peer-review process is finished.
Perhaps because of the media picking up on talks and preprints, a few journals made a new rule: they will not publish anything that is distributed as a preprint or that is discussed openly in a meeting or colloquium. This policy has resulted in more attention to several journals, but the restrictive approach had a detrimental effect on the traditional peer review system. Some fields of science, for example String Theory, objected so strongly that they refuse to publish in these journals, and they put all their papers online immediately.
The best alternative would be to have the media hold back and not report preprint material. Unfortunately they refuse to do that. The situation is made more difficult by the fact that many of the media misreport the content of the preprints. For that reason Berkeley Earth has tried to answer the questions given to us by the media, in hopes that our work will be more accurately reported. The two page summary of findings is also meant to help ensure that the media reports accurately reflect the content of our papers.
==============================================================
I call absolute total BS on that. Why?
Because BEST contacted media in advance of the release of their papers and provided preprints. The October 20th release by BEST was planned and coordinated with media, such as the Economist, Guardian, NYT, New Scientist, and Nature, all of which contacted me before the release on October 20th. This FAQ on peer review was added sometime after that date, I don’t know when, but the FAQ headline obviously refers to past tense.
Remember the ethical quandary I wrote about on October 15th? I wrote then:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Imagine, if you will, that you are given a complete draft copy of a new paper that has just been submitted to a journal, and that paper cites your work, and it was provided as a professional courtesy before it has been peer-reviewed and accepted.
There’s a caveat attached to the email with the paper which says:
“Please keep it confidential until we post it ourselves.”
OK, fine and dandy, no problem there. Happy to oblige. I sent along a couple of small corrections and thanked the author.
Imagine my surprise when I get this email Friday from a reporter at a major global media outlet. I’ve redacted the names.
Dear Mr Watts
I’m the [media name redacted] new environment editor. I’m planning to write a pretty big piece next week on the [paper preprint name redacted], and wondered whether you might be able to give me your view of it. I think you’ve been sent the  [paper preprint name redacted] paper… If you did happen to be able and interested, I’d be enormously grateful for a word about this on Monday. Might that be possible?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I objected to being put in an untenable position with confidentiality on the paper. I was asked for my confidentiality about one of the papers, but then they gave the paper to media, and the media came calling me asking me to comment on it. I had no warning they would do so.
The Economist was first and that’s the email from reporter James Astill above, and I had to ask permission from Dr. Richard Muller before I spoke with Astill, as I mentioned in my report on October 20th.
Elizabeth Muller told me herself that “this is coordinated for October 20th”. Dr. Richard Muller says he sent it to one outlet, but I got requests from other media outlets before October 20th release. How did that happen?
—–Original Message—–
From: Richard A Muller
Date: Friday, October 14, 2011 3:35 PM
To: Anthony Watts- ItWorks
Subject: Re: Our paper is attached
Anthony,
We sent a copy to only one media person, from The Economist, whom we trust to keep it confidential.  I sent a copy to you because I knew you would also keep it confidential.
I apologize for not having gotten back to you about your comments.  I particularly like your suggestion about the title; that is an improvement.
Rich
I have all my notes and emails from these exchange with BEST and media outlets who made request, so this isn’t a matter of recollection.
For example this from the WUWT contact form:

Subject    interview query from Nature magazine
2011-10-18 @ 12:05:13 PM
Hello Mr. Watts, I’m preparing a story about the formal release of the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature analysis on Thursday, and I was hoping to get your thoughts. Their embargoed release says they specifically looked at the temperature stations you flagged as suspect (as well as the urban heat island effect), and they say the trends hold true. Of course they already reported much of this unofficially back in May, but there you go. Would you have a moment to chat? My number is 212-451-xxxx. If I don’t hear back, I’ll see if I can’t track down your address through other means. Best, Jeff Tollefson US Correspondent Nature magazine
I wrote October 20th when the media blitz happened:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Readers may recall this post last week where I complained about being put in a uncomfortable quandary by an author of a new paper. Despite that, I chose to honor the confidentiality request of the author Dr. Richard Muller, even though I knew that behind the scenes, they were planning a media blitz to MSM outlets. In the past few days I have been contacted by James Astill of the Economist, Ian Sample of the Guardian, and Leslie Kaufman of the New York Times. They have all contacted me regarding the release of papers from BEST today.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Now BEST is telling us it is the media who refuses to hold back on reporting preprints? Give me a freaking break.
Either the Muller team is grossly incompetent at public relations, or they are playing a unbelievably stupid game of CYA after the fact due to the negative reactions they are getting to the “press before peer review” fiasco they brought on themselves.
Either way, it’s gobsmackingly unscrupulous of them to now blame the media.

"Habitat loss is the leading cause of biodiversity loss worldwide. Depending on their size, animals need a given amount of area to be able to find enough resources to maintain viable populations. But once the area of available habitat goes below a certain threshold, populations are no longer viable and species go locally extinct.  Another consequence of area loss is that the remaining habitat patches – and the populations of species that still live in them – become fragmented. Patches of pristine habitat become isolated by a “matrix” of inhospitable areas, preventing the movement of species between places where they could live. This loss and fragmentation also affects biodiversity inside remaining patches through “edge effects”. These are changes in natural communities at the boundaries (edges) of distinct habitats in the same ecosystem. For example, there may be abrupt changes in species abundance at the edges, due to drastic changes in environmental conditions such as temperature or humidity.  While there is debate over the relative impacts of loss and fragmentation on biodiversity, we know that it can have longlasting effects on everything from the amount and persistence of species within different areas, to community composition. And now our newly published research has shown that loss and fragmentation changes the way species within biological communities actually interact well before extinctions are detected. This has a serious effect on the stability of whole communities. As early as 1974, leading ecologist Daniel Janzen identified that habitat destruction brings about “the extinction of ecological interactions”. Janzen observed that these relationships between species (which range from interactions between prey and predator to mutually beneficial ones such as those between plants and the animals that pollinate them) are lost independently, and in a much more concealed way, than loss of species. For example, when habitat is fragmented, it becomes difficult for large predators to reach distant patches for hunting. This means that predator-prey interactions can weaken in more isolated areas. And this can have secondary effects on the community by enhancing prey species or more local, smaller predators. Since Janzen’s work, researchers have been looking for recurrent patterns in how networks of ecological interactions respond to habitat destruction. These networks link all species interactions within communities into a single web. For example, in a food web, when a predator eats a prey, this can have consequences for the resources used by the prey.   Studies in this area have revealed that ecological networks react to habitat loss in different ways, depending on the type of interaction. While networks of mutualistic interactions tend to break up into smaller networks, food webs tend to contract into a single smaller network. Mutualistic interactions also tend to become weaker (the species rely on each other less), while feeding relationships are stronger under habitat loss. But while this research has confirmed that habitat destruction deeply influences the way species interact, until now we have lacked a full understanding of the effects of habitat loss on community stability. Similarly, we have not known to what extent community responses change depending on the nature of habitat loss. For our study, we looked into these issues of community stability and response using a mathematical representation of an ecological system. This model simulates interactions and changes in species populations through time in a range of different landscapes – from pristine continuous habitats to highly fragmented habitats. These are based on what areas subjected to habitat loss look like in the real world.  Our results suggest that habitat loss affects community stability, through changes in ecological interactions, by altering the abundance and spatial distribution of species through time. And, as noted above, we also found that these ecological interactions change well before species extinctions. Limited animal movement between remaining habitats translates into negative changes in things like eating patterns, which in turn affects the way population sizes change through time and across space. We also found that the specific way in which habitat is destroyed is a key determinant of the community responses to habitat loss. When habitat becomes more fragmented, it makes communities more stable due to a weakening of ecological interactions. But when habitat is lost in adjacent areas – leading to less fragmentation – this makes populations less stable due to stronger species interactions in the remaining suitable area. In fragmented landscapes, predators have a harder time finding prey, which decreases their interactions. Less fragmented landscapes, on the other hand, make predators interact more often with their prey because they are all confined to a reduced area.  By understanding how habitat loss affects interactions between different species in different environments, we can begin to see the true depth of humans’ impact on the natural world. It is not just loss of single species that should be of concern but rather the way that whole communities are affected by human-induced threats. Our findings suggest that biodiversity strategies need to take into account community interactions, as well as the shape of habitat loss, in order to better preserve future biodiversity."
"If you’ve ever forgotten your bag for life at the shop till and had to buy a plastic bag, you may have wondered where that money goes. The carrier bag levy of five pence (5p) was rolled out on October 5 2015 in England. Retailers are expected to donate the proceeds to good causes that would benefit society and the environment, and to report that information to the government. We looked at how the scheme has been implemented since then. The regulation was intended to limit the number of people using single-use plastic carrier bags, so that fewer end up as litter around the UK. These bags can also ensnare and choke wildlife and some species mistake them for food. The ensuing levy has succeeded in curtailing single-use plastic bags – according to government figures, plastic bag sales in Britain’s largest supermarkets were down by 80% three years on. The benefits of the 5p levy are clear, but there’s still the question of where the money goes. The charge isn’t a tax, so the government doesn’t collect it – and can’t dictate where the money goes, so can only recommend shops donate it. While most retailers commit some funds to charitable causes, the amount donated tends to vary. Every retailer has its own policy for managing the levy and can decide how much of the proceeds from it are donated. Retailers must report what they do with the proceeds from the levy, but not how much. And the publication of information on donations is voluntary. Based on data published by the government for 2017-2018, only around 60% of retailers voluntarily gave information on donations they had made to good causes. There is no way to tell what happened to the remaining 40% – it’s possible that some did not donate at all. Several stores discourage people from buying 5p carrier bags in favour of more durable but more expensive options that are re-usable, such as “bags for life”. The more expensive bags are usually prominently displayed at checkouts, while the 5p bags are often just out of sight.  Bags for life aren’t “single-use” in the legislation, so the proceeds from their sales don’t have to be donated to charity. In other words, retailers can consider such sales as an additional source of income. While retailers can encourage shoppers to retain and reuse these bags, there is an opportunity for some to profit from their sale to shoppers who buy a new one each time. This suggests that the main beneficiaries of the carrier bag levy in England may well be the retailers themselves. Very few retailers advise customers that they can get a free replacement for used carrier bags. Customers can bring their old, used carrier bags from a shop and have them exchanged for new ones for free at the same shop. There weren’t signs to convey this to customers in any of the stores that we surveyed. Many shoppers are unaware that they can avoid the 5p charge altogether by exchanging the 5p bags for free when they are worn out. Unfortunately, retailers are doing little to educate their customers on how to recycle the bags. We found that the more expensive the store, the more likely customers will pay for carrier bags rather than reuse old ones, so reducing the number of carrier bags being bought may depend to a certain extent on the value of the goods. Advertising the bag replacement scheme could have more effect, then, in department stores and places selling more expensive goods.

      The 5p carrier bag charge has paved the way for other waste reduction policies


 Prior to the levy, the cost of designing and manufacturing these single-use bags fell directly on the stores, with no profit margin. Now that stores charge customers for single-use bags, the revenue from the sale can provide them with extra resources to invest in the design and quality of reusable bags for life. We found that the design of these reusable bags has considerably improved since the levy came into effect, with more colourful and eye catching designs that carry the logo and name of sponsors. Customers end up carrying these sponsor messages to a broader audience and are inadvertently acting as brand ambassadors for these stores. What we found when we dug into the plastic bag levy suggests it has been managed in a way that can confuse customers and leave them unaware of the levy’s purpose or their option to return used bags. If customers believe their 5p is going to good causes but discover it’s actually going into marketing spend for retailers, they may lose confidence in the scheme. The levy has been a remarkable success so far, it would be a shame for it to let down customers through a lack of accountability and transparency."

Nuclear power plants in Germany: Image via Wikipedia

BBC – 30 May, 2011
Germany pledges to end all nuclear power by 2022
Germany’s ruling coalition says it has agreed a date of 2022 for the shutdown of all of its nuclear power plants.

Environment Minister Norbert Rottgen made the announcement after a meeting of the ruling coalition that lasted into the early hours of Monday.

"While city planners have been encouraged to plant trees and gardens to green the city for the health of its inhabitants, recent research has found that the same trees can damage certain buildings. Our research revealed that chemicals produced by certain species of plants and trees react with common air pollutants to create damaging chemicals that corrode building materials such as stone, concrete, and steel. Especially at risk are heritage buildings which are built of limestone or sandstone. Published in the Science of the Total Environment journal, our study examined the role of “green infrastructure” such as trees and vegetation in towns and cities, something that local authorities have been encouraged to invest in. Urban green areas can reduce greenhouse gases, cut down exposure to pollution for city dwellers, especially those spending time in heavily polluted areas such as cyclists, and provide a mental health boost. Interactions between the chemicals released by plants and building materials have not been studied, so we made our focus. The damage is caused by ground level ozone, formed when the volatile organic compounds given off into the air by plants are broken down in sunlight and react with the common pollutant nitrogen dioxide. Using mathematical simulations, we investigated the effect of green vegetation on the integrity of limestone and steel structures during different seasons. Some species commonly found in cities such as sycamore maple and Douglas fir produce these organic compounds. Urban areas with many of these and similarly active species will therefore have higher concentrations of ground level ozone during summers, and so a relatively larger rate of lime stone deterioration.  The effect of green infrastructure on building materials is not always identical. Each building material has differing resistance or vulnerability to a particular pollutant. For example, limestone, from which buildings such as Houses of Parliament or St Paul’s Cathedral, and Westminster Abbey are constructed, is strongly damaged by increased levels of ground level ozone. Other building materials such as zinc, copper and carbon steel are also affected, both by the levels of air pollutants and the local climatic conditions. Some of the corrosive gases, such as sulphur dioxide, ozone and nitrogen oxides, are particularly aggressive in attacking building materials.  Sulphur dioxide, the active ingredient in acid rain, is no longer a major issue in most of the developed world. But this is only after decades of efforts to reduce sulphur emissions from power stations and factories, and move to low-sulphur fuels. Ozone and nitrogen oxides still remain a challenge. Ground level ozone in the northern hemisphere has almost doubled since the 19th century, with up to two-thirds of these emissions due to burning fossil fuels. In Asia and Latin America nitrogen oxides are increasing due to less stringent environmental regulations. Here, transport emissions account for a large proportion of nitrogen oxides which then contribute to ozone formation.  In contrast, in Europe levels of roadside nitrogen oxides have significantly decreased due to tighter regulations and improving vehicle technology. Even so, the rate of decrease is slower than anticipated. There has been no similar decrease in nitrogen dioxide levels, despite reductions in nitrogen oxides. Consequently high levels of nitrogen dioxide that breach EU limits are found in many urban areas throughout Europe, with serious implications for building integrity, and for public health. Nitrogen dioxide has been linked to adverse respiratory effects, especially in people with asthma. To date, only the positive effects of “greening” the city have been considered, without realising that the vegetation planted could in fact be adding to the problem. The effects that more plants and trees can have on relative humidity and wind in a local area can also act as a catalyst for further deterioration of buildings. Planners may want to realise that planting trees for the benefit of people can have unintended consequences on bridges, buildings and other key infrastructure. But green areas are important, integral parts of towns and cities – it will not do to simply cut them out of the equation. Instead those designing city parks and gardens and other greening improvements should carefully select the species that will produce the least organic compounds, and so limit the damage to buildings around them."
"Nature is sending us a message with the coronavirus pandemic and the ongoing climate crisis, according to the UN’s environment chief, Inger Andersen. Andersen said humanity was placing too many pressures on the natural world with damaging consequences, and warned that failing to take care of the planet meant not taking care of ourselves. Leading scientists also said the Covid-19 outbreak was a “clear warning shot”, given that far more deadly diseases existed in wildlife, and that today’s civilisation was “playing with fire”. They said it was almost always human behaviour that caused diseases to spill over into humans. To prevent further outbreaks, the experts said, both global heating and the destruction of the natural world for farming, mining and housing have to end, as both drive wildlife into contact with people. They also urged authorities to put an end to live animal markets – which they called an “ideal mixing bowl” for disease – and the illegal global animal trade. Andersen, executive director of the UN Environment Programme, said the immediate priority was to protect people from the coronavirus and prevent its spread. “But our long-term response must tackle habitat and biodiversity loss,” she added. “Never before have so many opportunities existed for pathogens to pass from wild and domestic animals to people,” she told the Guardian, explaining that 75% of all emerging infectious diseases come from wildlife. “Our continued erosion of wild spaces has brought us uncomfortably close to animals and plants that harbour diseases that can jump to humans.” She also noted other environmental impacts, such as the Australian bushfires, broken heat records and the worst locust invasion in Kenya for 70 years. “At the end of the day, [with] all of these events, nature is sending us a message,” Anderson said. “There are too many pressures at the same time on our natural systems and something has to give,” she added. “We are intimately interconnected with nature, whether we like it or not. If we don’t take care of nature, we can’t take care of ourselves. And as we hurtle towards a population of 10 billion people on this planet, we need to go into this future armed with nature as our strongest ally.” Human infectious disease outbreaks are rising and in recent years there have been Ebola, bird flu, Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers), Rift Valley fever, severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars), West Nile virus and Zika virus all cross from animals to humans. “The emergence and spread of Covid-19 was not only predictable, it was predicted [in the sense that] there would be another viral emergence from wildlife that would be a public health threat,” said Prof Andrew Cunningham, of the Zoological Society of London. A 2007 study of the 2002-03 Sars outbreak concluded: “The presence of a large reservoir of Sars-CoV-like viruses in horseshoe bats, together with the culture of eating exotic mammals in southern China, is a timebomb.” Cunningham said other diseases from wildlife had much higher fatality rates in people, such as 50% for Ebola and 60%-75% for Nipah virus, transmitted from bats in south Asia. “Although, you might not think it at the moment, we’ve probably got a bit lucky with [Covid-19],” he said. “So I think we should be taking this as a clear warning shot. It’s a throw of the dice.” “It’s almost always a human behaviour that causes it and there will be more in the future unless we change,” said Cunningham. Markets butchering live wild animals from far and wide are the most obvious example, he said. A market in China is believed to have been the source of Covid-19. “The animals have been transported over large distances and are crammed together into cages. They are stressed and immunosuppressed and excreting whatever pathogens they have in them,” he said. “With people in large numbers in the market and in intimate contact with the body fluids of these animals, you have an ideal mixing bowl for [disease] emergence. If you wanted a scenario to maximise the chances of [transmission], I couldn’t think of a much better way of doing it.” China has banned such markets, and Cunningham said this must be permanent. “However, this needs to be done globally. There are wet markets throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa and a lot of other Asian countries too.” The ease of travel in the modern world exacerbates the dangers, he said, adding: “These days, you can be in a central African rainforest one day and in central London the next.” Aaron Bernstein, at the Harvard School of Public Health in the US, said the destruction of natural places drives wildlife to live close to people and that climate change was also forcing animals to move: “That creates an opportunity for pathogens to get into new hosts.” “We’ve had Sars, Mers, Covid-19, HIV. We need to see what nature is trying to tell us here. We need to recognise that we’re playing with fire,” he said. “The separation of health and environmental policy is a ​dangerous delusion. Our health entirely depends on the climate and the other organisms we share the planet with.” The billion-dollar illegal wildlife trade is another part of the problem, said John Scanlon, the former secretary general of the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. “Importing countries should create a new legal obligation, supported by criminal sanctions, for an importer of wildlife to prove that it was legally obtained under the source country’s national laws,” he said. “If we can blend taking a hard line against transnational organised wildlife criminals, while also opening up new opportunities for local communities, then we will see biodiversity, ecosystems and communities thrive.” The Covid-19 crisis may provide an opportunity for change, but Cunningham is not convinced it will be taken: “I thought things would have changed after Sars, which was a massive wake up call – the biggest economic impact of any emerging disease to that date,” he said. “Everybody was up in arms about it. But it went away, because of our control measures. Then there was a huge sigh of relief and it was back to business as usual. We cannot go back to business as usual.” • This article was amended on 27 March 2020. An earlier version incorrectly gave the full name of Sars as sudden acute respiratory syndrome; it is severe acute respiratory syndrome."
"You may have seen a variant of this meme before. A map of North Africa is shown, with a surprisingly small box somewhere in Libya or Algeria shaded in. An area of the Sahara this size, the caption will say, could power the entire world through solar energy: Over the years various different schemes have been proposed for making this idea a reality. Though a company called Desertec caused a splash with some bold ideas a decade ago, it collapsed in 2014 and none of the other proposals to export serious amounts of electricity from the Sahara to Europe and beyond are anywhere close to being realised.  It’s still hard to store and transport that much electricity from such a remote place, for one thing, while those people who do live in the Sahara may object to their homeland being transformed into a solar superpower. In any case, turning one particular region into a global energy hub risks all sorts of geopolitical problems.  The Imagine newsletter aims to tackle these big “what if” questions, so we asked a number of academics to weigh in on the challenges of exploiting the cheapest form of electricity from perhaps the cheapest and best spot on Earth.  What is Imagine? Imagine is a newsletter from The Conversation that presents a vision of a world acting on climate change. Drawing on the collective wisdom of academics in fields from anthropology and zoology to technology and psychology, it investigates the many ways life on Earth could be made fairer and more fulfilling by taking radical action on climate change.

Amin Al-Habaibeh is an engineer at Nottingham Trent University who has researched various options for Saharan solar.

      Should we turn the Sahara Desert into a huge solar farm?


 He points to the sheer size and amount of sunshine the Sahara desert receives: It’s larger than Brazil, and slightly smaller than the US. If every drop of sunshine that hits the Sahara was converted into energy, the desert would produce enough electricity over any given period to power Europe 7,000 times over. So even a small chunk of the desert could indeed power much of the world, in theory. But how would this be achieved?  Al-Habaibeh points to two main technologies. Both have their pros and cons. Concentrated solar power uses lenses or mirrors to focus the sun’s energy in one spot, which becomes incredibly hot. This heat then generates electricity through a steam turbine.  In this image the tower in the middle is the “receiver” which then feeds heat to a generator: Some systems store the heat in the form of molten salt. This means they can release energy overnight, when the sun isn’t shining, providing a 24h supply of electricity. Concentrated solar power is very efficient in hot, dry environments, but the steam generators use lots of water. Then there are regular photovoltaic solar panels. These are much more flexible and easier to set up, but less efficient in the very hottest weather. Overall, Al-Habaibeh is positive: Just a small portion of the Sahara could produce as much energy as the entire continent of Africa does at present. As solar technology improves, things will only get cheaper and more efficient. The Sahara may be inhospitable for most plants and animals, but it could bring sustainable energy to life across North Africa – and beyond. Installing mass amounts of solar panels in the Sahara could also have a remarkable impact on the desert itself. The Sahara hasn’t always been dry and sandy. Indeed, archaeologists have found traces of human societies in the middle of the desert, along with prehistoric cave paintings of Savannah animals. Along with climate records, this suggests that just a few thousand years ago the “desert” was far greener than today. Alona Armstrong, an environmental science lecturer at Lancaster University, wrote about a fascinating study in 2018 that suggested massive renewable energy farms could make the Sahara green again.

      Massive solar and wind farms could bring vegetation back to the Sahara


 A team of scientists imagined building truly vast solar and wind farms, far larger than most countries, and simulated the impact they would have on the desert around them. They found that: This may be a nice side effect of a huge Saharan solar plant, but it doesn’t necessarily mean it should happen. As Armstrong points out: These areas may be sparsely populated but people do live there, their livelihoods are there, and the landscapes are of cultural value to them. Can the land really be “grabbed” to supply energy to Europe and the Middle East? If we want to deploy millions of solar panels in the Sahara, then who is “we”? Who pays for it, who runs it and, crucially, who gets the cheap electricity? This is what worries Olúfẹ́mi Táíwò, a philosopher who researches climate justice at Georgetown University. He mentions Saharan solar power as one of the possible policies involved in a Green New Deal, a wide-ranging plan to enact a “green transition” over the next decade.

      How a Green New Deal could exploit developing countries


 He points out that exports of solar power could: “Exacerbate what scholars like sociologist Doreen Martinez call climate colonialism – the domination of less powerful countries and peoples through initiatives meant to slow the pace of global warming.” All of this will be moot if Saharan solar never actually happens. And Denes Csala, a lecturer in energy systems at Lancaster University, is sceptical.

      Why the new 'solar superpowers' will probably be petro-states in the Gulf


 It’s true that much of the world’s best solar resources are found in the desert. Here’s a graph from his PhD research which shows how Saharan nations dominate: But Denes says that we’re looking at the wrong desert. In fact, the countries of the Arabian peninsula are better placed to exploit the sun. He argues several factors work in favour of Saudi Arabia, the UAE and co: [Energy security] would be the Achilles heel of a northern African energy project: the connections to Europe would likely be the continent’s single most important critical infrastructure and, considering the stability of the region, it is unlikely that European countries would take on such a risk. It would be fair to say academics have mixed views about the idea of mass Saharan solar. While the energy potential is obvious, and most of the necessary technology already exists, in the long run it may prove too complicated politically. Maybe Europeans should look closer to home. The UK Planning Inspectorate is currently examining the Cleve Hill solar farm proposal in Kent, which would involve installing nearly a million solar panels across a marshland site the size of 600 football pitches. To protect against flooding, the panels would be mounted several metres in the air. If built, despite opposition from locals and conservationists, Cleve Hill would be by far the country’s largest solar farm and about the same size as Europe’s largest, near Bordeaux.   Alastair Buckley from the University of Sheffield points out the project would be groundbreaking as, unlike other ventures of this kind, it doesn’t rely on subsidies. With solar power getting ever cheaper, Cleve Hill – if it happens – seems to mark the moment when solar may start paying for itself – even far from the world’s deserts.

"As the climate crisis grows ever more urgent, fossil fuels are becoming an increasingly unattractive proposition. For the US, which is doubling down on its natural gas infrastructure, that’s a problem. The country wants to increase exports of its home-brewed gas. What better way than to rebrand it as the “freedom gas” and “molecules of US freedom” that uphold the country’s commitment to clean energy? Right? The Trump White House’s weaponising of words has won his administration many linguistic battles. And in terms of attracting attention, this latest generous wordplay has certainly worked a charm. An otherwise humdrum announcement of the expansion of a natural gas plant in Texas has now made international news. But when the headlines have blown away, this liberty-tinged marketing ploy is likely to fall flat. Marketing is, in a nutshell, the manipulation of consumers. Purchase that experience and you will seem like a more interesting person. Buy this gas and you’ll be supporting freedom. In a fossil fuel market recently dominated by countries with questionable reputations on human rights, perhaps the US Department of Energy’s announcement aimed to raise awareness among prospective foreign buyers that oil and gas made in the land of freedom and opportunity is now a considerable market force. Russia and the US are currently battling over Europe’s gas market, and civil liberties are not exactly the former’s USP within the region.  The rebranding is also a timely reminder of the US’s continued economic clout and geo-political power. This gas is explicitly for allies, at a time when trade tensions with China are pushing businesses and nations to choose sides.   But marketing only succeeds if it is not too obvious. Subtle “freedom gas” is not. Funnily enough, people don’t like to think that they are being manipulated. We know magic shows are smoke and mirrors, but with skillful sleight of hand and hidden contraptions, a magician can suspend our disbelief and sell us a good time. The same is true of marketing. A car advert overtly selling the freedom of the open road would be likely to cause little other than ire in consumers who know full well that most of their time will be spent in traffic or driving to the supermarket. Instead, subtle but consistent scenes of picturesque mountain roads and country lanes slowly associate the emotions of freedom with the car that manufacturers want us to buy.

      The US natural gas industry is leaking way more methane than previously thought. Here’s why that matters


 Many potential buyers will find the gaseous aroma of American liberty particularly pungent. To those with a dim view of the country’s consistent overseas interference, the rebranding will whiff of the worst of American hubris. China, for example, is turning to Qatar – a major competitor to the US – for sizeable new natural gas imports that are forecast to be big business. In the context of the escalating US-China trade war, such language is especially unlikely to bring the US further custom. Perhaps, then, this is an emotional appeal to a domestic audience, in homage to the “freedom fries” that marketised support for the invasion of Iraq against the backdrop of France’s opposition. Like US intervention, climate breakdown is certainly a polarising issue for the US electorate. Republicans are far less likely to care about the climate crisis than the US population overall.

      Methane is a potent pollutant – let's keep it out of the atmosphere


 But while molecules of freedom might appeal to a loyal voter base, the Trump administration would do well not to overestimate its size when playing with climate rhetoric. Concern over the climate crisis has never been higher, and even a majority of Republicans now support action on climate change. Only half of them support drilling for oil in the Alaskan arctic. It’s worth remembering that the Frenchness of fries was quietly reinstated after it became clear that support for the Iraq war had dwindled and that most people thought the rebranding was “silly”. The freedom of future generations to enjoy a climatically stable planet is now a mainstream concern, as demonstrated by the chorus of sarcastic reaction to freedom molecules on social media. The attempt to dress up natural gas as a clean energy source – a claim that the evidence does not support – may be a nod to the increasingly unavoidable reality of the climate emergency. But history teaches us that making misleading claims can be highly damaging to a brand.  In 1970, a time when US concern over air pollution was high, Standard Oil introduced a new premium petrol in California that was claimed to reduce emissions. Initially, it took off. But when emissions claims were later rejected as false, customers felt betrayed and the brand rapidly fell from favour. The misleading claims leading up to the 2003 invasion of oil-rich Iraq have tarnished a swathe of US politicians and tarred relationships with allies ever since.  The climate crisis will only become more urgent. Attempts to dress up environmentally damaging products as clean are highly likely to come back to haunt future politicians with similar ideologies. Rather than helping US Republicans to “spread freedom gas throughout the world”, provocative marketing ploys like this one may leave the party’s domestic and global influence evaporating as quickly as the fuel it sells."
"**A landlord from North Somerset who is unable to open his pub due to Covid-19 restrictions next week, says he feels ""victimised by post code"".**
John Hayes' pub the Old Inn, Hutton, is in tier three meaning he is not permitted to open when the national lockdown ends next Wednesday.
He said the location of his ""countryside"" pub was different to Bristol and should be allowed to open.
""Somewhere along the line we've been sold down the river,"" he said.
Hutton is some 20 miles (32km) outside of Bristol, and is close to Weston-super-Mare.
The government announced on Thursday that North Somerset would be grouped in tier three \- very high alert, along with Bristol and South Gloucestershire.
""It seems that anywhere associated with Bristol has come under tier three and I don't think our part of the world is the same,"" said Mr Hayes.
""We're not Bristol, we're in the countryside. Nobody has checked where we are, we've been victimised by post code. Tier three is just as bad as the original lockdown, it gives us nothing.""
He also warned that he expected lots of people to visit pubs in BANES, just a short drive away, which will be under lighter tier two restrictions and can open next week.
""Three miles down the road you can go into Sedgemoor [in Somerset] and get a drink,"" Mr Hayes added.
Bath and North East Somerset joins the vast majority of the south west in tier two, which leader of BANES council Dine Romero has welcomed but West of England mayor Tim Bowles said he felt it would have been ""wise"" to have a similar tier level for the whole region.
MP for North Somerset Liam Fox and Weston-super-Mare MP John Penrose issued a joint statement, saying the decision to put North Somerset in tier three ""isn't right or fair"" and called it ""illogical"".
North Somerset's director of public health Matt Lenny said: ""Although cases are falling we are still at a relatively high rate of over 200 per 100,000 people.
""I want to say thank you to everyone for all the hard work but we don't want to lose the momentum. We have to go again and redouble our efforts.""

"It was bats. Or pangolins. To hear common narratives about the origins of Covid-19, there is a simple causal relationship between China’s consumption of wild animals and the coronavirus ravaging the globe. Dr Anthony Fauci, the United States’ top epidemiologist, told Fox: “It boggles my mind how when we have so many diseases that emanate out of that unusual human-animal interface, that we don’t just shut it down.” His opinion echoes a growing chorus across the political spectrum that singles out China’s so-called “wet markets” as the culprit for the pandemic. The Republican senator Lindsey Graham has called the Chinese exotic animal trade “disgusting” and conservationist Jane Goodall has called for “a global ban”.  Science and political economy, however, tell a more complex story. The principal driver of zoonotic diseases (such as the virus Sars-Cov-2, which spread from animals to humans) is industrial animal agriculture. When food production encroaches on wild habitats, it creates opportunities for pathogens to jump to livestock and humans. Industrial agriculture also breeds its own diseases, like swine flu and avian flu, on hellish factory farms. And it contributes to antibiotic resistance and climate change, both of which exacerbate the problem. We need to have an honest public discussion on how to produce our food. Individually, we must stop eating animal products. Collectively, we must transform the global food system and work toward ending animal agriculture and rewilding much of the world. Oddly, many people who would never challenge the reality of climate change refuse to acknowledge the role meat-eating plays in endangering public health. Eating meat, it seems, is a socially acceptable form of science denial. Researchers have long issued warnings about the consequences of our livestock-dominated food system. After the Sars outbreak in 2003, an essay in the American Journal of Public Health lamented that “changing the way humans treat animals – most basically, ceasing to eat them or, at the very least, radically limiting the quantity of them that are eaten – is largely off the radar as a significant preventive measure.” In 2016, the UN Environment Program warned that the “livestock revolution” was a zoonotic disaster waiting to happen. Yet meat consumption continues to rise. Now, just as experts predicted, eating animals is coming back to bite us. Xenophobes call Covid-19 the “Wuhan virus”, but in reality zoonoses emerge worldwide, and do so with increasing regularity. The 1918 “Spanish flu” probably came from a midwestern pig farm. In the 1990s, ecological destabilization in the US south-west led to the Four Corners hantavirus outbreak. The Hendra and Menangle viruses are named after Australian towns. The Reston virus is an Ebola strain named after a DC suburb. Marburg virus emerged in Germany. These last two diseases sprang from monkeys imported for laboratory use – the Chinese are not the only ones with a large and dangerous wildlife trade. Sars, Mers and Zika are only three of many novel zoonoses to strike in the new millennium. Fauci, Graham and Goodall’s call for a clampdown on the “exotic” animal trade is a valid demand, but ignores how that industry is inextricably intertwined with “conventional” food production. The Chinese government has encouraged smallholders to breed and procure wild game to compensate for losing market-share to large livestock firms. Similarly, reliance on “bush meat” in west Africa increased after local fishers were pushed out of coastal waters by foreign trawlers in the 1970s, leading to the outbreaks of HIV and Ebola. The problem isn’t some people’s taste for seemingly strange delicacies, but rather our global, profit-driven, meat-centered food system. Just as zoonotic threats are multiplying, combating them is becoming harder. Antibiotics are increasingly ineffective in part because commercial livestock farmers abuse them, hoping to speed up growth rates or as a prophylactic measure against the spread of disease on overcrowded factory farms. Overuse of antibiotics spurs the evolution of “super-bugs” like MRSA, a flesh-eating bacterium now found at hospitals worldwide. Modern solutions, like viral cures and vaccines, are elusive. The World Health Organization reported that the most important techniques for controlling the 2003 Sars outbreak were not cutting-edge medicines so much as “19th-century public health strategies of contact tracing, quarantine, and isolation”. This has also been the case with Covid-19. Our short-term priority is the development of a vaccine for Covid-19. But we must also start thinking about more radical measures to address the roots of this crisis. We need a more resilient food system that puts less stress on the planet and on public health. This requires three interventions. The first is ending subsidies to industrial animal agriculture and taxing animal products to incorporate the cost of environmental and public health externalities, with the aim of the industry’s eventual abolition. The second is support for local, sustainable plant farming to replace the monocrop-focused status quo. We must relieve pressure on soil and wildlife while creating better, safer agricultural jobs. (We should also remember that meatpacking workers, like their peers in wet markets, tend to be the first exposed to new pathogens.) The third is large-scale, public-directed investment in both plant-based meat alternatives and cellular agriculture (ie, growing animal tissue from stem cells), which would expand scientific research and employment while spurring a transition to animal-free protein. The post-meat age will be a healthier one. Between farming, ranching and feed crops, the livestock industry gobbles up 40% of the world’s habitable surface. A vegan food system would require a tenth as much land. Restoring the natural environment could also create jobs through a public works program akin to the New Deal’s Civilian Conservation Corps. And it would reduce the outbreak of new epidemics by reducing contact between humans and wild animals and by restoring biodiversity. Old habits can change. In the last few weeks, as the coronavirus has spread and millions shelter in place, bean sales have surged. People, it seems, are willing to eat legumes if it’s part of a public health effort. When this pandemic ends they’ll need to keep doing just that, lest a more lethal disaster comes to pass.

"**When Paula-Jayne Tate won a competition for her family to visit Santa Claus in a County Donegal village, she screamed with joy.**
The mother-of-four was particularly delighted for her five-year-old daughter, Kaidence, who was born with spina bifida and hydrocephalus, a condition that causes a build-up of fluid in the brain.
She said meeting Father Christmas would have been a ""magical"" end to a terrible year for Kaidence, who is recovering from multiple brain surgeries.
But their visit has been cancelled due to the two-week period of tougher Covid-19 lockdown measures introduced on Friday.
The Tates, from Newtownabbey, County Antrim, are among many families across Northern Ireland who have had to rethink their annual visits to visit Santa this Christmas due to the pandemic.
Kaidence, who has been shielding with her family since March, also missed last year's festivities due to illness, her mother said.
""It has been a very difficult year and planning to see Santa meant the world to us,"" said Paula-Jayne.
""We have not had any celebrations at all this year - no birthday, Easter or Halloween parties - so seeing Santa would have been magical.
""The timing was also good because Kaidence is doing so well at the moment.
""It would have been the perfect end to a terrible year with the hope that 2021 will bring more positivity.""
Paula-Jayne said the family hoped to organise a telephone call from Santa in place of their usual visit to the grotto.
Pat Doherty, from Donegal's Lapland in Ballyliffin, said it was difficult to let families like the Tates down.
In the past, he said they had catered for up to 17,000 visitors, but had only accepted 3,000 bookings this year due to Covid-19.
""Our bookings start to come in in August and by September this year we stopped taking new bookings because of the way things were going [with the virus] in Donegal,"" he said.
November bookings had been cancelled due to restrictions in the Republic of Ireland, while Stormont's restrictions have hit December bookings as most visitors to Ballyliffin Lapland travel from Northern Ireland, said Mr Doherty.
""We spent a month building and planning the village, and we were ready to go.
""We are waiting to see what happens next. There is nothing else we can do.""
Claudine Owens, who has five children, had been looking forward to meeting Santa in a rural cottage which has also been shut down.
Mrs Owens, from Seaforde, County Down, is disappointed they will have to forego many of their family traditions this year.
""I felt like it would be something normal and exciting after a hard year,"" she said.
""Visits to Santa are special. I keep all the photographs of our visits every year in a box, so it is sad.
""But it has also made me realise how fortunate we have been in other years to do all the lovely things we do before Christmas.""
Hugh Black, manager of the Tower Centre, Ballymena, said the shopping centre's Santa grotto had not been able to open yet due to restrictions on indoor visitor attractions.
""We had 5,500 children through the grotto last year,"" he said. ""That is how many disappointed families we will have if it can't go ahead at all.
""It is a huge deal.""
Mr Black remained optimistic the centre would be able to open the grotto if restrictions on non-essential services are lifted as planned on 11 December.
In the meantime, Father Christmas is reading children's stories in weekly videos posted on the centre's social media platforms, which Mr Black said gave children ""a chance to see Santa in their homes"".
Garden centre owner Robin Mercer said he was disappointed to cancel the visits of hundreds of families who had booked appointments with Santa during this two-week circuit breaker.
Hillmount Garden Centre's grotto had been adapted to enable social distancing, including larger rooms, a booking system and temperature testing, said Mr Mercer.
""It is a big responsibility to host Santa, we feel like we are letting families down, even if it is out of our control,"" he said.
""It's not just for ourselves, it's for all the other places that do Santa's grottos.""
Mr Mercer said he remained hopeful there would be some easing of restrictions after the circuit-breaker, allowing at least some hopeful children to get their wish of seeing Santa this year.
However, one thing is for certain, some children may not be able to visit Santa this year, but he will still be leaving presents under the tree on 25 December."

Regular readers may recall that back on June 15th, I pointed out the absurdity of this “Row to the Pole” publicity stunt sponsored by the whisky company “Old Pulteney” which had plans to row to the North Magnetic Pole (based on the 1996 location) and along the way take some temperature, water, and ice samples along the way in the guise of a science expedition.

Only problem was, the North Magnetic Pole is far into the Arctic sea now, and ice locked. The destination they chose for “Row to the Pole” hasn’t been the location of the North Magnetic Pole for 15 years, as I illustrated below, they’ll fall about 738 km/458 miles short of the North Magnetic Pole due to a drift of about 41km/year:

Undeterred by this complication, the group of rowers has set off anyway, and made some good progress according to their Facebook page, covering 40 kilometers on the first day. They even offer a satellite tracking page to watch the progress.
Too bad though they have not checked the latest satellite images from NASA’s AQUA Modis RAPIDFIRE page. I did, and it looks like the expedition is going to hit a wall of ice soon.
Here’s the area I chose to look at today from this NASA image link=>
I rotated/cropped, plotted the approximate proposed path, and annotated the image from NASA to help readers see what the Row to the Pole people are soon going to run into in a couple of days:


Note the patch of white in the red box that the planned rowing path transects. Are those clouds or ice? The magnified view area gives the answer below.
Click for a full sized hi-resolution image
Yup, unless those guys in the rowboat have an icebreaker leading the way, or there’s an “instamelt” de-icing ahead of them, they likely aren’t going anywhere near the old North Magnetic Pole circa 1996, much less the actual one.
Looks like “Scotch on the Rocks” for them.
However, like any good publicity stunt, they’ll probably figure out some way to make a success out of it, perhaps declaring that “important though incomplete science has been done”.

"I see a lot of resources talking about near-term human extinction, or the fact that thanks to climate change my generation will see the end of humanity. How likely is an outcome like this? Is there any hope for our futures? Anonymous, aged 18. London, UK. This article is part of I Need To Know, a Q&A service for teenagers by The Conversation.  The claim that humanity only has just over a decade left due to climate change is based on a misunderstanding. In 2018, a fairly difficult-to-read report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned that humanity needs to cut its carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions in half by 2030, to avoid global warming of 1.5°C above the levels seen before the industrial revolution.  What this actually means is roughly, “We have about 12 years before fixing climate change becomes really expensive and tough.”  Humanity can still live in a world with climate change – it’s just going to be more work, and many lives and livelihoods are likely to be threatened. But it’s complicated, because this century we are facing many problems at the same time, and we are more dependent on each other than ever.  To get our food, most of us humans depend on global transport, payment and logistics systems. These, in turn, require fuel, electricity, communications and a lot of other things to work properly.  All these systems are connected to each other, so if one starts crashing, the chaos may cause other systems to crash, and before we know it we’ll have massive shortages and conflicts.  It’s hard to calculate the exact risk of this happening, since it has never happened before. Until recently, the world was split into separate regions that were largely independent of each other.  But we do know that climate change puts the whole world under pressure – everywhere, at the same time – making the risk of these systems collapsing more serious.  For example, it’s easier for businesses to handle cybersecurity and energy supply when they don’t also have to cope with natural hazards. Likewise, it’s difficult for governments to maintain infrastructure when politicians are busy dealing with the public’s reactions to food prices, refugees and ecological crises.  Geoengineering to reduce the impact of climate change – for example, by reducing CO₂ levels or pumping reflective particles into the Earth’s atmosphere to deflect the sun’s rays – might work. But if disaster strikes and those operations stop, the effects of climate change can return quickly. 


      Read more:
      Time is running out on climate change, but geoengineering has dangers of its own


 The reasonable thing to do is to work on making our systems more resilient – and there are plenty of opportunities to do this. In practice, this means more local energy production, better backup systems, work on reducing climate change, and being more willing to pay extra for safety.  So what about the other threats humanity is facing? Though natural hazards such as earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanoes and hurricanes can be disastrous, they pose a comparatively small threat to the survival of the human race.  Hazards big enough to cause entire species to go extinct are relatively rare. The typical mammalian species survives for about a million years, so the risk is roughly one in a million per year.
Asteroid impacts and supervolcanos do happen, but they are rare enough that we do not have to worry about them. Even so, planning for the day when we need to deflect an asteroid or make do without agriculture for a decade is a smart move. Pandemics are worse. We know the 1918 flu killed tens of millions of people worldwide. New influenza viruses are popping up all the time, and we should expect to see a big pandemic at least once every 100 years.  Over the past century, we have become better at medicine (which lowers the risk from disease) but we also travel more (which increases the spread of diseases). Natural pandemics are unlikely to wipe out the human race, since there is almost always somebody who is immune. But a bad pandemic might still wreck our global society. Bioweapons, which use bacteria, viruses or fungi to harm humans or agriculture, are another issue. Fortunately, they have rarely been used in war, but they might become more dangerous in the near future because advances in biotechnology are making it easier and cheaper to modify organisms and automate lab work.  As this technology becomes more accessible, there’s a growing risk it could be used as a “doomsday device” by nasty regimes, to deter other states from seeking to topple them. Right now, the risk is smallish, but it will surely become larger if we do not figure out better ways to detect pathogens early on, keep an eye on risky biotechnology and do diligent diplomacy to keep governments sane.  Perhaps the biggest risk to humanity right now is nuclear weapons. I would personally guess the risk of a nuclear war (not necessarily world-ending but still horrifying) to be somewhere between one in 100 and one in 1,000 per year. This risk goes up or down, depending on tensions between countries and the competence of the people handling early warning systems. At the Future of Humanity Institute at the University of Oxford, we do a lot of work on Artificial Intelligence (AI). As with biotechnology, the risk right now is pretty minimal, but it might grow in time as AI become better and smarter, and we think it’s better to be safe than sorry.  Developing tools to ensure AI stays safe and operates in a way that benefits humanity could save money in the long run, and it’s unlikely to make things worse. Again, the probability of an AI disaster is fairly undefined, since it changes depending on how well we prepare for it.  I can’t give a probability of a world-ending disaster that isn’t more or less guesswork. But I do think there’s a big enough risk of such a disaster in our lifetimes that we should work hard to fix the world – whether by making sure governments and AI stay safe and sane, replacing fossil fuels, building backup systems and plans, decentralising key systems and so on. These things are worthwhile, even if the risk is one in a million: the world is precious, and the future we are risking is vast. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter.

Guest Post by Willis Eschenbach
Loehle and Scafetta recently posted a piece on decomposing the HadCRUT3 temperature record into a couple of component cycles plus a trend. I disagreed with their analysis on a variety of grounds. In the process, I was reminded of work I had done a few years ago using what is called “Periodicity Analysis” (PDF).
A couple of centuries ago, a gentleman named Fourier showed that any signal could be uniquely decomposed into a number of sine waves with different periods. Fourier analysis has been a mainstay analytical tool since that time. It allows us to detect any underlying regular sinusoidal cycles in a chaotic signal.
Figure 1. Joseph Fourier, looking like the world’s happiest mathematician
While Fourier analysis is very useful, it has a few shortcomings. First, it can only extract sinusoidal signals. Second, although it has good resolution as short timescales, it has poor resolution at the longer timescales. For many kinds of cyclical analysis, I prefer periodicity analysis.
So how does periodicity analysis work? The citation above gives a very technical description of the process, and it’s where I learned how to do periodicity analysis. Let me attempt to give a simpler description, although I recommend the citation for mathematicians.

Periodicity analysis breaks down a signal into cycles, but not sinusoidal cycles. It does so by directly averaging the data itself, so that it shows the actual cycles rather than theoretical cycles.
For example, suppose that we want to find the actual cycle of length two in a given dataset. We can do it by numbering the data points in order, and then dividing them into odd- and even-numbered data points. If we average all of the odd data points, and we average all of the even data, it will give us the average cycle of length two in the data. Here is what we get when we apply that procedure to the HadCRUT3 dataset:
Figure 2. Periodicity in the HadCRUT3 global surface temperature dataset, with a cycle length of 2. The cycle has been extended to be as long as the original dataset.
As you might imagine for a cycle of length 2, it is a simple zigzag. The amplitude is quite small, only plus/minus a hundredth of a degree. So we can conclude that there is only a tiny cycle of length two in the HadCRUT3.
Next, here is the same analysis, but with a cycle length of four. To do the analysis, we number the dataset in order with a cycle of four, i.e. “1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4 …”
Then we average all the “ones” together, and all of the twos and the threes and the fours. When we plot these out, we see the following pattern:
Figure 3. Periodicity in the HadCRUT3 global surface temperature dataset, with a cycle length of 4. The cycle has been extended to be as long as the original dataset.
As I mentioned above, we are not reducing the dataset to sinusoidal (sine wave shaped) cycles. Instead, we are determining the actual cycles in the dataset. This becomes more evident when we look at say the twenty year cycle:
Figure 4. Periodicity in the HadCRUT3 dataset, with a cycle length of 20. The cycle has been extended to be as long as the original dataset.
Note that the actual 20 year cycle is not sinusoidal. Instead, it rises quite sharply, and then decays slowly.
Now, as you can see from the three examples above, the amplitudes of the various length cycles are quite different. If we set the mean (average) of the original data to zero, we can measure the power in the cyclical underlying signals as the sum of the absolute values of the signal data. It is useful to compare this power value to the total power in the original signal. If we do this at all possible frequencies, we get a graph of the strength of each of the underlying cycles.
For example, suppose we are looking at a simple sine wave with a period of 24 years. Figure 5 shows the sine wave, along with periodicity analysis in blue showing the power in each of the various length cycles:
Figure 5. A sine wave, along with the periodicity analysis of all cycles up to half the length of the dataset.
Looking at Figure 5, we can see one clear difference between Fourier analysis and periodicity analysis — the periodicity analysis shows peaks at 24, 48, and 72 years, while a Fourier analysis of the same data would only show the 24-year cycle. Of course, the apparent 48 and 72 year peaks are merely a result of the 24 year cycle. Note also that the shortest length peak (24 years) is sharper than the longest length (72-year) peak. This is because there are fewer data points to measure and average when we are dealing with longer time spans, so the sharp peaks tend to broaden with increasing cycle length.
To move to a more interesting example relevant to the Loehle/Scafetta paper, consider the barycentric cycle of the sun. The sun rotates around the center of mass of the solar system. As it rotates, it speeds up and slows down because of the varying pull of the planets. What are the underlying cycles?
We can use periodicity analysis to find the cycles that have the most effect on the barycentric velocity. Figure 6 shows the process, step by step:
Figure 6. Periodicity analysis of the annual barycentric velocity data. 
The top row shows the barycentric data on the left, along with the amount of power in cycles of various lengths on the right in blue. The periodicity diagram at the top right shows that the overwhelming majority of the power in the barycentric data comes from a ~20 year cycle. It also demonstrates what we saw above, the spreading of the peaks of the signal at longer time periods because of the decreasing amount of data.
The second row left panel shows the signal that is left once we subtract out the 20-year cycle from the barycentric data. The periodicity diagram on the second row right shows that after we remove the 20-year cycle, the maximum amount of power is in the 83 year cycle. So as before, we remove that 83-year cycle.
Once that is done, the third row right panel shows that there is a clear 19-year cycle (visible as peaks at 19, 38, 57, and 76 years. This cycle may be a result of the fact that the “20-year cycle” is actually slightly less than 20 years). When that 19-year cycle is removed, there is a 13-year cycle visible at 13, 26, 39 years etc. And once that 13-year cycle is removed … well, there’s not much left at all.
The bottom left panel shows the original barycentric data in black, and the reconstruction made by adding just these four cycles of different lengths is shown in blue. As you can see, these four cycles are sufficient to reconstruct the barycentric data quite closely. This shows that we’ve done a valid deconstruction of the original data.
Now, what does all of this have to do with the Loehle/Scafetta paper? Well, two things. First, in the discussion on that thread I had said that I thought that the 60 year cycle that Loehle/Scafetta said was in the barycentric data was very weak. As the analysis above shows, the barycentric data does not have any kind of strong 60-year underlying cycle. Loehle/Scafetta claimed that there were ~ 20-year and ~ 60-year cycles in both the solar barycentric data and the surface temperature data. I find no such 60-year cycle in the barycentric data.
However, that’s not what I set out to investigate. I started all of this because I thought that the analysis of random red-noise datasets might show spurious cycles. So I made up some random red-noise datasets the same length as the HadCRUT3 annual temperature records (158 years), and I checked to see if they contained what look like cycles.
A “red-noise” dataset is one which is “auto-correlated”. In a temperature dataset, auto-correlated means that todays temperature depends in part on yesterday’s temperature. One kind of red-noise data is created by what are called “ARMA” processes. “AR” stands for “auto-regressive”, and “MA” stands for “moving average”. This kind of random noise is very similar observational datasets such as the HadCRUT3 dataset.
So, I made up a couple dozen random ARMA “pseudo-temperature” datasets using the AR and MA values calculated from the HadCRUT3 dataset, and I ran a periodicity analysis on each of the pseudo-temperature datasets to see what kinds of cycles they contained. Figure 6 shows eight of the two dozen random pseudo-temperature datasets in black, along with the corresponding periodicity analysis of the power in various cycles in blue to the right of the graph of the dataset:
Figure 6. Pseudo-temperature datasets (black lines) and their associated periodicity (blue circles). All pseudo-temperature datasets have been detrended.
Note that all of these pseudo-temperature datasets have some kind of apparent underlying cycles, as shown by the peaks in the periodicity analyses in blue on the right. But because they are purely random data, these are only pseudo-cycles, not real underlying cycles. Despite being clearly visible in the data and in the periodicity analyses, the cycles are an artifact of the auto-correlation of the datasets.
So for example random set 1 shows a strong cycle of about 42 years. Random set 6 shows two strong cycles, of about 38 and 65 years. Random set 17 shows a strong ~ 45-year cycle, and a weaker cycle around 20 years or so. We see this same pattern in all eight of the pseudo-temperature datasets, with random set 20 having cycles at 22 and 44 years, and random set 21 having a 60-year cycle and weak smaller cycles.
That is the main problem with the Loehle/Scafetta paper. While they do in fact find cycles in the HadCRUT3 data, the cycles are neither stronger nor more apparent than the cycles in the random datasets above. In other words, there is no indication at all that the HadCRUT3 dataset has any kind of significant multi-decadal cycles.
How do I know that?
Well, one of the datasets shown in Figure 6 above is actually not a random dataset. It is the HadCRUT3 surface temperature dataset itself … and it is indistinguishable from the truly random datasets in terms of its underlying cycles. All of them have visible cycles, it’s true, in some cases strong cycles … but they don’t mean anything.

I have two new (well one and a half, rounded up) pages to announce for WUWT readers.
First, we have the new Atmospheric Reference Page, available on the pulldown menu as seen below: 

The Atmospheric Reference Page is also available on the right sidebar with this icon:

Thanks to WUWT regular “Just The Facts” for compiling and developing this page.
In the coming  weeks we are planning to develop additional Reference Pages and to refine the  existing pages further, so please post any links below that you think might be  valuable additions to WUWT’s Reference Pages.
Second, we have the “sorta-new” upgraded Test page, also available from the menu bar.
The purpose of this page is to give WUWT commenters a place to practice complex comments that might need formatting, I’ve added the helpful tips from Ric Werme to this page to give a reference to use for formatting comments.
Unfortunately no, wordpress.com where WUWT is hosted still hasn’t provided a live comment preview function, I’ve asked wp.com support for this many times, but to no avail. But we do have a solution, read on.
The only solution to actually embed a preview function in the WUWT website is to go to self hosting and manage wordpress in a LAMP installation on a server myself, and given the volume of traffic WUWT gets, plus what we learned trying to do just that with climateaudit.org when news breaks (so did the server box) I don’t want to risk it. Cloudservers at wordpress.com handle such loads with ease. Both WUWT and Climate Audit are stable and can handle huge loads, so I don’t plan to fix what isn’t broken.
You can however use Firefox and Greasemonkey to edit and preview some comment functions, see the link in the Test page. Combine Greasemonkey with the CA Assistant (developed for Climate Audit by Mr. Pete) and you have a way to fully preview and edit comments prior to submitting – see details here
If anyone has any other suggestions for browser add-ons please leave a comment below.

Share this...FacebookTwitterEvery good manager knows that economic success and environmental protection only get achieved when resources are used efficiently and wisely. It makes little sense to buy a huge machine that can run only 20% of the time when you can get the job done using a much smaller machine that runs 100% all the time.

Capacity utilization (economic efficiency) of the energy feed-in power production systems in percent. Data source: http://goo.gl/GqJuy. Chart source: Wilfried Heck/. 
Biomasse – biomass
 Wasserkraft – hydro
 EEG-Erzeugung – all combined
 biogener Abfall – bio-waste
 Windkraft – wind power
As the graphic above from Winfried Heck’s website shows, Germany’s overall green power efficiency, depicted by the bold “EEG-Erzeugung” curve, is approaching only 20%.
In the early 90s, biomass and hydro were the bulk of Germany’s renewable energy, and so the overall capacity utilization of its green energy back then was close to 50%. But massive subsidies lead to the large-scale installation of the far less efficient wind power and photovoltaic systems, which today are Germany’s main producers of green energy, overshadowing hydro and biomass. Thus inefficient solar and wind have since dragged the overall efficiency of Germany’s green energy supply down to just over 20%.

That’s horrendous from a technical and economic point of view. At that level, it’s only a question of a very short time before you find your competitors running circles around you.
Note in the chart that photovoltaic systems barely reach 10% of their capacity, wind barely reaches 20%. No wonder electric bills in Germany have been skyrocketing and companies are saying “auf Wiedersehen”.
Although the amount of green energy produced in Germany has gone up, it has become very inefficient overall.
Worse, the more wind and solar systems get installed, the more intermitently the conventional systems end up running, thus making them far less efficient and costlier. Result: Germany’s entire energy production system is rapidly becoming sub-par. That’s bad for the environment, the consumer’s pocket book, and for the country’s global competitiveness.
Call it communist power management. In the communist days it took 10 men to the job of one man in a free market. On the energy market, it takes 5 green generators to do the job of a single conventional generator.
Little wonder that Environment Minister Peter Altmaier says Germany’s transition to green energy is going to cost $1.3 TRILLION dollars if the madness isn’t stopped soon.

"Larry Elliott correctly identifies the wartime scale of responses to the coronavirus as signalling the jettisoning of obsolete economic theory (The coronavirus is leading to a whole new way of economic thinking, 22 March). It already involves bypassing deficit handwringing as well as massive Bank of England spending using quantitative easing, with its first-step e-printing of £200bn. Once QE and government spending are – hopefully – providing adequate resources for the health service, and the necessary financial cushion for businesses and workers, it will be time to urgently consider what lessons can be learned to tackle the other all-pervasive threat to our future – the climate emergency. Central bankers used “bankers’ QE” to help tackle the 2008 financial crisis and are now turning to “coronavirus QE”. While working to bring this latest threat to human health under some degree of control, it is time to also plan for “green QE” to fund a global green new deal to transform the health of the planet. In the UK this would involve the Bank of England e-printing hundreds of billions of pounds. A new national investment bank would issue bonds that would be bought using QE and the money used to fund a green and decentralised infrastructure programme. This could include a decades-long, multi-skilled initiative involving energy refits of all 30 million UK buildings, a shift to localised renewable energy and food production, and the building of local transport and flood defence systems. The last war led to the NHS; this one must result in a green new deal.Colin HinesConvener, UK Green New Deal Group   • In his excellent opinion column on how the coronavirus crisis will transform our current economic and social models, William Davies says: “It may end up devaluing urban centres, as it becomes clear how much ‘knowledge-based work’ can be done online” (The last global crisis didn’t change the world. But this one could, 24 March). I live close to the City of London. The usually congested streets there are almost deserted; most financial buildings stand empty. If the financial system can apparently carry on with a large proportion of its workforce working from home, we must ask whether we actually need the massive conglomeration of mainly ugly, expensive, energy-guzzling buildings that I can see from my window. It seems more and more evident that these glassy towers, still being built and rebuilt even as I write, now mainly serve as the vanity projects of corporate bosses. Perhaps this outdated model of financial centralisation is already redundant? Without great loss, couldn’t they be turned over, at least to a large extent, to housing for the UK’s homeless – or other socially useful projects?Carl GardnerLondon • William Davies and others are suggesting that the Covid-19 crisis is the sort of world-making event that allows for new economic and intellectual thinking. If we take the response to the climate crisis as an example, we may be overly optimistic. Many of us have been campaigning for many years, but only now has the world paid attention when teenage activists have spoken truth to power. Yet governments and corporations are still dragging their feet or are in denial. One crisis is due to carelessness, the second to misfortune; who knows if there will be a third. Covid-19 has motivated community action and, while we are in lockdown, we could bring together disparate thinkers and activists to form online citizens’ assemblies. We need the reach to be as wide as possible; this can’t be just an academic exercise. There are many with the experience to lead and coordinate, and crowdfunding would finance a long-term initiative. Unless we speak truth to power and can coherently argue our case with policy, strategic and practical solutions, it will be business as near usual as possible.Rosamund AubreySt Ishmaels, Haverfordwest"

There have been some interesting writings coming out of AEI’s new Center for Defense Studies recently. On Friday, Daniel Blumenthal offered some thoughts on China. In the course of making the case that Chinese leaders should realize that we are not trying to contain China, he wrote the following: 





If countries acted in accordance with rational actor theories of political science, the Chinese would be pretty well assured that we are not going to contain it. We have made clear across administrations that we welcome China’s rise as a great power and urge it to act as a responsible one.   
  
  
But countries do not act in accordance with political science theories.



Later in the piece, he wrote the following: 



China is not the only country that is rising. So is India. But we do not worry about India’s rise. That is because India is a democracy. Almost everything it does is transparent to us. We share liberal values with India, including the desire to strengthen the post‐​World War II liberal international order of open trade and investment and the general desire among democracies to settle internal and external disputes peacefully and democratically. The fact that China is not a democracy matters greatly as it rises. It makes its rise more disruptive as countries have to divine its intentions and observe the gap between its rhetorical policy of a “Peaceful Rise” and some of its actions that are inconsistent with a peaceful rise.



He closed thusly: 



Wouldn’t it be nice if China got on board with all the post‐​modern, feel‐​good notions about international politics put forth by the Obama Administration? In the 21st century, says the Obama team, all countries have common interests in confronting transnational issues like climate change and proliferation. Sorry guys, those who lead China think 21st century international politics will look more or less like it did in the past. They favor good old fashioned power politics. Unfortunately for Obama, that forces us to do the same.



There’s an awful lot of interesting stuff going on here. First, Blumenthal’s claim that “countries do not act in accordance with political science theories” is strangely incoherent. As his second and third quotes above make clear, Blumenthal has a political science theory–two actually.   




With respect to India, the theory he is expounding is called “liberalism” in IR jargon. This theory places the causes of war at the so‐​called “second image” level: wars occur because some states are bad and their badness causes them to do bad things. India being a good (democratic) state means we should be friends with it. (There is another variant of liberalism that centers on international institutions, which is mostly but sometimes not bound up with the democracy‐​focused version.)   
  
  
In the latter paragraph about China, Blumenthal looks like he’s dropped liberalism and glommed onto traditional balance‐​of‐​power realism: that is, as a state’s power grows it wants more influence at the international level; positions in the balance of power change in a zero‐​sum fashion; as China grows richer it will seek a larger security role and we will not want to afford it such a role. “Good old fashioned power politics,” as Blumenthal calls it.   
  
  
What’s most curious is Blumenthal’s seeming desire to dismiss _the very idea of political science theories_. My colleague Ben Friedman has dealt with this concept before, noting 



efforts to weigh the costs of war inevitably involve theories of how the world works. As my Professor Steve Van Evera likes to point out, foreign policy makers can use good or bad theories to guide their actions, but if they attempt the slightest foresight, they cannot have none. In other words, there is no such thing as foreign policy without foreign policy theory.



That is, without a theory about how the world works, we would be simply paralyzed by the prospect of issuing advice on foreign policy.   
  
  
Today, Gary Schmitt at AEI wrote the following in criticizing Andrew Bacevich: 



the real, underlying point of not only this particular piece but his views more generally is one connected to his own particular brand of conservative Catholicism. For Bacevich, the U.S. is too secular, too trade happy, too materialist. (”The exploitation of women” referred in his article is not, as presumably the _Post_ editors thought, about “equal pay for equal work” but more likely about the sexual objectification of women.) You see, America is really a nation of imperfect men, marked by original sin, who have no right to take the lead globally. Our real concern should be with our own failings‐​not American preeminence.   
  
  
Taking his lead from Reinhold Niebuhr, Bacevich believes we are on an utopian mission to remake the world–or, in this instance, the Muslim world; it is a program that is immoral both because it is impossible (and hence counterproductive) given human nature and because, in pursuing it, we adopt policies that chip away at our own morality. (The ends begin to justify the means, etc, etc.) The more limited our ambitions in Bacevich’s view, the less damage we do to ourselves and others.   
  
  
All of which contains a kernel of truth–but only a kernel. _Whatever problems we face domestically, it is just an historical fact that a broader American vision abroad has typically made us a better people at home. Nor is there any evidence that a less expansive (and hence less expensive) foreign and defense policy would free up monies that miraculously would solve a problem like poverty or second‐​rate schools. To the contrary, more government funds could well confound finding the policies that would actually help alleviate those problems._ However, the larger point is that Bacevich and other conservative critics, like George Will, are standing on unsound ground when they argue that the transformative goal of the Long War is utopian. It might be long and it might be difficult but, if anything, the evidence so far suggests that the establishment of decent democratic regimes is possible in all kinds of regions and in countries with diverse cultural histories. That hardly means that failure in the Long War isn’t possible; but to hear Bacevich and others tell it, is inevitable. (emphasis mine)



The italicized portion above is just bizarre. In Schmitt’s reading, spending tax dollars on welfare or education “could well confound finding the policies that would actually help alleviate those problems.” This is a fairly straightforward conservative argument. What’s strange is that Schmitt makes the argument that _while the U.S. government likely could not figure out how to improve education or the general welfare in the United States, it can parachute into faraway countries and improve the governance over there. Or it at least ought to try, since “a broader American vision abroad has typically made us a better people at home.”_ This is, to my mind, utterly, profoundly incoherent. I think the most important point is that we ought not to send our military overseas to kill and die so that we can be “a better people at home.” But I wonder how Schmitt’s view fits into the argument made by Brian Schmidt and Michael Williams in this article. For Schmidt and Williams, neoconservative views on foreign policy are merely an extension of their domestic policy. To wit: 



A social order based purely on narrowly egoistic interests, neoconservatives argue, is unlikely to survive–and the closer one comes to it, the less liveable and sustainable society will become. Unable to generate a compelling vision of the collective public interest, such a society would be incapable of maintaining itself internally or defending itself externally. As a consequence, neoconservatism regards the ideas at the core of many forms of modern political and economic rationalism–that such a vision of interest can be the foundation for social order–as both wrong and dangerous. It is wrong because all functioning polities require some sense of shared values and common vision of the public interest in order to maintain themselves. It is dangerous because a purely egoistic conception of interest may actually contribute to the erosion of this sense of the public interest, and the individual habits of social virtue and commitment to common values that sustain it.



I am reminded of Irving Kristol’s statement that “A nation whose politics turn on the cost of false teeth is a nation whose politics are squalid.” It’s something of a parlor game in IR to debate whether neoconservatism is its own IR theory; whether it’s a theory at all, of anything; whether it’s really just liberalism; et cetera, but what would be really good to have is a clear statement that could be scrutinized on its own merit. Until then one is left guessing or, at best, turning up weird conspiracy theories about Leo Strauss and the University of Chicago on the internet.

"**The leader of a council with the lowest rate of Covid-19 cases in Wales has criticised national rules imposed on the local hospitality trade.**
Sam Rowlands from Conwy Council said he was disappointed the first minister had adopted a national approach rather consider regional differences in cases.
A new tier system is being brought in to manage the virus in England.
On Friday, First Minister Mark Drakeford said a single set of rules made it easier for people to follow.
Conwy county has seen under 20 cases per 100,000 people in the past seven days, compared with an all Wales average of 189.8 cases per 100,000 people.
In an open letter to the first minister, Mr Rowlands highlighted his ""disappointment at the announcement of an all Wales set of further restrictions to the hospitality sector"" which employs 10,000 people across the county.
""There is not any significant concern with this sector as any spread of the virus we are currently seeing is through household transmission,"" wrote the Conservative councillor.
""I'm very disappointed to hear today that you're not looking to take into account any regional variance of the risk of the virus with restrictions you are considering in the lead up to Christmas.""
Pubs, bars and restaurants had only reopened on 9 November after the Wales-wide 17-day lockdown, and currently close at 22:00 GMT.
New restrictions, which have not yet been finalised, will come into force from 4 December.
A Welsh Government spokesperson said: ""Coronavirus does not respect borders, whether they are in Wales or further afield.
""We need to use the coming weeks to reduce the spread of the virus and create more headroom for the Christmas period, for the whole of Wales.
""We are very aware that the hospitality sector has worked hard to put in place measures to protect the public and we know this will be a worrying time for all working in the industry.
""However, new restrictions will need to focus on the places where we meet and where coronavirus thrives, drawing on the recent evidence from the UK Sage group of experts about what interventions have the biggest impact on the virus."""

Speakers at the Republican Convention this week have routinely praised the success of Trump’s economic policies, even though his record is, at best, mixed even if one discounts the COVID-19 pandemic. When it comes to the public’s perception of Trump’s trade policies, however, he seems to have accomplished something truly impressive, if a bit bizarre: almost the entire public—regardless of party—has now come to support international trade as a concept.



This differs starkly with the wide partisan differences that hold on many other foreign policy issues.



Thanks to a paradoxical Trump bump, nearly 90 percent of both Democrats and Republicans now say they support international trade. 



In a poll conducted last summer by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, for example, 78 percent of Republicans said they considered immigration to be a “critical threat” to the country’s “vital interests,” while only 19 percent of Democrats were similarly alarmed. In contrast, 78 percent of Democrats found climate change to be a “critical threat” while only 23 percent of Republicans agreed. And 54 percent of Republicans, but only 36 percent of Democrats, said they found the development of China as a world power to be such a threat, even as 69 percent of Democrats, but only 37 percent of Republicans, expressed concern about foreign interference in American elections. The gap on whether the United States should share its “leadership role” with other countries was also wide: 75 percent of Democrats agreed, but only 51 percent of Republicans.



Ask those same people how they feel about international trade, and the picture looks much different.



Until Trump, about 55 or 60 percent of the population supported trade when asked a rather standard and straight‐​forward question: “Overall, do you think international trade is good or bad for the US economy?” As you might expect, Republicans were a bit more supportive during the presidency of George W. Bush, while Democrats were more in favor of trade when Barack Obama was in the White House. 



However, under Trump, both percentages have abruptly soared to the point of almost complete consensus: nearly 90 percent of _both_ Democrats and Republicans now say they support international trade, and the same holds for independents.



This remarkable phenomenon seems to have arisen from a difference in perception. Republicans conclude that, since Trump appears to _support_ international trade, it must be a good thing. Democrats come to the same conclusion, but from the opposite direction. They look at Trump’s tariffs and other anti‐​trade behavior and reckon that, since Trump appears to _oppose_ international trade, it must be a good thing.



Some of that confusion is probably due to Trump’s own mixed messages. The president has repeatedly characterized himself as a free trader. But, he says, he needs to engage actively to level the playing field by, for example, slapping tariffs on countries he judges to have broken the rules.



People tend to hear what they want to hear. In this instance, that has paradoxically enhanced support for international trade on both sides of the aisle. In some respects, it is the ultimate con, confirming, perhaps, that you _can_ sometimes fool all the people some of the time—though in this case, the foolery is in a good direction.



But it is unlikely that Trump is doing this consciously. And whether this agreeable, if unintended, bump will outlive his presidency remains to be seen.

Chimney sweeps are making a comeback in Great Britain. “According to the National Association of Chimney Sweeps,” the _Telegraph_ reports, “Britain is experiencing the largest boom in chimney sweeping since Victorian times. ‘It’s been remarkable,’ said president Martin Glynn. ‘When we started NACS in 1982, there were just 30 members. Today we have 540 members nationally.’” The reason? Gas and electricity prices have risen so high that people prefer to burn wood in their previously unused or underused fireplaces.    
  
  
Why are the energy prices so high? The British government’s pathological obsession with renewable sources of energy. Converting renewable energy ( _e.g._ , wind and solar) is much more expensive than conventional sources of energy ( _e.g._ , coal and gas). Since the government mandates that a certain percentage of energy consumption has to consist of renewable sources, energy prices are rising – fast.   
  
  
That leads to this amazing paradox: Progressivism started in Victorian England – a time and place of tremendous and unprecedented material and social progress that, nonetheless, also had a darker side. The stories of workers living in freezing and damp dwellings, children chimney sweeps suffocating while on the job, and environmental degradation, were both horrific and true.The evolution of progressivism has come full circle and progressives have turned reactionary: To combat the (highly uncertain) effects of climate change, modern‐​day progressives have embraced policies that lead to more burning of wood, freezing homes for the poor and vulnerable, and chimney sweeps back at work.

Antidumping and countervailing duty (AD/CVD) measures are unable to fix the low‐​price problem afflicting U.S. steel producers because they amount to no more than a band‐​aid that can’t heal the wound. Worse, such trade remedy measures do great harm to manufacturing companies by making steel in the United States higher in price than in most of the rest of the world. This tends to make downstream manufacturers less competitive, thus encouraging imports of steel‐​containing products from other countries.



A better approach would be to take advantage of an underlying economic reality: because the U.S. steel‐​consuming sector is so much more economically significant than the steel‐​producing sector, low‐​priced steel imports provide a substantial net benefit to the U.S. economy. China’s policies encourage the export of steel at artificially low prices, which has the effect of transferring wealth from China to the United States. The United States should change the dynamic of the debate by encouraging China to continue transferring wealth by selling all the low‐​priced steel it possibly can in this country. That approach is likely to get the attention of Chinese policymakers and hasten the downsizing and restructuring that is so badly needed in that country’s steel sector.



In addition, U.S. statutes should be reformed to specify that AD/CVD duties would enter into effect only when economic analysis indicates that they would improve economic welfare in the United States. Yes, low‐​priced steel imports may be “unfair” to U.S. steel producers. But the United States should avoid responding to this unfairness with policies that are even more unfair because they impose much larger costs on the steel‐​consuming sector than any benefits that might accrue to steel producers.



China's ""socialist market economy"" has been driven far too much by socialist planning and not enough by the actual marketplace. Decisions at various levels of government within China have encouraged undisciplined investments in steel capacity, which have led to a large gap between China's ability to produce steel and the demand for it. Because much of the production increase has been generated by government policies, it is clear that China's steel exports aren't really ""fair."" However, a lot of things in life aren't fair — it's just necessary to make the best of them.



So the question of interest to policymakers should be: What policy response would allow the United States to make the best of those unfair circumstances, preferably turning them to America's advantage?



It is helpful to start by reviewing some realities of the political economy of China's steel market. Many Chinese steel mills never would have been built at all if those investors had been subject to the market pressures of a fully open and competitive economy. Earning a positive return on invested capital has not been an important objective for mills that are owned or heavily influenced by governments. As a consequence, capacity has been added for which there is no effective demand, either in China or overseas. Estimates of overcapacity worldwide (most of which is in China) range in excess of 600 million metric tons,1 equivalent to more than a third of annual global steel output.2 (See Figure 1 and Table 1.) Some of that capacity may close in the coming years, perhaps without ever having been operated profitably.



In the near term, however, China appears to be dealing with its unwise steel investments largely by making a second unwise decision — that is, operating many mills at a loss instead of just shutting them down. This is bad for China because it uses resources inefficiently. It also creates political complications for other countries, including the United States. However, the economics of the situation can work to America's benefit. Since China is selling steel for less than it would be worth in an economy guided solely by market forces, U.S. steel consumers are getting a bargain. China's decision to run its steel mills at negative rates of return means, in essence, that China is helping to increase the competitiveness of U.S. manufacturers that use steel as an input. In terms of the underlying economics, China takes the losses and the United States reaps the gains. What's not to like about those circumstances?

Yes, domestic U.S. steel producers are exposed to unfairly low-priced steel and are understandably unhappy. Their traditional response has been to seek relief from troublesome imports, primarily by filing antidumping and countervailing duty (AD/CVD) petitions. There are two reasons that this approach does not serve the best overall interests of the United States.



One is that today's steel market for commodity products is so far out of balance that trade remedy measures simply can't bring the U.S. industry back to profitability. The global supply of commodity steel products is so large that prices are low worldwide. No matter how many trade remedy band-aids are placed on that wound, they won't raise U.S. prices sufficiently to stop the financial bleeding.



The other shortcoming of AD/CVD orders is that — even if they could provide some help to U.S. steel manufacturers — they would do great harm to downstream U.S. firms that use steel as an input. True, U.S. steel producers employ tens of thousands of people. But steel production adds far less value to the U.S. economy and employs far fewer people than do downstream manufacturers.



Data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) at the Department of Commerce indicate that value added by ""primary metal manufacturing"" amounted to $59.7 billion in 2014.3 (Note: Primary metal manufacturing [NAICS 331] includes nonferrous metals, such as copper, aluminum, magnesium, lead, tin, silver, and gold, so is much broader than the steel industry.) Downstream manufacturers that utilize steel as an input generate value added of $990 billion, more than 16 times larger than primary metal industries. The disparity in employment also is more than 16 times greater. Primary metal manufacturing employed 399,000 people in 2014.4 Downstream manufacturers employed 6.5 million. (Employment by U.S. steel producers is somewhere in the neighborhood of 100,000.)



The point is not that steel production is a small and insignificant industry, because clearly it is not. Rather, the point is that the problems of the steel industry need to be kept in perspective. It would be a poor policy choice to attempt to protect steel producers in ways that do much greater harm to steel users.



One of the sad realities is that AD/CVD orders can make the United States a relatively high-priced island in a world awash with lower-priced steel. Not having access to competitively priced inputs can lead quickly to sales losses for companies that manufacture goods containing steel. Overseas firms that benefit from lower costs will be able to export products to the United States and undersell U.S. manufacturers. So imposing trade remedies is a great way to reduce the economic welfare of the United States, thus making this country poorer.



One example might be Carrier, the company that recently announced it would shift manufacturing air conditioners from two plants in Indiana to Monterrey, Mexico. This decision, which will lead to the loss of 2100 jobs, has inspired commentary in the presidential campaign. The company's official statement does not attribute the change specifically to higher U.S. prices for key inputs covered by AD/CVD orders. However, the statement does say, ""This move is intended to address . . . ongoing cost and pricing pressures.""5 It seems likely that some of those cost pressures relate to U.S. trade remedies, 19 of which restrict imports of various steel products from China. (Not all of those steel products would be used in the manufacture of air conditioners.) Other AD/CVD orders apply to imports of copper tubing, which is an important component of air conditioning systems, as well as aluminum extrusions. If the United States wishes to create a more favorable business climate for manufacturers, a good start would be to revoke AD/CVD orders that raise the costs of their components. These are costs that Carrier largely can avoid by moving operations to Mexico.6



What should be done instead of using trade remedies? U.S. policymakers should take advantage of fundamental economics. China's decision to export steel for less than it is worth has the effect of transferring wealth from China to the United States. As a practical matter, the best way to encourage China to downsize and restructure its industry would be to reframe the debate by communicating the following message to the Chinese government:



Thank you for transferring so much wealth from China to the United States by selling low‐​priced steel! Please continue doing it! Is China willing to sign ten‐​year contracts guaranteeing that wealth transfers will continue?



By radically changing the terms of the discussion, this approach has a decent prospect for getting the Chinese quickly to rethink what they have been doing. The current U.S. approach is to complain to them about how much their exports are hurting American steel producers. Instead, that argument should be turned on its head by thanking them for helping to strengthen the competitiveness of the much larger U.S. steel‐​consuming sector.



Adopting that strategy is not only the right thing to do based on economics, it also would tend to get the attention of Chinese policymakers in a genuinely constructive way. China’s senior leaders may find it challenging to explain to their people why they are continuing to allow below‐​cost steel to be sent overseas to the great benefit of the United States and other countries. Temporarily maintaining employment in Chinese steel mills may be nice, but at the cost of subsidizing undeserving Americans? That’s probably not a winning political argument, even in China.



Would removing all AD/CVD restrictions against steel imports sound the death knell for the U.S. steel industry? Fortunately, no. Steel producers understand that their markets tend to be cyclical. When prices are at cyclical lows, many U.S. steel companies experience financial losses. This is not a new phenomenon. Experience in previous periods of low prices indicates that capacity utilization rates for the industry as a whole tend to decline. Some mills producing commodity products may close for a few months, perhaps longer. There may be restructuring or consolidation among firms. These changes — especially in combination with industry downsizing and restructuring in China and other countries — would lead relatively promptly to restoring a balance between steel supply and demand that would allow profitable operation of U.S. mills.



It likely would be preferable to both employees and stockholders of steel companies to get past the bottom of the cycle as quickly as possible. There would be little joy from a prolonged downturn that could be expected in response to an ongoing series of AD/CVD orders imposed in a vain attempt to protect the U.S. steel industry from adverse market circumstances. Continuing on the traditional trade‐​remedy path likely would encourage Chinese leaders to resist reforms. Why should they suffer political costs to change policies in order to make the United States happy? By shifting the dynamic and encouraging China to continue exporting a large quantity of low‐​priced steel, the United States has a far better chance to get China to make badly needed adjustments in its industrial policies.



It is important to understand that the nature of the U.S. marketplace also provides some degree of protection to domestic steel companies, especially those producing high‐​quality and specialty steels. High‐​end items are more difficult to produce and are higher in price than commodity grades. The trend in recent decades has been for the U.S. steel industry to rely less on the sale of commodity products, instead moving toward manufacture of higher‐​value grades of steel. Specialty steels are required by customers for certain well‐​defined uses. Such customers will only use steel that has passed qualification tests in advance, so tend to have long‐​term relationships with suppliers. Manufacturers with exacting requirements for their steel inputs often are reluctant to attempt to qualify producers that previously have not been business partners, especially if those potential suppliers are located far away in other countries. Manufacturers find it somewhat comforting to have major suppliers located relatively nearby so that transportation logistics are not excessively complicated. In other words, realities of producer‐​customer relationships provide the U.S. steel industry with partial insulation from overseas competition.



U.S. steel producers may not be comfortable with an open‐​market approach. The challenge to them is to outline an alternative policy that would do a better job of improving U.S. economic welfare. It is doubtful they can do so. Certainly it would be difficult for the U.S. steel industry to make a compelling argument that their economic interests are somehow more important than those of companies that require steel as an input for their value‐​added manufacturing processes.



The optimal policy response would be to reform U.S. trade remedy statutes by adding a new requirement: AD/CVD duties only should be imposed if economic analysis indicates that doing so would increase economic welfare in this country. This would be an elaboration of the “public interest” test applied by some other nations as they consider whether to impose AD/CVD measures.



Fortunately, adding such a requirement to U.S. law would not pose a substantial administrative burden. Economists on the staff of the U.S. International Trade Commission already have access to relevant data in the injury phase of AD/CVD investigations. They also have the necessary analytic tools and experience to provide this analysis. The statute should be changed to instruct ITC commissioners to consider the broad economic welfare effects of proposed AD/CVD duties and to vote in the affirmative only when those duties will redound to the net benefit of the United States.



People on both sides of this issue should be able to agree that the U.S. government should avoid policy responses that do more harm to the economy than any harm that could be done by unfairly priced imports. It is important to ensure that the policy “cure” isn’t worse than the “disease” of low‐​priced steel. The goal should be to pursue policies that serve the best overall interests of the United States.

Yes, it floats on water, and has a Fresnel lens from the local high school projectionist club, but what about typhoons and lesser gales? No mention of that. Somehow, this bullet point from the Overview page doesn’t seem reassuring:
Floating the system on water reduces the need for expensive supporting  structures to protect it from high winds. The lenses submerge in winds  above 60km/hr and the water also cools the cells which increases their  efficiency.

Sunengy, Australia partners with Tata Power to build the first floating solar plant in India
Indian trial of a unique Australian solar system will move it towards full production
 
0.28 scale aluminium prototype

Australian solar power  company Sunengy Pty Limited has entered into a partnership with India’s  largest integrated private power utility, Tata Power that will allow it  build a pilot plant for its low-cost, floating-on-water, solar  technology in India by the end of this year.
Sunengy Chairman and Executive Director of Business Development, Peter Wakeman,  said that Tata Power, a flagship company of Tata Group, has partnered  with Sunengy for its interest in its patented Liquid Solar Array (LSA)  technology. Mr Wakeman said the deal was significant for the future use  of solar globally because it allows Sunengy to demonstrate  the practicality of its technology in one of the world’s most promising  solar power markets.

The LSA was invented by Phil Connor, Sunengy Executive Director and Chief Technology Officer and a passionate advocate for solar power for 45 years. Mr Connor said  that when located on and combined with hydroelectric dams, LSA provides  the breakthroughs of reduced cost and ‘on demand’ 24/7 availability that  are necessary for solar power to become widely used. The LSA uses  traditional Concentrated Photovoltaic (CPV) technology – a lens and a  small area of solar cells that tracks the sun throughout the day, like a  sunflower. Floating the LSA on water reduces the need for expensive  supporting structures to protect it from high winds. The lenses submerge  in bad weather and the water also cools the cells which increases  their efficiency and life-span. According to Mr Connor, hydropower  supplies 87 percent of the world’s renewable energy and 16 percent of  the world’s power but is limited by its water resource. He said an LSA  installation could match the power output of a typical hydro dam using  less than 10 percent of its surface area and supply an additional six to  eight hours of power per day. Modelling by Sunengy shows, for example,  that a 240 MW LSA system could increase annual energy generation at the  Portuguese hydro plant, Alqueva, by 230%. “LSA effectively turns a dam  into a very large battery, offering free solar storage and opportunity  for improved water resource management,” Mr Connor said. “LSA needs no  heavy materials or huge land acquisitions and is effectively cyclone  proof,” he said. “If India uses just one percent of its 30,000  square kilometers of captured water with our system, we can generate  power equivalent to 15 large coal-fired power stations.”



Mr Banmali Agrawala, Executive Director, Tata Power said “In our quest to deliver sustainable energy, Tata Power  is consistently investing in clean and eco-friendly technologies. We  have partnered with Sunengy, Australia for a pilot plant in India, which  is concentrated photovoltaic solar technology that floats on water.  This nascent technology will be demonstrated in the natural environment;  it utilises the water surface for mounting and does not compete with  land that can be used for other purposes.”
Mr Wakeman said that the primary  market for LSA is the provision of industrial scale electricity via  hydropower facilities. Other markets include mining sites as well as  villages and remote communities reliant on diesel power generators.
Construction of the pilot plant in  India will commence in August 2011. Sunengy plans to establish a larger  LSA system in the NSW Hunter Valley in mid 2012 before going into full  production.

"After ten years of negotiations, Russia’s Gazprom and the China National Petroleum Company (CNPC) have announced they have signed a 30-year gas contract. Russia will from the end of this decade supply 38 billion cubic metres (bcm) per annum of gas to fuel the booming cities of northeast China, in a deal thought to be priced at US$350 per thousand cubic metres of gas – about the same price Russia sells to Europe – or around US$400 billion, according to Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller. President Putin has put the investment in gas field development and pipelines at US$55 billion, of which US$20-25 billion may be financed by China, either by pre-paying for its gas or through loans. The deal also entails other traditional features of long-term gas contracts such as linking the gas price to oil and oil product prices, and a take-or-pay clause to ensure minimum annual deliveries. So the deal appears to be commercially rational and beneficial for both parties. For Russia and Gazprom, the benefits are commercial and political. Gazprom’s vast gas resources in East Siberia, effectively stranded until now, have found a market and a price that will allow the company to make a reasonable 10% return on its investment in the project. Importantly, it will also lay the foundations for the expansion of Russia’s gas business into Asia. Gas exported as liquified natural gas (LNG) has been leaving the Sakhalin 2 terminal in Russia’s Far East since 2009. But the construction of the Power of Siberia pipeline, linking Vladivostok and Khabarovsk and the Yakutia gas and oilfields both to pipelines further west and to China, will open up significantly larger exports for China and also for the local domestic market, and potentially lead to an LNG liquefaction plant at Vladivostok. The new pipeline should also spur further development of new reserves discovered off Sakhalin Island.  Psychologically this deal has also demonstrated that, despite the protracted nature of the negotiations, Gazprom is able to successfully open up new avenues for its gas in an increasingly competitive global market. Politically, it has demonstrated that both Russia and Gazprom have options aside from its markets in Europe, which contribute around 50% of the company’s revenues at present. This point should not be overstated though; Europe has been Gazprom’s most important market for decades and will remain so for many years to come. But establishing an alternative equivalent to 25% of exports to Europe in 2013 does allow the company and the country the room to relax if Europe decides to aggressively remove its reliance on Russian energy. Realistically, this is unlikely: Europe has few alternatives, and exports to China are likely to be a bonus for Gazprom and the Russian treasury once the gas starts to flow by 2020. For China the deal is also positive for a number of reasons. The country’s gas demand is set to more than double by 2020 with a switch from coal to gas, and this will provide a significant new source of ongoing supplies. Now the Chinese gas import compass has a northern axis to add to its supplies from Central Asia in the west, Myanmar to the south, and from LNG supplies brought supplied from various sources to the east. The agreed price sets a useful benchmark that is competitive with China’s current imports, and provides a marker for future deals that should allow CNPC to start to close the gap between domestic and imported gas prices. Overall, both Russia and China have reasons to be happy with the eventual conclusion of these long-running negotiations. Russia can monetise new gas reserves and diversify it’s export markets while still making a reasonable rate of return, reducing reliance on Europe and building the foundations for substantial eastern markets. China has secured a competitively priced gas supply until 2050 that will when it starts meet 10% of estimated demand. It also helps further diversify its own imports while helping switch the country away from dirty coal that has choked its cities. It is a deal which makes considerable commercial and political sense, with the only surprise being that it has taken so long to conclude."

It had to happen. In the midst of the record snowfall in the East, some mainstream media outlet had to try to link this season’s unusual weather events to global warming.



_Time_ was the first news organization to take the plunge. It published such an article on February 10 — and that very day, Washington, D.C., broke its 1899 seasonal snow record of 54.5 inches with its third official blizzard of the winter. Today, the _New York Times_ joined the party.



Like 2010, winter 1899 was characterized by multiple heavy snowstorms, especially in February. Sometimes the jet stream locks into a position where it is capable of creating such a string. As has been painfully obvious, this is one of those years. 



Before 1942, D.C.‘s official snow totals were taken downtown. The record since the measurement started being recorded at Reagan National Airport, set in 1996, has been eclipsed by ten inches this year.



The big January 1996 storm put down 17.1 inches at Reagan. The January 22, 1996, _Newsweek_ cover featured a man disappearing in a whiteout with the headline “Blizzards, Floods, and Hurricanes: Blame Global Warming.” The cover story, written by the voluble science populist Sharon Begley, claimed that global warming allows more moisture into the air so that snowstorms can become bigger. Her go‐​to scientist was NASA’s James Hansen — who more recently became famous for calling coal drags to your local power plant “death trains” and advocating war‐​crime trials for the executives who daily force you to put gasoline in your car. (So clearly we should expect no hyperbole from _that_ camp.) 



This winter, D.C. has placed _two_ storms in the top ten: The 18.0 inches that fell on February 5–6 ranks number four, and the 16.4 on December 18–19 is number eight. _Time_ ’s Bryan Walsh, who has a difficult time with the concept that improbable events are not impossible, thought this sufficiently bizarre to root online for any source that could be used to blame it on dreaded greenhouse gases. (Walsh found it in a semi‐​obscure 2003 study in the _Journal of Climate_ , though he did not actually link to it in his article.)



And so the argument was trotted out again that mid‐​Atlantic storms can hold more moisture in a warmer world, and therefore can produce more snow. Anyone who would claim this surely does not understand the climatology of snow in Washington, D.C. 



There are plenty of storms, usually up to 20 per winter, that are moist enough to produce snow but instead drop rain, or the unaesthetic combination of sleet and freezing rain that I call “sleeze.” Why no snow? Because there is simply not enough cold air available. Why so many near‐​snow events, like sleeze storms? Because there’s often _almost_ enough cold air for snow.



To simplify things somewhat, snow requires that the temperature at 5,000 feet be at freezing or below. When a low‐​pressure system moves up the Atlantic seaboard, warm winds ride on top of it, raising the temperature to the point that it cannot support snow. In order to counter this, there usually has to be a replenishing supply of cold air from New England, which comes in the form of the high‐​pressure systems that often form ahead of the storm.



Scientists have known for a long time that the modest greenhouse effect we have experienced will have a disproportionate effect on these cold‐​air masses. So, thanks to climate change, the cold air that’s needed for Washington snow is increasingly hard to come by. Moisture is not the problem: Snowflakes fear warm air.



The fact of the matter is that global warming simply hasn’t done a darned thing to Washington’s snow. The planet was nearly a degree (Celsius) cooler in 1899, when the previous record was set. If you plot out year‐​to‐​year snow around here, you’ll see no trend whatsoever through the entire history.



But of course, there are those who _insist_ that it snowed more when they were little. That’s partially a matter of physical perspective, as 20 inches of snow on the ground looks a lot bigger to a three‐​foot child than to a six‐​foot adult. It’s also a matter of lack of historical perspective. The three winters from 1977 through 1979 are the coldest in the entire U.S. record, and 1979 included the third‐​ranking snowstorm, the so‐​called President’s Day Mess.



Did I mention that the popular press back then, including _Time_ and _Newsweek_ , did not hesitate to blame the winters on the climatic bogeyman of that era — global cooling?

"**Nottinghamshire's return to the top tier of Covid-19 restrictions is ""a kick in the teeth"", residents have said.**
The city and county moved into tier three in October, but a four-week England-wide lockdown has seen the rates of positive cases drop.
Some residents said the decision will affect their livelihoods, with one describing it as heartbreaking.
The government said rates remained ""very high"" among those over 60.
Lia Primrose, 17, who is studying health and social care at college, said: ""It just feels like a bit of a kick in the teeth after cases went down so much.""
She said that because she worked as a waitress, she would be unable to return to work and described the announcement as, ""the biggest heartbreak"".
Her classmate, Poppi West, also 17, added: ""It feels like we're going round in circles.
""I know it's not the biggest issue but we're both nearly 18 and we won't be able to go out and have a drink to celebrate. It's just a bit sad.""
Pat West, 63, from Newark, said she did not understand why the region was in tier three.
""I'm really disappointed,"" she said. ""My grandchildren can't come round to see me at home. I'm not seeing them grow up.""
Julia West, 69, from West Bridgford, said: ""I think it's disheartening we're going back into tier three after we all did our bit to bring it down.
""I feel especially for the young people who need some sort of outlet.""
Nottingham Trent University students Laura Puttock and Emma de Duve said they were ""absolutely gutted"".
""It's our 21st [birthdays] in December,"" said Laura.
""It's our last year of uni and we thought we could have a last celebration, but now it's going to have to be a takeaway.
""It's hardly the 21st I'd dreamed of. It just feels [as if] we've done our bit, cases are going down, but we're still not seeing any change.
""With uni being online I wake up, sit at a screen until my eyes go square and then go back to bed, all in the same room.""
Emma added: ""Everyone was hanging on for this day to see if we were in tier two.
""I think for people's mental health just being able to go out of the house [and] meet people not from your household is really important.""
Pat Brown, 75, a West Bridgford resident, said: ""To be perfectly honest I didn't think in a million years we'd be in tier two.""
However, other residents said they had expected the announcement.
Claire Elms, who was celebrating her 35th birthday, said she felt ""sad"" but not surprised.
""I live on my own and I want to get out and meet my friends,"" she said.
Mandy Middlecote, 44, from Beeston, said she was not surprised by the announcement either.
""Cases are still pretty high,"" she said. ""Me and my family are keeping to ourselves so tier two or three doesn't make much difference.
""It would have been nice for the kids to be able to go and play with their friends, but we want to see our family at Christmas so we have to limit things.""
And some residents said they had been left confused by the reintroduction of the tiers system.
""I think a lot of people aren't even sure of the rules in the different tiers,"" said Muhammed Jonaid, 36, from Aspley. ""The difference between them baffles me.""
David Mellen, the leader of Nottingham City Council, described the decision as a ""bitter blow"".
""We will need the government to provide further support for businesses,"" he said.
""However, we must of course accept these are the new rules we must abide by and given the valiant efforts locally in the past few weeks, I have no doubt that we will continue to drive down infection rates and be able to leave tier three and enter tier two very soon.""

"**York Minster clergy say it is a ""blessing and a relief"" that worship can restart under new Covid rules.**
The city of York will enter tier two of the government's coronavirus restrictions next Wednesday.
The minster will re-open for public worship, but people will have to book online for the main services.
Rev Canon Vicky Johnson, precentor at York Minster, said there would be restrictions in place and Advent and Christmas would be very different.
She said: ""It is a blessing and a relief that worship and visiting can restart at York Minster and that we will be present for people as they prepare for Advent and Christmas.
""The ongoing need to control the virus means that capacity at services will be severely limited.
""Attendance at key services on Sundays and in Christmas Week will only be possible via our pre-booked online reservation system.
""However, digital worship has flourished at York Minster this year so all of our Advent and Christmas services and events, will be available digitally via livestream and on platforms such as YouTube and Facebook.""
The minster says it has implemented a range of measures to help keep visitors and staff safe, including compulsory mask wearing, limiting the number of people allowed inside, reduced seating and a one-way system.
Changes to services, include no singing and the suspension of the Holy Communion common cup, will continue.
Ahead of the reopening, one of the largest Advent wreaths in the UK was raised inside the minster.
The new Archbishop of York, The Most Reverend Stephen Cottrell, watched as the 4m-wide (13ft) wreath was lifted into place below the Central Tower.

"Covid-19 isn’t just infecting humans. It’s also weakening ideology. Think about Tina: the acronym popularised after Margaret Thatcher declared that “There is no alternative” to the market economy.  From the 1980s on, a thoroughgoing and overt commitment to capitalism became fundamental to every mainstream political party. Well, if Tina was a person, you’d find her today languishing in an overcrowded ICU, as, all around, the coronavirus forces a recognition of the alternatives always available. Not so long ago, Boris Johnson won the 2019 election decrying Jeremy Corbyn’s welfare plans as “money tree” socialism. A few months later, his administration announced it would pay the wages of all those who had lost their jobs, a plan that the chancellor of the exchequer Rishi Sunak correctly described as “unprecedented in British history”. Meanwhile, as Owen Jones notes, ConservativeHome now demands “Big State Government on a scale unknown in modern times”, while pundits in the right-leaning Spectator urge Johnson to “borrow from Corbyn’s playbook”. Across the Atlantic, the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, was not so long ago inflicting market-driven cuts on medical services for the vulnerable. But, with New York a centre of infection, Cuomo is – rhetorically, at least –currently out-Sandering Bernie Sanders: decrying competition between manufacturers of masks, gowns and other medical supplies as inefficient and wasteful, and urging the nationalisation of factories to distribute goods according to need. Likewise, Scott Morrison’s administration has, almost overnight, delivered one of the largest boosts to benefits in Australian history, with “Scotty from Marketing” effectively doubling the rate of jobseeker payments. How, you might wonder, was a dole judged too low to feed and house those laid off during the pandemic considered adequate in July last year, when Morrison decried a boost to Newstart as “unfunded empathy”? The question illustrates the problem with the Damascene ideological conversions taking place all around us: namely, that they’re too little, too late. After all, if welfare hadn’t been such a whipping boy for politicians for decades, something might have been done to fix the decrepit Centrelink website so that it didn’t crash right when people needed it most. If Australia had invested in a decent public broadband system back when the economy was growing, those of us now working from home wouldn’t be dealing with stuttering, buffering video links. If the Fair Work Act hadn’t been systematically weighted in the interests of capital, companies such as Qantas wouldn’t be able to respond to coronavirus by standing down employees without pay. More generally, if successive governments hadn’t sold off the plum state-owned assets, the government might now have more options for cushioning current pain. One could go on but you get the idea: the failures of today stem from the choices of the past. To put it another way, if there’s an economic alternative now, there was an economic alternative then – and we are all suffering from the ideologically-driven failure to take it. Now, we can’t step back in time. But we can change what happens next. The Covid-19 catastrophe demonstrates – if any demonstration is needed – that prevention is better than cure. It shows that scientific experts know, by and large, what they’re talking about, and that their modelling accurately predicts real world effects. The implications for climate change could not be more obvious. Scientists have told us, over and over again, that a warming planet will deliver increasingly horrific disasters, with the recent Australian bushfires a taste of what’s to come. After the last weeks, it’s simply not credible to say nothing can be done about the rising temperatures. We don’t have to wait for some market mechanism to sort things out. Other alternatives exist – and the sooner we embrace them, the less disruption we face. In the end, ideology matters less than material interest. The politicians currently buffeted by extraordinary events will, quite soon, recover their equilibrium – and, when they do, we should expect a return to the old rhetoric, as the big end of town insists the rest of us pay for what’s happened. Indeed, the economic devastation will be used to justify more of the same indifference to the threats of the future, with climate action dismissed as a job-killing indulgence in a time of mass unemployment. But it doesn’t have to be like that. We have a chance to build from the wreckage – to learn from this crisis and prevent the crisis we know is coming. If we don’t, it will all happen again. • Jeff Sparrow is a Guardian Australia columnist"

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf you can’t find any real warming on the planet (which scientists haven’t been able to do now for 15 years), then you have to make up something that looks like warming, i.e. create dummy warming. This is precisely the case with a new paper on Western Antarctica.
==========================================
Western Antarctica warms more quickly than thought – however, hardly at all in the last 25 years
By Dr Sebastian Lüning and Prof Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
We recently got some hot news from Antarctica. According to a study by a team led by David Bromwich of Ohio State University in Columbus, which appeared just before Christmas 2012 in Nature Geoscience, Western Antarctica warmed up more quickly than first thought. This of course pleased alarmist newspapers like the online Süddeutsche Zeitung (SZ), who without hesitation wrote:
With a temperature increase of 2.4°C since 1958, the central region of Western Antarctica is among the regions that are warming up the fastest on the planet. […] There the temperature is rising three times faster than the global average.”
Now that really stirs up fear. Global warming is apparently advancing rapidly in Western Antarctica and temperatures are climbing and climbing. This is taking place year after year, and so it is only a matter of time before the catastrophe strikes. To underpin this claim, the Süddeutsche Zeitung presents a temperature curve of Western Antarctica going back 55 years (Figure 1…in the SZ article it is necessary to click on the figure to see the curve). An enormous temperature jump is obvious beginning in the year 2000, as the temperature skyrockted. With another jump like that, the ice in Western Antarctica would never survive, one might think.

Figure 1: January temperatures of Western Antarctica. Source: Süddeutsche Zeitung, 23 Dec 2012.
But wait. When it comes the the Süddeutsche Zeitung one has to be a little careful. It has long been known that the Süddeutsche Zeitung (SZ) is cozily cuddled together with climate alarmism (e.g. see our blog article“Schlimmer als befürchtet: Die Süddeutsche Zeitung verliert den klimawissenschaftlichen Boden unter den Füßen“ (Worse than we feared: The Süddeutsche Zeitung loses its scientific bearings). So let’s take a closer look.
Unfortunately we quickly discover mischief. The temperature curve for January readings used in the SZ does not even get mentioned or appear in the quoted paper. The warming value named by David Bromwich and colleagues has much more to do with the annual average temperature of the Western Antarctica, and whose curve is of course depicted in the paper (red curve in Figure 2). This curve, however, shows a completely different course than the one used by the SZ. Do you see it?
Crivens! In the last 25 years the West Antarctic has not gotten warmer! If anything, the temperature has remained flat. It is indeed quite a stretch to claim that Western Antarctica is among the most rapidly warming areas on the planet.
Over the last two decades temperatures in the region have gone nowhere.

And now if you look a little closer, you see that the warming is mainly concentrated in the period of approx. 1962-1980. Did mankind produce an extraordinary amount of CO2 during that particular period? No. The Co2 emissions were nothing different from what we had at other times. What is remarkable, however, is that the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) during this time went from a negative cool phase to a positive warm phase (Figure 3). It cannot be ruled out that this nearby climatic oceanic phenomenon may have had something significant to do with the Western Antarctic 2.4°C warming until 1980 mentioned in the paper. Moreover, there is also the warming due to the increase in solar activity and atmospheric CO2 concentration. The 2.4°C can be divided up into natural (ocean cycles and sun) and anthropogenic share (CO2, soot, etc.). The SZ could have mentioned that.

Figure 3: Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) over the last 110 years. 
Unfortunately the SZ reader is left alone with only the context of the article. According to new ICEsat satellite data, the Antarctic ice sheet as a whole has increased in mass over the last years (see our blog article on this). The much larger Eastern Antarctica dominates, and that area has gotten colder over the last years. Also Antarctic sea ice reached a record high extent just a few months ago for the 30-year satellite era. Not a peep about both of these stories from the Munich-based SZ.
It also would have been nice if the SZ had provided its readers another important piece of background information: Unexpected but true: the post Ice Age temperatures at the Antarctic Penninsula were at today’s levels for 7000 years (also see our blog article on this here). With this background, the temperature development of the last 55 years discussed by the SZ loses considerable relevance. And it was also a pity for the SZ that David Bromwich and his team dumped cold water on their results for sea level rise. With gnashing teeth, the SZ had no alternative but to report:
Because at the high elevation Byrd-Region mean temperatures of -10°C prevail in the summertime, the warming does not lead directly to large-scale melting, say the scientists.”
It is quite amazing that the SZ creates almost only dramatic climate stories. Sober, non-alartmist reports just don’t seem to be of any interest for SZ editors. There’s plenty of non-alarmist material out there. At our blog we present new scientific results almost daily. We welcome editors at SZ to help themselves to it..

"Record heat and drought across Australia delivered the worst environmental conditions across the country since at least 2000, with river flows, tree cover and wildlife being hit on an “unprecedented scale”, according to a new report. The index of environmental conditions in Australia scored 2019 at 0.8 out of 10 – the worst result across all the years analysed from 2000.  The year delivered unprecedented bushfires, record heat, very low soil moisture, low vegetation growth and 40 additions to the threatened species list. The report’s lead author, Prof Albert van Dijk of the Australian National University’s Fenner school of environment and society, told Guardian Australia 2019 was “probably the worst in a century or more” for the environment. “This is not the new normal – this is just getting worse and worse,” he said, adding that 2019 had seen a “continuing descent into an ever more dismal future. You start to see ecosystems fall apart and then struggle to recover before the next major disturbance.” The Australia’s Environment report scored environmental conditions across seven indicators – inundation, streamflow, vegetation growth, leaf area, soil protection, tree cover and the number of hot days. Across all years analysed, 2005 was the next worst year, impacted by the millennium drought. The year 2010 was the best; it was also one of Australia’s wettest on record. Van Dijk said the cause of the impacts for 2019 were global heating as well as natural variability in Australia’s climate. The number of days above 35C was 36% higher than the previous 19 years. The population had continued to grow and the country’s greenhouse gas emissions had remained high, the report said. Greenhouse gas emissions per person were 11% below the 2000-18 average, but remained among the highest in the world because of high energy use per person and the burning of coal for electricity. Findings were underpinned by about 1m gigabytes of data, including satellite data that only became available from 2000, as well as field data and on-the-ground surveys. Reviewing biodiversity impacts, the report highlighted the number of spectacled flying foxes – one of many species vulnerable to heat stress – had dropped to 47,000 from an average of 100,000 before 2016. The numbers of threatened species had risen by 36% since 2000, the report said. River flows were 43% below the 2000-18 average, causing water storages to drop and mass fish deaths in the Murray-Darling Basin, and wetland environments had also seen record-low inundation. River flows were above average around the coast of northern Queensland, around Karratha in Western Australia and at Strahan in Tasmania’s west. The protection of soils by vegetation and moisture was “extremely poor”, causing dust storms. The average soil moisture was also lowest since at least 2000 and farming productivity had been hit. The Great Barrier Reef, which has just experienced its third mass bleaching event in five years, had escaped bleaching in 2019 but its condition remained poor. World heritage-listed Gondwana rainforests, the Blue Mountains, alpine regions, eastern Gippsland and Kangaroo Island had all been badly hit by bushfires. A co-author of the report, Dr Marta Yebra, said: “Our data clearly shows that the combination of dry forests and hot weather made for an especially explosive mixture.” All the findings and data from the report, now in its fifth year, can be viewed on a website and interactive map."

Peter Williams must be pleased to be free of the TVNZ censor. How it must have rankled with him to have to read all the auto-cue items on the TVNZ ‘news’ bulletins. He has now come out.



I am so over the nonsense that is being propagated by politicians and policymakers about this thing that is now just referred to as “climate change.”



Every day it is being foisted upon us. The world is in crisis. There is going to be a disaster, a catastrophe. The world is going to end. We have 12 years. We have 10 years. **Some nutbag appeared on The AM Show yesterday saying it will end in seven years**.



Prince Charles says we have 18 months left before it is irreversible and the world will end.



 **Why do we allow people to get away with this?** Why is there absolutely no debate that these prophets of gloom may possibly be wrong?



Why is it that not just Stuff, but it seems all media in this country refuse to allow even a skerrick of evidence that CO2 may not be the cause of the earth’s warming?



Those of us who ask questions, and do not accept what we are having forced upon us, are now being called deniers.



Note the phrasing, the use of language. As if words like catastrophe and crisis and emergency were not enough, those who are skeptical are now being called “deniers.”



The last group of people to be called deniers were those who believe the holocaust didn’t happen.



The thing is, we know the holocaust happened. We have physical evidence of graves, of concentration camps, of gas chambers and of people being loaded onto trains to go there and never be seen again.



How can people who ask questions about the changing climate and whether CO2 and other gases in the atmosphere be called “deniers?” The arrogance in the putdown is breathtaking.



 **Why are people not allowed to ask questions?** Why are people not allowed to make observations about what they see in front of them outside every day? Why are we not allowed to ask about all those other predictions of 30 years ago which have not come true?



Why am I so worked up about this? I’ll tell you why. **We are being fed BS by our politicians, politicians from both parties** who refuse to ask questions? Politicians and policymakers who use the phrase ” the science is settled.” Science can never be settled. How can science be settled? […]



It’s the same with weather and climate. How come the earth in the last 2000 years has been through multiple warming and cooling periods?



And remember the last 2000 years are just a blip on the length of time the solar system and planet earth has been in existence. 



That ridiculous interactive front of website piece on Stuff this morning tells us breathlessly that we have more CO2 in the atmosphere now than at any stage in the last 3 million years.



Wow – do you know how long this planet is estimated to have been in existence? 4.5 billion years. […]



Like, why is Greenland called Greenland? Because about a thousand years ago it was home to a population of Vikings who lived and thrived there in a climate that allowed food to grow and animals to be farmed. It was the era known as medieval warming. Then the Little Ice age came along and wiped that population out.



That little ice age ended in the first half of the 19th century. Since then the earth has been getting warmer. 



Now in this age of instant information, there is a lot of information available online which presents a different view of the world’s climate.  
The James Shaws of this world will say these people are climate change deniers? […]



This video asks questions. It challenges what has become the propagated modern-day story of CO2 induced climate change. It asks whether the sun could be the major player in the way the world’s climate has changed and continues to change. […]



Watch this and then ask – why are James Shaw and Julie Ann Genter and almost our entire Parliament doing what they are doing? […]



It is up to you to make up your own minds on this.



But if you listened to what Willie Soon and David Legates said, tell me they don’t know what they’re talking about.

"Since being universally ratified in the 1980s, the Montreal Protocol – the treaty charged with healing the ozone layer – has been wildly successful in causing large reductions in emissions of ozone depleting substances. Along the way, it has also averted a sizeable amount of global warming, as those same substances are also potent greenhouse gases. No wonder the ozone process is often held up as a model of how the international community could work together to tackle climate change. However, new research we have published with colleagues in Nature shows that global emissions of the second most abundant ozone-depleting gas, CFC-11, have increased globally since 2013, primarily because of increases in emissions from eastern China. Our results strongly suggest a violation of the Montreal Protocol. A global ban on the production of CFCs has been in force since 2010, due to their central role in depleting the stratospheric ozone layer, which protects us from the sun’s ultraviolet radiation. Since global restrictions on CFC production and use began to bite, atmospheric scientists had become used to seeing steady or accelerating year-on-year declines in their concentration. But bucking the long-term trend, a strange signal began to emerge in 2013: the rate of decline of the second most abundant CFC was slowing. Before it was banned, the gas, CFC-11, was used primarily to make insulating foams. This meant that any remaining emissions should be due to leakage from “banks” of old foams in buildings and refrigerators, which should gradually decline with time. But in that study published last year, measurements from remote monitoring stations suggested that someone was producing and using CFC-11 again, leading to thousands of tonnes of new emissions to the atmosphere each year. Hints in the data available at the time suggested that eastern Asia accounted for some unknown fraction of the global increase, but it was not clear where exactly these emissions came from. Scientists, including ourselves, immediately began to look for clues from other measurements around the world. Most monitoring stations, primarily in North America and Europe, were consistent with gradually declining emissions in the nearby surrounding regions, as expected. But all was not quite right at two stations: one on Jeju Island, South Korea, and the other on Hateruma Island, Japan. These sites showed “spikes” in concentration when plumes of CFC-11 from nearby industrialised regions passed by, and these spikes had got bigger since 2013. The implication was clear: emissions had increased from somewhere nearby. To further narrow things down, we ran computer models that could use weather data to simulate how pollution plumes travel through the atmosphere. From the simulations and the measured concentrations of CFC-11, it became apparent that a major change had occurred over eastern China. Emissions between 2014 and 2017 were around 7,000 tonnes per year higher than during 2008 to 2012. This represents more than a doubling of emissions from the region, and accounts for at least 40% to 60% of the global increase. In terms of the impact on climate, the new emissions are roughly equivalent to the annual CO₂ emissions of London.  The most plausible explanation for such an increase is that CFC-11 was still being produced, even after the global ban, and on-the-ground investigations by the Environmental Investigations Agency and the New York Times seemed to confirm continued production and use of CFC-11 even in 2018, although they weren’t able to determine how significant it was. While it’s not known exactly why production and use of CFC-11 apparently restarted in China after the 2010 ban, these reports noted that it may be that some foam producers were not willing to transition to using second generation substitutes (HFCs and other gases, which are not harmful to the ozone layer) as the supply of the first generation substitutes (HCFCs) was becoming restricted for the first time in 2013. Chinese authorities have said they will “crack-down” on any illegal production. We hope that the new data in our study will help. Ultimately, if China successfully eliminates the new emissions sources, then the long-term negative impact on the ozone layer and climate could be modest, and a megacity-sized amount of CO₂-equivalent emissions would be avoided. But if emissions continue at their current rate, it could undo part of the success of the Montreal Protocol. While this story demonstrates the critical value of atmospheric monitoring networks, it also highlights a weakness of the current system. As pollutants quickly disperse in the atmosphere, and as there are only so many measurement stations, we were only able to get detailed information on emissions from certain parts of the world.  Therefore, if the major sources of CFC-11 had been a few hundred kilometres further to the west or south in China, or in unmonitored parts of the world, such as India, Russia, South America or most of Africa, the puzzle would remain unsolved. Indeed, there are still parts of the recent global emissions rise that remain unattributed to any specific region. When governments and policy makers are armed with this atmospheric data, they will be in a much better position to consider effective measures. Without it, detective work is severely hampered.

The Bureau of Economic Analysis has released its annual data on compensation levels by industry (Tables 6.2D, 6.3D, and 6.6D here). The data show that the pay advantage enjoyed by federal civilian workers over private‐​sector workers continues to expand.   
  
  
The George W. Bush years were very lucrative for federal workers. In 2000, the average compensation (wages and benefits) of federal workers was 66 percent higher than the average compensation in the U.S. private sector. The new data show that average federal compensation is now more than double the average in the private sector.   
  
  
Figure 1 looks at average wages. In 2008, the average wage for 1.9 million federal civilian workers was $79,197, which compared to an average $50,028 for the nation’s 108 million private sector workers (measured in full‐​time equivalents). The figure shows that the federal pay advantage (the gap between the lines) is steadily increasing.   






Figure 2 shows that the federal advantage is even more pronounced when worker benefits are included. In 2008, federal worker compensation averaged a remarkable $119,982, which was more than double the private sector average of $59,909.   






What is going on here? Members of Congress who have large numbers of federal workers in their districts relentlessly push for expanding federal worker compensation. Also, the Bush administration had little interest in fiscal restraint, and it usually got rolled by the federal unions. The result has been an increasingly overpaid elite of government workers, who are insulated from the economic reality of recessions and from the tough competitive climate of the private sector.   
  
  
It’s time to put a stop to this. Federal wages should be frozen for a period of years, at least until the private‐​sector economy has recovered and average workers start seeing some wage gains of their own. At the same time, gold‐​plated federal benefit packages should be scaled back as unaffordable given today’s massive budget deficits. There are many qualitative benefits of government work—such as extremely high job security—so taxpayers should not have to pay for such lavish government pay packages.   
  
  
**Update:** I respond to some criticisms of this post here.   
  
  
**Update 2:** Compensation data for federal workers vs. other industries here.   
  
  
**Update 3:** In September, the government revised the data for private sector workers. On 9/30/09, Figure 1 and the related text were updated to reflect this change.

"We’ve just been through an unusually mild winter for the UK. Despite the excessive rain and storms, the warmer temperatures meant we’ve needed less energy to heat our homes.  This has reduced household energy bills, providing a welcome respite from ever increasing prices. But the weather has also had an undoubted benefit for the British economy, as we’ve had to import significantly less energy than would normally be the case.  Weather patterns are not under the control of legislators. But measures to promote energy efficiency are and could, if implemented on a large enough scale, produce an effect similar to a mild winter: warmer homes and less energy required to heat them. So just how big a difference did the weather make? Data released late last month from the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) allows us to compare energy use during the two recent and contrasting winters: October 2013 to March 2014, which was unusually mild and the same period for 2012-13, which was colder than average. The data also enables us to compare the reduction in imports of primary energy during these periods, particularly coal and natural gas. These two fossil fuels are associated with electricity generation and heating – the areas most impacted by energy efficiency improvements in buildings. The DECC data shows that companies generating electricity used nearly 5.6m less tonnes of coal during winter 2013-14, compared to winter 2012-13. If we estimate, conservatively, that about 75% of the coal consumed is imported (there are only two deep coal mines still operational in Britain, Kellingley in Yorkshire and Thoresby in Nottinghamshire), this works out as a cut in coal imports of 3.9m tonnes, equivalent to 28,100 gigawatt hours (GWh) of thermal energy. At a cost of £70 per tonne, this represents a financial saving to the UK of £280m. The reduction in demand for electricity was also felt by gas-fired and nuclear power stations, but to a less significant degree than coal, and the amount of electricity generated from wind increased. The reduction in the use of coal to generate electricity was due to a genuine overall drop in electrical demand, not just substitution of one fuel for others. Other DECC data show a reduction of 83,000 GWh of natural gas consumed by the UK during the 2013-14 winter compared to 2012-13. The department’s statistics provide further detail on this reduction to show that overall imports were down by 60,000 GWh. This comprised 33,000 GWh less through the pipeline which runs across the Channel from Belgium, 19,000 GWh less from Norway, and 8,000 GWh less in the form of liquid natural gas by ship from Qatar. With wholesale natural gas costing around 1.5p per kWh, this adds up to a £900m saving from reduced natural gas imports.  Put the savings from coal and gas together, and we estimate that warmer-than-usual weather saved the UK nearly £1.2 billion in energy imports over the comparable six month period. This is a not inconsiderable sum – 3.5% of the 2012 UK trade deficit of £33.9 billion. So if the vagaries of the British weather can cut primary energy imports and result in a clear economic benefit to the UK by reducing its trade deficit, this is to be rightly welcomed. Especially as the UK becomes even more dependent on imports for its primary energy supplies. Why not then strive to ensure that these benefits are not just left to the weather, but could be enjoyed every year by improving buildings’ energy efficiency? It would seem an aim worthy of cross-party political support: reduce energy imports, improve the trade deficit, improve the UK’s housing stock and reduce fuel poverty. Maybe it is time that the wider macro-economic benefits were included in the debate around energy efficiency. Given the potential for significant and lasting improvements to UK’s trade deficit, why shouldn’t the Bank of England provide long-term funding to support energy efficiency measures? Like an energy efficiency equivalent of a War Bond. While cost is a major factor in the uptake of energy efficiency measures, there are also many non-financial barriers that have plagued schemes such as the Green Deal. Money spent on researching these factors for the benefit of advising legislators would be money well spent. If greater energy efficiency could produce the £1.2 billion saving equivalent to the mild winter, but every year – regardless of the weather, the Treasury should recognise the value of energy efficiency and give it the same political support as it would to increase UK exports by £1.2 billion. And the more energy the UK has to import in the future, the more valuable this saving may become. If ever there’s been a case of spend to save, this is it."

The Tagsspeigel writes:
‘There has never been anything like this in Berlin in the last third of March since snow measurements began in 1895,’ says weather expert Friedemann Schenk of the Meteorological Institute for the Freien Universität (FU).”
The English-language The Local here reports that Germans should not expect spring to arrive anytime soon, as the German Weather Service (DWD) warns that “the record-breaking wintry weather will continue until Easter“.
This weekend will be especially cold. T-online news site writes:
In the east, temperature readings will drop dramatically – many readings will be -10°C, as low as -13°C in some spots. ‘Some cold records for end of March will fall,” prophesies Ruhnau.”
Germany’s RBB forecasts temperatures down to -15°C! The extreme cold overall will make this March in Central Europe the coldest and snowiest in over 40 years – at least.
The Local adds:
Record-breaking levels of snow fell in other areas of the northeast – namely in Laage, Mecklenburg Western-Pomerania, where a blanket of 27 centimetres of snow smashed the region’s previous 2005 record for the time of year by six centimetres. ‘For March 20th, the amounts are impressively high,’ said Simon Tripper, a meteorologist from the DWD, on Wednesday afternoon. “

Environmentalism is the ultimate luxury item. Only the rich can afford to work themselves into a lather about the mooted possibility that people 100 years from now might be 2 percent less wealthy than they might otherwise have been. Ordinary people are too busy trying to make sure the lights and power stay on. People living in actual poverty are too selfishly concerned with trying to find something to eat and make sure their kids survive past five years old.



So it’s no coincidence that the so-called “schools climate strike” was mostly restricted to the privileged scions of the bourgeoisie attending wealthy private schools. Environmental activism is invariably the preserve of the idle middle-class who can afford to make a career out of annoying the hell out of people trying to work for a living.



A 20-year-old climate activist who glued himself to a road in a protest lives with his parents in a lavish mansion, it has been revealed.



Well, **there’s** a surprise.



Extinction Rebellion protester Eric Serge Herbert has been arrested five times for his demonstrations, which included blocking the entrance to the Brisbane Magistrates Court and stopping traffic with a canoe on a road. 



The former school captain was living in Sydney and studying nanoscience at the University of New South Wales before he dropped out and returned to his family home.



If you’re too thick to actually learn how to do something useful, just go and sponge off mummy and daddy. After all, mums and dads are wealthy enough to probably vote Green.



The waterfront five-bedroom, four-bathroom mansion in Pelican Waters on the Sunshine Coast also comes with a freestanding aquarium, vacuumaid, a triple lock garage and a private jetty, The Courier-Mail reported.



But they have solar panels, surely?



Despite claiming to create a classless society, communist regimes were invariably **obsessed** with class. While ostensibly lionising the proletariat, communist leaders were almost mostly drawn from the middle-classes. So, they invariably engaged in an elaborate charade of “prolier-than-thou”, desperate to disguise their bourgeois origins.



Nothing has changed.



Herbert has claimed on social media that he does not live with his parents, but during his first court appearance in June, the climate activist told the magistrate he lived with his parents who supported him…Herbert, who is unemployed, has been fined $2,050 and has stayed in the Brisbane watch house for several nights. 



Herbert, who is a triplet and one of five children, went to Unity College, a Catholic and Uniting Church school in Caloundra on the Sunshine Coast.



As Orwell noted in _The Road to Wigan Pier_ , “causes” like these attract the idle and the useless like “bluebottles to a dead cat”. Perhaps realising their essential uselessness, the pampered scions of the elite try to kid themselves that they’re part of some noble cause, rather than just worthless prats getting in the way of people who are actually doing something useful.



Herbert was fined $550 for gluing himself to a zebra crossing in Brisbane’s CBD and causing three hours of traffic chaos on June 17.



He was then handed a $600 fine for blocking Victoria Bridge with a canoe on June 26.



The climate activist blocked the entry of the Brisbane Magistrates Court on July 11 and was fined $400 and had a conviction recorded. Four days later he blocked streets in the city and was fined $500.



On July 17, Herbert was arrested for public nuisance and was bailed.



  
It’s high time police and the courts took up journalist Rita Panahi’s suggestion: just leave these stupid children right where they are – put a couple of traffic cones around them and let motorists take their chances.



They’ll unglue themselves and scurry back to their parents’ mansions in no time.

 _Hell Pizza_ have taken it upon themselves to decide whether or not you are allowed to eat meat. Without disclosing the true nature of their product, _Hell Pizza_ included fake, plant based meat on their burger pizzas. Most people probably thought they were eating meat. Turns out they weren’t.



Hell Pizza denies misleading customers by covertly serving fake meat, despite a lawyer’s warning the company may have breached the Fair Trading Act.



Thousands of Kiwis unwittingly sampled Beyond Meat after Hell quietly added the product to its menu.



If a customer thinks they are eating meat and they are not, then the franchise has deliberately misled its customers. Those paying for the privilege of eating their pizzas do have the right to know what they are eating, and to expect a pizza with ‘meat’ on it, to include… meat.



If it were me, I would have been absolutely furious to have been duped like that.



The New Zealand-owned chain launched its burger pizza last Friday, with ingredients including “medium-rare burger patty”. 



_Hell_ says that they never said it included meat… but here’s the thing. Unless you are told otherwise, burgers include meat. Those that don’t are clearly defined, usually as ‘veggie burgers’. There is nothing wrong with a veggie burger, but there is something very wrong about a company letting you think you are eating meat when in fact, you are not.



After selling thousands of the pizzas to customers around the country, Hell revealed on Wednesday the patties were a [plant-based creation from US company Beyond Meat](https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/world/112483219/beyond-meat-the-us5-billion-vegan-unicorn-has-captured-attention?rm=m). 



Marketing lawyer Rae Nield said there was a high risk Hell was in breach of the Act, which protected consumers from being misled.  




“What does a reasonable consumer expect if it says “burger” and there’s no qualifier – it doesn’t say “veggie” or “meat-free”. A reasonable consumer is going to think that means meat.” 



Absolutely, and I guarantee that most customers thought exactly that – that they were eating meat. Hell misled their customers all right.



Why the hell did _Hell_ do this? Well, waddaya know!



Cumming said the company had wanted to introduce customers to alternative proteins in an unexpected way and had expected mixed feedback.



“We care about the planet and want to start a conversation and raise awareness about sustainable food choices.



So they are climate Nazis. They think we should all be eating plants, and they have the right to tell us what to do, or even to make us do it. Hey, that is fine, (well maybe… or maybe not) but tell us what we are eating. It is my choice. If I want to eat meat, I will. If I want to eat plant based produce, I will; but I’m damned if I am going to be force fed anything and be lied to about it at the same time… and pay for the privilege.



“A lot of people are instantly put off by the idea of fake meats, so we made the call to not reveal its meat-free origins to [people] eating it because we were so confident they’d enjoy these patties,” he said. 



A lot of people are put off fake meat for good reason. I have vegan friends who think we should also be vegan. They seem to think that, if they expose us sufficiently to their way of life, we will soon see the light. They won’t. I will forever remain on the dark side. Their food is disgusting.



There is another problem, and deliberately withholding the truth about what people were eating could well have caused some people with allergies to expose themselves to serious danger. _Hell_ should know better.



‘Peas are legumes. People with severe allergies to legumes such as peanuts should be cautious when introducing a pea protein into their diet because of the possibility of a pea allergy…’ But if you think you are eating meat, you probably don’t worry, and you quite possibly do not bother to check the ingredient list. You already know whether or not you can eat meat. That is potentially dangerous.



Demand for meat-free options was increasing and as well as almost selling out of its limited supply of Beyond Meat, _Hell_ had sold 35,000 vegan pizzas so far this year, Cumming said.  
“With more pressure on the planet’s resources, we need to think about alternative food options. 



I sincerely hope that _Hell_ get into a hell of a lot of trouble for this, because, whether they admit it or not, they were **deliberately misleading** their clients. At the very least, they have issues with the Fair Trading Act. For me, this is it. I don’t eat a lot of pizza, but when I did, it was always _Hell Pizza_. Never again. I like to know what I am eating, I hate being duped, and above all, no one has the right to make a decision about my food on my behalf. 



It is great to know I am never going to _Hell._.. never again anyway.

Brrr…the Troposphere Is Ignoring Your SUV
by Roy W. Spencer, Ph. D.
For those tracking the daily global temperature updates at the Discover website, you might have noticed the continuing drop this month in global temperatures. The mid-tropospheric AMSU channels are showing even cooler temperatures than we had at this date with the last (2008) La Nina. The following screen shot is for AMSU channel 6
click image to enlarge

A check of the lower stratospheric channels (9, 10) suggests this is not a stratospheric effect bleeding over into the tropospheric channels.
With the current (and forecast to continue) stormy pattern over the U.S., I have to wonder whether the atmosphere is currently in a destabilized state. I doubt that surface temperatures anomalies are as anomalously low as the mid-troposphere temperatures are running, which in combination with anomalously cold mid- and upper-tropospheric temperatures means there is extra energy available for storms. (Since AMSR-E failed in early October, our sea surface temperature plot is no longer showing current data, so I have no easy way to check surface temperatures.)
Of course, this too shall pass. I just thought it was an interesting curiosity during a time when some pundits are claiming global warming is “accelerating”. Apparently, they are still stuck in the last millennium.

Whenever you’re being regaled with a climate alarmist’s latest hysterical claim that the entire planet is on the cusp of being roasted to a cinder, the most important thing to keep in mind is that they’re almost certainly not talking about the real world. Instead, their scaremongering is almost certainly based on projections and computer models. If any real-world data is allowed to intrude, it’s been “adjusted” to within an inch of its life.



Computer models are not the real world, any more than Google Earth is an actual place. Climate models are _Matrix_ -like simulations… if the Matrix were a Donkey Kong style, 8-bit world of badly-rendered coloured blocks.



Climate models are in fact pretty lousy at simulating the real world. Which is why they have continually ‘run hot’, overestimating the amount of warming the world would actually see. Certainly, climate models are sophisticated computer simulations, but when it comes to sophistication, the real world knocks them out of the park. For instance, climate models still cannot accurately model what one might think is a pretty important factor: clouds. [Recent analysis](https://scitechdaily.com/climate-models-underestimate-the-cooling-effect-that-clouds-have/) suggests that models underestimate the cooling effect of clouds.



Now another study argues that models are underestimating the effect of vegetation on carbon dioxide absorption – and hence, climate.



Most Earth system models agree that land will continue to store carbon due to the physiological effects of rising CO2 concentration and climatic changes favoring plant growth in temperature-limited regions. But they largely disagree on the amount of carbon uptake…[Reseach] suggests that most models largely underestimate photosynthetic carbon fixation and therefore likely overestimate future atmospheric CO2 abundance and ensuing climate change.



This is important. Almost no one disagrees that atmospheric carbon dioxide affects the Earth’s climate to some degree. But everyone also knows that carbon dioxide is essentially ‘plant food’. Indeed, it is well known that the recent rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide is correlated with a ‘global greening’ as the Earth’s vegetation increases. In turn, these new plants consume more CO2 – a process known as “enhanced photosynthetic carbon fixation”, or Gross Primary Production, GPP. The question, though, is how much does the ‘greening’, if any, offset increased carbon emissions, and how will this affect climate?



Predicting climate change requires knowing how much of the emitted CO2 (currently ~40 Pg CO2 _yr_ – _1_ ) will remain in the atmosphere (~46%) and how much will be stored in the oceans (~24%) and lands (~30%)…[these might] help to reduce uncertainty in multi-model projections of terrestrial carbon cycle entities.



The great boreal forests of Canada and the Russian Taiga are some of the most forested on Earth and have shown a distinct trend of increased leaf cover in recent decades.



This study is focused on the northern high latitudes (NHL, north of 60°N) where significant and linked changes in climate and vegetation have been observed in the past 3–4 decades…We therefore hypothesize that the greening sensitivity (i.e., leaf area index, LAI, changes in response to changes in the driver variables) inferred from the historical period of CO2 increase can be used to obtain a constrained estimate of future GPP enhancement from both the radiative and physiological effects.



…the available longest records of carbon exchange between the land/ocean and atmosphere (1980–2015) indicate that NHL lands changed from being a small carbon source in the early 1980s to a strong sink in the mid-2010s.



The question is, of course, are climate models accurately reflecting this trend? The answer is no. Most (CESM1-BGC, NorESM-ME, and CanESM2) strongly underestimate the amount of CO2 that global greening is scrubbing from the atmosphere. Some models overestimate. Only one (MIROC-ESM) matched the carbon-absorption data with any reliability.



The tendency for GPP underestimation in NHL by models reported here is also seen at the global scale This, together with another recent study, suggests that most models are underestimating photosynthetic carbon fixation by plants and thus possibly overestimating atmospheric CO2 and ensuing climatic changes.



  
There’s that “settled science” again.

"Hundreds of millions of people in some of the world’s poorest countries are supported by small scale fisheries. These are usually self-employed fishers who use relatively simple methods, primarily to feed the local community and generate income. Though the impact of one small fishery may seem negligible, collectively they catch millions of tonnes per year, from some of the most biodiverse and threatened ecosystems on the planet.  Managing these tropical fisheries should be a conservation priority as we strive for sustainability and try to protect fragile marine ecosystems in a changing climate. However, this management shouldn’t just be a question of how many fish are caught, or the type of fish – as is mostly the case. Understanding the impacts of how they are caught is arguably just as important.  One kilo of fish can be caught in a variety of ways, from a variety of places at a variety of times. Fisheries regulations often focus on limiting total catch or numbers of fishers, managing single species, or restricting individual fishing methods. But for overall biodiversity and ecosystem health, the intensity and impact of fishing methods that target multiple species needs much more attention.  Just like the carbon footprint of human activities, the footprint of otherwise comparable fish catches varies significantly between different fishing techniques. For example, bottom trawling has more of a physical impact on the sea bed than line fishing.  


      Read more:
      More in depth data is required to reveal the true global footprint of fishing


 In our new paper, published in Nature Communications, we argue that to truly appreciate the impact of a single fishing technique, a multidisciplinary approach is needed. This should include the technique’s direct ecological effects, such as damage to habitat, as well as the species composition of catches. And it should also extend to its social impacts within the broader fishing community, such as whether it leads to inequities or social conflict.  To test this footprint approach, we chose to look at artisanal fish fences. These fences are semi-permanent structures, positioned close to shore, sometimes several hundred metres in length and visible from space. As fish move to deeper water at low tide, they are funnelled into the fence and trapped. They are widely used across the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans, and have received almost no research or conservation attention to date.   At first glance, they seem harmless and unremarkable. Yet the more we studied them, the more significant their footprint proved to be. During a 15-year case study in the Wakatobi National Park, Indonesia, we recorded over 500 individual species of fish being caught. A high proportion of these were caught as juveniles, before they had the chance to reproduce. Built in shallow coastal habitats, mostly seagrass meadows, owners often clear the seagrass and coral from around their fences. They also construct their fences using mangrove wood, with an average fence requiring more than one ton of wood. This makes fish fences one of the only examples of a fishing technique directly damaging three different marine ecosystems. Access to tropical coastal fishing grounds is often open to all. But fish fences close off areas, giving the owners unregulated and unofficial private access. This creates social conflict among the wider fishing community. And while they require a high initial investment, little regular effort is needed thereafter. This unique investment combination encourages fence owners to continue using them regardless of catch success and potential bycatch, exacerbating the problems of overfishing. 


      Read more:
      Small-scale fisheries are throwing away fish that could feed those in poverty


 Fishing can be sustainable. In fact, seagrass meadows, mangroves and coral reefs can support incredibly productive fisheries. Complete bans on fishing often displaces food and livelihood demands elsewhere, almost certainly involving environmental impacts of their own. But a shift in focus towards minimising catch footprints supports the basic principle of maximum catch for minimal cost. Of course, we mustn’t ignore the fact that climate change and rising sea levels threaten the future of all these ecosystems regardless of fishing. But local management targeting the most disproportionately damaging fishing practices could buy valuable breathing space. Improving the management of fish fences provides an ideal starting point. They are so widely used, and their impacts so broad and significant, that restricting their use would likely have immediate and far reaching benefits. Their large size also makes them easy to detect and monitor, making them a low effort but high reward conservation strategy. But we have to move quickly – every year that fish fences continue to be used so intensively used brings us one step closer to the point of no return."
"**Schools must be closed early ahead of the festive break to help children and teachers avoid having to self-isolate on Christmas Day, a union has warned.**
The UCAC teaching union said coronavirus cases in schools could force whole class ""bubbles"" into self-isolation over the holidays.
The union said schools should close on 11 December and move lessons online.
First Minister Mark Drakeford said there were no plans to close schools early.
In a letter to Education Minister Kirsty Williams, the union said there were ""serious concerns"" among UCAC members ""that pupils and students will continue to attend an educational setting a week before Christmas Day"".
Most schools are due to break up in the week starting 14 December, but if positive cases are found in pupils' class bubbles, children would have to self-isolate for two weeks, meaning some may have to isolate on Christmas Day.
""If a pupil or student tested positive with Covid-19 during the last week of term, it would mean that the whole bubble would have to self-isolate, preventing them from joining their extended family for Christmas,"" General Secretary Dilwyn Roberts-Young said in the letter.
""The same could be true for the education workforce.
""In addition, Test, Trace and Protect could continue to contact school and colleges leaders on Christmas Day, which is totally unacceptable.""
The union said that closing schools early would give families ""greater reassurance"" that they could get together to celebrate during the five day Christmas travel rules.
""We are acutely aware of the need to ensure continuity of learning for all pupils and students in Wales, particularly in the wake of the disruption earlier in the year, which has continued to some extent since September,"" the letter said.
""We believe that making an early announcement on this would not only allow the workforce to prepare thoroughly for that week, but also enable families to make alternative childcare arrangements as needed.""
It said a survey of members prompted a thousand responses with 75% in favour of online learning in the final week of term.
The union has also asked the minister to consider an alternative or parallel move to offer Covid tests to staff members once contact with pupils and students has come to an end, from 18 December onwards.
Some local authorities are also believed to be in favour of closing school sites a week early, though provision for children of key workers and vulnerable children would be one potential concern.
The latest Public Health Wales figures show that 50.3% of primary schools and 87.9% of secondary schools have had at least one Covid-19 case since the start of term.
There were 414 positive tests amongst school pupils or staff in the week up to 25 November.
However Mr Drakeford said he had ""no intention"" in allowing schools to close early.
""We will do everything we can to keep our schools working up until Christmas,"" he said during the Welsh Government's coronavirus briefing on Friday.
""We'll do that alongside the unions, the head teachers and the local education authorities.
""It is more important for our children not to miss out further on the education planned for them for the whole of the rest of this term. That's what we will be working to achieve."""

Share this...FacebookTwitterLast week German fundamentalist-green (now-confirmed) Die Zeit came out with a comprehensive 3-page broadsheet portrayal of the climate skeptic movement, which, not surprisingly, was unflattering. It’s a perception that the German greens are trying to infuse in it’s readers – the truth as they want to see it, but sadly for them it’s totally remote from reality.

Image source: http://www.eike–klima–energie.eu/-die-klimakrieger/
What follow are reactions from some leading German skeptics (and others), who kindly provided their comments:
Dr. Sebastian Lüning
Geologist, co-author of “Die kalte Sonne“:
Lüning commented (by e-mail) on Die Zeit‘s claim the book “had been ripped apart by experts” and the 40% CO2 increase:
We’ve debunked the critiques on our blog in the ‘medienecho‘ section and have demonstrated that there was a lot of wishful thinking and bandwagon mentality. CO2 40% up: Well, that might be numerically true, if one takes 280 ppm to 390 ppm. But more important is the real CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, which has gone up by 0.0110% = 110 ppm in real money. Sounds much less dramatic and is therefore not worded in this way.”
(Much more on Lüning‘s and Vahrenholt’s reaction later this week.)
Dr. Hans Labohm (Holland)
Journalist at Der Standaard: (left a reader comment)
As a Dutchman I’ve always thought ‘Die Zeit’ was a quality newspaper. Now I have to correct that impression. The article in question testifies of shoddy if not malicious journalism.
In the Netherlands the relationship between AGW protagonists and antagonists has markedly improved over the last few years. A broad majority of political parties in Parliament, including the Labour Party, has requested the government to include climate sceptics in the scientific debate. They would never have done so if they would have believed the story by Kohlenberg and Blasberg was a truthful reflection of reality.  The dialogue is now going on. One of the most visible manifestations to date is climatedialogue.org, which is run by a mixed group of scientists, including both AGW adherents and climate sceptics. It is sponsored by the government.
It shows that it can be done without polarization. Just follow the rules of sound scientific practice, including an open dialogue.”

The old, well-worn lie: ‘Singer is in the pay of the oil industry’ – copied, no doubt, from such discredited sources as desmogblog. AGAIN –just for the record  – I am not supported by any energy company – or by any industry for that matter.
My payments from Heartland are book royalties. Heartland has published three of my NIPCC books in the past 4 years. And we expect to do two more books in 2013. BTW, all my book royalties go to SEPP — not to me personally.
The scandalmongers from DIE ZEIT could have gotten all this info from me in the interview. All they had to do was ask me.  Obviously, they were afraid of learning the truth.”
Amazing investigative journalism – they never even bothered to ask Singer about his funding!
Dr. Holger Thuß
President, EIKE (by e-mail):
I find it remarkable that there was no word about the scientific criticism on the hockey stick graph (which was completely discredited to its core by scientific circles). Quotes were taken out of context. 
Much paper was wasted chewing and chewing on nonsense put out by climate extremist Wikipedia and bloggers. I find this outrageous.
The subliminal criticism on the anti-communist view of climate skeptics, some of them children of Holocaust survivors, is a slap in the face to victims of dictatorships and an embarrassment for German journalism.”
Note: Fred Singer, for example, actually fled the Nazis. 
Michael Limburg
Vice President, EIKE:
It’s obvious that the hot scenarios coming from the computer models have not generated enough panic up to now. Therefore it is necessary in addition to unleash top investigative journalists in order to expose those who oppose the panic-mongering, the so-called “well-paid mercenaries”, and to disarm them.
Regarding the hundreds of millions of dollars that climate deniers supposedly received from evil industry, the authors happened to forget the sources of this funding. In the spirit of ‘good and investigative journalism’ The authors just claim the climate deniers simply received it.
Only blind journalists and those who are unwilling to see the truth are good journalists at Die Zeit. A classic example for Orwellian rhetoric.”
That’s some of the reaction so far to the drive-by smear of climate science skepticism in Germany. More is sure to come.

"The warning from the World Food Programme (WFP) that 265 million people could be pushed into acute food insecurity by Covid-19, almost doubling last year’s total, is based on a complex combination of factors. WFP’s latest warning underlines the increasing concern among experts in the field that for many the biggest impact will not be the disease, but the hunger hanging off its coat tails.  While the majority of people suffering acute food insecurity in 2019 lived in countries affected by conflict (77 million), climate change (34 million) and economic crises (24 million people), the coronavirus has massively complicated existing crises and threatens to worsen others. WFP sounded the alarm in concert with a report from the Global Network Against Food Crises – an international alliance working to address the root causes of extreme hunger – that disclosed that as 2019 ended, 135 million people across 55 countries and territories experienced the highest levels of acute food insecurity and malnutrition documented by the network since the first edition of the report in 2017. The report identified a number of factors that could worsen food security in many of the 55 countries, classifying those dependent on food imports and oil exports (the price of oil collapsed to below zero this week) as particularly vulnerable, as well as those dependent and on tourism and remittances for income. “Rising unemployment and under-employment and decreasing purchasing power will have serious consequences for poor and vulnerable populations in countries already dealing with crises such as conflict and/or ongoing economic and political turmoil,” the report said. “Displaced people living in camps and displaced/host populations in urban settings as well as the elderly, young children, pregnant and lactating women, and the disabled are particularly vulnerable to the far-reaching impacts of this disease.” In Yemen, as Mark Lowcock, the United Nations emergency relief coordinator, told the Guardian earlier this week, UN agencies were already feeding 13 million people, amid a funding crisis that is threatening to many people before the impact of coronavirus is even taken into consideration. As WFP’s chief economist Arif Husain warned, “Covid-19 is potentially catastrophic for millions who are already hanging by a thread. It is a hammer blow for millions more who can only eat if they earn a wage. Lockdowns and global economic recession have already decimated their nest eggs. It only takes one more shock – like Covid-19 – to push them over the edge. We must collectively act now to mitigate the impact of this global catastrophe.” The new warning reinforces concern sounded by Lola Castro, regional director of WFP for southern Africa, last month. She said the interruption of food programmes for millions of people in the 12 countries that they cover, which have experienced three years of poor harvests because of drought, would have a “critical impact”. As Castro and other experts have made clear, what is occurring as coronavirus begins to bear down on the world’s poorest and most vulnerable countries is a perfect storm that has seen coronavirus act as an accelerant on a host of well established problems from poverty, the impact of the climate crisis, pre-existing conflict and pre-existing health crises in places with high incidence of diseases like Aids and HIV and malaria. Perhaps most pressing, beyond the immediate threat of the disease, is the economic impact in countries less able to deal with the shock, particularly for workers on daily subsistence wages. Talking about the situation in southern Africa in an interview with the Guardian last month, Castro described the specific challenges in detail. “The lean season has been very, very hard for the last three years with almost no rain and poor harvests which have left 45 million people food insecure with 8.1 million supported by the WFP.” Already, as Castro points out, new restrictions on travel, border crossing and the threat of the disease has disrupted ongoing operations even as more people have been pushed towards poverty by lockdowns affecting their ability to work. “We are already the region of the world that is the most affected by HIV-Aids. We are having to totally change our distribution models: to reduce concentrations of people at distribution points; to make sure we have hand washing facilities and that people have PPE. “Then we have to defeat borders, airlines closing, ports becoming affected, shipping and transport … we are fighting a humungous number of factors today.” Other issues have been less visible, but are no less critical, not least any impact on southern Africa’s infrastructure for food supplies which depends on a few keys ports including Durban in South Africa and Beira in Mozambique. And as Andrew Shepherd of the UK’s Overseas Development Institute explains, the economic impact of coronavirus on the poorest will be felt most sharply. “Any food price inflation that is a result of coronavirus will be worst for those who are poorest, especially those who depend on daily wages. One of the impacts of the border closures that we’ve seen is that lots of poor people living along borders subsist on cross-border trading.”"

Eric Berger writes (excerpt below) at the Houston Chronicle “SciGuy” blog about the wicked hot record breaking temperatures people were getting in Houston on their iPhones. Turns out the whole issue is over station siting. While he located the station, doing some further investigation, I’ve got shots of the actual equipment and error analysis.
The curious case of why your iPhone reports crazy hot temperatures in Houston
Eric Berger – Houston Chronicle
Over the last several days I have seen a lot of reports on Twitter and elsewhere about very warm temperatures in Houston, a few degrees warmer than those being reported by the National Weather Service. They have come from people with iPhones.
For example the “Houston” location on your iPhone’s generic weather app reported a temperature of 109 degrees yesterday at 2:50 p.m. when in fact the official reading at Bush Intercontinental Airport at the time was 105.
Indeed no major weather station in the Houston area reported such a high temperature at the time. It got TechBlog‘s Dwight Silverman and I wondering what was going on. Where was Apple pulling this data from?

We started speculating on Twitter and didn’t begin to solve the mystery until Travis Tubbs chimed in.
After that Dwight archived the conversation in Storify, and it appears below (above), starting with Dwight’s initial tweet about the temperature getting back to a record 109 degrees Monday. (Officially, it didn’t. Monday’s high topped out at 107.)
…
So the mystery was solved, sort of. Apple gets its weather data from Yahoo!, which in turn gets it from The Weather Channel.
And for whatever reason the default iPhone weather data point is the Houston/Hermann Medical Center weather location. Whatever that is. It’s not an official National Weather Service site.
Full story here
===============================================================
No, it isn’t an official NOAA station, it serves the heliport. But it is a MADIS station, registered with NOAA, and used for other purposes such as MESONET.
Te lat/lon of the station is listed at the Gladstone CWOP metadata site as 29.7140 -95.3950 and that bring up this image on Google Earth:

Clearly the lat/lon places it on the roof in the helipad, but even at max zoom, I can’t make out any weather station. I was however able to see a helicopter on the pad and a windsock on the Bing Maps image and I theorized the weather station might share the mast with the windsock.

Fortunately, certain people like to photograph helicopters in action, and I was able to locate this shot from a photographer’s FLICKR collection that showed the station:
Photograph by Max Tribolet - click to enlarge
If you enlarge the photo, you’ll see the anemometer and wind vane, and what looks like a gill shield for the thermometer, though I can’t be certain. Even if it isn’t, the thermometer will be nearby to serve the helipad.
What I found most interesting though was the temperature analysis provided by the NOAA MADIS website. Apparently the problems with this station are well known.
==============================================================
Temperature




  24 hours
  Day time
  Night time


Average temperature error
-2.7 °F
-4.9 °F
-0.5 °F


Error standard deviation
3.3 °F

Worst average temperature error
-3.8 °F
-6.5 °F
-1.0 °F


Worst standard deviation
4.3 °F
6.2 °F
1.5 °F



NOTE: If the error above is POSITIVE, then it means that the analysis temperature is HIGHER than the reported temperature. This means that your sensor is reading COLDER than expected
================================================================
Worst daytime temperature error of 6.5F …wow.
A look at their graph is also telling:

As is the note below it (red color theirs):
Your readings indicate a solar heating problem. This means that the sun can shine directly onto the temperature sensor (or it’s housing) and increase the temperature recorded significantly. This is often caused by the lack of a radiation shield, or the sensor is poorly sited. For information on radiation shields, see CWOP Radiation Shields, and information on siting, see CWOP Station Guide.
With error magnitudes like that, perhaps the Weather Channel Might want to use a different source of station data for reporting Houston temperatures.
Again, siting is the issue. The station might be fine for reporting helipad conditions, and it might very well be that hot of the roof of that building. Knowing that accurately is important for the safety of the helicrew, especially on days of high humidity and high density altitude that sap rotor lift efficiency.
But it also underscore a point I’ve made time and again: rooftops aren’t a representaive location for climate monitoring, as we’ve seen a couple of days ago with this rooftop GHCN station # 2076548 photographed in Tampico, Mexico:

As we’ve seen time and again, GHCN stations are often sited at airports, and while runway and helipad conditions are imperative to know, especially when they differ from surrounding ambient, such stations sited in odd places don’t translate well for other applications, be it long term climate monitoring or a simple iPhone app for infotainment purposes.
If people reading iPhones can spot such problems and know the temperature data isn’t valid, and a citizen run CWOP program can use MADIS analysis of the data sight unseen and note it’s FUBAR, why can’t our meteorological experts at The Weather Channel figure it out?

Has it really come to this? Newt Gingrich as the conservative alternative to Mitt Romney? That’s what many in the punditocracy have proclaimed as the former speaker of the House has surged recently in the polls.



Yet a look at his record reveals that Newt is hardly the “anti‐​Mitt” — he’s Mitt Romney with more baggage and bolder hand gestures.



Every Gingrich profile proclaims that he’s a dazzling “ideas man,” a “one‐​man think tank.” It seems that, if you clamor long enough about “big ideas,” people become convinced you actually have them.



But most of Gingrich’s policy ideas over the last decade have been tepidly conventional and consistent with the Big Government, Beltway Consensus.





[M]ost of Gingrich’s policy ideas over the last decade have been tepidly conventional and consistent with the Big Government, Beltway Consensus.



Gingrich’s campaign nearly imploded this summer when he dismissed Rep. Paul Ryan’s, R‐​Wis., Medicare reform plan as “right‐​wing social engineering.” But that gaffe was a window into Gingrich’s irresponsible approach toward entitlements.



In 2003, Gingrich stumped hard for President George W. Bush’s prescription drug bill, which has added about $17 trillion to Medicare’s unfunded liabilities. “Every conservative member of Congress should vote for this Medicare bill,” Newt urged.



And in his 2008 book _Real Change_ , he endorsed an individual mandate for health insurance.



In a 2006 piece for _Human Events_ , Gingrich offered House Republicans “11 Ways to Say: ‘We’re Not Nancy Pelosi.’ ” Point seven proposed a Solyndra‐​on‐​steroids industrial policy devoted to “developing more clean coal solutions, investing in a conversion to a hydrogen economy” and more. It’s not clear why the former madame speaker would complain.



It’s also unclear why anybody looking to distance himself from Pelosi would plop down on a love seat with her to call for government action on climate change — as Gingrich did in a 2008 television commercial.



It was a season of bipartisan chumminess for Newt. “Kerry and Gingrich Hugging Trees — and (Almost) Each Other,” the _Washington Post_ described a 2007 global warming event Gingrich headlined with Sen. John Kerry, D‐​Mass.



On foreign affairs, Gingrich’s ideas are a little less conventional, but his apocalyptic saber rattling hardly instills confidence. “We need a calm, reasoned dialogue about the genuine possibility of a second Holocaust,” he told an American Enterprise Institute audience in 2007.



In 2009, he proposed zapping a North Korean missile site with laser weapons. (“Beam me up, Mr. Speaker!” as former Rep. James Traficant, D‐​Ohio, used to say in the ‘90s.)



There’s no denying that Newt is smart, but there’s a zany, Cliff Clavin aspect to his intellect. At times, Gingrich, who’s written more than 150 book reviews on Ama​zon​.com, sounds like a guy who read way too much during a long prison stretch.



The former speaker’s immense self‐​regard is evident in one of the exhibits to a 1997 House Ethics Committee report on him. In a handwritten 1992 note to himself, he wrote: “Gingrich — primary mission, Advocate of civilization, definer of civilization, Teacher of the rules of civilization, arouser of those who fan civilization, … leader (possibly) of the civilizing forces.” Whew!



When he’s not leading the assembled armies of civilization in a Thermopylae‐​style battle against “Obama’s Secular Socialist Machine,” Newt does a little consulting on the side.



In 2009, the ethanol lobby paid his firm $312,000, and in 2006, the former speaker scored a $300,000 fee from Freddie Mac, one of the government‐​sponsored enterprises that helped pump up the disastrous housing bubble.



They sought “my advice as an historian,” Gingrich later explained. (Maybe they were impressed by all those Amazon reviews).



Newt may be a poor fit for the role of “anti‐​Romney,” but you can say one thing for him: He knows how to play the Washington Game.

NOAA INTERACTIVE SEA LEVEL CHART – CLICK HERE
“We have to get used to the idea of a sea level rise of about one meter for this century,“ announced Prof. John Schellnhuber in 2008, based on new findings. Other researchers, based on model computations, even claim 1.5 meters by the end of the century. That of course far exceeds the prognoses of the IPCC. But what does real data tell us?
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has an interactive graphic at its “Sea Levels Online” page that provides the locals trends for sea level rise (see above). You can check the trends based on tide gauges and calculate when Al Gore’s beachfront house will be flooded. Looks like it’s going to take hundreds of years.
At most coastal locations, sea level is rising just 0-3 mm/year, which is 30 cm per century or less, i.e. in the lower range of IPCC forecasts. This is the case for the German North and East Sea coastal areas.

For the German North Sea port-city of Cuxhaven, the rise is approx. 2.5 mm/year. There are areas where sea level is actually dropping.
Interestingly in the northern Adriatic Sea (near Rovinj), sea level rise is a mere 0.5 mm/year, which makes media claims that Venice is sinking into oblivion due to sea climate change pure absurdity. The city is struggling with a sinking ground, and that has little to do with climate.
What’s more, a letter to the editor from EIKE meteorologist/scientist Klaus Eckard Puls appears in today’s daily OstSee Zeitung.
In it he writes about the prophesies of sea level doom and gloom – from the bedwetters, like the PIK, for example – and compares them to reality:
Nature is behaving completely differently from what the prophets would like to have us to believe. Global temperature hasn’t risen in 14 years, and instead even shows a decreasing tendency. Thus the CO2 climate hypothesis is in a free-fall. Moreover, the sea levels, which have been rising for 10 thousand years, show no acceleration whatsoever globally, in stark contrast to the IPCC prognoses. There are many locations where the sea level trend has slowed down, like at the North Sea.”

From the AGU highlights

Despite the fact that average temperatures on land have been increasing from year to year, globally averaged surface temperatures from 2000 to 2010 have shown only moderate warming. This is because sea surface temperatures over the past decade have been flat, if not slightly decreasing. In light of this, scientists are curious about whether this reduced rate of surface warming indicates a reduction of the accumulation of heat in the Earth system over the same period.
Palmer et al. use multicentury climate model simulations to study the relationships among decadal trends in top-of-atmosphere radiation balance (which controls the heat content of the Earth system), ocean heat content, and surface temperature. Consistent with previous studies, they find that all models show large variability in sea surface temperature (SST). This large internal variability in SST could easily “mask the anthropogenic warming signal for a decade or more,” the authors note. By contrast, ocean heat content more closely tracks the radiation budget at the top of the atmosphere, suggesting that measurements of ocean heat to deeper levels would help us monitor climate change more accurately.

Importance of the deep ocean for estimating decadal changes in Earth’s radiation balance
Key Points

Decadal trends in SST place only weak constraint on TOA
As we measure OHC deeper, we gain increasingly good predictions of TOA
Trade-off between measuring longer or deeper for given uncertainty in TOA


Abstract:

We use control run data from three Met Office Hadley Centre climate models to investigate the relationship between: net top-of-atmosphere radiation balance (TOA), globally averaged sea surface temperature (SST); and globally averaged ocean heat content (OHC) on decadal timescales. All three models show substantial decadal variability in SST, which could easily mask the long-term warming associated with anthropogenic climate change over a decade. Regression analyses are used to estimate the uncertainty of TOA, given the trend in SST or OHC over the same period. We show that decadal trends in SST are only weakly indicative of changes in TOA. Trends in total OHC strongly constrain TOA, since the ocean is the primary heat store in the Earth System. Integrating OHC over increasing model levels, provides an increasingly good indication of TOA changes. To achieve a given accuracy in TOA estimated from OHC we find that there is a trade-off between measuring for longer or deeper. Our model results suggest that there is potential for substantial improvement in our ability to monitor Earth’s radiation balance by more comprehensive observation of the global ocean.

"When former Mexican president Felipe Calderon shut down the development of a planned US$2 billion, 4,000 hectare hotel mega-resort in 2012, it looked as though the extraordinary diversity of the Cabo Pulmo National Marine Park had escaped unscathed. But barely a few years later new plans have arisen for the site in the country’s north east after ownership transferred from the now-bankrupt Spanish property company to a Chinese development firm, Glorious Earth Holdings. The planned 22,000-room hotel development on the Baja Californian coastline threatens not just the future of the coral reef, but also those species and habitats on land. Named “Cabo Dorado”, this is the third iteration for a mega-resort on the site. The core of the proposed development is the picturesque beach dunes of Punta Arena, where the desert meets the sea. This is no ordinary sea: Cabo Pulmo National Park is perhaps the world’s most robust marine reserve and coral reef. Legendary underwater photographer and explorer Jacques Cousteau referred to the area as “the aquarium of the world”. So while the significance of the coral reef is well recognised, the biological diversity of Punta Arena and around has remained unknown.  Faced with potential destruction, our internationa team of scientists set about recording the plants and animals in the region, under the umbrella of a US-Mexican collaborative group dedicated to protecting the Sonoaran Desert and led by noted conservationist Exequiel Ezcurra, professor of ecology at the University of California, Riverside. We were alarmed by what we discovered in the heart of the development zone that would be concreted. Published in a recent report, we found 560 types of plants and animals, but also two vegetation types found nowhere else on earth, and two newly described plant species known only from these 11 square kilometres. The sands of Punta Arena feature seasonally flooded lagoons and a thorn desertscrub that, due to the underlying geology, produce wholly unique soils. The plants, Bidens cabopulmoensis, a dune sunflower, and a large shrub, Pisonia calafia, are in serious danger of extinction if this project goes ahead. There are also many endemic species of reptiles, including active sea turtle nests on the beaches. In contrast to our findings, the environmental impact statement (MIA, or Manifestación de Impacto Ambiental) undertaken on behalf of the developers stated there was nothing unique in the area. The MIA omitted 83% of the species found only in the region and nowhere else in the world, recorded 400 fewer plants and animals, and noted only 15 species protected by the Mexican government – compared to the 42 we found. But these concerns are only part of the story. What will the impact of this mega-development be on the remarkable reef-system that is the heart of the region’s ecotourism and fishing industries? Where will the fresh water come from in the middle of this desert? The calculations for the water needed by the proposed development are a source of great concern for local businesses that depend on the aquifer. We need to take a careful look at this kind of large development project. Far too many times along the coasts of Mexico we have witnessed the wholesale destruction of areas of great biological and cultural importance. On the headlands and mangrove estuaries of La Paz, Loreto, and other Baja California coastal cites, biologically important land has been razed for ambitious hotels and apartments, only for these buildings to be subsequently abandoned, to no one’s benefit and at great cost. By incorporating the extraordinary natural wealth of the region into development and building projects we can pursue a much more prosperous vision of the future for  Baja California that matches the grandeur of landscape.  It’s clear the impact this mega-resort would have on local businesses, people and the landscape has not been adequately addressed. For example, the people of Cabo Pulmo – sustained almost entirely by ecotourism – face the imminent loss of the natural resources that provide them a living if the proposal is approved by the Mexican government. In our final report, which we delivered to the environment department of the Mexican federal government, we recommend expanding the Cabo Pulmo National Park to include Punta Arena. The government is expected to make a decision by June 15. Hopefully this scheme can slayed a fourth time, and the area sufficiently protected to prevent it rising again in the future."
"Salmon is not only tasty but is prized for being low fat and high in rich omega-3 oils. In recent times, salmon has been a staple of the national diet, so much so that wild salmon has given way to a huge global farmed industry, worth US$15.4 billion. Salmon are farmed in net pens suspended from floating collars in the sea. Like other types of farming, quality varies and the industry has sometimes come in for criticism over the health and welfare of fish.  Given the size of the market, criticisms have included the amount of wild fish it takes to rear one salmon – if you’re eating farmed salmon for sustainability reasons, for example, you might worry that it takes 1.3kg of wild feed to produce one kilogramme of salmon.  Environmental campaigners have long made the case that the growth of cage farming salmon results in a net loss of fish because they are fed “marine ingredients”, which includes fishmeal (rendered down low-value fish) and increasingly, processing offcuts from the fishery industry – fish oil that is pressed out of the same fish and more specialised high-value protein ingredients. But this aquaculture as a whole is a net producer of marine ingredients. Carps – which make up by far the largest proportion of global aquaculture – are fed diets with little or no marine ingredients. Sometimes they are even cultured using no feed at all, instead relying on the natural productivity of ponds, encouraged by fertilisation. Advances in nutrition, together with a rising price, has also led to a decline in the levels of marine ingredients fed to salmon, with protein and oils replaced by vegetable substitutes such as soy and rapeseed oil.  Between the 1970s and 1990s there was a peak in production of “marine ingredients” – used in trans-fats for margarines, and meals for a wide range of livestock, especially pigs and chickens. But as aquaculture grew fast, more of the global supply of fishmeal and oil was directed to feeding farmed fish and shrimp – an increasingly lucrative market. In 2010, aquaculture was taking around 75% of the global supply.  But the rapid growth in demand for marine ingredients coupled with fluctuating supplies led to price hikes that stimulated the development of alternatives. Comparatively little is now used for pig and chicken diets as companies have become more strategic with their use.  But marine ingredients are still important in maintaining the health of fish in aquaculture, especially in early development. And in the case of salmon, they are important in maintaining the quality of the fish, which provide consumers with high levels of omega-3 fatty acid. Indeed, the fastest growth in marine ingredients sales are for high omega 3 oily capsules, taken as dietary supplements. As farmed fish gets relatively cheaper but the price of marine ingredients to feed them continues to climb, the pressure to find alternatives is likely to continue. Various plant sources such as processed soy and wheat products have emerged as major substitutes for fishmeal but as much of this has to be imported, local alternatives such as field beans are being researched and trialled in Europe. Outside of Europe, it is still very common to use byproducts from livestock production to feed farmed fish in aquaculture diets such as poultry byproducts, which are regarded as a highly nutritious and cheap protein resource.  Replacing marine oils – which are the only source of long chain omega-3 fatty acids – is a bigger challenge. Initiatives such as GM Camelina, a “transgenic” vegetable oil crop created by transplanting marine plankton genes into oil-seed rape, and which could help cut use of marine ingredients as feed, is likely to remain an issue given public acceptance of genetically modified organisms (GMOs).  Major fish stocks used to produce marine ingredients, however, are now subject to much more intense scrutiny, as are the fish farms that use the feeds, which is leading to both better efficiency and practice. The Marine Ingredients Association itself has introduced a certification system for fisheries that produce marine ingredients, and the eco and social certification of farms has created competing bodies such as the Global Aquaculture Alliance and the WWF-inspired Aquaculture Stewardship Council, whose own independent certification schemes have reducing marine ingredients as a central theme. The use of byproducts from sustainable fisheries is also encouraged by all major certification schemes. It is estimated that over a third of the global fishmeal and fish oil supply now comes from byproducts such as herring and other oily fish trimmings.  The potential for increasing the proportion of marine ingredients from these sources is substantial. More than half of a fish often becomes byproduct, and much of this is often wasted. There is also an increased trend towards processed fish in regions, such as in Asia, that have generally preferred to buy whole fish. As demand for farmed fish grows alongside the pressure to limit wild catches, these byproducts will increasingly be required. A combination of market forces, self-regulation and engagement by environmental groups supports the evolution towards more sustainable aquaculture and better managed fisheries. And it is increasingly something consumers can look out for when they are buying fish. Technologies such as Blockchain, linked to QR codes, and databases accessible through apps, will increasingly allow consumers to dig down into ever more detail of how their food is produced."
"Monarch butterflies are known for their striking flame-orange and black appearance, and especially for their mass migration in their millions to spend winters in the mountain forests of Mexico. But despite growing problems with deforestation in Mexico, their struggle begins at home in the United States and Canada. The butterflies that fly to Mexico are the great-great-great grandchildren of the monarchs that were in Mexico the previous winter. In 2013 the overwintering population in Mexico covered 0.67 hectares of fir forest (about 44 million butterflies) the lowest since counts began in 1994. Since 1999 their numbers have declined 82%. What could have caused this? During their larval stage monarchs, which can be found from the US central states to the east coast and into southern Canada, feed exclusively on milkweed plants. We observed in 2001 that many monarchs were feeding on milkweeds in agricultural fields – more than 80% of monarchs from the Midwest. Since then, milkweeds in and around agricultural crop fields have gradually been eliminated, through a combination of spraying with Roundup (glyphosate) herbicide and increased planting of corn and soybeans genetically modified to be resistant to the herbicide.  In previous studies, we’ve shown that the magnitude of monarch population decline in Mexico matched the magnitude of the decline in the abundance of milkweeds in butterflies’ prime breeding habitat – the Corn Belt region of the US. This strongly suggests that milkweed loss is the primary factor in the species’ decline.  In a recently published paper, Tyler Flockhart and colleagues in Canada and Australia examined the monarch population decline and tried to gauge the relative roles of all the factors that may lie behind it. Besides the loss of milkweeds in the breeding area, these include climate change, the loss of forests at the overwintering sites, and occasional catastrophic weather events. The research team developed a population model that incorporated information about birth and death rates for each of the roughly four generations that comprise the monarch annual migration cycle. A number of pieces of information necessary to generate such a population model are unknown or poorly known, so assumptions had to be made. With that caveat, they were able to confirm that the primary driving force behind the population decline was loss of milkweeds in the breeding area, with the other factors playing a minor role. With population models, not only can you examine the past but also extrapolate into the future. The good news is that the population model projects the population to decline by only a further 14% over the next century – much less than the precipitous drop in numbers over the last 20 years. The bad news is that the new, much lower population level makes the species more vulnerable to events such as catastrophic heatwaves or severe winters that can wipe out millions at a stroke. The model puts the chance of population extinction in the next century at a low but distinctly non-trivial 5%. The chief reason why future declines will not be as pronounced is because milkweeds have been virtually eliminated from farmland, meaning that losses stemming from that habitat have already been accounted for. At present there are two main habitats that provide milkweeds for monarch butterflies.  The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) provides incentives to farmers to set aside land from growing crops. This land is typically planted with grasses to prevent erosion but often has milkweeds. I have estimated that there are 1.4m hectares (3.6m acres) of CRP land in the Midwest providing suitable milkweed habitat – if there were incentives for farmers to plant milkweed on their CRP land, this could prevent further declines and even promote a population comeback. Unfortunately at present the high demand for corn means farmers are tempted to convert CRP land back to crops.  The second important habitat is roadsides. Transportation Department officials need to be informed about the impact of roadside management practices, such as spraying with herbicide and mowing, on monarchs. Incentives to plant other flowering species besides milkweed in CRP land and roadsides would help. Pollinators such as bees and butterflies are in serious decline, largely due to loss of habitat. Other threats to pollinators such as the widespread use of insecticides such as neonicotinoids could also be eliminated."
"Around 40% of the global population live in coastal areas less than 100km from the ocean, facing climate challenges such as rising sea levels, heavy rainfall and extreme flooding. This causes loss and damage of US$40 billion annually. According to the UN’s Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, between 2002 and 2012, 700,000 people died, more than 1.4m were injured and about 23m were made homeless as a result of such disasters.  In Bangladesh, some 45m people live in areas where extreme cyclones frequently destroy homes and livelihoods. After interviewing a woman there who lost a child in a flood and was then abandoned by her husband, I wanted to address the problem practically. And that is how Dream Homes, the Dundee University project that has just won the UN’s prestigious Risk Award, was born. In communities that are vulnerable to storm disasters, people have few choices. They are not willing to abandon their homes and move to emergency shelters because they risk losing their livelihood, although often they have no choice if everything is destroyed. Disasters also restrict access to food, water, electricity, and other necessities. So our plan was to design resilient floating homes that would enable families to survive in the aftermath of extreme flooding while producing food, water and energy, and also provide sustainable ways to make a living. We designed and built three 196m2 prototype homes for US$12,000 each in the pilot phase of the project, which was funded by the Global Resilience Partnership in conjunction with the Centre for Climate Change and Environmental Research (C3ER) at BRAC University in Dhaka, Bangladesh.  Crucially, the homes were co-designed by local people in an inclusive effort to empower disadvantaged families. All through the design and construction process we held workshops to find out what people needed most in home that would not sit on land. For adults this included a central “courtyard” space, for example, and for children, a space to play in. Through close collaboration we were able to make the best use of local materials and integrate traditional building methods with our own technologies and innovations. This input not only improved the structural designs but ensured a sense of ownership of the project in local people afterwards. Each home was built over a 40-tonne buoyant platform which acts as a raft, allowing the house to rise vertically above floodwater by sliding on two guideposts. The structure can withstand category three cyclones, medium-level earthquakes and riverbank erosion.  The homes have the capacity to hold 17,000 litres of fresh drinking harvested from rainwater which can supply the domestic water demands of a family for six months. There is room to keep chickens in an enclosure and vegetables can be grown vertically in soil pouches, and in an aquaponic system without soil, so that an income can be earned through selling eggs and produce. An innovative sanitation system called a bio-digestor converts all the waste from the kitchen, toilet and chicken coop to generate methane gas that can be used for cooking fuel. So the home doesn’t pollute the surrounding environment, and good standards of hygiene can be maintained.  The desolate woman who lost her child made me understand how risk evolves from multiple climate disasters and extends suffering through a series of knock on effects. But the problem is not actually risk, but rather the inability to manage risk. Poverty erodes people’s ability to adapt to multiple risks in their lives. Plus diminishing natural resources and social and economic inequalities all serve to increase their vulnerability. Our flood-resilient homes are designed to help people find ways to manage the risks of sea-level rise, storm surge and salinisation (when saltwater intrudes on inland water and soil). These homes will allow people to continue making a living after a flood with adequate access to food, water and energy – the things that enable communities to think beyond immediate survival, continue to make a living and utilise resources to improve their situation.  Above all we understood from our discussions with local people that this should be a home – not a house. Home equals safety, family, the place that provides security, a sense of identity and belonging, and a feeling of pride. For the future we plan to use the €100,000 prize money to bring the project to scale in the flood-prone river basins and deltas of Bangladesh. And we will continue our research to bring the cost down by half, making these sustainable and affordable homes even more accessible to rural communities all around the world."
"Environmentalism can feel like a drag. People trying to reduce their environmental impact often feel stressed and inadequate, and those who aren’t can feel judged and resentful. There are thousands of articles explaining why we need to act. This one is different. As a psychologist who studies motivation and decision making in climate change, I will explain how our negative feelings prevent us from making effective changes, and suggest how a change in perspective could improve the planet and our well-being at the same time. When we learn about damage to the environment, we suddenly have two issues to deal with: the damage itself, and our own feelings about it. When negative, these feelings can have surprisingly large consequences, both for ourselves and the environment. Faced with the scale of environmental challenges, we can often get trapped in two key negative emotions: suffering and regret. When we reflect on climate injustices, and the suffering that will be felt by millions in the coming decades, we often take on suffering ourselves. Stories we tell ourselves about how none of this should be happening, or of how wrong the world is, can yield a sense of powerlessness that is harmful and difficult to avoid. And when we learn that the mechanisms of global warming were well understood in the 1890s and apparent from atmospheric measurements by the 1960s, it’s also natural to feel tremendous regret. It’s vital to understand that these feelings are okay. There is often relief in the mere acknowledgement and acceptance of pain and regret. Give yourself permission to grieve about sinking islands, dying coral reefs, disappearing rainforests, and the fact that all of these were avoidable.

      Heat-tolerant corals can create nurseries that are resistant to bleaching


 The pitfall is staying with these emotions. Lingering suffering and regret can get us stuck in misery, despair, judgement, outrage, or righteousness, all of which can foster inaction. When attempting to cope with our personal suffering and regret, we may forget that engaging in pro-social behaviours focused on others can provide relief. The fix is pleasantly simple. Imagine classifying all events in your life as “over” and “next”. What happened is over. We can accept tragedies and injustices without approving of them. We must look to what comes next, and fight current battles instead of reliving old ones. If you pay attention, it’s amazing how much effort people give to fighting events that have already occurred. What if you’re concerned about the environment, but it seems too hard to make a life change? First, ask yourself whether that change is objectively too hard, or whether it is merely a perception that helps you to manage your suffering and regret. If there’s a conflict between what we think is right and what we see ourselves doing, the easiest solution is to adjust our attitudes and feel like a good person again. But if we can be brave enough to try to change our behaviour, accepting what we failed to do before and what we haven’t done yet, each small step we take can bring ecological and personal benefits. While actions that serve the climate and our communities may seem difficult before we try them, much of that perceived effort lies in the conservative inertia of our current habits, and how much we believe that we can change. For example, I used to drive to most places. I imagined a change to cycling as an inconvenience, as just more work. But once I began cycling to work, it changed my life in unexpected and lovely ways. I’m fitter, more alert, happier, and work more effectively —- as is the case for millions of other cyclists. If cycling were a new drug with the same benefits, it would make the front page of every newspaper. I’m not the best environmentalist, but what I once saw as a difficult sacrifice now seems like an easy change that’s only improved my quality of life. At a societal level, consumerism is depleting nature’s resources and producing unimaginable amounts of waste, too much of which ends up in oceans and landfill. However, consumerist behaviour doesn’t just cause significant harm to the environment — it’s also strongly associated with multiple negative emotions and mental health problems, including anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, and problems with intimacy. These can manifest regardless of age, income, or culture.  Freeing ourselves from consumerism is part of the solution to resolving the climate apathy and disillusionment brought by these emotions. Once we recognise that tying our well-being to possessions is harming both our health and our planet, this liberates us to find solutions. Reaching a new consensus on societal priorities could enable us to create new communities that fulfil and nourish us, and free us to implement the urgent changes needed to transform our relationship with nature. It’s painful to watch our societies pollute land, water, and air. But we have power to combat climate breakdown through politics, diet, transportation, and perhaps most importantly of all: communication. Talk about your struggles with others, and share your victories. Transforming pain into action can be infectious, and together we can still tip the balance.

That a discussion of the pipeline is still consuming government resources some six years after it was originally proposed epitomizes the grand waste of time and money that characterizes the current Administration when it comes to anything it thinks causes dreaded global warming.   
  
In this case, the fault lies squarely with President Obama.   
  
He could have killed the pipeline years ago if he wanted. Or better yet, he could have approved the pipeline years ago and we would now be reaping the benefits of it in whatever form those benefits may have taken (choose your favorites from among the lists that likely includes jobs, tax revenues, lower gas prices, energy security, ally cooperation, etc.).   
  
But he did neither.   




His highest priority seems to be leaving a lasting legacy of “doing something” about climate change. Again, his own EPA should tell him that even if we cut our emissions to _zero_ , today, the amount of warming that would be “prevented” by 2100 is a mere 0.14°C.   
  
And the Keystone XL pipeline is one of his biggest tools to keep planetary warming alive, at least in the media. As long as it is in limbo, people keep talking about it, protestors keep protesting about it, supporters keep lobbying for it, newspapers keep writing about it, and the rest of us are caught up in the spectacle.   
  
The State Department has already found that the environmental impacts and risks from the project are acceptably low. I have already pointed out (to Congress even) the climate impacts of the project are nil. And all the while the Keystone XL pipeline has been delayed, the Alberta tar sands oil production has increased and is in the process of finding other ways onto the global market. Even the Nebraska court case that is often cited by the President as a reason for delaying a decision on the pipeline is more of a procedural issue than a real threat to the pipeline.   
  
At this point, the Keystone XL is just another construction project. In fact, that is all it ever was. If it didn’t require crossing the border with Canada (which required a “presidential permit”), we never would have heard a peep about it.   
  
The _USAToday_ appropriately and succinctly summed up the situation in a recent editorial:   




Keystone is not an existential issue. It's a 1,179-mile oil pipeline in a nation already crisscrossed by more than 150,000 miles of such pipelines. It's long past time to say yes.



Agree completely. It high is time for the federal government to put this issue to rest and get down to issues actually deserving of this much attention (but don’t bet on it!).

"The climate is warming, and so basic logic would suggest we should expect fewer bouts of cold weather. Yet severe winter weather, such as the cold wave over the US this year, and the chilly winter of 2009/10 in the UK have left people questioning this assumption.  In early January 2014, across North America record minimum temperatures for the date were set at many weather stations, including at Chicago O’Hare Airport (-26.7°C, January 6), New York Central Park, (-15.6°C/4°F, January 7) and Washington DC Dulles Airport (-17.2°C, January 7). Daily maximum snowfall records were also broken at several stations. The cold temperatures and heavy snowfall caused widespread disruption to transport and power supply, closure of work places and public services, and damage to crops. Unsurprisingly given the disruption, the national and global media extensively reported the cold wave, including debate on whether or not human-induced climate change was partly responsible. One particular hypothesis garnered a lot of attention: the suggestion that rapid Arctic warming and associated sea ice loss may be increasing the risk of cold extremes.  The theory goes something like this: as the Arctic has warmed more rapidly than places further south, a phenomenon known as Arctic amplification, the north-south temperature gradient has weakened. This temperature gradient powers the jetstream, a strong wind, high in the atmosphere that marks the boundary between cold Arctic air and warmer air to the south. A weaker north-south temperature gradient may cause a weaker jetstream. It’s also argued that a weaker jetstream will meander more, a bit like a river meanders more when the current is slower. When large southward meanders develop, Arctic air pushes south leading to cold conditions. This hypothesis has led to recent claims that Arctic warming will lead to more cold weather. My latest research published in the Nature Climate Change journal, analyses thousands of weather records and suggest a more important – and remarkably simple – connection between Arctic warming and our weather. This link implies the opposite, that rapid Arctic warming will lead to fewer, not more, cold extremes. Generally speaking (in the northern hemisphere), when the wind blows from the north temperatures tend to be colder than average. Conversely, when the wind blows from the south temperatures tend to be warmer than average. Cold extremes, those really cold days, occur most frequently when the wind is from the north. This is no real surprise, as the poles are cold and the tropics and equator to our south are warm.  What the data shows, however, is that days in autumn and winter with northerly winds (blowing from the north) have warmed significantly more than days with southerly winds. The result is a levelling off of temperatures at a new, warmer average as cold days’ temperatures rise towards the temperatures of warm days faster than the warm days themselves increase in temperature. Scientists call this a decrease in temperature variance, and it implies fewer temperature extremes, in this case notably fewer cold extremes. Again, this makes perfect sense if you consider that the Arctic has warmed more rapidly than places further south. Cold northerly winds are not as cold as they were in the past, because the Arctic air they bring is, like the rest of the Arctic, considerably warmer than it once was. The latest climate models suggest that these changes will continue and become more widespread in the future. I examined simulations from 34 different climate models, each run with projected increases in greenhouse gas concentrations. The models all agree that temperatures will warm in all seasons. Towards the pole beyond 40 degrees north, which includes large parts of US, Europe and Asia, temperatures are anticipated to become less variable in all seasons except summer. A warmer and less variable climate has fewer cold extremes.  There is still a lot to understand about how the dramatic changes occurring in the Arctic will affect weather patterns further south – in particular, if and how the jetstream might be affected will be vital. But there is strong evidence that Arctic warming is taking the edge off those cold northerly winds, meaning the risk of extreme cold waves like that experienced in the US becomes rarer still. "
"Among the UK government’s pronouncements for the new parliamentary session were measures designed to boost zero-carbon home building in order to reap the benefits of lower emissions, lower household energy bills, and more comfortable homes. It’s a shame then that the government’s flagship scheme for ensuring existing homes receive energy efficiency upgrades, the Green Deal, is languishing. The Department for Energy and Climate Change had estimated that by 2020 the Green Deal would have helped fund the retrofitting of 14m homes, almost 2m homes per year. But official figures from April 2014 show only 1,178 homes had been refurbished, with another 1,261 in the pipeline. While there have been more than 200,000 Green Deal assessments since the scheme’s start in January 2013, the vast majority of households decided against it, instead taking advantage of funding provided through the Energy Company Obligation (ECO) under which, for those homes that meet the criteria, the bill is picked up by energy supplier companies. So there is no revolutionary upgrade of British homes taking place, and this is reflected in DECC’s estimate that the Green Deal will make up just 1% of predicted energy savings by 2020, as shown in the graph below. In comparison, the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target (the Green Deal’s predecessor) is projected to deliver almost 25% of all savings in 2020. Despite these obvious failings, the government announced substantial cuts to ECO this year, requiring suppliers to deliver significantly less energy efficiency measures. Overall, there are far fewer energy efficiency retrofits taking place than before the Green Deal was introduced, something Dr Nick Eyre from Oxford University and I anticipated two years ago. So where do we go from here? The pay-as-you-save concept of the Green Deal – in which the cost of the loan for energy efficiency improvements is paid for from the monthly savings they provide from household energy bills – is compelling, particularly as it helps to solve the landlord-tenant dilemma where the landlord bears the costs of making improvements, but the tenant reaps the benefits. Governments across Europe were interested to see if it could work in their own countries.  The challenge is to take the best aspects of the scheme and make it work better. In my view, there are three main areas that need to be considered – a new marketing approach, a relaxed golden rule, and a more attractive interest rate. The Green Deal was mainly sold as a means to save households money, but critics pointed out that, as repayments are calculated from estimated rather than actual energy bill savings, they might conceivably be larger than the savings made. A new approach should emphasise the non-financial benefits, such as comfort or adding to the value of the house. For example, in Germany households take out huge loans of up to £60,000 provided by the publicly owned KfW Banking Group. While in most cases the bill savings do not pay back the loan over the time a household occupies the property, the programme has been successful because it is seen as a way of financing home improvements, making houses more saleable, and making people feel more comfortable in their homes. At the heart of the scheme is the golden rule, which stipulates that the cost of the repayments must not exceed the (estimated) energy savings. This implies that the scheme can only finance measures with a relatively short pay-back period – but such measures usually come with moderate up-front costs, and many of these are likely to be financed through ECO in the future. Experience shows that people are most likely to take out loans for measures that have high up-front costs and have long pay-back periods. Proposed changes to ECO will leave significantly less support for more expensive measures such as solid wall insulation, meaning households will have to find other sources of finance for the remaining cost, which may put them off. The newly announced Green Deal Home Improvement Fund provides extra finance in the form of direct grants, but this is a one-off programme with only limited funding available. I don’t think this is a long-term solution. For those households willing to take out loans, even if the costs of repayments are higher than the energy savings, government should relax the golden rule, leading to a wider range of measures being available on the scheme without the need for householders to find additional funding. The interest rate of a Green Deal loan at 7% is deemed commercially attractive against comparable unsecured loans. However, households are more likely to compare the Green Deal interest rate to that of their mortgage, or to high street loans, which means the interest rate needs to be set closer to 3% or less in order to appear attractive.  International experience with low-interest loan programmes has shown that if the interest rate is sufficiently low the market follows – the German KfW loan programme’s interest rate is 1%, for example, and the scheme has been oversubscribed for years. In France consumers have access to a 0% loan scheme for energy efficiency improvements. Establishing such schemes requires considerable public subsidies but research by Ricardo-AEA and others has shown that the Treasury could recoup some or even all of those costs. The Treasury could even end up profiting from the scheme as it is budget positive, creating more revenues and savings than it costs.  It does seem DECC is rethinking the Green Deal, with the new Home Improvement Fund providing attractive incentives to encourage home retrofits. It is a short-term measure but a step in the right direction as high take up in the first week already shows.  Making changes to the scheme quickly has the potential to turn it into a real success story. But if there’s no new deal soon, the Green Deal may not have a long term future."
"**Fort Regent will be used as a Covid-19 vaccination centre to administer Jersey's vaccine programme, the Government of Jersey has announced.**
The leisure centre will be a central hub for islanders apart from care home residents and front-line medical staff.
Care home residents will be the first to be offered the vaccine, which will be administered in the homes via a mobile team.
The initial phase will also be given to all care workers, through Fort Regent.
The order of those to receive a vaccine will be separated into five tiers:
Senior nurse Rebecca Sherrington, who is heading up Jersey's coronavirus vaccine programme, assured islanders the large, open space of the centre will mean the vaccine can be administered safely.
It will be given by registered practitioners including GPs, nurses, paramedics and dentists, who will be provided with training.
Everyone attending Fort Regent will be required to wear a mask and those who are ill will be told not to come, she said.
Mrs Sherrington confirmed Jersey would receive a small number of doses based on the same proportion of population as Guernsey, Isle of Man and four UK nations, which should be sufficient to cover tier one.
There is no set date for the roll out of the programme, but the government is preparing for it to begin by the end of December.
However, this is not definitive as the vaccine's release is subject to safety certification.
Deputy medical officer of health Dr Ivan Muscat assured islanders it will be approved by regulators and safety is the government's highest priority.
He said: ""They are not going to release any vaccine unless they are absolutely certain it is safe.""
The government confirmed Jersey was likely to receive a combination of the Pfeizer and AstraZeneca vaccines, as part of the broader UK order."
"Aberdeen is one of the few cities in the world where your taxi driver is almost guaranteed to know the global market price for oil. It is the second week of March in the capital of the North Sea oil and gas industry and Aberdonians have witnessed one of the sharpest oil price slumps in a generation. The Granite City is still one week away from a market collapse even deeper than the 2016 price crash. “This is a real worry so soon after the last downturn,” one taxi driver says. “It doesn’t take long for people to lose their jobs if the oil price is under $35 [£28] a barrel. Within three or four months of low oil prices contract workers can be out of work. It’s always quicker than you’d think.” A week later oil is trading at about $25 a barrel, wiping billions from the market value of UK oil companies, and an industry report warns that the North Sea oil and gas industry is in a “paper-thin” position. Oil companies are expected to axe their spending plans to weather the latest market rout, which threatens to halve the revenue from the barrels of oil they produce this year. “During the last oil price crash Aberdeen was not ready at all,” says one North Sea veteran. “The city itself completely changed within the space of a few months. Around 150,000 people in the UK lost their jobs, and Aberdeen bore the brunt.” He asks not to be named because after more than 20 years working in the North Sea oil and gas industry he is struggling to find work. In recent days a verbal job offer from one North Sea firm was rescinded and an interview with another cancelled. Employers have brought in hiring freezes across the city and recruiters have scrapped their meeting schedules for the next few weeks. This disquiet is still fresh in the city’s collective memory. The last oil market downturn was deeper and longer than any oil market rout in history, lasting from late 2014 to its nadir at $28 a barrel in the first weeks of 2016. It was punctuated by about 150 North Sea job losses a day and a string of bankruptcies. At its depths property prices in Aberdeen plummeted and mortgage arrears spiralled to double the national level. “The last downturn was a tough one for the city,” says Derek Leith, a senior partner at EY’s Aberdeen office. “But what it meant was that Aberdeen began to think very seriously about the fact that eventually the era of oil and gas will come to an end and the city needs to be famous for doing something else. “There’s been a lot of effort to change the trajectory to make Aberdeen a centre for energy, rather than of oil and gas. The idea is to use the city’s existing skills and pivot towards renewables and other clean energy sources,” he says. As the UK moves towards a net-zero carbon future many have questioned whether there can still be a place for the UK’s ageing oil industry. Now, a green future might be Aberdeen’s best bet for a long-term future. “If you were to ask a dyed-in-the-wool Aberdonian who has worked in the oil industry for the last 20, 30 years whether they are interested in climate action they would probably only go along with it as long as it didn’t impact their livelihoods,” the North Sea veteran says. “These same people are realising that renewables might just save them.” Sir Ian Wood is one such convert. During the North Sea’s boom years in the 1970s and 80s the billionaire oil tycoon used the UK’s lead in offshore oil and gas to transform his modest family firm, Wood Group, into one of the world’s largest oil engineering companies. Today, he believes the city that ignited the world’s dependence on fossil fuels believes it may hold the answer to tackling its consequences. Wood set up Opportunity North East as oil prices tumbled in 2015. His threefold plan to rebalance the region’s economy recasts the offshore heritage and engineering legacy of the north-east of Scotland as a vital advantage in building a greener economy. First, accelerate the offshore wind boom, including a new generation of floating wind farms. Next, use this abundant clean energy to siphon off the carbon from hydrocarbon gas, in a process known as steam methane reforming, to produce clean-burning hydrogen for transport fuels and industry. Finally, store the leftover carbon “waste” from this process beneath the seabed to prevent it contributing to rising global temperatures. “This all sounds very glib,” Wood says. “It will take, in my opinion, 10 to 15 years to get this right. Once we have it, we will be able to sequester quite a lot of carbon emissions.” Getting it right would also secure a route to market for North Sea gas and a place for Aberdeen at the centre of the UK’s hydrogen economy. The city has already taken steps to lay claim to a green future, including the establishment of the Net Zero Solution Centre, a hub of green tech innovation within the Oil and Gas Technology Centre (OGTC), which could one day export low-carbon energy solutions globally. Colette Cohen, the chief executive of the OGTC, says leading oil companies are beginning to take meaningful steps towards complying with the UK’s legally binding climate targets, but the oil price collapse has raised doubts. “When we were first set up three years ago the industry was still struggling against the last oil market downturn,” she says. “When we were talking about what their carbon footprint would look like in the next decade, companies were saying: ‘I may not exist then, it’s really financially challenging right now.’” In the last year, there has been a palpable shift within the industry, she says, but the latest market crash “has to be a concern” for future green investments. “Everything around net zero costs money. If oil companies are backed into survival mode their ability to spend any spare cash on future-proofing their operations becomes more difficult.” Leith believes the latest crash may be enough to convince companies that investing in clean energy alternatives and “survival mode” are not mutually exclusive. “There are always some who would prefer to batten down the hatches and hope for an upturn in oil prices so that they can go back to what they regard as normal. If anyone is still under that misconception then the last few weeks should have put that to bed,” he says. • This article was amended on 30 March 2020. An earlier version incorrectly referred to an “electrolyser machine” as removing carbon from hydrocarbon gas; this is actually done through a process called steam methane reforming."

I’m here to help you right-wing, nut-job, conspiracy-theory, alternative-fact, tin-hat wearing deplorables because, believe me, you need it.



We at _Stuff_ , the saviours of the entire huperson race, have declared a Climate Emergency and you people don’t appear to be taking it seriously, at all. Shame on you. Now, thanks to you fossil-fuel fan-girls and boys the ARCTIC IS ON FIRE!!! Did you hear me? THE ICE is ON FIRE!!! All thanks to you and your global warming. 



See what you’ve done, are you happy now?



Ha! “It’s the opposite of hell freezing over”. When are you folks going to grow up, accept some culpability for this overheated planet, and take some responsibility? For heaven’s sake, get with our noble cause before it’s too late!



What’s that, I hear you say? ‘Fires in the Arctic Circle forests are not at all unusual.’ Well; that’s true, but we clearly state that fact in the body of the story so it’s only the headline that’s entirely misleading…we stand by the article. 



Next? ‘It’s not a satellite image’? Well, the article says it’s a satellite image, yes, but, okay – it’s not, fair point. It’s not a satellite image; it’s representative, it’s to invoke a reaction from simpletons that refuse to follow our superior moral imperatives for whatever reason [snort]. 



What’s that? ‘There’s no smoke, it’s cloud, there is no fire’…oh, oops – see reasons above. 



Next?… It’s not recent, the photo is thirty-seven years old, and it’s doctored…it’s a crop from an image depicting an oil tanker being loaded’. No, no, I assure you, we would never use a picture of anything oily unless of an Albatross, dyed and sad-faced. You have proof?…



Oh dear [sigh]! Okay, that’s it, I can only take one more criticism of our wonderful story…you, sir; what would you like to point out? 



Oh…! Valdez, Alaska, is not even in the Arctic Circle? Are you kidding me?…No, you’re not; ‘It’s nearly 500 kilometres below it’…Uhm, well…that’s the latitude quality journalism allows us, that’s all I want to say. So, ok, ok: 



But, apart from that, do you fossil-fools believe us now? Like we said at the outset: It’s a crisis, a real Climate Imagineracy. Please take us much more seriously going forward.

Share this...FacebookTwitterEurope, and especially authoritarian Germany, has passed numerous measures over the years to get people to change their behavior – all to protect the climate.
But the efforts are failing says a new Enquete Commission report to be issued Monday by the German Federal Parliament, and so its authors are now calling for more radical measures to curb the impact of human activity on the planet. The influential commission includes members from every party.
Latest Enquete report of global doom and gloom
The report was drafted by the Parliamentary Enquete Commission, which includes green enviro-zealots like Hermann Ott (Parliamentarian, Green Party) and Michael Müller (Parliamentarian, Socialist Party).
Ott writes that “technical solutions alone are not adequate” and thus proposes the implementation of consumption limits, and making energy and raw materials more expensive. The project group which wrote the report, according to Ott, says “global concepts for curbing the consumption of raw materials are essential”.
According to Ott, his team “has reached the worrisome conclusion that the ecosystem being overburdened is not something on the horizon, but has already occurred in some areas – and is already shown by climate change, species extinction and the burdening of natural cycles by excessive nitrogen fertilization. […] According to the consumption of resources and the pollution of the environment, 1.3 to 1.5 Earths are needed.”
Moreover, the Parliamentarians are calling for “a price signal”. They say that up to now the “atmosphere and oceans have had no price”.
Technology has failed to cut CO2 emissions
The report also finds that green products and technology will not solve our climate problems because of the so-called “rebound effect”. As new technology makes many things more energy-efficient, people just end up consuming more energy because they just run their appliances longer. For example energy saving lights require only a few watts, and so people now leave the lights on more longer. People also feel less bad about driving their hybrid car. In some cases, there’s the so-called “back-fire effect”, where the technology ends up causing more consumption and not less!
Therefore the report hints that far more drastic behavior control measures will be needed. Hello tyranny, size XL!
We’re headed for “self-destruction”
The online daily Die Welt quotes green leftist Michael Müller: “One of the findings of the report is that extending today’s trends leads to self-destruction. We have to fundamentally change our thinking.”

What Müller means here is that citizens need to ignore the scientific data and become as neurotically paranoid and obsessed with the end of the world as he himself is.
Müller is also the Chairman of the umbrella environmental organization Umweltverbandes Naturfreunde Deutschland (Environmental Association of Nature Friends Germany). He is also a contributor to the alarmist climate site “Klimaretter” (Climate Rescuers), and so fancies himself as a planet-saving hero.
Another challenge for climate and environmental protection, the report says, is that developing countries are striving to reach western levels of prosperity and are therefore consuming more and more resources. It seems this is now becoming intolerable for green neurotics.
It used to be that poverty and lack of development were the ills of the planet – now they are the ills of the planet.
Green tyranny gets a stern signal from the US Senate
Meanwhile the US Senate just sent a powerful signal to the enviro-kooks in Europe, which boil down to something like: Take your paranoid fear-mongering obsessions and stuff them. Indeed most of the world is pleased to hear that the Senate “unanimously passed a bill on Saturday that would shield U.S. airlines from paying for their carbon emissions on European flights, pressuring the European Union to back down from applying its emissions law to foreign carriers.”
John Thune:
The Senate’s action today will help ensure that U.S. air carriers and passengers will not be paying down European debt through this illegal tax and can instead be investing in creating jobs and stimulating our own economy.”
Claire McCaskill
It’s refreshing to see strong, bipartisan support for the commonsense notion that Americans shouldn’t be forced to pay a European tax when flying in U.S. airspace.”
Glad to see the US politicians are working to serve the people, and not the other way around, as is obviously the case in Europe.

Share this...FacebookTwitterOnline news weekly FOCUS reports on the overnight damage from Germany’s record March cold with the headline this morning:
100-year event in March –
 Greenland icy air smashes cold records in the East
Cold records were set during the night at many locations in the eastern part of Germany. “The windchill pushed felt-temperatures down to – 30°C.”
Readings of -13°C to – 16°C were recorded at a number of locations at elevations above 1000m. “For the last 10 days of March, this has not happened in decades. Such masses of cold air do not reach Germany even in the dead of winter in some years,” FOCUS writes.
Because some stations in Germany have been keeping weather records for as long as 300 years, e.g. Dresden, Braunschweig and Potsdam, “scientists consider it appropriate to call it an event of the century,” FOCUS reports.
The bitter cold is exacerbated by strong, gusty winds blowing from Russia. With the wind, “temperatures felt like -23°C in parts of of the East on Sunday morning. On the Brocken in Harz the windchill was -33°C.”
Wetterkontur.de provides a list of some of the overnight lows recorded early this morning.
FOCUS quotes Eva Willa of the German Weather Service (DWD) in Potsdam this morning:

For the end of March, Brandenburg has never been so cold since the beginning of temperature measurements.”
“Coldest March in 100 years”
Online Bild newspaper this morning interviewed five experts: Thomas Marschall, Dominik Jung, Dr. Henning Baberg, Lars Lachmann und Thomas Endrula.
Endrula: “We are now experiencing the coldest March in 100 years.”
Not only has the winter been cold and dark, but it has also been a long one. Jung: “It was very long, the first snow arrived at places already at the end of October.”

"When news of the pandemic broke in California and we were ordered to shelter at home, many of us rifled through our closets for our bulk packages of protective N95 masks that we’d worn in last year’s fire, and the fires the year before that, and the fires the year before that, and wondered if we should donate them to the hospitals or keep them for ourselves. This time, wearing masks was about protecting the vulnerable and at-risk from ourselves. But we will need the masks to protect ourselves from the fires that will likely come back this summer and fall. Presumably, there won’t be any N95 masks left by that time, when we’ll need protection from the smoke if we’re ordered to evacuate, as we had to last year, for more than a week, when the Kincade fire scorched 77,758 acres of our county of Sonoma.  In 2018, fires burned nearly 2 million acres in California. And in 2017, fire charred through a significant portion of my hometown. When the university where I teach recently closed for the semester because of shelter-at-home orders, it was the fourth closure in three years (the other three due to fires or smoke from fires). You could hear the weary tone in the administrators’ emails, thanking us for being attentive, yet again, to the needs of our traumatised students. During the first disorienting week of shelter at home, we whispered to our climate emergency friends: “Psst! Isn’t this what we’ve been hoping for? The sudden reduction in air travel? The shrinkage in fossil fuel emissions? Did you hear greenhouse gases dropped 25% in China during February? And people are taking online classes in carbon sequestration gardening techniques? And that judge finally cancelled a key permit for the Dakota Access pipeline?” It felt, at first, like some sort of divine intervention. I couldn’t get the Anna Akhmatova poem out of my head: “Everything is plundered, betrayed, and spent / the wings of black death have flown by / why, then, do we feel so radiant?” In any case, this stay-at-home remedy for the pandemic was a far superior experience to what we go through during fires. We could breathe fresh air! At least, those of us who didn’t have the virus. But as the reality of the economic toll set in, as well as the realisation that Donald Trump was using this opportunity to roll back more environmental restrictions, and realised that marginalised people were the ones dying in largest numbers, it became evident that there was no real silver lining. All around were the same symptoms of a system heading in the wrong direction. One student wrote to me: “I’m looking forward to things getting normal again.” The only problem is that things weren’t normal before. And when the winds pick up this October, electricity and gas provider PG&E will, most likely, turn off the power for one, two or maybe more weeks to try to avoid another catastrophic conflagration due to a drought-diseased tree crashing onto a live power line and burning up the region. If we are still sheltering at home, no power means no internet, no Zoom, no Netflix. More importantly, when the fires come, where and how will we evacuate while physical distancing? After the fires, any illusions we had held that humanity could triumph over nature came apart. When Covid-19 erupted, it felt a little like a “Hold my beer. We’ve got this!” kind of moment, not because we had any control – quite the opposite – but because we’d had an apprenticeship with our own powerlessness against the forces of nature. But that powerlessness realigns us to the patterns of a more profound reality than our own. I’m deeply heartened, even astonished by the unprecedented rising global solidarity, this communitas, in response to the pandemic, and what it promises we are capable of. It’s too soon to measure how this global pause will affect global greenhouse emissions. Early estimates predict a 5% decline this year, but short of the 7.6% needed every year for 10 years to limit warming to 1.5C. Clearly this stay-at-home method, leading to a potential economic collapse, isn’t the best way to bring down emissions. Others have written convincingly how a New Green Deal makes more economic sense than trying to prop up a collapsing fossil fuel industry, how, in the US, 5.2m permanent clean-energy jobs could replace the 2.2m fossil-fuel job loss. Having said that, I think we have put too little emphasis protecting the planet by understanding, honouring, and facilitating its life-sustaining processes and carbon sinks. Perhaps staying home gives us some time to observe these processes. We must stay six feet apart from each other, but not from the Earth. • Christina Nichol is the author of the novel Waiting for the Electricity. She lives in northern California"

New Study in Nature: East African Drought Trend Part of a Natural Cycle
By Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated, edited by P Gosselin)

East Africa has gotten drier over the last decades, suffering from drought. Those responsible for this misery were quickly found: It had to be man. His rising CO2 emissions must have irreversibly damaged the East African climate, and driven the rains off for good. This is pretty much how many environmental and aid organizations have been arguing, e.g. Aktion Deutschland Hilft or Greenpeace. Of course, you don’t have to be a marketing expert or psychologist to see the real intentions of these accusations. With feelings of guilt, donations come pouring in.
Now a new publication in the journal Nature casts serious doubt on the supposed man-made East African drought assumption. US scientists from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, led by Jessica Tierney, have taken a closer look at moisture trends in East Africa and have uncovered a surprise. Using geological reconstructions, the scientists were indeed able to confirm that East Africa has dried out during the past decade. However, the group also succeeded in reconstructing the data all the way back to the year 1300 (See Figure 1 above).
As Figure 1 shows, the drought of the last decade is simply all part of a broader natural cycle that has been occurring over hundreds of years. Contrary to what was assumed earlier, the drying out did not first begin in the second half of the 20th century, but already at the end of the 18th century. A pronounced wet period prevailed in East Africa between 1680 and 1765 (Figure 1), which corresponds to the Little Ice Age – a time when global mean temperature was more than 1°C colder than today. Interestingly, East Africa was just as dry back in the 14th and 15th centuries as it is today. Clearly CO2 could not have been responsible for that.
Therefore Jessica Tierney and her team started looking for a natural driver for East Africa’s moisture development. They compared the drought data with the temperature development in the Indian Ocean. Lo and behold: both curves showed a high degree of similarity. Obviously the rain in East Africa is driven significantly by the Indian Ocean. Whenever the India Ocean is cool, the rains in East Africa increase. And when the Indian Ocean is warm, the rains become more seldom (see Figure 2):

In turns out that the temperature curve of the Makassar Strait near Indonesia also closely reflects global mean temperature (Figure 3). During the Medieval Warm Period and the Modern Warm Period, drought conditions prevailed in East Africa. But wet conditions ruled during the Little Ice Age. We also know that this climatic behavior over decades and centuries happens to follow solar activity. Thus moisture development in East Africa is mainly driven by solar activity.
Unfortunately the authors of this Nature study “forgot” to mention it – even though it’s made obvious by the data. The results are no surprise because numerous other studies from different parts across the world show the same distinct patterns, for example: here, here, here, and here, just to name a few from many.

==================================
“It’s getting colder because it’s getting warmer” – The meteorological illusory world of the climate alarmists
By meteorologist Klaus-Eckart Puls
European Institute for Climate and Energy
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
Cartoon right: www.cartoonsbyjosh.com
For more than 10 years Germany and large parts of Europe have been seeing a trend to colder winters with considerable phases of snow and cold, especially over the last five winters. This is in stark contradiction to the established climate science. For example in 2000 we heard from IPCC climate scientist and lead author Mojib Latif: “Winters with strong frost and lots of snow like what we saw 20 years ago will no longer exist at our latitudes”.
Today in 2013 we are seeing harsher winters persisting until the end of March! This is an embarrassing calamity for German climate alarmists, who 2 years began concocting a meteorologically adventurous hypothesis in an attempt save face. The alarmists:
“The Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research now sees the harsh winters as being a consequence of global warming, which now causes icy winds in the Arctic to find their way unobstructed to Europe because of climate change.”

Let’s look at the facts.
The winters in northern and central Europe have been cooling for more than 10 years, Fig. 1:

Fig. 1: Germany’s temperature anomaly trend for (DJF) winters over the last 16 years shows a cooling of 2°C. Chart source: EIKE (Josef Kowatsch), data from the German Weather Service (DWD).
This cooling trend is also observed in the mean annual temperature values, globally (stagnation) [2], as well as in Germany:

Fig. 2: Germany’s mean temperature trend has been falling sharply over the last 15 years. (Source Josef Kowatsch, data from German Weather Service).
The climate models had predicted nothing of the sort. Especially embarrassing is that 10 years ago we heard in interviews with leading climate scientists and read statements like the following [3]:
“Good-bye winter: Never again snow? In Germany cold winters are a thing of the past.”
Today nature is contradicting the model projections for annual and wintertime temperatures. And now, after the fact, the alarmists are busy concocting dubious explanations. The Alfred Wegener Institute [4]:
The model calculations show that atmospheric pressure difference is weakened by minimal Arctic sea ice cover later on in the winter and thus cause the Arctic cold to move all the way down to middle latitudes.”
From a meteorological standpoint, there’s a lot to be said about that:
(1) Proof that winter weather in one region can be derived from the earlier summertime weather of another region has yet to be found by the generations of meteorology! If it were the case, the problems of longer-term seasonal forecasts would be finally solved.
Even the climate alarmists are publicly skeptical of their new “silver bullet” science, and deeply so. Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) scientist Ralf Jaiser added: “Of course a great number of other factors play a role in our complex climate system that at times overlap each other. […] Other mechanisms are for example related to snow cover in Siberia or to tropical influences. The interrelationships between these factors of influence are subjects of future research work and thus remain factors of uncertainty for forecasts.“
PIK scientist Gerstengarbe also added [5]:
The studies of this development are ongoing, and so at the moment no conclusions can be made on whether or not Central Europe will have the ‘pleasure’ of cold easterly winds more frequently.”
In a nutshell, nobody knows anything for sure. Yet, the chattering elite media now have more climate-catastrophe fodder for their dependably gullible readers, at least through Easter.
(2) If the new alarmist hypothesis were conclusive, then we should have seen mostly cold winters for the last 20 years, because this is a time period where we have seen relatively little Arctic sea ice cover in the summertime (see Fig. 3):

Fig. 3: Arctic sea ice area, [6].
However, we only have seen a higher frequency of cold, snowy winters only over the last five years.
Here the alarmists are playing it on the safe side and are not mentioning one certain aspect: After the annual summertime minimum, the ice area always recovers over the following winter (Fig. 3) and reaches the long-term mean value (currently it is slightly above normal). Lots of ice “generates” lots of cold air, which at times plunges down into Central Europe due to the stochastic cycles of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). And sometimes it does not (see Fig. 4). To this day there is no correlation whatsoever between NAO with CO2.
Our winter weather is still always made in the winter, and there is absolutely no evidence for claims to the contrary!
(3) The decisive argument against the new “Warm-Cold-Hypothesis” is as follows:
If this hypothesis were scientifically, or at least statistically conclusive, then the NAO index (air pressure difference between Iceland and the Azores) over the last 30 years would have been negative for the most part. However, the exact opposite is the case, see Fig. 4:

Figure 4: NAO Index. Positive index leads to warmer European winters (westerly winds), negative index to colder winters (blocking).
NAO Index 1982 – 2012
 Positive: 22
 Negative: 7
 Neutral: 1
Over the last 5 years we’ve had cold winter-phases with snow and blasts of cold air when the NAO index was positive as a whole. Thus, in contradiction to the claims of the climate alarmists, the cold air of this winter, as was the case in the last winters, did not come at all from the north from (the Arctic), but rather mainly from the icy east winds from Russia and Southern Scandinavia.
That alone suffices to refute the crude claim: “Our winters are getting colder because the summers in the Arctic are geting warmer.”
The Weltwoche [8] from Zurich quotes PIK scientist Stefan Rahmstorf: “The ice free areas of the oceans act like heaters as the water there is warmer than the Arctic air above. This produces more ideal conditions for high pressure systems that steer cold air to Europe.”
This completely contradicts meteorological and textbook knowledge: High pressure systems are not created above warm water – low pressure systems are. Classic examples are tropical storms.
Moreover, the Arctic is not made up of ice-free areas, but of ICE. This is true today (Fig. 3).
Again quoting Stefan Rahmstorf: . “…oceans act like heaters because the water there is warmer than the Arctic air above.. This produces more ideal conditions for a high pressure system…” The exact contrary is stated in meteorological textbooks:
The wintertime static cold highs form above cold, snow-covered ground. A classic example are the annual(!) wintertime cold highs over Siberia and Russia.”
In other words: Such a high cannot form over “warm” Arctic water. Exception: it occurs dynamically through convergences in planetary waves in the middle atmosphere. But such highs are, as a rule, not very stationary. Moreover, the (more seldom) thermically static highs on the other hand are very much so. This 2012/13 winter proves it with its constantly re-generating cold highs over Scandinavia Russia, which went on for months.
In the meantime some media outlets [9] have begun to notice that the explanations on these developments coming from the established climate science institutes are in stark contradiction to their models, and have appeared after the fact:
“…are three cold winters…coincidental?” … “Such winters are incomnvenient not only for those who freeze in the, but also for those who earlier projected warmer temperatures because of CO2 emissions.” … “The reality is, writes American climate scientist JUDAH COHEN, that we are freezing not despite climate change but because of it” … “But such an explanation would be convincing if it had not come after the fact. Instead the exact opposite had been announced for decades.”
Some media outlets are becoming distrustful as a result of these contradictory claims, as the following headlines show:
“Climate prognoses under scrutiny; extreme cold in March: Is global warming leading the a new ice age?” [10], or:
“Wissenschaftler warnen vor Eiszeit” [11]
We’ll have to wait and see. But in the meantime, it looks like global warming is over! [12]

"Over recent decades, scientists have watched the Arctic and Antarctic polar regions respond in starkly different and perhaps surprising ways to the effects of increasing human influence on the Earth’s climate.  Whereas the Arctic has warmed far more than any other region and has steadily lost sea ice, Antarctica has cooled in most places and gained sea ice. Any hope of predicting the fate of these environmentally critical regions rests on understanding the elemental processes behind this polar climate conundrum. In a paper published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society journal we lay out a framework for the response of polar environments to the effects of human-induced changes to the climate. The predominant factors are the ever-increasing concentration of greenhouses gases in the atmosphere and the ozone hole over Antarctica caused by an abundance of chlorofluorocarbons, which peaked at the turn of the century and are now slowly diminishing. On account of its ability to absorb and transport enormous amounts of heat, the ocean also plays an outsized role in climate change and is an important factor in the explaining the asymmetric response of the north and south poles to the changing climate.  In our computer simulations of the ocean and climate, the excess heat from greenhouse gases is absorbed into the ocean around Antarctica and in the North Atlantic. The heat does not stay in place but instead is carried around by the moving ocean. In the Southern Ocean around Antarctica, currents draw heat towards the equator, away from the pole.  Meanwhile in the North Atlantic, ocean currents carry excess heat poleward towards the Arctic. So while Antarctica warms little, or even cools, the Arctic Ocean’s temperature increases to such an extent that heat is actually lost to the atmosphere over the Arctic. This clearly reveals the differing responses to greenhouse gases in each region, with the Arctic warming more than twice as rapidly as the Antarctic. By mid-century, the Arctic may have warmed so much that summers could have no sea ice at all. As for the ozone hole over Antarctica, scientists have only recently started to quantify the impact of ozone depletion and recovery on the surface climate. When we introduced an ozone hole into our model, the winds over the Southern Ocean grew faster. This intensification of winds initially triggers a rapid cooling of the sea surface and expansion of sea ice, but this is followed by a slow process of warming and sea ice contraction. We think this warming happens because the stronger winds eventually dredge up to the surface warm waters from the deep ocean.  Our calculations suggest that around Antarctica the ozone hole may have delayed warming due to greenhouse gases by several decades. It’s tempting to speculate that this is the period through which we now find ourselves passing. By mid-century, however, ozone hole-effects may instead be adding to the warming around Antarctica, but with diminished amplitude as the ozone hole heals. When we bring our results together, an interesting picture emerges of the combined effect of greenhouse gases and the effects of the ozone hole on climate at the poles. It may be that the slight cooling currently measured around Antarctica today is a consequence of the cooling effects of the ozone hole. But as the century proceeds, both these human-induced effects on the climate may combine with the effect of warming waters around Antarctica with worrying but uncertain effects on Antarctic sea ice, glaciers and sea-level rise."
"It was inspiring to read about the launch of Waitrose’s trial in Oxford offering consumers a range of products free of packaging. Their system isn’t revolutionary – smaller supermarkets have been doing the same thing for quite some time, as have many committed people. But it’s the first time that a major supermarket has made a big move away from the packaging-dependent model that has dominated major supermarkets for years. Waitrose’s system, where customers can fill their own reusable containers with an array of food, alcohol and cleaning products, reminds me of time spent with my grandparents in Kent as a child. We would walk into Walderslade village and visit a shop to purchase custard powder, flour and cereal – packaging free. Barrels were lined up next to each other inviting you to scoop out, weigh and pay for as much as you needed. Growing up in the rationing era of World War II, my grandparents taught me a valuable lesson in trying not to waste a thing. Back then, there was no option to purchase products in the packaging we struggle to imagine living without. For now, Waitrose is still giving customers the choice to purchase as normal – which is why we must consider this momentous announcement as just the start of a seismic shift towards supermarkets that allow consumers to shop with the health of the planet in mind. The first key step towards this vision is widening the packaging-free philosophy to all stores of all the major supermarkets, and, crucially, not giving consumers who might resist change the option to stick with the polluting packaged goods that feel so familiar. This means switching to dispenser systems wherever possible – not just for peanuts and pasta, but for things like drinks and toiletries too. As well as protecting the planet, innovative reuse and refill schemes have the potential to save billions in packaging costs, which could be passed to consumers. Other foods are more complicated. In extending the shelf life of fresh produce, plastic massively reduces food waste, which produces methane if it goes to landfill. Bioplastics are an option, but would require vast amounts of land if widely used, and they currently contaminate fossil-fuel plastic recycling streams at great cost. Governments and supermarkets will therefore need to work together to drastically improve national recycling and food waste systems, so that shifts in packaging help rather than harm the environment. On food waste, France has shown how quickly change can be implemented. In 2016, the country banned supermarkets from throwing away food and forced them to sign donation contracts with charities. Of course, the buck doesn’t stop with supermarkets – most food waste is generated at home. Supported by government collections of food waste, consumers must try to buy only what they will eat, and compost what they don’t. And in cases where shelf life is significantly improved, sticking with plastic may be the best thing for the planet – so long as we improve our abysmal recycling rates.

 Beyond this are a number of other radical but vital steps supermarkets of the future could take to become bastions of environmental protection. First, celebration of the seasons and local produce. Its true that locally grown fresh produce doesn’t automatically have a lower carbon footprint than food flown in from far-flung fields, thanks to varying growing practices and weather conditions. For example, tomatoes imported to the UK from Spain produce lower emissions than British tomatoes, which require heated greenhouses. But perhaps the solution isn’t to buy Spanish or British tomatoes, but reconnect our eating habits with what grows naturally in which country we live. The vast majority of people would not be able to tell you in what month broccoli sprouts or mushrooms mature, or whether they even grow in their country. Simple changes like organising aisles according to geography and showcasing local community food growers could transform the way we see food. Reorienting our consumption around what’s seasonal and local could reduce our dependence on air miles and energy-intensive growing practices, support a greater connection to the land that grows the food we depend upon, and restore supermarkets as the community hubs they once were Finally, supermarkets must as a matter of urgency introduce a grading system that identifies each and every product’s environmental impact across its life cycle. The serious challenge of making often complex product supply chains transparent needs to be overcome before a labelling system can be truly effective, but focusing efforts on this is an important aim in itself, and one that supermarkets have a responsibility to lead on. Denmark’s government has already announced that it will work with supermarkets to place stickers on all food products that clearly indicate their carbon footprint. Hopefully, other countries will soon follow.

 Such a labelling system would not only accelerate the shift away from known harmful products like beef, but address confusion surrounding newly popular vegan products that are also damaging for the environment, such as almond milk, which among other things requires vast amounts of water to produce. Chile’s radical new food labelling aimed at reducing the country’s obesity crisis has already made a difference to eating habits, and the environmental movement would do well to take note. Waitrose’s efforts to eliminate plastics and packaging should be celebrated – but it is just the start of what needs to be done across society to address the climate and ecological crises. With a little inspiration from the past, and some imagination for how to overcome the new challenges of the current age, we can start to feed the planet’s inhabitants without hurting its ecosystems or climate.

"**""It was pretty grim. There was a lot of sadness in people's eyes. A lot of fear of the unknown.""**
Matt Lanigan is describing life on Melbourne's Chapel St during the city's recent four-month lockdown.
""The streets were completely deserted. It was like something out of [post-apocalyptic film] Mad Max,"" says Mr Lanigan, who owns cafe Lucky Penny on the iconic shopping strip.
Melbourne first went into lockdown in March, but its second, which began in July after a fresh Covid outbreak, was a bigger blow. That lockdown went on to become one of the longest and strictest in the world.
""It was brutal,"" Mr Lanigan says of trying to keep his business afloat. ""It was like I was in a boxing match and I just got knocked to the floor. For a moment there, I felt like maybe it wasn't worth getting up.""
But things are slowly turning around. On Friday, Melbourne and the state of Victoria achieved one measure of ""elimination"" of the virus - 28 consecutive days with no new infections. After seeing daily cases soar above 700 in July and August, the city is seen as an example for the rest of the world on how to handle a second outbreak.
Now on reopened Chapel St, music and chatter fill the air as people enjoy their Sunday brunches. Customers are coming in and out of shops on both sides of the road. The scene is very Melbourne.
Despite the high spirits, everywhere you look there are signs of how battered this city has been.
Many businesses are still shut, some displaying ""for lease"" signs. Others are open but half empty. Placards saying ""support local"" dot Melbourne.
Not far from Chapel St, Melissa Glentis runs a cafe called Dilly Daly.
""Most of Melbourne was feeling just crushed,"" she says. ""Our spirits were crushed, the streets were dead. I didn't actually want to come to my own business, which I've worked [on] my entire life to get to this point.
""It was a roller coaster of emotions. There were days where we just didn't want to get off the couch. I just wanted to stay home and cry.""
The lockdown divided the city between those who supported it and those who said it was too extreme and too long.
The huge public health benefit has also come at a huge cost. Melbourne's economy could be reduced by up to A$110bn (Â£60bn; $81bn) over the next five years because of the pandemic. Victoria is projected to lose up to 325,000 jobs this year alone, according to a report by the City of Melbourne.
Mr Lanigan says his business barely survived - he offered takeaway services, created an online grocery store, and took up a government subsidy called JobKeeper.
""We could have easily just shut the doors. Instead we decided to push harder."" Part of that, he says, was deciding to use his takeaway window as a way to keep the local community connected.
""They would come down and have a five or a ten-minute conversation [at the window]. It was their one piece of social interaction for the day.""
It became clear through these conversations how dire the situation had become for many people, he says.
""We were hearing about people not having food on their tables. Every second person you spoke to was struggling with something. I could see the fear everywhere. From people telling me 'I'm missing my mum, I'm worried about my grandma,' to 'I've had enough'.""
After a three-hour conversation to talk a friend out of suicide, he decided to take a mental health first aid course online.
""He had a breakdown and he was on the edge of killing himself,"" Mr Lanigan says. ""He'd lost his events company, and there was no roadmap, no direction, no hope.""
""The conversations I was having sitting at that window on the street every day, it was evident that people needed help, and I needed to be more qualified and confident to give it.""
He says the real economic and mental health toll will become clearer in the months to come, especially when government wage subsidy schemes end.
""I think you'll see the real fallout in March, April and May next year. That will be when you get a real understanding of the unemployment figures, a real understanding of the mental health toll, a real understanding of the suicide figures,"" he says.
On Friday, Victoria's chief health officer Brett Sutton said the 28 days without a new infection was ""rightly worthy of celebration"", but acknowledged many had ""suffered enormously"". More than 800 people in the state had died, he added.
""So it's only right that many of us still feel anxious, angry or burdened by sadness,"" he tweeted.
Ms Glentis says that reopening feels like she's starting from scratch, with the shop sometimes empty on weekdays.
""The business was decimated. We've lost a lot of our regular customers and our corporate customers in the area. A lot of the residents moved. It means that we literally have to start from zero again.""
""It is a little bit soul-destroying, but I am the most positive person, and we will work as hard as we can to get back to where we were.""
Ms Glentis says she is anxious about another outbreak, however.
""What worries me the most is having to do this all over again. I don't think on a personal level, I will be able to get through this again.""

This is a response to the article posted by Dr. Ryan Maue here titled: CEI misses the boat on the need for the National Weather Service.  Ryan’s response is in the comments, and here is the key clause:
…The CEI should think about their statement about the “private collection” and ownership of weather data. How did that work for the UK Met-Office + Hadley Center with Phil Jones’ climate data? (climate data is weather data, btw)

By Iain Murray and David Bier
The most difficult task free-market advocates often face is in addressing the duties the government has already assumed.  Who will provide education?  Who will deliver the mail?  Who will coordinate airline flights? The knee-jerk reaction is generally that it is too difficult for the private sector to provide these services. Our recent op-ed [“Do We Really Need a National Weather Service?”], in which we argued that the private sector could provide the services provided by the National Weather Service (NWS), met precisely that reaction.

Each response seemed to conclude that we wanted the NWS’ services to disappear.  That is analogous to saying that advocates of privatizing the U.S. Postal Service want to end mail delivery. Or that proponents (like CEI) of Federal Aviation Administration privatization want to end air traffic control.  Such a suggestion would indeed be “laughable,” as some critics put it, but we never suggested that.
Therefore, most of the responses simply attacked a straw man. On reflection, we should have been more explicit that we were calling for the privatization of the government’s civilian weather services, not their outright abolition. Our piece was too easy to misinterpret.
Nearly all the responses dismissed the notion that the services of the NWS could be provided privately.  Yet Britain’s Meteorological Office is already a self-funding, commercial entity, and the British government is now considering selling it to a private corporation, much as the Canadian government sold its air traffic control (ATC) service to the now award-winning NavCanada.
Private weather services often rely on NWS data. But we repeat that no one (to our knowledge) wants to shut down NWS services. The existence of many private weather agencies demonstrates a significant demand for this information, and the fact that they do more with the data and provide even more accurate forecasts strongly suggests that private entities would improve on the data collection functions the NWS currently provides. There is no intrinsic reason why the infrastructure for this data collection function should be publicly owned. Our critics have advanced none, other than the fact that it is currently publicly owned.
Historically, privatization has led to more investment in a service or industry, not less. For example, the privatization of water utilities in Britain almost doubled investment in that vital service — and increased quality, as well. The UK Laboratory of the Government Chemist has seen a fivefold increase in its number of staff since privatization.
Some responses discussed NOAA, the agency that oversees the NWS, and other government agencies which were not referenced in our piece. To be clear, we do not envision private planes replacing all military reconnaissance flights, as some (including Dr. Maue) suggested, but military data collection is not incompatible with a NWS privatization plan.  The private sector owners could – and perhaps should – pay the military for the information.
Some have argued that the private sector could not afford to purchase the assets of the NWS. If that is the case(and we doubt it is), then the NWS can be sold as either one or a number of companies via IPO.
Either way, the sale of the NWS would bring in substantial revenue for the government at a time we are told it needs it most. At the very least, the NWS should begin to operate as a Performance-Based Organization, charging for its services. That will allow private companies to decide whether or not they are receiving value for money. If they are not, we will see more competition, and therefore increased accuracy, in data collection.
Even when the government stands in the way by means of regulation, that is advanced as justification for more government.  Accuweather’s Mike Smith argues that, “[C]urrent federal policy (set by the FCC) will not allow private sector companies to run 10cm weather radars. For technical reasons, 10cm are vital in measuring precipitation. We must have a federal entity for that.” Why? The reason for the ban is unclear, but if the NWS already gets an exception to FCC rules, a private competitor could be granted one as well.  If there are genuine national security or interference issues, then a rigorous licensing procedure respecting those concerns should suffice.
It may surprise some to learn that privatization is not new to the NWS. Over the years, the Service has divested such programs as direct commercial radio and television broadcasts, newspaper weather page preparation, agricultural forecasts, and the fire weather service. The latter two were privatized as recently as the mid-1990s. In each case, government officials simply decided that government had no real business providing the service. Our suggestion simply follows that logic.
The arguments against privatization focus on the role the government already plays, as if the service would disappear otherwise.  This flawed logic is trotted whenever government monopolies are criticized. The National Weather Service is not exceptional.  If people demand weather forecasts and advisories, and government gets out of the business, the market will provide.

"As delegates gather once again for climate talks in Bonn, the question has to be asked: after decades of conferences, committees, procedures and protocols, is the multilateral approach to tackling climate change working? What alternative routes are there that would lead to more action with less discussion? Are unilateral measures – where states take steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions without international agreements – so far-fetched? One measure that could have an effect if enacted by economic superpowers such as the US or the European Union is a carbon consumption tax. This is one of several progressive ideas to be presented at the congress Global Challenges: Achieving Sustainability taking place in October in Copenhagen. A carbon consumption tax, even if introduced by the EU and the US, would be a unilateral measure in the sense that it does not emerge from an organised collective international organisation such as the UNFCCC (the UN climate change body), but rather from the choices of individual states. Unilateral measures are usually considered to be “politically correct” if building on existing efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions. But the carbon consumption tax we propose would also reduce greenhouse gas emissions worldwide – action deemed less politically correct as it is deliberately aimed at affecting behaviour in other states. As a tax on products, it would be a trade measure and would consequently have to be designed to legally conform with World Trade Organisation rules in order to survive potential legal challenges. Some states might even reject such initiatives simply because they originate from the US or EU. Despite its own complications, unilateralism seems more appealing than multilateralism if the latter fails to deliver results on issues of great importance to future generations. While it may be seen as politically incorrect even to propose such an idea, it could be the only pragmatic and viable solution to today’s global challenges. A carbon consumption tax would effectively curb greenhouse gas emissions in all countries that want to export their goods to countries that impose it. For a long time such proposals have been seen as some type of “eco-imperialism”, or economic protectionism designed to keep developing countries from access to markets for their products. But the harsh reality of today’s climate challenges may be sufficient to change that view.  First, exporting is entirely voluntary – if countries can find other trading partners with less stringent requirements they are welcome to take their products elsewhere. Second, developing countries – such as China – are themselves beginning to take their own steps to curb pollution because their environmental problems are becoming too large. So a consumption tax may prompt investment in modernised production lines and manufacturing processes, with the subsequent effect of also improving working conditions, which in many developing countries is a cause for concern. But a consumption tax implemented by the EU and US would go further, effectively assigning responsibility for climate change. Under the  UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol, developing countries were not subject to any restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions. The language of the agreements refer to “common but differentiated responsibilities”, without further explanation. This leads to a situation where developed countries are faced with environmental measures that are too costly to implement if competing economies in the developing world are not required to do the same. A carbon consumption tax, however, would change the locus of regulation from production to end consumption or use. For example, about a third of China’s greenhouse gas emissions are accounted for by goods exported for use or consumption elsewhere. Shifting the burden from production to consumption would completely reconfigure the current impact on climate change action (or inaction), and if there is still any hope for a legally binding post-Kyoto Protocol with hard targets for at least some countries, this may be as good a time as any to do so. When analysing the responsibility for climate change, it’s important to note that it is inherently a global problem and part of mankind’s common concern. Emissions from a country such as Denmark affects all other countries just as much as those from China or Britain or the US, and so are of equal interest to all people from all nations. Why not adopt a legislative framework that puts the burden on the consumer, rather than require nations to enforce against the producer? Decades of enforcing the “polluter pays principle” on a global scale has led to inefficient rules that have produced little, if any, reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, as few countries are willing to shoulder the additional costs."
"The call came as she sat in her hotel room. “They gave us 10 minutes to pack up and leave,” Dr Safaa Kumari was told down a crackling phone line. Armed fighters had just seized her house in Aleppo and her family were on the run. Kumari was in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, preparing to present a conference. She immediately began organising a sprint back to Syria. Hidden in her sister’s house was a small but very valuable bundle that she was prepared to risk her life to recover.  Kumari is a plant virologist. Her work focuses on a quiet yet devastating development crisis. Climate-fuelled virus epidemics affecting fava beans, lentils and chickpeas are spreading from Syria to Ethiopia, gradually destroying the livelihoods of low-income populations. Known as “poor man’s meat”, these pulses are vital for both income generation and food security in many parts of the world. Finding a cure was urgent, Kumari explains. Hopeless farmers were seeing increasing levels of infected crops turning yellow and black. The cause? “Climate change provides aphids with the right temperatures to breed exponentially and spread the epidemics,” she says. For 10 years, Kumari worked to find a solution. Finally, she discovered a bean variety naturally resistant to one of the viruses: the fava bean necrotic yellow virus (FBNYV). “When I found those resistant seeds, I felt there was something important in them,” says Kumari from her lab in Lebanon where she now works. Only the fighting in Syria had moved. “I had left them at my sister’s in central Aleppo to protect them from the fighting,” she says. Determined not to let a war get in the way of her work “for the world’s poor”, Kumari felt it her duty to rescue the seeds in Aleppo. “I was thinking: how am I going to get those seeds out of Syria? “I had to go through Damascus, and then drive all the way to Aleppo. There was fighting and bombings everywhere.” After two days’ driving along dangerous roads, seeds in hand, Kumari made it to Lebanon, where she now works as a researcher at Icarda (International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas) in the Bekaa valley, close to the Syrian border. Hassan Machlab, Icarda’s country manager says: “Many of the Syrian scientists we welcomed here have suffered. It is tough.” But bringing the seeds to safety was only the beginning. Kumari needed to turn them into a sustainable solution. As crop production collapsed in the region, producers started to rely heavily on insecticides. “Most farmers go to the field and spray it without safety material – masks and appropriate jacket,” she says. “Some are dying, others are getting sick or developing pregnancy issues.” At first, the sample failed. “So we crossed them with another variety that had a better yield and obtained something that is both resistant and productive,” says Kumari. “When we release it, it will be environment-friendly and provide farmers with a good yield, more cheaply and without insecticide.” Kumari now plans to distribute her super-seeds free to farmers. She has already turned down an offer from a large company for the virus detection technology. “They wanted to buy our product and then sell it to the farmers, but we refused,” says Kumari. “Ours is free. It’s our responsibility to provide our solutions to people everywhere,” she says. But, as for many Syrian refugees, the war is never far from her thoughts, “Something she won’t tell you is that it wasn’t easy for her,” says Machlab. “She was working on all this and she didn’t have a clear mind as her family were in Aleppo and her house was destroyed.” Kumari adds: “Last week I saw my family in Turkey. I have five sisters and three brothers, scattered in Germany, Turkey, Syria. The last time we met was in Aleppo in 2012. When I came back someone told me ‘Safaa, you’re looking great today!’ Of course, I had just spent time with my family again!” she says, laughing. But she adds: “It’s not easy for me, it’s not easy for a woman to work on agriculture (research). It’s not easy, but it’s OK. “When I’m working, I’m not thinking I am a Syrian or a woman though. But I do feel I sometimes receive funding [from westerners] because I’m a woman,” she says. “Perhaps!” "

Clowns to the left of me, Jokers to the right, here I am _Stuff_ ed in the middle with you.



The only good thing about this latest piece of climate emergency idiocy is that the writer keeps talking about ‘global warming’.



The official figures say that the trend since December 1978 is 0.13C/decade. So in the four decades that the global warming scam has been running, the temperature has risen 0.52C.



This humungous rise in temperature is threatening our native birds.



Native birds are being forced to live in shrinking high-altitude habitats by the double whammy of a climate change “thermal squeeze” and marauding predators at lower levels.



The latest study by three Manaaki Whenua-Landcare Research scientists shows expanding populations of rats, stoats and possums in birds’ lower-level, warmer, environments, along with lowland forest loss, are effectively shrinking bird habitats to less ideal, higher-elevation and cold environments.



Using the findings of the New Zealand Ornithological Society’s bird atlases for the 1969-1979 and 1999-2004 periods, the researchers found the birds most endangered by the thermal squeeze are the larger bodied and often already rare species, such as kiwi, whio, weka and kakako. […]



Kiwi are found from Northland to Fiordland. Weka are found on Kawau Island in the north and Stewart Island in the south. Without access to detailed temperature records it would seem a safe bet that the typical temperatures in these places differ by more than 0.5C. 



There are two factors mentioned. One, predators, is a real threat; the second, global warming (aka thermal squeeze) is a nonsense designed to get headlines and funding. 



“ **The answer is going to be predator management** on a large scale.”



Forest & Bird spokesman Geoff Keey said the findings were bad news for forest birds, especially kiwi, kaka and whio.



“The situation is likely to worsen with climate change, which will reduce the extent of cooler refuges where predator numbers are lower for much of the time. […]



  
However, there is good news on the horizon. Even the great warmist, NASA, is agreeing that we are entering another period of cooling due to the solar cycles and sunspot activity. Temperatures a likely to be 1C cooler through the next cooling period until around 2050.



We can cross one concern off the list and just get on with predator control.

“A veritable dusting” as Time says of Friday’s snow in San Francisco (“the first snow in 35 years“), but that was at 900 feet (in the Twin Peaks neighborhood). Here’s a picture I just got from some friends on the western edge of the Santa Clara valley (“Silicon Valley”), fifty miles south of San Francisco:

Early Saturday morning, Saratoga CA, exact elevation 630 feet according to Google Earth. Light snow melts in the morning sun.
Overall, we’ve had a balmy winter in California, balmy enough that when my furnace went out, I was able to get by for a month just by leaving all the “heat balls” on:


Heat ball central. 195 watts of up.
I have 15 bulbs I can turn on in my two most occupied rooms for about 1500 watts of warming. Remember, according to the British government, 95% of ot the electricity that powers an incandescent bulb is “wasted” on heat production, making them very efficient heat producers.
Leaving all my lights on yields as much heat as this 1500 watt space-heater, with the added benefits of a lot more light, and a lot less danger:

I didn’t even use the space heater except when company was over. Now I’m using this:

Ahhh. That’s better. New 2-stage furnace, of the standard non-condensing variety.
If warmth is “wasted” energy then so is life, which explains why the greens don’t account the cost of stripping every household of the equivalent of one or two emergency space heaters. “This wasted energy adds to your carbon footprint,” says the Downing Street gang, and if the occasional furnace failure reduces the occasional serf’s carbon footprint to zero, the accounting is even better!
Lunatics. If incandescent bulbs create too much heat in summer, people can turn them off. There is plenty of natural light during the long day and the psyche does not crave more than enough to see by. Those free people who can stomach the sallow dinge of the swirly-cone CFLs can decide for themselves if they want to switch bulbs for the season, but in winter, lots of light and lots of heat are the perfect combination.
Snow in Palo Alto?
Just for the record, I’ve been predicting snow in the flatlands of Palo Alto for the last two years (hence the picture of snow from my friends in Saratoga). My prediction got derailed last year by El Nino (though Texas, Las Vegas, D.C. and the rest of the country still made me look good).
I don’t WANT snow. Unlike warming, cooling is actually dangerous. But with the sun going quiet, history says that cooling is what we are in for.
Make your next furnace a 2-stage
My new 2-stage furnace is great. The old furnace was rated a modest 70,000 btu, but was still on the large side for my small 1300 sq. ft. house, especially since there isn’t a lot of call for heat around here. So the old furnace would blast hot for a couple of minutes, prompting clothing adjustments while failing to circulate warmth evenly before clicking the thermostat off.
The new furnace uses the same two-wire thermostat but has a timed delay before turning the heat on full blast. It comes on at about half-heat (40,000) and half fan-speed. If five or ten minutes of that are not enough to click the thermostat back off (you can set the delay) then the furnace goes into high heat mode (70,000 btu, same as the old furnace) until the job is done.
So far the only time the furnace gets to high heat mode is when I turn the thermostat up in the morning. From there the furnace just keeps topping off the household heat with the low-heat mode, creating much more even heating than the old furnace. Highly recommended. And just in time.
“It’s frickin freezing in here Mr. Bigglesworth”
Had to scrape frost off the windshield this morning, and when I got in the shower, the words just came out. More a matter of California construction than the temperature outside (no heat in the bathroom). Maybe I’ll install a few more heat balls!

"The government’s top Great Barrier Reef scientist says a third mass bleaching event in five years is a clear signal the marine wonder is “calling for urgent help” on climate change. One quarter of the Great Barrier Reef suffered severe bleaching this summer in the most widespread outbreak ever witnessed, according to analysis of aerial surveys of more than 1,000 individual reefs released on Tuesday.  Dr David Wachenfeld, chief scientist at the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, told Guardian Australia: “My greatest fear is that people will lose hope for the reef. Without hope there’s no action. “People need to see these [bleaching] events not as depressing bits of news that adds to other depressing bits of news. They are clear signals the Great Barrier Reef is calling for urgent help and for us to do everything we can.” Prof Terry Hughes, director of the Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University, surveyed 1,036 reefs from a plane over nine days in late March. The marine park authority also had an observer on the flights. Hughes has released maps showing severe levels of bleaching occurred in 2020 in all three sections of the reef – northern, central and southern – the first time this has happened since mass bleaching was first seen in 1998. Some 25% of the reefs were severely bleached – meaning that more than 60% of the corals on each reef had bleached. Hughes said previous observations had shown that bleaching at that extent leads to “high levels of mortality” of corals. The Great Barrier Reef has experienced five mass bleaching events – 1998, 2002, 2016, 2017 and 2020 – all caused by rising ocean temperatures driven by global heating. Hughes said there probably would not be the same level of coral death in the north and central regions in 2020 as in previous years, but this was partly because previous bleaching outbreaks had killed off the less heat-tolerant species. The #GreatBarrierReef has experienced the third mass coral bleaching event in five years, explains @ProfTerryHughes@jcu @CoralCoE @MorganPratchett pic.twitter.com/nAQOQWcgq5 The 2020 bleaching was second only to 2016 for severity, Hughes said. Corals can recover from mild bleaching, but scientists say those corals are more susceptible to disease. Severe bleaching can kill corals. Hughes said severe mass bleaching had never before hit the southern section of the reef – from Mackay south. That area had high numbers of heat-sensitive corals that “light up like a Christmas tree” when viewed from the air. “It’s not too late to turn this around with rapid action on emissions,” he said. “But business-as-usual emissions will make the the Great Barrier Reef a pretty miserable place compared to today.”  In February the reef was subjected to its hottest sea surface temperatures since records began in 1900. Some scientists fear that rising levels of heat being taken up by the ocean have pushed tropical reefs to a tipping point at which many locations bleach almost annually. Wachenfeld said the reef’s sheer size – it comprises about 3,000 individual reefs – made it resilient, “but climate change brings a new scale of impact unlike anything we have seen before”. He told Guardian Australia: “Three mass bleaching events in five years is showing us the enormous scale at which climate change can operate. “No one climate event will kill the Great Barrier Reef, but each successive event creates more damage. Its resilience is not limitless and we need the strongest possible action on climate change.” The globe has already warmed by about 1C above pre-industrial levels, caused primarily by rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels. Wachenfeld said: “We’re at about 1C and we have just had three marine heatwaves in five years that have all damaged the reef.” Measures to improve the resilience of the reef include improving water quality, controlling outbreaks of coral-eating starfish, and research and development to improve the heat tolerance of corals. “None of that is a substitute for strong action on emissions,” Wachenfeld said. “Dealing with the climate problem is the underpinning for everything else to work.” Under the Paris climate agreement, countries agreed to deliver country-wide plans that would keep global heating well below 2C, with an aim to keep temperatures to 1.5C. “That’s the window we have to aim for,” Wachenfeld said. “As we approach and go beyond 2C, I don’t see the tools we have today, and the tools that research and development is working on, will protect the reef. “The world is heading for 3C of warming – we will not be able to protect coral reefs under those circumstances. “The reef is, after this event, a more damaged ecosystem, but it can still recover. It needs more help from us and it needs it urgently. This is a call to action.” In a statement to Guardian Australia, the environment minister, Sussan Ley, said: “It is deeply concerning the reef has suffered another bleaching event and our focus has to be on the ways that we can reduce the pressure on the reef and strengthen its resilience. “The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has been monitoring the situation closely and highlighting the concerns over temperatures. “Thankfully, some of the most recognised tourism areas have been less impacted but that does not change the importance of the issue and the importance of coordinated global action on emissions reduction to reduce ocean temperatures.” Queensland’s minister for environment and the Great Barrier Reef, Leeanne Enoch, said climate change, pollution from run-off and other threats “are testing the reef’s ability to recover from major disturbances like mass bleaching events, severe tropical cyclones and crown-of-thorns starfish.” She said the Palaszczuk government had “committed to a zero net emissions target by 2050” and allocated more than $427m for reef protection and resilience between 2015 and 2022. “The missing piece continues to be leadership and action from the federal government on climate change,” she said."

On Friday I wrote about how the print edition of Die Zeit had published a twisted drive-by slander piece on climate skeptics, targeting Marc Morano of Climate Depot, the Heartland Institute, EIKE and Fritz Vahrenholt (photo left).
Unsurprisingly the report’s authors, Kerstin Kohlenberg and Anita Blasberg, have no formal science training; they are sociology majors. That explains one reason why the piece had no focus at all on the science. The other reason is that science just doesn’t support their narrative. No warming in 15 years.
Die Zeit’s lengthy article exposes a perception of the climate debate that is foreign to reality. They seriously believe it is being masterminded by a few evil industrialists and a PR wizard, at least that’s what their readers should believe. Anyone familiar with even the most basic of research quickly sees that there’s a huge growing body of science that has long since cast serious doubt in the field.
The doubt stems from the science, not from bloggers are PR people.
The climate skepticism movement is driven by bloggers and non-mainstream media outlets who base all their reporting on the latest science coming out, and the major flaws found in the old science. All the skeptic blogs out there are not centrally orchestrated by sinister industrialists. We’re funded by millions? Give me a break.
I can’t speak for all blogs, but you can be sure that almost all of them are getting by on a shoestring, operated voluntarily. NoTricksZone, for example, is purely voluntary and receives no donations. A tiny bit of money is earned through ads. It’s a one-man show.
If the blogs received just a small fraction of the funding and media attention the NGOs and environmental organisations get, the debate would end lightning fast. Already just one single major media skeptic report is enough to throw throw the entire warmist movement into chaos for weeks.
Marc Morano doesn’t write the stuff that bloggers report. His Climate Depot is an aggregator of everything the bloggers and skeptic journalists write. Many of the skeptic blogs are run by scientists, engineers, statistics experts and so on who see serious flaws in the data.
Big Oil did not buy 15 years of no warming.
Dirty reporting
Thursday’s Die Zeit piece was not the first of its kind. It’s just a rehash of a warped story they had written 2 years ago. The only difference is that they have since found a couple of new villains: Morano and Vahrenholt. The ultimate target of the Die Zeit piece is to marginalize Vahrenholt here in Germany.
If anything, the Die Zeit piece confirms how the warmists have lost the scientific debate. They have nothing left but to scrape the bottom of the journalism gutter, forced to resort to name-calling, lying and slander. We’ve seen it before. In my view, the piece has Rahmstorf’s fingerprints all over it.
In addition to Morano, Die Zeit’s piece focuses on the European Institute of Climate and Energy (EIKE), who they say “is supported by CFACT, the employer of Marc Morano”. So what?
Die Zeit, having never attended an EIKE climate conference, finds nothing good to write about alternative scientific views and EIKE conferences. They write:
In addition to Singer, someone from the Heartland Institute will speak. A Canadian blogger is going to present her new, critical book on the IPCC. […] On the advisory Council of EIKE sits a journalist, and a forestry scientist. The president is a historian, and the vice president is an electrical engineer, who in his presentations likes to describe the horror scenarios of an eco-dictatorship: no heat, no cars, no factories.”
Die Zeit presents proof that readers should not trust EIKE: “Here you’ll find links to websites like Marc Morano’s, or to klimaskeptiker.info, the ‘forum against disinformation on the greenhouse gas effect and climate protection.'”

Die Zeit’s contempt for skeptics really comes through as you read through the piece. They say the skeptic movement in Germany would be a joke, were it not for Fritz Vahrenholt:
One would just laugh at the German denier scene and view it as harmless, had a political heavyweight not entered the stage recently.”
Here they’re referring to Professor Fritz Vahrenholt who together with Sebastian Lüning authored a bestselling skeptic book Die kalte Sonne, which sent shockwaves through Germany’s alarmist circles. Overnight Vahrenholt had been transformed to Germany’s no. 1 climate science villain. Die Zeit writes:
Vahrenholt does not claim that the climate scientists are fraudsters, but he does suggest that they are all dumber than he is. In truth, the Earth is warming much more slowly than previously believed. He, Vahrenholt, discovered that.”
Here we see just how dirty and misleading Die Zeit can get. Anyone who has read his book can tell you that Die Zeit’s above suggestion is pure rubbish. Nowhere will you find Vahrenholt claiming “he discovered the warming is slowing”.
Die Zeit also takes issue with the rest of the media for even giving the skeptics any coverage, suggesting other views should be ignored:
Every statement made by a climate scientist gets accompanied by a statements from a climate change denier – and so this is how we get way from the answer of what’s right and what’s wrong.”
Die Zeit doesn’t hold back with their use of the word “Leugner” (denier) to describe the skeptics. They hammer Vahrenholt’s credentials, describing how the professor of chemistry had been introduced when giving a speech in Dresden. Die Zeit writes:
On this evening, Vahrenholt is introduced as a scientist, as an expert on climate and environmental policy, as a manager, book author. Not a word is uttered that he represents a fringe opinion, that expert journalists took apart his book calling it a populist work written by an amateur.”
One of the harsh critics was climate scientist Mojib Latif, who later admitted he had never even read the book. And unfortunately, the last scientist who publicly debated Vahrenholt got his clock cleaned.
Overall, Die Zeit’s piece represents the radically hostile environment that scientific skepticism faces in Germany. It’s not the first time they wrongly try to ruin a person’s good reputation.
This level of hostility and intolerance has not been seen since Germany’s last dark period. Any prominent person thinking of outing his/her skepticism in Germany seriously has to think long and hard about it. Media outlets have openly stated that those who do so must be “prepared to pay a enormous price.”
Finally, Blastberg and Kohlenberg end their piece:
On the day that Fritz Vahrenholt spoke in Dresden, it had been exactly 14 years since Michael Mann published his hockey stick. During this time the annual output of CO2 on the planet has risen by more than 40%.”
And what has the temperature of the Earth done during the same period? Die Zeit chose not to mention it.

Guest post by the Viscount Monckton of Brenchley
Consider the Oldbury wind turbine, which WattsUpWithThat.com reveals was installed a couple of years ago at a primary school in the Midlands at a cost of £5000 sterling plus Vicious Additional Taxation at 17.5% (US $9694 in all).
In the first full year of the Oldbury White Elephant’s 20-year life it generated a gratifying 209 kilowatt-hours of electricity – enough to power a single 100-Watt reading-lamp for less than three months. The rest of the year you’ll have to find something else to do in bed.
Gross revenue for the year, at 11p (18 cents) a kilowatt-hour, was, um, almost £23 ($40). Assuming that there are no costs of finance, insurance or maintenance, and after subtracting 20 years’ revenue at last year’s rate, the net unamortized capital cost is £5,415.20 ($8,900).
Even this figure understates the true cost. The UK has hidden much of the cost of its climate measures behind a calculatedly complex web of levies, taxes, charges, and subsidies, and – above all – behind a furtive near-doubling of the true cost of electricity to pay vast subsidies (“yacht money”, as we landowners call it) to anyone connected with windmills. The website of the King Canute Department amusingly calls this obscurantist mish-mash “transparency”.
How much “global warming” will Jumbo the Albino forestall? While it is in operation, it will generate 209,000/365/24 or almost 24 Watt-hours per hour on average: just about enough to drive an electric toothbrush.

Mean UK electricity consumption, according to the Ministry of Transparency, is 43.2 GW. Electricity contributes one-third of UK carbon emissions, and the UK contributes 1.5% of world emissions. So the proportion p of global carbon dioxide emissions that the Worthless Windmill will forestall is 24 / 43,200,000,000 / 3 x 0.015, or 2.76 x 10–12, or, as Admiral Hill-Norton used to call it, “two-thirds of three-fifths of b*gger all”. Skip the next few paragraphs if mathematics makes your head hurt.
Today’s CO2 concentration is 390 parts per million by volume (less than 0.04%, though most people think it’s more like 20-30%). Instead of the 438 ppmv CO2 concentration that the IPCC predicts for 2030 on its A2 scenario, thanks to the Wonder Whirligig it will be 438 – p(438 – 390), or seven-eighths of a Hill-Norton below 438 ppmv.
IPeCaC, the UN’s climate panel says 8 Watts (no relation) per square meter of radiative forcing from CO2 and other bad things (p. 803 of its 2007 climate assessment) will cause 3.4 Celsius of “global warming” (p. 13, table SPM.3) from 2000-2100 (progress from 2000-2010: 0.0 Celsius).
That gives the “centennial-scale transient climate-sensitivity parameter”, which is 3.4/8 or 0.425 C/W/m2. Multiply this by 5.35, the coefficient in the CO2 forcing equation, to give the “centennial-scale transient global-warming coefficient” n = 2.274 C°. We don’t need to worry about warming beyond 2100 because, according to Solomon et al. (2009) it will take 1000-3000 years to come through, far too slow to cause unavoidable harm.
Multiply the logarithm of any proportionate change in CO2 concentration by the global-warming coefficient n and you get a central estimate of the warming that will occur (or be prevented) between now and 2100.
The Sandwell Sparrow-Slicer will only run for 20 years, not 100, so our value for n is going to be too big, overstating the warming the thing will actually forestall. But it’s Be-Nice-To-Bedwetters Week, so we’ll use the centennial-scale value for n anyway.
Let’s do it: 2.274 ln[438/(smidgen x tad <438)] is – well, put it this way, even my 12-digit-readout scientific calculator couldn’t do it, so I turned to Microsoft Excess. According to Bill Gates, the warming the Birmingham Bat-Batterer will forestall over the next 20 years will be rather less than 0.0000000000007 Celsius.
As the shopping channels say, “But wait! There’s more!!!” Well, there could hardly be less. How much would it cost, I wondered, to forestall 1 Celsius degree of warming, if all measures to make “global warming” go away were as hilariously cost-ineffective as this silly windmill?
You get the “mitigation cost-effectiveness” by dividing the total warming forestalled by the total lifetime cost of the project. And the answer? Well, it’s a very affordable £8 quadrillion ($13 quadrillion) per Celsius degree of warming forestalled. Remember, this is an underestimate, because our method tends to overstate the warming forestalled.
And that’s before we politicians ask any questions about whether IPeCaC’s estimates of climate sensitivity are wanton, flagrant exaggerations [cries of “No!” “Shame!” “Resign!” “I beg to move that the Noble Lord be no longer heard!” “What did I do with my expenses claim form?”].
Suppose it was just as cost-ineffective to make “global warming” from other causes go away as it is to make “global warming” from CO2 go away. In that event, assuming – as the World Bank does – that global annual GDP is £36.5 trillion ($60 trillion), what percentage of this century’s global output of all that we make and do and sell would be gobbled up in climate mitigation? The answer is an entirely reasonable 736%, or, to put it another way, 736 years’-worth of worldwide income.
This is an inhumanly large sum. So how much would each of the seven billion people on the planet have to cough up over the next century to forestall the 3.4 C global warming that IPeCaC hopes will happen by 2100? It will cost each of us more than £3.8 million ($6.3 milllion), and that’s probably a large underestimate. I’m going to have to sell the Lear ad go commercial. No – wait – what did I do with that glossy brochure about how many tens of millions I could make from the 30 250ft windmills I could put on the South Beat? Ah, here it is, under my expenses claim form.
“The Noble Lord,” the Canutists might say, “is deliberately taking a small, absurd and untypical example. Shame! Resign! Expenses!” etc. So here are the equivalent figures for the £60m ($100 million) annual 20-year subsidy to the world’s largest wind-farm, the Thanet Wind Array off the Kent Coast – that’s £1.2 billion ($2 billion) for just one wind-farm. KaChing! I think I’ll have another Lear. And a yacht, and a Lambo, and a bimbo.
The “global warming” that the Thanet wind-farm will forestall in its 20-year lifetime is 0.000002 Celsius, or two millionths of a degree, or 1/25,000 of the minimum global temperature change that modern methods can detect. The mitigation cost-effectiveness, per Celsius degree of warming forestalled, is £578 trillion ($954 trillion), or almost 6000 times the entire 296 years’-worth of UK peacetime and wartime national debt as it stood when Margaret Thatcher took office. That’s more than 1.7 million years’ British national debt, just to prevent 1 degree of warming.
Making IPeCaC’s predicted 3.4 C° of 21st-century warming go away, if all measures were as cost-ineffective as Thanet, would take more than half of the world’s gross domestic product this century, at a cost of more than £280,000 ($463,000) from every man, woman and child on the planet.
“The Noble Lord is still cherry-picking. Resign! Moat! Duck-island!” etc. So look at it this way. All of Scotland’s wind farms, which can in theory generate 10% of Britain’s electricity (actual output in that cold December when we needed them most: 0.0%), will forestall just 0.00002 degrees of warming in their 20-year lifetime – about the same as all of China’s windmills.
So there you have it. After the biggest and most expensive propaganda campaign in human history, leading to the biggest tax increase in human history, trying to stop “global warming” that isn’t happening anyway and won’t happen at anything like the predicted rate is the least cost-effective use of taxpayers’ money in human history, bar none – and that’s saying something.
The thing about gesture politics is that the politicians (that’s us) get to make the gestures and the proles (that’ll be you) get to get the bill. I think I’ll have another moat. Torquil, don’t you dare put that expenses claim form on the fire. Think of the carbon footprint!

There are two capitalisms. There is mundane market capitalism and there is political capitalism. Markets regulated by the rule of law and governed by a freely functioning price system are post and beam in the architecture of prosperity. You step into a grocery and there in the freezer are your coveted waffles waiting as if someone knew you were coming for them. But no one is looking after your need for breakfast treats. Each looks after her own needs by looking to the free play of prices and there emerges a rough‐​but‐​remarkable convergence of the waffles wanted and the waffles supplied. As the great Adam Smith noted, it seems like magic, but it’s not. It’s just amazing — in the way the evolution of the eye is amazing.





Each element of a political market invites political wrangling. 



Government helps make markets work, and work better. Effective mundane markets exist within the institutions of property, contract, and law — institutions well‐​ordered governments support. Prudent regulation helps contain the harmful spillovers of productive activity. But there is little danger the waffle market will go haywire in the absence of intense scrutiny by government authorities. The lightly regulated markets of mundane capitalism deserve our continued trust because their quiet efficiency so rarely betrays it.



Political markets — less enabled by government than made by it — operate according to fundamentally different, and less trustworthy, principles. Propped‐​up by subsidy, structured by central diktat and created ex nihilo by edict, political markets may arise from noble aspirations but in the end are instruments always of the privileged and powerful.



Take contemporary financial markets. (Please!) These are not so much regulated by government oversight as they are constituted by the convoluted web of regulation that dictates who may sell what to whom and on what terms. The shape of our financial markets has emerged from the gradual accretion and rare subtraction of political intervention. But it is now brutally clear that financial markets are not stable simply because they are framed by law and watched by bureaucrats. It is not so hard to see why.



In political markets, the battle for competitive advantage is in part a battle over the rules of the game. That, in turn, is a battle for the hearts of minds of regulators, who generally know less, and are far less motivated, than the industry insiders they regulate. It is no surprise when regulators come to confuse the interests of the powerful (for whom they might someday wish to work, after all) with the interests of the public. As we have recently witnessed, the heavily regulated nature of our financial markets did not keep them from going haywire and taking the entire economy down with them. Appointing a better breed of bureaucrat fixes nothing. Even now, in the morning of the Obama era, Washington remains convinced that the country is best served by “rescuing” its self‐​immolating Wall Street wards.



It is the failure of this capitalism that accounts for the suffering of millions and explains our bitter decline. Yet President Obama asks for more. The controversial cap and trade scheme for limiting CO2 emissions is perhaps the most striking example. A cap and trade system would introduce a new market fabricated by government to regulate the entire economy of mundane markets. Cap and trade is based on the political invention of scarcity. But the problem of determining the ideal supply of emission permits is much like the Federal Reserve’s problem of determining the ideal quantity of government money. In both cases, bureaucrats must appeal to dubious mathematical models and pronounce on questions that remain the subject of raging scientific controversy. When the Fed produced the wrong answers, it helped inflate the housing bubble, which led to the ruin of our economy. Do we trust the government climate bureaucrats to do better?



Each element of a political market invites political wrangling. Obama’s budget assumes the government will rake in over $600 billion from auctioning the initial round of emissions permits. But carbon‐​heavy businesses, already suffering from the recession, are lobbying hard to be given permits for free. Industries that fear they will be hurt by the increased cost of emissions will push for an oversupply of permits, to keep permit prices low. Companies that reckon a high emissions cost will give them an advantage over their competitors will favor a low cap that keeps permit prices high. But the higher the price, the more those harmed by them will clamor for exemptions and rebates, and many will get them. The reality of cap and trade will be a typical political market: an expensive ramshackle compromise of competing forces.



But this can look pretty good if you think your team can win the political game. Jeff Immelt, the CEO of GE, is certainly excited about the opportunities Obama’s innovations in political capitalism offer his well‐​positioned corporate behemoth, which wields considerable influence in Washington. “The interaction between government and business will change forever,” Immelt recently wrote in a letter to shareholders. “In a reset economy, the government will be a regulator; and also an industry policy champion, a financier, and a key partner.” And GE, Immelt is sure, will profit nicely.



That’s political capitalism, that’s corporatism, in a nutshell. And that’s the kind of disreputable market system that got us into this mess.

The ‘transformational’ government of the coalition has taken some heavy, self-inflicted hits including the inability to institute a capital gains tax, dropping the Kermadec Island sanctuary, walking back Kiwibuild housing numbers, ousting Curran and Whaitiri and loss of business confidence to name a few. 



The most consequential back-down, however, has gone almost unnoticed. Maybe the MSM just didn’t want to give it any focus as they were obviously big supporters. It involves **a commitment to 100% renewable electricity in New Zealand by 2035,** agreed shortly after the 2017 general election between the Labour and Green parties. The policy is in their agreement on confidence and supply.



Late in 2017, Cabinet agreed to set up an interim committee to plan the policy of delivering 100% renewables also **establishing a permanent Climate Change Commission** , another item in the Coalition agreement.



Shock, horror, the committee came back with a recommendation to drop the 100% renewables policy by 2035. The Coalition had little option but to agree. In one fell swoop, a huge hole had been blown in the Coalition’s plans. James Shaw had a mouthful of dead rats, yet again. The Greens took a sucker punch. One of their dearest goals just went ‘poof’ in a haze of CO2.



The “for the public” explanation was that the policy would have increased power prices but done little to reduce emissions.



The reality is that it was a green, wet dream. It would have seriously hurt those on low incomes by sending power prices through the roof and wrecked the viability and competitiveness of our export industries who rely heavily on our relatively low-cost hydroelectric power generation to market their goods offshore. It would have created endless blackouts causing havoc for homes, businesses, urban motorists etc and filled the skyline with more obscene wind machines that kill birds and produce damaging low-frequency sounds. Ironically it would have also had us opening new coal mines to fill the gaps when it is dark, cold and the wind stops.



The country has dodged a bullet. Beware though as there are others in the gun’s chamber like the Emissions Bill going through the house now. 



The hit on the coalition demands more scrutiny. Of course, we are unable to have a discussion in the MSM – a draconian and sinister misuse of editorial power – so few in the public will see it for what it is – **a significant back-down** and damage to the extreme green policies of the red, left-leaning Greens and Labour.



The scrutiny would show that much of the environmental policy of the coalition is wishful thinking. It’s ideology. It’s trumped-up, airy-fairy nonsense that has no basis in sound reputable science or logic. Nor does it have a place in policymaking.



It’s based on manipulated graphs that turned cooling temperatures into warming temperatures using hidden or distorted data. It’s based on models produced by geeks that cannot agree between themselves and that in 20 years or so have plotted temperatures so far above actual it’s laughable. 



It’s based on a ‘hockey stick’ graph that emerged from one scientist studying the growth rings in half a dozen spruce trees in Siberia and ignoring decades of research into ice cores from multiple international sites that show a medieval warm period hotter than it is now. (Note: It is Greenland, not Whiteland) 



It’s based on fictitious claims of hot days, record temperatures, hottest months, warmest years when in many countries temperatures in the 1930s were several degrees hotter. It’s based on a politician’s movie that contained 35 proven factual errors but won him a handsome bank balance and a share of a Nobel Peace Prize. 



It’s based on striking terror into people’s lives, especially the young and vulnerable with wild stories of sea-level rise swamping islands and cities, horror tales of increasing storms, tornadoes, hurricanes, droughts, floods, rain events when all the factual data shows the weather improving over 100 years of records.



It’s also based on the work of pseudo-scientists, who do no original, on the ground research but feed off the most recent outlandish claim and try and better it. It is Ponzi-science. 



When you have few facts to back your claims you show an emaciated, scraggy polar bear perched on a melting blob of ice and claim that proves the end of those sweet, cuddly species – a symbol of a doomed civilisation. No matter that their numbers are increasing to a point where a controlled reduction is discussed because the bears are over-running some areas.



 **You cannot build a house on the sand and expect it to last.** You cannot build policy on corrupt ideology and falsified science and expect it to perform.



Fortunately the appointed committee told it the way it was – they really didn’t have an option. The goal of all renewables by 2035 according to the PM is now ‘aspirational’. Hopefully, it will become ‘expirational’.

Climategate, Copenhagen, Snowmageddon in the nation’s capital, the EPA ruling that CO2 endangers us all, and Senate Republicans pushing for a global‐​warming tax. Has it been a great run‐​up to Earth Day, or what?



Never has a public‐​policy agenda been pursued with so little regard for scientific fact or for public opinion. In March, 48 percent of Americans agreed that global warming, while real, is exaggerated. When Gallup first asked this question in 1997, only 31 percent thought the threat exaggerated.



Despite this shift in sentiment, Sens. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) and John Kerry (D., Mass.) and President Obama insist upon ramming a new global‐​warming tax (called a “fee”) through the Senate. The bill is slated to be introduced next week, and vulnerable Democrats — weary already from the pugilistic health‐​care debate — are fleeing the legislation in droves.



And for the measure’s primary backers, the backdrop of recent developments on the climate‐​science landscape could not possibly be less fortuitous.



Climategate revealed that a small but influential coterie of climate scientists did everything they could to present messy global‐​warming data as a “nice tidy story,” meticulously crafted to “hide the decline” in tree‐​ring‐​based temperatures. (I use quotes because those are the words of the warming‐​alarmist scientists themselves.)



The fact is that tree rings are pretty poor indicators of annual warmth, especially in recent years. Dendrochronologists call this the “divergence” problem (cynics call it other names). Phil Jones, the central figure in Climategate, actually eliminated the “divergence” rather than “hiding the decline.” 



The amount of “explained variance” or statistical correlation between rings and temperatures during the summer growing season tends to run about 40 percent. That means more than half of the temperature changes for a fraction of the year (and even more for the entire year) are unexplained.



The famous “Hockey Stick” temperature history, by Penn State’s Michael Mann, is composed largely of marginally explanatory tree‐​ring data, which he subjected to a statistical analysis that produces different results depending on what portion of the data is chosen to represent the average condition. If there are 1,000 years of data, and one uses only the last 100 years to calculate the average against which to measure all the other years, that will help to produce an upward‐​pointing “hockey stick.” Using all of the data to form an average will give a smoother result.



Last week, David Hand, president of the Royal Statistical Society, acknowledged that “the particular technique they used exaggerated the size of the blade at the end of the hockey stick. Had they used an appropriate technique, the size of the blade of the hockey stick would have been smaller.… The change in temperature is not as great over the 20th century compared to the past as suggested by the Mann paper.”  




That revelation was accessible to the public, but not through the American legacy media. Sophisticated Internet sites such as cli​mateau​dit​.org, wattsup​with​that​.com, and rankex​ploits​.com are creating a parallel universe to that of the refereed science literature, largely in response to the obviously manipulated peer‐​review process evinced in the Climategate e‐​mails.



The data on these sites are every bit as technical as those in the standard literature. The sites’ contents would be published in such literature if some of the Climategate scientists weren’t so pathologically thin‐​skinned, and didn’t attempt to quash everyone and everything that deviates from their catechism.



As Climategate unfolded, so began the fiasco in Copenhagen, where global warming froze. The environmental world expected the December summit to produce a global commitment to specific reductions in carbon‐​dioxide emissions. President Obama famously barged in on a meeting of Brazil, South Africa, India, and China — and fled prematurely with nothing, hopping on Air Force one to reach Washington before the first of the season’s three blizzards did.



Yet perhaps the most damaging blows to the integrity of the warming‐​alarmist movement came directly from its most officious institutions: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the U.N. International Panel on Climate Change.



To strengthen Obama’s hand at Copenhagen, the EPA announced on the day the conference started that carbon dioxide was an “endangerment” to human health and welfare. The core assertion:





This statement is lifted from a blatantly political entity, the U.S. Climate Change Science Program, which in turn borrowed it from a 2007 manifesto authored by the IPCC. “Most” means more than half, and the EPA says the earth has warmed by about 0.70 degrees Celsius since 1950. As I’ve explained previously, a peer‐​reviewed paper that the EPA ignored in making their endangerment findings, as well as another published just a month later (which their scientists should have known about), have indicated that only about .31 degrees Celsius’s worth of warming can be attributed to greenhouse gases. That’s less than half.



Then, as the IPCC’s high‐​powered spin engine unspooled, it became clear that the entire 2007 report the EPA indirectly relied upon was a mess. Its absurd claim that the Himalayan glaciers could disappear in 25 years (they are hundreds of feet thick, and melting would take hundreds of years), it admitted, was in error. The author responsible for the chapter on Asian climate, Murari Lal, finally ‘fessed up that it was there to goad India, which derives water from these ice fields, into agreeing to emissions reductions.  




The primary author of the report is one of the world’s leading climatologists, Martin Parry. How could he have missed the Himalayan error? And, for that matter, how did he miss that IPCC used a non‐​refereed environmentalist publication to claim that yields from rain‐​fed agriculture in Africa could decline 50 percent in the next decade? His own research in the field shows otherwise.



The IPCC also claimed that over half of the Netherlands is below sea level. It’s actually 26 percent, but that one may be excusable: The non‐​refereed citation in that instance is the Dutch government.



Not excusable is using the World Wildlife Fund as the source for a statement that “up to 40 percent of the Amazon rainforest could react drastically to even a slight reduction in precipitation.” The Amazon just went through one of its biggest droughts in history, with little effect evident from satellite data.



Finally, the IPCC has denied up and down that there has been any significant change in Southern Hemisphere sea‐​ice cover. In fact, satellite data readily show a highly significant increase since measurements began in 1979.



That’s five exaggerations in one report. No one has yet found any instance in which the IPCC understated some effect of global warming. It’s like flipping a coin five times and getting all heads. It happens — with a probability of .03. Scientists like to use the .05 probability as the threshold for a significant relationship. In the case of the IPCC, the relationship is called “bias.”



Yes, it has been quite a year. Climategate. The failure in Copenhagen. The EPA issuing an endangerment finding in which the core scientific fact turns out to have been cooked. The IPCC blow‐​up. And yet Lindsey Graham and President Obama are dead‐​set on cramming a new global‐​warming tax down our throats. How they figure to sell this policy in light of what has happened since November is anyone’s guess. Damn the data; full speed ahead!

"Airlines in Europe have applied for €12.8bn (£11.3bn) government support since the start of the coronavirus pandemic with no binding environmental conditions attached, according to an analysis of the sector’s bailout pleas. By Tuesday this week, airlines including easyJet, Scandinavian Airlines and Tui had secured loans and other financial support amounting to €3.36bn. A further €9.47bn is being sought by other airlines, data tracking by Transport & Environment, Greenpeace and Carbon Watch reveals. By the time air travel came to a near halt in March, greenhouse gas emissions from the sector had reached record levels. But there are no binding environmental conditions being attached to any of the already agreed bailouts or future loans being sought. The exception is in Austria, where the transport minister, Leonore Gewessler, responded to a request for public support by Austrian Airlines (part of the Lufthansa group) by saying any bailout should be linked to climate targets. The amounts being negotiated for bailout plans and recapitalisation are likely to increase as talks continue with some of the biggest European airlines, including Air France, KLM, Lufthansa, British Airways and Alitalia. The Committee on Climate Change says cutting greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 is necessary, affordable and desirable. Here are some of the actions needed to make that happen: • Petrol and diesel cars banned from sale ideally by 2030 and 2035 at the latest. • Quadrupling clean electricity production from wind, solar and perhaps nuclear, plus batteries to store it and connections to Europe to share the load. • Connection of new homes to the gas grid ending in 2025, with boilers using clean hydrogen or replaced by electric powered heat pumps. Plus, all homes and appliances being highly efficient.   • Beef, lamb and dairy consumption falling by 20%, though this is far lower than other studies recommend and a bigger shift to plant-based diets would make meeting the zero target easier. • A fifth of all farmland – 15% of the UK – being converted to tree planting and growing biofuel crops and restoration of peat bogs. This is vital to take CO2 out of the air to balance unavoidable emissions from cattle and planes. • 1.5bn new trees will be needed, meaning more than 150 football pitches a day of new forests from now to 2050. • Flying would not be banned, but the number of flights will depend on how much airlines can cut emissions with electric planes or biofuels.  In the UK, Virgin’s Richard Branson has come under fire for seeking a £565m bailout from the government. He has been told to explore other ways of getting cash before seeking state aid but environmental conditions have not been at the forefront of government comments on the bailout plea. EasyJet, which has secured a £600m emergency loan from the UK government, emitted 4.1% more CO2 in 2019 than in 2018. Andrew Murphy, the aviation manager for Transport & Environment, said: “Airlines are seeking public money so they can get back to the business-as-usual of soaring emissions enabled by light-touch pollution laws and tax exemptions. “It’s time to ensure that aviation makes a green transition by linking aid to taxes and greener fuels which will reverse the sector’s rapid emissions growth.” Aviation is one of the fastest growing contributors to greenhouse gas emissions over the past 20 years. In the last five years there has been a 26% rise in GHG emissions from aviation. Last year, Ryanair joined coal plants as one of Europe’s top 10 polluters after increasing its emissions on flights within the continent by 5.9%. A global scheme run by the UN to offset aviation emissions that grow above 2020 levels, known as Corsia, began this year, but airlines are  seeking delays and changes to it as a result of the coronavirus crisis. The analysis published on Wednesday reveals that five of the airlines seeking or receiving state aid as a result of the Covid 19 pandemic have earned more than €1bn in net profits in the past five years. These include IAG, which owns British Airways (€9.37bn profit), Lufthansa group (€8.17bn), Tui group (€3.09bn), easyJet (€2.39bn) and Air France-KLM (€1.05bn). Airlines do not pay fuel taxes or VAT on flights. Faiza Oulahsen, from Greenpeace EU, said: “Public bailouts must come with strict conditions to protect jobs and slash the aviation sector’s soaring contribution to climate breakdown. “Any public funding should lay the foundation for a just and green transition for people and planet, with widespread investment in transport alternatives like trains. Governments must address both the economic impacts of the Covid-19 crisis and the crisis we face in climate change.”"

 _Global Science Report_ _is a weekly feature from the_ _Center for the Study of Science_ _, where we highlight one or two important new items in the scientific literature or the popular media. For broader and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly “Current Wisdom.”_   
  
On Monday of this week, three prominent and influential scientists published an opinion piece in _Politico_ arguing that anthropogenic global warming was responsible for making the destruction from “super storm” Sandy significantly worse than it otherwise would have been. They added that if we don’t “cut industrial carbon pollution,” we are going to get more of the same, and then some.   
  
On the same day, I argued here at Cato@Liberty that it could be reasoned that anthropogenic global warming _lessened_ the impact of Sandy.   
  
The scientific truth about the situation is that it is impossible to know who is right---the uncertainties are just too large. But I think it is fair to say that no matter what direction the influence of anthropogenic global warming was on Sandy, in net it was quite small.   
  
One difference between my piece and the _Politico_ article co-signed by Dr. Robert Corell (“senior policy fellow for the American Meteorological Society and former Chair of the United States Global Change Research Program”), Dr. Jeff Masters (""the founder and Director of Meteorology for Weather Underground and a former NOAA Hurricane Hunter"") and Dr. Kevin Trenberth (“Distinguished Senior Scientist in the Climate Analysis Section at the National Center for Atmospheric Research"") was that I tried to stick to a scientifically defensible argument. In their piece, they juiced up their case with some---how should I say this?---rather dubious facts.   
  
The worst of these was claiming that “[o]n the stretch of the Atlantic Coast that spans from Norfolk to Boston, sea levels have been rising four times faster than the global average.” They implied that anthropogenic global warming was the reason why.   
  
This is simply untrue.   
  
While it is true that the long-term (~20th century) rate of sea level rise along that stretch has been about twice the global average over the same period, it is scientifically well-established that the regional enhanced rate of sea level rise is due to ongoing geologic processes resulting from end of the last ice age. When these non-anthropogenic processes are properly subtracted out of the tide gauge record of sea level observations, the rate of sea level rise that is left over is virtually the same as the global rate of rise, not four times faster.   




The same conclusion is reached if you limit your comparison to the period of satellite observations of sea level, which began about 20 years ago. The figure below shows a map of the satellite-measured trends in sea level from 1993 through mid-2012. The global average rate of rise is 0.12 inches per year, which is represented by a sort of greenish yellow color. Turning your attention to the Northeast coast of the United States (you might have to squint a bit), you see that the color there is also sort of greenish yellow—in other words, right about the global average. Places where the sea level is rising four times faster than the global average are colored a light pink; while there are a few such places, none of them are anywhere near the stretch of coast between Norfolk and Boston.   






Figure 1. Spatial distribution of the rate of sea level rise across the globe as measured by satellite altimeters (Source: University of Colorado Sea Level Group, modified to reflect English units).   
  
It is somewhat telling when prominent climate scientists have to resort to incorporating incorrect (and readily debunked) science to try to bolster their case for climate alarm---an alarm that was raised to try to scare us into accepting regulations on greenhouse gas emissions.

Heathrow airport. Image via Wikipedia

OK, bad pun, but I could not resist.
From the National Center for Atmospheric Research/University Corporation for Atmospheric Research  something related to what we have always said, airports are not a representative environment for climate measurement.
Takeoffs and landings cause more precipitation near airports
BOULDER–Researchers have found that areas near commercial airports sometimes experience a small but measurable increase in rain and snow when aircraft take off and land under certain atmospheric conditions.
The new study led by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), is part of ongoing research that focuses on so-called hole punch and canal clouds that form when planes fly through certain mid-level clouds, forcing nearby air to rapidly expand and cool. This causes water droplets to freeze to ice and then turn to snow as they fall toward the ground, leaving behind odd-shaped gaps in the clouds.

The research team used satellite images and weather forecasting computer models to examine how often this type of inadvertent cloud seeding may occur within 62 miles (100 kilometers) of six commercial airports: London Heathrow, Frankfurt, Charles De Gaulle (Paris), Seattle-Tacoma, O’Hare (Chicago), and Yellowknife (Northwest Territories, Canada), as well as Byrd Station in Antarctica. They found that, depending on the airport and type of plane, the right atmospheric conditions typically exist up to 6 percent of the time, with somewhat more frequency in colder climates.
The lead author, NCAR scientist Andrew Heymsfield, says this phenomenon likely occurs at numerous other airports, especially in mid- and high-latitude areas during colder months. The key variable is whether there are cloud layers in the vicinity that contain water droplets at temperatures far below freezing, which is a common occurrence.
He adds that more research is needed before scientists can determine whether the precipitation produced by this effect is significant. The inadvertent cloud seeding may increase the need to de-ice planes more often, he adds.
“It appears to be a rather widespread effect for aircraft to inadvertently cause some measureable amount of rain or snow as they fly through certain clouds,” Heymsfield says. “This is not necessarily enough precipitation to affect global climate, but it is noticeable around major airports in the midlatitudes.”
The researchers did not estimate the total amount of rain or snow that would result from such inadvertent cloud seeding. However, they analyzed radar readings that, in one case, indicated a snowfall rate of close to an inch an hour after several planes had passed through.
The study is being published this week in the journal Science. Researchers from NASA Langley Research Center and the University of Wyoming, Laramie, co-authored the paper. Funding came from the National Science Foundation, which is NCAR’s sponsor, and from NASA.
Solving a cloud mystery
Scientists for decades have speculated about the origins of mysterious holes and canals in clouds. Heymsfield led a study last year establishing that the gaps, which sometimes look as though a giant hole punch was applied to a cloud, are caused when aircraft fly through midlevel clouds that contain supercooled droplets.
When a turboprop plane flies through such a cloud layer with temperatures about 5 degrees Fahrenheit or lower (about -15 degrees Celsius or lower), the tips of its propellers can cause the air to rapidly expand. As the air expands, it cools and causes the supercooled droplets to freeze into ice particles that evaporate the droplets and grow, falling out of the clouds as snow or rain.
Jet aircraft need colder temperatures (below about -4 to -13 degrees F, or -20 to -25 degrees C) to generate the seeding effect. Air forced to expand over the wings as the aircraft moves forward cools and freezes the cloud droplets.
The effect is unrelated to the trails of condensed water vapor known as contrails made by the exhaust of jet engines.
In the new research, the study team used cloud measurements taken by the NASA CALIPSO satellite to quantify how often such conditions exist within about 62 miles of several airports located in relatively cloudy areas. They chose the 62-mile radius because that is approximately the distance it takes for a commercial aircraft to climb above about 10,000 feet, where many of the supercooled cloud layers are located.
Of the major, mid-latitude airports studied, they found that the Frankfurt, DeGaulle, and O’Hare airports most frequently experienced the right conditions for propeller aircraft to generate precipitation. In each case, the conditions existed more than 5 percent of the time over the course of a year. The researchers found that the right conditions existed more than 3 percent of the time for jets at Heathrow, Frankfurt, and Seattle-Tacoma.
Yellowknife experienced such conditions more often, about 10 percent of the time for propeller planes and 5 percent for jets, presumably because of colder cloud conditions at higher latitudes. Byrd often experienced the very cold conditions that enable jets to cause inadvertent cloud seeding.
The researchers also found that a diverse range of aircraft can induce precipitation. By comparing observations of hole-punch and canal clouds made by a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellite with flight path records from the Federal Aviation Administration, they confirmed that commercial jets (such as Boeing 757s and the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 series of jets), military aircraft (B-52s), various regional and private jets, turboprops, and prop/piston planes all can induce precipitation.
Hole-Punch Cloud
Aircraft-induced hole observed at the West Antarctic Ice Sheet Divide Camp, Antarctica (79 28.058 °S 112 05.189 °W, 1806 m elevation) on Dec. 12, 2009, 1400 New Zealand Time. The cloud's bright cumuliform structure with gray fallstreaks below are visible. The hole first appeared on the horizon and then moved toward the camera. It is likely that a LC130 aircraft produced the ice that formed the hole. Photo provided by Eric Zrubek and Michael Carmody. For more information, please see Figure 1A in the manuscript.

“It appears that virtually any airplane that flies through clouds containing liquid water at temperatures much below freezing can cause this effect,” Heymsfield says.
Satellite readings analyzed by the team showed that holes and canals generated by aircraft can occur with some frequency. For example, an extensive cloud layer over Texas on January 29, 2007, contained 92 such gaps, some of which persisted for more than four hours and reached lengths of 60 miles or more.
Heymsfield and his colleagues also used a powerful software tool, known as the Weather and Research Forecasting model, to learn more about how the holes form and develop. They found that the hole rapidly spreads about 30 to 90 minutes after an aircraft passes through. This would be the peak time for precipitation associated with the cloud-seeding effect. After about 90 minutes, ice and snow begin to dissipate.

A nasty spat has erupted between Washington and Beijing over the Obama administration’s arms sales to Taiwan. As soon as the US made the official announcement of the US$6.4 billion package last Friday, Beijing responded with both harsh words and retaliatory measures. Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei called in US Ambassador Jon Huntsman for a dressing down. Beijing also suspended scheduled military exchange programs and threatened to impose sanctions against any American company involved in the production or distribution of weapons destined for Taiwan.



The conventional wisdom in the United States is that this episode is no big deal. Those who take a relaxed view contend that China’s reaction is in line with its response to previous arms sales. The new brouhaha, the reasoning goes, will subside and relations will soon return to normal.



Perhaps. But the arms sale showdown is just the latest in a series of incidents stoking tensions between China and the US. Those tensions encompass economic, diplomatic and security disputes.



Even before the Obama administration took office, US officials complained about a variety of practices that they believed gave China an unfair advantage in the global economic arena. Those ranged from an undervalued currency to import dumping and arbitrary exclusion of American products from China’s domestic market. President Barack Obama’s decision to impose punitive tariffs on imported Chinese tires last summer was a signal that US patience was wearing thin.



The annoyance is not confined to trade matters. Washington has long prodded Beijing to take a firmer stance against the North Korean and Iranian nuclear programs, and especially show a willingness to back more robust economic sanctions against those two countries.



Administration leaders hoped that the summit meetings with President Hu Jintao during Obama’s visit to China would lead to progress on Washington’s grievances. That did not happen. Not only did Chinese leaders largely rebuff the president’s requests for policy changes, there was a widespread perception in the US that the Chinese treated Obama with a dismissive attitude that bordered on disdain.



That treatment created a propaganda bonanza for Obama’s domestic political opponents. Critics excoriated him for “kowtowing” to the Chinese and argued that the China summit confirmed that Obama is a diplomatic lightweight who is incapable of defending important American interests. Most telling, his staunch defenders were few and far between regarding his performance in Beijing.



China’s unwillingness to back serious carbon‐​emissions reduction measures at the Copenhagen climate change summit did not help relations with Washington. Once again the Chinese seemed to defy the Obama administration on a high‐​priority US goal.



But Beijing has its own grievances with the US. Chinese officials have expressed both veiled and explicit complaints about the huge and growing US federal budget deficits. In their view, Washington’s profligate fiscal practices threaten to trigger an inflationary spiral that would undermine the value of China’s vast dollar holdings.



Chinese leaders also grow weary of Washington’s lectures about the need to get tough with North Korea and Iran. In Beijing’s view, America’s stubborn unwillingness to address the wider security concerns of those countries is at least as responsible as the recalcitrant attitude of the two regimes for the lack of progress on the nuclear issue. Moreover, officials believe that China is being asked to take measures that would undermine vital Chinese interests. They regard North Korea as an important security buffer and Iran as a crucial energy supplier, so are extremely reluctant to antagonize either regime. The announcement of the Taiwan arms sale, coming on the heels of US Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton’s harsh comment earlier the same day that China risked “isolation” within the international community if it did not endorse more robust sanctions against Iran, may have been the last straw for Beijing.



Contrary to the conventional wisdom, the Foreign Ministry’s response to the arms sale contained one element that departed from previous reactions. China had never before sought to sanction US firms for such transactions. That threat was a significant escalation and seemed contrary to Beijing’s obligations as a member of the World Trade Organization. One can hope that the conventional wisdom is right and that the latest dispute will soon fade.



But the bulk of the evidence suggests that storm clouds are building in the US‐​China relationship.



The world’s largest economy and its soon‐​to‐​be‐​main rival are not likely to become overt adversaries anytime soon, but there is a noticeable chill in the air.

"The Chelsea Flower Show is in full bloom. The UK’s annual botanical extravaganza celebrates all aspects of horticulture and is an important venue for watching emerging trends in the gardening world. But how can we maximise the green spaces we have to hand and also benefit the environment? In the UK, domestic gardens represent 20-25% of a city’s area and the vast majority of urban residents have access to one. What we grow in these green spaces and –- importantly – how they are managed, could have a significant environmental impact within our cities. There are a number of ways that plants and gardens provide positive and negative “services”. For example, scientists are confident that plants provide localised cooling, decrease the risk of flooding and support biodiversity. They are also confident about the risks and the extent of potential damage from using peat, chemicals and fertilisers in plant management. It is therefore critical that we use this knowledge to maximise the positive impact of our green spaces. Much as different management practices have a smaller or greater environmental impact, plants themselves can differ a huge amount in the different benefits (and costs) that they entail and provide.  In a recent study focusing on the cooling service provided by green roofs, our Royal Horticultural Society science team found that broad-leaved plants cooled their own and surrounding surfaces better than the traditionally used succulent plants. This is because the broad and thin-leaved plants use and lose more water than thicker-leaved succulents, cooling better through the process of transpiration. In our outdoor experiments, on a hot sunny summer day this led to broad-leaved Stachys byzantina (Lamb’s Ear) cooling the soil (and so potentially a roof surface if planted there) by a huge 12°C more than a covering of succulent Sedum.  Plants can capture and temporarily hold pollution particles from the air (such as from fuel burning and vehicular emissions); they can also take up gaseous pollutants like nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide. Research suggests that plants with complex leaf structures (including rough, hairy leaves) are likely to be capturing more pollutants across the range of particle sizes.  Conifers such as Leylands and pines have been shown to accumulate more particles (in the size ranges greater than 2.5μm) on their surfaces than broad-leaved tree species such as poplars, maples or whitebeams. But both broad-leaved and conifer species have been shown to accumulate well the finest particles (less than 1μm), potentially most detrimental to human health. So, growing longer-life, perennial plants such as trees and shrubs in our gardens will help decrease our carbon impact, enabling longer-term carbon storage in the plants and the soil. There are some simple and effective steps you can take in your own garden to maximise the positive environmental contribution of your green spaces, decrease the risk of surface flooding, insulate your house using vegetation and support biodiversity. Plant climbers and wall shrubs Most of us have walls and fences that have space for a climber or wall shrub. Using these leafy coverings helps insulate homes in winter (reducing heating bills) and keeps them cooler in summer. You can even go up the wall with plants by installing green-wall planting systems.  Grow plants for wildlife When it comes to encouraging wildlife, it’s a case of the more plants the better. Aim to grow as many different types of plant as you can, including natives, and provide as much cover as possible. This should help ensure that you provide food and shelter at most times of year. Use permeable paving Think carefully before you pave over your front garden. Where paving is necessary, keep the area as small as possible and use permeable materials (planning permission is required for non-permeable materials). These measures allow the rainwater to soak into the soil, rather than causing flooding. Install green roofs Any birds-eye view of a town or city reveals that roofs cover a substantial area. It is possible to turn these barren spaces into planted surfaces by installing a green roof. These range from plant mats rolled out over a prepared base to flowery coverings grown in deeper soil – just make sure your roof can take the weight. Worth considering on your new shed or an extension, green roofs help reduce flooding and cool the surrounding surfaces and air."
"The Soma coal mine tragedy in Turkey has again brought the issue of coal mining safety to the fore. With by far the largest coal industry in the world, accounting for half of global production, the Chinese experience has some lessons to offer Turkey in the wake of the Soma disaster.  For many years the toll of miners’ lives in China attracted significant amounts of media attention. But the situation, while still serious, has shown great improvement in recent years and shows that reducing casualties in coal mining is possible. Up to the early 2000s, China’s coal safety record was an international embarrassment and a serious concern throughout Chinese society. During the 1990s, around 6,000 Chinese miners a year, or five people for every one million tons of coal produced, died in the mines. This compared to only 130 deaths, or 0.5 people for every million tons in India, not to mention the much higher safety levels of other big coal producers such as the United States or Australia.   But in recent years, the situation has dramatically improved, with deaths falling to just over 1000, or 0.3 people for every million tons in 2013. This is still a large number of casualties from coal mining, but given the massive expansion of the industry, still a great achievement. As an emerging power that is similarly reliant on coal, Turkey can look to China to make improvements to its mining culture going forward. A number of factors contributed to the earlier high fatalities in China. The great majority of Chinese coal was, and to a lesser extent still is, mined from underground mines. These are inherently more dangerous than open-cut mines (though that is neither to deny the potential for reducing underground fatalities nor to gainsay the serious environmental implications of open-cast mines).  In particular failure to remove gas from underground mines or to reduce the amount of coal dust in them is often the cause of the largest disasters. In 2005 China experienced three explosions each costing over one hundred lives, and the recent disaster in Turkey originated in an explosion, trapping miners below ground. The Chinese government’s almost exclusive focus on economic growth relegated safety and the necessary investments in safety to a lower priority. At the same time, even the large mines faced serious cost pressures and safety was easy to economise on. Large numbers of small rural mines, mostly using relatively primitive technology, operated largely without supervision and often bribed regulators when they were inspected; their record was by far the worst. Many of these features began to change in the early 2000s. More coal began to be mined by open-cast methods, especially in the newly developing areas of Inner Mongolia. The leadership of Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao (who started life as a geologist) started to put more emphasis on social problems, including coal safety, and passed a series of measures forcing mining companies to invest in equipment to remove gas from the mines.   At the same time booming coal prices helped fund these investments. The government also made accidents more expensive for mining companies by increasing the amount of compensation they had to pay for casualties under their watch. China also closed or consolidated small rural mines – often in the face of local governments and populations who depended on them for income and employment. International expertise was also welcomed, with foreign mine safety experts like New Zealander Dave Feickert playing prominent roles. Improvements in China were also the result of social factors like a tightening of the labour supply, which had previously seemed limitless. This labour squeeze was first felt in the export-oriented factories on the coast. In mining areas, parents are unwilling to allow their only son to risk his life in dangerous pits. Even in the early 2000s, coal experts were asking who would mine China’s coal in 20 years time?  China’s story suggests that there is no single fix, but numerous improvements in standards and safety are possible in the coal mining industry. Of course the immediate factors are technological and organisational, such as the removal of gas or more broadly a shift to open-cut mines. But strong commitment from the state, and a willingness to trade some growth in output for improved safety, is clearly also necessary. Businesses must be presented with incentives for safe production, while having the ability to make the necessary investments. Finally, those incentives will be much greater if the workers have more say and more bargaining power, as happens when the supply of labour begins to decline."

In fact, a mighty battle is now developing in Germany between green fantasists and practical realists. Because renewable energy must by law have priority in supplying the grid, the owners of conventional power stations, finding they have to run plants unprofitably, are so angry that they are threatening to close many of them down. The government response, astonishingly, has been to propose a new law forcing them to continue running their plants at a loss.”

The European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) presents an open letter authored by a CDU (Conservative Party) councilman to Hanover treasurer Dr. Marc Hansmann.
Dissent is growing and skepticism is taking root in Germany, as one prominent figure after another begin to speak out. This all goes back to Prof. Fred Singer’s visit to Germany 2010, which produced an uproar, especially among the Greens and Socialists.
EIKE writes:
For years all political parties in Germany have been simply parroting the rallying cries concerning the supposedly anthropogenic CO2 caused “climate catastrophe”. Hardly a single politician has made the effort to check over these claims and to review the extensive literature of the so-called skeptics. This blind trust in a completely politicized, state-funded research along with the one sided reporting of the German(!) media appears to be disappearing as of late. This seems to have been sparked by the hearing with Professor Fred Singer 2010 by a parliamentary group led by Ms Marie-Luise Dött (CDU), and then followed up by two conferences on climate change and energy by the FDP Free Democrats in Saxony (30 June 2012 and 1 December 2012 respectively). Now we have this very recent open letter from CDU councilman and Hanover CDU faction chairman Kurt Fischer. The letter addresses the unkind attacks from Dr. Hansmann on Mr. Fischer, who now takes the occasion to respond.”
What follows next is the open letter by Kurt Fischer to Dr. Hansmann, in English:
—————————————————–
From: Kurt Fischer Councilman of the CDU in Hanover
To: Dr. Marc Hansmann
 Treasurer of the Hanover State Capital
 Date: 14 Nov 2012
Dear Dr. Hansmann,
With the statement that Hurricane Sandy was a consequence of climate change, you are only reflecting the overall media depiction. To the contrary – a scientific examination does not support this claim:
1. The data from the institutes close to the IPCC show that no global warming has been measured in 14 years:
Source: http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/nh+sh; supplemented with text and a trend arrow.
On this subject, the Director of the English UEA/CRU Institute, Prof. Phil JONES, in an interview (see chart above):
“Professor Jones also conceded the possibility that the world was warmer in medieval times than now – suggesting global warming may not be a man-made phenomenon. And he said that for the past 15 years there has been no statistically significant warming.” http://www.dailymailClimategate-U-turn-html; Interview in Daily Mail, 15 Feb 2010.
You don’t need to search out a “skeptic” to confirm the above shown graphic, as even the rather alarmist German science and serious scientists confirm precisely the same, e.g. Prof. Dr. Jochem MAROTZKE (Director of the Max Planck Inst. Hamburg):
“According to our preliminary calculations, it should get much warmer quickly in the next few years. But we do not have confidence in these prognoses. This is because the simulation should have shown the current temperature stagnation – which it failed to do.” DER SPIEGEL, 27 Feb 2012, p. 113.
“Therefore the models are not consistent with the currently observed climate development,” admits Jochem Marotzke, Director of the Hamburg Max Planck Institute for Meteorology. FOCUS: (http://www.focus.de/wissen.html; 16 April 2012).

2. Using hurricane statistics with regards to wind strength, Sandy is at most average:
 http://www.climatedepot-Sandy-Reactions.
Meteorologically it was somewhat unusual, but it is in no way unusual that a hurricane struck the US East Coast. This is the only reason why there was extreme damage. That was due to a particular weather pattern and had nothing at all to do with “climate change”:
http://www.eike-klima-alarmisten
3. The IPCC also found no increasing extreme weather trend:
 “Recent analyses in changes in severe local weather (tornadoes, thunder days, lightning and hail) in a few selected regions provide no compelling evidence for widespread systematic long-term changes“. (Source: IPCC, 2001, TAR-02-2, Chapt. 2.7.4., Summary, S.163-164).
Also an IPCC special report before the climate conference in Durban (2011) reached the same conclusion. Source: http://www.eike-extremwetter-fehlanzeige
Worldwide statistics from the weather agencies also found no extreme-weather trends:
Source: http://www.eike-extremwetterlagen/
Also the repeated claims by the insurance companies that there are greater damages because of extreme weather failed to hold up against scrutiny.
Source: http://www.eike-neues-aus-der-anstalt/ and www.kaltesonne.de  and http://www.eike-wirklichkeit-ist-das-anders/.
Dear Dr. Hansmann, I am amazed to see even intelligent people parroting time and again the media statements that are related to these “dubious claims” coming from the profiteers and ideologues of “climate planet rescuers “, all based on shaky science. I think it would be fabulous if indeed more “intelligent people” gave more effort to think for themselves and to doublecheck!
We especially have to protect ourselves from politicians who implement very costly so-called “climate protection measures” that are based on dubious and unsecured science. There will come a day where we will be judged on this.
With regards to this, Prof. Dr. Heinrich Miller, Vice President of the Alfred Wegener Institute, said in an interview on “climate protection”:
“Those who speak of climate protection are only creating illusions.“ Miller calls on toning it down: “Climate is not something that can be protected and it doesn’t allow itself to be stabilized at a desired temperature. It has dramatically changed in the past also without the influence of man.“ Source: DIE ZEIT, Bohrer im Eis, 06 June 2007 , p.40

Share this...FacebookTwitterSo just how bad is the Arctic ice melt this year? Listening to the alarmists you’d think the world’s ice supply was rapidly dwindling.
When dealing with such phenomena, you have got to pull your eyeballs back a little and take a look at the entire picture to put things in their proper perspective.
The headlines are that Arctic ice melt will reach a record low since satellite measurements have been taken (all the way back to the 1970s, i.e. roughly a whole half an AMO cycle – sarc off).
So how much more Arctic sea ice has melted (been dispersed) this year? Let’s say the Arctic sea ice retreats to 3.5 million km2 by mid September. That would mean 800,000 sq. km less than 2007. That sounds frightening. But how much ice is that? Answer: 800,000 km2 x 0.002 km thick = 1600 cubic km. Holy moly!
Now, how much is that in relation the world’s total ice volume? This is important to know. If it’s 2 or 3%, then we will need to worry.
Using the numbers from Wikipeda we can calculate a rough inventory:
1. Antarctica continent:
Area = 13,700,000 km2 covered with ice
Mean ice thickness: 1.6 km
Ice volume: 21,920,000 km3
2. Antarctica sea ice (Aug):
Area 15,000,000 km2
Mean sea ice thinkness: 0.002 km (rough conservative estimate)
Antarctica sea ice volume = 30,000 km3
3. Greenland
Ice volume (Wikipedia) = 2,850,000 km3

4. Arctic sea ice
Area, September 2007: 4.3 million km2
Average ice thickness: 0.002 km
Total September Arctic sea ice volume = 8600 km3
Adding them up, it yields a total ice volume of: 24,808,600 cubic km stockpiled on the planet (neglecting the glaciers on mountains, which are puny in comparison).
This year in the Arctic, I estimate (see above) that a “whopping” 1600 km3 more Arctic sea ice will have melted by mid September. Yes, 1600 km3 from the total of almost 25 million we have stocked on Earth!
How much is that in percent? (1600 / 24,808,600) x 100 =
0.006%
0.006% more of the world’s ice melted this year. At this rate it’ll take 166 years to see a 1% reduction. This is like taking a glass of ice from a frozen swimming pool. The number is so small that it is outside the statistical margins of certainty. Scientists are not even sure how thick the ice is at many locations. As one reader points out: we are talking about parts per million here! 🙂  
This is why it’s just plain stupid to hysterically focus on a thin film of ice at one pole. It’s utter nonsense. Ice-free Arctics happened in the past and are nothing new.
So with the wave of hysteria about to be unleashed by the merchants and prophets of doom in the days and weeks ahead, it will do everyone some good and keep it all in perspective.
Not only should the focus expand beyond the Arctic, but it also has to expand back beyond the cool days of Ronald Reagan. If you want a clear picture of the Arctic, go back and look at the entire Holocene.
Yes, the climate is a little warmer than 30 years ago, and so a little more ice (0.006%) is going to melt. How astonishing.

Investment companies that run index funds—which merely seek to replicate the ups and downs of a broader market index and that entail no investment strategy by any managers—are becoming ever more popular, with a greater proportion of our retirement savings are going into them. Forty percent of all stock is currently held in such passively managed funds, and three large investment companies with popular index funds—Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street—together hold nearly $13 trillion in assets.



Index funds can be great investments for the middle class, since management fees are low that means net returns are higher, and in the long run they tend to outperform nearly every actively‐​managed stock market fund offered. The SEC recognizes the benefits they deliver and it has simpler filing requirements for investors that do not seek to exert an active control over a company.



However, these behemoths do manage to exert their influence over the companies they invest in via their proxies. Given their size,​they each control​a significant percentage of each company in the S&P 500, which means they have the potential to tip the scales on contentious proxy proposals by voting together on shareholder proposals to change corporate governance.





Once people come to see that some of their money is being spent on activities that have nothing to do with performance we may engender some genuine competition between index funds.



In the last decade they have begun to exert their growing, collective influence in an attempt to improve corporate behavior and procedures companies, with some success: The ten‐​year poison pill is nearing extinction, there are many fewer classified boards these days, and nearly 90 percent of companies in the S&P 500 have majority voting requirements.



However, of late these funds have been increasingly using their proxies to vote for proposals that are tangential to corporate governance, and some these hold the potential to hurt the bottom line of the companies being targeted. First and foremost of these, of course, is the increasing predilection for activists to introduce proposals to force the company to do more about climate change than would be prudent if they were to follow their fiduciary duty. For instance, earlier this year, Vanguard CEO F. William McNabb III released a letter to public companies outlining the priorities of its investment stewardship group, with specific reference to climate change.



With index funds increasingly likely to support such proposals it is likely that we will see more of these in the coming years, the result of which will do nothing to reduce climate change but will increase the cost of doing business for companies large and small.



Another increasingly common proposal has been to force companies to review their charitable giving, with an eye towards potential human rights issues—defined broadly—that might be affected through such giving.



The increasing support that index funds have been giving proxy proposals peripheral to a company’s bottom line (and potentially deleterious to its stock price) may be a manifestation of the greater indexation of the U.S. stock market. A point that Bloomberg’s Matt Levine has made in myriad ways in his always‐​informative daily column Moneystuff is that if fund managers are paid largely based on performance relative to their peers, then the sole motivation for index fund “managers” is to reduce their fees.



What happens to any individual stock is of no consequence to them, since it impacts their index fund peers equally. As a consequence it is easy to conceive of them agreeing to pursue strategies that might not be best for their clients whose money they “manage” but that give them some sort of nonpecuniary satisfaction—like the admiration of their friends or laudatory coverage in the press for their prescience or “courage.”



Fixing this potential moral hazard is tricky: Most people would probably agree that, presently, the benefits of indexation currently outweigh its potential drawbacks, so outlawing index funds doesn’t make sense for the foreseeable future and is probably impossible to boot.



But one thing we could potentially do would be to request that these funds provide more information to their millions of passive investors informing them of the extent and cost of the activities they undertake with regards to proxy voting. We might consider allowing investors with money in these funds to ask why they vote the way they do, or why they choose to vote at all on these peripheral proxies.



Once people come to see that some of their money is being spent on activities that have nothing to do with performance we may engender some genuine competition between index funds.

ThinkProgress discussion of the tornado outbreak – click image for the full article
 Further Update:
Turns out I was hoping for too much.  Brad Johnson found at least three scientists eager to be quoted in his follow up article:  Kevin Trenberth, Michael Mann, and Gavin Schmidt.  The quotes from these top scientists are worth going over there and reading.  No additional comments are warranted.
Top Climate Scientist On The Monster Tornadoes: ‘It Is Irresponsible Not To Mention Climate Change’       
Update by Ryan Maue:
Under the title of “Tornado and global warming“, Brad Johnson disgustingly uses quotes by Dr. Kevin Trenberth, and grotesquely blames the recent tornado outbreak on (GOP) congressional delegations in states that opposed climate legislation.  I hope no scientist wants anything like this said on their behalf.
Update by Anthony:

4:45PM PST I have an updated article on this issue here:
http://wattsupwiththat.com/2011/04/29/the-folly-of-linking-tornado-outbreaks-to-climate-change/
9:30AM PST:

I was writing simultaneously with Ryan Maue and I couldn’t even come up with a title I was so disgusted. So I made the title “No title”. I’ve combined the articles. This is what I wrote:

This post has no title because the closest title I can think of is of the caliber of [expletive deleted]. The Center for American Progress and NCAR’s Dr. Keneth Trenbert invoke the thought of famous line from Joseph N. Welch “Have you no sense of decency, sir?”
I wonder how long they had to search for this particular (uncredited) photograph, choosing the juxapostion of the Chevron sign with the tornado. For all I know, it may even be photoshopped. (update: After about 30 minutes of searching, I found the original here http://yfrog.com/h232uwjij )

To say I’m disgusted, simply does not do justice to the feelings I have about this. The real test will be to see if CAP paid disinformer Joe Romm reposts this article from Brad Johnson on Climate Progress.
Here’s the proof that refutes the issue, and pigeonholes these clowns for what they are, which is nothing about science, but about hateful political cheapshots.

Leave it to the NY Times to Write an Inaccurate and Insensitive Article
I had planned on moving on to other topics today. There is little more to say about the tornadoes of the last three weeks until the investigations are completed. As I was going through my email this morning, a reader sent me a link to this article inThe New York Times:  
Predicting Tornadoes: It’s Still Guessing Game
Compared to the slime job by the Center for American Progress, it’s tame.
I urge readers to read this article below from Physorg and to use it and the graph above to refute comments in online forums.
“…it would be a mistake to blame climate change for a seeming increase in tornadoes”

"**A total of 13 residents at an East Dunbartonshire care home have died in a Covid-19 outbreak.**
The owners of Mavisbank care home in Bishopbriggs confirmed the deaths and said that a further seven residents had also tested positive for the virus.
Another 11 staff members were self-isolating following positive tests.
The Care Inspectorate rated the home in Lennox Crescent as ""weak"" in its Covid-19 response in an inspection last month.
At the unannounced check on 26 October, inspectors found the cleanliness of the home a ""significant concern"".
It went on to describe the cleanliness of the environment and the overall fabric of the building as ""poor"".
Inspectors said in their report that they were ""very concerned about the potential risk of infection for residents"".
Senior managers responded immediately and maintenance staff were deployed to clean the home.
However, the operators were ordered to carry out a deep clean of the facility by 11 November.
Mavisbank owners HC-One said they were monitoring the situation closely.
A spokeswoman said: ""Our thoughts and sympathies are with all families who have lost a loved one from coronavirus.
""As we navigate this outbreak, we continue to work closely with all the relevant authorities to contain the virus and safeguard our residents.
""We are pleased that a number of residents have now recovered, and we continue to closely monitor the health and wellbeing of all those affected.
""This includes following all government guidance in relation to infection prevention and control.""
Responding to the Care Inspectorate report, the company said the health, safety and wellbeing of its residents and staff was a priority.
The spokeswoman said: ""We were disappointed that inspectors found some elements of our robust infection control plan were not being fully implemented and we acted urgently to respond to this feedback. These issues were immediately rectified so that when inspectors returned, they were able to see and approve of the work that had been completed.
""Senior staff are also supporting the home and our learning and development team are ensuring that all colleagues complete refresher training which includes our specific coronavirus training modules on the virus, enhanced infection control procedures, and the correct use of PPE.
""These training modules have been regularly updated to reflect all changes in the guidance over recent months.""
Caroline Sinclair, of East Dunbartonshire Health and Social Care Partnership, said, ""We are aware of this very sad situation and have been working with Mavisbank care home to provide a high level of clinical support to residents at this difficult time. Our thoughts are with the families of those who have passed and others affected by their loss."""
"**Police Scotland issued 33 fixed penalty fines during the first five days of the country's tough new Covid travel restrictions.**
Figures released by the force reveal nine fines were handed out in the Lothians and Scottish Borders.
The other hotspots were Greater Glasgow and Lanarkshire, which both recorded eight offences.
People living in level three or level four areas should only leave their council areas if deemed ""essential"".
Last Friday more that two million people across 11 council areas were moved to level four, while another 10 local authority areas were in level three.
Fines start at Â£30, doubling to Â£60 if they are not paid within 28 days. Repeat offenders can face fines of up to Â£960.
The Scottish government said the new travel laws, which cover western and central parts of the country, were needed to prevent the virus spreading to areas where it is less prevalent.
And police have repeatedly said enforcement would only be used as a ""last resort"".
During the Scottish government's daily media briefing Health Secretary Jeane Freeman was asked about reports of people being stopped by police close to the border with England.
Ms Freeman said she was unable to comment on operational matters but stressed people need to know the restrictions and exemptions.
Deputy Chief Constable Malcolm Graham said: ""The Chief Constable has said publicly on numerous occasions that we will not be routinely stopping vehicles or setting up road blocks, and that will not change as a result of travel restrictions now being in law.
""However, officers may in the course of their duties come across people who are travelling from one local authority area to another.
""In areas where travel restrictions apply, officers will continue to use the common sense, discretion and excellent judgement that they have applied since the crisis began.""
The force was unable to provide details about any of the cases which resulted in a fine.
The statistics for fixed penalty notices linked to the travel regulations, cover the period from 18:00 last Friday to Wednesday.
Multiple offences were only recorded in two other police divisions. In Tayside there were two fines give out, while in Renfrewshire & Inverclyde there were also two.
The total was made up by single fines issued in North East, Forth Valley and Ayrshire.
The force's weekly Covid-19 bulletin also shows police issued a total of 392 fixed penalty notices for virus-related offences - including the travel fines - in the week to 25 November and made 37 arrests."

In recorded human history, no set of political institutions have outlived those of the Venetian Republic. Founded in the ashes of the Roman Empire, it survived as an independent republic until it was captured by Napoleon in 1797. Throughout its existence, it displayed a remarkable degree of political stability; furthermore, it was a place of relative prosperity and a hub of Mediterranean trade. In the 17th century, the nominal wages of unskilled laborers in Venice were higher than anywhere else in Europe, with the exception of Spain, which was coping with the inflow of specie from the New World.



One reason for Venice’s political exceptionalism, according to the historian Thomas Madden, was that Venice “lacked inalienable land. Instead, it was a city of liquid wealth and commerce.” Mr. Madden, a professor of medieval history at St. Louis University, recently wrote an authoritative history of Venice, focusing in great detail on the political environment of the city‐​state.



Over time, intricate political institutions developed, which not only ensured peaceful transfers of power but also restricted the power of the executive and created a climate conducive to business. Because Venice had no land and no natural resources, there was no point in setting up extractive feudal institutions, which were pervasive in Europe at that time. Instead, its institutions emerged to protect commerce, rather than extract resources—although evidence suggests that the capture of the government by the merchants later contributed to the economic stagnation of the city‐​state.



At any rate, some of the quirks of the Venetian political system seem to be prescient institutional inventions. Probably the best illustration is the procedure used to elect the chief magistrate, the Doge, which combined several elements that might improve the functioning of our contemporary political systems.





The study of Venice’s peculiar political institutions is valuable for our thinking about reform of Western political institutions.



On the morning after a Doge’s death the members of the “Maggior Consiglio,” the council representing the freemen of the city, convened to first select by lot 30 of its members older than 30 years, who were designated as “electors.” But if—perhaps by analogy to the U.S. Electoral College—you think that the 30 then simply elected the Doge, you’re mistaken.



Those 30 were reduced to 9 by lot. The 9 then designated a group of 40, each of whom needed 7 approval votes out of the 9 members of the committee. Back in the hall, with the entire Maggior Consiglio present, these 40 would be reduced by lot to 12. As before, the 12 would nominate 25 names, subject to approval by 9 members of the committee. In the hall, these 25 would be reduced to 9. In turn, the 9 nominated 5 names each, commanding the support of at least 7 members of the group. Those 45 would be reduced by lot to 11, and then nominate the 41 true electors of the Doge.



Only then would the real election begin. The 41 were kept isolated in the ducal palace until the Doge was elected. Each member of the “Quarantuno” could nominate a candidate. In the early years, a name would be picked at random, and a yes/​no vote would be held. This would be repeated until a candidate was found who had the support of 25 members. Later on, this sequential procedure was changed to simultaneous approval vote, where each member of the Quarantuno votes yes or no on each of the nominated candidates. The candidate with the highest number of votes would be elected as the new Doge, provided that he had the attained at least 25 yes votes.



The complex voting and randomization procedure was connected to a broader set of rules curbing electoral patronage, corruption, and factions. As Coggins and Perali put it,



Office holders were not permitted to succeed themselves, though many spent their careers moving from one office to another. No family was permitted more than one member on the Ducal Council or any significant nominating committee or administrative board. A nominee’s relatives were prohibited from voting in an election involving him. Campaigns were entirely forbidden; men were sought by offices rather than the other way round. Once elected to an office a person was required to serve, and a heavy fine was levied against those who declined.



While at first sight this electoral procedure seems needlessly complicated and whimsical, it had several desirable properties, which arguably contributed to its stability over time. It is not a stretch to imagine that our current political systems could be improved by emulating the following three features of Venetian political life.



Firstly, the elections of the Doge relied on an iteration of supermajority decisions. The consecutive votes required majorities ranging from 77.8 percent in the initial nomination by the committee of 9 to 61 percent in final election by the Quarantuno. Since Buchanan and Tullock, political economists tend to like supermajorities, because they make it more difficult to impose costs on minorities and curb winner‐​takes‐​all behavior.



Secondly, the element of randomness introduced into the election, as well as the complexity of the procedures, reduced the scope for strategic behavior and functioned as a truth‐​revealing mechanism. With the exception of the Quarantuno, there was no predictable link between the choices of consecutive committees and the outcome—the election of a particular candidate as a Doge. In other words, the electors acted as if behind a veil of ignorance and had little incentives to either misrepresent their preferences or to act in a narrow material interest.



Thirdly, at the final stage of the election process, approval voting was used. Political scientists have shown that, under plausible assumptions, approval voting encourages sincere voting, reflective of people’s true preferences. If one is allowed to cast votes for multiple candidates, there is little reason not to vote for one’s favorite candidate, even if one thinks that she has only a small chance of being elected. It is striking to see the Venetians stumble upon approval voting centuries ago before its desirable properties were documented by scholars—and indeed well before economists or political scientists started to think systematically about the implications of different decision‐​making rules.



According to Mr. Madden, Venetian institutions prevented both the rise of ambitious tyrants and mob rule. Regardless of whether one agrees with that assessment or not, the study of Venice’s peculiar political institutions is valuable for our thinking about reform of Western political institutions. True, Venice did not have an open political system and was certainly no libertarian paradise. Yet, at the very least, its example seems to strengthen, rather than weaken, the case for the increased use of supermajorities and truth‐​revealing mechanisms, possibly involving randomization and/​or approval voting.

It’s no coincidence that Greens voters tend to be the wealthiest, most urbanised in Australia. Environmentalism is the ultimate First World Problem. Only rich people can afford to fret about whether their almond milk is sustainably-sourced, organic and carbon-neutral, or whether to put expensive solar panels on their roofs. Poor people are too preoccupied with being able to eat and keep warm.



China and India, not to mention other developing nations, are a long way from being wealthy and electrified enough to give a toss about carbon emissions. Even working-class and rural Westerners pay little more than lip-service to climate-fussing. That stuff is the preserve of the comfortable, well-off, well-fed greens of the inner cities.



But climate policy is non-existent or failing even more markedly in the rest of the world for a very simple reason: more energy means more income, longer lives, less disease and more education. Typically, the cheapest way to achieve this is through coal.



The International Energy Agency’s newest report finds that when adjusting for the unreliability of solar and wind, existing coal will be cheaper than new solar and wind everywhere at least until 2040, and dramatically so in the EU. This simple fact is the reason we do not yet have a solution to global warming: green energy mostly can’t yet compete globally with fossil fuels.



The climate divide was starkly demonstrated in the recent Australian election. Labor and the Greens proposed big-spending, grandiose climate policies, but the bulk of the country voted with their feet. Labor’s great, big climate policies like electric cars were a massive electoral dud.



Promises to populate the world with electric cars have failed just as spectacularly, despite unpreced­ented subsidies. Today, fewer than 0.3 per cent of all cars are electric, and even if we could reach 200 million electric cars in 2040, the IEA estimates this would ­reduce emissions by less than 1 per cent.



Twenty years ago, the green-left tried to crucify John Howard for refusing to ratify the Kyoto Treaty. History showed that he was right.



The promises made in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 and in the Kyoto Treaty in 1997 fell apart. A new study of the promises made under the Paris Agreement finds that of almost 200 signatories, only 17…are living up to them, and these are succeeding mostly because they promised so little…



 **Every election fought on climate policy has been a failure.** Kevin Rudd’s “great moral challenge of our time” won plaudits from the media elite but failed to sway Australians when push came to vote. The Carbon Tax did more than anything to kill support for Julia Gillard. Bill Shorten’s climate-centric election campaign lost him the un-losable election.



Still, they keep coming back.



Failure has not made politicians more careful. If anything, they have doubled down on making nice-sounding promises, even ones that are objectively ludicrous with zero chance of happening.



Enter the queen of ludicrous, reality-defying policies.



…After New Zealand made its 2050 zero emissions promise, the government commissioned a report on the costs. This found that achieving this goal in the most cost-effective manner (which strains credulity because policy seldom if ever manages to be cost efficient) would cost more than last year’s entire national budget on social security, welfare, health, education, police, courts, defence, environment and every other part of government combined. Each and every year.



Is it any wonder that China and India are giving the finger to the climate brigade and burning coal as fast as they can get their hands on it?



China has gone a long way to connecting its citizens to the grid, and India is working hard on catching up. Cheap, reliable energy is fuelling the economic revolution of both nations. The more than one billion people still without electricity in the developing world want their share, too.



If anything, the climate alarmists’ obsession with unreliable, expensive and ineffective “renewables” is diverting attention and money from finding real solutions.



The belief that we already have the solutions is a delusion on a planetary scale. It may be comforting to tell ourselves that global warming is effectively solved. It’s dangerous because it leads to us taking at face value promises and vows that have no chance of being enacted. And it is reckless because it stops us from focusing on what we need to do instead.

"Transforming the energy efficiency of every home, mass rewilding of the countryside, huge investment in cycling, walking and buses, and a “frequent flyer” tax are among a raft of green policies being put forward by the politicians vying to replace Jeremy Corbyn as leader of the Labour party. In answers to 17 questions put by the Guardian before the coronavirus outbreak, all three remaining candidates – Rebecca Long-Bailey, Lisa Nandy and Keir Starmer – set out detailed plans on how they would go about tackling the dual environmental crises of climate breakdown and mass extinction, and shed light on how the party under their leadership would tackle some of the biggest challenges facing the UK, and the world.  In the 2019 election, the climate crisis was more prominent than it has been in any previous contest, and voters and green campaigners are increasingly putting pressure on the leadership candidates to stick to the ambition of the Labour manifesto, which for the first time put tackling the climate emergency at the heart of its offer. Earlier this year, the Labour for a Green New Deal group, which campaigned for the party to adopt a radical economic plan to deal with the crisis in the run-up to the election, sent five questions to each candidate and scored their answers out of 10: Long-Bailey came out on top, with Starmer second and Nandy third. The Guardian also scored all MPs on their record on the climate crisis as part of The polluters series last year. In that analysis, Long-Bailey and Nandy both came out with the maximum score of 100%. Starmer had only been present for two votes, meaning there was insufficient information for him to be given a score. In a clear sign of how deeply embedded a radical environmental agenda has become in Labour policy, all three candidates, answering before the Covid 19 outbreak said the climate crisis was the biggest challenge facing the UK. Both Long-Bailey and Nandy highlighted their previous experience – Long-Bailey as the architect of Labour’s Green New Deal at the last election and Nandy from her time as the party’s shadow energy secretary and her role leading Labour’s team at the Paris climate talks in 2015. All the candidates pledged broad support for Labour’s comprehensive Green New Deal agenda. Both Long-Bailey and Starmer supported the specifics of the plan set out in the 2019 manifesto, spelling out how the UK could rapidly decarbonise the economy and create hundreds of thousands of secure, unionised green jobs. Starmer said the project should be “hardwired” into everything a future Labour government did “from foreign policy to local government, from transport to housing”, and he flagged up the role of the “green transformation fund and a national investment bank” to pay for it. Long-Bailey said that under her leadership Labour would organise and pay for such an ambitious scheme through public ownership and investment in the energy system to ensure “extra costs are not loaded onto homes that can’t afford it”. Nandy did not commit to the details of the plan but agreed there needed to be “a wholesale transformation” in the way homes and businesses were powered and heated, adding that “this is possible and necessary and offers huge economic opportunities”. Asked whether they would commit to greater funding for public transport, cycling and walking than for road building, Long-Bailey said she would, saying it was necessary not just to tackle the climate crisis, but to improve “our economy, the connections between cities and towns, and rural areas, making our public transport more accessible and to encourage healthier lives and cleaner air.” Neither Nandy nor Starmer specifically committed to spending more on public transport, walking and cycling than roads although both said they would increase investment in those areas. Nandy said she would nationalise the railways and hand over control of buses to local councils so they were run “for people not profit”. Starmer said the government had made a “political choice to spend transport budgets on roads rather than greener and cheaper forms of transport”. He added: “I would lead a Labour government with different priorities: building a more sustainable, affordable, accessible and integrated transport system – with investment in bus services, renationalisation of our railways, and support for cycling and pedestrians.” All the candidates expressed interest in a frequent flyer tax to ensure that the 15% of wealthy UK residents who are estimated to take 70% of domestic and international flights pay more for the environmental damage they cause. Nandy said she would look to “make the system fairer and greener”. Long-Bailey said it was right to “ask wealthy frequent flyers to shoulder more responsibility, or reduce the frequency of their flights”. Starmer said the tax system should encourage people to use alternatives to flying. All three said they were opposed to expansion at Heathrow and were sceptical about aviation expansion elsewhere in light of the UK’s legal commitments to reduce carbon emissions. None of the candidates came out against nuclear power. Long-Bailey said she supported it where necessary for the UK’s “energy security”. Nandy said that the middle of a climate emergency was the wrong time to rule it out definitively. Starmer said nuclear power should be “part of the mix” in the transition away from fossil fuels, but the “overwhelming focus” should be on renewables. Asked whether they would support policies to reduce red meat consumption, Nandy said the focus should be on the fossil fuel industry. “The priority for governments must be to focus on the biggest driver of emissions, which is the global fossil fuel industry; but the Committee on Climate Change has made it clear that we also need to think about how we manage our land and produce our food.” Long-Bailey highlighted the growing number of people who are cutting down on red meat “as people think about the environment and their health”, but stopped short of any specific policy commitments. Starmer acknowledged that the meat and dairy sector was “one of the most significant contributors to climate change and, in many countries, deforestation”, adding that everyone should think about how to reduce their consumption. But he added: “Changes in behaviour, important as they are, should not distract us from the systemic nature of the problem of climate change.” Nandy said tackling the climate emergency went “hand-in-hand with restoring our natural environment”. She backed Labour’s existing policy of creating 10 new national nature parks, adding: “I would also enable more people to take control of the management of their local parks, and ensure that local government had the powers and funding to maintain them.” Starmer agreed rewilding was an essential part of the “fightback against the climate and environmental emergency”. “I support ambitious tree-planting schemes and new nature parks to halt the devastating loss of biodiversity and to help in the fight against air pollution which plagues our streets.” Long-Bailey also backed Labour’s existing plans to create new parks and rewild existing ones, as well as “natural corridors” across the country. “These are examples of actions we need to take to tackle the climate crisis, but will also make our cities, towns and local communities nicer and healthier places to live, bringing public luxury to the spaces and services we care about.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterEffective January 1, 2013, oil-burning and natural gas furnaces in new homes are forbidden in Denmark. And beginning in 2016, homeowners will not be allowed to replace their old, existing gas or oil burning furnaces with a new one. Hat-Tip: Readers Edition.de/. Read here, in English.
If you think the green movement has gone off the rails in Germany, just look at neighboring Denmark. Reader’s Edition writes:
The ban of a certain type of heating impacts everyone who is planning to build a new home, which is 1-2% of all homes. But at the latest in 2016, owners of older homes will also be affected.”
As is often the case with bureacrats, they failed to think out the possible consequences. Readers Edition reminds us:
This approach is not without risk. The question arises concerning the safety of an existing heater that goes on the blink just after the 2016 deadline. Will there be a huge temptation to continue running the risky furnace?”

It’s not clear on how Danes plan to stay wwarm in the future. District heating is more common in the Nordic country than in other European countries. Yet district heating accounts only for 35% of all Danish homes, and the heat is generated mostly by gas and oil.
There’s no mention how the other 65% of Danes will keep warm after 2016.
If you’re surprised by Denmark’s radicalism, don’t be. This is the same activist country that imposed a tax on fat back in 2011. Danish bureaucrats obviously thought their citizens were too stupid to know how to properly feed themselves, and so needed the nanny hand of a bureaucrat to spoon-feed them. So it really isn’t a surprise they also have to be taught how to stay warm.
Obviously, the Danes believe that their tiny country cutting back on their share of the world’s CO2 emissions (something like 0.2%) and thus theoretically preventing 0.0000001°C of warming by the year 2100 will rescue the polar bears and immunize people against bad weather.
Their fat tax, by the way, was abolished just a year later.

UPDATE 1: Russian media seems to confirm the new record: http://publicpost.ru/theme/id/3284/oymyakon/! Here it writes:

Село Оймякон — самая холодная точка на планете. На днях тут похолодало до минус 71 градуса — это самая низкая температура за всю историю измерения. Предыдущий рекорд был в 1933 году, когда ударил мороз минус 67,8 градусов.

In English (Bing translation):
The village of Oymyakon is the coldest point on the planet. The other day here it became colder to minus 71 degrees is the lowest temperature ever measured. The previous record was in 1933, when the Frost hit minus 67.8 degrees.”
But others point out that Weather Underground, for example, shows no temperatures being close to that. So the mystery remains. For the time being, there is no record until otherwise officially stated.
====================================
That’s -71.2°C, and it shatters the previous record of -68°C (-90.4°F) set in 1933! Hat-tip DirkH.
There’s been a lot of confusion over the last couple of days concerning a record low temperature allegedly just recorded in Siberia.
It appears that the record was actually set on February 19, in Oymyakon, Siberia.

News website borlife.de/ reports here. It writes near the end:
Oymyakon: Coldest Town in the World – 71 ° Celsius
It was just a few days ago that Oymyakon became famous. With -71° Celsius, it recorded a new record cold temperature, which until then had been unique to 2 villages. Until then the record of -68°C had to be shared with the town of Werchojansk – however, this is now history.”
This Italian site also reports that the new record was just set days ago, on February 19, smashing to pieces the old record of -68°C set in 1933, 80 years ago:
Un nuovo record di freddo è stato stabilito nella giornata di oggi in Siberia. Nella città di Oymyakon è stato raggiunto l’incredibile valore di -71°C! Battuto il precedente record di -68°C che resisteva ormai dal lontano 1933. Tutta la Siberia e la Russia stanno sperimentado una fase di gelo intenso, con -50°C toccati anche nella regione di Dzalinda.”
My Italian isn”t the best, but I’d translate that as follows:
A new record cold was recorded today in Siberia. In the town of Oymyakon the incredible value of -71.2°C was reached. It beat the previous record of -68° C that which stood since 1933. All of Siberia and Russia are in a phase of extreme frost. The area of Dzalinda is hit with -50°C.”
Italian readers may want to improve that translation for me.
Die Welt kept it off the front page, confirmed the temperature reading, but doesn’t call it a “record”, read here.

In the [first part](https://www.thebfd.co.nz/2019/06/demolishing-the-myths-of-renewable-energy-pt-1/) of this series, Danish statistician, environmentalist and climate heretic Bjorn Lomborg roundly debunked the myth that renewables are somehow a “transformational” magic bullet solution to climate change.



Humanity needs cheap, abundant energy, and renewables just can’t cut the mustard. Especially not solar and wind, which remain niche sources of energy. The biggest source of renewable energy, even in advanced societies like the EU, remains burning wood. The EU can use fancy names like “biomass” and pretend that it doesn’t emit carbon dioxide, but that’s only the beginning of renewables’ problems.



First, they take up an amazing amount of space that often rep­laces nature. To replace a 1ha gas-fired power plant, society needs 73ha of solar panels, 239ha of onshore wind turbines or an unbelievable 6000ha of biomass.



In a [remarkable TED talk](https://youtu.be/N-yALPEpV4w) Michael Shellenberger shows how some simple back-of-the-envelope calculations demolishes the fanciful claims of renewables advocates. Not only do renewables have a gargantuan environmental footprint, they’re not even much use.



Second — and most important — solar and wind power are intermittent or unreliable…We often hear that wind and solar energy are cheaper than fossil fuels, but at best that is true only when the wind is blowing or the sun is shining. It is deeply misleading to compare the energy cost of wind or solar to fossil fuels only when it is windy and sunny.



What’s more, because modern society requires 24-hour power, even when solar or wind is introduced, it’s still necessary to pay for back-up service from fossil fuels (for when there’s no wind or sun), only these are now more expensive because fossil fuels have fewer hours to back the capital investment. And batteries are nowhere near ready to help solar and wind energy last longer. In the US, total battery storage could power the nation for only 14 seconds.



But, even if electricity production magically transformed to 100% renewables without sending everyone, broke and freezing, back to the mud and toil of the Middle Ages, it still wouldn’t make a great deal of difference to carbon dioxide emissions.



Electricity constitutes about only a quarter of global emissions.



There is a focus on emissions from electricity because although it is very hard to end our reliance on fossil fuels and solutions are far from effective, it’s actually easier and further ahead than the other sectors: agriculture (24 per cent of emissions), manufacturing (21 per cent), transport (14 per cent), buildings (6 per cent) and other (10 per cent).



Despite the back-slapping of globe-trotting carbon-fussers circle-jerking each other in luxury resorts around the world, ruinously expensive initiatives like the Paris Agreement make bugger-all difference.



Right now, our solutions to ­climate change are failing. We may feel as if we’re doing a lot, but the ­reality is we are mostly tinkering at the margins, often with incredibly ineffective policies.



…While the EU likes to point to its green achievements, more than two-thirds of its energy still comes from fossil fuels. Nuclear energy contributes 13 per cent of CO2-free energy and renewables 15 per cent. And even this figure of 15 per cent is dubious.



The EU adopts the fictitious position that biomass such as wood pellets produce no CO2 at all. The truth is wood emits more CO2 per kilowatt hour than even coal.



That’s only the beginning of the environmental horror story that is the reality of shonky renewable scams.



Moreover, reliance on burning American forests in EU stoves leads to “biodiversity loss, deforestation and forest degradation”, ­according to a European Commission report. This shows the EU’s climate “achievement” — of ­increasing its use of renewables — is mostly deceptive, and the vast part of it is unsustainable.



  
In some African countries, “environmentally conscious” Westerner’s demand for guilt-free “bio-fuels” has seen villagers violently driven from their ancestral lands in order to make way for plantations. Others were lucky just to be left jobless and landless, as promised benefits from bio-fuel companies evaporated.



But that is just the beginning of the toll of human misery that the climate alarmists’ obsession with renewables would wreak…

"After months of deliberation and consultations, the UK government’s long-awaited announcement about a plastic bag charge arrives, only for Defra to shoot it full of holes by opting to exempt retailers with fewer than 250 employees from the 5p charge.  This decision, which would mean tens of thousands of shops will continue to give out single-use plastic bags when the levy comes into effect in 2015, flies in the face of any logic. It has earned the government widespread condemnation, from those in parliament, from environmentalists, and even those stakeholders who would nominally gain from the move, such as the 33,000 members of the Association of Convenience Stores. Research has substantially demonstrated that plastic bags are harmful to the environment. Lightweight bags are carried by winds to litter roadsides, trees, and streets throughout urban and rural landscapes. The thin plastic breaks down in the environment into tiny pieces that lead to the deaths of birds and marine life.  And it has also been shown without doubt that the billions of single-use plastic bags used each year – eight billion in 2012 in England alone – are produced at great cost. It is estimated that the amount of energy needed to make 12 single-use bags could power a car for a mile. Plastics and chemicals related to their manufacture have been linked to human health concerns too.  In our research published in the Journal of Business Ethics, we found that a joined up effort from the government, supermarkets and individuals was the way to bridge the behaviour-attitude gap that seems to persist in the world of consumers. Consumers like to think they are ethical but when pressed as to whether they owned or used a “bag for life” when out shopping, a significant number of them said they owned them, but would forgot to bring them with them.  A decision to levy a universal charge on for all bags in all shops would bring a swift end to such forgetfulness. This is not conjecture – it is exactly what has happened in Wales, Northern Ireland, and in the Irish Republic where there has been a very significant fall in the use of single-use bags. The levy in Ireland saw a drop of 85% within weeks after introduction in 2002, Wales saw a 76% decrease within a year of introduction of a levy in 2011, and in Northern Ireland a decrease of 80% within the first four months.  The environment minister for Northern Ireland Mark Durkan has commended the people of the province and encouraged them to keep up the momentum.  Momentum – that is exactly the reason why we need all shops to be included in this levy. If there is confusion as to which shops will charge and which won’t, if there are loopholes excusing certain shops and not others, then this effort towards curbing pollution, energy use, and saving the environment will be severely curtailed. Already Defra says  the reduction of use may be as low as 60%. That is not good enough. Not when even the Americans are getting on board, with levies or bans proposed or enacted in 132 US cities, from Los Angeles to Chicago to Washington DC. We can do better, and we should."

Navy‐​blue Marylanders have broken form and elected a Republican governor, Larry Hogan, who scored a five‐​point victory last November with a strong message of fiscal responsibility. Other state politicians haven’t gotten the message.



Exhibit A: Prince George’s County Executive Rushern Baker, who last week proposed hiking his constituents’ property taxes by a remarkable 15.6% and boosting spending by 8.2% in the coming fiscal year. Much of the bounty will go to raise teachers’ salaries from the current average of $65,000 to about $75,000.



Never mind the county’s teachers already are paid 15% more than the U.S. average, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. Or that shoveling money at teachers unions mainly delivers their political loyalty rather than educational benefits.



Mr. Baker is betting that county residents will be unable to resist his assurances that this is all “for the children.” But we’ve seen this movie before. In the 1970s the locals went down a similar tax‐​and‐​spend road, saw disaster and changed course.





The would‐​be presidential candidate created a loophole that could be used to bust local property‐​tax caps.



Like most American suburbs, Prince George’s County grew rapidly after World War II; the population increased sevenfold between 1940 and 1970. To cope with the mixed blessings of development and supply a generous array of services to new residents, it spent aggressively on social programs and public works—especially schools. By the mid‐​1970s the property‐​tax burden was the second highest in the state—trailing only Baltimore City, then suffering its third straight decade of population loss (of an eventual six).



Flight from an old industrial city was thought inevitable at the time, but observers were shocked to see that folks in leafy Prince George’s County were also voting with their feet. A 1977 Washington Post article reported that 34,000 county residents left between 1970 and 1976 and pinned much of the blame on local taxes. “I finally said to heck with it,” one Carolina‐​bound retiree told the Post. “ I got tired of fighting the higher costs.”



Fortunately two maverick Democrats—a liberal veteran of state politics named William Goodman and a first‐​time candidate named David Bird—understood the long‐​term threat and responded with a tax‐​limiting county referendum in 1978. Mr. Bird explained simply that “the property tax is running people out of their homes.”



Their “Tax Reform Initiative by Marylanders”—TRIM—won 70% of the vote. Ultimately, it capped the property‐​tax rate under 1% of assessed value and imposed spending discipline on a reluctant political elite. Population growth resumed almost immediately, soaring 21% during the 1980s and ’90s. In 1996 a referendum to repeal TRIM was defeated handily.



Today Prince George’s County is the wealthiest majority‐​black county in the U.S., with a median household income 39% above the national level and a poverty rate 42% below it. Naturally, some of county’s superior performance owes to its proximity to our nation’s capital. But the county is in the same spot as it was in the 1970s, when it shed population and jobs to its neighbors, even as the federal government exploded in size. TRIM reversed the exodus.



A property‐​tax cap, particularly in a liberal jurisdiction, is like a fiscal guardrail. It tells potential investors, “Yes, we’re on the progressive road here, but there’s a limit. We won’t—in fact, we can’t—tax away some of the value of your property whenever politically expedient.” So investors are more likely to make the kinds of long‐​term commitments that fuel job creation, wage growth and stability.



Since TRIM is still in place and highly popular, how does Mr. Baker think he can get away with this capital levy? The state, he believes, has created a loophole allowing him to defy voters and ignore the property‐​tax cap.



In 2012, Maryland’s then‐​Gov. Martin O’Malley signed a bill requiring “maintenance of effort” in education spending by local governments. The law now punishes localities that fail to put school‐​spending growth on autopilot. In partial compensation, the law professes to give local officials “authority to exceed local tax limitations to fund education,” voters be damned.



Mr. Baker is a lame duck, but the budget debates will tell us whether Prince George’s council members are similarly cavalier about public sentiment. Yet even if they roll over politically and give Mr. Baker a blank check, a legal battle would surely follow. It is by no means clear that the loophole on which this plan depends will pass constitutional muster, and that the state may dictate local budget policy and invalidate voter referendums so easily.



Gov. Hogan should relish the constitutional fight. Faced with a Democratic‐​controlled legislature, he has been hard‐​pressed to implement his budget and tax priorities. Challenging maintenance of effort in the courts might be his best chance to overturn the automatic spending formulas that have led to Maryland’s chronic structural deficits and, as well, to protect local sovereignty.



Preserving the fiscal guardrail in Prince George’s County and the four other Maryland counties with the wisdom to have installed them will encourage investment in a state with an overall business climate that the Tax Foundation has ranked 40th in the nation for three years running. Without them, we veer left—into a ditch.

Burma’s agony continues. The military dictatorship held a rigged election Nov. 14 to cloak itself in civilian garb. The people of Burma will continue to suffer under one of the worst governments on Earth.



Nearly a half century after the military seized power, the country is ruled by a junta headed by Gen. Than Shwe. The military’s crimes are many: imposing a corrupt and brutal dictatorship, conducting a genocidal war against dissident ethnic groups, suppressing civil and political liberties, impoverishing the country, and enriching political elites.



In 1990 the junta foolishly held an election. The Burmese people overwhelmingly voted for Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy. So the generals voided the result, suppressed the NLD, and quarantined Suu Kyi, subjecting her to house arrest for 15 of the last 21 years.





The people of Burma will continue to suffer under one of the worst governments on Earth.



The junta decided to hold another election, but rigged this one from the start.



There was no independent election commission and/​or foreign observers. No electioneering, let alone criticism of the government, was permitted. Elaine Pearson, deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch, complained that the vote was “conducted in a climate of fear, intimidation and resignation.”



Some 2000 imprisoned democracy activists, including Suu Kyi and many other NLD members, were deemed ineligible to run. The NLD, the nation’s only legitimate governing force, therefore refused to participate and was forcibly disbanded by the regime. In contrast, the generals fielded “civilian” candidates for every office through the misnamed United Solidarity and Development Party.



All parties were required to affirm support for the 2008 constitution imposed by the junta. That document reserves one‐​fourth of the lower house and one‐​third of the upper house to the military, allows the “civilian” president to turn power over to the military, creates a National Defense and Security Council, and permits the military‐​controlled Union Election Commission to dismiss legislators.



The Burmese people understood that the generals would remain in charge. Ashin Issariya of the All Burma Monks Alliance observed: “It will be the same faces and the same system that we have been living with for decades. The name ‘elections’ does not change anything for us.”



Instead, the junta’s objective was an image makeover. Today the regime is reviled around the world and subject to U.S. and European sanctions.



The fact that the rigged election offers no prospect of change doesn’t mean the West should maintain its policy of isolation and sanctions. This strategy has manifestly failed. Today’s only winner is China, which has achieved disproportionate influence in Rangoon.



It is time to move in the opposite direction.



The U.S. should not aid the junta’s attempt to disguise its malign character. After a decent interval, however, Washington should consult with European and leading Asian states to forge a united strategy to press Burma for reform.



The U.S. government’s ability to influence events in Rangoon is limited. Broader international support, especially in Southeast Asia, is required for any hope of progress.



No policy offers much likelihood of success. But promising to eschew attempts at coercive regime change while offering rewards for political liberalization might provide the best, if still not a good, strategy to promote real change. It is the best of a bad set of options.

As warm records are set in germany, people over a vast area of Asia are moaning under a record cold. Russia is gripped by the worst winter since 1938, where already more than 90 people have frozen to death. Also in India and China people are suffering from the extreme cold.”
The video says Russia’s winter has been far too cold so far, with temperatures 15°C below normal. District heating systems have frozen up, people’s homes have lost heat. Many are forced to melt snow to get drinking water.
The cold extends to India, where 26 people have died. In China the mercury has plummeted to – 37°C. Snowstorms have snarled traffic.
Although relief has arrived in Eastern Europe and Moscow, none is in sight for Siberia, Mongolia, India, China for the week ahead (also see above chart):

"Few places on the planet are more at risk from the climate crisis than south Florida, where more than 8 million residents are affected by the convergence of almost every modern environmental challenge – from rising seas to contaminated drinking water, more frequent and powerful hurricanes, coastal erosion, flooding and vanishing wildlife and habitat. If scientists are right, the lower third of the state will be underwater by the end of the century. Yet despite this grim outlook, scientists, politicians, environment groups and others are tackling the challenges head on. Below are some of the biggest threats posed by the climate crisis to south Florida today, along with solutions under consideration. Some of these solutions will have a lasting impact on the fight. Others, in many cases, are only delaying the inevitable. But in every situation, doing something is preferable to doing nothing at all. The threat: By any estimation, Florida is drowning. In some scenarios, sea levels will rise up to 31in  by 2060, a devastating prediction for a region that already deals regularly with tidal flooding and where an estimated 120,000 properties on or near the water are at risk. The pace of the rise is also hastening, scientists say – it took 31 years for the waters around Miami to rise by six inches, while the next six inches will take only 15 more. At such a rate, many of Miami Beach’s landmarks, the world famous South Beach, and the picturesque art deco hotels of Ocean Drive, will be lost within three decades, according to some studies. Possible solutions: Dozens of municipalities, the four counties of south-east Florida, and partner groups such as the Nature Conservancy have combined their efforts through the south-east regional action climate plan to tackle the crisis. In Miami Beach, dubbed the “ground zero” of sea rise, a multifaceted and costly Rising Above program is already under way. It includes elevating roads, building new sea walls and installing new and higher capacity pumps and drainage systems to alleviate flooding. In the Florida Keys, the approach will probably tilt more towards managed retreat: abandoning areas too expensive to maintain and focusing on measures with a better cost-benefit ratio. Parts of the Keys are going to simply disappear, some within two decades. The cost: The participating counties and municipalities are contributing to a $4bn statewide spend, including Miami Beach’s $400m Forever Bond, a $1bn stormwater plan and $250m of improvements to Broward county’s sewage systems to protect against flooding and seawater seepage. In the Keys, many consider the estimated $60m a mile cost of raising roads too expensive. The threat: Saltwater from sea level rise is seeping further inland through Florida’s porous limestone bedrock and contaminating underground freshwater supplies, notably in the Biscayne aquifer, the 4,000-sq mile shallow limestone basin that provides drinking water to millions in southern Florida. Years of over-pumping and toxic runoff from farming and the sugar industry in central Florida and the Everglades have worsened the situation. The Florida department of environmental protection warned in March that “existing sources of water will not adequately meet the reasonable beneficial needs for the next 20 years”. A rising water table, meanwhile, has exacerbated problems with south Florida’s ageing sewage systems. Since December, millions of gallons of toxic, raw sewage have spilled on to Fort Lauderdale’s streets from a series of pipe failures. Possible solutions: A comprehensive 30-year Everglades restoration plan was authorized by Congress in 2000 to “restore, preserve and protect” the south Florida ecosystem by improving water flows to help flush the salinity, and a 78bn-gallon Everglades agricultural area reservoir (EAA), a key component of the congressional plan, is earmarked for land once leased by big sugar. The restoration plan, however, has stalled amid funding wrangles, and the storage reservoir plan delayed several times. The cost: The Everglades restoration plan was originally priced at $7.8bn, rose to $10.5bn, and has since ballooned to $16.4bn. Donald Trump’s proposed 2021 federal budget includes $250m for Everglades restoration. The estimated $1.8bn cost of the reservoir will be split between federal and state budgets. The threat: In October 2018, Hurricane Michael made landfall in the Florida Panhandle as the first category 5 cyclone to strike the US since 1992. In the devastating hurricane season just one year before, major storms named Harvey, Maria and Irma combined to cause damage estimated at $265bn. Scientists have evidence the climate crisis is causing cyclones to be more powerful, and intensify more quickly, and Florida’s position at the end of the Atlantic Ocean’s “hurricane alley” makes it twice as vulnerable as any other state. Possible solutions: Previous efforts to tame hurricanes were a failure, and experts see mitigation strategies, including more robust building codes, as the best defense. Hurricane Andrew in 1992, which destroyed more than 63,000 houses, led to the implementation of a statewide construction code that is updated every three years, though there are regional variations, and criticisms that industry lobbyists have too much sway. The cost: With homeowners and businesses largely bearing their own costs, the specific amount spent on “hurricane-proofing” in Florida is impossible to know. A 2018 Pew research study documented $1.3bn in hazard mitigation grants from federal and state funding in 2017, along with a further $8bn in post-disaster grants. Florida is spending another $633m from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development on resiliency planning. The threat: Florida’s native flora and fauna are being devastated by climate change, with the Florida Natural Areas Inventory warning that a quarter of the 1,200 species it tracks is set to lose more than half their existing habitat, and the state’s beloved manatees and Key deer are at risk of extinction. Warmer and more acidic seas reduce other species’ food stocks and exacerbate the deadly red-tide algal blooms that have killed incalculable numbers of fish, turtles, dolphins and other marine life. Bleaching and stony coral tissue disease linked to the climate crisis threaten to hasten the demise of the Great Florida Reef, the only living coral reef in the continental US. Encroaching saltwater has turned Big Pine Key, a crucial deer habitat, into a ghost forest. Possible solutions: The diverse range of challenges requires a piecemeal approach. A state and federally funded “Noah’s ark” is collecting and preserving coral chunks at venues including Nova Southeastern University as disease research continues. A new state taskforce of marine scientists and biologists is tackling the blue-green algae outbreaks that have choked Florida’s inland waterways. As for the Key deer, of which fewer than 1,000 remain, volunteers leave clean drinking water to replace salt-contaminated watering holes as herds retreat to higher ground. A longer-term debate is under way on the merits and ethics of relocating the species to other areas of Florida or the US. The cost: Florida is spending $4m in the current financial year for expanded water quality analytics related to “nutrient over-enrichment” and $3m annually for the next five years on Red Tide research. A 20-year project backed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to restore 3m sq feet of the Great Florida Reef is estimated at $100m. Such projects can only scratch the surface of the incalculable investment that will be needed to save the states species and their habitats. The threat: Tourist brochures showcase miles of golden, sandy beaches in South Florida, but the reality is somewhat different. The Florida department of environmental protection deems the entire coastline from Miami to Cape Canaveral “critically eroded”, the result of sea level rise, historically high tides and especially storm surges from a succession of powerful hurricanes. In south-eastern Florida’s Palm Beach, Broward, Miami-Dade and Monroe counties, authorities are waging a continuous war on sand loss, eager to maintain their picture-perfect image and protect two of their biggest sources of income, tourism dollars and lucrative property taxes from waterfront homes and businesses. Possible solutions: With the other option abandoning beaches to the elements, city and county commissions have little choice but costly replenishment projects with sand replacement and jetty construction. Federal law prohibits the importation of cheaper foreign sand, so the municipalities must source a more expensive alternative from US markets, often creating friction with residents who don’t want to part with their sand. Supplementary to sand replenishment, the Nature Conservancy is a partner in a number of nature-based coastal defense projects from West Palm Beach to Miami. The cost: Authorities usually match federal funding for replenishment projects. An $8m project restored almost 125,000 cubic yards to three Broward county beaches last winter, and $55m will be spent on a 400,000-sq yd restoration on three others beginning in the fall. The region’s showpiece, Miami Beach, benefited from 61,000 cubic yards of new sand this year at a cost of $16m. Statewide, Florida spends an average $50m annually on beach erosion. The threat: “Climate gentrification” is a buzzword around south Florida, a region barely 6ft above sea level where land has become increasingly valuable in elevated areas. Speculators and developers are eyeing historically black, working-class and poorer areas, pushing out long-term residents and replacing affordable housing with upscale developments and luxury accommodations that only the wealthy can afford. In Miami, the controversial Magic City Innovation District in the neighborhood of Little Haiti is a billion-dollar, 17-acre, towering behemoth blending commercial, residential, entertainment and hotel space. It has drawn legal action from locals who say their rights have been trampled. Possible solutions: Experts argue there are ways to lessen the impact of climate gentrification on local populations without the need for displacement, such as providing affordable working space and housing for existing residents, and using sustainable construction practices and environmentally friendly materials. Magic City’s developers insist they are committed to the neighborhood, including below-market-cost housing. Local authorities and activist groups are working to “protect” areas by investing in revitalization and affordable housing projects. The cost: No study has yet calculated the overall cost of affordable housing lost to the climate crisis. Private developers will bear the expense of mitigating the impact on the neighborhood – $31m in Magic City’s case over 15 years to the Little Haiti Revitalization Trust, largely for new “green” affordable housing. The University of Miami’s housing solutions lab has a $300,000 grant from JPMorgan to report on the impact of rising seas to South Florida’s affordable housing stocks and recommend modifications to prevent it from flooding and other climate events. A collaboration of not-for-profit groups is chasing $75m in corporate funding for affordable housing along the 70-mile south Florida rail trail from Miami to West Palm Beach, with the first stage, a $5m project under way to identify, build and renovate 300 units. The threat: Florida has long been plagued by political leadership more in thrall to the interests of big industry than the environment. As governor from 2011 to 2019, Rick Scott, now a US senator, slashed $700m from Florida’s water management budget, rolled back environmental regulations and enforcement, gave a free ride to polluters, and flip-flopped over expanding offshore oil drilling. The politician who came to be known as “Red Tide Rick”, for his perceived inaction over 2018’s toxic algae bloom outbreaks, reportedly banned the words “climate change” and “global warming” from state documents. Possible solutions: It’s too soon for deep deliberations on Scott’s successor, fellow Republican Ron DeSantis, but in little more than a year in office he has made several moves that surprised environmentalists. He appointed Florida’s first chief science officer, created an algae taskforce, struck a deal to prevent drilling in parts of the Everglades, and won a tussle with Florida’s legislature to expand an ambitious land acquisition and preservation program. Last month, state legislators approved the first dedicated climate bill. It appears a promising start for a new administration, but activists say more needs to be done. In January, the Sierra Club awarded DeSantis failing grades in an environmental report card, saying he failed to protect Florida’s springs and rivers and approved new roads that threatened protected wildlife. The cost: Florida’s spending on the environment is increasing. The state budget passed last month included $650m for Everglades restoration and water management projects (an instalment of DeSantis’s $2.5bn four-year pledge) and $100m for Florida Forever. A $100m bridge project jointly funded by the state and federal governments will allow the free flow of water under the Tamiami Trail for the first time in decades. Florida has woken up to the threat of climate change but it is not yet clear how effective the response will be. The challenges are innumerable, the costs immense and the political will to fix or minimize the issues remains questionable, despite recent progress. At stake is the very future of one of the largest and most diverse states in the nation, in terms of both its population and its environment. Action taken now will determine its survival.

"Wildlife species will die out and natural ecosystems collapse in the near future if the climate crisis goes unchecked, scientists have warned, as new research shows that the natural world is at far greater risk from climate breakdown than previously thought. Catastrophe could strike this decade for some species, as key temperature thresholds are crossed. Instead of the anticipated gradual decline of species, there are likely to be a series of sudden collapses.  Ocean ecosystems will be first hit, as the seas have already warmed to an unprecedented extent, and problems such as lack of oxygen and an increase in acid worsen. By the 2040s, a similarly abrupt collapse is likely to spread to the land, causing devastation among key species in Indonesia, the Amazon, India, northern Australia and sub-Saharan Africa and the Congo rainforest. “It’s not a slippery slope, but a series of cliff edges, hitting different places at different times,” said Alex Pigot of University College London, lead author of the study, published today in the journal Nature. What appears to happen, according to the study’s authors, is that most species can cope with warming temperatures for a while. But when a certain temperature threshold is crossed, suddenly a large proportion of species face conditions they have not experienced before, and the ecosystem can abruptly collapse. The authors base their projections on dividing the globe into square cells of 100km by 100km, and within those cells studying the geographic ranges of more than 30,000 species of birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and other animals and plants. They mapped this data against our knowledge of the climate from 1850 to 2005. Then they broke down climate predictions from now until 2100 on an annual basis, examining when the species in each grid cell were likely to experience temperatures higher than they had before. That showed a different picture than had been previously possible, by giving a slow-motion projection, a bit like a time-lapse photograph, at a very fine scale, of how species would react each year as their habitats warmed. Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https://audio.guim.co.uk/2020/05/05-61553-gnl.fw.200505.jf.ch7DW.mp3 “Despite many hundreds of studies looking at the impacts on biodiversity of climate change, this abrupt pattern [of collapse] hasn’t previously been detected, because most studies have focused on projections for one – or a few – snapshots of the future, say the year 2070 or 2100,” Pigot explained. “In our study, we instead quantified how the risks to biodiversity from climate change will change over time at annual resolutions.” The scientists found that, on average, 73% of the species facing unprecedented temperatures before 2100 will cross that threshold simultaneously. If global temperatures rise by 4C above pre-industrial levels by 2100, as they will if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, then at least 15% of ecosystems will have an “abrupt exposure event”, meaning more than one fifth of their constituent species will cross the threshold in the same decade, causing irreversible damage. But at less than 2C of warming, the limit set under the Paris agreement, only 2% of ecosystems will go through such abrupt change, sparing many of the species at risk from higher temperatures. That means taking urgent action on emissions could save tens of thousands of species by “flattening the curve” of the impact, and providing more time for species and ecosystems to adapt. “It is not too late to stop extinctions from climate change,” said Christopher Trisos, of the University of Cape Town, co-author of the three-year study. “Our research shows that rapid action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions this decade will effectively flatten the curve of species at risk. Similar to the Covid-19 pandemic, early action to limit the risk pays off in a big way. It does not eliminate all risk from climate change, but reduces the number of species and ecosystems exposed by a massive amount.” Scientists have known for years about the likely existence of “tipping points” in the world’s climate, when global heating triggers abrupt or self-reinforcing changes: for instance, the melting of the Arctic ice cap uncovers dark sea beneath, which absorbs more heat than the reflective ice and, in turn, results in more melting. This new paper is one of a growing body of research showing there could be similar tipping points in the natural world, related to climate breakdown. It adds to other studies that have shown the Amazon and other major rainforests are likely to turn from carbon sinks to carbon sources, and shown the extent to which the sea and land have already absorbed the impacts of global heating. Mark Wright, director of science at WWF-UK, said: “There is already more than enough evidence that climate change is impacting the natural world and that we risk losing up to a million species. We know what the solutions are to halt climate change and biodiversity loss. “The world is currently rightly focused on tackling the global health emergency. However, this new research reinforces that, after we are through this extremely difficult time, we will need renewed ambitious action to address the climate and nature crisis.”"

 _Global Science Report_ _is a weekly feature from the_ _Center for the Study of Science_ _, where we highlight one or two important new items in the scientific literature or the popular media. For broader and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly “Current Wisdom.”_   
  
Is it hot enough for you?   
  
You don’t know, and neither do global warming policy wonks.   
  
Climatologically speaking, temperatures peak in the second half of July, especially here in the East. Thanks to this, global warming horror stories also max out, followed by the usual pleadings for this or that regulation of dreaded carbon dioxide. The latest greatest rage in a direct tax on carbon dioxide emissions, which will no doubt be trotted out in this week’s eastern heat.   
  
But how hot is it? We know what the thermometer reads, but how does that compare to past thermometer readings?   
  
It turns out there are several factors that confound temperature histories—some obvious, some subtle, and no doubt an unknown number of things that are simply missed.   
  
An obvious one is that bricks, buildings and pavement increasingly “urbanize” the climate, retaining the heat built up during the day and impeding cross ventilation from the local wind regime. To compensate, most long-term temperature histories adjust urban temperatures in comparison to neighboring stations.   
  
A more subtle one is that a systematic change in the time of day in which the high and low temperatures are read (and reset) is also important. As an example, consider a station in which the observer records the previous 24-hour high and low temperatures at 5pm, local time. That’s near the time of day, in the summer, when temperatures are around their daily high. If the day is really hot, say, 100° or so, the temperature at 5:01 is likely to be the same, meaning there are two very hot days recorded when there may have only been one if temperatures were reset at midnight.   
  
There are plenty of other adjustments made to local temperature histories such as accounting for movement of weather stations, changes to the local environment, and adjustments for technological changes, such as switching from mercury-in-glass to electronic thermometers.   
  
And there are some factors that are completely ignored and unaccounted for, having to do with economic factors. Near-neighbor comparisons aren’t going to do a bit of good if an entire country (say, Chad) is too poor to spend anything maintaining weather stations. The fact is that as they “weather,” unattended stations get darker, which means that the temperature gets hotter.   




More on this later.   
  
Consider the Department of Commerce’s US Historical Climate Network (USHCN) for the lower 48 states.   
  
Here’s the raw data (Figure 1), courtesy of Steve Goddard at Real Science (as opposed to the reliably alarmist site “RealClimate”).   






_Figure 1. Unadjusted temperature history of the United States (figure fromReal Science)._



Accounting for changes in the time of observation induces a slight warming trend of a couple of tenths of a degree per century since 1930—but that’s nowhere near the shocking change that results from additional adjustments (Figure 2):

The magnitude of the post-1950 warming induced by data adjustment is in fact equal to over half of the total warming.   
  
What about the effects that aren’t accounted for? A few years back, Guelph University economist Ross McKitrick and yours truly (PJM) calculated the “non climatic” signal in long term temperature histories. Here’s a map of the difference between temperatures adjusted for those factors and what has been reported (Figure 4).   






_Figure 4. Difference bewteen observed and adjusted trends around the world. Positive values mean the observed trends are greater than the trends adjusted to remove non-climatic influences (figure from McKitrick and Michaels, 2007)._



One thing that jumps out is that U.S. temperature records are pretty devoid of much systematic bias (greenish colors are a change of near zero). Another is that really poor places—like much of Africa and rural South America don’t have a lot of high-quality data (reflected by the large expanses of white). What stations they do have are probably not subject to a lot of upkeep such as being painted or washed, making them systematically hotter than they actually are. Current analysis methods involving a comparison to neighboring stations aren’t going to uncover this bias that appears pervasive over large continental regions.   
  
This is one example of a systematic bias that induces artificial warming. And the reality is that we don’t know—obviously—what other factors we don’t know about!   
  
It is doubtful that people pushing the latest fad, such as a carbon tax, have any clue the degree to which global warming is being manufactured (rightly or wrongly) by systematic adjustments to weather data, or how much it is being exaggerated by still unaccounted biases. In climate, policy wonks are rushing in where they should fear to tread.

Green Hell Blog writes: The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit refused late Friday to stop the EPA’s greenhouse gas rules from going into  effect on January 2, 2011. The litigation over the rules will continue,  but the court will allow them to go into effect pending the outcome of  the litigation.
From WaPo
A U.S. appellate court Friday turned down a request from utilities, oil  refiners and the state of Texas to delay the regulation of greenhouse  gas emissions by the Environmental Protection Agency.

As a result, the EPA and state agencies can begin to insist that  companies use the “best available control technologies” to restrict  emissions of carbon dioxide to obtain air permits.
The companies and Texas had sought a court order blocking the EPA from  moving ahead until the end of a lawsuit challenging the agency’s finding  that greenhouse gas emissions from U.S. power plants and large  industrial facilities endanger the health of Americans.
The companies contend in that lawsuit that the EPA regulations would be too costly.
But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia said that the  companies “have not shown that the harms they allege are ‘certain,’  rather than speculative.”

Excerpt from The Inconvenient Skeptic by John Kehr

The longer I am involved in the global warming debate the more frustrated I am getting with the CRU temperature data.   This is the one of the most commonly cited sources of global temperature data, but the numbers just don’t stay  put.  Each and every month the past monthly temperatures are revised.   Since I enter the data into a spreadsheet each month I am constantly  seeing the shift in the data.  If it was the third significant digit it  wouldn’t bother me (very much), but it is much more than that.

For example, I have two very different values for January of 2010  since September 2010.  Here are the values for January based on the date  I gathered it.
Sep 10th, 2010:  January 2010 anomaly was  0.707 °C
Jan 30th, 2011:  January 2010 anomaly is now 0.675 °C
That is a 5% shift in the value for last January that has taken place  in the past 4 months.  All of the initial months of the year show a  fairly significant shift in temperature.

Monthly Temperature values for global temperature change on a regular basis.
Read the entire post here
=============================================================
Some of this may be related to late reporting of GHCN stations, a problem we’ve also seen with GISS. Both GISS and CRU use GHCN station data which are received via CLIMAT reports. Some countries report better than others, some update quickly, some take weeks or months to report in to NOAA/NCDC who manage GHCN.
The data trickle-in problem can have effects on determining the global temperature and making pronouncements about it. What might be a record month at the time of the announcement may not be a few months later when all of the surface data is in. It might be valuable to go back and look at such claims later to see how much monthly temperature values quoted in news reports of the past have shifted in the present.
More on CLIMAT reports here in the WMO technical manual.
UPDATE: For more on the continually shifting data issue, see this WUWT post from John Goetz on what he sees in the GISS surface temperature record:

I felt I had to write about this. In the midst of Jacinda wanting to virtue signal us all to death by declaring a climate emergency for the whole of New Zealand, we get a glimpse of some of the real problems facing our country… and they are not pretty. Take a look at this:



Families are being forced to endure inhumane conditions while queuing for emergency grants to feed and clothe their families, beneficiary advocates say.  
Parents lined up in the torrential rain for hours this morning outside Manurewa’s Work and Income office to meet with advocates who help them with their claims.  
Without them, they say their desperate pleas for cash are almost always denied. 



The first person was outside the Manurewa office just after 2am today – he said he was there to get a grant to pay for warm clothes for his three children.  
“I need to buy long pants, jumpers, jerseys and that, and then I need to get food, because I stay in a three bedroom house – I pay $610 a week.”  
Toni had travelled from Pukekohe and arrived about 4.30am – she was there to get food and winter essentials for her whanau.  
“I’m working about 20 hours a week on top of the benefit and it’s just not enough.  
“That comes a lot down to the rent market, I’m paying $500 a week for a three-bedroom, which is just one unit with three tiny bedrooms that come off that,” she said. 



Okay… so here you have it. The government that was “bringing kindness back”, who were determined to fix the “nine years of neglect” from the previous government, have people so desperate for additional help that they queue at the Manurewa WINZ office at 2 am in order to get help from a poverty advocate to lodge a claim for additional assistance, because otherwise, they are simply dismissed by staff at the WINZ office.



Let’s not be too unfair on the WINZ staff. They have probably adopted a bunker mentality with the enormous overload of claims that they simply cannot keep up with it all. 



Yes, it is easy to blame poor food choices, alcohol, cigarettes or dope for the lack of money management, but they are all citing the same issue. **They are all paying far too much in rent.**



This is the government that has driven private landlords out of the market in droves; that insists on unnecessary high levels of insulation, forcing landlords to give tenants eviction notices or face a $4000 fine. As a result, private rentals are now few and far between and are now solely the domain of wealthy renters. They have embarked on a programme of social housing, but it will take years before there is any real progress on the number of places available. In the meantime, these people are completely stuck; they have to live somewhere, rents are sky high, and they cannot afford the basics of life. How much do you want to bet that many of these people will end up homeless before too long?



It is clear that New Zealand is not a country to live in if you are not fairly well off these days, but who would have ever expected that with a Labour-led government?



Everyone in the line spoke of the difference it made having advocates from Auckland Action Against Poverty (AAAP) with them when they met with Work and Income staff.  
 **The advocates are at the Manurewa office every Thursday, and are allocated 65 appointments. They are typically handed out to those first in line.**



Even those filthy Nats never did this. Without poverty advocates, these people would not be considered for hardship grants. This is what kindness looks like under Jacinda’s government. It is a disgrace.



Let us assume that most of the residents of the area are on relatively low incomes. $20 an hour for a normal 40-hour week gives you $800, and with Working for Families, you may end up paying no tax at all. But if the rent is $610 per week, as quoted above, that leaves $190 to pay for power, phone, food, travel… it is not hard to see how so many people are really struggling. 



“They’re not neglecting their children they just can’t afford it, but WINZ seems to think if you can’t afford your food you’re neglecting your children,” Ms Paraha said.  
“That’s rubbish. They just can’t afford it – the rent is too high.” 



“We only get this many people because they get turned away so often and they can’t do that when AAAP is here.”  
Ms Paraha challenged Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to come and see the situation herself to get an idea of what they were up against.  
“The government needs to get off their bums and come down and have a look for themselves.   
**“Come see the reality for yourself because it is really, really bad.”**



  
I also issue a challenge to our prime minister. Instead of fluffing around trying to decide whether or not to declare a climate emergency (and we all know you will, because you never saw a virtue signal you didn’t like), do something about housing. You promised you would solve the housing crisis. People believed in you. Now do it.



Nothing will happen, of course. She has to do all the important things, such as visit schools, and put Neve to bed every night. She can’t let being prime minister and running the country get in the way of all that.



This government is a disgrace. They are rapidly turning us into a third world country. Ask the people of Manurewa.

While there’s been thousands of legacy media stories about the very real decline in summer sea-ice extent in the Arctic Ocean, we can’t find _one_ about the statistically significant _increase_ in Antarctic sea ice that has been observed at the same time.   
  
Also, comparisons between forecast temperature trends down there and what’s been observed are also very few and far between. Here’s one published in 2015:   






_Observed (blue) and model-forecast (red) Antarctic sea-ice extent published by Shu et al. (2015) shows a large and growing discrepancy, but for unknown reasons, their illustration ends in 2005._



For those who utilize and trust in the scientific method, forming policy (especially _multi-trillion dollar_ policies!) on the basis of what could or might happen in the future seems imprudent. Sound policy, in contrast, is best formulated when it is based upon repeated and verifiable observations that are consistent with the projections of climate models. As shown above, this does not appear to be the case with the vast ice field that surrounds Antarctica.   
  
According to the most recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), CO2-induced global warming will result in a considerable reduction in sea ice extent in the Southern Hemisphere. Specifically, the report predicts a multi-model average decrease of between 16 and 67 percent in the summer and 8 to 30 percent in the winter by the end of the century (IPCC, 2013). Given the fact that atmospheric CO2 concentrations have increased by 20 percent over the past four decades, evidence of sea ice decline should be evident in the observational data if such model predictions are correct. But are they?   
  
Thanks to a recent paper in the _Journal of Climate_ by Josefino Comiso and colleagues, we now know what’s driving the increase in sea-ice down there. It’s—wait for it—cooling temperatures over the ocean surrounding Antarctica.   




This team of six researchers set out to produce an updated and enhanced dataset of sea ice extent and area for the Southern Hemisphere for the period 1978 to 2015. The key enhancement over prior datasets included an improved cloud masking technique that eliminated anomalously high or low sea ice values, assuring that their work is the most definitive study of Antarctic sea ice trends to date.   
  
The six scientists report the existence of a long-term increasing trend in both sea ice extent and area over the period of study (see figure below), with the former measure increasing by 1.7 percent per decade and the latter by 2.5 percent per decade.   






**_Figure 1._** _Monthly anomalies of Southern Hemisphere sea ice extent (left panel) and area (right panel) derived using the newly enhanced SB2 data (black) of Comiso et al. and the older SBA data (red) prior to the enhancements made by Comiso et al. Trend lines for each data set are also shown and the trend values with statistical errors are provided. Source: Comiso et al. (2017)._



With regard to these observed increases, Comiso _et al_. confirm “the trend in Antarctic sea ice cover is positive,” adding “the trend is even more positive than previously reported because prior to 2015 the sea ice extent was anomalously high for a few years, with the record high recorded in 2014 when the ice extent was more than 20 x 106 km2 for the first time during the satellite era.”   
  
They compared satellite-based estimates of temperature over the ocean/ice and found a very high negative correlation between ice cover and temperature. So, the large and systematic increase in ice extent must be related to a cooling over the sea-ice region throughout the 36-year period of record in this study.   
  
Why is this important? Much like the problems with the missing “tropical hot spot” we noted last month, Antarctic sea-ice modulates a cascade of meteorology. When it’s gone, or in decline, as is the forecast from the climate models, much more of the sun’s energy goes into the ocean, as that energy is only very poorly absorbed by ice, which means an enhanced warming of the Southern Ocean. That has effects on Antarctica itself, where slightly warmed surrounding waters will dramatically increase snowfall on the continent. The fact that there are only glimmerings of this showing up (if at all) should have tipped people off that something was very wrong with the temperature forecast for the nearby ocean.   
  
Consequently, it is clear that despite a 20 percent increase in atmospheric CO2, and model predictions to the contrary, sea ice in the Antarctic has expanded for decades. Such observations are in direct opposition to the model-based predictions of the IPCC.   
  
(N.B. as noted in our May Day post, the Antarctic ice sensor crashed last April, and subsequent data appears to be very unreliable and, in some cases, physically impossible.)

Share this...FacebookTwitterSome big energy developments in Germany lately.
Several readers pointed out an article appearing in the online daily Die Welt here. It seems that Eastern Europe has said “no” to hugely subsidized, unstable German green electricity flowing across the border into their power grids.
One reason is because Germany still has not installed the huge power transmission lines needed to deliver the sometimes massive wind and solar electricity directly to heavy industry in Central and Southern Germany. And it’ll be years before it can, if ever. Therefore Germany reroutes its intermittently massive amounts of wind and solar energy through the power grids of its Eastern European neighbors (mainly Poland and the Czech Republic) and then to its industry to the south.
The problem with this rerouting is that Poland and the Czech Republic now often find their power grids critically and unpredictably overloaded, and thus have decided to install equipment to keep German electricity out when certain levels are reached.
Die Welt writes:
Polish grid operator PSE has agreed to build together with grid operator 50 Hertz so-called phase shifters, with which excessive current flows can be blocked. Their use is planned to be ‘very soon’.”
So what happens if all the windparks and solar farms in Northeastern Germany cannot deliver their power to the industry ín the south via Poland? Stephan Kohler, Chief of semi-state-owned German Energy Agency (Dena) says.
The use of phase shifters will have the consequence that windparks in Eastern Germany will have to be shut down more often in the future because the power will have no way of being delivered to the markets.”
So the windpark operators in Eastern Germany will be getting the shaft, right? Wrong!
Germany’s Feed-In Act stipulates that windparks get paid whether or not their power gets bought. The costs for the electricity that never gets bought is simply gets passed on to the poor consumers.
Such is the world of the government centrally-controlled energy market. Is it any wonder that in just a few short years Germany’s electricity prices have risen to levels that are among the highest in the world?
Germans becoming fed up with green costs

Meanwhile Die Welt reports today that German consumers are fed up with the high prices of electricity, and are now loudly demanding a course correction with renewable energy.
The solutions to the problem now being proposed, however, are almost as lunatic as the idea of trying to power the country with renewable energy in the first place. Germany’s communist PDS party for example is calling for giving consumers incentives to purchase new, energy-efficient appliances. You see, consumers can solve their problem of not having enough money by simply forking out lots of money for new white goods. Make sense?
Another brilliant solution proposed by Greens and leftists is to force industry to pay more for electricity, and thus allow lower rates for little consumers. Of course the masterminds behind that idea still have not thought about what industry will do with the higher prices they’ll have to pay for their power. You don’t suppose they’d get the idea to pass the extra costs along to the consumers, do you?
Clearly we see in Europe that there is a creativity contest to see who can come up with the most lunatic ideas to keep the subsidized renewable scam going.
Amazingly, there are a couple of politicians who recognize the root of the problem, like CSU politician Gerda Hasselfeldt, who says “the SPD socialists and Greens are responsible for the rapidly rising energy prices. We have to try to control the transformation to renewable energy, and not do what Red-Green did: promote an uncontrolled expansion of renewable energy,” she said.
Well, at least she’s on the right track. The solution of course is to do away with the senseless, destructive subsidies altogether.
German coal will be around longer than you think
EU Energy Commissar Günther Oettinger told Die Welt that coal will have to continue playing a major role in Germany’s energy supply and to do so for “a lot longer than what some are prepared to accept.”
Wind turbine lifeime is only 10 – 15 years!
Finally, there’s another bit of bad news  indicating that wind power is going to cost consumers a lot more. The Renewable Energy Foundation has published a new study, The Performance of Wind Farms in the United Kingdom and Denmark, showing that the economic life of onshore wind turbines is between 10 and 15 years, not the 20 to 25 years projected by the wind industry itself, and used for government projections. Read more here.
Tough times ahead for the renewable energy pipe-dream.

NCEP NAM/WRF 4-km rainfall forecast (next 60-hours)
For those in SE Texas hoping for some drough relief from Tropical Storm Don, so far early Saturday morning after landfall, a trace or scant rainfall is to be found.  Don’s convection has distintigrated with only a weak-low level swirl evident on radar.  Hopefully as daytime heating occurs on Saturday and Sunday, a thunderstorm can pop up.
The NCEP 4-km NAM/WRF simulated radar forecast shows the circulation progressing across Texas Rio Grande during the next 24-36 hours before merging with the North American monsoon. However, rainfall forecast for the next 2.5 days shows a lot of white nothing across most of the drought-stricken state.

“Out of passions grow opinions; mental sloth lets these rigidify into convictions”
Friedrich Nietzsche, 1844-1900

Anthony discussed the press release about the paper Past and ongoing shifts in Joshua tree distribution support future modeled range contraction. I didn’t have a copy so I wrote to the lead author, Kenneth Cole, to request one. He responded immediately and sent me a copy. My thanks to him, that’s science at its best. Other than the ritual obeisance to the climate models, the paper tells an interesting story about Joshua trees and the extinct Shasta ground sloths.
IMAGE SOURCE
The Joshua “tree” is a cactus not a tree, it’s one one of the famous Yucca tribe of cacti spiny spiky things that aren’t cacti according to folks who know better than I do. Calling it a tree is merely the other cactus’s Yucca’s polite way to try to make it feel better about its funny appearance and desolate condition. It grows where almost nobody else can grow, in a very restricted climate range in the American Southwest. Not too hot, not too cold, not too much rain or too little rain, just right.

The fruit of the Joshua tree is a seed pod that was a favorite food of the Shasta ground sloth. The sloth appears to have been the only major seed dispersal mechanism for the Joshua tree. Which is hardly surprising, since other than pack rats and ground sloths, there’ve never been many herbivores hanging out where the Joshua tree grows. It’s way dry in that corner of the US.
The black stars in Figure 2 (from their paper) show the current location of Joshua trees, in and around the Mojave Desert in the hot Southwest.
Figure 2. The authors used rainfall and temperature maps to determine where Joshua trees might possibly grow, with green showing the most favorable climates. Map shows the lower parts of California (left) and Nevada (upper middle), along with a section of western Arizona.ORIGINAL CAPTION: … (A) Suitable climate model for Joshua tree created with mid 20th century (AD 1930 1969) PRISM mean precipitation variables and extreme mean monthly temperature events.
Now, to start with their map is interesting. I mean, the Joshua trees are certainly not growing extensively in what is the best part of the their range according to the authors. Unfortunately, much of the area they say is best for Joshua trees is on Nellis Air Force Base, so there’s no information for large areas. On the other hand, some areas with orange or even red (low probability) have a number of Joshua trees. However, nature is never as neat as we’d like it to be, and they’ve done well to generally outline the range by climate variables. And if it becomes desirable to plant Joshua trees, we know where they’ll likely grow.
Fifteen thousand years ago, in the days of the now-extinct Shasta ground sloth, the geological evidence from pack rat middens and sloth dung shows that the Joshua tree was much more widespread. However, humans happened upon the North American scene around that time, and converted all of the ground sloths into ground slothburgers and barbecued them. Which was bad news for the Joshua trees (not to mention the sloths), because no one else had much taste for Joshua tree seeds. As a result, the range of the Joshua tree is much reduced from its former glory.
The authors also show that the current range of the Joshua trees is further north, and at a higher elevation, than in the times of the ground sloth. During the last ice age the range of the Joshua tree extended across other areas that are now too hot or otherwise unsuitable to support them. As it warmed at the end of the ice age, the Joshua trees retreated (and advanced) to their current locations.
The problem is that without the ground sloths, the Joshua tree’s only seed dispersal mechanism is pack rats. The authors estimated the rate of spread from packrats at two metres per year. This seemed low to me, but is explained in the paper. The missing parts of the puzzle were a) unlike sloths, the packrats only carry the seeds a maximum of about forty metres or so to their homes, and b) the trees take twenty years to reach maturity and produce seeds. Result … 2 metres per year rate of spread. Always more to learn.
So far, so good. And if they’d quit there, it would have been an interesting paper. But no, they had to bring in the climate models. Now, climate models are notoriously bad at predicting precipitation (rain and snowfall). So they figured they’d pick the best of the bunch, viz:
Future downscaled GCM projections
To assess potential future changes in Joshua tree’s suitable climate space we compared future projections from several GCM’s for the late 21st century (2070 2099; ~2X CO2). Five individual models and one ensemble of 48 runs of 22 models based upon the A1B carbon emission scenario were obtained from the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI; AR4) archive (available online). The five individual models used were: Hadley Center for Climate predic tion (Hadgem1), Max Planck Institute for Meteor ology (Mpi_echam5), CSIRO Atmospheric Research (Csiro_mk3), National Center for Atmospheric Research (Ncar_ccsm3), and Centre National de Recherches Météorologiques (Cnrm_cm3). They were selected because they represent a wide range of future moisture availability conditions for southwestern North America (Seager et al. 2007), and they all were ranked within the top half (of 22 models tested) for their ability to hindcast 20th century precipitation seasonality within the southwestern U.S. deserts (Garfin et al. 2010). These models, especially the Hadgem1 and Mpi_echam5, outperformed most models in replicating the 1950 to 1999 AD geographic distribution of average seasonal precipitation (Garfin et al. 2010).
Then, once they had what they figured were the best five models giving a “wide range” of rainfall results, they ran them and tried to figure where the Joshua trees might live in the future. The models gave differing results, so the authors defined a threshold for suitability (18%). If three of the five models said a particular gridcell would be above the 18% suitablity threshold for Joshua trees, they called it an “area of agreement for future suitable climate (AAFSC)”.
Then they show what those 5 models (and the 22 model ensemble) said would be suitable areas for Joshua trees in the years 2070-2099. Which all sounds vaguely reasonable until we look at their results in Figure 3 …
Figure 3. Results for five models (B-F) and 22 model ensemble (G). Pink areas with thin black outline show current range of the Joshua trees. ORIGINAL CAPTION: … (B G) The Joshua tree future suitable climate model runs for late 21st century (AD 2070 2099 AD): (B) Hadgem1, (C) Mpi_echam5, (D) Csiro_mk3, (E) Ncar_ccsm3, (F) Cnrm_cm3, and (G) Ensemble (44 runs of 22 GCMs).
See, if those results were mine, I’d throw up my hands and say “Not ready for prime time”. Those models are all over the map. They said they picked the models to “represent a wide range of future moisture availability conditions”, but I wasn’t expecting that huge a range. One model is “everything’s fine”, another is “they’re all gonna die!” That’s so wide as to be useless, and these are among the best models.
I don’t see any way that an average of those, or an “AAFSC” of those (area of agreement for future suitable climate), has any meaning at all. One of the models shows a wide area of hundreds of thousands of hectares where the Joshua tree could live, and another shows no suitable area at all.
Finally, once again we have the problem I have called “Models all the way down“. While the model results are interesting, they’ve skipped a big step. I want to see a map, just like the maps above showing possible future distributions of Joshua trees. But I want one showing how well the individual models (and the 22 model ensemble) did at hindcasting the current distribution of the Joshua trees.
I mean seriously – before showing us the model forecasts for 2070-2099 Joshua tree distributions, shouldn’t they show us the model hindcasts for the 1970-1999 Joshua tree distributions? It wouldn’t rescue the paper, but at least it might give some reason to think the selected models might be better than throwing darts at a map of the Mojave region.
Because without that, it’s just models disagreeing and quarreling with each other, all the way down …

Share this...FacebookTwitterAnd if they can’t put the wind turbines up on ridgelines, there aren’t too many other places they could be put in Vermont. I guess developers could try putting them “offshore” on Lake Champlain – yeah, right. That would be as stupid as putting them on mountain ridgelines.

Lukas Snelling brings a bit of good news about the public mood regarding wind turbines in the state at Energize Vermont. Normally, I write about news in Germany, but I hope readers will forgive me for sometimes meandering off to Vermont, my native state.
Vermonters are beginning to sober up. Perhaps some of that fine Scotch has finally made its way to the Green Mountains and instilled a little sanity in the Yankee culture after all.
The latest numbers released today from the Castleton Polling Institute show support for ridgeline wind in Vermont continues to erode. Support for wind on Vermont’s ridgelines reached a high of 74% in favor in Vermont’s deliberative polling back in 2008 to only 66% of Vermonter’s declaring their support for ridgeline wind today.
“Poll questions are overly simplistic and theoretical. Asking people if they like something without explaining the pros or cons doesn’t really give you a meaningful result. Polls with a low sample size and a high margin of error poll are not reliable gauges of the status of the issue across the state,” said Lukas Snelling, Executive Director of Energize Vermont. “However, from these polls a clear trend has emerged. The more Vermonters know about these projects and their impacts, the fewer people support them.”

In 12 town votes from the last decade over 58% of voters have opposed the projects in their communities, with only 41% supporting them. The most recent votes in Hubbardton and Brighton were even stronger against with 94% opposed in Hubbardton and 62% opposed in Brighton. Additionally, Select Boards of the four Rutland County towns around the proposed Grandpa’s Knob project recently voted to oppose utility-scale wind in their communities. Three of the four town boards did so unanimously.
“Citizens investigating this technology’s impact on their communities are deciding wind projects don’t make for good neighbors. With four projects operating in Vermont and accumulating noise complaints, and another three communities with active developments, Vermonters are examining this technology more than they ever have before. We predict support will continue to erode as developers continue to push this technology on our communities,” continued Snelling.
“Vermonters are seeing that ridgeline wind in Vermont is less about the environment and more about generating revenue for the developers. We see interest in smaller-scale solutions and solar technologies growing everyday. We are actively building a renewable energy future for Vermont that is firmly within our legacy of environmental protection,” concluded Snelling.
The coming months will bring another benchmark of public opinion in the wind debate. Like last year, this year’s Town Meeting Day Doyle Poll will ask for Vermonter’s opinions on ridgeline wind in the State. Although unscientific, comparing this year’s results to last years will give another barometer of the trend. Last year 64% of respondents support wind turbine construction on our ridgelines statewide, with lower numbers in communities where projects were operating or proposed.
Energize Vermont was created to educate and advocate for establishing renewable energy solutions that are in harmony with the irreplaceable character of Vermont, and that contribute to the well-being of all her people. This mission is achieved by researching, collecting, and analyzing information from all sources; and disseminating it to the public, community leaders, legislators, media, and regulators for the purpose of ensuring informed decisions for long-term stewardship of our communities.
Sanity is returning (though there’s still a way to go, i.e. solar). Time for a toast with a little Bruichladdich.

There is much wailing and gnashing of teeth lately about the declining Arctic Ocean ice. Pierre and I have written several articles discussing the roll of soot and dust assisting melt of both the sea ice and the land ice on Greenland and other locations around the world. See here, here, and here.
But the warmists have always pointed to CO2 and “Global Warming/Climate Change” as the culprit behind the decline in Arctic ice. But proof has been lacking.
The major source of northern hemisphere soot and dust is Asia, chiefly China. They currently use over 3 billion tons of coal annually, and this amount has been steadily increasing with but one hesitation in the mid-1990’s. The question then becomes: What are the relationships between temperature and ice decline, and China’s use of coal and ice decline? The figures used were from Wikipedia for the annual coal production, and WoodForTrees for the annual average UAH satellite temperature and NSIDC NH ice index. The time period examined is the 30-year satellite era from 1980 to 2010.

It is clear from the charts that coal use in China is the primary culprit in the loss of Arctic Sea ice, especially in the last ten years. The R-Squared value, the goodness of fit, is almost twice that for global temperature. An R-squared value of one would mean a perfect fit… that is, the data all lines up on the trend line.
As long as China continues to burn vast quantities of coal with few attempts to clean up their particulate emissions, their unintended effort to melt the Arctic will continue.

"Up to a million species are at risk of extinction according to a new report on biodiversity. But even some species that aren’t considered endangered may be less safe than people think. A new study published in the Journal of Applied Ecology found that some methods for measuring a species’ generation time might underestimate the likelihood that some species will die out. A species’ generation time is how long it takes for a generation to be replaced by its mature offspring. This is different for every species and dramatically impacts how quickly a species can respond to changes in their environment. If based on incomplete data or the wrong method, this can seriously distort how we assess the risk of extinction to a given species. The generation time of a mouse is only a few months, whereas the African elephant has a generation time of 22 years. The longer the generation time, the slower a species can adapt to environmental changes and may, therefore, be more likely to go extinct. The rate at which species are dying out today is at least 100 times as high as it should naturally be. As extinction rates accelerate, the tools used to measure the risk to different species need improving to give conservationists an accurate picture. That begins by replacing traditional assumptions with better tools. The challenge of accurately assessing extinction risk begins with a lack of data on endangered species. Even for mammals and birds – which are the most well studied groups – population data covers a mere 4.4% of the 1,079 threatened mammals and 3.5% of the 1,183 threatened birds. To bridge the gaps, scientists often rely on assumptions regarding survival, reproduction and generation time. We found that in some risk assessment models that rely on these assumptions, errors can emerge. This is because population reduction in some of the assessed models is measured on the scale of three times a species’ generation time. If a species is believed to mature and produce offspring in five years, then how much its population has declined will be measured over a 15-year interval.  But if a species’ generation time is underestimated, population reduction is measured over a much shorter time period. It therefore underestimates how much the population is shrinking and, in turn, the threat status of the species. This can lead us to believe that the species is less endangered than it really is. We tested the influence of errors in different measures of generation time, including those used by the IUCN Red List assessments – the world authority on the conservation status of species – and found that these errors could potentially lead to an overly optimistic assessment of extinction risk for some species. To overcome this, we compared different types of errors in seven commonly used measures of generation time. By having a clear picture of the types of errors that impact the estimation of generation time, conservationists can better account for these factors in extinction risk assessments when data is scarce.  When scientists don’t have data on survival and fertility for a species, we propose a new estimate which would avoid relying on unfounded assumptions. This predicts a species’ generation time from its body mass and reproductive lifespan – data which is usually more readily available for many species. Still, the lack of data is a thorny problem for making accurate calculations. We’re planning to explore how to fill some of these knowledge gaps by comparing survival and reproduction data from wild and captive populations, using data curated by nearly 1,200 zoos and aquariums over 40 years, on more than 21,000 species."

"**A woman has become blind after her monthly eye injections were delayed for four months during lockdown.**
Helen Jeremy, 73, said everything she enjoyed doing has ""gone out of the window"" after losing her eyesight.
Thousands more people in Wales are at risk of ""irreversible sight loss"" because of treatment delays, RNIB Cymru warns.
The Welsh Government said health boards are working to increase services.
Mrs Jeremy, from Bridgend, has glaucoma and was diagnosed with age-related macular degeneration four years ago.
Monthly injections controlled the condition and meant she could still drive and play the piano.
However, her appointments were cancelled when the pandemic struck and her eyesight deteriorated.
""I was panicking. It was terrifying. Because I'm a widow I'm on my own and it was awful,"" she said.
""Suddenly my eyesight was basically gone. By the time of my next appointment I was told there was no point in going on with these injections because the damage had been done to the back of my eye.
""Everything I loved doing has gone out of the window and my life's changed totally.""
Cardiff and Vale University Health Board said priority at the time was based on patient risk.
""We are sorry that Mrs Jeremy sadly experienced deterioration in her eyesight a few weeks following her last treatment in July,"" a spokesperson said.
""Sadly, some eye conditions can become worse over time despite ongoing treatment.""
However, a Freedom of Information request by BBC Wales to all health boards in Wales found more than 33,000 people at risk of sight loss were waiting too long for treatment.
Health boards are expected to meet the target to see 95% of the most serious cases on time.
The average was 66% for all health boards in March - and that figure fell to just 53% in October.
The number of people waiting more than nine months for cataract surgery has also quadrupled in the last year, from 1,096 in October last year to 5,693 this October.
Consultant ophthalmologist Gwyn Williams, who specialises in cataract surgery at Singleton Hospital, said the number of people waiting had ""ballooned almost exponentially"".
""It is simply impossible to bring forward the appointment of everybody that asks because our capacity has been cut so severely,"" he said.
""There is a visual price being by the people of our country for the coronavirus restrictions in the name of a greater good of controlling the spread of this virus.""
RNIB Cymru described the delays are ""extremely worrying"" and said it has helped other people who believe they have lost vision because of cancelled appointment during the coronavirus pandemic.
Director Ansley Workman said that while she recognises the impact of Covid on the NHS, ""that doesn't take away from the fact that there are thousands of people in Wales who are at risk of irreversible sight loss"".
She called on the Welsh Government to commit to putting in the ""investment and resources to make sure that people are seen in a timely manner and that sight is saved.""
""Before Covid came along there were already people waiting far too long for the treatment they needed to make sure they didn't lose their sight unnecessarily,"" she added.
The Welsh Government said optometric practices and hospital eye care departments across Wales have been open for essential and urgent eye care during the pandemic.
""As with all planned care specialities, ophthalmology has been impacted by the pandemic and performance has been effected,"" a spokesperson said.
""Health Boards are working to increase ophthalmology activities and are prioritising patients based on clinical risk.
""They are doing all they can to keep Covid and non-Covid patients separate and have been changing the care environment with the creation of 'green zones'."""

Since I did not attend Lisbon even though invited and initially accepted, (other business and family obligations took precedence) the very least I can do is to help elevate the discussion. Here’s a report from Dr. Judith Curry, and I urge WUWT readers to read it in it’s entirety.  Hopefully Mosh will weigh in here with his report once he’s recovered from the trip. I’m sure Steve McIntyre will be posting on the conference also. Since this is a new topic, and one bound to be widely discussed, I’ve added a “climate reconciliation” category to WUWT. I’ll have some thoughts later. – Anthony
Lisbon Workshop on Reconciliation: Part II 
by Judith Curry (excerpts from her blog)
Here are some reactions from the Lisbon Workshop on Reconciliation in  the Climate Debate.  These are my personal reflections, and include  some of the perspectives and statements made by others (without any  attribution of names).

The first issue is what exactly is meant by reconciliation, and who  actually wants it?  Reconciliation is defined (wikipedia) as  re-establishing normal relations between belligerents: re-establish  dialogue, reinstate balance,  restore civility.  It is not clear that  there has ever been normal relations between, say, the mainstream IPCC  researchers and  the skeptical climate blogosphere. Consensus building  was not seen as having any part in a reconciliation.  Rather there was a  desire to conduct impassioned debates nonviolently, and to create an  arena where we can fight a more honest fight over the science and the  policy options.
So who actually wants some sort of reconciliation or an increase in  civility?  One perspective was that the alarmists shooting at the  deniers, and deniers shooting at the alarmists, with a big group in the  middle, with both the deniers and the alarmists ruining the situation  for reasoned debate about the science and the policy options.  Another  perspective described the fight as entertaining theater.  One  perspective was that there is no incentive for conciliation by either  side; both sides like the “war.”  In the context of the “war,” the hope  was expressed that more moderate voices would emerge in the public  debate.
The issue of civility and nonviolence in communication was regarded  as an important topic by the Workshop organizers.  They brought in an  expert to facilitate nonviolent communication.  This frankly didn’t go  over very well with the Workshop participants, for a variety of  reasons.  This particular group of participants wasn’t very volatile in  terms of emotions running high, use of offensive language, or heated  arguments.  The main format of the Workshop was for groups of 7-8 to  discuss various controversial topics.  Each group had a different  dynamic; the group I was in had some colorful personalities but not  terribly impassioned positions on the alarmist-denier spectrum.  One  table did encompass the entire spectrum, but the dynamic of that group  seemed collegial.  So the issue of getting skeptics to sit down with  alarmists (these were the two words that were generally used to describe  the two poles of the debate) and talk politely and constructively  didn’t turn out to be a problem.  This is partly a function of the  individuals invited, who for the most part weren’t too far out there on  either extreme and expressed their willingness to communicate by  actually agreeing to attend the Workshop.
…
Towards reconciliation
Some principles/strategies that were discussed to improving the scientific debate:

Acknowledge      that there are real issues and we don’t agree on how to resolve them
Disagreement      with mutual respect
Find      better ways to communicate criticism
Find      better ways to admit mistakes without damage to reputation
Find      some common ground, something to work on together
Find      where interests intersect
Importance of transparency
Communication      engenders trust
Search      for win-win solutions (i.e. both sides work to increase the funding base      to collect more paleoproxies).

From the University of Tennessee at Knoxville
Solar industry responsible for lead emissions in developing countries
Solar power is not all sunshine. It has a dark side—particularly in developing countries, according to a new study by a University of Tennessee, Knoxville, engineering professor.
A study by Chris Cherry, assistant professor in civil and environmental engineering, found that solar power heavily reliant on lead batteries has the potential to release more than 2.4 million tons of lead pollution in China and India.
Lead poisoning causes numerous adverse health effects, including damage to the central nervous system, the kidneys, the cardiovascular system, and the reproductive system. In children, blood lead concentration is associated with learning impairments, as well as hyperactive and violent behavior.
His study, co-authored with Perry Gottesfeld of Occupational Knowledge International (OK International), appears in the September issue of the journal Energy Policy.

Lead pollution predicted to result from investments in solar power by 2022 is equivalent to one-third of current global lead production. The researchers, who relied on official government plans for deploying solar power to make these projections, also found that the countries have large amounts of lead leak into the environment from mining, smelting, battery manufacturing, and recycling—33 percent in China and 22 percent in India. Also, a large percentage of new solar power systems continues to be reliant on lead batteries for energy storage due to the inadequate power grid in these countries.
The study’s release comes on the heels of reports of a large number of mass lead poisoning incidents around lead battery recycling and manufacturing plants in China and the announcement that the country recently closed 583 of these facilities.
“Investments in environmental controls in the lead battery industry, along with improvements in battery take-back policies, are needed to complement deployment of solar power in these countries,” said Cherry. “Without improvements, it is increasingly clear that the use of lead batteries will contribute to environmental contamination and lead poisoning among workers and children.”
The battery industry is the largest consumer of lead, using approximately 80 percent of global lead production. Lead battery manufacturing is growing rapidly in much of the world to meet demand for batteries for solar power and other applications. With the authors’ projected emissions, they say this will impact public health and contribute to environmental contamination.
“The solar industry has to step up and take responsibility for ensuring that their lead battery suppliers are operating with adequate controls as long as they are going to be reliant on this technology,” said Gottesfeld. “Without major improvements in the manufacturing and recycling lead batteries in these countries, we expect that lead poisoning will increase as the industry grows.”
The projections outlined in the study, while based on plans articulated by these two countries, are likely to be repeated throughout much of the developing world, such as in Africa.

End the use of ‘fossil’ fuels to solve the climate emergency! No worries, we can do that. Just need to build a few alternatives. Like:



Since we can promise to build 100,000 homes in 10 years, this will be easy for us. Zero Carbon here we come. ‘Fossil’ fuels are dead! Ye ha!



Or not! Here is some analysis from the Financial Post. ( _Canadian centric_ )



Judging from the headlines, Canada and the world are on track to ratchet up renewable energy and begin the rapid scale-down and ultimate phase-out of fossil fuels. **Most energy analysts consider the fossil-fuel phase-out to be a scientific, economic and political fantasy, akin to levitation and time travel,** but the movement keeps making news.



Governments everywhere — from Canada to the United Kingdom to states in Australia — are declaring climate emergencies and committing to variations on zero emissions. The international organization promoting emergency declarations claims “a fast transition to zero emissions is possible.”



Canada’s Green Party, said to be gaining ground, has a new platform plan, headlined “Mission: Possible,” to eliminate fossil fuels by 2050. A proposed Green New Deal in America aims to eliminate fossil fuels from the U.S. power grid by 2030 and phase gasoline out of the transportation sector.[…]



So what are the carbon zeroists talking about? Aside from massive amounts of government intervention — **almost a total takeover of the economy** — the practicality of it all looks a bit impossible, to put it mildly. As the graph below suggests, the required technological and economic change could be a little overwhelming.



The general scale of the operation is hinted at by Climate Mobilization, an organization promoting climate emergency declarations: “Only WWII-scale Climate Mobilization can protect humanity and the natural world.”[…]



To produce the electric power needed to offset the lost fossil fuel energy, **Canada would have to build 2.5 hydro power dams the size of British Columbia’s $13-billion Site C project somewhere in the country “every year for the foreseeable future”** leading up to the proposed 2050 carbon reduction targets. The geographic and cost obstacles send that prospect into the realm of the impossible.



On a global basis, **the magnitude of the implied decarbonization effort illustrated in the graph takes us beyond the possible and into the world of junk science fiction.** In 2018, world consumption of fossil fuels rose to 11,865 million tonnes of oil equivalent (mtoe). To get that down to near zero by 2050 as proposed by the zeroists would require a lot of alternative energy sources.



University of Colorado scientist Roger Pielke Jr. did some of the rough numbers. “There are 11,161 days until 2050. Getting to net zero by 2050 requires replacing one mtoe of fossil fuel consumption every day starting now.” On a global basis, such a transition would require building the equivalent of one new 1.5-gigawatt nuclear plant every day for the next 30 years. […]



  
 **Don’t like nuclear?** Okay, let’s go solar. According to a U.S. government site, it takes about three million solar panels to produce one gigawatt of energy. (When the sun shines.) We need 1.5gW per day, which means 4.5 million solar panels installed every day until 2050. That’s only about 50 billion panels, the Chinese can make them, no sweat.



 **Or perhaps wind?** This only requires about 430 new wind turbines each of the 11,161 days leading to 2050. (And just the right amount of wind.) What another 4.8 million bird chompers will do to the extinction rate is unstated.



So long as the Chinese don’t start getting precious about the supply of rare earth metals that are needed to make wind turbine generator magnets we should be fine. 



Yup, it seems that James and Megan have it all sorted. Easy as!



Or as Darryl would say …

The Environmental Protection Agency has just announced that it will not meet a Sept. 30 deadline to issue new rules limiting emissions of carbon dioxide from power plants. This comes on the heels of a recent directive by President Barack Obama that the Agency delay issuing standards for ozone that would have shut down many of these plants.



Enviros are mad. So sue the EPA. I think that may be what it wants, and I want it also.



At some point this will happen: Green petitioners will cite the Supreme Court case, _Massachusetts v. EPA_ , which compels the agency to regulate greenhouse gas emissions if it finds, as it did on Dec. 7, 2009, that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases “endanger” human health and welfare. The Court held that the regulatory authority resided in the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments passed in the first Bush Administration.





[O]ur government conducts exceedingly sloppy climate science and gets away with it.



The EPA largely based its finding of endangerment to U.S. citizens upon a document produced by the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP; a federal consortium) called “Global Climate Change Impacts in the United States.” If there’s a lawsuit, this document is going to finally receive the public scrutiny it has long deserved.



The document’s senior writer is Susan J. Hassol, a former HBO producer of climate horror flicks. The co‐​chairs, editors‐​in‐​chief, and team of authors are the who’s who of Big Climate Science. Not one of these had any incentive to produce anything but an alarmist screed.



Which they did. It is very slick and, in important places, blatantly wrong. In fact, it’s really hard to find a single paragraph that isn’t missing some important climate fact or research article that would greatly dilute the message of horror. There are errors so big that one cannot believe that it was peer‐​reviewed, but it most certainly was.



My favorite — and one that will certainly be prominently noted when the greens sue — is on page 58. It is an illustration from which the USGCRP preposterously states that “The number of incidents [power outages] caused by extreme weather has increased tenfold since 1992.” Here:





I’ve seen this everywhere. A Nobel Prize winner (who’s name I have been asked not to reveal), with no real experience in the study of climate change impacts, shows it wherever he can. Lacking critical insight, he finds it compelling and meaningful.



What it really means is that our government conducts exceedingly sloppy climate science and gets away with it. If the figure were true, there were apparently NO power outages caused by temperature extremes, wildfires, winter weather, thunderstorms and lightning in 1992. The fact is that both then and now, even a modestly severe thunderstorm knocks out power in Washington, where most of the authors spend a lot of time. Or how about 1995? No outages were caused by wind, hurricanes, wildfires, or winter weather, even though Category 3 Hurricane Opal hit north Florida (and, in fact, put 2 million in the dark).



A “tenfold” increase in weather‐​caused outages is preposterous. There’s been no change in strong tornado frequency, tropical cyclone activity is near historic lows, and any observed changes in mean or extreme winds are nugatory. Even the UN’s politicized Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change finds “insufficient evidence” for any trend in lightning strikes.



If greens are reluctant to sue the EPA while Obama is president, just wait a few years. If, as many believe (and I have no opinion on this), the nation is headed towards a change of party in both the Senate and the Executive Branch, be certain that there will be legislation to strip the Agency of its power to regulate greenhouse gases.



No can do, will go the lawsuit. After all, _Mass. v. Epa_ holds that, once EPA finds “endangerment” from carbon dioxide and its ilk, then it must regulate, obviously to the point where there is no longer endangerment.



Consequently, the EPA will have to somehow reverse its finding. That means completely disavowing the USGCRP report and its constellation of star authors, unless, of course, a new Congress specifically re‐​writes the Clean Air Act to eliminate any reference to carbon dioxide or greenhouse gases. That’s a tall order. Old hands will remind lawmakers of how many Congressional seats the George W. Bush administration lost when it (correctly) noted that arsenic standards were unrealistic.



The bottom line is that, _whoever_ is in power, there will be big pressure on the EPA to regulate greenhouse gases. But, when the suits are brought, whether now or in another Administration, the outrageous “science” used to find “endangerment” will be revealed for all to see.

Mounting evidence shows that China has enacted wide‐​ranging human rights abuses, including coercive population control, on its Uyghur minority. An Associated Press investigation released in late June showed that while China’s rate of permanent sterilization procedures is falling nationally, the rate in Xinjiang, where many Uyghurs live, has skyrocketed. Many of those surgeries were involuntary. Many Uyghur women are forcibly sterilized after having two children, as third children are illegal in China. The two‐​child policy replaced China’s previous one‐​child policy in 2016.





The immense cruelty of what is happening to China’s Uyghur population demonstrates the inhumanity of China’s two‐​child policy and the urgency of combating the mindset that undergirds it. The way that the policy is enforced is influenced by prejudice against minorities, but authorities justify the policy with neo‐​Malthusianism, defined as the fear that a large population size could lead to a humanitarian and ecological disaster and that combating so‐​called overpopulation is thus an urgent problem. “The tensions between population and resources and environment will not fundamentally change,” noted China’s State Council in its national population development plan for 2016–2030, released in 2017. The plan specifies, according to state‐​run news agency Xinhua, that the government must continue to implement the “two‐​child policy to promote balanced population development.”



Sadly, the view that some groups are less worthy of having children than others has often gone hand in hand with neo‐​Malthusianism, both historically and today. China’s government subjects Uyghurs to strict enforcement of the country’s two‐​child limit, using overpopulation concerns about resource scarcity in part as a cover to make forcibly decreasing the population of a minority more palatable.





The world is doomed, many people argue, citing poverty, dwindling natural resources, and an allegedly unsustainable rate of population growth. They say there are just too many problems to overcome. But is that really the case? Join the conversation and find out.



The neo‐​Malthusian mindset has caused many people outside of China to turn a blind eye to the coercive nature of the one‐​child (now two‐​child) policy. As recently as 2018, New York University law professor Dan Guttman told Harvard Political Review: “With the one‐​child policy, China put into effect the single most effective climate change rule in the world.”



In fact, Western development professionals originally encouraged China’s birth limits. In 1983, the United Nations Population Fund bestowed an award on Qian Xinzhong, head of China’s State Family Planning Commission and the man in charge of the country’s one‐​child policy, as well as Indira Gandhi, India’s prime minister who declared a national “Emergency” that suspended civil liberties and mandated sterilizations on a massive scale between 1975 and 1977.



Fears that without coercion, China would have seen an environmentally damaging “population explosion” are unfounded. China’s birth rate would have fallen without coercion, in the normal course of economic development. Today, even in Sub Saharan Africa, the world’s poorest region, birth rates are falling voluntarily. Projections of world population growth show that the total population of the planet will decline in the long run. Moreover, population growth can coincide with rising prosperity. China’s remarkable economic growth and poverty eradication over the last few decades have been the result of economic liberalization, not regulating women’s allowable number of births.



While many accounts of coerced sterilization and forced abortion have emerged from the Uyghur community, the Han ethnic majority is not exempt. Even as the Chinese national government now frets about falling birth rates’ impact on the country’s economy, many revenue‐​hungry local governments throughout China continue to fine couples for illegal births and enforce childbearing limits.



For example, last year, one couple in Shandong province, who could not afford a fine of $9,570 for violating family planning regulations had their life savings (around $3,000) seized. Also last year, a school teacher in Guangdong lost her job after giving birth to a third child in violation of the two‐​child policy. There are now many hopeful signs that the Chinese government may move toward ending childbearing limits, but that has not yet come to pass.



Today, neo‐​Malthusian thinking is seeing a resurgence. At the 2020 World Economic Forum in Switzerland, famed primatologist Jane Goodall opined, “All these [environmental] things we talk about wouldn’t be a problem if there was the size of population that there was 500 years ago.” The world population 500 years ago is estimated at 420–540 million people, or around 6.7 billion fewer people than today.



Goodall is far from alone in her belief that population growth is an urgent problem. Public figures, ranging from Prince Harry and Bill Nye “the Science Guy” to television host Bill Maher, have all recently expressed overpopulation fears. Last year, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio‐​Cortez (D-NY) famously questioned the morality of childbearing in the face of climate change, asking, “Is it OK to still have children?”



Countering neo‐​Malthusianism is especially critical now given the recent prominence of such thinking. To learn more about the history of coercive population control inspired by neo‐​Malthusianism, and the problematic policies that persist today—including the forced mass sterilization of Uyghur women—consider reading my new paper, _Neo‐​Malthusianism and Coercive Population Control in China and India_.

"Global carbon emissions from the fossil fuel industry could fall by a record 2.5bn tonnes this year, a reduction of 5%, as the coronavirus pandemic triggers the biggest drop in demand for fossil fuels on record. The unprecedented restrictions on travel, work and industry due to the coronavirus is expected to cut billions of barrels of oil, trillions of cubic metres of gas and millions of tonnes of coal from the global energy system in 2020 alone, according to data commissioned by the Guardian. This would lead to the fossil fuel industry’s biggest drop in CO2 emissions on record, in a single year eclipsing the carbon slumps triggered by the largest recessions of the last 50 years combined. Climate experts expected global carbon emissions from fossil fuels and cement production to rise in 2020, from an estimated 36.8bn tonnes of carbon dioxide last year. Instead, emissions may fall by about 5%, or 2.5bn tonnes of CO2, to its lowest levels in about a decade. Dr Fatih Birol, the head of the International Energy Agency, has warned against viewing the steep decline in emissions from fossil fuels as a climate triumph.  “This decline is happening because of the economic meltdown in which thousands of people are losing their livelihoods, not as a result of the right government decisions in terms of climate policies,” he said. “The reason we want to see emissions decline is because we want a more livable planet and happier, healthier people.” The fossil fuel analysis undertaken by Rystad Energy, a Norwegian energy consultancy, found a sharp contraction in GDP and the abrupt halt of flights and driving could cause the world’s oil demand to fall by more than five times the drop in demand triggered by the global financial crisis in 2008. The analysts estimate demand for crude will fall by an average of 11m barrels of oil a day this year, or 4bn barrels in total. This alone would cut 1.8bn tonnes of CO2 emissions, which would otherwise have contributed to the global climate crisis this year, according to Rystad. The analysts also expected a slump in electricity use and heavy industry to drive demand for gas and coal down by about 2.3% each, erasing carbon emissions from each fossil fuel by 200mtonnes and 500m tonnes respectively. Erik Holm Reiso, a senior partner at Rystad, said: “The coronavirus pandemic is an unprecedented event for energy markets, which will have a substantial impact on the world’s total carbon emissions. “The last time demand for oil contracted, during the financial crisis in 2008 to 2009, demand fell by 1.3m barrels of oil a day. But Covid-19 could cause oil demand to fall by more than five times as much.” The unprecedented drop in oil demand will emerge in large part due the global aviation industry, he said. Typically there are about 99,700 commercial flights per day but the crackdown on non-essential travel to curb the spread of the virus could see air traffic fall by an average of almost a quarter over the year. Fewer cars on the road will also dent demand for petrol and diesel by an average of 9.4% over the year, shrinking oil demand in 2020 by an average of 2.6m barrels of oil a day. The analysts say the use of transport fuels may start recovering in the second half of the year, but found demand would lag the figures recorded last year. Energy demand in China, the world’s biggest importer of oil, is expected to begin recovering next month, four months after the outbreak in the Wuhan province. However it will not make a full return to normal levels until September at the earliest, according to Rystad. This could stoke a slow rise in global energy demand in the second half of 2020 but a recovery to 2019 levels is not forecast for this year. Resio said: “The real question is over the long-term impact of the virus. If we learn that remote working can work people may begin to question whether we need to take long haul flights to meet people in person. This could alter whether demand for oil ever recovers to the levels we have seen in previous years.” However, Birol said if governments didn’t take the right measures to include support for clean energy in new economic stimulus packages “then this decline could be easily wiped out in the rebound of the economy”, once Covid-19 is brought under control. He said: “These figures are important and impressive. But they don’t make me happy. For me it’s more important about what happens next year, and the year after that.”"

Assume you are a scientist and have been given a major financial grant to prove that the mythical unicorn really did exist.



You know that as long as you can demonstrate some progress in showing the unicorn might have existed, your financial grant will be renewed each year, provided some other scientist does not come out with substantial evidence that the unicorn could not have existed.



Under such conditions, you would have a very strong incentive to disregard much of the evidence that the unicorn could not have existed and each year provide only the data that could demonstrate that the unicorn might have existed. You also would have a very strong incentive to attack any scientist who raised serious questions or provided evidence that the unicorn could not have existed.





It has been all too evident that many in the man‐​made‐​global‐​warming camp have vested interests in certain outcomes because of the government grants they receive.



You even might go so far as to refer to them with the disparaging term “unicorn deniers” and attempt to use your influence with other scientists who also are receiving grants dependent on the existence of the unicorn to try to prevent the unicorn deniers from publishing their findings in well‐​regarded scientific journals.



The recently released e‐​mails (by whistleblowers or hackers, depending on your prejudice) between some of the best‐​known scientists behind global warming showed that they succumbed to the all‐​too‐​human tendency to protect their turfs and pocketbooks, despite the evidence.



As an economist, not a climatologist, I have followed the debate carefully for years. It has been all too evident that many in the man‐​made‐​global‐​warming camp have vested interests in certain outcomes because of the government grants they receive. (This is not meant to imply that most scientists have sold their integrity for government grants.)



It has been known for a couple of hundred years that the Earth goes through regular cooling and warming cycles. The legitimate debate is about how much man‐​made carbon dioxide (and other greenhouse gases) contributes to the current cycle, if at all, and whether it is more cost‐​effective (or even possible) to try to modify climate change or just adapt to it through engineering changes (e.g., the dikes in Holland) and building at a greater distance from the shoreline.



My colleagues at the Cato Institute found many highly qualified climate scientists (hundreds of whom were willing to sign a public statement) who seriously questioned much of the “science” behind many of the legislative and other public policy demands of the global warming lobby.



Members of the media are usually quick to understand and publicize conflicts of interest for public officials when it comes to road‐​building contracts and the like but seem to be blind to the conflicts of interest for scientists and others who claim to be impartial scholars. The United Nations’ report on climate change is considered by many in the media and the political world to be a gold‐​plated standard of truth when it comes to the climate‐​change evidence — which we now know is tainted. What the media and the political class should be doing is seeking out those highly qualified climatologists and other relevant scientific experts with no financial or other vested interests (which include grants from either governments or industries that may have an economic interest) to provide independent evaluations of the evidence and arguments from all sources.



In my own field of economics, we find an international tax‐​increase lobby, almost all of whose members are dependent on government grants (directly or indirectly), to be endlessly lobbying for more taxes and regulations, which increase the power of the political class. The lobby routinely ignores the evidence that almost all governments tax and spend at rates far above the welfare and growth‐​maximizing rates and that more taxes and bigger expenditures reduce both economic opportunity and individual liberty.



Again ignoring the evidence from almost everywhere that more government makes things worse rather than better, the proponents of higher taxes also argue that government is about the only force for good and, if government only had more money, it would manage things better and waste less.



Sen. Judd Gregg, New Hampshire Republican, and Sen. Kent Conrad, North Dakota Democrat, have proposed a new, bipartisan commission to deal with the government deficit, and it already has 31 sponsors. The advocates know it ultimately will recommend some cuts in government spending and increases in some taxes. They are either intellectually ignorant or corrupt because the effort is focused on the deficit, which is only a residual of the real problem — excessive government spending — which neither party has the intellectual and moral courage to address seriously.



Can you think of something much more intellectually dishonest than saying health care reform will insure many millions more, will not add to the deficit, will not result in any increases in taxes for anyone but the rich and will “bend the cost curve down”? Hmmm.



Businesspeople are fined and even sent to jail for making false claims about what their goods or services will do. If false‐​claims standards were applied to the political class (and those who report this misinformation as fact) how many in Congress, the administration and mainstream media would be out of jail?

"**Pubs, restaurants and bars will be subject to stricter Covid-19 restrictions in the run up to Christmas, the first minister has said.**
The new restrictions, which have not yet been finalised, will come into force from Friday, 4 December.
They may be based on the system in some parts of Scotland where no alcohol can be served.
Cinemas, bowling alleys and indoor entertainment venues will also have to shut before the festive break.
A date for these to close has not yet been agreed.
Mark Drakeford said action was needed as case rates continued to rise in the run up to Christmas.
But the Welsh Conservatives said any new restrictions would be a ""real blow"" for businesses who had already ""suffered greatly"", while Plaid Cymru said the lack of detail was leaving employers unable to prepare.
Pubs, bars and restaurants had only reopened on 9 November after the Wales-wide 17-day lockdown, and are currently made to close at 22:00 GMT.
Ahead of the announcement people working in the hospitality industry had warned any further restrictions before Christmas would be a ""big blow"".
Plans for the new rules have not yet been finalised, but BBC Wales understands one option being considered is the ""level three"" Scottish system, where venues are banned from selling alcohol and have to close at 18:00.
The R rate - the number of people each infected person passed the virus on to - has risen again to 1.4 in Wales, with the rate needing to be below one for the number of cases to fall.
In England about 55 million people are being placed under the tightest level of lockdown rules from 2 December, when an England-wide lockdown ends and a new tiered system is introduced.
Speaking at the Welsh Government's coronavirus briefing, Mr Drakeford said Wales had to use the ""coming weeks"" to reduce the spread of the virus, to ""create more headroom for the Christmas period"".
Mr Drakeford said while case rates had fallen following the 17-day firebreak, as people had resumed socialising it they had risen ""faster and further than we anticipated"", and action was needed.
""This does not mean a return to the firebreak arrangements, but the cabinet has agreed to take further specific and targeted action to reinforce the current national measures we have place,"" he said.
Mr Drakeford said he could ""not rule anything out for the future"" in a bid to curb the spread of the virus.
Non-essential retail, hairdressers, gyms and leisure centres will stay open, it was confirmed.
Speaking of the new measures for pubs, bars and restaurants, Mr Drakeford added: ""I know this will be a worrying time for all working in the industry.
""We will be working over the weekend with partners to finalise the details of the new arrangements and to put in place a further major package of financial support to respond to those changes.
""I will give further details about the package on Monday.""
Claire Vaughan, programme manager at Chapter cinema in Cardiff, said: ""Globally no cases of coronavirus have been traced back to a visit to the cinema.
""Cinemas are a low-risk way of spending time outside the house at a time when the mental health of people in Wales is a huge concern.
""Masks are worn, there are air circulation units and no one is facing another person... Not everyone is living in a warm, safe home - many people need these spaces to be open.""
Liam Evans-Ford, Theatr Clwyd's executive director, added the announcement had been a ""huge surprise"".
""This is devastating for our business, for our employees, for our freelancers and for our communities,"" he said.
Sian Shepphard, owner of the Horse and Jockey in Pontypool, opened the pub in August so has not been eligible for government support.
""The main problem is we are trying to get people to stay at home but it is ruining our businesses,"" she said.
""I employ over 25 staff here - we are a really family-run business. We are all family - how am I supposed to put food on the table for them?""
Phil James, a customer at the pub, said the potential changes would affect his Christmas plans.
""We just don't know what arrangement to make at the end of the day - people have to know. You come out to socialise - people want to be social for Christmas, alcohol is a part of it.""
Simon Buckley, chairman of The Brewers of Wales, said: ""Is this finally the straw that will break the industry's back?
""We as an industry are being thrown to the wind, and the looming prospect of significant job losses seems to count for nothing.""
Plaid's economy spokeswoman Helen Mary Jones said: ""They [pubs and restaurants] don't know if they're being asked to close altogether again, to only do takeaways, to have restricted opening without alcohol.
""So, they can't really prepare. They need to be given the maximum length of time to prepare.""
Clwyd West member of the Senedd Darren Millar called for a targeted rather than a Wales-wide blanket approach.
""It is grossly unfair to impose the same level of restrictions in Conwy and Denbighshire as Covid-19 hotspots in south Wales,"" he said.
""The virus is circulating at different rates in different parts of the country.""
Mr Drakeford insisted there were no plans to introduce regionalised ""tiered"" restrictions, similar to those coming into force in England.
He said there was no case for aligning the Welsh and English systems to ensure no-one was left out of UK-wide Treasury schemes that offer financial assistance to businesses affected by lockdown measures.
""We don't lose out on any UK system by having a single tier for Wales, so there is no disadvantage to us in that,"" he said.
He added: ""The advice we have is that a single set of arrangements for Wales works best, is easiest to communicate and delivers benefits in all parts of Wales.""
Pembrokeshire councillor John Davies welcomed the restrictions after a spike in cases in his ward, Cilgerran, linked to the recent outbreak in nearby Cardigan.
He told Newyddion 9: ""If people aren't willing to exercise common sense and be citizens of responsibility towards each other, there is no other option.
""We've seen what happens in this part of the world when people act in a selfish manner.""
Mr Drakeford said he had no plans to allow schools to close early for Christmas.
Teaching union UCAC had called for classrooms to be shut on 11 December and for lessons to be moved online amid fears teachers and pupils may have to isolate on Christmas Day.
But Mr Drakeford said ministers would do ""everything we can"" to keep schools working up until the Christmas holiday.
He added: ""It is more important for our children not to miss out further on the education that is planned for them for the whole of the rest of this term and that's what we will be working to achieve."""

Share this...FacebookTwitterLooking at the temperature chart of the Danish Meteorological Institute, we see that the Arctic above 80°N has turned quite frosty. The polar bears are probably the only ones enjoying it.

Chart above shows the years 2004, 2010, and 2013. Source: http://ocean.dmi.dk/arctic/meant80n.uk.php.
Checking the charts from the years before, we see that today’s Arctic temperature is a hair lower than the low of 2010 (it’s very close), and is thus the lowest since 2004. At Twitter a couple a days ago I think it was Ryan Maue who said that the Arctic was in for a cold snap, and so it’s possible temperatures above 80°N may even drop further before this ends.
Will be interesting to watch in the days ahead. I wonder if they’ll blame it on warming.

President Obama in his recent SOTU address said that “this is our generation’s sputnik moment” referring to the need to use science and technology to develop cheaper clean energy (among other things).  It seems the Chinese were listening because last week they announced a focused effort to achieve technological leadership in thorium molten salt reactors.
From EnergyFromThorium
The People’s Republic of China has initiated a research and development project in thorium molten-salt reactor technology, it was announced in the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) annual conference on Tuesday, January 25.  An article in the Wenhui News followed on Wednesday (Google English translation).  Chinese researchers also announced this development on the Energy from Thorium Discussion Forum.
See the Press report (Chinese) below along with partial translation: 
http://whb.news365.com.cn/yw/201101/t20110126_2944856.htm
(partial google translation follows) 
“Yesterday, as the Chinese Academy of Sciences started the first one of the strategic leader in science and technology projects, “the future of advanced nuclear fission energy – nuclear energy, thorium-based molten salt reactor system” project was officially launched. The scientific goal is to use 20 years or so, developed a new generation of nuclear energy systems, all the technical level reached in the trial and have all intellectual property rights.”
What is a “thorium-based molten salt reactor system”?   Please see this previous WUWT post on this technology.

Currently there is no US effort to develop a thorium MSR.  Readers of this blog and Charles Barton’s Nuclear Green blog know that there has been a grass-roots effort underway for over five years to change this.  The formation of the Thorium Energy Alliance and the International Thorium Energy Organization have been other attempted to convince governmental and industrial  leaders to carefully consider the potential of thorium in a  liquid-fluoride reactor.  There have been many international  participants in the TEA and IThEO conferences, but none from China.
Will the US accept the challenge or allow the Chinese to dominate advanced nuclear technology too?   Using a technology invented in the US 40 years ago no less!
This isn’t a “Sputnik moment” Mr. President, it’s a “shit or get off the pot” moment for US energy policy. The US excelled at the space race, partly because of the swift kick in the pants that Sputnik provided. Perhaps this announcement will be the embarrassment like Sputnik for the US government that will compel them to finally do something about our energy future besides tilt at windmills.

The bad news this morning on the impact of both the federal stimulus and the Cash for Clunkers program should not come as a surprise to anyone who has paid attention to the history of government intervention in the economy.   
  
  
New data that the jobs created by the stimulus have been overstated by thousands is compelling, but it’s really a secondary issue. The primary issue is that the government cannot “create” anything without hurting something else. To “create” jobs, the government must first extract wealth from the economy via taxation, or raise the money by issuing debt. Regardless of whether the burden is borne by present or future taxpayers, the result is the same: job creation and economic growth are inhibited.   
  
  
At the same time the government is taking undeserved credit for “creating jobs,” a new analysis of the Cash for Clunkers program by Edmunds​.com shows that most cars bought with taxpayer help would have been purchased anyhow. The same analysis finds the post‐​Clunker car sales would have been higher in the absence of the program, which proves that the program merely altered the timing of auto purchases.   
  
  
Once again, the government claims to have “created” economic growth, but the reality is that Cash for Clunkers had no positive long‐​term effect and actually destroyed wealth in the process.   
  
  
Right now businesses and entrepreneurs are hesitant to make investments or add new workers because they’re worried about what Washington’s interventions could mean for their bottom lines. The potential for higher taxes, health care mandates, and costly climate change legislation are all being cited by businesspeople as reasons why further investment or hiring is on hold. Unless this “regime uncertainty” subsides, the U.S. economy could be in for sluggish growth for a long time to come.

From NASA Goddard, something reminiscent of last year’s blocking high for the heat wave in Russia.
NASA Satellite Observes Unusually Hot July in the Great Plains
Andrey Savtchenko and Adam Voiland NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md.
Much of the United States sweated through an unusually humid heat wave during July, a month that brought record-breaking temperatures to many areas across the Great Plains. As temperatures soared, NASA satellites observed the unusual weather from above.
The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS), an instrument launched on the Aqua satellite in 2002, is unique in its ability to yield highly accurate data about the troposphere, the lowest layer of the atmosphere and the part that most directly affects life on Earth.
Hot temperatures struck Texas and Oklahoma particularly hard, AIRS observed. Large swaths of both of these states persistently experienced highs above 100° F (311 K) during the day for the month of July. Nights offered only minimal relief with low temperatures averaging close to 90° F (305 K) for the month. That’s about 20° F warmer, both day and night, than the average July temperatures for the past eight years of AIRS observations.
  Night and day time temperatures during July were significantly warmer than has been typical over the last eight years. As seen in the top graphic, the heat remained anonymously over much of the country at night. (Credit: NASA/Goddard Earth Science Data and Information Center)
› Larger image 
AIRS also offered clues about what may have caused the persistent heat spell. Domes of high atmospheric surface pressure (corresponding to the red colors in the figure below) normally intensify in the summer over both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. However, AIRS data shows they were abnormally strong in July.

  An area of high pressure in the North Atlantic likely helped fuel the heat wave. (Credit: NASA/Goddard Earth Science Data and Information Center)
› Larger image 
Meanwhile, AIRS data for the month of July (below) reveals a clock-wise vortex of winds (shown with arrows beow) driven by the high pressure in the North Atlantic. The vortex continuously pumped hot and humid air from the tropics through the heart of the Gulf of Mexico and into much of the continental United States throughout July.
  Note the hot tropical air being pumped towards Texas and Oklahoma. (Credit: NASA/Goddard Earth Science Data and Information Center)
› Larger image 
The jet stream, which typically produces loops around low-pressure areas that break off and brings cooler air and precipitation, offered little relief. As seen below, the flow of the jet stream (approximated by green and yellow) instead consistently bulged over the high-pressure aloft over the United States (shown in red).
  Note the unusual bulge in the jet stream over the center of the country. (Credit: NASA/Goddard Earth Science Data and Information Center)

AIRS data are distributed by the Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md. AIRS is managed by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., under contract to NASA. JPL is a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. GOES-5 is a product of the Global Modeling and Assimilation Office at Goddard Space Flight Center.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt used to be that weather extremes were “proof of man-made warming”. But because that argument didn’t seem to sway anyone, the warmists have taken it a level higher: now even the storm’s path is proof. This is how desperate they’ve become. Thirty years ago, such people would have been committed to a nuthouse.

Chart Source: NOAA, modified by NoTrickZone. 
Normally nor’easters more or less follow a path parallel to the East Coast. But this time Sandy took a sharp turn westwards into New Jersey before heading north again. If Sandy had followed the usual path, it would have left the East Coast pretty much unscathed and the storm would have been considered “normal” and gone by more or less unnoticed; everyone would have yawned.
But Sandy made a jog to the west, and now the warmist bedwetting media jackasses are freaking out seriously, hailing it as irrefutable proof of man-made climate change, dubbing it a “mega-storm“, “superstorm“, “monsterstorm“, … a “Frankenstorm“!
All because of a jog in its path.
The German leftist TAZ even tries to add Biblical proportions to it, writing:
With regards to the emergency, the Pope has called for solidarity and a readiness to aid.”
The warmists are seriously grasping at any straw. The barometer has gotten that low for them.

"**Work is set to begin on one of the UK's largest energy retrofit projects of its kind.**
The scheme will see almost 650 existing homes in Penderry, Swansea, installed with energy storage and smart energy management technology.
Social housing provider Pobl is behind the project, which is backed by Â£3.5m in European Union funding.
Housing Minister Julie James hailed it as ""transformational"".
It is hoped the upgrades will allow the homes to generate up to 60% of their own electricity, reducing bills and carbon emissions by as much 350 tonnes per year.
Local resident Brian Mcallen took part in a smart energy pilot scheme and welcomed news of the roll-out to the wider community.
""It allows people to really see how green energy works and how much money they can save to use elsewhere. It can be a real eye-opener,"" he said.
Individual or communal batteries will be installed for the homes, allowing them to harness power generated via linked solar panels.
Every home will also be fitted with a new smart thermostat and intelligent heating control, managed through an app.
Work will begin in the new year.
""Fuel prices and climate change are two sides of the same crisis, with people in Wales still among the most fuel-poor in the UK,"" said Solitaire Pritchard, Pobl's head of regeneration.
""We are committed to identifying new ways of making homes more environmentally and financially sustainable - and that includes our existing homes as well as our new developments.""
The project has been delivered in collaboration with renewable energy supplier Sero.
Lessons learned it from will inform the wider roll-out of renewable energy technology in thousands of homes throughout the Swansea Bay City Region, as part of the Â£1.3bn City Deal, in the Homes as Power Stations project - subject to UK and Welsh Government approval.
This would see energy efficiency technology retrofitted to 7,000 homes with a further 3,300 new build homes also benefiting as part of the project, which is led by Neath Port Talbot council.
In July, housing bodies called for thousands of existing homes in Wales to be retro-fitted with energy-saving improvements to create jobs as part of the economic recovery from coronavirus."
"Changes in seabird numbers are probably the best way to monitor the quality of the marine environment. And things are looking bad. In the past 50 years, the world population of marine birds has more than halved. What’s worse is that few people have noticed. Puffins, guillemots, penguins and albatrosses are all in decline. How do we know this? There are three main ways of checking on numbers. First and best are long-term population studies: counts of individuals or pairs at their breeding colonies made in a systematic, rigorous way each year at established “study plots”. For instance, I have studied the same population of guillemots on Skomer Island in Wales since 1972. Consistent, careful methodology is the key here, but it is labour intensive.  Second, are one-off counts made every ten years or so over larger areas. This has occurred in the UK, starting with the census known as “Operation Seafarer” in 1969-70, and with the most recent survey last year. This method provides estimates of the size of the overall population of different species but is less good at detecting small changes in numbers. The third way is by counting the bodies of seabirds washed up on the shoreline – usually referred to as beached bird surveys. Regular, systematic counts along set lengths of shoreline provide background levels of mortality. Occasionally, numbers spike in what in seabird parlance is known as a “wreck”, as occurred in 2014 when more than 50,000 seabirds, mainly guillemots and puffins, were washed up on the west coast of Britain and France.  Seabird wrecks have been known about for a long time, but they are becoming more common. Wrecked seabirds are usually emaciated, having usually starved to death, indicating a catastrophic failure in their food supply. This is exactly what happened in late 2016 on the remote island of St Paul, in the Bering Sea between Alaska and Russia. According to a new study published in the journal PLOS ONE, around 285 tufted puffins were found dead over a three month period – many times more than the usual background level of death. Note, the tufted puffin is a bigger, chunkier, darker bird than its relative the Atlantic Puffin that breeds around Britain’s shores.  A total of 285 doesn’t sound dramatic, but it is well known that only a fraction of the birds that die get washed up and found. The authors of this report use a variety of sophisticated methods to estimate the true mortality and come up with an estimate of between 2,740 and 7,600 – and this from an estimated tufted puffin population on St Paul of 7,000 individuals (suggesting obviously that if the upper estimate is right the event also killed birds from elsewhere). This was far from being a trivial event. Indeed, it seems to be part of massive shift in the marine environment, a “Pacific marine heat wave”. This is global warming writ large upon the seas, causing changes in the abundance and distribution of plankton, with knock-on effects on the fish and invertebrate species that tufted puffins and other marine birds need to feed on. Seabird wrecks are often associated with stormy sea conditions (as in the UK in 2014), which themselves are a symptom of climate change. Yes, we’ve always had storms, but storms are occurring more frequently and are more intense than previously. High winds and rough seas are thought to disperse fish shoals and make it hard for seabirds to find enough food.  But the puffin wreck in the Bering Sea was not linked to stormy conditions. Instead, the scientists involved think that warming of the seas by just a couple of degrees was enough to reduce the availability of food. Add to this the fact that puffins were moulting – replacing their feathers – at this time of year, placing extra energetic demands on them, and probably limiting their ability to search for food over a wide area. The result: starvation. In terms of the global seabird population, the events around St Paul Island in 2016 and 2017 may seem trivial – a few thousand birds lost. But this seabird wreck is part of a much bigger picture of ongoing decline that is almost certainly caused by ongoing climate change.  We mustn’t get used to such events and we cannot afford to ignore the signs that climate change is not just continuing, but accelerating, and as that happens populations of seabirds (and many other forms of wildlife) will continue to decline. We need to ensure we have robust monitoring systems in place to document these depressing changes in bird numbers, and we need to do everything we can to reduce the root cause: climate change.

In my Britannica Blog column today I look at some brand‐​new examples of what might seem to be liberal bias at NPR and PBS: 



NPR’s _Diane Rehm Show_ devoted an hour to Sen. Bernie Sanders, the independent socialist from Vermont, talking about his new book _The Speech_. But it looks like Diane has not interviewed Sen. Rand Paul, the constitutional conservative from Kentucky, about his new book _The Tea Party Goes to Washington_ , even though it’s selling better than Sanders’s book. It’s pretty clear to book publicists that it’s much easier to get a liberal author on the _Diane Rehm Show_ than a conservative or libertarian author.   
  
  
Meanwhile, this week PBS is featuring the latest in its program _Journey to Planet Earth_ , this episode featuring “environmental visionary Lester Brown,” the long‐​time president of the Worldwatch Institute. The episode, “Plan B: Mobilizing To Save Civilization,” “delivers a clear and unflinching message – either confront the realities of climate change or suffer the consequences of lost civilizations and failed political states.” Matt Damon hosts. But Lester Brown’s decades‐​long predictions about environmental disasters have been wrong more often than the 5.9 million NCAA brackets filled out on ESPN. See this review from 1999 or this one from 2000 or this one from 2009. Meanwhile, a PBS documentary featuring the ideas of Julian Simon, who challenged doomsday orthodoxy and notably got things right? Don’t bet on it.

"Not In My Back Yard, or NIMBY-ism as it is known, is one thing, but the prospect of fracking for shale gas in rock deep underground has thrown up a new type of protest: Not Under My Back Yard. Following unsolicited drilling for oil under his property, Mohammed Al Fayed brought a case in 2010 claiming a fraction of the extraction proceeds. Under UK law, all mineral rights belong to the Crown for it to licence, and the case was thrown out, but a small fine was levied against the drillers for trespass. This has led to NUMBY-ism, where land owners, despite having no ownership of the oil, gas, or mineral resources under their land, make efforts to prevent exploitation deep under their property. This seems odd, especially to those in cities. With London in particular, many new infrastructure projects such as Crossrail run just a few tens of metres below thousands of domestic and commercial properties. In densely populated areas, negotiating with each and every property owner would make these projects unmanageable, and the benefits of more and better public transport would not be felt. This transport infrastructure that carries passengers from the country to the city and within it benefits rural and urban dwellers alike; why shouldn’t the same hold in the countryside?  Whether or not a land or property owner has a direct interest in exploring for shale gas or preventing it, the current proposals focus on compensation – drilling companies must pay hundreds of thousands of pounds to communities affected – rather than permission. With the potential for court cases brought by NUMBYs to prevent drillers from getting to work, the government plans to make provisions that change the definition of trespass – part of the Infrastructure Bill mentioned in the Queen’s Speech, with details awaiting the outcome of consultation. Firms – or at least one, Cuadrilla – are now submitting drilling applications to local county councils to recommence fracking in earnest. With high levels of truck movements for a year or more, fracking is noisy and invasive to the immediate area around the well. During this time a considerable amount of water must be sourced and blasted deep below the surface, up to two miles down, at high pressure to free the gas from the shale rock. Much of this will flow back, bringing residues with it. And on top of this drillers must ensure the borehole captures the gas without letting it escape around the well, especially at shallow depths where it could contaminate the water table. It’s time we found out whether these risks can be managed. The possible disturbance from earthquakes, which stopped Cuadrilla’s Lancashire drilling last time, are a greater risk to the borehole infrastructure itself than to the local community, and so the driller has the greatest incentives to minimise them. The challenges of not just drilling but drilling safely have not been taken lightly and concerns are still key to the choice of drilling location. But the site is still key, and should allow access to a wide shale bed accessible by horizontal drilling. We can’t allow the rise of NUMBY-ism to prevent this. There are risks to the driller too; once the investment in prospecting and drilling has been borne, the quantity of gas from the shale bed may not match expectations. Without a return on investment, there may be no future investment. For a limited number of sample wells and from as small a number of plots as possible, if the gas flow is insufficient then few if any new fields would be progressed. The communities that experienced the drilling could be compensated for their disruption, and the drillers would simply pack up and leave. With North Sea oil and gas declining, the UK needs another comparable energy source if it is not to become more dependent on imported energy or face volatile and rising prices. If successful, the energy consumer and tax payer will benefit as well as the gas producer who takes considerable investment risk. Ultimately the greatest risk is not doing anything to ensure a continued energy supply. We need to gather results now from a sufficient number of wells to resolve if shale gas can make a substantial contribution to the UK’s energy position or not, and that means removing some of the barriers that currently prevent it."

"**Americans have been holding subdued celebrations for Thanksgiving, as the country grapples with its coronavirus epidemic - one of the world's worst.**
Some traditions have continued, like the annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City, which was closed to spectators.
Many have also travelled home to celebrate the holiday, despite warnings from health officials.
More than three million people are reported to have travelled through US airports from Friday to Sunday in what was the busiest travel weekend since the outbreak began in mid-March.
But the number is around half the usual figure for Thanksgiving travel, and many people have opted out of seeing friends and family for the holiday.
Many still managed to mark the occasion in different ways.
For those living in sunnier climes, it was a bit easier to socialise outdoors.
Thanksgiving, which sees Americans gather with their families for festivities on a scale rivalling Christmas, falls on the fourth Thursday of November. This year is the holiday's 400th anniversary.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhat follows is the story of how editors at renowned German weekly Die Zeit completely botched the translation of English text passages to German, thus making their German story completely erroneous, and far more sensational.

Climate change threatens the global supply of noodles, Die Zeit claims. Source: www.kaltesonne.de
================================================
Embarrassing translation blunders in climate-alarm article by Zeit online: A welcome distortion of meaning?
By Dr Sebastian Lüning and Prof Fritz Vahrenholt
Translated/edited by P Gosselin
The climate catastrophe is known to be responsible for almost all of the world’s ills. Supposedly it will also be responsible for the demise of the noodle. At least that’s what our favorite newspaper Die Zeit told its readers in a recent online article.
The Die Zeit article is a translation of an English-language article by Mark Hertsgaard which appeared a week earlier at The Daily Beast, an Internet news page associated with Newsweek.
Let’s take a look at what’s going on with the noodle catastrophe. Die Zeit writes in German:
Wissenschaftler haben starke Belege für einen direkten Zusammenhang zwischen den steigenden Temperaturen und den weltweit sinkenden Erträgen in der Weizenproduktion. Allein in den vergangenen 50 Jahren sank die Weizenproduktion um 5,5 Prozent, während die durchschnittliche Temperatur anstieg.”
Which in English is:
Scientists have strong evidence of a direct relation between rising temperatures and falling worldwide yields of wheat production. In the past 50 years alone wheat production fell about 5.5%, while the average temperature rose.”
Oh man. That doesn’t sound good. The world’s population is growing and growing and wheat production over the last five decades has dropped. And that despite the ongoing mechanization, genetic improvements of seeds and well-designed irrigation systems. That half degree of warming since 960 is a real wheat killer and CO2 is a really bad noodle pestilence!
Yet, something appears fishy about the whole thing. That’s what an astute reader at the Wetterzentrale forum thought, and so he took the time to compare the Die Zeit German text to the original English text. In doing so, he discovered gross translation errors, which obviously somehow escaped the attention of the climate-activist editorial office. Here’s the original English:
Already, a mere 1 degree Fahrenheit of global temperature rise over the past 50 years has caused a 5.5 percent decline in wheat production compared to what would have occurred in the absence of global warming, according to a study published by David Lobell, a professor at Stanford University’s Center on Food Security and the Environment.”
Wheat production over the last 50 years namely has not decreased at all. To the contrary, global wheat production actually tripled during that time period (see Figure 1). The original English text says the rise in wheat production was 5% less than what it would have occurred had there been no climate warming. This is like a millionaire complaining that he made only 500,000 euros last year, and not the 525,000 euros he would have made had the lousy euro-crisis not interfered. Of course, we don’t need to feel bad about the “loss” the millionaire had to take. The same is true with the “missing” wheat. If anything we should feel bad for the translator who mangled the meaning, and for the climate editorial team at Die Zeit, who, because of their religious zealotry, have long abandoned the standards of science (see for example our blog report “The Climate Mercenaries: Investigative Reporters of  ZEIT Join In On The Holy Climate War“).

Figure 1: Global wheat production of the last 50 years. Data: FAO, wattsupwiththat.com (Willis Eschenbach)
Let’s read more of the quality translation from that quality weekly Die Zeit, which wrote in German:
Überall auf der Welt ändert sich gerade die Art und Weise, wie der Weizen angebaut werden kann. Drei Viertel der weltweiten Weizenproduktion kommen aus der Mittelmeerregion. Der Klimawandel wird Südeuropa sogar noch härter treffen als North Dakota.”

google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";
google_ad_width = 200;
google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




In English this is:
Everywhere in the world, the methods of how wheat can be planted are now changing. Three quarters of the worldwide wheat production comes from the Mediterranean region. Climate change will hit Southern Europe even harder than North Dakota.”
Wow, three quarters of worldwide wheat production comes from the Mediterranean region. That’s really heavy. China, Russia, India and die USA are left way behind in the dust of the Mediterranean wheat powerhouse. What’s the secret of the Mediterranean wheat farmers?
Utter nonsense. This couldn’t be more embarrassing. The climate quality assurance of Die Zeit had failed once again.
The reality is that wheat production is pretty much distributed all across the globe. China, Russia, India and the USA are all in the same league as the EU (Figure 2). In the real figures there’s not a trace of any wheat dominance. And certainly not when one considers durum wheat, which is especially important for noodle production.

Figure 2: Global overview of wheat producers. Source: Seekingalpha.com
Author Mark Hertsgaard then plays the climate-catastrophe card, predicting a great number of droughts and heat waves by 2050, based on dubious IPCC models. That would strongly and negatively impact wheat and noodles at the Mediterranean. Die Zeit writes:
Allein in Italien und Frankreich werden die Ernten bis zum Jahr 2050 um bis zu 15 Prozent zurückgehen, weil Hitzewellen und Dürren die Regionen heimsuchen werden, schätzt die Europäische Umweltagentur.”
Which in English is:
Alone in Italy and France, harvests will drop by up to 15% by the year 2050 because heat waves and droughts will afflict the regions, estimates the European Environment Agency.”
But even the European Environment Agency indeed meant something different from what Die Zeit wanted to understand:
As the frequency and intensity of heat waves and drought increase, yields of nonirrigated crops are projected to decline by 5 to 15 percent in Italy and southern France by the 2050s, according to a new report by the European Environmental Agency. Yields in Spain and Portugal could fall by 15 to 25 percent.”
Have you noticed? In the original English text, they are discussing  ‘non-irrigated areas’. Die Zeit simply leaves out this seemingly unimportant detail. Here the share of irrigated areas in the Mediterranean region is today already significant and will continue to gain. These areas are impacted far less.
So how could this series of errors, misinterpretations and distortions happen? Has the Die Zeit editorial board thrown every journalistic ethic overboard? Is the climate-activist urgency so great that all means are justified?
Perhaps the end of the year is a good occasion for the editorial board to think about a wise saying by Hanns Joachim Friedrichs: “A good journlaist is one who does not become subjective with any topic, also with a good topic.”

On Inauguration Day, the Organization of the Islamic Conference, in a _New York Times_ ad (“An Invitation to a New Partnership”), told “Dear President OBAMA” that Muslims “have compelling strategic and moral reasons to cooperate and peacefully co‐​exist with the United States in particular, and with the West in general.”



Many Muslims here and elsewhere want that partnership; but some, jihadists in the name of Islam, disagree violently. In its address to our new president, the Organization of the Islamic Conference (which has permanent status at the United Nations) made no mention of its own strategic skills that resulted, on Dec. 18, in the passage by the U.N. General Assembly of a nonbinding resolution (with strong advice to its members) that condemns “defamation of religion,” especially Islam.



In a 83‐​to‐​53 vote, with 42 abstentions, the U.N. General Assembly urges nations to provide “adequate protections” in their laws or constitutions against “acts of hatred, discrimination, intimidation and coercion resulting from defamation of religions and incitement to religious hatred in general.”



Only Islam and Muslims are specifically named in this resolution against religious defamation sponsored by Uganda — on behalf of the 57‐​member Organization of the Islamic Conference — with co‐​sponsors Belarus and Venezuela. In the opposition were the United States, a majority of European countries, Japan, India and a number of other nations.



Those voting in favor say they do not want to limit free speech but do intend to stop such expressions as the 2005 Danish cartoons disrespecting the Prophet Muhammad that ignited violent protests by Muslims around the world.



Among the opponents, including myself, of this U.N. move to have its members legislate, with penalties — against such very broadly designated “religious defamation” — is Floyd Abrams, this country’s leading protector of the First Amendment in the Supreme Court and in his writings. In his Dec. 9, lecture on Global Communications Issues at the United Nations itself in New York, he cited a recent study by the European Center for Law and Justice finding “that laws based on the concept of ‘defamation of religion’ actually help to create a climate of violence.”



“Violators of these laws, as applied in most Muslim countries, are subject to the death penalty,” Abrams continued. He cited from the study a 22‐​year‐​old Hindu in Pakistan “was beaten to death by co‐​workers at a factory for allegedly committing the crime of blasphemy, which is a crime punishable by death in the country.” The three workers were “charged not with murder but with ‘failure to inform the police that blasphemy was under way.’ ”



Also in an article, _The Freedom to Criticize_ by Floyd Abrams ( _The American Jewish Congress Monthly_ , 2008), he emphasizes, and I fully agree, that the effect of what the United Nations voted for on Dec. 18 “would be just as dangerous if this did not (originally) come from the Islamic states, but came from any other group of states representing or purporting to speak for any other religion.”



Another of America’s leading First Amendment lawyers, Marc Stern, co‐​executive director of the American Jewish Congress, makes a crucial point that if this approach to “defamation of religion” were to become a crime under international law (under the impetus of the U.N. resolution): “nations would be able to seek extradition and trial abroad of persons who make statements critical or offensive to one or all faiths anywhere in the world.”



Already, for example, as _Reuters_ reported last June 4 (“Jordan Summons Danish Cartoonist on Blasphemy Charges”), that country’s prosecutor, Hassan Abdullat, subpoenaed “11 Danes for drawing and reprinting” cartoons that offend Islam. The Danes were charged — in Jordan — for “threatening the national peace.”



Under Jordanian law, _Reuters_ reported, “reproducing images of the Prophet Muhammad inside — or even outside the country — is illegal under the Jordanian Justice Act.”



One of the Danes summoned to Jordan was Kurt Westergaard, who, for years, has been subject to death threats for his cartoon, among others, of the Prophet Muhammad wearing a turban in the shape of a bomb.



When the riots and deaths following those Danish cartoons were reported in American newspapers, none of the offending cartoons were published accompanying the stories in _The New York Times_ , the _Washington Post_ and other major dailies, except the _Philadelphia Inquirer_ and the _New York Sun_. But, at the _Village Voice_ , where I then had a column, I ran the story, with the cartoon of Prophet Muhammad wearing the bomb‐​shaped turban.



I was damned if I’d be intimidated for doing my job as a reporter. For a couple of weeks, I was more vigilant than usual walking the streets, but I’m still here. What most stays in my mind is that long before the Dec. 18, 2008, resolution on defamation of religions, so much of the American free press refused to run even one of the cartoons at the core of the story, and hardly anything about the United Nations’ Dec. 18 resolution.



Did they not want to offend certain readers? Were they afraid? If the U.N. resolution became international law, the First Amendment would still protect opponents here, but think of the bloody impact on “defamers” around the world.

"Last year Japanese scientists announced they had for the first time extracted gas from offshore deposits of methane hydrate, an ice-like substance made of natural gas (methane) trapped inside water crystals.  For resource-poor Japan, which must import most of its fossil fuel supply, this could be a route to much-needed energy security, and was hailed as major breakthrough. And with potentially huge reserves of methane hydrates found in deposits around the world, depending on the technology and the need, methane hydrate could be the next important “unconventional” fossil fuel to arrive after shale gas. Methane hydrate deposits form and remain stable only under high pressure or low temperatures, such as in areas of permafrost, or beneath the pressure of hundreds of metres of water at the bottom of the ocean. The methane that it contains is usually formed by the work of tiny microbes that consume organic material buried in seafloor sediments. Sometimes the methane has a deeper origin, from the breakdown of organic material cooked at the high temperatures that occur several kilometres down in the Earth’s crust, in a similar process to the formation of oil. Once formed, it slowly percolates up through the rock towards the surface. Because there is a generous supply of organic material to regions of the deep seafloor close to the continents, these regions are believed to contain very large amounts of methane hydrate. It’s very difficult to determine an accurate estimate for the actual amount of methane hydrate lying in the oceans. The hydrate is commonly present in a distributed form, either occupying cracks in the sedimentary rocks beneath the seabed, or filling parts of the microscopic pore space within the rock. Hydrate may fill only a few percent of the available space.  Methane hydrate’s physical properties are very different from the salty water that normally fills these spaces. We can estimate some of these properties, such as sound speed or electrical resistivity, by conducting geophysical surveys. However, our surveying methods normally average these properties over volumes that are tens to hundreds of metres across, and on this scale the effect of the hydrate can be quite subtle and hard to recognise. Only a tiny fraction of the seafloor has been surveyed by these methods, so the most reliable estimates of global methane hydrate resources come from computer models. Based on estimates of the amount of organic matter present in seafloor sediments, these models make predictions of how much methane might be generated and converted to methane hydrates. When hydrates were first discovered in the oceans in the 1970s, it was thought that they might be the dominant form of organic carbon on Earth, and a much larger resource than conventional fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas. But as surveying techniques and our understanding of how methane hydrates form has improved, more recent estimates have steadily declined to below the total amount of fossil fuels. Most recent estimates are around 1,000 gigatonnes or less of carbon bound in methane. Nevertheless, hydrates probably still constitute a substantial reserve of natural gas and their resource potential has led to several nations, including the US, Japan, China, India, South Korea and Taiwan, launching large-scale hydrate exploration programmes.  Geophysical surveys are effective at estimating hydrate volumes in those areas where it is more concentrated, particularly when complemented by direct sampling in boreholes. A tell-tale sign of the presence of hydrate is the so-called “bottom-simulating reflector” (BSR). Because temperature increases with depth beneath the seafloor, at a certain depth the hydrate becomes unstable, and below this depth the methane is present in gaseous form and affects sound passing through it differently. This boundary is often a strong reflector of sound waves that roughly parallels the seabed and crosses geological structures, so it is a distinctive feature in images constructed from seismic surveys of the seabed. Exploration effort tends to be focused in areas where BSRs have been detected. Even once an accumulation of methane hydrate has been found, putting it to use an energy resource is a considerable challenge. Other than in permafrost regions, which present their own challenging, remote and hostile environment, hydrate is present only in deep water where building structures on the seabed is a significant engineering challenge.  Since it commonly lies beneath many metres of rock, using straightforward mining is not generally practical, and exploiting the gas requires removing it from the solid hydrate. This process requires either an increase in temperature or a reduction in pressure, both of which in turn require energy to achieve. Sometimes nature does the work for us and ocean warming triggers the release of gas, as may be happening near the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard. But such natural release tends to be too widely distributed to be collected easily. So the technological challenge that Japan and others face is to extract the gas and transport it to somewhere it can be used. On top of that already substantial scientific and engineering task, ideally some way of collecting and storing the resultant carbon emissions from burning the gas as energy and putting them into permanent storage is required, perhaps back under the sea floor.  For methane hydrates to be worth exploiting, all of this needs to be possible without using more energy than can be extracted from the methane, else the entire operation cannot be financially viable. And while surveying techniques aimed at locating methane hydrate deposits have improved, we are still – despite Japan’s efforts – some way from making methane hydrates pay for themselves."
"In the understorey of a tropical forest, a carpenter ant has descended from the canopy away from her regular foraging trails and staggers drunkenly along a branch. Her movements are jerky and conspicuous. She twitchily moves forwards and suddenly starts convulsing with such ferocity that she falls from the branch onto the ground before resuming her erratic, zigzaging path. This is a “zombie ant”, and she’s unwittingly become part of the lifecycle of a parasitic fungus commonly known as Cordyceps. Around noon, after several hours of climbing and aimless lurching, the ant is now no more than about 25cm above the ground, crawling aimlessly on the underside of a sapling leaf where, without warning, she forcefully sinks her powerful jaws into one of the leaf’s veins, gripping it firmly between her tightly locked mandibles. Within six hours, she is dead. After two days, white hairs bristle from between her joints and a few days later these have become a thick, brown mat covering the whole insect. A pinkish-white stalk starts to erupt from the base of the ant’s head and continues to grow. Within two weeks it has reached twice the length of the ant’s body reaching down towards the ground below. Finally, the stalk will release its spores into the air, ready to float off and infect more unsuspecting ants. Cordyceps growing out of an ants head (Source: BBC/Giphy) This bizarre behaviour was first recorded by Alfred Russell Wallace in Indonesia in 1859, but was not researched in much detail until quite recently. It has since been discovered that the fungus disrupts the normal behaviour of the ant through chemical interference in the brain, causing the infected ant to behave in ways that will improve the opportunities for the fungus to spread its spores and so reproduce. The fungus grows throughout the body cavity of the ant, using internal organs as food while the ant’s strong exoskeleton serves as a kind of capsule, protecting the fungus from drying out, being eaten, or further infection. The earliest known record of a fungus visibly parasitising an insect dates from about 105m years ago. It is a male scale insect, preserved in amber, with two fungal stalks projecting from its head. But this fossil cannot tell us if the infected insect’s regular behaviour was changed or disrupted in any way. Definitive evidence of “zombie-ant” behaviour, dating to around 48m years ago, comes from fossilised leaves that show the distinct markings on either side of leaf veins left by the lock-jawed mandibles of infected ants. Not only is this association between ant and fungus evidently ancient, it is also very common – about 1,000 species of fungal parasites of insects have been discovered so far. In this age-old struggle for survival the ants have developed adaptations to protect themselves and their nests from fungal infections. By grooming themselves and socially cleaning each other (allogrooming) they remove potentially harmful spores before they can penetrate the skin and take hold. Some ants spray poison in their nests to act as fungicides and if that fails to stop an infestation, they partition their nests by sealing off contaminated chambers.  In some cases infected individuals are carried out of the nest by healthy workers, and as a last resort the entire colony relocates, abandoning their infected nest. The fungal pathogens have evolved to become either strictly species-specific or more generalist in their choice of insect host, with some able to infect hundreds of different species. This astonishing variety of fungal pathogens and potential hosts has created some peculiar behaviour in insects as they have co-evolved to cope with the tactics of the fungi. It is sometimes difficult to know what behaviour is entirely involuntary and driven by the fungus to improve its own reproductive success, and what has evolved as a form of defence against the infection. For example, when the ant host climbs to an elevated position in what is known as “summit disease”, this behaviour increases the area over which spores can spread through wind dispersal – but it also removes the ant from close proximity to its relatives in the colony, preventing the spread of infection to its sisters. It is unclear if this behaviour is a zombie state caused by the fungus or if it is an altruistic act of self-sacrifice by the ant. If it is a deliberate act by the ant, it might be saving the rest of the colony from succumbing to the infection in what is sometimes called “adaptive suicide”. Zombie-like behaviour in insects is also caused by many other types of parasites including bacteria and even other invertebrates. This raises fascinating questions about the nature of any organism’s true independence in what are undoubtedly highly complex interrelated living systems. Zombie-ants provide us with a glimpse into this intricately tangled web of molecular influences and behavioural adaptations. It leads us to wonder who, ultimately, controls whom?"
"**Boris Johnson has defended his decision to place 55 million people in England into the two highest tiers of Covid restrictions, arguing the country needs ""simplicity and clarity"".**
The PM said measures due to come in when lockdown ends on Wednesday were more ""relaxed"" but would ""drive"" Covid down until a vaccine is available.
But a group of Tory MPs is threatening to rebel in a Commons vote on Tuesday.
If Labour backs them, this could threaten the government's majority.
There is concern that the government is adopting a ""one-size-fits all"" approach, which does not reflect local levels of infection.
From Wednesday, more than 32 million people are due to be living under tier two restrictions, banning indoor meetings between households.
A further 23 million people would be placed under the highest - tier three - restrictions, which further limit contact between people outdoors.
Just over 1% of England's population would enter the lowest - tier one - restrictions, under which the ""rule of six"" applies both indoors and outdoors.
Conservative MP and former cabinet minister Damian Green, who represents Ashford, in Kent, which is set to go into tier three, told the BBC he would vote against the government unless it provided ""new and convincing evidence"".
""Instead of having these wide county-based areas, where people are put in tiers, then we should do it on a borough basis,"" he said.
""In an area like mine, the incidence is less than it is in Liverpool, which has just been released down into tier two. So, as it stands, the current policy, the current allocation of tiers on these wide bases, are just not evidence-based.""
Speaking on a visit to Public Health England laboratories, at Porton Down, Wiltshire, Mr Johnson said he understood the ""frustration"" of those in higher-tier areas, whose own town or village did not have high levels of the disease.
But he added that the government ""cannot divide the country up into loads and loads of very complicated sub-divisions"" and had to ensure ""some simplicity and clarity"".
""Unless you beat the problem in the high-incidence area, the low-incidence area, I'm afraid, starts to catch up,"" Mr Johnson said.
He said ""tough tiering"" was still more ""relaxed by a long way than the current lockdown measures"" and it would ""drive the disease down... until a vaccine comes on stream, which we hope will be over the next weeks and months"".
Asked about mass Covid testing, Mr Johnson said: ""The supply [of kits] I don't think is going to be the problem. The issue is going to be getting everybody mobilised to understand the potential advantage of [it].""
Aware of the disquiet on its own backbenches, the government has promised to publish impact assessments of the new restrictions; a key demand from concerned MPs.
There's also a suggestion that areas could move into lower tiers when numbers are reviewed at regular intervals.
But that's unlikely to see off the brewing Tory rebellion.
Some Conservatives have already publicly declared that they won't vote for the new tier system when it's put before the Commons next week.
If enough rebel the government might have to look to the opposition to get this through Parliament.
Sir Keir Starmer is still deciding whether his party will back the plan, although it is likely to have enough support overall.
However, it's not a good look for the government to have to rely on Labour in the face of unrest on its own benches.
The Covid Recovery Group of Conservative MPs, set up to scrutinise the government's response to the pandemic, is threatening a revolt in next Tuesday's vote.
The group's chair, Mark Harper, said evidence provided by the government to justify the tier system was not ""compelling"". He called for more information on the measures' effects on different sectors of the economy.
He added that on ""too many occasions, ministers have made arguments and they've not stacked up"".
Deputy chairman Steve Baker called the measures ""truly appalling"" and said the modelling used by government scientists had been ""wrong time and time again"".
The group claims to have 70 members, but it is not certain how many of them would be expected to rebel against the government.
Forty-three Conservatives would have to defy the prime minister to defeat the plan, if all opposition MPs also voted against.
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is expected to decide early next week whether to support Mr Johnson, after consulting government coronavirus experts.
Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said Labour was ""not against"" tougher restrictions or tiers, but would seek ""reassurances"" on support for the poor and vulnerable.
Under the government's plan, Kent and large parts of the Midlands, north-east and north-west England would go into tier three.
Only Cornwall, the Isles of Scilly and the Isle of Wight would be in tier one.
Mr Johnson said the government's planned ""review point"" - on 16 December - gave the ""prospect of areas being able to move down the tier scale"".
But Professor John Edmunds, a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said he could not imagine ""huge changes"" to restrictions by then.
He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that experts were unlikely to ""have accumulated much data"" in time.
The government has promised to publish an impact assessment before MPs vote on the new rules.

"Rhino die every day, so why is the world mourning the loss of Tam? Tam was the last male Sumatran rhinoceros in Malaysia and was thought to have died of old age in his thirties – elderly for a Sumatran rhino. He was taken from the wild in 2008 to a sanctuary in Malaysian Borneo. His health had been deteriorating since April 2019 and he finally succumbed in May. He is survived by a single female, Iman, who cannot reproduce due to a ruptured tumour in her uterus. The news isn’t good, but an estimated 80 individuals survive in the wilds of Indonesia – not a great number, but marginally better than the Javan rhino which may be as few as 58. By comparison, the African white rhino, which draws a great deal of concern, is thought to number 20,000. But populations of the Sumatran rhino – the world’s smallest and hairiest rhino – have declined 70% in the past two decades, mainly due to poaching and habitat loss, and are now classed as critically endangered – the highest possible risk of extinction.

      Africa's rhinos hog the limelight while their Asian cousins head for extinction


 The majority of the remaining Sumatran rhino are reckoned to be on Sumatra – the largest island of Indonesia – with a handful likely in the wild in Indonesian Borneo. For such a rare species with a scattered distribution that lives in dense mountain forests, evaluating the population size isn’t easy. Camera trapping is the main tool for counting this relatively diminutive and shy rhino, but even confidence in the estimate of 80 individuals isn’t high. There may be more but there are likely to be less – possibly as few as 30. On Sumatra, populations are thought to be isolated as their habitats have fragmented into smaller pockets due to deforestation. The result is inbreeding and means that genetically these sub-populations have a bleak future. They have been extinct in the wild in Malaysia since 2015. Captive Tam and Iman were already a lost cause at that point. With no possibility of reproduction, the Malaysian population of Sumatran rhino have been functionally extinct for many years. Low population sizes, few rhinos living close together and the isolation of viable habitats have combined with fatal consequences for the Sumatran rhino. If females don’t regularly mate, they have a tendency to develop uterine cysts and growths. It was this that left Iman infertile. This is what conservation biologists refer to as an “Allee effect”: the lower a population becomes, the less successful individuals become at reproducing. Ultimately, this leads to an extinction vortex. Tam’s death may yet encourage an ambitious plan to save the Sumatran rhino – with a concerted effort to capture as many of the remaining wild rhino as possible, and breed them in captivity. A young female called Pahu – whose forest habitat was literally being removed from under her feet by mining companies – was captured in 2018 and is apparently doing well in captivity. Sadly, there is a risk to this strategy. By removing rhino from their habitat, we further reduce the probability of them breeding successfully in the wild. As an ecologist, captive breeding is something that I find hard to celebrate. But it may be the only hope to save a species that, otherwise, appears doomed to slowly dwindle into extinction. That said, the breeding success of Sumatran rhino in captivity still isn’t assured. There has been some success in US zoos, but from 45 rhino captured since 1984, only four calves have been born. Even geopolitics deals this species a bad hand. Malaysia holds Iman and her eggs – the single surviving captive Sumatran rhino on the island of Borneo – and the sperm of recently deceased Tam. But the country must now collaborate with Indonesia, which holds seven rhino in captivity which have so far produced two offspring. The last throw of the dice may have to involve something akin to resurrection – using stored eggs and sperm from rhino, including Iman and Tam, for artifical insemination or IVF in captive surrogates of the same species. Sumatran rhinos are truly unique – they are the only member of their genus. With no related rhino species, the only surrogate candidate must be another Sumatran rhino. If successful, offspring could potentially come from otherwise lost genes, as has been suggested for the African white rhino.  While the science is developing, “de-extinction” is still an expensive and unlikely long shot that raises its own practical and ethical dilemmas. If successful, we could end up farming an ecologically dead species. I want wild animals to be in the wild contributing to the ecosystems within which they evolved – not living in zoos forever. Both modes of rescue – captive breeding and genetic resurrection – are too little, too late, like firefighters taking action when the damage is already too far gone. The longer that society waits to help a declining species, the greater the delay in addressing the driving forces of endangerment, be they poaching, habitat loss, non-native species, or climate change. And the lower the probability of success, and the greater the cost of the attempt. So, Tam was just one rhino. He was not the last of his species, or even the last male of his species, but he is one more loss from an already limited population. The lower the population size, the greater the impact of losing another individual. Tam is another alarm bell alerting us to our inability to act quickly enough to remove the threats to species, and ultimately to save life on Earth. Every dead Sumatran rhino is now met with publicity and concern. Rightly so, but we need to start getting the conservation action right early enough for it to work."

The last of the 2012 presidential debates is now in the history books; the German media react. Needless to say the German media are heavily biased towards Obama, and just Obama showing up is enough to declare him the winner.

And they all declared him the winner today. Yet, Germany’s mainstream media is filled throughout with disappointment. It’s obvious that Obama failed to get the result he badly needed.
What was once thought to be in the bag, is now needlessly up for grabs. Worse, Germany’s media sense the momentum is now behind Romney. They are nervous and filled with a growing sense of despair. Obama probably has blown what just a few weeks ago looked to be a shoe-in.
Tagesspiegel: The candidates switched roles – Romney looked like the president.
Obama went on the attack, Romney played the role of president. Calm, resolute and knowledgeable, Mitt Romney maneuvered Barack Obama into a role switch. The last TV debate hardly changed the dynamics of the campaign – Romney profits from this.”
Der Spiegel
Online Spiegel story is titled “Obama’s worthless victory” and writes that his “clear victory” in the third debate “will not move him ahead”. Spiegel observes:
Obama dominated – but Romney neutralized him. […] Mitt Romney in no way lost this foreign policy debate, which also greatly focused on economic policy; He is in a way the second winner.”

Die Welt
The online Die Welt carried the title: “Romney’s successful interview for Commander-in-Chief”. It writes:
The president was clearly stronger in the debate, he controlled the tempo and won on points. But the challenger was not knocked out in the test of strength with the Democrat, who had been able to gather stature as a statesman during his almost 4 years in office. Romney knew how to present himself as a moderate candidate for the White House…”.
and
Obama set the tone, but looked less strong when his challenger deviated from foreign policy and steered the debate into domestic policy and listed the negative economic data.”
Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ)
The FAZ makes the observation that Romney used the debate to distance himself from George W. Bush, and was not interested in taking on Obama.
On this evening, Romney was not looking to take on Obama, rather he was sort of shadow-boxing against another president: George W. Bush.”
Overall, the German media concludes Romney skillfully used the debate to maneuver to the center to collect the undecided votes, a tactic the media believe (and fear) he was successful at.
As far as climate change being a topic? Not once was Al Gore’s “greatest challenge for our species” mentioned in any of the 4 debates. Obviously it’s a very dead issue.

"**A further 10 residents have tested positive for Covid-19 at a care home where five people have previously died with the virus.**
Shinfield View Care Home in Berkshire said of the new cases, nine people had mild symptoms and one was asymptomatic.
Earlier this month, 49 staff members and 45 residents tested positive - including the five who died.
The others have now completed their isolation period, Berkley Care Group, which runs the home, said.
Residents affected completed a 14-day ""barrier nursing programme"" and are ""now deemed to be negative"", the group added.
They can now receive visitors in specially built on-site lodges.
All staff who initially tested positive, with the exception of two shielding members, isolated for 14 days and have since returned to work.
One resident has died of non-Covid related causes, while another remains seriously ill and is receiving palliative care.
Andrew Winstanley, chief executive of Berkley Care Group, said: ""Naturally, we shall continue our stringent testing regime and strict infection protocol.""
He added: ""We shall leave no stone unturned to ensure the care, safety and well-being of our residents.""
He also thanked residents and their families and friends for their ""kindness, compassion and great understanding"".
During the pandemic, 174 people have died in Wokingham after contracting the virus and 82 of those deaths occurred in care homes, according to the latest Office for National Statistics figures."
"The Amazon rainforest has been home to the Achuar people for thousands of years. Skilled hunters and fishermen, they have a spiritual connection with nature and consider themselves the forest’s greatest protectors. Life is governed by their ancestors, with family history passed down orally from generation to generation. Yet traditions are being undermined as the young are tempted away by modernity, while their fragile ecosystem faces man-made destruction.  But now, the same technological developments so often deemed a threat to traditional ways of life, have offered the Achuar people, and other remote tribal people, the opportunity to preserve their legacy and fight back against the eradication of their histories. A team from the global genealogy website MyHeritage has been spending time with groups like the Achuar in an attempt to preserve their family heritage. Entsakua Yunkar, shaman of the Achuar Sharamentsa community in Ecuador, said the project was helping to assuage his fears that “history can disappear” very quickly.  “I feel like the father of this community,” Yunkar said. “If I don’t exist here, this community can’t have power and be successful. I feel that I give positive energy to the communities and families here. “The big trees are my grandparents. They speak to me. I feel very sad when I think about what will happen in a long time. The world is changing. Our goal is to protect this area and our culture so it will be alive for many years.” The very existence of tribal communities around the world is threatened by a whole host of factors. Imported diseases, such as influenza, measles and chickenpox, can prove deadly when tribespeople have not had the chance to develop any immunity, according to Survival International, the global charity for tribal people’s rights. Deforestation and climate change are also huge threats, while technology and modernity risk destroying communities by luring younger members away to urban regions. The genealogy project is the brainchild of Golan Levi, a qualified architect who earlier in his career spent years creating giant sculptures with tribes around the world. “I heard fascinating stories [during his time as an architect],” he said. “They had a history of oral tradition, but they didn’t have a means to preserve their heritage. “The oral tradition keeps the essence of their communities but they’re losing the pieces. They might know the meaning behind a ceremony but they wouldn’t be able to tell you the name of their great great grandparents. “When I started working at MyHeritage I realised it was the perfect fit to document those stories.” The group’s first project was with the Himba people of Namibia in 2015, with subsequent delegations visiting the Nenets in Siberia, the Emberá, Ngäbe, Naso and Guna in Panama, and several tribes in Papua New Guinea. “Everything varies from tribe to tribe … but family and how they collaborate with each other is key,” said Levi. He explains the groups have initially been met with scepticism, but their willingness to muck in breaks down barriers with the tribespeople, who eventually agree to be photographed, filmed and interviewed. “It takes time to build trust,” he adds. “We live as they live in order to understand how they view the world and this is something they greatly appreciate.” Franklin Wasump, an Achuar who hails from the Wayusentsa community, echoed Entsakua Yunkar’s concerns about his culture disappearing. “In many years the Achuar culture may disappear, as happened with other nationalities, because there are many young people that don’t want to preserve the culture,” he said. “I am sad because although today it is still preserved, in the future it might not. “It is the responsibility of the father to teach, to talk to the young children in order not to lose the culture.” Yampia Santi, an Achuar leader from the Wayusentsa community, said he hoped the project would raise awareness. “The Achuar tribe will be around for many more generations, which is why we ask you tell your friends about the rainforest and the Achuar people who live there.”"
"**Some 842 British employers told government of plans to cut 20 or more jobs last month, as growing uncertainty about the pandemic and the government response hit business confidence.**
That's more than any month on record before the Covid outbreak began, and almost two-and-a-half times the level seen in October last year.
In total they are putting 51,000 jobs at risk, over double the 2019 number.
The data was released to the BBC after a Freedom of Information request.
Though high compared to normal years, the October figures are lower than the exceptional peaks caused by the pandemic in June, July and September.
October saw rapidly rising levels of Covid-19 infections, with restrictions introduced in many parts of the UK, culminating in an England-wide lockdown announced at the end of the month.
""These figures show us that many businesses were planning lots of job losses back in October because they were very worried and concerned about the evolving economic situation, and how that would unfold over the winter,"" said Rebecca McDonald, senior economist at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation think-tank.
Pret a Manger, the pub and brewing groups Greene King and Marston's, and Manchester Airport were among the employers to announce redundancy plans.
The government's job support measures evolved rapidly as the virus spread.
Businesses had expected the furlough scheme, which pays 80% of an employee's wages, to end on 31 October, with little certainty about what would replace it.
Reaching more than 9 million people at its peak, the scheme helped to prevent a much bigger surge in unemployment.
Fears about the end of furlough may help to explain the exceptionally high levels of redundancies seen in the summer.
On 24 September, the less generous Job Support Scheme was announced to replace furlough. It was expanded on 9 October, and expanded again on 22 October.
Then on 31 October, the day it was due to end, the furlough scheme was extended for a month. On 5 November it was extended again until the end of March.
""I think that the messy and last-minute approach that the chancellor took to his announcements in the autumn, especially about job support packages, will have contributed to the lack of certainty and unfortunately will have cost jobs,"" Ms McDonald said.
The government did not reply to a BBC request for comment.
The curtain never went up on the 16 March performance of Phantom of the Opera in London's West End.
Laurie Kirkby, head of sound on the show for ten years, came to work as usual at 5pm. That evening the Prime Minister announced the start of the lockdown, and the cast and crew were all sent home.
""That was the last day's work we did,"" he says. They were furloughed for a few months, but by the end of October everyone had been made redundant.
Theatre people know it can be an insecure job, but no-one was prepared for the entire live events industry to shut for months on end.
""I do lots of different things, but it's all in live events, so trying to diversify when you can't use any of your skills anywhere, is really difficult.
""It's hard to get work because there are so many people who are unemployed. So it has affected me greatly, as it has millions of other people.""
Laurie's wife, a dance teacher, has still been able to work, and her clients have been very supportive. So the family of four still has her income to rely on.
With no need for two cars, one has been sold. ""There won't be holidays, Christmas will be a little more economic.""
He's staying positive, doing some online courses and tackling the maintenance backlog that comes with living in an old house. But it's not easy.
""It affects your mental health because you forget what your career is, you forget what you used to do. I have not been in a theatre or done a live event since March now. It's a really strange feeling.
""You have to keep yourself focused, because if you think too hard about itâ¦ it can be damaging.""
Companies planning to make 20 or more redundancies have to notify the Insolvency Service at the start of the process, via an HR1 Advance Notice of Redundancy form.
The total number of planned redundancies will be higher than the figures compiled by the Insolvency service, as firms cutting fewer than 20 posts don't have to notify government.
However, employers often find ways to make fewer redundancies than they initially plan.
This data gives an early indication of how many firms are considering cutting staff, before the numbers from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) pick up any change.
For the period from July to September, ONS redundancy figures saw a record quarterly increase of 181,000 to reach a record high of 314,000.
This confirms the summer spike in redundancy plans detailed in previous BBC reporting.
Employers in Northern Ireland file HR1 forms with the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency, and they are not included in these figures.

The climate ’emergency’ nonsense got a fair old roasting last week. And rightly so. As **Karma** wondered, “Is there an ambulance big enough to fit the environment in?” But if the children declare it is an emergency, then it must be. Children always know best.



Our single use plastic PM is quoted as saying:



I don’t see why there should be any reason why members of Parliament wouldn’t want to demonstrate that this is a matter of urgency. 



Perhaps, just perhaps, there are members of parliament with a functioning brain?



 **deja vu** nailed it:



If Jacinda wants so badly to declare a climate ’emergency’ then she can lead by example. Move out of a house that is far too big for you, Jacinda, and take a small apartment. Cancel all your plans to travel overseas. Cut down on photo ops around the country. You can set up conferencing at the Beehive instead. To really show you mean business, cycle to work and ditch the ministerial car. Get your clothes from the op shop and cut out most of your ‘perks’ at the taxpayers’ expense. Best of all, cut your salary in half and start working full time like most taxpayers have to. WE are your employers – not the other way around. Oh, and examine yourself and take a large dose of humility. You haven’t earned your job – you were not elected, and you simply aren’t value for OUR money.



 **Sally** was there with a practical suggestion:



Ms Ardern how about stopping sending millions of dollars overseas which is wasted on this climate change dribble and do something constructive with it.  
Improve infrastructure so it can cope with various weather conditions.  
Build sea walls, stop banks, improve roads, strength bridges, look at the horticultural industry plant crops that suit drier conditions, make forestry more accountable. Stop virtue signalling to the world and do something more constructive at home.  
Get off those planes, no more conversations on the world stage. We are a dot at the end of the world, stop say you are going to save the world. Anyway if the world is coming to the end money and talk are not going to save it.   
Save your emergency for the next earthquake or volcanic eruption. They are are more likely going to kill us first.



 **Lindis** drew an germane comparison:



That’s what happens when you love your ideology more than you love your fellow countrymen . Trump loves his countrymen . Jacinda Ardern loves her ideology . Guess which country has happier people at the moment ? Answer: not ours .



 **Cadwallader** took us back to Christchurch and a real emergency:



What people faced in CHCH after the earthquakes was an “emergency!” To use the same label in the context of a supposed/possible contingency is not only a misuse of the word but a despicable insult to those who did suffer from wide-scale earthquake repercussions. Was Jacinda absent overseas during those terrible events…I am confident she may have been leading troubled youth to her imagined Marxist utopia? I detest the CoL.



 **xbolt** turned up the sarc volume on his keyboard:



I suppose that the provinces of Coromandel, Westland & Southland will have to secede from the Union Of Soviet Socialist Provinces Of New Zealand as they are refusing to declare a Climate Emergency and therefore have a dissenting view from Comrade Ardern’s Supreme Soviet Politburo. Embryonic Democracy in the Provinces. Who would have thought it possible in the Socialist/Communist Utopia that is New Zealand in 2019.



 **Davo42** agreed that there was a genuine emergency …



We have an emergency all right, but it is to do with the political climate. All I am thinking is how much is this going to cost me……

"In the world of climate finance, the December 2015 Paris Agreement was a high point. One of the key outcomes of the summit was a pledge to mobilise US$100 billion per year by 2020 in “new and additional” funds to help developing countries avoid, or at least adapt to, the worst effects of climate change. By signing the agreement, developed countries accepted the principle that they bear historical responsibility for global warming, and thus must take the lead in doing something about it. It is, therefore, welcome news that the Green Climate Fund (GCF), the main financial mechanism in UN climate policy, has attracted more pledges than any other fund in a short period of time, with US$10.3 billion pledged as of January 2019. That said, there is little indication that the US$100 billion pledge will be achieved, yet alone more ambiguous targets. The withdrawal of the US from the Paris Agreement has cast a long shadow over the developed world’s obligations to the developing world. Australia’s recent decision to stop its own contributions to the Green Climate Fund is the latest disappointment. Adding to these funding woes, the gap between what is needed and what is available grows deeper with each passing year. Post-Paris euphoria has since dissipated as it has become apparent that the pledged money will only cover a fraction of the true cost of tackling climate change. Mitigation alone will cost developing countries US$600 billion per year. The initial pledge in the Paris Agreement may only cover the US$60-US$100 billion per year needed for adaptation measures as proposed by the IPCC. And achieving this initial pledge is far from certain.  What is thus far missing from these financial instruments is climate justice – a consideration of the needs and well-being of the most vulnerable communities. Climate change will be particularly devastating for the poorest countries and communities, as the ability to adapt to factors like rising sea levels or droughts is closely related to developmental status.  In theory, the Green Climate Fund is targeted at exactly this problem. However, advanced economies have their own priorities, and these rarely align themselves with the intended purpose of climate finance or the developmental objectives of developing countries.  The Green Climate Fund requires countries seeking funding to provide substantial co-financing from their own tax base or the private sector to mitigate financial risk. What this means in practice is if a country like Bangladesh wants a million dollars to pay for cyclone shelters, it would also have to raise a similar amount from private investors and its own taxpayers. For the poorest countries, this is a significant barrier. This raises the question of whether the fund is really for those developing countries that are most vulnerable to climate change, or instead those countries with the most profitable investment opportunities. There is an absence of formal or clear criteria by which contributions to the Green Climate Fund must reach those who need it the most. It is no surprise, then, that world’s least developed countries have repeatedly been left behind. In 2015, they received just 30% of international public climate finance. One of us (Sennan) went through every single project approved by the Green Climate Fund, and found it also falls into this pattern – just 18% of funds went to projects in the poorest countries, while 65% went to projects in middle-income countries like Mexico or India.  These nations are preferred as they are better able to generate income and attract private investment. For instance, a state-owned geothermal developer in Indonesia was given a US$160m grant, the largest grant given to a single country by the GCF, to mitigate financial risk from developing geothermal projects. This project, co-financed by the World Bank with a US$325m loan, was made possible by Indonesia’s ability to generate income and attract co-financers as a middle-income country.   In contrast, Ethiopia, the third-poorest country in the world, struggled to gain approval for a US$45m grant to build resilience among its most vulnerable communities through measures such as improving basic access to food and water. The board of the Green Climate Fund initially did not agree to Ethiopia’s original proposal asking for a US$99.6m grant, citing lack of co-finance as one critical element. The proposal was eventually approved after the Ethiopian government put forward US$5m in co-finance and reduced the grant request by more than half.  The dilemma this poses for poorer nations is seen clearly in countries such as Ghana. To deliver on its commitments under the Paris Agreement, the West African country needs to mobilise nearly US$22.6 billion in investment over the next decade. The government is expected to request more than US$5 billion from the Green Climate Fund. It’s an overly ambitious request, and one that is also likely doomed to fail as Ghana’s rising public debts, weak institutions, lack of transparency and limited expertise in developing low-carbon investments means it will struggle to attract co-financers. But, of course, it is exactly these sorts of factors that mean countries like Ghana or Ethiopia are more vulnerable to climate change in the first place, compared to wealthier nations on similar latitudes like Indonesia or Costa Rica. In recognition of this dilemma, there needs to be a global effort to prioritise climate finance for those who need it the most and to ensure it actually helps developing countries to develop. It is, therefore, encouraging to see the International Development Committee at Westminster has embraced this view in its recently published report, UK Aid for Combating Climate Change. The report recommends explicitly adopting “climate justice” as a guiding principle to reform global climate financing structures and aid programmes. Without a fundamental change in the way we mobilise and deliver finance, the poorest and most vulnerable developing countries will continue to be left behind. The Centre for Climate Justice is hosting a forum on climate justice in June 2019. For more details, click here. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter.

![Media Name: stimulus-ad-2.jpg](/sites/cato.org/files/styles/pubs/public/wp-content/uploads/stimulus-ad-2.jpg?itok=K5LgH2Qi)



**Cato Leads Opposition to Fiscal Stimulus**   
  
In reaction to statements from Obama administration officials who say “all economists agree” that the only way to fight the economic recession is to go on a massive government spending spree, the Cato Institute took out a full page ad in the nation’s largest newspapers that showed that those words were not true. Signed by more than 200 economists, including Nobel laureates and other highly respected scholars, the statement was published this week in _The New York Times_ , _The Washington Post_ and many other publications.   
  
On the day the ad ran in _The New York Times_ , Cato executive vice president David Boaz added more names to the list of economists who are skeptical of the spending bill.   
  
Commenting on the principles behind the stimulus, Cato adjunct scholar Lawrence H. White and fellow economist David C. Rose discuss why we can’t spend our way out of this mess: 



You can't solve an excessive spending problem by spending more. We are making the crisis worse.



In _The Wall Street Journal_ , Cato senior fellow Alan Reynolds examines the numbers and discovers that each government job created will cost taxpayers a staggering $646,214 per hire.   




The stimulus package now moving through Congress will spend nearly $1 trillion that the government does not have. With the nation already $1.2 trillion in the hole, Cato director of Tax Policy Studies Chris Edwards discusses the sheer illogic behind pushing for stimulus at a time like this: 



If I get up in the morning and drink five cups of coffee and that doesn’t stimulate me, I don’t go and drink another five. I’d recognize my addiction problem and start reforming my bad habits. Federal policymakers should do the same.



For more on the stimulus plan, read Edwards’s Tax and Budget Bulletin, “The Troubling Return of Keynes,” (PDF) co-authored by Ike Brannon, former senior adviser to the U.S. Treasury.   
  
During the House vote on the stimulus bill, just 11 Democrats voted against it, leaving Boaz to ask, “What Happened to the Blue Dog Democrats?”   
  
“Blue Dogs supported fiscal responsibility at some vague point in the misty past, and they will strongly support fiscal responsibility at some vague point in the future,” writes Boaz. “But right now they’re going to vote to put their constituents another $825 billion in debt.”   
  
**Obama Promises to Close Guantanamo Bay Detention Center**   
  
Cato legal policy analyst David H. Rittgers explains why he approves of Obama’s choice to shut down the prison at Guantanamo Bay and offers advice on how to proceed with the plan: 



The Founders wrote the Bill of Rights after a violent insurgency brought on by government oppression, and the principles contained therein are no weaker while countering today's terrorists. Using national security courts to try the detainees in Guantanamo opens the door to closed and classified trials of domestic terror suspects. This degradation of essential liberties is unwise and avoids the social function of trials.



Listen to a Cato Daily Podcast interview with Rittgers to learn more about the future of the Gitmo detainees.   
  
In the forthcoming _Cato Handbook for Policymakers_ , Timothy Lynch, director of Cato’s Project on Criminal Justice, lays out a plan for the future of our government’s strategy for dealing with terrorism. (PDF)   
  
**Gore Global Warming Hearing Goes on Despite Snowstorm**   
  
Undeterred by a snowstorm that shut down schools and gave federal workers “liberal leave,” the Senate Foreign Relations Committee held a hearing on global warming this week with star witness Al Gore. Gore promoted ways to end climate change through cap-and-trade legislation and investment in renewable energy, reported _U.S. News and World Report._   
  
In a Cato Policy Analysis, author Indur Goklany offers his commentary on how government should handle climate change.   
  
Cato senior fellow in environmental studies Patrick J. Michaels offers his analysis on climate change, and how the international community should react.   
  
Appearing on Fox News, Michaels, who is a former Virginia state climatologist, asserts that when it comes to climate change, there is no immediate emergency. For more, don’t miss Michaels’s new book, _Climate of Extremes: Global Warming Science They Don’t Want You to Know_, co-authored with Robert C. Balling Jr.

Matthew Hooton nails it once again.



For those still committed to reality-based politics, Ardern’s “year of delivery” is as credible as her earlier promise to be “transformational”.  
KiwiBuild, the Billion Trees programme and the Provincial Growth Fund handing out only 3 per cent of the money Shane Jones has paraded are the most risible.  
More seriously, Ardern appointed herself Minister for Child Poverty Reduction and declared it the reason she entered politics, yet by some measures it has worsened. 



Beneficiary numbers and state-house waiting lists are up, with just 656 new state houses completed in 2018/19, compared with 1043, 466 and 732 over the previous three years.  
The promise to deliver a Wellbeing Budget based on the Treasury’s Living Standards Framework turned out to be a hoax, with Grant Robertson putting his Budget together in exactly the same way as his predecessors. His decision to increase the Government’s debt limit by $16 billion suggests Steven Joyce was right, pre-election, to talk about a $12b fiscal hole. 



That is a stunning list of non delivered items, don’t you think?



Immigration from countries other than Australia is as high as ever, still above 100,000 a year, a massive number for a country of just 5 million people with already failing infrastructure.  
At least in Auckland, there is no bold programme to address that infrastructure deficit, with vast bureaucratic effort going into analysing vanity projects like the airport tram rather than radically expanding the existing rail system and optimising the roading network. 



On climate change — which Ardern called her generation’s “nuclear-free moment” — spin continues to trump substance, with agriculture potentially going into the Emissions Trading Scheme but with 95 per cent subsidies. Who knew Ardern’s climate “emergency” could be solved by dairy farmers paying just 1c per kilogram of milk solids?  
As yet, no decisions have been made on reforming water allocation rights and cleaning up lakes and rivers. Plans for a water tax have gone the same way as Michael Cullen’s capital gains tax. 



Well, for once, I am glad about something this government has done… or technically not done, as it looked like they were was going to trash our economy completely by strangling the agricultural sector. Now it might take them 2 terms to wreck the economy instead of just one.



In contrast to Chris Finlayson’s cracking pace, Andrew Little has signed just three Treaty of Waitangi deeds of settlement and made no progress with Ngapuhi. No human remains will ever be recovered from Pike River, whatever Little tells the families. 



This was always a lie of outrageous proportions, with the Pike River families being used as political footballs all the way through the ordeal. The West Coast gets what it deserves though… these guys always, always vote Labour.



**On ethical issues such as complying with the Official Information Act, answering parliamentary questions and managing conflicts of interest, the Ardern ministry has complied with the maxim that each Government is worse than the one before.**



No, Matthew, they are the most open and transparent government of all time… and also the most skillful with a black felt pen… 



Ardern may cultivate a brand of almost naive sincerity but those around her are at least as cynical as those around John Key.  
They know it will be enough for Ardern to take to social media to declare the year of delivery a triumph and to thank New Zealanders for making it happen. “The Government didn’t do this alone!” the Prime Minister will gush. “We all did this together!”  
 **It will be amplified by those in the traditional media for whom challenging Ardern’s narrative remains verboten. Those who break the taboo will be criticised for not embracing the vibe. Such negativity, her cheerleaders will tell us, is not who we are now.**



For those who criticise National and their inability to tear the government to shreds, the next paragraph gives us an inkling into how tough it can be.



In the post-truth era, the Opposition pointing out the sheer emptiness of the Prime Minister’s utterances will achieve no more than the Washington Post frantically fact-checking Trump’s. **If Simon Bridges challenges the Prime Minister’s account, he will be ridiculed for looking angry.**





That is happening already, with National being accused of heresy for questioning the value of declaring ‘climate emergencies’. These guys cannot win in the current environment.



Good on Matthew Hooton for calling out the government’s woeful performance to date, but he is a lone voice. Over on _Stuff_ , on the same day, we have the inevitable puff piece from Tracy Watkins…



Baby [Neve Te Aroha Gayford](https://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/parenting/113674411/its-neve-te-aroha-ardern-gayfords-first-birthday) is crawling around the floor of her parents’ Sandringham bungalow when she discovers the big fluffy microphone in our video operator’s bag. She grabs it before her famous mum can stop her and starts making “woof woof” noises.  




“There are obvious limitations to what I’m able to do as a first time mum. And that’s something that actually I just had to accept. There’s no point dwelling on that too much.”  
The limitations Ardern refers to are “just not being around” for Neve as much as she would like.  
“Some days I’ll only see Neve once (a day). Sometimes I won’t see her at all. Sometimes I won’t see her for a couple of days. 



  
Personally, I am sick to death of a sycophantic media trying to keep the worst-performing prime minister in living memory in her job by constantly writing these pathetic articles to bolster her public appeal. 



Doesn’t it strike you as worrying that, apart from Matthew Hooton, the rest of the media doesn’t even try to defend the prime minster’s dreadful job performance, but concentrates solely on the fact that she is a first-time mother instead? 



What does that tell you about the quality of our government?

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt their blogsite here climatologist (IPCC author) Professor Hans von Storch and cultural scientist Werner Krauss have announced they’ve authored a new book on the topic of climate change, society and policy:

“The Climate Trap – The dangerous proximity of politics and climate science” – Hanser Verlag
The book will be released later this month by Munich publisher Hanser Verlag. A longer excerpt for reading is available here in German.
This is neither a skeptic nor an alarmist book. In it von Storch and Krauss have plenty of harsh criticism for both sides of the debate, and then some. Both sides, they claim, are responsible for having driven the climate issue into the ground. The book, they say, explains how climate science got there in the first place, and what possibilities are left to get climate sciences back on track so that it can produce productive action.
Here are some excerpts of the publisher’s excerpt:
On the state of climate change today, von Storch and Krauss write (my emphasis):

After the unprecedented success story of climate change becoming an object of public attention and concern, climate policy and the accompanying climate debate have wound up in a dead end. Despite the Kyoto Protocol and other agreements, commitments to transform the energy supply, and all the climate summits, there’s been no noteworthy success. To the contrary: The curve depicting global emissions of greenhouse gases has been surging upwards. In the summer of 2012, at the summit Rio +20, katzenjammer was everywhere.”

On the climate debate:

Together with climate politics, the climate sciences have ended up in a credibility crisis. The often-made commitment of limiting the temperature increase to 2°C is scientifically controversial and practically impossible politically. The debate is also being paralyzed by a raging public dispute between alarmists and skeptics. […]
The climate debate is stuck in the mud, the credibility of climate scientists has been cast into doubt, and the policymakers’ ability to act on the issue of climate is minimal. We are sitting in the climate trap.”

Why are we in this trap? Von Storch and Krauss write:

It’s not only incompetent politics, the exaggerations by the media and climate protectors, or the destructive forces of the skeptics that are responsible for the interim failure of climate policy. More responsible is the fact that we failed to understand the problem in its full dimension.”

The authors reveal how they feel about alarmist scientists. Since the early 2000s they felt “something was amiss”.

Was the climate apocalypse really at our doorstep as we could read in the media? Or were they exaggerating in their depiction of the results coming from climate science? […]
The climate scientist [von Storch] had the suspicion that climate science was dragging around a ‘cultural rucksack’ that was influencing the interpretation of the data. The cultural scientist [Krauss], with regards to the appearances by some climate scientists in the media and the roles they were readily assigned, was reminded of weather-wizards and shamans of foreign cultures.”

In the book, the authors even describe climate science as a ‘tribe of scientists’ and how some began behaving like prophets:

Some climate scientists were regular interview-partners and talkshow guests – and thus self-confidence became bigger, to the point that they knew the truth about climate change and thus became convinced that policy-making and society should follow the deeper insight of science.”
Without really being aware of it, climate scientists had taken over the role of prophets: They predicted the imminent end-of-the-world if society did not fundamentally change soon, reduced its emissions, and behaved more sustainably with the environment. The problem was not only the message, but also that they were were often completely way in over their heads with the role as mediator between nature and society.”

These “prophets” put out a story that was too much to handle. Von Storch and Krauss write:

Science delivered the raw material for a big climate narrative, one that still continues to shape our perception and media depiction of climate change today. It unleashed the horror scenarios of the Cold War and the fear of the atom, conveying them into the 21st century. A narrative seeded in the world by climate scientists, and one that keeps going out of their control again and again.”

The authors tell us that the way out of the “climate trap” is to begin by “viewing climate change as an issue that does not hang over us like ominous writing on the wall, but as one that has an appropriate place in our societies.” Krauss and von Storch are telling us: “Cool it!” They propose a third, alternative way.
If the rest of the book is like the beginning, then it will have the potential to change the direction of the climate discussion in Germany for the better. It’ll be near the top of my birthday wishlist.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhat follows to me is absolutely stunning. I don’t recall the US government officials and military persons responsible for dropping the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki being brought to trials in Nuremberg. Controversial? Maybe for some. But to put Hiroshima on the same level as Auschwitz?

Excerpt from the PIK press release.
Hat/tip a reader.
Obviously Schellnhuber knows no scruples when it comes to promoting his alarmist brand of climate science.
Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber, Director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, is the direct personal advisor to Chancellor Angela Merkel on the “urgent” climate issue. This is a slap to the face of the allied forces who sacrificed so much to liberate the world from the horrible tyranny of the time.

Surely it cannot be the position of the German government to have itself advised by persons with such beliefs.
Some years ago, the brown neo-Nazis in the Saxony Parliament called the bombing of Dresden near the end of WWII a “Bomben-Holocaust“, to which there rightfully was a swift and harsh reaction from politicians, media and citizens.
Schellnhuber’s Hiroshima-Auschwitz press release is no better and deserves the same reaction.
Welcome to the real face of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.
The online Potsdam PNN here/ has the original quote from Schellnhuber (h/t Bernd Felsche):
Conscience, Schellnhuber says with regards to the unanswered questions concerning climate science, does not need absolute certainty: ‘In a world where Hiroshima and Auschwitz happened, I can’t trust that everything will always turn out well.'”

==========================================
What Should We Do About CO2 Emissions?
By Ed Caryl
So, what should we do about CO2 emissions? The answer is: nothing. The evidence that Co2 is harmful, that it is raising the earth’s temperature dramatically, has been largely fabricated, and at the least, overblown. Surprisingly, when all the facts are in, CO2 is beneficial! It is an essential trace gas, and a fertilizer. The current increase has boosted growth rates of vegetation worldwide by 13 to 15% (see here).
CO2 is used as a supplement in greenhouses. In a closed greenhouse, growth slows or stops if the plants use it up and CO2 drops below 200 ppm as the plants absorb it. CO2 supplement systems are sold to greenhouse farmers to supply supplemental CO2. Levels up to 1000 ppm or more are often used (see here). Extra CO2 also reduces a plant’s need for water by closing the leaf stomata (see here). Leaf stomata are the ports on the lower side of a leaf that lets plants breath.
One of the most important crops in the world is rice. Studies have been done on Co2 enhancing rice production. If CO2 is increased 200 ppm above the current levels, (which have already increased production by the 13 to 15% cited above) production will increase by another 13 to 15% (see here and here).
Here is an illustration of growth over a range of CO2 levels:

Rice and a wild grass that is the antecedent of Foxtail Millet. Source: Susanne von Caemmerer, W. Paul Quick, and Robert T. Furbank (2012). The Development of C4 Rice: Current Progress and Future Challenges. Science 336 (6089): 1671-1672.
C3 and C4 refers to the chemical pathway used by the chlorophyll in plant leaves to produce sugar. C4 plants include many grasses and corn. It has been argued that C4 plants are immune to changes in CO2, but as you can see in the illustration above, this is clearly not true. They just don’t respond as dramatically as C3 plants. They do, however, become more drought tolerant due to the stomata response reducing water vapor loss.
Plants need 3 major inputs to grow: water, CO2, and nitrogen. From these they produce sugar for energy and proteins and cellulose for structure. Some have argued that increased CO2 produces protein-poor plants. This is true only if increased nitrogen is not supplied along with the increased CO2. A plant needs both in balance. Any greenhouse farmer knows this. But still, this increased growth with increasing CO2 assumes no improvement from fertilization, genetic engineering or plant breeding.
The experiments have been done holding all factors except CO2 constant. That increase from CO2 alone is about 100 million metric tons for each 15% increase in yield per year. That feeds about 700 million more people if one assumes 150 kg of rice per person per year. Imagine the gain if additional fertilizer was supplied along with the increase in CO2. Wheat production with double the current levels of CO2 increased by up to 38 percent (see here). Corn responds to elevated CO2 by needing less water (see here). It is clear that CO2 increases will greatly improve our ability to feed a growing world population.
If we try to limit CO2, we will dramatically limit the economic growth of the world with no effect on the climate. This is already happening in Europe. Taxing CO2 in efforts to limit production of it only makes money for the Al Gore’s of the world. It limits our use of the energy we need for economic growth and the CO2 that our crops need to flourish. Limiting CO2, even if we could, would literally mean the starvation of a billion people in the next 50 years.
What is more important? Feeding and lifting most of the world from poverty orr preventing a questionable slight temperature rise which would lengthen the growing season? The Global Warming crowd is trying to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.

By **Owen Jennings**



Alarm bells are sounding. Not loudly, yet, but persistently and with growing clangour. 



In another apt analogy, the storm clouds are gathering and the first peals of thunder can be heard. Our economy is heading toward danger and those in charge are oblivious to the problem but, even worse, do not have a clue on how to handle the deteriorating situation. There was more negativity Tuesday night on the state of the economy as the business community showed its despair at the Coalition’s direction or lack thereof.



 **The massive issue facing the Coalition is that it is faction-ridden**. The factions are irreconcilable. In the middle is Grant Robertson, desperately trying to steady the ship knowing he has to try and deliver stability and surpluses. On one hand, he has crazed greenies to deal with, hell-bent on achieving environmental goals whatever the cost – even watching the economy collapse if need be.



On another side he has a group of big spenders, focused on buying popularity and wandering around like drunken sailors squandering hard-earned, taxpayer’s money but, ignorant of its effect on the nation’s accounts, or simply too intoxicated with the adulation from the province’s wannabees to notice.



Another group led by the PM. The articulate and plausible, who have an inflated sense of their own international worth, determined to be crowned as savers of the planet and setters of new global trends with wellbeing budgets and rescuing of the homeless. 



Yet another faction sees money as the answer for all Maori problems. These won’t be content until they have created a dual and fractionated society by throwing endless dollars at each and every existing social problem despite how useless handouts are at rectifying such issues as history has repeatedly shown.



You can visualise the cartoon… Ringmaster Robertson trying to orchestrate wild factions of clowns, inexperienced, naive, arrogant and consumed, each with their narrow agenda ripping down and collapsing the Big Top.



The common denominator for each faction is runaway spending in the hands of maladroit novices.



Even those voters who backed them hoping for the bright new face of “kind government” are sick of waiting for a “transformation”. It was always just words, virtue signalling and dangerous ideology.



The alarm bells include **a rapidly diminishing surplus.** Spending rises by the day. The calculations of surpluses were too generous. Economists are doing the numbers and they are groaning. Stephen Joyce’s knowing smile grows wider by the week.



 **Business confidence is falling.** It is not just sudden “captain’s calls” lacking integrity, research and economic rationale. There are nervous twitches in the world’s major economies; trade talks are foundering, there is uncertainty around Brexit, around the USA/China wars, around falling per capita incomes and much more. All this is confirmed by the rising price of gold.



 **Nervousness in the market is contagious.** Investment decisions get cancelled or postponed. Two or three big co-ops in dairy and meat have failed to deliver and the Chinese have swooped in, eager to create plough-to-plate options on their own terms.



 **No major roadworks are planned.** The Coalition cancelled the most beneficial of these. Hanging wire ropes down the centre of the road doesn’t create many jobs and leaves the underlying problem unsolved. Currently, roadworks are being spun out as long as possible to keep the machinery running. Unemployment looks set to rise in that sector.



 **Housing is a mess** – a mess directly attributable to Coalition incompetence. Developers cringe at the thought of even more incompetence being propelled into the cauldron. The irony is that much of what was a housing crisis is now correcting itself. The Coalition is like a fireman riding a bike to a fire. Voilà, it’s all over before they get there. 



But **the blackest cloud is energy price rises** and the havoc that the Emissions Bill will create in an already vulnerable market. The obsession with climate change, despite New Zealand being the lone, chaste participant, shows we have a leadership more committed to showing off than to reality, willing to cripple our economy so we can beat our chest in the international arena.



Meanwhile, evidence for catastrophic outcomes is non-existent. It is taking us into shark-infested waters that will crash employment, disembowel farming and send energy prices through the roof. 



**Energy prices impact all other prices.** It will take decades to repair. Deliberately pillaging the economy, knowingly setting out a planned rape of what have been well performed, national accounts and doing so alone, internationally, when we are so small and exposed, is political treachery.



Were there some tangible reward for such harm, there might be an excuse, but doing it all for saving an indiscernible 0.2 of one degree C is utter madness. 



The current skirmishing around the banks, including the Reserve Bank lashing out, is much more than a debate over reserves set aside for a rainy day. That’s a blind, a side-play. It is dawning on those in shiny suits in Queen Street that the utterly absurd outcomes proposed under the Emissions Bill and related environmental rules, are going to decimate their bank’s balance sheets. Inflation from escalating energy costs will crash through the economy like a raging tornado, inflating the price of all goods and services, thereby awakening the sleeping inflation giant and sending interest rates skyrocketing. You can smell the fear. 



The constant harping and exaggeration about dirty dairying, about overstocking and methane emissions, has been all about conditioning us for a removal of up to half our farms and replacing them with trees. The effects in rural New Zealand will be calamitous for our farming families. Trees produce no income for 25 years, leaving the rural community bereft of jobs and activity. When they are harvested they can cause an environmental disaster like the one we saw on the East Coast a few months ago. Falling log prices in the last few days may alter the numbers around the edges but several farms are changing hands every day – all are being prepared for tree planting. 



The lack of understanding, of any semblance of careful planning, evaluation and strategic inputs is alarming. Is the inner Cabinet plain stupid or is it hopelessly naive; like expecting a froth and bubble history academic to tackle New Zealand’s major housing problem? The Health Minister is a possum caught in the lights and oversees a sector desperate for leadership and a firm knowledgeable hand.



 **Education is run by the unions using Hipkins as their glove puppet.** Green ministers slash and burn progress with no robust analysis, no warning, no rationale. Only Shane Jones knows what he is doing – the first politician to tax and spend his way to wealth and re-election happiness. 



By October or November, the storm will wreak damage. Decisions made by ‘feel’ not fact will become glaringly obvious as failures. Missed targets will continue. Commission and committee reports will start to fester as incompetent Ministers try to figure out their execution. The year of delivery will be no more than a fake pregnancy. It will be an unhappy Christmas.



Winning the RWC might stave off the day of reckoning. Losing it will bring the final curtain down.

"**Hospitals in England could become ""overwhelmed"" with Covid cases if MPs do not back new restrictions, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove has said.**
Many Tory MPs oppose the tougher tier system, which begins on 2 December.
But writing in the Times, Mr Gove said MPs - who will vote on the measures next week - need to ""take responsibility for difficult decisions"".
Labour is yet to decide whether it will support the new restrictions.
It has warned, however, that areas in tier three will be stretched to ""breaking point"" without further financial support from the Treasury.
It comes as a further 479 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported in the UK, bringing the total to 58,030. There were also a further 15,871 positive cases registered in the past 24 hours.
When England's four-week national lockdown ends on Wednesday, regions will be placed in one of three tiers: medium, high and very high.
In total, 99% of England will enter the highest two tiers, with tight restrictions on bars and restaurants and a ban on households mixing indoors. Only Cornwall, the Isle of Wight and Isles of Scilly will be in the lowest tier.
Some MPs say the new system imposes tight restrictions on numerous areas with low cases, and are calling instead for a more localised approach.
But Mr Gove has defended the new system, saying that, unless action to slow the spread of coronavirus is taken, the NHS could be ""broken"" and hospitals ""physically overwhelmed"".
""The tiers we had in place before the lockdown had not suppressed [Covid] sufficiently: they were neither strong enough to reduce social contact sufficiently, nor applied widely enough to contain the virus's spread,"" he wrote.
He added that, across the UK, about 16,000 beds are filled with Covid-19 patients, compared to a peak in April of almost 20,000 and a low of 740 on 11 September.
""When the country is facing such a national crisis, the truth is that all of us who have been elected to Parliament, not just ministers, must take responsibility for difficult decisions,"" he said.
Elsewhere in the UK, Northern Ireland has begun a two-week circuit-breaker lockdown, while in Scotland each area has been placed in one of five tiers.
In Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford said pubs, restaurants and bars will be subject to stricter restrictions \- which are not yet finalised - in the run up to Christmas. They will come into force from Friday, 4 December.
Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith is among those questioning England's approach.
On Friday, he asked ""what was the point of lockdown"" if England ends up with tighter restrictions than it had before the four-week national restrictions came into force.
Several Conservative MPs have asked to see the data the government based its decision on.
Tory MP Tobias Ellwood told the BBC's Newsnight programme: ""Here in Dorset, we entered lockdown with pretty low figures. We're coming out of it with even lower figures.
""This last week we've gone down by a third. So we're really surprised to find ourselves in tier two.""
Conservative MP Craig Mackinlay, who represents South Thanet, which has the second highest rate of infection in the UK, said he will vote against the new ""draconian"" tiered restrictions.
He told BBC Breakfast: ""I think once areas see themselves going in the wrong direction, that actually has a very, very distinct affect on people's behaviour.""
""They almost self-regulate, they actually do take those space, hands, and all of those good things far more seriously.""
But epidemiologist Prof Neil Ferguson, whose advice led to the decision to go into the first lockdown, told Today: ""I know people argue: 'well why are we going into more intensive measures now after lockdown than we were before?'
""And it's because we don't want to repeat the same mistakes made before this current lockdown and allow cases to rise exponentially again coming into Christmas - particularly in the context that we are going to have a relaxation over Christmas, which does pose some risks.""
NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson told BBC Breakfast those who run hospitals are ""worried about the fact that if those rules are too loose and if people go beyond them"" that ""could trigger a third phase"".
He said the MPs making policy decisions are ""not epidemiologists, they're not experts about exactly what is the balance between loosening the restrictions and what might then follow - that's for the scientific experts, the epidemiologists"".
""The real problem is January is always the NHS' busiest time of year and therefore it is really important that people not only observe the rules,"" he said.
On staffing in hospitals, he said it only takes a ""very, very small amount of sickness in particular areas"" among health workers to result in a ""pretty major problem"".
""If you have a single anaesthetist who is off, then that means 15, 20 other people who are meant to be doing an operation for somebody - that affects their work,"" he said.
The new coronavirus tier restrictions will mean 55 million people will be banned from mixing with other households indoors.
The tiers areas are in will be reviewed every 14 days, starting 16 December.
Differences between the new tiers include restrictions on where households can meet up:
Gyms and close-contact beauty services like hairdressers will be able to open in all tiers. People in all tiers who can work from home, should continue to do so.
Pubs in tier two can only open to serve ""substantial meals"", while those in tier three can only operate as a takeaway or delivery service.
Meanwhile, Labour's shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds will urge Chancellor Rishi Sunak to extend the Additional Restrictions Grant (ARG) in tier three areas following concerns the new rules will force some local authorities to stretch the grants further than others.
Leaders in Lancashire have written to the PM's interim chief of staff saying it is ""unfair"" that areas facing four weeks of restrictions under the lockdown received the same amount as they did for seven weeks.
The one-off ARG funding equates to Â£20 per person in an area and is designed to help closed businesses that do not directly pay business rates, as well as those that do not have to close but are affected by restrictions.
Ms Dodds is due to tell the party's online regional conference - Connected North West - on Saturday afternoon: ""It is completely irresponsible for the government to leave tier three areas in the lurch like this again.""
A Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy spokesman said ""a host of other support measures"" have been made available."

Share this...FacebookTwitterNow that the preliminary draft of the IPCC Assessment Report 5 (AR 5) is available online, thanks to Alec Rawls, readers have had the chance to analyze it in detail.
Michael Krüger at Readers Edition here takes a look at some of the charts and graphics for temperature and sea level rise development, and compares the IPCC charts to those from alarmist Stefan Rahmstorf.
As Krüger shows, scientists have very different perspectives and everything but consensus exists:
IPCC Draft vs Rahmstorf’s Manipulations
Stefan Rahmstorf, one of the most well-known and influential climate scientists in Germany, and a lead author for the last IPCC report, announced at his KlimaLounge blog in 2008 that the temperature development at the time was at the upper limit of those of the IPCC scenarios:

Chart from Stefan Rahmstorf: Global annual mean temperatures using datasets from NASA (red) and the Hadley Center (blue) through 2007. The heavy line is the 11-year smoothing. The gray area with the dashed lines beginning in 1990 depicts the range of the IPCC scenarios. Here the temperature development is at the upper range of the IPCC scenarios.
But much to our astonishment, the recent draft of the IPCC AR 5 contains a completely different graphic. In this chart the temperature development is not in the upper range of the scenarios, rather it is barely at the very lower range of the IPCC scenarios:

Temperature development depicted in the draft of the coming IPCC AR5. The range of the scenarios for the four previous IPCC reports are shown along with the observed temperature development, which is depicted by black dots (with error bars). It is clear to see that the current temperature development lies in the lower range of the IPCC scenarios and that the temperature increase has not accelerated over the last years.
The same is true with sea level rise. Stefan Rahmstorf announced at his KlimaLounge blog in 2011 that sea level rise had accelerated and that it was in the far upper range of the IPCC scenarios:
Figure from Stefan Rahmstorf: Global sea level relative to 1990 in tide gauge data (red) and satellite data (blue), compared to the scenarios of the IPCC (gray area and dished lines).
But now take a look at the observed data and scenarios shown in the draft of the upcoming IPCC AR 5. It shows the opposite is true:

Sea level development depicted in the draft of the upcoming IPCC AR 5: The overall range of the four previous IPCC reports is shown along with the actual observed sea level plot (shown by the black dots with error bars). Clearly the current sea level rise has not accelerated and is in the lower range of the IPCC scenarios.
Summary: These examples show that data can be bent one way or the other. Some climate scientists, such as Mr. Rahmstorf, intentionally use such methods in order to suggest to the readers that we are actually in the middle of a crisis. And the climate protection allegiance is ready and willing to believe it. I believe the charts in the draft of the IPCC AR 5, which did not succumb to alarmism.
By the way, within climate protection circles, the new graphics of the IPCC are already being discredited as the works of skeptics. It’ll be interesting to see what changes will be made in the final draft of the IPCC report.”
I expect to see both graphics disappear entirely.

"What a difference a year makes. This time in 2018 the long hot summer was weeks away. Saddleworth Moor was not yet on fire. Greta Thunberg’s climate strike had not begun, let alone brought millions onto the streets. The IPCC’s 1.5 degree report had not been released (and most thought it would sink without trace). Extinction Rebellion was unheard of outside a tiny group of committed environmentalists. And now look where we are. Local authorities across the UK are declaring climate emergencies (the latest is Birmingham). The UK parliament declared a climate emergency in April, and now, prime minister Theresa May, in legacy mode, has declared that the country will have net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. That means for every gram of greenhouse gas emitted – mostly from burning fossil fuels – an equivalent amount must be removed from the atmosphere, via speculative technologies such as “Bio-Energy Carbon Capture and Storage” or Direct Air Capture. To do this, May has ignored the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s warning that a 2050 target could cost £1 trillion (the two don’t get on). But what does it all mean, and what is to be done? As always, it pays to read the fine print. A month ago, the Committee on Climate Change released a major report on when the UK could reach a zero-carbon target, and recommended a target of 2050. My colleague Joe Blakey and I argued that the report was simply not ambitious enough, was silent on consumption-based emissions accounting and only includes international aviation and maritime emissions from 2033.  Most of all, a 2050 target completely disregards the UK’s historical emissions responsibility – in the Global South the damage is already being felt. (The short version – it’s much less risky for ourselves, future generations and other species if we miss a really ambitious target by a couple of years than reach an unambitious one “safely”.) The government’s announcement will essentially enshrine the report’s 2050 target recommendation in law. Yet May’s declaration still has loopholes – for instance, as Greenpeace has noted, it allows the use of international carbon credits which will “shift the burden to developing nations”. Meanwhile, expanding Heathrow (or any airport) sends exactly the wrong signal about the kinds of changes which will be needed. Business as usual is simply not an option. Even electric airplanes, if they emerge, will make only a very minor dent in Heathrow’s emissions which are largely from long-haul flights, beyond the scope of putative electric aircraft. If the UK were serious it would now abandon fracking, which according to respected academics is not compatible with the UK’s climate targets. Even Lord Browne, ex-head of BP and more recently chair of the fracking company Cuadrilla, recently conceded “fracking in the UK doesn’t make much sense”. “Traditional” fossil fuel extraction also really has to end soon: Greenpeace activists are right now trying to stop a BP oil rig bound for the North Sea. We’ve had over 30 years of warm words about climate change, all the way back to Margaret Thatcher addressing the Royal Society in September 1988. If warm words prevented global warming, I wouldn’t be writing this article. So, if we want a different outcome, we need different actions. Business people are going to have to actually do that thing – innovation – that they keep talking about. Innovation in how we eat, how we heat houses, move people, and so on. Politicians should also be telling the truth. Here in Manchester, where I am based, a recent Freedom of Information Act request showed that the city’s leaders have been remarkably silent on climate change over the past two years. Mostly, though, concerned citizens have to realise that fixing climate change is a process, not a series of events (what I call an emotacycle). If they want the bold pronouncements of 2019 to mean something through the 2020s and beyond, they need to start engaging with the nitty gritty of political scrutiny structures, lobbying, chivvying, probing, demanding, urging. Without that, the bureaucratic, psychological and institutional inertia will win out, as it has for the past 30 years. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter.

"It may come as a surprise to discover that it is perfectly legal in the UK to keep primates, such as marmosets, loris, capuchins or squirrel monkeys, as pets. Perhaps more surprising still is that there is no requirement to register or (in some cases) hold a licence for such exotic creatures. The UK Parliament’s Environment, Food and Rural Affairs select committee has published a report that examines the current situation – but does not call for a ban on primate keeping, despite acknowledging that it was the recommendation of the majority of those giving evidence. Bans on keeping primates have been introduced in a number of coutries including Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Australia and some US states. Clearly, the keeping of primates as pets is a hotly contested area. Many people would argue that keeping primates in captivity should be banned entirely. They are after all wild animals, not to be kept for the pleasure of the public. They have complex needs, including social interaction and a varied diet and environment. On the other hand, some hold that zoos, which provide education, conservation and welfare services in the keeping of primates, are justified in maintaining captive populations, while private owners are not.  This argument risks creating an artificial divide that implies that zoos are better places for primates to be kept than in private hands, if they must be kept in captivity at all. From my own experience conducting research in zoos, it is clear that zoo life is never so black and white.  Keepers often work tirelessly for the benefit of the animals, trying to balance the welfare needs of the animals against the wants of the public and the constant limitations of money, time and space. The outcomes may not always be ideal, but this is done out in the public eye, and in the UK, under the guidance of BIAZA, the organisation that represents the role of zoos and aquariums in promoting education, conservation and welfare. But for primates kept as pets, there is no equivalent body to represent the needs of these animals, no animal registry or licence required, and no one to inspect and ensure they are properly cared for.  In the UK, primate keeping must comply with the standards of the Animal Welfare Act 2006, and also follow the “Primate Code”, introduced by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) in 2010 as a guide to the needs of captive primates kept in private collections. The code is a guide to the primates’ social, environmental and physical needs that have a direct impact on their welfare, and how owners should meet these needs. It is due for review in 2015, and this has prompted the committee to produce this study on how best to address some of the monitoring and welfare issues of privately held primates, and how best to improve primates’ welfare. The problem is not that primates kept in private collections are necessarily badly cared for, but that no one really has any idea how many are kept, where, and in what conditions. Estimates range from anywhere between 1,000 and 20,000 primates, and there is no clear information about which species are kept as pets. The guidelines provided in the code are specific neither to the pet owner (individual, zoo, circus), nor the species of animal. This latter point is particularly important, given that the rise in demand from the pet trade for exotic animals is causing increasing problems for maintaining viable populations of threatened species in the wild. This also makes revising the Primate Code challenging: it is impossible to provide species-specific advice for primate carers, as the report recommends, without prior knowledge of which species people own.  The difficulties begin even with definition of the term “pet”. It is defined in the report as an animal, “kept alone in domestic settings, primarily for the purpose of companionship or personal interest”. On the other hand the report acknowledges that Defra has previously stated that to keep a primate in a domestic setting, even when not caged, would be likely to breach the Animal Welfare Act, due to their complex social needs. As a solution, the report suggests that primate owners be required to register their pets, which would at least provide information on who owns what that is so far missing. This is the first and most important step that can be made towards improving guidelines and legislation to monitor the trade. In addition, a more comprehensive licensing system is proposed, which would allow tighter regulation and easier tracking of primates in the pet trade.  While this initial step seems promising, the bigger debate still remains: whether implementing a ban on keeping primates as pets is necessary, and whether it would be effective. One of the arguments against a ban asserts that it is “arrogant” to assume that zoos can care for primates better than private collectors. But without more accurate data on the current state of private primate collections, there’s no basis for this claim. Better information would certainly help to counter claims that a complete ban is baseless, and to address issues of cost.  While many of these arguments against the ban consider the effects on humans, it’s notable that those in favour of a ban consider the outcomes on the animals. A primate trade ban in the UK could have a positive impact on conservation efforts and welfare – and this is the approach we need, one that centres on the needs of the primates. Underlying this report, the question remains: for what reason do we need to keep primates in captivity? The only answer should be for the good of their species, not ours."

Despite being the Great Satan of the green-left, Bjorn Lomborg is hardly a knuckle-dragging, neanderthal climate-change denier. At worst, Lomborg is what is known as a “lukewarmer”: someone who doesn’t doubt the reality of global warming, but suspects that “climate emergency” is a millenarian fantasy. But even such mild doubt is heresy to the warmist inquisitors who’d rather fawn at the feet of ignorant, puritanical children. Lomborg is hardly going to find himself welcomed back into the fold when he insists on trampling on the watermelons’ sacred eco-crucifixes and other ‘renewables’ idols.



In the first of a four-part series demolishing green mythology about renewables, let’s take a quick tour of the history and realities of renewable energy.



The reality is, today, solar and wind energy together deliver only about 1 per cent of global energy. The International Energy Agency estimates that even by 2040 these will cover a little more than 4 per cent of global energy.



One of the world’s leading energy researchers, Czech-Canadian Vaclav Smil, has said: “The great hope for a quick and sweeping transition to renewable energy is wishful thinking.”



Even the church father of global warming, James Hansen, isn’t buying the renewables myth.



“Suggesting that renewables will let us phase rapidly off fossil fuels in the United States, China, India, or the world as a whole is almost the equivalent of believing in the Easter Bunny and Tooth Fairy.”



But there’s money (usually taxpayers’) in them thar windmills.



How has such a fundamental misunderstanding become so firmly entrenched at the centre of climate policy debate? Partly through self-interest. Many private companies — from Vestas to Tesla — have an interest in making us believe the solution is simply to buy lots of their products…



There are a lot of political and activist groups that coalesce support around the idea that climate change can be solved with more green energy and less fossil fuels. But we need to remember that we don’t emit CO2 to annoy environmentalists. It is the by-product of today’s immense availability of power, which provides everything we need and demand from modern society: heat, cold, transport, electricity and food.



And therein lies the rub. Human development is absolutely contingent on energy: cheap as you can make it. When energy is limited and expensive, the elite thrive and the masses wallow in misery.



The link is strong and clear: if you have access to lots of cheap energy, this typically means you’ve escaped poverty, you will live a long life, you have access to a good education and healthcare, you won’t starve to death or die from easily curable diseases. These are manifestly good things, which is why the world has spent the past two centuries ensuring more and more people can access lots of energy.



It’s not as if we haven’t seen what a world run on renewables looks like.



In 1800, almost all energy was renewable. Humanity used energy from draught animals ploughing fields and pulling carts and from firewood heating hearths and homes. And almost everyone put in long hours of harsh, backbreaking labour…



After this, coal, then oil, gas and finally nuclear power were transformative in helping humanity. These gave us the ability to achieve much more with much less labour. At the end of the 19th century, human labour made up 94 per cent of all industrial work in the US. Today, it constitutes only 8 per cent.



Yet humanity has actually never experienced an “energy transition” — a shift from one set of energy sources to another set. Rather, we have added more and more…



But, while the ‘market share’ of renewables plummeted from 94 per cent to 14 per cent over the course of a century (even with the recent intense focus on climate policy), we’re still burning plenty of wood.



Most people think renewables are overwhelmingly made up of solar and wind. Nothing could be further from the truth. Solar and wind contributed only 2.4 per cent of the EU total energy demand in 2017, according to the latest numbers from the International Energy Agency. Another 1.7 per cent came from hydro and 0.4 per cent from geothermal energy.



In comparison, 10 per cent — more than two-thirds of all the ­renewable energy in the EU — comes from the world’s oldest ­energy source: wood.



  
Burning massive amounts of wood while shrieking in horror at the very sight of coal is too obvious an hypocrisy for even the EU. So it tries to hide the fact by rebranding wood as “biomass” and blatantly lying that burning wood somehow doesn’t produce carbon dioxide.



But that’s only the **start** of the problems with renewables.

Share this...FacebookTwitterParts of European academia have obviously lost their marbles, as one apparently crazed professor has called for the death penalty for people who disagree with the IPCC dogma. Call it an interesting case of budding extreme fanaticism.

University of Graz professor calls for the death penalty for people who question the IPCC.
========================================
Dire tones from the University of Graz: music professor calls for the death penalty for climate science dissenters
By Dr Sebastian Lüning and Prof Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
Over the last 30 years huge progress has been made in natural and environmental protection. Exhaust today is being intensively scrubbed, waste-water is being cleaned and energy is being used ever more efficiently. We can consider ourselves fortunate to be living in a time and place where environmental hazards today are hardly a threat to the population.
But what started as a successful and well intentioned environmental movement, now appears to have careened totally out of control. The movement has not done itself any favors by hitching itself to the ideologically led fight against the supposed climate catastrophe. The climate catastrophe scenarios announced 10 years ago by a very convinced IPCC have not come to pass. In stark contradiction to the theoretical prognoses, global temperatures have not risen in 16 years. Over the last decade, the sea level rise has not accelerated, and weather extremes are well within the range of natural variability. A look at the real, measured data and the paleo-climatological reconstructions tells us there is no alarm.
Unfortunately, many media representatives have been unable to depart from their long-loved climate catastrophe. Catastrophes are interesting for readers, viewers and audiences, and they boost ratings and circulation. How on earth would the otherwise empty pages and radio shows be filled if the catastrophe disappeared? As we have been able to show in numerous analyses of recent media reports on the topic of climate at this blog, media reporting is often one-sided, tends to be and is even at times plainly false.
Many media reports would not stand up to any serious scientific review. Sensitized scientists are fortunately in a position to identify the deceit and confusion. Unfortunately many scientifically uneducated people lack the means to check over the science and simply accept the media reports as the truth. Some individuals even allow themselves to be so impressed by the dubious reports that, in their fear of the climate catastrophe, they actually adopt insane beliefs.

Unfortunately one of these people is Richard Parncutt, an Australian professor at the University of Graz. At his university website he seriously calls for “climate deniers” to be punished with the death penalty or life in prison. At his website the following appeared (emphasis added):
In this article I am going to suggest that the death penalty is an appropriate punishment for influential GW [global warming] deniers. But before coming to this surprising conclusion, please allow me to explain where I am coming from.
Even mass murderers should not be executed, in my opinion. Consider the politically motivated murder of 77 people in Norway in 2011. Of course the murderer does not deserve to live, and there is not the slightest doubt that he is guilty. But if the Norwegian government killed him, that would just increase the number of dead to 78. It would not bring the dead back to life. In fact, it would not achieve anything positive at all. I respect the families and friends of the victims if they feel differently about that. I am simply presenting what seems to me to be a logical argument.
GW deniers fall into a completely different category from Behring Breivik. They are already causing the deaths of hundreds of millions of future people. We could be speaking of billions, but I am making a conservative estimate.
[…]
If a jury of suitably qualified scientists estimated that a given GW denier had  already, with high probability (say 95%), caused the deaths of over one million future people, then s/he would be sentenced to death. The sentence would then be commuted to life imprisonment if the accused admitted their mistake, demonstrated genuine regret, AND participated significantly and positively over a long period in programs to reduce the effects of GW (from jail) – using much the same means that were previously used to spread the message of denial. At the end of that process, some GW deniers would  never admit their mistake and as a result they would be executed. Perhaps that would be the only way to stop the rest of them. The death penalty would have been justified in terms of the enormous numbers of saved future lives.
The original page at the University of Graz has been been taken down in the meantime. However copies of the page were first made, for example at webcitation.org, Google Webcache and over at tallbloke. The crazed thinking that Mr. Music Professor here demonstrates is truly frightening. Does he really believe what he is writing or is this pure provocation? Or perhaps it’s a just a nasty hoax, with someone hacking into the university website and slipping in the text? Unlikely. But anything is possible. For Parncutt that would be the best variant, as one does not need to be a psychic to predict that the University of Graz will not simply let this go and that this could have serious personal consequences. It is also unlikely that his colleagues are going to stand up for him. He was never really highly regarded to begin with, as Parncutt himself admits at other locations of the University website.
The media is in a way partly responsible for this. Through their sloppily researched and non-objective articles, radio reports and TV shows, they inflict with their climate alarmism plenty of damage with gullible and emotionally unstable people. It is high time that balanced science finds its way back once again into media reporting, and that the media learn to suppress their zeal for climate alarmism.
Especially in Germany and Austria facts today should count more than ideological convictions.

Guest Post by Caleb Shaw
Ice core sample from Antarctica - Image: British Antarctic SurveyPreface:  Climate Scientists and School Girls – A humorous description of a layman trying to investigate the little bubbles in ice cores,  involving both the actual science,  and a layman’s amazement over the politics.
My last layman’s paper generated a wonderful and polite peer-review from WUWT readers, teaching me a great deal, not the least of which was that I should avoid using the word “pneumatic” when I mean “hydraulic.”  It is in the hopes of receiving a similar polite response that I will venture to ask some questions about a Climate Gospel, even though it is a Climate Gospel that earns most questioners a severe pummeling.
I will attempt to be cheerfully naïve, however in some situations that is not enough.  A Texan can be cheerful and naïve all he wants, but, when he is making cheeseburgers out of a Holy Cow in a Hindu village, he is liable to find he has a riot on his hands.  There are some things Thou Shall Not Do.  Sometimes Thou Shall Not Even Question.
My questions involve those little bubbles in ice cores.  It may seem a harmless subject,  but those little bubbles are a basement upon which a great many papers have been written, and upon which a great many grants depend.  Dare you question the little bubbles,  and all sorts of hell breaks lose.

In fact if you poke around the subject of those little bubbles your don’t-go-there alarm will start to go off,  along with your I-don’t-have-time-for-this alarm, (if you have one.) However sometimes a man’s got to do what he least wants to do.
As anyone who has raised teenaged daughters understands, there are times when you have “to go there,” despite the fact your don’t-go-there alarm is blaring, and times you have to make time, even though your I-don’t-have-time-for-this alarm is howling.
Daughters teach a man that, despite all efforts to ban bullying and legislate spirituality, ostracism remains mysteriously crucial to schoolgirl adolescence, and the same daughter who was sobbing about being ostracized on Monday may be gleaming with glee over a nemesis being ostracized on Tuesday.  Fathers often have to make sense of this emotional and blatant hypocrisy, even if it means turning off the TV just before the big game.
You may be wondering what this has to do with little bubbles in ice caps.  I don’t blame you, but bear with me.
Please notice that, in the above example, it is the daughters doing the teaching. They are teaching their fathers about wild swings of emotion involved with having a non-scientific and supposedly irrational thing called “a heart.”
Scientists don’t like being compared with schoolgirls, because, in humanity’s constant battle to balance the heart and head, Science represents the purified essence of the head.  However just because Science focuses on the head does not mean Scientists have no hearts. “If you prick them, do they not bleed?”
The only thing a scientist is suppose to be passionate about is being dispassionate, however in their quieter moments most will confess there have been times they’ve failed to be totally objective, and have slapped themselves on the forehead because they were blind to some obvious truth staring them in the face.  However even this humbleness underscores an egotism they have about being more objective than most people.  Also, if anyone is going to slap their forehead, they prefer it to be themselves.  They don’t like it one bit when you compare them with schoolgirls.  They get all emotional if you accuse them of being emotional.
Nothing makes people angry faster than accusing them of being angry when they’re not.  A calm, peaceful soul can be reduced to frothing and to spitting snakes, because no one likes being falsely accused.  You can get them even madder if , after you have angered them by accusing them of being angry when they weren’t, you look smug and say, “See?  I told you that you were angry.”
Scientists are no different, and if you tweak them in the right way, then they, who are so focused on the head, will lose their heads and demonstrate they have tremendous hearts. Sometimes the revealed heart is tremendously good, but sometimes it is tremendously otherwise.
Scientists do not like being tweaked in this manner, because that is not what science is all about.  Raving is beneath the dignity of science.  However, when politics enters the hallowed halls of science, scientists get tweaked plenty,  for study is no longer funded for its intrinsic value.  A scientist may abruptly be defunded due to an election.  Men are jarred awake in their Ivory Towers, as they are confronted by a mentality befitting thirteen-year-old schoolgirls:  It matters who is “in” and who is “out.”
Therefore, despite all my shortcoming concerning Physics classes I never took, (or preferred to spend dreaming out the window during,) I do have an understanding others lack, as I approach the delicate subject of little bubbles in an icecap’s ice, because I have been the father of schoolgirls, and know the politics of ostracization and marginalization, and what such things do to the human heart and to human tempers.
One can study both the little bubbles, and also the path to marginalization, by taking a hard look at the travails of Zbigniew Jaworowski.
http://www.nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=25526754-e53a-4899-84af-5d9089a5dcb6&amp;p=3
And also looking at a paper he wrote:
http://folk.uio.no/tomvs/esef/Jaworowski%20CO2%20EIR%202007.pdf
A quick perusal of Jaworoski’s paper taught me that all sorts of complex chemistry may (or may not) being going on in those innocent little bubbles,  but most of the chemistry was over my head.  Not that I couldn’t understand, if I put my mind to it, but I actually had some simple questions, and, until I got those simple questions answered, it seemed I’d be getting ahead of myself if I tackled the complex chemistry.
Therefore I headed to Wikipedia.  Not that I trust it as a source, but it often has links to truer sources, and one hopes Wikipedia gets the most basic facts right.
However even in terms of the most basic facts I seemed to be getting a wide variety of answers.  For example,  how long does it take fluffy snow to be compacted to ice with little bubbles in it?  The answers I got ranged from sixty to five-thousand years.
Likely this variance occurred due to the fact Antarctica includes some areas of very dry desert, where snow accumulates very slowly, whereas Greenland is subject to  Atlantic gales, and snow can accumulate very quickly.  However it was unclear which data-set was being referred to, and that made things rough for a layman like myself.  I had to keep switching back and forth from source to source, and then, when I went back to find an important link at the Wikipedia source, “Greenland ice cores,” just a week ago, I found it had vanished,  and instead there was this message:
06, 12 September 2011 Timothy’s Cannes (talk | contrib.) deleted “Greenland ice cores” ‎ (Mass deletion of pages created by Marshallsumter: questionable creation by now-indeffed editor: see
http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=449961454&amp;oldid=449959111)
As a scientific researcher, my conclusion at this point was, “Oh, Drat.”
Unless you are the sort who rushes in where angels fear to tread, do not, I repeat, DO NOT go to that Wikipedia message board.  I only went because I wanted to see what ice core data “Mashallsumter” got wrong.  As far as I could tell from the morass I waded out into,  the reason “Greenland ice cores” was deleted had nothing to do with the data on that  page,  but rather had to do with some strange beliefs “Mashallsumter” was expressing, and strange research he was involved with, elsewhere in the Wiki-world.
I didn’t much want to know about the fellow’s beliefs and activities, as it seemed to have very little to do with little bubbles in ice, but I couldn’t help notice the marvelous effort that was made to throw “Mashallsumter” from the hallowed halls of Wiki. He was found guilty of both the crime of being original, and the crime of copying.  (What is the third alternative?)  In any case,  “Greenland ice cores” was history, and was history in a hurry, and was deleted history, which hardly counts as history because you can’t find it.
At this point I almost gave up my research, because it occurred to me that something about the study of little bubbles in ice cores makes people weird.  I did not want to become weird.  However my wife reassured me I had nothing to fear, because I already am weird, and that gave me the courage to forge onwards.
part two tomorrow…

Part Four:



 **New purpose in the public service**



But let’s be honest, our wellbeing challenges cannot be solved in one Budget – or even ten. Public investment is a powerful lever for change, but it’s only one.



We also need to **embed the idea of wellbeing in the heart of our public service –** how it works, what it prioritises, who joins and leads it.



That is why earlier this year we announced that we would refocus the New Zealand public service to deliver enduring change, more strongly focused on improving the current and future wellbeing of all New Zealanders.



The changes that we are making in New Zealand are not far from many of the key themes identified in the early stages of your ongoing independent review of the Australian public service – including strengthening culture and leadership, increasing flexibility and capability, and **a focus on working collectively** to achieve better outcomes.



This doesn’t mean our current model is broken. In fact, our public service has a strong international reputation for responsiveness to government, effectiveness for New Zealanders, and integrity.



For instance, New Zealand is ranked second overall in 38 countries assessed on central civil service performance in the 2019 International Civil Service Effectiveness Index.



Closer to home, the 2018 Kiwis Count Survey – published only weeks ago – shows New Zealanders have increasing trust in the public service. **Satisfaction with the provision of services is at a record high.**



So why are we embarking on the biggest reforms to the statutory framework of our public service in more than 30 years?



It’s simple. We know we can do better.



We know **we can build a more modern, agile and adaptive public service.** And we know the importance of the constitutional role our public service has in supporting New Zealand’s democratic form of government.



So we are affirming this role – for current and future generations of New Zealanders – in **new legislation.**



Just weeks ago, our Government announced the most **significant changes** to the New Zealand Public Service since the State Sector Act of 1988. **That will be repealed and replaced with a new Public Service Act.** This will underpin a modernising of the Public Service for the good of New Zealanders and make it easier to tackle the biggest challenges facing the Government of the day.



After all, one department dealing with one part of the problem at a time, can’t fix complex issues like breaking the cycle of child poverty and domestic violence, planning for climate change or providing more effective mental health services. They’re issues that don’t fit neatly into a box, and we can only seriously tackle them with a whole-of-government approach where everyone pushes for the same outcome at the same time.



That’s why under the changes, boards, made up of chief executives from relevant government agencies, will be established to tackle cross cutting challenges. These boards, or joint ventures, will be accountable to a single minister and receive direct Budget appropriations. Public servants from across the system will be deployed as required.



One current example of this is the way we are working to prevent and respond to family and sexual violence. This was a major feature of the Wellbeing Budget. Not only did the Government deliver the largest ever investment into this area but we also delivered a new way of working with the initiative being delivered across eight portfolios: Attorney General, Corrections, Courts, Health, Justice, Oranga Tamariki, Police, and Social Development.



But we know we need more than structural changes. As our Minister of State Services Chris Hipkins has said **the shift to a single, unified public service approach will be complemented by cultural change** with the new Act acknowledging that a ‘spirit of service to the community’ is fundamental to the Public Service.



 **A unified public sector around common purpose, principles and values** is crucial and we believe we can encourage that practically by making it easier for public servants to move seamlessly through the public service as a whole.



Building trust also means a strengthened **public service that supports the Government’s commitment** to a stronger Maori/Crown relationship, helping improve outcomes for Maori, the indigenous people of our country.



And **we want a more diverse and inclusive public service workforce** that reflects the communities it serves.



I want to be clear that this is not about a sudden, large-scale system change.



As I said a few minutes ago, New Zealand’s Public Service in good shape. So **changes will be carefully phased and managed over time** , with a legislative process that will run into mid-2020.



In the meantime, we are getting on with a wider work programme.



To take just one example, Public Sector chief executives are **charged with tackling the gender pay gap in the core public service** , which the Government is committed to eliminating.



Substantial progress has been made this Parliamentary term. The public service Gender Pay Gap Action Plan, established in July 2018 includes a focus on:



Women now lead some of the largest public service agencies including our Ministries of Education, Social Development, and Business, Innovation and Employment, Corrections, Treasury, and of course the country.



 **Good government matters in the world**



But all of this is of course part of a much wider goal. Building a public sector than can help build good government. But as is so often the case in this sphere – the buck ultimately starts and stops with us, the politicians.



As leaders globally, we are facing **a rising tide of public suspicion towards government** , a sense that we’ve let the material differences between us stretch beyond fairness, and as a result **there are signs of life in old ideologies.**



But if we begin at home, if we broaden our idea of good government and act with a sense of fairness of guardianship – and even kindness – of what we in New Zealand call manaakitanga and kaitiakitanga – then I absolutely believe we will make headway on these challenges.



But **we won’t succeed unless** we apply these same values **globally.**



For countries like New Zealand and Australia, that means **prioritising international rules and norms t** hat work for all countries.



It means encouraging trade, not retreating behind protectionist barriers – trade that means jobs and livelihoods, but also trade shaped by an open, honest dialogue with our communities.



Here, I do think, Australia and New Zealand can be examples to the world.



We share a strong commitment to the rules-based international trading system that is currently under such strain. I welcome and endorse Prime Minister Morrison’s call for countries to mend, not end, this system and to reject the idea that trade is a zero-sum game.



But we can enhance our expectation of the trade agenda to lift labour and environmental standards and prove that they too can respond to the very issues they’re accused of ignoring.



Times may be challenging but I absolutely believe politics can be a place for change, disruption, and a force for good. Good government need not be an oxymoron.

The molecular epidemiology of bluetongue virus (BTV) since 1998: routes of introduction of different serotypes and individual virus strains. Image: Wikipedia
Farm animal disease to increase with climate change
Researchers looked at changes in the behaviour of bluetongue – a viral disease of cattle and sheep – from the 1960s to the present day, as well as what could happen to the transmission of the virus 40 years into the future. They found, for the first time, that an outbreak of a disease could be explained by changes to the climate.

In Europe, more than 80,000 outbreaks of bluetongue were reported to the World Animal Health Organisation between 1998 and 2010, and millions of animals died as a result of the disease. Bluetongue was previously restricted to Africa and Asia, but its emergence in Europe is thought to be linked to increased temperatures, which allows the insects that carry the virus to spread to new regions and transmit the virus more effectively.
Researchers produced a mathematical model that explains how the risk of an outbreak of bluetongue virus in Europe changes under different climate conditions. The team examined the effect of past climate on the risk of the virus over the past 50 years to understand the specific triggers for disease outbreak over time and throughout geographical regions. This model was then driven forwards in time, using predictive climate models, to the year 2050, to show how the disease may react to future climate change.
Using these future projections, researchers found that in northern Europe there could be a 17% increase in incidence of the bluetongue virus, compared to 7% in southern regions, where it is already much warmer.
Professor Matthew Baylis, from the University’s Institute of Infection and Global Health, said: “Previous study suggests that climate change will alter global disease distribution, and although we have significant knowledge of the climate triggers for particular diseases, more research is needed to identify what we think might really happen in the future.
“We have been able to show that the past emergence of a disease can be explained, in both space and time, by changes to recent climate. These results reinforce the belief that future climate change will threaten our health and well-being by causing infection to spread. Looking forward, this could help inform decision making processes on preparing for disease outbreaks and reduce the huge economic impact that farm animal diseases can have on communities.”
The research is published in Proceedings of the Royal Society Interface.

 **This is Chris Edwards’ rebuttal to Professor Thomas Piketty in alarger debate on tax policy.**



In his opening statement for the tax debate sponsored by _The Economist_ , Thomas Piketty argues that we should impose a very high tax rate of about 80 percent on the top income earners in society. The following rebuttal of this idea addresses Piketty’s philosophy of income, and it discusses problems with his political, economic, and historical reasons for tax increases on high earners.



 **Piketty’s Philosophy of Income**



Piketty’s understanding of the nature of income is very European. He implies that there is a fixed income pie, such that any income that high earners receive must come at the expense of others. Because the share of income earned by the top 1 percent has increased, he says that there has been “an income transfer of about 14 points of national income” to the top group. But high earners did not take that money from other people, they generated it by their own efforts.



In a market economy, there is no central pile of money that is distributed out to the citizens. Each person produces value and earns income by voluntary exchange in a decentralised fashion. Compensation follows from people producing items of value to others. Of course there are exceptions, such as those high‐​earning CEOs who perform poorly, but it doesn’t make economic sense to impose exorbitant tax rates because of the exceptions.



Those at the top end—the entrepreneurs, doctors, and others with unique skills—often generate benefits that are greater than their reward in compensation. One reason is that there is scope for innovation in top‐​end jobs like heart surgery that there isn’t in lower‐​income jobs. The trash collector’s wage matches his contribution, but when the surgeon invents a new medical technique, it can create long‐​lasting benefits for the rest of us that will only be partly reflected in compensation.



I have people like Apple’s Steve Jobs in mind when I think about designing tax policy for the top 1%. But Piketty seems to think that those at the top end did not earn their compensation, rather their high pay came from amorphous forces such as “gains from globalisation.” However, let’s say Piketty is right, that the innovators behind firms like Apple just happened to be lucky that their products became global bestsellers. It still makes no sense to impose high taxes on them because those entrepreneurs are more likely to use the cash productively than the government. Indeed, from the beginning of Silicon Valley, wave after wave of millionaires have funded the next wave of business successes through angel financing and venture capital. Obviously, that would not have been possible under Piketty’s 80% tax rate.



A final note on income is that Piketty’s calculations on the rising income share of the top 1% are much less precise than he pretends. Piketty’s work is based on income as reported on tax returns, but there have been huge changes in the American tax system since the 1970s that make measuring income over time very difficult. My colleague Alan Reynolds has tackled some of these problems with the Piketty data.1 One issue is that the top federal income tax rate fell from 70% in the late 1970s to 35% today, with the result that high‐​income taxpayers are avoiding and evading taxes less, and reporting more income on their returns.



If you look at Piketty’s data showing the share of income received by the top 1% since the 1970s, you will see sudden upward spikes after major tax rate cuts. That suggests that a portion of the income gains at the high end are not based on structural factors, such as globalisation as Piketty suggests, but are simply expected responses to changes in tax law. In a 2009 paper, Emmanuel Saez and co‐​authors confirmed that, noting:





**Piketty’s Political Arguments**



Mr. Piketty argues that if we don’t impose very high taxes on the rich “there is a serious risk that citizens will ask for much more damaging, anti‐​market policies.” _The Economist_ debate proposition similarly suggests that we need to buy “social peace” by imposing high tax rates at the top. I think the reality is exactly the opposite. The more arbitrary and punitive government intervention becomes, the more that politicians and the public will get used to it, and the more likely that further punitive measures will be imposed. The government that persecutes certain people with 80% tax rates will find it much easier to expropriate the property of other groups it deems to be a menace. The more that politicians try to centrally plan the end goals for society, the less they will focus on making the general rules of government equal and fair. 



**Piketty’s Economic Arguments**



This is a strange statement by Piketty: “The idea that heavy taxes on very top incomes would entail huge economic distortions is purely ideological and is based on zero empirical evidence.” I don’t understand how a public finance specialist could say that, unless he is hiding behind the word “huge.” Are the distortions “large” Mr. Piketty?



One mistake Piketty makes is to suggest that tax distortions are caused only by changes to labour supply. But the economic distortion caused by high tax rates is related to the total taxable income response, not just to changes in labor supply. Martin Feldstein, one the top public finance experts of recent decades, has stressed that point repeatedly. Feldstein’s empirical work shows that the economic distortions caused by high marginal rates are large. Increases in marginal tax rates set into a motion a whole range of behavioral responses, all of which add to deadweight losses. Piketty’s own co‐​author, Emmanuel Saez, has found that behavioural responses are substantially greater at the top end, indicating that the top tax rates are the most distortionary.3



In the United States, half of all business income is reported on individual returns, not corporate returns, and a lot of that business income is reported by people at the top end. If you raise individual income taxes at the top end, you hit a large amount of small business income. And empirical research has shown that small businesses are sensitive to income tax changes. A series of studies by economists Robert Carroll, Douglas Holtz‐​Eakin, Mark Rider and Harvey Rosen explored, for example, the effect of marginal income tax rates on small business hiring, investment, and growth.4 They found substantial effects, such as that a five percentage point cut in marginal tax rates would cause a 10% increase in capital expenditures.



But Piketty doesn’t mention entrepreneurial businesses. Instead, he repeatedly implies that the only people who earn top incomes are shady corporate executives, who operate a “crude skimming model” rather than earning their pay. Actually, the literature on executive compensation is mixed in its conclusions regarding the extent to which executive pay is based on market forces. Scholars Kevin Murphy and Jan Zabojnik, for example, argue that there are market reasons why CEO compensation has risen quickly in recent decades.5 As in any market, the market for corporate executives makes mistakes that are corrected over time, which is something we cannot say about governments. These days, corporate executives operate in a very stressful and risky environment, and they are subject to very high firing rates—a much different climate, for example, than tenured university professors. 



**Piketty’s Historical Arguments**



Piketty thinks that “confiscatory marginal rates applied to the very high incomes of the 1932–80 period were a pretty good policy.” That is quite a claim, but let me just note that the world has vastly changed since the mid‐​20th century. I co‐​authored a book last year, “Global Tax Revolution”, which documented the worldwide movement to cut tax rates on skilled workers, entrepreneurs, and corporations since the 1970s.



During Piketty’s golden era in the 20th century, most industrial countries had fixed exchange rates, which allowed them to seal their borders to capital flows and to keep tax rates high. But nations started floating their currencies in the 1970s and dismantling their exchange controls, with the result that cross‐​border capital flows have exploded. Virtually every advanced nation has responded with dramatic cuts to top rates on those taxes that have the most mobile bases. Even socialist Sweden recently abolished its wealth tax because it was scaring away too many productive people, such as Ingvar Kamprad, the founder of IKEA, who moved to Switzerland. 



High tax rates in the mid‐​20th century were not good for the economy then, but they would be a disastrous today. In recent years, Europe has seen the most intensive tax competition for skilled workers and businesses anywhere in the world, so it is surprising that Piketty doesn’t understand that.

Good morning, Chairman Bono‐​Mack, Ranking Member Butterfield and members of the subcommittee. I am Daniel Ikenson, associate director of the Center for Trade Policy Studies at the Cato Institute. Today, I am very pleased to be able to share my views on the topic of manufacturing, trade, jobs, and other economic issues related to the subject of today’s hearing. The views I express are my own and should not be construed as representing any official positions of the Cato Institute.



 **Introduction**



Increasing the number of jobs in the economy by expanding trade — both exports and imports — is a good bet. Historically, there has been a strong relationship between economic growth, trade (both exports and imports, individually and combined), and job creation in the United States. In the quarter century between 1983 and 2007, as real GDP more than doubled and the real value of U.S. trade increased five‐​fold, the U.S. economy created 46 million net new jobs, or 1.84 million net new jobs per year.1 In 22 of those 25 years, the annual changes in GDP, trade, and job creation all moved in the same direction — either all positive or all negative. And as economic growth came to a halt and then turned negative in 2008 and 2009, respectively, trade contracted by 12 percent and the economy shed over six million jobs.



Despite the “Made in America” orientation of today’s hearing, it is important to note that trade in products that are made in America, or partially‐​made in America, or designed in America but produced abroad, or entirely designed and produced abroad from components manufactured abroad supports U.S. jobs up and down the supply chain through various channels. Both exports and imports support U.S. jobs.



But many Americans believe that exports are good, imports are bad, the trade account is the scoreboard, the trade deficit means the United States is losing at trade, and it is losing because our trade partners cheat. Many point to the trade deficit as the obvious explanation for the much exaggerated death of U.S. manufacturing. According to polling data, Americans are generally skeptical about trade and its impact on jobs, manufacturing, and the U.S. economy. And why shouldn’t they be? After all, the public is barraged routinely with misleading or simplistic coverage of trade issues by a media that is too often heavy on cliché, innuendo, and regurgitated conventional wisdom, and lacking in substance and analysis.



President Obama has already offered his answer to the question implicit in this hearing. His National Export Initiative aims to double U.S. exports in five years by reducing and eliminating various administrative, regulatory, and financial obstacles faced by U.S. exporters. Although the plan features some laudable components, it includes several errors of omission and commission that are likely to limit or undermine the NEI’s success.



In the pages to follow, this testimony will address and attempt to correct lingering misperceptions about trade and manufacturing, describe some of the shortcomings of the NEI, and offer some alternatives for increasing economic growth and creating jobs through trade.



 **The Myth of Manufacturing Decline**



Americans often hear that some nefarious foreign trade practices are to blame for the decline of U.S. manufacturing. But the problem with that presumption of causation is that U.S. manufacturing is not in decline in the first place. Until the onset of the recent recession (when virtually every sector in the economy contracted), U.S. manufacturing was setting new performance records almost year after year in nearly all relevant statistical categories: profits, revenues, investment returns, output, value added, exports, imports, and others. After contracting during the recession of 2008 and 2009, the manufacturing sector has come roaring back. According to the Institute for Supply Management, economic activity expanded in the manufacturing sector for the 19th consecutive month in February 2011, reaching its highest level since May 2004.2



In absolute terms, the value of U.S. manufacturing has been growing continuously, with brief hiccups experienced during recessions over the past several decades. As a percentage of our total economy, the value of manufacturing peaked in 1953 and has been declining since, but that is the product of rapid growth in the services sectors and not — as evidenced by manufacturing’s absolute growth — an indication of manufacturing decline.3



The preponderance of Chinese and other imported goods on retail store shelves may give the impression that America does not make anything anymore — a fallacy sensationally exploited by ABC News in its recent series, “Made in America.” But U.S. factories make lots of things — in particular, high‐​value products that are less likely to be found in retail stores — like airplanes, advanced medical devices, sophisticated machinery, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and biotechnology products. American manufacturers are no longer heavily in the business of making sporting goods, tools, clothing, footwear, housewares, and furniture, but their factories are still the world’s most prolific, accounting for 21.4 percent of global manufacturing value‐​added in 2008, while China accounted for 13.4 percent.4



America has maintained its industrial preeminence by transitioning away from high‐​volume, low‐​value industries into higher value‐​added production. In the process, the number of jobs in the manufacturing sector — perhaps the most important metric from a political standpoint — has declined. U.S. manufacturing employment reached its peak of 19.4 million jobs in 1979 — **fourteen years before the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreements and 22 years before China joined the World Trade Organization**. So the downward trend in manufacturing employment, along roughly the same trajectory for 30 years, began long before the common scapegoats for manufacturing job loss even existed.



Manufacturing job loss has very little to do with trade and a lot to do with changes in technology that lead to productivity gains and changes in consumer tastes. China has also experienced a decline in manufacturing jobs — in fact, many more jobs have been lost in China’s manufacturing sector — for the same reasons. According to a 2004 study published by the Conference Board, China lost 15 million manufacturing jobs between 1995 and 2002, a period during which 2 million U.S. manufacturing jobs were lost.5



The fact of the matter is that, with the exception of cyclical contractions during noted economic recessions, the U.S. manufacturing has been thriving in the global economy. Whether U.S. manufacturing will continue to thrive and even become a reliable job creator in the years ahead depends to some extent on the public policies adopted and eschewed.



 **No Longer “Us” vs. “Them”**



During the past few decades, a truly global division of labor has emerged, presenting opportunities for specialization, collaboration, and exchange on scales once unimaginable. The confluence of falling trade and investment barriers, revolutions in communications and transportation, the opening of China to the West, the collapse of communism, and the disintegration of Cold War political barriers has spawned a highly integrated global economy with vast potential to produce greater wealth and higher living standards.



The dramatic reduction in transportation and communication costs combined with widespread liberalization of trade, finance, and political barriers are all accomplices in what has been called “the death of distance.” Under the new paradigm, the factory floor is no longer contained within four walls and one roof. Instead, the factory floor spans the globe through a continuum of production and supply chains, allowing lead firms to optimize investment and output decisions by matching production, assembly, and other functions to the locations best suited for those activities. 



In the 21st century, it is inaccurate to characterize international trade as a competition between “us” and “them.” Because of foreign direct investment, joint ventures, and other equity‐​sharing arrangements, quite often “we” are “they” and “they” are “we.” Even the U.S. automobile and steel industries attest to this new reality. And as a result of the proliferation of disaggregated, transnational production and supply chains, “we” and “they” often collaborate in the same endeavor. Under the new paradigm, workers in developed and emerging countries are more likely to be coworkers than competitors. Today’s global economic competition is less likely to feature “our” producers against “their” producers and more likely to feature entities that defy national identification because they are truly international in their operations, creating products and services from value‐​added activities in multiple countries. There is competition between supply chains, but success first demands cooperation and collaboration within supply chains (i.e., cooperation and collaboration between some of “us” and some of “them”). This new commercial reality demands policies that are welcoming of imports and foreign investment, and that minimize regulations or administrative frictions that are based on misconceptions about some vague or ill‐​defined “national interest.”



A recent analysis from the Asian Development Bank Institute of the complex production‐​supply chain surrounding production of Apple’s iPhone is both testament to the benefits of globalization and the latest indictment of a decrepit international trade flow accounting system that nourishes misleading trade skeptics and misinforms policy.



Following in the footsteps of a groundbreaking and widely‐​cited 2007 University of California‐​Irvine study, which disaggregated the components of a Chinese‐​assembled Apple iPod and assigned its constituent value to the companies and countries responsible for their production, two researchers at the Asian Development Bank Institute applied a similar analysis to the Apple iPhone. Like the UC‐​Irvine iPod study before it, the ADBI analysis found that just a tiny fraction of the cost of producing the iPhone is Chinese value‐​added. The only Chinese input is labor, which is used to assemble the components manufactured in other countries. The value of that labor accounts for $6.50 or 3.6 percent of the total cost of $178.96 to produce an iPhone (about the same percentage as the iPod). The other 96.4 percent of that total is the cost of components produced (and the labor and overhead employed to produce those components) in Japan, Germany, South Korea, the United States, and several other countries. This breakdown is very similar to that found for the iPod in 2007, and the punch lines are identical.



While firms in Japan and Germany account for the most expensive parts (and quite obviously benefit from the advent of the iPhone), most of the value of the iPhone (like the iPod) accrues to Apple, which reaps the lion’s share of the approximately 100 percent markup. When iPhones sell for $399 in the United States, the difference between that retail price and the $178.96 cost of production goes to retailers, distributors, marketers, other firms in the supply chain, and to Apple, which distributes some earnings to its shareholders and retains some for research and development, supporting engineering and design jobs higher up the value chain so that the virtuous circle can continue.



Rather than appreciate how this complementary process harnesses the benefits of our globalized division of labor, some begrudge iPod and iPhone sales in the United States for adding to the bilateral trade deficit. Technically, for every $399 iPhone sold in the United States, the U.S. bilateral trade deficit with China increases by $178.96 (its full cost of production). Even though only $6.50 of that iPhone is Chinese value, under our antiquated, pre‐​globalization, method of tallying a nation’s imports and exports, the entire $178.96 is chalked up as an import from China because that was the product’s final point of assembly. According to the authors of the ADBI study, iPhones added $1.9 billion to the politically volatile U.S. trade deficit with China in 2009. Alas, this is the basis of the claim — popular among the most shameless trade critics — that America has a “high‐​tech” trade deficit with China.



Should we lament a trade deficit in iPhones or any other products assembled abroad, particularly when those products comprise U.S. value‐​added and support high‐​paying U.S. jobs?



U.S. factories and workers are more likely to be collaborating with Chinese factories and workers in production of the same goods than they are to be competing directly. The proliferation of vertical integration (whereby the production process is carved up and each function performed where it is most efficient to perform that function) and transnational supply chains has joined higher value‐​added U.S. manufacturing, design, and R&D activities with lower‐​value manufacturing and assembly operations in China. Though the focus is typically on American workers who are displaced by competition from China, legions of American workers and their factories, offices, and laboratories would be idled without access to complementary Chinese workers in Chinese factories. Without access to lower‐​cost labor in places like Shenzhen, countless ideas hatched in U.S. laboratories — which became viable commercial products that support hundreds of thousands of jobs in engineering, design, marketing, logistics, retailing, finance, accounting, and manufacturing — might never have made it beyond conception because the costs of production would have been deemed prohibitive for mass consumption. Just imagine if all of the components in the Apple iPhone had to be manufactured and assembled in the United States. Instead of $178.96 per unit, the cost of production might be multiple times that amount, and quite possibly prohibitive.



Consider how many fewer iPhones Apple would have sold; how many fewer jobs iPhone production, distribution, and sales would have supported; how many fewer young programmers would be employed designing “apps”; how much lower Apple’s profits (and those of the entities in its supply chains) would have been; how much lower Apple’s research and development expenditures would have been; how much smaller the markets for music and video downloads, car accessories, jogging accessories, and docking stations would be; how many fewer jobs those industries would support; and the lower profits those industries would generate. Now multiply that process by the hundreds of other similarly ubiquitous devices and gadgets: computers, hand‐​held video game players, Blu‐​Ray devices, and every other product that is designed in the United States and assembled in China from components made in the United States and elsewhere.



It is beyond question that countless U.S. jobs depend on imports from China. _The Atlantic_ ’s James Fallows characterizes the complementarity of U.S. and Chinese production sharing as following the shape of a “Smiley Curve” plotted on a chart where the production process from start to finish is measured along the horizontal axis and the value of each stage of production is measured on the vertical axis. U.S. value‐​added comes at the early stages — in branding, product conception, engineering, and design. Chinese value‐​added operations occupy the middle stages — some engineering, some manufacturing and assembly, primarily. And more U.S. value‐​added occurs at the end stages in logistics, retailing, and after‐​market servicing. Under this typical production arrangement, collaboration, not competition, is what links U.S. and Chinese workers.



Over the past couple of centuries, economists have spoken of comparative advantage in the context of industries. In David Ricardo’s telling, Portugal had a comparative advantage in wine‐​making and England had a comparative advantage in cloth‐​making. So each country would focus its productive efforts where they were most efficient, and exchange surpluses, to attain the highest level of output and consumption. Today comparative advantage can apply to functions in the supply chain. China may have a comparative advantage in electronic assembly operations vis‐​á‐​vis the United States today, the United States may have a comparative advantage in product design vis‐​á‐​vis Japan, and Japan may have a comparative advantage in component production. Instead of trading wine for cloth, the modern set‐​up implies a collaboration between U.S. engineers, Japanese manufacturers, and Chinese assemblers — that is, collaboration in the production of Apple iPods and similar products. But as a country’s skill sets change — partly as a function of its policies — the people will become relatively more efficient in some endeavors and relatively less efficient in others.



That countries are not destined to remain in their current supply chain rungs, but can ascend or descend the value‐​chain, as the case may be, should be motivation enough for governments, both rich and poor, and at all stages of development, to adopt the policies that are most likely to provide the greatest and highest valued‐​added opportunities for their people.



 **Imports Get an Undeservedly Bad Rap**



People generally understand that exports contribute to economic growth, which is essential to job creation. But many then make the mistake of reasoning: if exports help grow the economy and create jobs, then imports must shrink the economy and cost jobs. That is the central misconception perpetrated by media every month when the Census Bureau releases the monthly trade figures. Emblematic of this kind of bad reporting is last week’s story by AP Economics Writer Martin Crutsinger, who wrote: “A widening trade deficit hurts the U.S. economy. When imports outpace exports, more jobs go to foreign workers than to U.S. workers.” Well, that outcome is possible, but as an ironclad law, it is an indefensible statement.



The description of global production and supply chains above is a fairly strong argument for the benefits of imports and strong evidence that imports support U.S. jobs. But imports support U.S. employment through many other channels, as well. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, “intermediate goods” and “capital equipment” — items purchased by producers, not consumers — accounted for more than 55 percent of the value of all U.S. imports last year. So, imports that are too often assumed to be consumer goods that come at the expense of domestic production are more often than not used as inputs for domestic production. Better and more affordable access to those imports helps reduce the costs of production, enabling producers to better compete and support U.S. jobs and wages. The 45 percent of imports that are consumer goods support U.S. jobs in logistics, transportation, wholesaling, retailing, and after‐​market service industries. The nearby charts show how imports move in tandem with GDP and employment.





And by helping to keep prices lower and quality higher, imports allow consumers to have more resources with which to purchase other products and services or to save, both of which support more U.S. jobs. The next set of charts compares price changes over time of products that tend to be heavily traded and products and services that are generally not traded.





Moreover, when U.S. consumers and producers purchase imports, foreigners obtain dollars with which they can support U.S. jobs through their own purchase of U.S. exports or through investment in U.S. businesses.



Some of the misunderstanding can be traced to the famous National Income Identity, which expresses gross domestic product, as: Y = C + G + I + (X-M). That is, national output (Y) equals personal consumption (C) plus government spending (G) plus investment (I) plus exports (X) minus imports (M).



The expression clearly lends itself to the wrong interpretation. The minus sign preceding imports suggests a negative relationship with output. It is the reason for the oft‐​repeated fallacy that imports are a drag on growth. But that is the wrong conclusion.



The expression is an accounting identity, which “accounts” for all of the possible channels for disposing of our national output. That output is either consumed in the private sector (C), consumed by government (G), invested by business (I), or exported (X). The identity requires subtraction of aggregate imports because consumption, government spending, business investment, and exports all contain, in various amounts, import value. Americans consume domestic and imported products and services, the aggregate of which shows up in consumption. Likewise, government purchases include domestic and imported products and services; businesses invest in domestic and imported machines and inventory; and, exports often contain some imported intermediate components. Thus, the identity would overstate national output if it didn’t make that adjustment for imports. After all, imports are not made on U.S. soil with U.S. factors of production, so they shouldn’t be included in an expression of our national output.



To reiterate, it is a simple matter of accounting: as an expression of national output, the National Income Identity subtracts imports only because imports are that portion of consumption, government spending, investment, and exports that are not produced on U.S. soil with U.S. factors of production. If we did not subtract an aggregate import value, then national output would be overstated.



But this is unnecessarily confusing. Why has it not been commonplace to use notation that conveys in no uncertain terms that C and G and I and X include some amount of imports? Maybe something like this: Y=C(d)+C(m)+G(d)+G(m)+I(d)+I(m)+X(d)+X(m)-M, where (d) connotes domestic; (m) connotes imported; and M=C(m)+G(m)+I(m)+X(m).



Again, imports are subtracted, not because they are a drag on output, but because imports are included in the other constituent elements of the identity. I’ve always found it misleading that the parentheses go around X-M — which isolates the expression “net exports,” but in the process can obscure the fact that imports are subtracted from the whole expression.



 **The National Export Initiative**



In his February 2010 State of the Union address President Obama announced a goal of doubling U.S. exports in five years. That goal was soon enshrined as the “National Export Initiative,” which has since become the centerpiece of the administration’s trade policy agenda.



Some of the components of the NEI are eminently sensible as standalone policies. For example, efforts to clarify, simplify, and streamline U.S. export control procedures — should they succeed — are likely to reduce regulatory obstacles and spur meaningful export growth without imposing new burdens or diverting resources from elsewhere in the economy. Likewise, passage of the long‐​pending bilateral trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia, and Panama, and conclusion of the decade‐​long Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations and the ongoing Trans‐​Pacific Partnership negotiations would reduce or eliminate barriers to U.S. exports in a variety of sectors. And, it would not be unreasonable to expect that the resulting increase in trade would lead to job growth — despite the anomaly of 2010 (i.e., positive economic growth, strong trade growth, but negative job growth).



But other aspects of the National Export Initiative — call them errors of omission and commission — are more troubling. The NEI presumes that the only obstacles confronting U.S. exporters are those that exclusively concern their activities as exporters. But, in fact, before they are exporters these companies are producers, and as producers they have production costs that are often inflated by dint of policy — import duties, a weak dollar, regulatory compliance costs. The NEI is silent on these significant obstacles to U.S. competitiveness at home and abroad.



According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, “intermediate goods” and “capital equipment” — items purchased by producers, not consumers — accounted for more than 55 percent of the value of all U.S. imports last year. That fact alone makes clear that imports are crucial determinants of the profitability of U.S. producers and their capacity to compete at home and abroad. Yet the NEI commits not a word to the task of eliminating or reducing the burdens of government policies that inflate import prices and production costs.



During the decade between 2000 and 2009, the United States imposed 164 antidumping measures on a variety of products from dozens of countries. A total of 131 of those 164 measures restricted (and in most cases, still restrict) imports of intermediate goods and raw materials used by downstream U.S. producers in the production of their final products. The cases were filed and the duties imposed without any of these downstream companies having had the opportunity to make their case before the International Trade Commission that the duties would adversely affect them. Under the present antidumping statute, the administering authorities are forbidden from considering the impact on consuming industries — or the impact on the economy more broadly — when deciding whether or not to levy the duties. That is a major oversight that should have been identified as an obstacle to U.S. export competitiveness by the administration in its development of the NEI.



In January, a _Wall Street Journal_ editorial featured the story of what was recently a profitable and expanding magnesium die‐​cast auto parts industry in the United States. The U.S. and foreign markets for these engine parts (which are lighter but stronger than the more common aluminum parts, so in high demand from auto producers looking to improve fuel efficiency) were growing. But then the sole U.S. producer of magnesium — a monopolist in Utah — brought an antidumping case against imports from China and Russia. The resulting duties drove the cost of magnesium in the United States well above the world price, and slowly but surely, the U.S. firms started to die off. That an industry comprised of a single producer with 370 employees can snuff out downstream industries — particularly up‐​and‐​coming industries — is costly economic policy that the NEI should be addressing.



Another concern about the NEI is that it may tempt the administration further down the slippery slope of industrial policy. Although doubling exports to $3.14 trillion by the end of 2014 would be a laudable achievement, enshrining that goal as a national imperative presents risks. “Five‐​Year Plans” have a way of breeding zealous devotion to goals for the sake of goals, sometimes at the expense of the process that would otherwise lay the foundation for greater and enduring success. By exhorting U.S. exporters to “win the future” and describing the imperative of “making sure we’re not ceding markets, exports, and the jobs they support to other nations,” the president is reinforcing an image of trade as an adversarial, zero‐​sum endeavor.



With over $100 billion in direct subsidies and tax credits already devoted to green technology, it is no secret that President Obama has been promoting investment in solar panel, wind harnessing, lithium ion battery, and other industries he deems crucial. Concerning those industries, the president said: “Countries like China are moving even faster… I’m not going to settle for a situation where the United States comes in second place or third place or fourth place in what will be the most important economic engine of the future.“6



With all due respect, how does the president know that those will be the most important economic engines of the future? By placing bets on particular industries, the administration is overriding a selective, evolutionary process that has undergirded the world’s most successful innovation machine, while reducing the chances of worthy ideas, firms, and industries leading the next commercial wave. Did President Obama’s predecessors anticipate the arrival of Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, or Marc Zuckerberg and the revolutionary products and services they delivered? Did Washington bureaucrats foresee the advent of specific life‐​extending medicines and devices, like digestible, pill‐​sized cameras? Had those proposing industrial policy in response to a rising Japan in the 1980s and early 1990s prevailed, much of the technology and medical advances taken for granted today never would have come to fruition. 



Despite the risks and uncertainty of industrial policy, the administration seems to be getting a lot of encouragement in that direction from a wide swath of captains of industry, economics writers, and media pundits.



 **Policy Solutions**



A serious plan to boost U.S. economic growth and hiring should start by identifying all policies, regulations, practices, and conditions that impede U.S. competitiveness, not just those obstacles that confront U.S. companies as exporters.



Although trade’s critics speak of a “race to the bottom,” where governments compete for investment by lowering their standards — a concern unsupported by trade and investment flows — it is really more appropriate to speak of a race to the top. Governments are competing for business investment and talent, which both tend to flow to jurisdictions where the rule of law is clear and abided; where there is greater certainty to the business and political climate; where the specter of asset expropriation is negligible; where physical and administrative infrastructure is in good shape; where the local work force is productive; where there are limited physical, political, and administrative frictions; and so on. Those once‐​clear American advantages have atrophied.7



This global competition in policy is a positive development, but we are kidding ourselves if we think that we don’t have to compete and earn our share with good policies. The decisions we make now with respect to policies on immigration, education, energy, trade, entitlements, taxes, and the role of government in managing the economy will determine the number and kinds of jobs created, as well as the health, competitiveness, and relative significance of the U.S. economy in the decades ahead.



According to a survey of 13,000 business executives worldwide, conducted by the World Economic Forum, 52 countries have less burdensome regulations than the United States. Add to the fact that the United States has the highest corporate tax rate among all OECD countries, the sense that the rule of law is no longer bedrock, the business and political climates remain uncertain, asset expropriation (through torts, bankruptcy, antitrust and other mechanisms) is a real threat, the workforce doesn’t have the skills required by producers in an economy at the technological fore, the regulatory environment is stifling, compliance costs are eating into the bottom lines of more and more companies, the government treats our innovators as adversaries, physical infrastructure is in disrepair, and it becomes less mysterious why U.S. businesses aren’t investing and hiring in droves. Meanwhile, forward‐​looking governments around the world are wooing investment in R&D facilities, high‐​end manufacturing plants, and educated human beings with proper incentives, as U.S. policies treat those investors and skilled immigrants with contempt or indifference.



President Obama visited recently with the Chamber of Commerce and argued that he had made concessions to business by moving toward the center on tax and trade policy, and that now was the time for business to reciprocate by investing and hiring. But the president’s small steps toward the center come after two years of sprinting to the left on economic policy. After ObamaCare, Dodd‐​Frank, taxpayer bailouts, unorthodox and legally‐​questionable bankruptcy procedures, subsidies for select industries, Buy American and other regulations governing how and with whom “stimulus” dollars could be spent, and the administration’s tightening embrace of industrial policy, businesses want a more quiet, less intrusive, less antagonistic, predictable policy environment before they will feel comfortable investing and hiring. In the meantime, a policy that would likely produce quick dividends would be one that reduces the administrative costs of importing. After all, most U.S. exporters — before they are exporters — are producers. And as producers they consume raw materials and other industrial inputs and components. Many of those inputs are imported or their costs are affected by the availability and prices of imports.



The president understands this. On August 11, 2010 at a White House signing ceremony, he offered the following rationale for a bill he was about to sign into law:



The Manufacturing Enhancement Act of 2010 will create jobs, help American companies compete, and strengthen manufacturing as a key driver of our economic recovery. And here’s how it works. To make their products, manufacturers — some of whom are represented here today — often have to import certain materials from other countries and pay tariffs on those materials. This legislation will reduce or eliminate some of those tariffs, which will significantly lower costs for American companies across the manufacturing landscape — from cars to chemicals; medical devices to sporting goods. And that will boost output, support good jobs here at home, and lower prices for American consumers.



It’s tough to argue with that rationale. After all, “intermediate goods” and “capital equipment” accounted for 55 percent of U.S. import value last year, which amounted to over $1 trillion in costs. U.S. tariffs and other import barriers increase the costs of production for U.S. companies, putting them at a disadvantage vis‐​á‐​vis foreign firms in the U.S. market and abroad.



But America’s competitors aren’t sitting still. Over the past two years, the Canadian and Mexican governments unilaterally slashed tariffs on a host of industrial inputs to reduce production cost and boost the competitiveness of their producers. Small and mid‐​sized businesses were reported to be enthusiastic about the tariff cuts, which will cut costs and paperwork. By 2015, the only goods subject to import duties in Canada will be supply‐​managed goods in the agricultural sector and some consumer products.



And in Mexico, in an effort to “reduce business operating costs, attract and retain foreign investment, raise business productivity, and provide consumers a greater variety and better quality of goods and services at competitive prices,” the Mexican government initiated a plan in 2007 to unilaterally reduce tariffs on 70 percent of the items on its tariff schedule. Those 8,000 items, comprising 20 different industrial sectors, accounted for about half of all Mexican import value in 2007. When the final phase of the plan is implemented on January 1, 2013, the average industrial tariff rate in Mexico will have fallen from 10.4 percent to 4.3 percent.



Among the major differences between the U.S. tariff liberalization and those in Canada and Mexico is that the U.S. action is temporary and only applicable to industrial inputs if there is no producer interest that objects. Our bolder North American neighbors have instituted permanent liberalization across the spectrum so as to afford their producers lower costs and an operational environment of greater business certainty.



On tariffs and other reforms that could encourage business investment and hiring, U.S. policymakers have a lot to learn from the actions of our trade partners.

As most of you know, the Nobel Peace Prize Committee in Oslo recently announced its decision to award it to the EU. That makes NoTricksZone one of the first Nobel Prize climate websites.
As you will all recall, the Committee awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to Al Gore and the IPCC in 2007. IPCC scientists, such as Drs. Michael E. Mann and Kevin Trenberth, are therefore “laureates”, at least that’s what some of the world’s leading climate authorities claim.

"**Memes, often in the form of humorous images and videos, are a major part of how people communicate on the internet, but they can also be used to spread disinformation.**
We've been looking at how these memes can present false and misleading information about Covid-19 vaccines, feeding into concerns about their efficacy or safety.
A popular meme - including images from rapper Drake's Hotline Bling music video - popped up in a number of local and community online forums in the UK and US this week - spreading false claims that a vaccine will modify our genetic code (DNA).
It also says the recovery rate from the disease is 99.97% - suggesting getting the disease is a safer option than a vaccine.
We've seen similar arguments against a Covid-19 vaccine shared across social media - asking why we need one at all if the chances of dying from the virus are so slim.
To begin with, the figure referred to in the meme as the ""recovery rate"" - implying these are people who caught the virus - is not correct.
About 99.0% of people who catch Covid survive it, says Jason Oke, Senior Statistician at the University of Oxford.
So around 100 in 10,000 will die - far higher than three in 10,000, as suggested in the meme.
However, Mr Oke adds that ""in all cases the risks very much depend on age and do not take into account short and long-term morbidity from Covid-19"" .
Without a vaccine, there will be many more infections - and therefore deaths - before enough people are immune to stop the spread. This is known as herd immunity - when a certain portion of the population have caught the virus.
It's not just about survival. For every person who dies, there are others who live through it but undergo intensive medical care, and those who suffer long-lasting health effects.
This can contribute to a health service overburdened with Covid patients, competing with a hospital's limited resources to treat patients with other illnesses and injuries.
Concentrating on the overall death rate, or breaking down the taking of a vaccine to an individual act, misses the point of vaccinations, says Prof Liam Smeeth of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. It should be seen as an effort by society to protect others, he says.
""In the UK, the worst part of the pandemic, the reason for lockdown, is because the health service would be overwhelmed. Vulnerable groups like the old and sick in care homes have a much higher chance of getting severely ill if they catch the virus"".
While mainly associated with humour, memes can also carry negative messages on emotive subjects.
Some of the most common memes about vaccines make it appear that a vaccine can have some radical side effects.
Images of disfigured people or creatures are shared alongside claims that they show the ""first person to receive the vaccine"" or captions saying that the jab ""didn't even hurt"".
It might seem obvious these images are not meant to be taken literally, but they are often shared in groups which are strongly opposed to vaccinations.
It's true that vaccines can have side effects, but these are mostly mild such as a sore arm, headache or a raised temperature for a day or two.
Vaccines go through rigorous safety checks before they can be administered to the public, with side effects closely monitored.
When memes have been appearing on social media feeds for months, some people start questioning if there's anything to these false or baseless claims.
""Memes like these can be disarming, because they tap into fears we all have about trust in science and medication side effects"" says Joan Donovan, a lecturer at Harvard University, and an expert on disinformation.
""Tying together negative messaging to pop culture can be especially memorable and drive people to share because the meme is funny, outrageous, or sticky (memorable).""
Another widely shared group of memes links falsehoods about vaccines to freedom and individual liberties.
One we've seen uses images of someone applying clown make-up, suggesting requirements for wearing a mask will be followed by an ""experimental vaccine"" and then an ""implantable microchip"".
Other posts seek to downplay the risks of coronavirus and suggest there is an ulterior motive behind the development of a vaccine.
Vaccines must meet a high standard of safety and effectiveness before they are approved for use - it's misleading to call them experimental.
As for the microchip rumour, we've debunked that before.
Another example suggests vaccines will lead to demands for people to surrender their firearms, and the confinement of people in ""virus relocation centres"". There is no evidence whatsoever to support these claims.
A recent report looking at the online conversation about vaccines in English, French and Spanish, found that the theme of liberty and freedom was more common in English, and particularly in the US.
Seb Cubbon, one of the co-authors of the report from anti-misinformation non-profit organisation First Draft, told the BBC this could be down to a number of factors, including America's political history and the relationship that citizens perceive they have with the state.
""As always, we should genuinely respect and appreciate people's views and opinions, such as the one that vaccines undermine personal freedoms"" he said.
""But the case can also be made that vaccines actually increase people's freedom to do things they otherwise wouldn't be able to, and can also contribute to safeguarding other people's personal freedoms too.""

 _Global Science Report_ _is a feature from the_ _Center for the Study of Science_ _, where we highlight one or two important new items in the scientific literature or the popular media. For broader and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly “Current Wisdom.”_   
  
The _Federal Register_ has been brimming with announcements of government activities aimed to reduce/regulate carbon dioxide emissions emanating from the United States.   
  
You may wonder why the government finds the need to pursue such action since 1) U.S. carbon dioxide emissions have already topped out and have generally been on the decline for the past 7-8 years or so (from technological advances in natural gas extraction and a slow economy more so than from already- enacted government regulations and subsidies); 2) greenhouse gases from the rest of the world (primarily driven by China) have been sky-rocketing over the same period, which lessens any impacts that our emissions reduction have); and 3) even in their totality, U.S. carbon dioxide emissions have a negligible influence on local/regional/global climate change (even a immediate and permanent cessation of _all_ our carbon dioxide emissions would likely result in a mitigation of global temperature rise of less than one-quarter of a degree C by the end of the century).   
  
We wonder the same thing. Nevertheless, the government has lots of ideas for how to save ourselves from ourselves (with likely to opposite outcome).   
  
Here is a summary of new announcements appearing in the _Federal Register_ over the past month or so on actions aimed to curtail our carbon dioxide emissions (primarily the result of our desire for cheap and reliable energy—gasp!).   
  
**Posted** **November 26, 2013** **:** The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) announced a call for review of the Technical Support Document currently justifying the Administration’s value of the social cost of carbon (SCC) used in federal cost/benefit analyses. We have discussed this announcement previously, and while it provides a glimmer of hope for injecting some new science and common sense into the government’s social cost of carbon, we are highly skeptical of a positive outcome. We mention the announcement again here, because the public comment period ends on January 27, 2014. Comments can be submitted here.   
  
**Posted** **December 6, 2013**: The Department of Energy announced another in its seemingly endless string of intrusions into our personal choices through its energy efficiency requirement updates for all sorts of consumer products. These revised efficiency regulations rely on the SCC to offset the costs and enrich the apparent benefits of the new requirements. We have already submitted comments on several of these proposed regulations (from walk-in refrigerators to furnace fans), but they just keep on coming. The latest pertains to commercial and electric motors. Final comments are due February 4, 2014 and con be submitted here.   
  
**Posted** **December 31, 2013**: The Department of Energy (DoE) announced that it has declined a Petition for Reconsideration of its rule updating the energy conservation standards for of microwave ovens. The Petition for Reconsideration was brought by the Landmark Legal Foundation which pointed out that the DoE used a social cost of carbon estimate in the cost/benefits analysis for the rule that had not been subject to public comment and which was some 50% higher than the value used in the C/B analysis that _was_ available for public comment. In other words, the DoE pulled a pretty big bait and switch. We at the Cato’s Center for the Study of Science submitted comments on the Landmark Petition pointing out just how far afield from the actual science that the Administrations SCC estimate had become. The denial was disappointing, but the fight over the proper value for the SCC has now moved to the OMB (as described above).



 **Posted** **January 8, 2014**: Last, but certainly not least, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced its new proposed rule “Standards of Performance for Greenhouse Gas Emissions From New Stationary Sources: Electric Utility Generating Units.” This is the second iteration of the EPA’s rule which effectively seeks to prohibit the construction of any new coal-fired power plants. The Administration/EPA made a big splash back in September when they announced the details of the plan to the press, but it didn’t clear all the necessary hurdles to make it official until last week. The public comment period on the major piece of intrusive legislation is only open for 60 days, ending on March 10, 2014 (comments should be submitted here). The EPA’s initial proposal limiting carbon dioxide emissions from new power plants, announced back in April 2012, received more than 2.5 million comments. When the EPA announced the new proposed rule, the EPA withdrew the old one and announced that it was not going to consider any of the comments submitted on the original proposal. This despite the fact the new proposed rule is grounded in the same (faulty) science as the original and has effectively the same impact on coal-plants. Substantially nothing changed, but the EPA is requiring a redo of the substantial effort that it takes to file comments on such a broad proposal.   
  
This is probably just the tip of the iceberg. Undoubtedly there will be major federal announcement to come of rules and regulations aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions—in fact, the Administration has already promised a proposal to limit CO2 emissions from _existing_ power plants. If you think the fight over regulations covering new power plants is contentious (with its 2.5 million comments and all), just wait until that one is proposed.   
  
We see busy times for us ahead!

"Westminster has failed to control rising electricity and gas prices. Between 1997 and 2013, UK households saw combined electricity and gas prices rise by 54% in real terms. In contrast, family income has fallen in real terms by approximately 7% over this period.  Little wonder  families are under financial pressure. And according to the charity Age UK, 20% of pensioners are being forced to reduce their energy bills by cutting back on heating their homes. The future could be even bleaker, with families and pensioners facing the very real possibility of blackouts in the next year or two. Both the industry regulator Ofgem and the Scottish government in its recent paper “UK energy policy and Scotland’s contribution to security of supply” have pointed to the looming danger of widespread power shortages across the UK. Ofgem in a report to be published later this month is very likely to highlight that spare electricity capacity has declined even further.   So why have Westminster and the power sector allowed this crisis to arise? The coalition government’s flagship initiative, electricity market reform (EMR), has failed lamentably to help protect electricity supplies. Ageing power stations are not being replaced fast enough and there has been a hiatus in energy infrastructure investment. The UK government’s rubbishing of the case for Scottish independence at every available opportunity seems to have contributed to a climate of market uncertainty, not least from its recent paper “Scotland analysis: energy”. Recent decisions by leading UK and international utility companies to restructure their portfolios and cancel projects illustrates clearly the lack of market confidence.  The UK government’s more general coolness towards renewables is measured by the now well established Renewable Energy Country Attractiveness Index. Its most recent edition last month said, “the prospect of solar market reforms has sparked another period of uncertainty for developers and investors in the UK, pushing it down to sixth place [in the renewables rankings] below Canada.”  Westminster’s intention to curb solar power subsidies and to possibly abandon future UK onshore wind subsidies completely has heightened the risk of power shortages. If more developers and investors withdraw, it also risks increasing electricity prices in the face of supply shortages.   The irony is that both solar and onshore wind have established themselves as mature, clean and relatively cost-effective power options. Unlike the adverse public perception of fracking and nuclear power, opinion polls, including those produced by the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC), consistently show very high levels of public support for renewables. The upshot of these problem policies is that the UK will need large amounts of renewable electricity both to keep the lights on and to meet the 2020 green energy targets. One option would be to build more capacity in England and Wales, but as mentioned before, this is not on the coalition’s agenda. Assuming this doesn’t change, and it would take a long time if it did, the UK will have to get it from elsewhere. The situation is different in Scotland, where the large amounts of wind power capacity already mean that it has an electricity generating surplus of some 25%.  Within the union, this means that Scotland is preventing a bad situation from being worse. In 2012 Scotland exported 10,717GWh to England for example, plus another 2,179GWh to Northern Ireland. England also relied heavily on imports from its European interconnectors, which supplied 12,197 GWh that year. As National Grid said in its March report, “Getting more connected: the opportunity from greater electricity interconnection” that, “with the current programme of power station closures ongoing, and demand potentially picking up as economic growth returns, the need for imports is set to continue.”   The UK government has long threatened that in the event of a yes vote, it would source its electricity from France, the Netherlands and Ireland instead of Scotland, to the extent it was cheaper. Not only is it already relying on these European interconnectors for about 5% of its power, the argument goes that it will get more in future through plans to build new links over the next few years.  In reality, expanding this network further is fraught with difficulties. These include cost, planning, technical challenges and complex legal agreements. As Ofgem said last year, “Great Britain is not the only European country expecting de-rated margins to fall in the next six winters. France, Ireland, Germany and Belgium are also facing security of supply challenges.” So security of supply constraints are also becoming very prevalent in the markets that supply power via interconnectors. This will reduce what they can sell over the English Channel.   In all likelihood, a rump UK would have no choice but to buy Scotland’s electricity generating surplus of around 25%. The UK government is significantly underplaying the important role that Scotland’s electricity plays in keeping the lights on across the UK.  And while the English may baulk at effectively subsidising Scotland’s green power sector, there is the consolation that purchasing this spare power will actually make very good commercial sense for Westminster. Compared to both English offshore wind and new nuclear build, Scottish onshore wind is much cheaper. Carrying out the threat in the energy paper would be as clear a case of cutting off your nose to spite your face as one can imagine.  The coalition’s other panacea to the looming energy crisis has been to hail the birth of the next generation of new nuclear build –- but that doesn’t even begin to address the issue of imminent power shortages. Even one new nuclear plant is likely to be 10 years away.   A new generation of nuclear stations also requires hundreds of billions of pounds of financial investment – the experience with Hinkley Point C is that the government would potentially end up underwriting large proportions of these costs to bring its vision to life. Meanwhile the waste and decommissioning costs will raise electricity bills for households and business even higher. Already 42% of DECC’s annual budget is spent on the UK’s nuclear legacy. In short, to avoid blackouts and further electricity price increases, Westminster now needs to stop the political posturing and take preventative action by raising its commitment to renewables and accepting the importance of Scotland in the equation regardless of whether it chooses to vote for independence. Are we going to see this any time soon? Don’t bet on it. On this vital matter of national energy security, the government appears totally out of touch. "

"**A pub close to the border between tier two and three coronavirus restrictions must stay shut after lockdown.**
The Wharf Inn, in Welford, is in tier three Leicestershire but is just a matter of yards from Northamptonshire, which is in tier two.
Landlady Anna Raven said it was ""frustrating"" that she would only be able to serve takeaways instead of reopening from 2 December.
Harborough District Council said it had 'no choice' but to follow the rules.
The pub falls within Leicestershire County Council's area but has a Northamptonshire postcode.
The sign welcoming people to the Harborough District is directly on the other side of the road.
Being classed as tier two would have allowed The Wharf Inn to serve alcohol as part of a substantial meal until 23:00 GMT.
Ms Raven said she felt the new restrictions had been ""rushed through"" and did not take into account geographical subtleties.
""I don't think it's anything malicious. It's literally down to the speed of the red tape,"" she said.
""It's come in and they've had to apply it but they haven't considered these little foibles that exist around the country that can make a huge difference.
""To the government, it's not really a consideration at this time because they have so much else to deal with.
""But someone could have taken a little time to say, 'this is viable, we can let this happen and let them open their doors'.
""I'm not angry, just a little frustrated we couldn't resume service and claw back up the ladder to something relatively normal.""
A Harborough District Council spokesman said: ""Whilst we understand the frustrations of some businesses impacted by the restrictions, the council has no choice but to follow the current government restrictions which have been introduced.
""However we understand the government will be publishing its regulations next week which may provide further clarification regarding boundaries.""

The New Hampshire House of Representatives, the third largest legislative body in the world, voted yesterday to end the state’s participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative cap-and-trade program. The House voted 251-108 after less than 5 minutes of debate to repeal the law under which the state joined RGGI. A number of Democrats refused to attend due to other legislation voted the same day to declare state employees to be employed at-will rather than having collective bargaining rights.


Aimed at reducing the the greenhouse gas emissions in the region, the RGGI program is a coalition of 10 northeastern US states issuing their own carbon credits under a cap and trade program. Under the program, emitters must either reduce their emissions to a specified level or purchase credits from others at auction on cap and trade markets that carry the RGGI credits. Proceeds of the auction are ostensibly used to fund energy efficiency programs, however critics have complained that electric users are funding efficiency programs that don’t directly benefit them.
Governor John Lynch, a Democrat who supports the RGGI, says repealing the law would cost the taxpayers $6 million a year, while the state forfeits $12 million a year in funding.
NH belongs to a regional power pool that dictates electric rates paid by members. If NH quites RGGI, electric rates paid by residents would still carry costs included that represent carbon credits purchased by RGGI members that belong to the pool.
New Hampshire has one of the highest levels of electric production by nuclear and renewable energy sources in the country (53.1% of Net Generated MWh):

This month's issue of _Cato Unbound_ has drawn an extraordinarily hostile response from a couple of mainstream online publications. Writing at _Salon_ , Michael Lind inferred, mistakenly, that our interest in Seasteading and other radical libertarian projects was due to our disappointment that Republicans lost in the 2008 election. Because this issue was my idea, I feel I can speak effectively to the charge.   
  
As I see things, it was basically impossible to cast either John McCain or Barack Obama as a libertarian. Neither of them shared the policy goals of the Cato Institute to any appreciable degree. Speaking as a private individual, I didn't vote for either of them, and I don't regret my choice. I found both Democrats and Republicans profoundly unappealing this election cycle.   
  
This issue of _Cato Unbound_ was motivated solely by my desire to see one particularly radical branch of libertarianism publicly confront its critics. I wanted to see how well it could hold up. Whether it stood or fell, the issue would have served its purpose. Electoral politics had nothing to do with it.   




As our disclaimer makes clear, _Cato Unbound_ doesn't necessarily reflect the opinions of the Cato Institute. No endorsement is implied. Instead, we strive to present ideas and arguments that will be interesting to libertarians and also, if possible, to the general public.   
  
Sometimes this means soliciting opinions that are very, very far from the American mainstream, and also far from our own views. It was a proud day for me when a prominent climate change blog suggested that Hell had frozen over \-- because the Cato Institute had published a piece by Joseph Romm. But that's just the kind of place that _Cato Unbound_ has always tried to be. We court controversy.   
  
Some of Lind's harshest barbs were reserved for contributor Peter Thiel, and for his suggestion that, demographically speaking, women have tended to oppose libertarian policies: ****



According to Thiel, one problem with democracy is that women have the right to vote:



Since 1920, the vast increase in welfare beneficiaries and the extension of the franchise to women -- two constituencies that are notoriously tough for libertarians -- have rendered the notion of 'capitalist democracy' into an oxymoron.



What could more beautifully illustrate the pubescent male nerd mentality of the libertarian than Thiel's combination of misogyny with the denial of aging and death? _We had a nice John Galt libertarian paradise in this country, until girls came along and messed it up!_   
  
Thiel continues: 



In our time, the great task for libertarians is to find an escape from politics in all its forms -- from the totalitarian and fundamentalist catastrophes to the unthinking demos that guides so-called 'social democracy.'



After considering the possible mass migration (if that is not a contradiction in terms) of libertarians to cyberspace and outer space, he opts for Fantasy Island: 



The fate of our world may depend on the effort of a single person who builds or propagates the machinery of freedom that makes the world safe for capitalism. For this reason, all of us must wish Patri Friedman the very best in his extraordinary experiment.



Here's an idea. Thiel could use his leverage as a donor to combine the Seasteading Institute with the Methuselah Foundation and create a make-believe island where girls aren't allowed to vote and where nobody ever has to grow up. Call it Neverland. It would be easy for libertarian refugees from the United States and the occasional neo-Confederate to find it. Second star to the right, and straight on till morning.



Emphasis added. Owen Thomas at Gawker jumped to about the same conclusion, but with even more ad hominem.   
  
Yet Thiel's claim is not that women should be denied the vote. He writes only that women have tended to favor policies and candidates he opposes, and which he thinks are bad for the country. This seems -- to my mind at least -- regrettable, but also generally true. Thiel might have chosen his words more carefully, but it's still quite a logical leap from what he actually wrote to demanding the end of women's suffrage. _Of course_ women should be able to vote. It's ridiculous to suggest otherwise. We libertarians just need to do a better job of convincing them that voting in favor of individual liberty and free markets are the best choices they can make.   
  
Consider that a Democrat might complain that white evangelical Christians don't support enough Democrats, and that this works out badly for the country. No one would ever conclude that Democrats want to take away the votes of white evangelical Christians. We would all figure that they are just confronting a failure of practical politics, and perhaps trying to do better at realizing their particular vision of the world. That's what Thiel was doing too, albeit not via electoral politics. Something about libertarians, however, seems to demand that some people read us as uncharitably as possible.   
  
Seasteading proposes to create a demonstration of how a libertarian society might work. Its proponents believe that if it works, everyone will be drawn to it, including women. Will they succeed? I have some serious doubts, to be honest.   
  
That's why I set up this issue of _Cato Unbound_ , and why I think the discussion has been valuable.

"The discovery of a nearly complete fossil skeleton of a teenage girl in the Hoyo Negro submerged cave system in Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula provides new insight into the first people to inhabit the Americas at the end of the last ice age. Our knowledge of the appearance of the earliest Americans, called Paleoindians by anthropologists, their background and inherited traits is based on no more than 30 individual skeletons found in the entire North American continent. Most of these include only fragments of the entire skeleton, and only twelve have been directly dated. So the addition of any newly discovered Paleoindian skeleton constitutes a major find – the fact that this skeleton is nearly intact makes it very rare. Unfortunately, the preservation of collagen was extremely poor in these waterlogged bones, so indirect dating techniques had to be used. The authors, led by Jim Chatters, argue the skeleton’s age must be constrained by the timing of the sink hole’s inundation as sea levels rose. Using the uranium-thorium radiometric dating method on the calcite florets – mineral deposits – that accumulated on the exposed bones of the skeleton before the chamber filled with sea water, the skeleton is placed at a minimum age of around 12,000 years (+/- 200 years).  Radiocarbon ages on the skull’s tooth enamel suggest a calibrated age of 12,900-12,700 years, making her one of the oldest human finds in the Americas. So it appears that this teenage girl, which the dive team named Naia, fell into the sinkhole and died sometime between 12,000 and 13,000 years ago, just at the end of the last glacial period. What is interesting about Naia’s body, small at only 4ft 10ins and surrounded by the bones of sabre-tooth tigers, pumas, and other animals that shared her fate in the sinkhole over the centuries, is the ancient mitochondrial DNA extracted from a molar tooth. Mitochondrial DNA is genetic material that is inherited solely from the mother, and so can be used to trace hereditary genetic relationships. After genetic sequencing, the authors placed her DNA within the D1 subgroup of “haplogroup D”. A haplogroup is a section or group of sections of mitochondrial DNA collectively inherited from the mother. The D haplogroup is thought to have originated in Asia some 48,000 years ago, and is one of five found among Native American peoples, the others being A, B, C, and X. But this particular subgroup D1 occurs only in the Americas, and the discovery of this skeleton adds weight to what is known as the Beringia Standstill hypothesis. This holds that the original ancestral Native Americans were isolated genetically from other populations for thousands of years. The proponents of the hypothesis, Erika Tamm and colleagues, estimate that Asian and American mitichondrial DNA haplogroups diverged more than 25,000 years ago, but that the latter dispersed in the New World less than 15,000 years ago. The age of the skeleton from Hoyo Negro falls well within this chronology. Another intriguing aspect of Naia’s skeleton concerns her facial features and teeth. She like other Paleoindians, and unlike most contemporary Native Americans, had smaller, narrower skulls and sharply projected faces. This also supports the idea that all Paleoindians derive from the same source populations in Asia, via Beringia.  The late and noted anthropologist Christy Turner said of this theory in 1999 that the facial features and teeth of Paleoindian skulls he’d examined led him to believe that these people had an appearance unlike either their Asian ancestors, or their Native American descendants. In Turner’s view, these people “looked more like each other than they did anybody else”. This unusual facial appearance, unlike contemporary Native Americans or northeast Asians, has perplexed paleoanthropologists for decades, leading some people to suggest that the Paleoindians were perhaps descended from a European ancestor, or possibly the ancestors of the modern Ainu people of Japan. This is because some of the facial features seen on Paleoindian skulls are more similar to Caucasian features. These aspects of Paleoindian facial features were clearly preserved in Kennewick Man, a 7,000-year-old Paleoindian skeleton from Washington state discovered by Jim Chatters in 1996.  Instead, the differences between the cranio-facial features of modern Native Americans and Paleoindians are due to evolutionary changes that have come since the divergence of Beringians from their Asian ancestors, brought to America in subsequent waves of immigration.  Naia’s remains are key to explaining the Paleoindians’ unique facial appearance, and how they can be, despite their differences, both descendants of ancient Asian peoples, and the ancestors of most Native North American groups of today."
"City-dwellers consider cycling or walking to work to be part of a healthy routine. But latest studies on air pollution show that nanoparticles – unseen pollutants – are a major concern.  In the UK, the number of cyclists is increasing. It has been dubbed the  “Wiggo effect”, following the success of British cyclist Bradley Wiggins at the 2012 Olympics. But to make sure the Wiggo effect provides the health benefits cycling promises, better urban planning is needed to protect cyclists from polluted air. New research from our group, published in the journal Atmospheric Environment, shows that a simple solution to the problem could be building green roadside corridors of vegetation. Air pollution takes different forms. Nanoparticles, those smaller than 100 nanometre (billionth of a metre) in diameter, are of great concern from a health perspective. Their small size allows them to enter deep into the respiratory system and reach other parts of the body.  Road vehicles are a major source of nanoparticles. While humans can tolerate exposure to nanoparticles to a certain limit, cyclists and pedestrians risk exposure beyond that limit. A report from the Health Effects Institute suggested these particles could be inhaled more deeply into the lung and might be more toxic than larger particles. This is simply because these particles remain suspended in the air longer and they are able to penetrate and deposit in the respiratory systems. What makes matters worse is that harmful organic compounds, which would have otherwise passed through the system, stick to these particles because of their large surface area per unit volume. The number of deaths caused by nanoparticles exposure is hard to estimate, but a recent review study published an estimate of Asian cities. These estimates suggest that in 2010 in Delhi about 1900 deaths per million were caused by traffic-related nanoparticle exposure alone. Similar or worse air pollution conditions can be expected in all the ten other Asian megacities in 2010 and assuming similar mortality rates in Asian megacities to those in Delhi, rough estimates suggest 310,000 deaths per year. Whether the level of exposure to nanoparticle pollution is harmful depends broadly on two factors: air pollution concentration, and the level of physical activity of the person breathing. The more physical exertion, the more air we take in. Cycling is an intensive activity where breathing rates can be more than 30% higher than during walking. If we take the example of a 42km road race using the typical concentrations of nanoparticles obtained from our study, the exposure doses of nanoparticles experienced by cyclists for covering this distance could be 65% higher compared with walkers who cover the same distance with the benefit of a green corridor. Trees help in cleaning our environment by acting as a sink for air pollution and producing fresh oxygen for us. What has been less clear until now is whether it matters where this urban vegetation is planted. When trees are planted along roadsides where there are densely packed buildings around them, they can actually trap pollutants by restricting their removal. Instead, when trees and vegetation are planted along the roadsides in non-built environments, such as along open busy roadsides or highways, they are effective at restricting pollutants from reaching footpaths.  Our research supports this finding, and demonstrates the effectiveness of roadside vegetation barriers to reduce nanoparticle pollution by at least one-third. If these green barriers are placed alongside the busy open roads, these can restrict freshly-emitted air pollution, including nanoparticles, and stop them reaching footpath users, cutting down exposure to appreciable levels. Most cities worldwide are facing the issue of air pollution with high nanoparticle exposure, a common phenomenon. Cutting emission exposure by more than a third just by utilising already available resources is an intelligent way to make a big difference. That is the least we can do to ensure cycling brings the promised health benefits."

"**Mass testing plans in England threaten to be a ""distraction"" from other priorities such as the rollout of a vaccine, health leaders have warned.**
The PM has said mass community testing, as seen in Liverpool, will be offered to all areas in tier three after lockdown ends.
But experts have questioned whether this is possible due to the ""enormous"" resources it requires.
The government said it will work with local authorities to support plans.
In a joint statement, the Faculty of Public Health and the Association of Directors of Public Health said improving NHS Test and Trace must remain the top focus for testing.
Mass testing of people without symptoms using new rapid ""lateral flow"" tests - which give a result in about 20 minutes, without the need for a lab - has been piloted in Liverpool.
So far more than 100,000 people without symptoms have been tested using the new rapid tests, with just over 700 positive results.
Now thousands of rapid tests have been sent to more than 90 local authorities in England as part of an expansion of the Liverpool scheme, which was supported by 2,000 members of the military.
One of those is Liverpool's neighbour, the borough of Sefton, which has half as many residents.
But the area says it only has a team of 12 people to carry out mass testing and has been offered no other support.
The Faculty of Public Health and the Association of Directors of Public Health said: ""The additional capacity provided to Liverpool to set up and manage testing sites alone has been enormous and it is difficult to envisage how or even whether this could be replicated at the pace being proposed across the country.
""This threatens to be a distraction from other activities, like planning and rolling out vaccines.""
Their statement added: ""The key priority needs to be targeted community testing... in settings or locations of higher risk of transmission or where the consequence of infection is higher.""
The government is asking local leaders and directors of public health in tier three to put forward proposals and said it will work with them to make sure they're resourced.
It said it is not expecting to see Liverpool replicated up and down the country.
Liverpool's mass testing pilot began earlier this month. Prof Louise Kenny, pro vice chancellor at Liverpool University, which is running the pilot scheme with the city council, said they were delighted with the results.
""It was a pilot, we had very few expectations about how it would turn out. But I'm really pleased by how the city has embraced it from all corners,"" she said.
""Yes, it's been lower in some areas but we're addressing that by making the testing more available, we assess what the barriers are, that's a work in progress.
""And I think the fact that we have identified over 700 of our residents who were positive, didn't know it, were at risk to their fellow citizens is a hugely encouraging thing."""

Not a day goes by without the publication of an **illogical rant** by some unhinged politician of the Left. These poor deluded creatures, deceived by their own beliefs, are only succeeding in making themselves the laughing stock of normal thinking people. 



Unfortunately, much of what they have to say is no laughing matter. On subjects such as economics, religion or society they spout a narrative that is born out of ignorance, hate, racism, and ideology. They harbour the fanciful thought process whereby **hate speech is enunciated by everyone but themselves,** when in fact the opposite is true.



The problem these people on the Left have is that most of their hateful rhetoric is ideologically driven. **Beliefs held based on ideology rely on basic assumptions about reality that may or may not have any factual basis.** Think Marama Davidson, Golriz Ghahraman and Julie Anne Genter for starters! These lunatics don’t pay any attention to reality or facts, they are just hell-bent on spouting their dogma which is anathema to rational people. They are so blinded to their philosophies that all logical thought becomes non-existent.



This modus operandi in the sense we are talking, if left unchecked can have dangerous elements. Some examples:



 **Economically** it’s all about the policies of redistribution, screwing the so-called rich pricks, many of whom in reality aren’t, with no thought that eventually, you will run out of other people’s money.



 **Climate Change** is where the fear element is introduced. Scare the living daylights out of impressionable young people with a load of unproven nonsense that we’ll all be dead in twelve years. Brainwash them to the point where they take it upon themselves to play truant for a cause on which they haven’t been given a balanced viewpoint. Julie Anne then informs us that this is our World War 2 moment. You have to be seriously ignorant and plain potty to come up with that comparison.



 **Religion** is where these demented marketers of hate are at their venomous best. Golriz would have us believe that Jesus was a Palestinian refugee, an idea it appears, she got from two of her left-wing sisters in America namely Ilhan Omar and Linda Sarsour. The fact that this is **patently not true** is of no concern to these ideologically driven personages. Obviously, the nonsensical point here is to have us believe that the Jews are not a race of people and that Judaism is simply a religion. The Left is anti-Semitic the world over while denying that they speak the language of hate.



 **Freedom of Speech** including hate speech is fine, providing you follow the rules of the Left which ironically are all about hate, anger and ridiculous assertions which have no truth in reality.



Perhaps the one thing that takes the cake is the madwoman Ocasio-Cortez, who managed to insult virtually the whole world by claiming camps on America’s southern border were akin to Nazi concentration camps. A statement that is breathtaking in its ignorance and stupidity. Was a bartender, now more of a barbarian it seems.



The Left today is nothing more than demented, deluded and deranged jackasses with **a dangerous agenda based on numerous falsehoods.** They are aided and abetted by equally dangerous organisations such as the United Nations and the European Union.



As Margaret Thatcher said – Left-wing zealots have often been prepared to ride roughshod over due process and basic considerations of fairness when they think they can get away with it. For them, the end always seems to justify the means. That is precisely how their predecessors came to create the gulag.



Begone! Enough is enough!

I have been worried that the social cost of carbon was a concept a bit too esoteric to grab the public’s attention despite the vast importance that it may play in our daily lives. I have heard it described as “a little wonky” and “difficult for a mainstream audience.”   
  
But my worries have been alleviated a bit with yesterday’s article in the _Wall Street Journal_ by Keith Johnson.   
  
The social cost of carbon, or SCC, is the current dollar amount that is assigned to the future damage that each emitted ton of carbon dioxide from human activities (mostly energy-related) is purportedly going to cause. (For a broader discussion of ""social costs,"" see here.)   
  
Johnson hits the nail on the head in summarizing the significance of the SCC:   




The number is important because the more costly carbon pollution is deemed to be, the greater the apparent economic benefits of new environmental regulations. The climate plan hinges on such regulations, including restrictions on new power plants that the Environmental Protection Agency is set to release in late September.



As I and others (including Johnson in the _Journal_ article) have pointed out, there are so many variables whose values are unknown (or unknowable) involved in its determination that the SCC can be set at virtually any value that the user desires it to be.   




The most prominent user is the Obama administration which has introduced the SCC into the cost-benefit analysis that must be performed for all proposed rules and regulations. Since this administration seems to like issuing rules and regulations—especially when they can be claimed to mitigate human-caused climate change—it prefers the value of the SCC to be high so that the supposed “benefits” that accrue through any carbon dioxide emission reductions that the new regulations may engender can be used to offset the actual costs that will result from the new rules.   
  
But just how the administration justifies the determination of a high value of the SCC is a matter of growing debate.   
  
To try an insure that the SCC isn’t (mis)used before the debate can be settled (although there are signs that they are too late), the U.S. House of Representatives, in one of its last actions before recess, passed a bill which limited the administration’s use of the SCC. My concern was that this is where the matter would stop as the initial indications were that the Senate probably wouldn’t address the topic and that the president would veto it anyway.   
  
But with yesterday’s _Journal_ article and a newly announced open round of public comments on a Petition for Reconsideration of the Department of Energy’s use of the SCC, perhaps the matter will continue to grow in the public’s conscience.   
  
And it should, because the administration’s determinations of the SCC is extremely squirrely, to say the least. I recently wrote:   




The administration’s SCC is a devious tool designed to justify more and more expensive rules and regulations impacting virtually every aspects of our lives, and it is developed by violating federal guidelines and ignoring the best science.



The more people know about this, the better.

"**Rapid Covid tests will be introduced in an area previously dropped from the mass testing programme.**
Redcar Council has received 10,000 lateral flow tests, which are able to produce results in under half an hour.
A pilot to offer tests to Redcar's 36,000 residents did not go ahead and now the authority is in talks over the cost of reintroducing it.
Councillor Steve Kay said the 10,000 rapid tests would help protect the ""most vulnerable"".
All councils in the Tees Valley have been offered the opportunity for residents to take part in mass testing.
But some councillors were concerned about who would pay for it, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.
Redcar and Cleveland Council leader Mary Lanigan said an initial proposal for local authorities to staff testing stations with their own volunteers was ""unacceptable"".
Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen asked whether there would be support from the Army or other resources.
""Following a conversation with council leaders they agreed they want me to go back to Matt Hancock and say we want the mass testing, but we do need the resources and the finances to run it,"" he said.
The Department of Health and Social Care has been approached for comment.
Mr Houchen also raised concerns about whether people would agree to be tested with the risk of having to self-isolate over Christmas.
Talks are expected to continue next week.
Two testing sites at the Inspire 2 Learn Car Park on Normanby Road, South Bank and the Kirkleatham Walled Garden in Redcar will be joined by a third due to open in Guisborough in December.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAnthony Watts this week posted twice on Michael Mann’s seemingly indignant (over)reaction to people criticizing his work here and here.

Dr. Michael Mann feels industry and skeptic scientists are out to get him, and that the world’s climate is on the verge of catastrophe. Source: climatedepot.com/
From the shrillness and combativeness of his tones, one might get the impression that he may have never gotten past the emotional level of potty training. Sadly the behavior of some of his climate scientists is equally discouraging. For example, alarmist scientists have recently reached new levels of creativity when it comes to making up stories to explain away the growing body of observations contradicting the claims of runaway warming. Many of these scientists avoid good climate news like Superman avoids Kryptonite. One has to ask if this unrelenting insistence and obsession with imminent global climate catastrophe is a normal state of mind.
As news, data, and observations pour in from all over the world suggesting that the scenarios of global warming catastrophe are totally wrong, is it normal to greet such findings with hostility of the kind we’ve been seeing? And is it a healthy state of mind that has one altering the recorded temperature measurements from the past until they produce the curve that agrees with catastrophe scenarios, as James Hansen has been doing?
Is it psychologically normal to attribute record cold and snow to a cooling that is caused by global warming?
So with all this going on, should our suspicions about Michael Mann’s state of mind be laid to rest when he constantly claims being the “target of a witch hunt”, of having “received a number of anonymous death threats“, or being the target of “a destructive public-relations campaign being waged by fossil fuel companies, front groups, and individuals aligned with them“? Michael Mann seems to have developed an incredible blindness to real causes. Forget his ego, which has him thinking the world is out to get him.
There’s a reason, Dr. Mann, why your integrity has been forcefully attacked and damaged. It stems in part from your misleading, sloppy, hockey stick science, but foremost from your own pig-headed refusal to fess up. People normally just don’t react amicably when others attempt to force a false reality upon them.

Contrary to what you believe, your “hockey stick” is in no way that “icon in the climate-change debate, providing potent, graphic evidence of human-caused climate change.” Rather it has become in the climate science community the icon of shoddy, misleading and disingenuous science. This has been clearly demonstrated by McKitrick and McInytre, von Storch, Soon, and others, and then confirmed by the National Academy of Sciences AND by the leaked climate e-mails in which your own colleagues ridiculed it.
Your refusal to accept this harsh reality is the very source of your soiled public integrity, and it’s only going to get much worse until you do come to terms with it. It really is time for you to close this sorrowful chapter, one which you yourself have authored.
Your harshest critics are not being driven by the fossil fuels industry. It’s your own obstinate behavior that is fueling the hurricane-force criticism that you are now finding too tough to face. Your obsession with the fantasy of fossil fuels destroying the the planet is mostly irrational and appears to some as borderline paranoia.
“My plight is dramatic.”
Indeed it is. And we really do hope you’ll get the help you need – and soon.

Last week, Energy Secretary Steven Chu said the U.S. should be open to slapping tariffs on imports from countries that fail to implement their own carbon reduction policies. Meanwhile, China has threatened trade war if faced with carbon duties, which it says are illegal under World Trade Organization agreements.



Trade restrictions tend to leave all involved poor, making trade war a frightening prospect during an already immiserating recession. So how did we come to have the Energy Secretary provoking threats of mutually destructive trade sanctions?



Here’s how. Either all the big, carbon‐​intensive economies reduce their emissions, or there’s little chance of reducing warming. If the climate modelers are right, we’ll all be better off if everyone pitches in. But each has an incentive to hold out, since countries that don’t pitch in will enjoy lower energy costs and a competitive advantage in international markets.



Chu rightly points out that Obama’s proposed cap and‐​trade scheme will put American manufacturers at a relative disadvantage. So how do we avoid this, and make sure countries like China don’t get a leg up?



In short, we can’t. There is no mechanism, no global government, to compel compliance. And it is dangerously naive to think that China, who is the world’s largest owner of dollar‐​denominated assets, is in a weaker bargaining position than the U.S. We poke the dragon at our peril.



Cap‐​and‐​trade is sure to raise costs for struggling American consumers. But it won’t much reduce warming unless countries like China and India fall in line. Yet neither the U.S. nor Europe can just force this to happen. If we try by imposing carbon duties, we’ll hurt consumers even more by raising the cost of imports, and possibly start a trade war no one will win.



Chu’s remarks highlight the fact that cap‐​and‐​trade is a costly, risky gambit. But now’s not the time. Suffering workers and consumers can’t afford to lose again.

"When Hurricane Sandy struck New York in 2012, it was a brutal wake up call for the Big Apple.  That call should have also been heard by the citizens of every other coastal city and those responsible for ensuring their safety – though there is little evidence that it has.  Sandy was the largest ever recorded Atlantic hurricane and, after Katrina, the second most costly, causing damage of around US$70 billion in the US alone. Hundreds of people were killed and hundreds of thousands made homeless along the storm’s path through the Caribbean, US, and Canada. But while 24 US states were affected, it was the inundation of Lower Manhattan that generated the largest shock waves.  The death, destruction and general havoc wreaked by Sandy laid bare the inadequacies of current approaches to coastal flood risk management, generating a storm of public outrage. Hurricane Katrina’s devastation of New Orleans in 2005 had been bad enough, but images of one of the world’s most iconic coastal cities being inundated by a storm surge despite several days advance warning were truly shocking. If it could happen to New York City, isn’t every other coastal community also at risk of catastrophic flooding? The scientific answer to that question is, of course, an emphatic yes.  The Rebuild by Design competition held to promote radical new approaches to protecting the city has now identified six winning projects, and it’s apparent that all are substantially based on using green and blue infrastructure to provide more natural and flexible defence than concrete walls. These defences work by mimicking the natural functions of coastal wetlands, woodlands, barrier beaches and offshore reefs in sapping the energy of waves and storm surges to reduce their height and rob them of destructive strength. Between storms, they provide a wide range of habitats necessary to support diverse ecosystems, providing leisure and commercial opportunities, including lost natural resources such as fisheries and oyster beds. The lesson from Sandy is that while there are good reasons why huge population centres have developed adjacent to and just a few feet above the ocean, living there involves flood risk – a risk that cannot be eliminated, but can, and must, be reduced to a level that is acceptable, or at least tolerable.  This applies not only to coastal cities in the US, but to every coastal conurbation and, especially, to Asian mega-cities. Easily said, but how can this be done?  It won’t be through business as usual, or even incremental changes to conventional flood risk management approaches. Following the European floods of the late 1990s and early 2000s, the UK government’s Flood Foresight paper reinforced the message that hard choices have to be made. It’s such a pity that, with subsequent severe flooding in Britain and elsewhere, from Australia to Zimbabwe, it seems the lesson has to be learned repeatedly and the hard way. The need for radical new thinking did not go unrecognised in New Orleans. But the understandable, though scientifically and socially flawed, decision to simply rebuild breached defences and devastated neighbourhoods prevailed. Proposals to re-locate communities away from highest risk areas and return the most vulnerable land to its previous role of providing natural flood protection were ignored. Even the Green NOLA design competition in 2006, which set out to deliver “visionary yet practical responses” to the city’s problems, lacked the backing it needed from the authorities. But the Rebuild by Design competition is different to that in New Orleans. It has the backing of the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, which gives the winning designs a real chance of being built. The designers seem to have engaged directly with communities and business owners at risk to find solutions that are not only radical, but which reflect the preferences of the people who will live and work around them every day.    It is an uncomfortable truth that the level of flood defence that can be provided to a community is limited by the value of the assets at risk. The solution has to make sense economically, which is why London is protected against a one-in-a-thousand-year flood, while Hemsby on the Norfolk coast is economically undefendable. In Lower Manhattan, not just densely packed public housing, iconic buildings, and infrastructure such as the subway and electricity sub-stations are at risk, but Wall Street itself. This explains why there’s substantial funding available to provide protection against another Sandy-sized surge. The winning concept for Lower Manhattan, a green design that includes parkland and a banked earth flood wall around the tip of the island named the “Big U”, is costed at US$335m – a considerable sum but easily justified when compared to what’s at risk.  The aim of using blue-green infrastructure in place of the old fashioned grey kind is to recreate a naturally-oriented water cycle that contributes to the amenity of the city by bringing together water and environmental management. This is achieved by combining and protecting the hydrological and ecological values of the urban landscape while providing resilient and adaptive measures to deal with flood and drought events. In this spirit, the Big U creates publicly accessible green spaces that will deliver social, economic and environmental benefits even when the defences are not keeping out storm surges, which is of course most of the time. The project’s other great advantage is that it’s adaptable. Not only will it provide protection now, it also allows for a planned retreat from the coastline should that be necessary in future. This could be the case if, for example, melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet drives a larger than expected rise in sea level: unlikely, but not impossible.  But what about neighbourhoods not home to a global financial hub? Neighbouring communities on Staten Island and in Hoboken, New Jersey, are typical of dozens of ordinary towns and cities along the east coast affected by Sandy. While in sight of Manhattan, they are in different leagues, economically.  They too were considered in Rebuild by Design, leading to five winning projects for other areas around the coasts of New York City and New Jersey, and running the total cost up to around US$1 billion. According to Rebuild by Design, Staten Island merits US$60m of investment in Living Breakwaters and artificial reefs that provide sustainable coastal defence while restoring the valuable shoreline and marine ecosystems previously sacrificed to conventional concrete sea walls.  On the other hand Hoboken is envisaged as a Resiliency District where, by reducing the vulnerability of homes, businesses and infrastructure to flooding that cannot be prevented economically, it is hoped public-private finance will step in to support badly needed urban renewal. The initial cost of US$230m is affordable, but is just the start, and building a resilient community will require concerted, long-term investment by government and local businesses, which makes the future for Hoboken rather less secure than that of Lower Manhattan, or even Staten Island.  The Rebuild by Design competition has produced worthy winners that address current flood risks effectively and affordably, while leaving space for adaptation to an uncertain future, recreating lost habitats and providing public green spaces of considerable socio-economic value. The winning solutions are sustainable in that they use science responsibly to conceive radical solutions that offer economic security while greening the urban landscape and restoring shoreline environments.   But the jury is still out on whether even these radical new approaches can deliver these benefits in ways that are socially equitable. In practice, this will depend more on good governance than creative engineering, something outside the scope of any design team. Achieving social justice in flood risk management relies on the willingness of people not just to get involved but to stay involved long after the damage of the trigger event has been repaired and the trauma, though dreadful, has passed.  If Rebuilding by Design can lay the foundations for long-term community engagement in managing flood risk in New York and New Jersey it will fully deserve all the plaudits it looks likely to receive."
"**Discussions have been taking place about whether the Christmas school holidays could be extended in Scotland.**
It has been suggested that the dates could be standardised across the country, with all schools closing on 18 December and reopening on 11 January.
Holiday dates vary between different council areas, with most schools due to return between the 5 and 7 January.
The proposal is designed to limit the spread of Covid after families get together for Christmas.
The issue was discussed at the Scottish government's education recovery group, but no decisions have yet been made.
The group brings together a number of stakeholders in the education sector, including unions, councils and the government.
A document from Thursday's meeting was leaked to the Daily Record newspaper.
The memo says the government is considering a national extension to the holidays, with schools either remaining closed or introducing remote learning for a temporary period.
At the daily briefing, Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said the Scottish government was very conscious that parents, teachers and pupils wanted to know what was going to happen.
""We will make sure that we reach a view based on the advice from that expert recovery group, and make sure that we reach a view as soon as we can so that people do have advance notice,"" she said.
""We want to give people as much notice as possible if there is to be any change at all, but at this point that decision hasn't been reached.""
Ms Freeman said it would be wrong to ""overly speculate or jump to conclusions"" just because they were looking at the issue.
""The deputy first minister (John Swinney) and his colleagues will be working through what they think is the best way for schools to enter the Christmas break and come out of the Christmas break - and that applies to colleges and universities as well,"" she added.
There are a number of important issues to be discussed about changing the holiday dates.
First of all parents will want clarity - changes to the dates could mean people having to arrange childcare or take time off work.
Secondly, if schools return a few days later than planned in January, some secondary schools may want to change prelim dates.
Thirdly, councils are protective of their role in the education system. They would want to ensure any standardisation of dates in an emergency does not set a precedent.
And there is, of course, also the question of whether an extended school holiday would by itself make any meaningful difference to the efforts to control coronavirus.
The BBC understands councils will discuss the matter again on Friday.
It is expected that the education recovery group will meet on Wednesday to discuss the potential impact on exams, and that a decision could be made on the holiday extension next week.
While many schools are already due to close on 18 December, others are set to remain open until 23 December. The dates for returning to school in January also vary.
The memo says that extending the holidays would act as a break following the relaxation of rules over the festive period.
However, concerns are raised over the time needed to set up the remote learning, and the potential impact caused by the loss of emergency childcare which had previously been provided by school staff.
School holidays have traditionally varied in different council areas across Scotland, but the start of the autumn term was standardised in August as schools reopened for the first time since March.
Scottish Greens co-leader Alison Johnstone told the BBC's daily briefing programme that parents and pupils needed clarity on extending the Christmas school holidays.
""We have learned about this today through a leak to a newspaper so I think transparency and clarity are key here,"" she said.
The Scottish Conservatives' education spokesman Jamie Greene said any further ""watering down"" of pupils' time in class would need to be ""properly catered for at home"".
He added: ""Every child should have access to proper IT equipment and learning materials to ensure they don't fall behind with their studies.""

There has been a flurry of articles and op‐​eds over the past few weeks about how President Donald Trump has supposedly engineered a dramatic departure from the liberal world order that the United States has led for roughly seventy years.



An _Associated Press_ story explained, “on a broad range of foreign policy matters, Trump has steadfastly refused to adopt conventional approaches, straining decades‐​long alliances, refusing to condemn authoritarian regimes on human rights abuses and escalating the rhetoric in a nuclear stand‐​off with North Korea.”



In a _Washington Post_ op‐​ed that focused mostly on Trump’s autocratic tendencies at home, Joe Scarborough also lamented Trump’s praise “of autocrats across the world as they were ruthlessly consolidating power in countries such as Russia, China and the Philippines.”



The _New York Times_ ’ Mark Landler offered up one of the more thoroughgoing assessments, contending that:



 _Mr. Trump has transformed the world’s view of the United States from a reliable anchor of the liberal, rules‐​based international order into something more inward‐​looking and unpredictable. That is a seminal change from the role the country has played for 70 years, under presidents from both parties, and it has lasting implications for how other countries chart their futures._



On closer inspection, these assessments seem overwrought. President Trump has not abandoned U.S. allies in Europe and Asia. On the contrary, he allowed Montenegro’s admission to NATO to go forward, the first new member in ten years. Last month, he backed the sale of weapons to Ukraine’s government as it struggles to put down a Russia‐​backed insurgency. He increased the number of U.S. troops in Europe. None of these decisions advance U.S. security—arguably, they undermine it—so it is hardly consistent with what most Americans think of when they hear “America First.” What’s more, these actions provide little evidence that Donald Trump is overly solicitous of Vladimir Putin, or particularly mindful of Russia’s geopolitical insecurities.



In Asia, most Americans have focused on the deepening crisis over North Korea’s nuclear program and Donald Trump’s war of words with Kim Jong‐​un. In practice, however, Trump has not significantly departed from the status quo that he inherited. The U.S. Navy continues to operate extensively throughout the Asia‐​Pacific. There are still tens of thousands of troops in Korea and Japan, and the Trump administration has shown no signs of reducing that permanent presence, despite the president’s stated misgivings, and the dubious connection between such a presence and U.S. safety.





Trump’s Twitter rants and ill‐​considered off‐​hand comments have not made us, or the world, safer.



Meanwhile, across the Greater Middle East, Trump has expanded the air war against ISIS, Al Qaeda, violent extremists, or anyone, really, who might possibly pose a threat. The fact that many hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of innocent civilians have been killed in this campaign reflects a degree of callousness and indifference to human suffering, and is consistent with Trump’s rhetoric during his campaign. Barack Obama, and George W. Bush before him, justified occasional “collateral damage” in the service of the Global War on Terror as an unfortunate side‐​effect of the necessary use of force.



Lastly, on the question of whether Trump has broken sharply with the foreign policy elite or affirmed that elite’s preferences, let’s not forget, Trump expanded the U.S. ground presence in Afghanistan, despite the fact that he had repeatedly questioned the wisdom of continuing the war. In the end, both Landler and AP reporters Jonathan Lemire and Zeke Miller admit that Trump didn’t depart from the national security establishment’s collective wisdom that the war—already seventeen years old—should continue indefinitely.



In short, Trump’s rhetoric suggests that he is willing to abandon primacy—America’s de facto foreign policy for the past several decades—but his actions largely affirm the status quo, which makes him indistinguishable from his predecessors in a number of critical respects.



If you are skeptical, ask yourself: would Hillary Clinton have withdrawn troops from Afghanistan, wound down the drone war, or blocked NATO expansion or the Ukrainian arms sale?



I doubt it. Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.



To be sure, Donald Trump _has_ pushed through a number of changes to U.S. foreign policy that neither Obama nor Clinton would have (e.g. withdrawal from the Paris climate accord; reversal on better relations with Cuba; threats to undo the Iran nuclear deal; calls for recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital). Indeed, if there is a single theme connecting his disparate actions it seems to be “If Obama did it, it must be wrong.” But, on matters of substance, and particularly with respect to the U.S. global military posture, Donald Trump hasn’t changed that much.



So, why all the fuss? Because Trump _is_ different. Words matter, and Trump’s Twitter rants and ill‐​considered off‐​hand comments have not made us, or the world, safer.



Unsurprisingly, U.S. allies in Europe and Asia have questioned, and at times openly defied, Washington’s dictates. “We’re beginning to see countries take matters into their own hands,” observes Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations. “They’re hedging against America’s unreliability.”



We might ask, “What took so long?” The U.S. liberal global order was never as liberal as advertised (consider Washington’s support for illiberal dictators and perilous partners during the Cold War and since). It was mostly focused on a few favored allies, and excluded those we didn’t like (so, not exactly global). And it wasn’t even that orderly (the disastrous Iraq War, after all, resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths, millions of refugees and destabilized an entire region). The rules, meanwhile, applied to others, not to us. It was unrealistic to think that it could last indefinitely, especially when the American people are desperate for something different.



We should be disappointed, therefore, that concerns about Trump and Trumpism haven’t prompted a more serious debate over the future of U.S. foreign policy. Instead we get lamentations that all is lost, followed by a forlorn hope to go back to the way it was before.

 _Global Science Report_ _is a feature from the_ _Center for the Study of Science_ _, where we highlight one or two important new items in the scientific literature or the popular media. For broader and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly “Current Wisdom.”_   
  
_\---_   
  
A new paper has been published in the journal _Geophysical Research Letters_ that examines trends in heavy rainfall amounts across the U.S. The paper is authored by Newcastle University’s Renaud Barbero and colleagues, and, to summarize, finds that the heaviest rainfall events of the year have been increasing in magnitude since 1951 when averaged across nearly 500 stations distributed across the U.S. (note: results from individual stations may differ from the general finding).   
  
Someone with a critical eye might ask the _real_ question, which is “how much?” That such a number does not jump out of this paper—a cynic would say—probably means it is very small. Read on and you will find the answer.   
  
That rainfall on the rainiest day of the year is increasing is, of itself, hardly surprising considering that the total annual rainfall amount averaged across the U.S. has also been increasing during this same period (again, results from individual locations/regions may (and do) depart from this generality).   
  
Changes in heavy rainfall like this are often luridly described as a “disproportionate increase” in extreme events, or that extreme precipitation increases are “worse than expected.”   




This is not the case—or at least wasn’t the case when we published a paper in the _International Journal of Climatology_ on this very subject back in 2004. In that paper we found the same thing that Barbero and colleagues found with regards to the heaviest daily rainfall events of each year—they were getting heavier. But, we were careful to note, that so too was the total yearly rainfall, and as a result, the increase of the heaviest daily rainfall events was _completely proportional to the increase in annual rainfall increase_. In other words, the increase on the wettest day each year was neither “disproportionate” nor “worse than expected.”   
  
In fact, this result was not a surprise at all. It’s basic climatology.   
  
Let’s have a look, and while we’re at it, we’ll update our old analysis (which ended with data from 2001) with data available from a new “extremes” dataset which runs through 2010.   
  
The “extremes” data set we’ll use is the one compiled by Markus Donat and colleagues and includes gridded data (3.75° longitude x 2.5° latitude grid) on annual daily rainfall extremes as well as data on annual total rainfall. This data is available using this handy on-line tool. We selected the region of interest as shown in Figure 1.   






_Figure 1. Study area used in this analysis._



Now, let’s look at the relationship between total annual rainfall and daily maximum rainfall for each year, averaged across the gridcells contained in our study area, as shown in Figure 2. Years with more total rain also have more rainfall on the wettest day of the year. This is no different during the first half of the 20th century (1901-1950; blue points) than it has been in the time since (1951-2010; red points). Any human-caused climate change (which should be more evident in the latter period) hasn’t led to a change in this general climatological relationship.   






_Figure 2. The average of the annual total precipitation (across the grids in the boxed area in Figure 1) plotted against the average of the annual daily maximum precipitation for two different time periods._



Let’s dig in a bit further. In Figure 3a (top) we plot the amount of precipitation falling during the wettest day of the year averaged across our study area. The data run from 1901-2010 and show a small, but statistically significant increase. Figure 3b (middle) shows the average total annual precipitation over the same period. Again, a slight and significant increase. And finally, Figure 3c (bottom) shows that the proportion of annual precipitation delivered during the wettest day of the year (Figure 3a divided by Figure 3b) exhibits no overall trend. In other words, the relationship between total rain and heavy rain remains unchanged. Each of these precipitation histories shows a good bit of temporal variation. If human-caused climate change is playing a role here, it is neither readily discernible nor resulting in unusual behavior.   






_Figure 3. (a, top) The daily precipitation on the wettest day of the year averaged across the region depicted in Figure 1, 1901-2010; (b, middle) The total annual precipitation averaged across the region depicted in Figure 1, 1901-2010; (c, bottom) the proportion of total annual precipitation delivered during the wettest day of the year, 1901-2010._



From Figure 3a we can also see the actual increase in the amount of rainfall falling on the rainiest day of the year. It’s just a tad more than one-tenth of an inch. We submit that that isn’t “extreme,” “disproportionate” or even “consequential.” It’s just a very small number. To emphasize to the point of ridiculousness, hold your thumb and index finger a tenth of an inch apart and imagine the horrific damage that this increase in rain must cause!   
  
In fact, if global warming has a hand in increasing annual precipitation totals, this would seem as a good thing (positive externality) considering the anticipated increase in water-use demand. According to a recent report from the Pacific Institute on our nation’s water-use trends:   




We conclude that considerable progress has been made in managing the nation’s water — but the current pace is not likely to counter the demands of continued population and economic growth, climate change, and increasing tensions over scarce water resources. National water use remains high, and many freshwater systems are under stress from overuse. While there is reason to believe this may be changing, we must continue efforts to improve water-use efficiency in our homes, businesses, and on our nation’s farms.



All of this confirms that our original finding from 2004 continues to remain valid and thus our conclusions from that paper are worth repeating:   




Our results support the contention that, where changes are significant, there is an increase in the amount of rain occurring on heavy rain days. However, our results provide no support for the argument that the increase in total annual rainfall observed across the USA is disproportionately occurring on the wettest days — a contention that may have arisen from methodological constraints rather than true changes in the nature of precipitation delivery…   
  
Our results argue strongly that the increase in rainfall in the coterminous 48 states that has been observed in the last 100 years has not resulted in any systematic disproportion in the percentage of that increase allocated to the heaviest rain days.



But then, as is the case now, the actual amount of the increase is so small as to be operationally meaningless, even if it were caused by emissions of dreaded carbon dioxide (a hypothesis that is rather difficult to prove). The same holds true for the large majority of other impacts from anthropogenic climate change—despite what you may read in the other media outlets.

"The European policies designed to encourage a more biodiverse environment that is better able to support wildlife and plants are failing. In fact, our analysis of the reforms designed to “green” the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) suggests they neither encourage greater wildlife abundance nor provide adequate protection for vulnerable habitats such as grasslands.  Finally adopted in March, the long process of reforming the CAP was supposed to require farmers to “observe practices beneficial to the climate and environment” in order to qualify for some of their direct payment subsidies, as well as offering pro-environmental farm stewardship as a voluntary step. While we depend upon the food grown in agricultural fields we also benefit from the environment to which they are a part, from the wildlife such as the iconic skylarks lauded by Vaughan Williams, or the “green and pleasant land” of a traditional, diverse rural landscape. Land given over to agriculture should produce more than just food and profits, but things of a wider worth to society.  The reformed CAP is an effort to recognise that we should pay farmers to produce both. Much of Northwest Europe’s farmland is now monotonous, monocrop farmland, degraded and denuded of its wildlife. Eastern Europe’s more traditional landscapes remain wildlife rich, and the policies’ green measures should help protect them, while encouraging farm modernisation. This is the aim but not, we discovered, the reality. In the UK, the Advertising Standards Agency (ASA)’s code on environmental claims says words such as “greener” can be justified if the advertised product provides a total environmental benefit over that of the marketer’s previous product, and the basis of the comparison is clear. Let’s apply this logic to the CAP reform. As part of a team of environmental and farming experts from across the EU, we analysed the “greening” credentials of the new CAP relative to the old one. Our results, published in the journal Science, reveal that, alarmingly, the reformed CAP fails the ASA test: there is no basis for claiming that it is greener. While many farmers across Europe have in the past volunteered to receive payments for the so-called “agri-environment schemes”, some of which have provided environmental benefits, this budget has shrunk by almost 20%. For the reformed CAP to increase its environmental benefit overall, any benefits lost as a result would have to first be replaced.  The reformed CAP introduces three measures: Ecological Focus Areas, in which 5% of agricultural land is managed to provide habitat for wildlife. Maintaining 95% of permanent grasslands, home to many wildflowers and the insects and birds they support, from being ploughed into fields. And the requirement to grow at least three crops on arable farms over 30 hectares in order to generate a more diverse landscape. Ecological Focus Areas will only work if they provide the right habitat for wildlife in the right place. But the scheme doesn’t include those interventions known to help wildlife, such as flowers planted for pollinators, or plots for ground-nesting birds.  And in any case, the payment rests on simply having them, rather than managing them in the right way or in the right place to make a difference. Management is critical to making any real difference – hedgerows, for example, are not much good for birds and insects if they are cut short every year and hardly allowed to flower. Fallow land is poor for wildlife if it is sprayed with herbicide in late spring to prevent weeds colonising crops. The measure designed to protect permanent grassland, doesn’t. A farmer can continue to collect the subsidy if they convert a patch of flower-rich meadow into an intensively-managed improved pasture field, because it is technically still “grassland”. If taken up, the 5% reduction allowable under the scheme will over the six-year lifespan of the current CAP represent more than double the rate of loss of permanent grassland that occurred between 1993 and 2011, when just over 6% of Europe’s grasslands were lost. As for the three crop rule, there is no evidence that having three crops, rather than two or one, provides any environmental or diversity benefit. It entirely depends on which crops are planted, and how they are managed – for example, what pesticides are used and when. Even now in half of EU member states the average arable farm already has four or five crops, so requiring three will not provide any additional environmental benefits. On top of it all, most European farmers and about half the farmed area are in any case exempt from Ecological Focus Areas and minimum crop diversity, because they don’t apply to livestock farms or small arable farms. The message that, after hard-won reform, the CAP is now greener is really appealing to society, so it’s particularly unfortunate that our analysis indicates that it is nothing of the sort. It’s important that national governments recognise that our evidence-based analysis indicates a shortfall between rhetoric and reality, and do what they can in their own power to improve matters.   It is also up to us, as citizens and consumers, to recognise that relying on food to be cheap and plentiful implies that sustainable farming will take second place.  If we don’t like this choice, it’s up to us to voice it."
"Everything is connected. It’s hard to imagine right now that, just weeks ago, the truism of ecological politics was treated as hippy nonsense by mainstream politics. Announcing the statutory review of the commonwealth’s Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (EPBC) last October, the Morrison government pitched it as an opportunity to weaken the Howard era laws even further and make it easier still for environmentally destructive projects to be approved. And, regardless of clear statements from scientists and strong advocacy by campaign groups, it looked like it would get away with it because, back then, we were still living in the age of disconnection when the environment and the economy could be seen as separate things, in competition with each other. But then the summer arrived, delivering one after the other two massive wake-up calls. In the age of consequences, with the climate crisis and a deadly pandemic bearing down on us, it’s impossible to pretend that we are separate from each other and from the natural world. A pandemic, more than almost any other phenomenon, shows that all our lives are inextricably intertwined, for now and forever, whether we like it or not. It brings into sharp focus the impossibility of trying to keep economics, health, environment, education and social justice treated as separate questions with separate answers. It heightens awareness of our vital need, as social beings, to stay connected to each other as well as we possibly can while keeping our physical distance. It shows how the “efficient”, on-demand world that capitalism has constructed is so incredibly fragile that a series of shocks can bring it to the point of collapse. And with the rules of neoliberal economics being broken by governments the world over, it demonstrates that massive policy interventions, shifting the entire structure of the global economy, are possible. With the complete focus right now on Covid-19, it takes an effort to cast our minds back to this summer’s bushfires. They were, of course, far larger and fiercer than ever before, over a season that started when we were barely out of winter. Where previously bushfires had affected a small number of people, this season the smoke blanketing Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne, and the repeated evacuation of summer holiday spots, meant that most Australians were affected. Covid-19, among other things, shows us the consequences of deregulating markets in health services, food supply and more This heralded a shift in thinking that went deeper than personal impact. Perhaps due to the remarkably low loss of human life compared with the scale of the disaster, there was a tremendous focus on the more than a billion mammals, birds and reptiles killed. We mourned the thousands of koalas and the numerous species being pushed towards extinction if their habitats aren’t restored. The true legacy of this summer could be a vital turning point in recognising that “the environment” isn’t something “over there”. The environment is the air we breathe and the water we drink; it’s the soil in which we grow our food; it’s the animals we identify with and the landscapes imprinted on our souls; the environment is us, all of us, together, integrally connected with everyone and everything else on this beautiful blue marble floating in space. Damage the environment and we damage ourselves. And not just some of us – all of us together. Continue to think in our compartmentalised, linear fashion, and we’ll keep missing what’s coming, be it weeks of smoke, runs on toilet paper, or deadly pandemics. What started to become clear thanks to the fires was rammed home by Covid-19. We are only as healthy as the least healthy among us. Everything we do relies on extraordinary networks of activity by people we’ve never met, crisscrossing the globe. And responding to a health crisis that was likely triggered in part by environmental destruction has world-changing impacts on the economy, on education, on social justice, on geopolitics. The age of disconnection is over. To bring us back to where we started, where does that leave the review of the EPBC Act? We have an opportunity now to not just push for a new generation of environment laws, but to re-evaluate the whole deal, to cultivate a new political settlement based on ecological principles of living well together in harmony with the natural world, understanding our place as part of it as First Peoples did for millenniums, with an economy designed to serve people and planet. As part of this, in the immediate term we need to advocate for vital improvements to the EPBC. It is extraordinary that the Howard legacy of deliberately excluding a project’s climate impacts from the triggers to require assessment still hasn’t been remedied. That must now be fixed, as must the fact that there is no mechanism for assessing the cumulative ecological impacts of various proposals. After this summer’s destruction of huge areas of remaining healthy ecosystems, we need to institute, in both legislation and the practice of assessment, a presumption of protection instead of a culture of managed destruction. All this will, of course, be attacked as “green tape” and we have to be ready to actively defend it instead of changing the subject – and defend it on ecological grounds. Regulation is a vital part of the connective tissue which holds the body politic together. Removing it sees us fall apart. Covid-19 is, among other things, showing us the consequences of deregulating markets in health services, food supply and more. Having that conversation in this way means we won’t just be advocating for marginal improvements, but will be working to change politics. We’ll be building into the political common sense the idea that corporations absolutely should be regulated to enforce environmental and social responsibilities, and that we can no longer consider shareholder profit to be their sole focus. That helps move our politics towards altering the DNA of corporations so they operate as part of the body politic rather than as cancer cells. The flip side of this systemic shift is to institute legal rights for the natural world. If BHP has legal rights, why shouldn’t the Great Barrier Reef? Rights of nature is an increasingly mature legal field, instituted from New Zealand to Bolivia, India to parts of the US. We can and should at least insert them as a normative principle in the goals of the EPBC. While we’re thinking at that level, a new ecological political settlement will need a rethink of federalism. Our system sees national and state governments cooperating to shut out community participation and scientific advice to facilitate destructive development. An effective regime based on a presumption of protection would see federal, state, territory and local governments enabling communities to collectively develop creative ideas at their local level, within the context of expert scientific advice, and coordinating those ideas at a regional and continental level. If we shift environmental regulation from a process that is primarily responsive to demands of developers into a proactive, constructive, community-led system, we can see it morph from a defensive protection stance into one of active restoration, repair and regeneration. It can lead to the greening of cities and towns as we embrace the fact that habitats are not just “over there” but among us. It can create industrial jobs in coalmine rehabilitation. It can support regenerative agriculture, and cooperative sharing of scarce water. It can even open space for community-led conversations about relocation as the overheating world retreats from rising seas and inland desertification is inevitable. Supporting and enabling communities to make decisions is also vital for rebuilding confidence in democracy, which has collapsed in recent years. The ongoing panic-buying response to Covid-19 suggests that the abject failure of government to provide leadership through the fires worsened this further. This is now an opportunity to rethink governance, reclaim agency for communities, build practices of trust and social cohesion, embedded in respect for expert advice. Now it’s important to recognise that with this government we’re not going to get these kinds of changes. At best we might hold off the push to weaken the EPBC even further. But that shouldn’t stop us advocating for what we need. Quite the opposite. Politics, like the natural world it operates within, is a system. It works in complex ways because all it is is the collected actions of humans, influenced by each other and by external impetuses such as the weather. Or viruses. Donella Meadows, the modern mother of systems thinking, wrote that the most effective leverage point to change a system is “the mindset or paradigm out of which the system ... arises”. It’s critical, then, that we confront the paradigm which sees environmental protection as of marginal importance at best, and as a barrier at worst. It’s vital that we challenge the mindsets of human disconnection from and dominance over nature. Over the past three months, a huge number of people made that conceptual leap. In recent weeks the crisis has become such that even mainstream politics finds it impossible to ignore. At the same time, over this period numerous people decided to just get on with it, without waiting for government. In both bushfire response and the tremendous mutual aid response to Covid-19, millions of us are setting up local projects, or joining existing ones, that make life better, generate social cohesion, reduce our footprint, and cultivate an ethic of care – for ourselves, for each other, for the natural world we are part of. If enough of us start doing this in our communities, and if enough submissions to the EPBC inquiry call for reforms that are embedded in ecological thinking, we will be putting a whole lot of small chocks under the lever. Each of those chocks is tiny. But together they can tip the balance. All of a sudden, especially at a moment like this, change will come. • Tim Hollo is executive director of the Green Institute and visiting fellow at the Australian National University’s school of regulation and global government (RegNet)"
"**A Kent MP ""initially surprised and disappointed"" by the move to place the county into tier three has said the strain on hospitals makes it necessary.**
Laura Trott, the Conservative MP for Sevenoaks, said there was ""simply no leeway"" in hospital capacity.
She said the number of patients being admitted with Covid-19 continued to increase on a daily basis, with elective operations being cancelled.
Meanwhile, other MPs have expressed dissatisfaction with the tier system.
Kent MPs who had been hoping for separate tiers for varying boroughs are due to meet Health Secretary Matt Hancock on Monday.
Ashford MP Damian Green said that, unless he sees ""convincing evidence"", he will vote against the new tier system next week, describing it as ""irrational"".
Ms Trott, who sits on the Health and Social Care Committee, said she had spent Thursday speaking to local hospitals and health ministers, after which the need for the heightened restrictions had become clear.
She said Darent Valley Hospital, near Dartford, was full, but ""trying to add additional beds"", and the Tunbridge Wells Hospital, in Pembury, was at 90% capacity.
She revealed that the NHS in Medway and Swale was deploying full ""'business continuity measures', which basically means they have declared a major incident and can no longer accept new cases"".
She said in Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells five of the 20 operating theatres had closed so staff could be redeployed to wards.
""There is simply no leeway in our hospital capacity, and it is vital that we use every tool possible to prevent a further rise in cases from their already high base locally,"" she said.
""The government has pledged to review our status in two weeks. If there is a reduction in pressure on our hospitals, I will push very hard for us to return to a district level tier system in Kent.""

"**Boris Johnson has defended his decision to place 55 million people in England into the two highest tiers of Covid restrictions, arguing the country needs ""simplicity and clarity"".**
The PM said measures due to come in when lockdown ends on Wednesday were more ""relaxed"" but would ""drive"" Covid down until a vaccine is available.
But a group of Tory MPs is threatening to rebel in a Commons vote on Tuesday.
If Labour backs them, this could threaten the government's majority.
There is concern that the government is adopting a ""one-size-fits all"" approach, which does not reflect local levels of infection.
From Wednesday, more than 32 million people are due to be living under tier two restrictions, banning indoor meetings between households.
A further 23 million people would be placed under the highest - tier three - restrictions, which further limit contact between people outdoors.
Just over 1% of England's population would enter the lowest - tier one - restrictions, under which the ""rule of six"" applies both indoors and outdoors.
Conservative MP and former cabinet minister Damian Green, who represents Ashford, in Kent, which is set to go into tier three, told the BBC he would vote against the government unless it provided ""new and convincing evidence"".
""Instead of having these wide county-based areas, where people are put in tiers, then we should do it on a borough basis,"" he said.
""In an area like mine, the incidence is less than it is in Liverpool, which has just been released down into tier two. So, as it stands, the current policy, the current allocation of tiers on these wide bases, are just not evidence-based.""
Speaking on a visit to Public Health England laboratories, at Porton Down, Wiltshire, Mr Johnson said he understood the ""frustration"" of those in higher-tier areas, whose own town or village did not have high levels of the disease.
But he added that the government ""cannot divide the country up into loads and loads of very complicated sub-divisions"" and had to ensure ""some simplicity and clarity"".
""Unless you beat the problem in the high-incidence area, the low-incidence area, I'm afraid, starts to catch up,"" Mr Johnson said.
He said ""tough tiering"" was still more ""relaxed by a long way than the current lockdown measures"" and it would ""drive the disease down... until a vaccine comes on stream, which we hope will be over the next weeks and months"".
Asked about mass Covid testing, Mr Johnson said: ""The supply [of kits] I don't think is going to be the problem. The issue is going to be getting everybody mobilised to understand the potential advantage of [it].""
Aware of the disquiet on its own backbenches, the government has promised to publish impact assessments of the new restrictions; a key demand from concerned MPs.
There's also a suggestion that areas could move into lower tiers when numbers are reviewed at regular intervals.
But that's unlikely to see off the brewing Tory rebellion.
Some Conservatives have already publicly declared that they won't vote for the new tier system when it's put before the Commons next week.
If enough rebel the government might have to look to the opposition to get this through Parliament.
Sir Keir Starmer is still deciding whether his party will back the plan, although it is likely to have enough support overall.
However, it's not a good look for the government to have to rely on Labour in the face of unrest on its own benches.
The Covid Recovery Group of Conservative MPs, set up to scrutinise the government's response to the pandemic, is threatening a revolt in next Tuesday's vote.
The group's chair, Mark Harper, said evidence provided by the government to justify the tier system was not ""compelling"". He called for more information on the measures' effects on different sectors of the economy.
He added that on ""too many occasions, ministers have made arguments and they've not stacked up"".
Deputy chairman Steve Baker called the measures ""truly appalling"" and said the modelling used by government scientists had been ""wrong time and time again"".
The group claims to have 70 members, but it is not certain how many of them would be expected to rebel against the government.
Forty-three Conservatives would have to defy the prime minister to defeat the plan, if all opposition MPs also voted against.
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is expected to decide early next week whether to support Mr Johnson, after consulting government coronavirus experts.
Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said Labour was ""not against"" tougher restrictions or tiers, but would seek ""reassurances"" on support for the poor and vulnerable.
Under the government's plan, Kent and large parts of the Midlands, north-east and north-west England would go into tier three.
Only Cornwall, the Isles of Scilly and the Isle of Wight would be in tier one.
Mr Johnson said the government's planned ""review point"" - on 16 December - gave the ""prospect of areas being able to move down the tier scale"".
But Professor John Edmunds, a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said he could not imagine ""huge changes"" to restrictions by then.
He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that experts were unlikely to ""have accumulated much data"" in time.
The government has promised to publish an impact assessment before MPs vote on the new rules.

 _Global Science Report is a weekly feature from the Center for the Study of Science, where we highlight one or two important new items in the scientific literature or the popular media. For broader and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly “Current Wisdom.”_   
  
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory’s Benjamin Santer and his mentor, Tom Wigley, of the National Center for Atmospheric Research seem, well, a little _obsessed_ over Cato’s Pat Michaels. First, Santer threatened to “beat the cr&p out of him”, and then Wigley tried to foment a cabal to “re-assess” his doctoral dissertation, under grounds that were completely, unalterably, and demonstrably 100 percent false.   
  
So it’s no surprise that they have just published—two years after the fact—what they consider to be a rejoinder to Michaels’ 2010 testimony to the Subcommittee on Energy and Environment of the Committee on Science and Technology of the United States House of Representatives. There’s about as much real substance here as there was in Wigley’s very ill-informed (and seemingly actionable, if Michaels didn’t have a day job here at Cato) campaign against his doctorate.   
  
It’s just been published in the journal _Climate Dynamics_. This is technically peer-reviewed, but, judging from the climategate emails and the serial paper trail of threatening journal editors (say, by writing to the University administrations where they worked) as well as the less than high quality contents of the actual paper, it makes you wonder just how critical the reviewers actually were.   
  
In their paper, Wigley and Santer wrote:   




Michaels’ 2010 Congressional testimony...is in conflict with the results presented here. This testimony makes the claims that “…greenhouse-related warming is clearly below the mean of relevant forecasts by IPCC”, and that “… the Finding of Endangerment from greenhouse gases by the Environmental Protection Agency is based on a very dubious and critical assumption”. The “assumption” referred to here is the IPCC statement that is the primary focus of the present paper, i.e., the statement that most of the warming since 1950 is very likely due to the human-caused increase in greenhouse gas concentrations.



Regarding Michaels’ statement that “…greenhouse-related warming is clearly below the mean of relevant forecasts by IPCC” Wigley and Santer argued that:   




Roughly half of these [IPCC climate model] simulations did not consider the cooling effect of indirect aerosol forcing, so the results, on average, would be biased towards trends that are warmer than observed even if the models were perfect (cf. Santer et al. 2011).



So the climate models are biased to producing more warming than is observed? Isn’t that what Michaels said? These guys just won’t take “yes” for an answer.   




And in fact, the reference in the above quote to “Santer et al. 2011” is a paper published by Santer and Wigley (and 15 others) that finds:   




The multi-model average [lower atmospheric temperature] trend is always larger than the average observed [lower atmospheric temperature] trend…[a]s the trend fitting period increases…average observed trends are increasingly more unusual with respect to the multi-model distribution of forced trends.



That says what you think it says! Model temperature trends are _always_ higher than the observed temperature trends and that over longer periods (i.e., more robust analysis) the model/observed discrepancy grows. Here is the relevant figure from that paper.   






**Figure 1.** A comparison between modeled and observed trends in the average temperature of the lower atmosphere, for periods ranging from 10 to 32 years (during the period 1979 through 2010). The yellow is the 5-95 percentile range of individual model projections, the green is the model average, the red and blue are the average of the observations, as compiled by Remote Sensing Systems and University of Alabama in Huntsville respectively (adapted from Santer et al., 2011).   
  
Their own analysis supports Michaels’ contention, which they somehow say is wrong. Beats me.   
  
In fact, their picture looks an awful lot like the one that Michaels used in his testimony (Figure 2).   
  




**Figure 2.** Range of climate model probabilities of surface temperature trends (gray shading) overlaid with the observed surface temperature trend from the Climate Research Unit (blue line) (data through September 2010).   
  
It’s worth noting that Michaels’ was the first presenter of this type of chart several years ago. In fact, Wigley reviewed a paper it was in, helped get the editor to kill it, and then, with Santer, published something mighty similar. How strange for someone they are arguing is wrong.   
  
It goes on.   
  
They then take exception with Michaels’ statement to Congress that the IPCC’s central finding that “[m]ost of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-twentieth century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations” is “dubious.”   
  
Wigley and Santer spill a lot of ink over the concept that _in the absence of everything else_ , that the _potential_ warming from anthropogenic greenhouse gases is likely greater than the _observed_ warming. Michaels didn’t say that it wasn’t. In fact, most people believe this as true.   
  
Michaels was concerned about the _observed_ warming not some hypothetical, unrealizable (and therefore unverifiable) change. After all, it is the actual warming that the environment largely responds to. So when assessing the accuracy of the IPCC statement on observed warming, it is therefore appropriate to divide it up between various elements as he did.   
  
While there’s a lot of gory detail in this discussion (see here, for more ), one thing that I think we all should be able to agree on is that it is physically impossible for something (like the emissions of anthropogenic greenhouse gases) to be responsible for causing _more_ than 100% of what has been observed, and that such statements like this one from Wigley and Santer’s paper,   




Here, the probability that the model-estimated GHG component of warming is greater than the entire observed trend (i.e., not just greater than ‘‘most’’ of the observed warming) is about 93%.



is something other than science, because one surely cannot find something that nature will not reveal.   
  
The bottom line here is that in their paper, Wigley and Santer seem to place more import on the attack of Pat Michaels, than they do on the actual logic behind it.

"The coronavirus pandemic has brought urgency to the defining political question of our age: how to distribute risk. As with the climate crisis, neoliberal capitalism is proving particularly ill-suited to this. Like global warming, but in close-up and fast-forward, the Covid-19 outbreak shows how lives are lost or saved depending on a government’s propensity to acknowledge risk, act rapidly to contain it, and share the consequences.  On these matters, competence and ideology overlap. Governments willing to intervene have been more effective at stemming the virus than laissez-faire capitalists. The further right the government, the more inclined it is to delay action and offload blame elsewhere. International comparisons suggest this could be making infection and death rates steeper. Take the US, where Donald Trump is only now acknowledging the seriousness of the pandemic after weeks of claiming fears were exaggerated. Until recently, his government put more money into shielding the oil industry than providing adequate testing kits. He reportedly ordered officials to downplay early warnings because he did not want bad news in an election year. The US now has one of the fastest rising numbers of new cases in the world. In Brazil, the ultra-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, is equally reckless. He claimed the risks of coronavirus were overblown, until 17 of his aides and security detail tested positive after a trip to the US. Last weekend, he ignored his own government’s advice and chose to shake hands and pose cheek-to-cheek for selfies at a mass rally of supporters. As cases and deaths surge, his support has plummeted. In the UK, Boris Johnson acknowledged the risk, but did little about it. Though not as extreme in his denial as Trump or Bolsonaro, Johnson’s government first dithered, then dabbled with a policy of “herd-immunity”that was reportedly driven by Dominic Cummings’ desire to protect the economy, even if it cost pensioners’ lives. The UK has since shifted tack and enforced a lockdown, but its controls are still haphazard. Last week, daily deaths in the UK were reckoned to be on a steeper upward curve than Italy was at the same stage. By contrast, more interventionist governments – generally but not exclusively those which are centrist or leftwing – have acted more quickly and shared the burden of risk more widely. Norway, Denmark and Sweden already appear to have flattened the coronavirus curve. Spain and France implemented lockdowns at around 200 deaths, which the UK and US have far surpassed. In Asia, China initially attempted to hide the problem from the public when the virus emerged in Wuhan, then mobilised huge public resources to enforce a strict lockdown and provide extra hospital beds. South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand also appear to have turned the corner thanks to different combinations of extensive testing, quarantine measures and public health education. Other factors are at play. Asian countries with prior experience of the Sars epidemic appear to have been better prepared. Italy, one of the worst affected countries, has one of the world’s oldest populations. In Japan’s case, the relatively flat curve of confirmed cases may also be a result of the government’s unwillingness to do widespread testing because it could jeopardise the Olympics. Similarly, the relatively low number of cases in the global south has raised hopes that warmer weather might slow the disease – but this is far from certain. A comparatively low number of coronavirus cases could be the result of a lag caused by distance from the origin of the disease, relatively lower levels of international traffic, and fewer resources for testing. This pandemic has amplified the importance of assessing and controlling risk before it gets out of hand. But the political champions of the neoliberal right, such as Trump and Bolsonaro, are more inclined to deny and delay, as climate politics have shown us in recent years. When it comes to a pandemic like Covid-19, that position is untenable. No leader can deny the science, nor can they endlessly delay action as they have done on global heating. Muddling through until the next election is not an option; leaders will be judged on deaths next week, not emissions reductions in 2050. The demographics are also completely different. Unlike the climate crisis, the virus predominantly threatens the elderly – the right’s core support group – rather than millennials. So far, the worst affected regions are also closer to the centre of economic power: the cool industrialised north rather than the warmer developing south (though the latter may suffer more in the future due to weaker healthcare systems). For the right, this makes the pandemic a greater political threat than the climate crisis has ever been. Unless they can quickly get on top of the disease, they will lose any claim to being champions of national security. It is entirely possible that the effects of this pandemic could be one of the most catastrophic failures of free-market capitalism. This should also be a lesson for the left. If state intervention and scientific advice is effective in dealing with the virus, the same principles should be applied more aggressively towards the still more apocalyptic threats of climate disruption and the collapse of nature. Until now, the left has recognised these dangers, but done little to act on them because economic growth has always taken precedence. The pandemic has proved that delays are deadly and expensive. If we are to avoid a cascade of future crises, governments must think beyond a return to business as usual. Our conception of what is “normal” will have to change. We’ll need to invest in natural life-supporting systems such as a stable climate, fresh air and clean water. In the past, those goals have been dismissed as unrealistic or expensive, but recent weeks have shown how quickly the political compass can shift. First though, we need to accept – and share – risk. Instead of deferring risks to future generations, weaker populations and natural systems, governments need to transform risks into responsibilities we all bear. The longer we hesitate, the fewer resources we will have at our disposal, and the more risk we will have to divide. • Jonathan Watts is the Guardian’s global environment editor "

Guest Post by Willis Eschenbach
It was hot here a couple of days ago. I walked past a huge aloe vera plant, taller than my head, that grows by our house. The heat radiating off of the plant was palpable. I could feel a wash of warm air over me as I stood downwind of it. For a while I thought about the curious ability of plants to heat the air around them, and then I let it go.
Figure 1. Solar absorber, natural style. Note how the design efficiently intercepts sunlight because of the spiral, uneven pattern of the leaves. Also note that the design keeps photons from escaping through the funnel-shaped nature of the leaf pattern. Finally, consider that when the plant emits IR from the inner leaves, it will be re-absorbed by outer leaves, perhaps a number of times. This gives the plant, in effect, a local “greenhouse effect” due to the multiple re-absorption of the IR. The leaf geometry also greatly slows down the passage of the air through the plant, once again increasing the local warming. The net of all of those is a warm plant, surrounded by warm air.
I was reminded of our aloe vera again when a friend sent me a copy of the paper “A Warm Miocene Climate at Low Atmospheric CO2 levels,” by Knorr et al. It reports the results of a climate model analysis of the Miocene, the period from about twenty-three million years ago up to five million years ago. It is in press at GRL (paywalled), but the results are discussed here.
In their abstract, we find (emphasis mine):
In this study we present climate simulations of the Late Miocene (11-7 Ma) with a preindustrial CO2 level, using a coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model (AOGCM). The simulated global mean surface temperature of ~17.8 ºC represents a significantly warmer climate than today. We have analyzed the relative importance of tectonic [shape and location of the continents] and  vegetation changes as forcing factors. We find that the strongest temperature increase is due to the Late Miocene vegetation distribution, which is more than three times stronger than the impact induced by tectonic alterations. Furthermore, a combination of both forcing factors results in a global temperature increase which is lower than the sum of the individual forcing effects. Energy balance estimates suggest that a reduction in the planetary albedo and a positive water vapor feedback in a warmer atmosphere are the dominating mechanisms to explain the temperature increase. Each of these factors contributes about one half to the global temperature rise of ~3 K. Our results suggest that a much warmer climate during the Late Miocene can be reconciled with CO2 concentrations similar to pre-industrial values.
In looking at the effect of plants on the climate, I’d like to discuss the use of the models, how much weight we should put on their results, and how they could be improved.

The first rule of models says
All Models Are Wrong, But Some Models Are Useful
Their usefulness, of course, depends on their ability to replicate the reality which they are modeling. One issue with the models is that many of them still are not what I call “lifelike”. I discussed this problem of “lifelike” climate model results here. If the models do not act like the real climate, why should we believe them? Unfortunately, no one has ever instituted this kind of test to compare all of the models. It should be a part of a standard suite of climate model tests … dream on.
So at the moment we don’t know if the climate model used in this test gives a lifelike simulation of today, much less of ten million years ago. But I digress. The study says (emphasis mine):
We utilize the comprehensive AOGCM ECHAM5-MPIOM without any flux corrections [e.g. Jungclaus et al., 2006]. The atmosphere model ECHAM5 was used at T31 resolution (~3.75º) with 19 vertical levels. The ocean model MPIOM was run at an average resolution of ~3º with 40 vertical layers. Vegetation is a fixed factor represented by specifying different land surface parameters like albedo, roughness length, vegetation ratio, leaf area index and maximum soil water capacity.
Here we run into another modeling problem. They have set up the vegetation parameters to coincide with what we know of the Miocene landscape. This, of course, means that they are using vegetation as a forcing, rather than a feedback.
But we have been informed, over and over, that the vegetation is a feedback and never a forcing …
This is both a strength and a weakness of the models. We can make assumptions like where the vegetation grew and force things in the model to be a certain way. Then we can see what the effect of that on the results might be.
Unfortunately, the climate doesn’t work that way, where one thing holds steady while everything else changes. So even though we can get some insights, we have no assurance that the effect that we find is real. For example, we don’t know if the Miocene vegetation (which is specified) fits with what the model says were the climate patterns of that time.
Setting aside the manifold questions about the model, there were a couple of interesting parts of the study. The first was that they find that the main effect of the plants occurred through a change in the albedo, particularly for the Sahara. This is in accord with my experience of the aloe vera plant, where it was absorbing much more energy than the ground around it. In part this was because of the albedo of the plant being lower than the ground beneath, but in part it was from the geometry of the plant. (This latter effect is neglected in the model.)
The second interesting thing involves these two statements of theirs about the albedo:
The planetary albedo in MIO [the Miocene simulation] is reduced by ~0.014, which causes less shortwave reflection by the atmosphere and a warming.
and
Based on a zero-dimensional energy balance model [e.g. Budyko, 1969] the impact of α [albedo] and ε [effective long wave emissivity] can be quantified, each causing about one half of the global warming of ~3 K.
Assuming the same solar intensity as the present (345 W/m2), which the authors say that they have done, this change in albedo would result in a change in solar radiation of 0.014 times 345 = 4.83 W/m2. Given the temperature change of 1.5°C from the albedo change, this gives a climate sensitivity of:
1.5°C * 3.7 W m-2 per doubling_CO2 / 4.83 W m-2 = 1.15°C per doubling of CO2.
Me, I think that climate sensitivity is an illusion based on a misunderstanding of how climate works … but for those who believe in it, using Knorr et al’s figures and their concepts, that gives a very low sensitivity, well below the IPCC canonical figure. The IPCC AR4 Summary for Policymakers says (emphasis mine):
The equilibrium climate sensitivity is a measure of the climate system response to sustained radiative forcing. It is not a projection but is defined as the global average surface warming following a doubling of carbon dioxide concentrations. It is likely to be in the range 2 to 4.5°C with a best estimate of about 3°C, and is very unlikely to be less than 1.5°C.
“Very Unlikely”, in IPCC jargon, means less than 10% chance that the sensitivity is less than their minimum estimate of 1.5°C per doubling of CO2. Despite that, this study shows a sensitivity of about three-quarters of the IPCC minimum estimate …
So you’d think that the media headline from this study would be
“Climate Model Finds Extremely Low Climate Sensitivity”
Sadly, that might happen, but only in an alternate universe …
Best to all,
w.

"As a mental health professional, I disagree with the message in Paul Daley’s article (We face a pandemic of mental health disorders, 24 March). We’re not facing “a pandemic of severe mental health disorders”. We’re all facing entirely normal fear, anxiety, despair and confusion about a truly terrifying situation that challenges our whole way of life. Never has it been clearer that so-called “mental disorders” make sense in context. In fact, many professionals would argue that this applies to the whole range of experiences that are labelled as clinical depression, personality disorder, psychosis, and so on.  The more we label our understandable human reactions as disorders, the greater the temptation to disconnect them from their source and focus on new individual “treatments” instead. The drug companies must be rubbing their hands at the prospect of all these new customers. We can come out of this crisis in a better state than before by staying connected with our feelings and the urgent threats that have led to them, and taking collective action to deal with the root causes. These include climate change, environmental degradation, wildlife trafficking, insecure employment, the structure and funding of public services, and the neoliberal values that have driven us for far too long.Dr Lucy JohnstoneConsultant clinical psychologist, Bristol "
"James Shaw, New Zealand’s climate change minister, has asked the country’s independent climate change commission to check whether its emissions targets under the Paris agreement are enough to limit global heating to 1.5C. He explains why he’s prioritising the issue during a strict national lockdown to stop the spread of Covid-19, which could send New Zealand’s unemployment rate soaring. To say that we find ourselves in an unprecedented moment is so obvious and has been so often repeated it’s almost become white noise. What is less obvious, however, is where we go from here.  In any significant crisis, let alone one as catastrophic as the Covid-19 pandemic, it is an entirely understandable human reflex to want things to “return to normal”, to “go back to the way they were before”. And, when faced with economic headwinds – in recent decades, the Asian financial crisis, the global financial crisis and, in our own case, the Christchurch earthquakes) successive governments the world over have directed their efforts to meeting public expectation and getting back to business as usual. Unfortunately, one of the features of business as usual was a highly polluting and ecologically unsustainable economy on a pathway that was locking in catastrophic climate change. Successive responses to economic crises have seen climate change and the natural environment we depend on for life on Earth as a nice-to-have, something to think about once we’ve got the economy back on track and there’s a bit more money to go round. This means that action on climate change keeps being deferred, as economic shocks occur on average about every ten years. It also means that, when we do collectively start feeling confident enough to start worrying about climate change again, we find that our economic recovery programmes have locked us back in to the same highly polluting pathway we were on before. We quite simply cannot afford to do that one more time. Global CO2 emissions need to at least halve in the next 10 years, according to a 1992 treaty, the United Nations framework convention on climate change. If we spend the next few years restoring business as usual, we will have only a few years left to transform that business as usual into something else. It simply won’t be able to be done. This time, we could do it differently. This time, we could plan our recovery to create a clean-tech, high-value economy that works for everyone. In which case, rather than willing things back to “normal” as quickly as possible, let’s imagine something different for a moment. A future where people have everything they need to lead fulfilling, meaningful and prosperous lives. Where simple everyday tasks like making the morning coffee, to travelling to and from work, to warming our homes is powered by clean, renewable energy. A future where electricity demand goes up – but only because people are plugging in their electric vehicles. Where cheap, clean power brings significant economic benefits for small businesses, and rural communities. Above all, a future that is more equitable, more prosperous, and more innovative – and all within planetary limits. We know it is in our power to change the way we do things. Over the last few months, nearly all of us have made changes to the way we live and work in order to protect people and their loved ones around the world. Our responses to Covid-19 – as parents, as friends, as neighbours – have made clear just what it is that we value more than anything else. Not only this, but we have seen the difference good governments can make to people’s lives – and that we can, when we need to, make bold decisions for the collective good. We have also been reminded in the most profound and difficult way why we must act in accordance with science. Clearly, government spending over the next few months needs to ease the economic pressures people and businesses are feeling right now. But that doesn’t mean it cannot also change the quality of economic growth and reduce its impact on the climate. Nor does it mean that governments cannot apply a climate lens to every major policy decision, as New Zealand is doing. An economic stimulus is partly about choice. In the past, governments have made these choices based on the view that investments and values are separable. But they’re not. Our investments reflect our values. Nearly every country in the world has committed to playing their part in a global effort to clean up our economies and avoid the worse effects of climate change. Here in New Zealand, our parliament has – unanimously – enshrined the Paris goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels in domestic legislation. On Wednesday, I asked our new, politically independent, climate change commission to review whether our international target is consistent with that Paris goal. If they conclude that there is more we need to do, the commission will provide recommendations on what changes we should make. This will ensure we are playing our part globally. I hope that other countries will do the same, if they aren’t already. It is a time for governments, regions, and cities around the world to mobilise and deploy resources to tackle the climate crisis at the same time as rebuilding their economies, all whilst creating high value green jobs. This is indeed an unprecedented moment. What we do with it will determine the quality of life for billions of people – not just for the next few months or years, but for the generations to come. James Shaw is New Zealand’s climate change minister and co-leader of the Green party. "

Share this...FacebookTwitterAnother green pipe dream, electric cars, bites the dust.

A Reva i/G-Wiz charging in London. Photo source: Wikipedia – file from the Wikimedia Commons,flickr.com, frankh (Flickr User)
CO2 Handel reports that Toyota, one of the leading hybrid car manufacturers, sees no future for the purely electric car.
There is still no business model that can succeed on the market,” said the spokesman of Toyota Deutschland on Tuesday. Instead, Toyota will focus more on hybrid models over the coming years.
Toyota wants to continue development and sell electric cars for field tests, but only to a few selected customers in the USA and Japan. No sales are planned for Europe at this time.”
The main problem with the electric cars is their lack of efficiency with the batteries, and there are no technical breakthroughs in sight.
Meanwhile, the Rheinpfalz daily here reports on the dismal sales of electric cars in Germany. Pure electric cars, charged by renewable energy, were once hoped to be the answer to the dirtier combustion engine and would herald in a new era of clean transportation. That is now looking more and more like a pipe dream.
The Rheinpfalz daily writes:
For years they dominated international car shows and were to seen everywhere in the media: electric cars. However up to now, they have been completely missing on one decisive place: the streets. In the first part of 2012, only 4541 electric cars were registered, and that in a total market of about 51.7 million vehicles.”
Once again, as is the case with some forms renewable energy, noboby in the free market is willing to give electric cars the time of day. Not even the fans in the media and government are buying them. For the money, they simply do not provide mobility solutions that people have come to expect.

The Rheinpfalz daily writes:
Because of skimpy demand, the French PSA concern is stopping both of its electric models: the Citroen C-Zero and Peugeot iOn. For the same reason, production lines will be stopped for the Ampera sister model the Chevrolet Volt at the end of the month.”
That means the German government can forget about reaching its lofty target of having 1 million electric cars on German streets by 202o.
“Nobody believes it’s going to happen,” says Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, a professor for automotive economics at the University of Duisburg-Essen, according to the Rheinpfalz.
The problem with electric cars is all the impracticality involved with charging them, their low range, and massive battery weight. The batteries themselves pose huge environmental challenges that every proponent refuses to take into account.
Worse, studies show that electric cars mean a limitation in mobility, and not an expansion. The infrastructure for charging electric cars is also plagued with problems. The Rheinpfalz asks:
Does the connection fit with my car? Can my charging cable handle the electric current load that is supplied by the charging station? For example, does the charging station supply 32 A while my cable can only handle 16A?
Other electric cars have also been shown to be unsafe, some catching fire.
Even the German government, probably the biggest proponent of electric cars on the planet (at least judging from all the promotional literature it cranks out) is snapping them up. According to the Rheinpflaz: “In 2012 the car fleet of the Federal Ministry for Transportation has only 2 electric cars and one fuel cell car. It has lots of electric bikes.”
Just more truth and reality about the great green pipe dream.

"The city of Famagusta in Cyprus lies empty, as it has since the 1974 invasion that divided the island into north and south. The city its former inhabitants left behind is now a ghost town, streets overgrown with bushes, windowless buildings like concrete skulls, roofless brick homes left open to the elements.  Reviving Famagusta is a key part of the jigsaw puzzle that comprises the efforts to find a solution to Cyprus’ social and ethnic tensions, a puzzle that this year’s US-brokered talks between Turkish and Cyprus authorities hope to solve. While the events by which Famagusta came to be deserted, and the length of time it has remained so, are an extreme example, such abandoned brownfield land is all too common. The term brownfield, depending on your definition, refers to sites and broader areas that have been affected by their former land uses, have become derelict or underused, may have contamination issues, usually occupy space in developed urban areas and in any event require intervention to bring them back into beneficial use.  Brownfield redevelopment was among the issues Chancellor George Osborne raised at his annual Mansion House address, focusing on the urgent need to speed up the process of putting unused land to good use, specifically for housing. The Chancellor announced local authorities will be required to use Local Development Orders to pre-approve 90% of their brownfield sites for housing so that building can start sooner.  A sum of £5m is being allocated in support of this endeavour.  The chancellor’s announcement means a clear understanding of what exactly a brownfield is has returned to the heart of national politics. For example in the US brownfields are by definition contaminated. In England, the government’s regeneration vehicle – the Homes and Communities Agency – uses the term as a synonym for previously developed land, although it would be more useful to restrict the term to only previously developed land that is also vacant. While the exact definition does not always matter, when funding and government policies are targeted towards sites that meet specific criteria (as in the US) or allocated to government departments in order to meet targets (as was the case under the previous UK government) then definitions are vital. Mark Twain is credited with advising “buy land – they’re not making it any more”, and by and large he was right; he might have said “reuse brownfield land – they’ll make plenty more of it”. Some cities are shrinking (Detroit, most spectacularly), but most cities are growing, and can do so only by building up, down, or outward. In any case citizens expect, and authorities should strive for, progress. We expect a variety of services from city land: shelter, education, entertainment, manufacturing, offices, worship, shopping, sport and culture.  The structures housing these services may well outlast the service, but the land will outlast them all. We do not consume land in the way that we do food or fuel. But we do have a habit of discarding land and moving on to the next parcel to be used for the next land use.   We know reusing land is worthwhile. In the UK there’s little choice, being as it is a small, densely populated island with a long history of urban settlement. While our understanding of the long-term behaviour of cities as complex systems is getting better, we face the challenge of predicting the impact of different land uses, and choosing the most sustainable, or at least avoiding the obviously unsustainable. In many cases flexibility beyond the next land use is key. But for housing we are building a legacy that will last a century, perhaps more. Where we build our new homes will influence how far we travel to work, how well we interact with our neighbours, how creative we are likely to be. Think of brownfield sites as the empty space in the eight pieces on a grid with nine spaces where the challenge is to arrange them so as to form a coherent image. In just the same way as many economists argue full employment is undesirable, so the same goes for eradicating brownfield sites. A derelict site is needed to build the new hospital while the current one continues treating patients. Only once the new facility opens its operating theatre doors, can the old be demolished, in turn to become the site for a new school, perhaps, and so the land use cycle goes on turning. If an area has no immediate hard use for a site, then it can be put to interim uses: a garden, temporary car park, or an arena for outdoor performances and markets.  For most people the term brownfield site conjures up images of derelict factories, abandoned train stations, or closed mines. Yet by using the term to mean any previously developed land, past target-driven governments have claimed high rates of brownfield redevelopment. This nonsense extended to counting back gardens and housing estate open space as brownfields, resulting in the absurd accounting of infill development as brownfield reuse. This was eventually dropped by the coalition government, and the targets abandoned altogether. However best use of brownfield, in the colloquial sense, sites, and the challenge of wise stewardship of our cities, remains. The question we ought to be asking is what sort of cities are we trying to create, and then considering how those empty spaces in the puzzle can help us achieve that, in addition to building high, digging deep, and even occasionally spreading out. We need to minimise our reliance on the car and encourage the design of more walkable cities – ones that the high streets imagined by Mary Portas would benefit from, and which could begin to arrest the slide into obesity and diabetes it seems we are on. The challenge for the chancellor is to realise the Mansion has many rooms and not all can be counted. It is not only building houses on brownfield sites he should be supporting, but instead great urban places to live, work and play. He and his cabinet colleagues in the Department for Communities and Local Government should be encouraging us to create. He could keep perhaps in his pocket a child’s puzzle, to remind him that space is fixed but what we do with it is not."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe record cold that is still gripping Germany even set a record low at the warming-obsessed Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research this weekend. At yahoo news.com.html today they write (my emphasis):
Last weekend the lowest temperatures in more than 100 years were recorded in many parts of the country for this time of the year. For example in Dresden the record of 1917 was broken, in Potsdam the record set in 1899 was broken. In northeastern Germany Sunday morning temperatures between -15°C and -20°C were widespread. […] ‘What we are now experiencing is a 100-year cold for the month of March,’ says meteorologist Dominik Jung of the weather portal www.wetter.net.”
Germany has just seen its 5th consecutive colder-than-normal winter in a row (a record). Now Europeans are wondering if they’ll even see spring in April this year, let alone January.
It is a good time to ask ourselves just what were some of Germany’s leading “climate scientists” projecting in “peer-reviewed papers” using their super-computers and “sophisticated, fine tuned climate models” just a couple of years ago. Where were the world’s leading scientists saying we were headed just a few years ago?
To answer that, we remind readers of one spectacularly false projection made by scientists and media just 2 and half years ago, a time when they insisted we believe “the science is settled” and anyone who dared to doubt was just a “flat-earther…a denier”.
On September 30, 2010, German conservative flagship daily Die Welt here carried the visionary headline:
“By 2030 spring will begin already at the end of January
Scientists in Gießen have been simulating climate change in a time lapse in an experiment: Their findings are worrisome.”

In DIE WELT’s report, they wrote about how scientists of the Plant Ecology Institute at the University of Giessen were claiming that soil did not absorb CO2 as expected, and would emit even more of the powerful greenhouse gas nitrous oxide into the atmosphere than previously expected, thus accelerating global warming. These were the worrisome results of plant studies they had just conducted.
Institute Director Christoph Müller agreed that climate change was a natural process, but that the rate at how fast it was progressing was “unusual“.
DIE WELT added:
In 100 years the global temperature has risen an average of 0.7°C. What took thousands of years is now happening in 200 years. “Entire vegetation zones are going to shift. […] So that things do not get even hotter, something has to change”, demands Müller.
Miller then suggested a radical change in our lifestyle and on how we use energy.
I wonder in which direction Müller’s plant zones are shifting today? We do know that lots of migratory birds have turned back around and headed back south again.

Share this...FacebookTwitterFlagship ZDF German public television, Germany’s equivalent to CBS or BBC, reported on Hurricane Sandy yesterday evening on it famous “heute journal” news show. I was watching it live (which is very rare for me) and I couldn’t believe what I heard.
What follows is the video link of the broadcast. Just listen here to what the ZDF correspondent says (in German) at the 28:07 mark!
“Many older people say it reminds them of what happened in 1938. Back then there was the Long Island Express Storm. It claimed 800 million lives on the east coast. This time we will probably also not go without deaths.”
Imagine that. 800 million people on the east coast of a country that at the time had well under 200 million inhabitants.
Did you notice how anchorman Klaus Kleber on the line back in Germany tried to stop him…”how many!…”? Of course, it was a slip-up of gaffe proportions. But notice how when they slip up, it’s an “honest mistake – can happen to anyone!” But when someone else does it, it’s sure proof of incompetence.
Just imagine if Mitt Romney had said it. ZDF would be the first to replay it again and again and again, telling viewers that he just isn’t bright enough to be the President.
Maybe Prömpers was swaying because had been boozing it up and not because of the wind. I don’t know what would cause a reporter of a broadcaster as enlightened as ZDF to make such a dumb mistake.
To be fair, an hour later in the Phoenix broadcast he corrected the figure to “800” lives.

Science is not a popularity contest. Scientific truth is not determined by a popular vote or by the fame of those who make an assertion. A ‘consensus’ is when people have conceded agreement about something most of them don’t actually fully believe.



So in that respect, it’s no more important that Apollo astronauts dispute the ‘consensus’ view of climate change than the bogus claim of ’97 percent of scientists’. But in other important respects, it’s a very telling statistic.



There are only 12 men who have walked on the moon, and only 4 are still living. Selected from the best of the best at the time, with impeccable reputations, why would any of them speak out and risk being called names like deniers of “basic physics”. Yet three of the four have: Harrison Schmitt, Charles Duke, Buzz Aldrin. (Plus others like Australian born Phil Chapman (support crew, Apollo 14) and Walter Cunningham (Apollo 7).



Climate alarmists love to invoke the name of NASA to try and justify their absurd catastrophism. “NASA put a man on the Moon”, runs the argument. “Why wouldn’t you believe **them**?”



It’d be merely churlish to point out that NASA also blew up two space shuttles. More pertinent is the fact that the climate tub-thumping unit, GISS, is only a very small part of the NASA bureaucracy. Assigning them the same gravitas as the Apollo program is as ridiculous as taking seriously the moon-hoax conspiracies of “a former NASA worker” who turns out to have been a low-level services contractor.



Or, perhaps, treating the ‘Very Special’ Nobel Peace Prize with the same respect as the Nobel Prize in Physics.



Maybe because they hate watching as the good name of NASA gets subverted into a pagan weather changing cult?



…The NASA space program was once one of mankind’s greatest scientific and engineering achievements. In 2012 49 former NASA staff including astronauts, directors of shuttle programs, flight operations, and spacecraft maintenance, wrote to NASA warning that GISS (Goddard Institute for Space Studies) was risking NASA’s reputation by making unproven remarks and ignoring empirical evidence.



More importantly, one of the astronauts is a respected scientist, as opposed to an activist with a Communications degree. Guess which opinion the legacy media will rely on?



Harrison [Schmitt] has been a vocal skeptic now for at least nine years. So far the ABC has not asked him why, or anything at all on the topic. But then, he’s only a PhD in Geology, what would he know? If he had a degree in international relations and journalism, or law, he could tell us what the climate is going to do all the time.



“…I’m a geologist [says Schmitt]. I know the Earth is not nearly as fragile as we tend to think it is. It has gone through climate change, it is going through climate change at the present time. The only question is, is there any evidence that human beings are causing that change?…



As Michael Crichton points out in his ‘cli-fi’ thriller, _State of Fear_ , climate scientists routinely pass off reconstructions and models as ‘evidence’. Extremely provisional theories are passed off as ‘settled science’.



Right now, in my profession, there is no evidence. There are models. But models of very, very complex natural systems are often wrong. The observations that we make as geologists, and observational climatologists, do not show any evidence that human beings are causing this. Now, there is a whole bunch of unknowns…So that’s the only skepticism I have: What is the cause of climate change?



“Normally, we have always assumed up until the Industrial Revolution that climate change is a function of the solar cycles — and indeed, there is still very strong evidence that’s the case.”



Crichton also argues that the current funding model of science has turned it into just another state bureaucracy, slavish as any other to the policy demands of government. Schmitt agrees.



“I, as a scientist, expect to have people question orthodoxy. And we always used to do that. Now, unfortunately, funding by governments, particularly the United States government, is biasing science toward what the government wants to hear.



“That’s a very dangerous thing that’s happening in science today, and it’s not just in climate.”



  
There is no reason to heed Schmitt’s opinion as an Apollo astronaut more than anyone else’s. But there is every reason to pay attention to the uncomfortable questions he raises about the current state of science and how it is being distorted by politics and money.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSpiegel’s latest online piece here is dubbed “Conspiracy Theories: What Motivates The Fact-Deniers“. Hat-tip: Ulrich Elkmann.
Ironically, in what was designed to be a sharp attack on “climate change deniers”, turns out to be an unwitting confirmation by Spiegel that it has profoundly changed its position on the climate issue. And, although Spiegel may not be aware of it, its article even de facto endorses the position of climate “deniers”, i.e. that climate changes [naturally] and that man [only] has “an influence” on climate.
Well, what the hell probably doesn’t?

Online Spiegel now says man only has “an influence on the climate change process”.
By now a Spiegel editor reading this might think: “What is NoTricksZone writing here!” Allow me to explain.
In its latest online attack article, Spiegel cites an old, already discredited Lewandowsky paper from July 2012, with the aim of taking cheap shots at American right-wingers. But note how Spiegel starts its article, in yellow above, (my emphasis):
The overwhelming majority of climate scientists agree that the climate is changing and that the man-made CO2 emissions have an influence on this process.”
Man has an influence? Really? That’s it – just “an influence”? Why didn’t Spiegel write something like “man-made CO2 emissions have a serious and unprecedented impact on this process” – like they always used to do? The following depicts what Spiegel used to think what “man’s influence” on climate was:

Spiegel front-page cover of Aug 11, 1986, issue no. 33/1986. depicts what Spiegel used to think of climate change.
Now man only “has an influence on the climate change process“. Wouldn’t you say that’s a very profound position correction by Spiegel? My, how the times have changed!
Of course Spiegel won’t admit this outright. They were probably hoping nobody would notice this slight position adjustment. Coming to terms with the fact that you had behaved like an irrational alarmist for decades is a long process that requires time. But Spiegel’s position trend on the climate issue is undeniable: going from a flooding catastrophe to some undefined influence.
In the 1980s, 90s and 2000s, Spiegel, convinced a climate catastrophe was coming fast, rolled out one alarmist report after the other. But by the end of the 2000s an article or two with skeptical tones started appearing. Stefan Rahmstorf reacted immediately to this thought emancipation and tried to bully Spiegel back into line. But nobody bullies Der Spiegel. The news magazine of German intellectuals followed with more skeptical articles, one even personally singled out and attacked Rahmstorf. Today Spiegel writer Axel Bojanowski, a geologist, writes regular articles that often pour cold water on irrational and alarmist climate scenarios.
Deniers Skeptics don’t deny (man-made) climate change. We are the ones who have been telling you it happens all the time! What we deny are the alarmism and the catastrophic scenarios. And yes, many among us are confident free markets are the way to go in coping with any change.
Yesterday’s online rant was perhaps written by a leftover alarmist and meant to take shots at American right-wing “deniers”. Oddly, and uncharacteristic of Spiegel, the piece was about old news from last year – perhaps fill-in for Easter. Lewandowsky’s paper has long since been discredited. The Spiegel author likely didn’t even bother Googling about it. Or, he/she just denied the facts.
In fact, the very people that Lewndowsky labels as deniers, those who he claims tend to believe the moon-landing was staged, include former NASA astronauts. The paper is just pure stupidity.
We can all agree with Spiegel’s new, sober position, and we very much welcome them joinng the denier more skeptical, rational, and critical position. Most of us will agree that you’d have to be a kook to believe that man doesn’t have some influence on climate through agriculture, land-use, aerosols, deforestation, etc. They might represent a couple percent of the skeptic ranks.
The real issue is: are we headed for a catastrophe of proportions depicted by the alarmists, e.g. Spiegel 1986? The answer clearly is no. Economic and civil suicide is not necessary. There’s plenty of time for the sensible upgrading of energy systems. In the meantime, go out and enjoy the Easter-time global warming.

Post by Dr. Ryan Maue (cross posted at my Policlimate)
“Must watch TV: Nye expounds on theory of racism”
Much “debate” has erupted in the liberal mainstream media concerning the effects of global warming on Hurricane Irene. With a few notable exceptions (Henry Fountain awesome), many of the journalists butchered the science and generally constructed disjointed narratives that quoted a variety of favorite experts which left me wondering why they even bother (Politico). Rush Limbaugh provided a compelling alternative explanation for the hurricane hype: “Politics is part of everything. The weather’s been politicized; the climate’s been politicized…Both Obama and the media were hoping for a disaster to revive his presidency and help prove climate change theory…The New York Times is trying to say that this violent hurricane is indeed indicative of global warming. It was a tropical storm when it left New York.”
But Bill Nye takes the “anti-science” crusade to a new level by showing up on Fox Business with my KFI 640 Saturday friend Charles Payne and embarrassing the hell out of himself. Once you watch the video and read the transcript, you will be left in amazement at his utter lack of comprehension of the topic at hand on national television! But, alas, Media Matters thinks Nye owned Payne (h/t to Andrew Revkin to Tweeted this). And CBS News headlines it as a story! Unbelievable!

The left actually thinks Bill Nye is a brilliant ambassador for their brand of global warming alarmism — a legitimate guy that understands the science and can articulate an explanation. However, Nye has no credentials or expertise with respect to global warming and hurricanes, at all. Not one iota.

Video is embedded or to go to CBS News and watch the Fox Business embedded video there. “Heady stuff, but Nye receives my respect for retaining his patience in outlining a life’s worth of work in a six-minute segment.” says Andrew Nusca. He has no idea that what Bill Nye is saying is disjointed and amateurish. Intricacies? Nye got almost everything wrong.
I transcribed my own transcript from the first 3 minutes of this (all I could take). Emphasis — bold and italics are my comments.
Charles Payne: While hurricane Irene brought more than just wind damage and flooding to the east coast, it’s revived a national debate as to whether global warming might be causing an increase in hurricanes and other extreme weather. In fact a recent cover story in Newsweek declared that this kind of wild weather may be quote “the new normal”. Here with insights on this is Bill Nye, otherwise known as the science guy.
Ok Bill, I’m going to come right at you. Um…Hurricane Irene – proof of global warming?
Bill Nye: Oh, I don’t think the word proof is what you are looking for – evidence of, a result of, yeah, yeah. Now here’s what the people will tell you that run these climate models. Now everybody, the word model in this usage is a computer program. A very sophisticated computer program. So you take data from satellites about the thickness of clouds and the extent of cloud-cover over the sea. You take data about the temperature of the sea surface. You take data about the existing weather say in North America or the Gulf of Mexico as this storm moves into it. Then you compute how much rain fell out of it, how much energy must have been put into it to create that much rain. It takes many months to analyze an event like Irene. Now the climate colleagues that I have will not tell you today that Irene was evidence or a result of climate change but check in with them about March next year after they have a few months to collect all of these millions and millions of data from weather services and satellites and compile them and run a climate model and show that Irene was a result of the world having more energy in the Earth’s atmosphere.
(Ryan: First of all, charitably, I think Nye is confusing a real-time operational weather forecast with a climate model. Climate models do not assimilate satellite observations of a given event — and it wouldn’t take months and months to compile the data. I have everything sitting on my server which generates my old FSU weather map page. Check back with them in March — that’s when they’ll have their climate model results back proving Irene was the result of more energy? This is a pretty unconventional way of doing climate or extreme event attribution. Bill Nye follows the “anti-scientific” method: I’ll give you the answer now, and then in 6-months, check back when I have the proof. )
CP: But here’s the thing here bill, ever since Katrina, right, we’ve heard that every year the hurricane season is going to be more devastating and apocalyptic, and the reality is we haven’t seen that. So how can Newsweek say “hey, this is a new normal”? is that irresponsible – is there any science behind that?
(Ryan: this is a great question by Payne. Since global hurricane activity — the number of storms, hurricanes, and Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) is at historical lows — collapsing since Katrina — as I showed in my recent GRL peer-reviewed paper, how on earth can you attribute one hurricane (Irene) to climate change.?)
BN: well there’s a lot more science behind that than just saying it’s not. But, uh, that aside. That’s only 6-years – in geologic time in terms of climate events, is not very long. Furthermore there is a lot of debate about this cool thing or remarkable thing is that the Sea-surface in the Pacific gets warmer, in the Pacific Ocean! Okay, tens of thousands of nautical miles away. As that gets warmer, it will strangely serve to decapitate certain hurricane or cyclonic storms off the coast of Africa – and actually get a few fewer hurricanes.
(Ryan: no kidding Nye, however, you haven’t come up with any science. Nye then launches into a tortured explanation of the El Nino Southern Oscillation warm phase — El Nino where the waters in the tropical Pacific cyclically become anomalously warm. But, it’s not “tens-of-thousands nautical miles away” — that’s more like the distance to the moon. There is actually little consensus in the climate community about the future of El Nino as the planet slowly warms. The CMIP3 models used for the IPCC AR4 report fail to reproduce historical ENSO events or variability, and therefore are useless prediction devices for the future. We already have a pretty good handle on the “teleconnection” effects of El Nino and La Nina on Atlantic hurricane development with research pioneered by Dr. Bill Gray and furthered by Dr. Phil Klotzbach who produces Colorado State’s seasonal hurricane forecasts. 2011 is a neutral-to-building La Nina year, so we should expect weaker vertical shear in the Main Development Region of the tropical Atlantic. It’s bizarre that Nye brought up El Nino which contradicts his original assertion that Irene was evidence of global warming.)
CP: But Bill, that’s not…
BN: This is another thing that’s very hard to show.
CP: But the Pacific Ocean, getting warmer, but that’s not from man.
(Ryan: excellent point again Charles. The tropical Pacific does not have a strong global warming signal over the past 30-years, which is due to the cyclical nature of ENSO on 2-7 year time scales. Our sea-surface temperature (SST) records get worse as you go backwards from the beginning of the satellite era in 1979. Nye has no answer.)
BN: (waving hands): you’re acting that you are dismissing those things like they they are not relevant.
(Ryan: Nye is defeated, and he knows it. After wagging his finger like Judge Judy, he pretty much has spent his arsenal of facts on this issue.)
CP: I’m not dismissing it, but you have so much information, I want to get to all of it. Are you saying though that it’s manmade, though?
BN: Well the world is getting warmer, uh, everybody, the world is getting warmer. I believe the debate is whether humans are causing it…Do we not agree that the world is getting warmer?
(Ryan: The world is getting warmer — so Irene has to be influenced by global warming. Maybe Irene did NOT reach its maximum potential because of global warming — has anyone considered that. Why must ALL of the climate change effects be a certain sign? Why didn’t Irene reach Category 5? Why did it weaken so fast if the SSTs were so warm? This is where the real tropical cyclone researchers will take over from the media hacks, and, yes, they will come with an answer in March. But, they will follow the “scientific” method and not the “I’ll get the proof later” Bill Nye “anti-science” method.)
CP: I have no idea. Someone told me that it’s warmed 1-degree over the past 100-years. I’ll take their word for it.
(Ryan: Charles is right.)
Show continues to talk about racism and shows the Al Gore “racism” clip – but Nye then really goes off into a different realm discussing that. I’m convinced that Fox News booked Nye knowing that he would butcher the science, and force me to write this post.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhat follows is not crazy – it’s what we used to call “civic duty” by caring citizens.
This is my open call to the NYPD, 26th Precinct, 520 West 126th Street, New York, NY 10027, Tel. (212) 678-1311, webpage here. This is the precinct responsible for NASA GISS, Columbia University.

It wouldn’t be the first time civil disobedience inciter and Data-Dr. James Hansen is apprehended for breaking the law. 
I am officially reporting, to the NYC police, NASA-GISS scientist James Hansen, pictured above, for manipulating and falsifying U.S. Government temperature data, with the likely intent to defraud U.S. citizens. He has been caught red-handed by Steven Goddard and other experts, not just once but on multiple occasions. All witnesses are urged to notify the authorities and to provide evidence of Hansen’s activity so that the authorities can properly investigate what plainly appears as criminal activity in broad daylight and, as duty calls, to render protection to the public they have sworn to serve. Tel. 212-678-1311.
EVIDENCE
Hansen’s statement in 1999: NASA GISS: Science Briefs: Whither U.S. Climate?, Here Hansen writes on US temperature trend:
Empirical evidence does not lend much support to the notion that climate is headed precipitately toward more extreme heat and drought. The drought of 1999 covered a smaller area than the 1988 drought, when the Mississippi almost dried up. And 1988 was a temporary inconvenience as compared with repeated droughts during the 1930s “Dust Bowl” that caused an exodus from the prairies, as chronicled in Steinbeck’s Grapes of Wrath. […]
….in the U.S. there has been little temperature change in the past 50 years, the time of rapidly increasing greenhouse gases — in fact, there was a slight cooling throughout much of the country.”
Since then, he has since doctored the data and claims today it is now warming rapidly.
Yet, look at Hansen’s US temperature chart in 1999, source: http://stevengoddard.wordpress/:

Compare the above chart to his new, doctored chart, now being used to defraud the US and world public, source: http://stevengoddard.wordpress/:

 
The next chart is a comparator to illustrate Hansen’s handiwork in misleading the public:

Suspect Hansen is being aided and abetted by a white, balding male, donning a goatee, who appears to be Hansen’s assistant and goes by the name “Gavin”.
Hansen has already once been arrested by authorities before, see above photo, and attempted to incite civil disobedience. He seems to think he’s above the law.
Now what follows is the latest rock-hard evidence of Hansen’s data doctoring to produce the warming results he wants to see:


Source:

http://stevengoddard.nasa-rewriting-history/
Steven Goddard here writes today:
Until about ten years ago, NASA showed the US on an 80 year long cooling trend, with the three hottest years being in the 1920s and 1930s. They have deleted the raw data from their website and blocked archiving, but John Daly captured it. It was originally located at this link:”
Request for police to investigate
Citizens should not be afraid to report any wrongdoing to the authorities, no matter what the stature of the suspect may be. There is nothing illegal about it. Moreover, it is your civic duty to do so. Do not let yourself be intimidated. This has got to be done.
Hansen has been caught red-handed, and the police are obligated to carry out their duty and investigate, and, if necessary, apprehend the suspect so that he may face eventual possible legal consequences.
Hansen is a high-ranking NASA scientist. However, in a nation of justice, authority and prestige at any level do not put anyone above the law. It’s what has made America fair and great. Yes, even people of high positions can be complete dirtbags, too – just like any other person among us. Let the evidence be presented and to speak for itself.
James Hansen’s justification for “adjusting” the US temperature will likely be the kind you’d expect to hear from a rapist gynecologist, claiming he was only examining his patient and looking out for her health. In Hansen’s case, the evidence is overwhelming showing he has been doctoring and manipulating US government data – to mislead the public on climate change.
We expect the authorities to take action to protect the public and to begin investigating immediately, as required by law.
Numerous parties have witnessed this data falsification and are ready to make sworn statements and provide overwhelming evidence, like that provided above. Witnesses with evidence are urged to call the police at the above mentioned number.
Let’s see if there is any justice left in America. Personally I’m confident the NYPD will handle this professionally and respond accordingly.
Citizens all over America and around the world are getting awfully damn tired of being defrauded by this obviously blatant data manipulation.
So NYPD, there’s a big fish out there waiting for you! There’s enough evidence out there to put him away for years.

"**Christmas is often a frantic time for travel, with people rushing across the UK to be with loved ones for the holiday season.**
But now that Covid restrictions will be eased from 23 to 27 December, public transport is expected to be even busier than normal, as travel for the holidays is compressed into a five-day window.
And this year there will be no squeezing on to a packed train carriage. Trains, coaches and planes are all running at reduced capacity to allow for social distancing, with tickets often needing to be booked in advance.
The prospect of public transport being unable to cope with demand has prompted the government to appoint a Christmas travel tsar - Network Rail chairman Sir Peter Hendy.
He is assessing whether road, rail and air networks are prepared enough for the onslaught of travellers during the festive window.
Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said plans were being made to minimise disruption, with further details being published next week ""once demand is clearer"".
He has warned that people should plan their routes carefully - and even consider not travelling at Christmas at all.
So what should you do if you're going to travel this year to spend Christmas with loved ones, and how might services be affected?
As is standard every year, there are no train services running on Christmas Day and only a very limited number of services running on a small number of routes on Boxing Day.
But for the days passengers can travel, they are being urged to book ahead and avoid busy times due to the combination of reduced capacity and the limited travel window. And some operators will prevent passengers from boarding without a pre-booked ticket.
There have already been reports of advance tickets selling out or going for exorbitant prices.
The good news is that operators say more advance tickets will soon be available, blaming the current shortage on changes to the timetable caused by the pandemic.
But the bad news is that tickets are expected to sell fast.
The Rail Delivery Group, which represents operators, advised people to keep checking for tickets and consider signing up for notifications from rail operators, some of whom will confirm when more fares are available.
Avanti West Coast, which operates trains on the West Coast Main Line, has said it is suspending peak fares between 18 December and the end of the year to help maintain social distancing on its trains.
This will slash the cost of many journeys on its network - for example, passengers buying a fully-flexible fare from Manchester to London during what is usually a peak period will be charged Â£64.40 instead of Â£180.
Mr Shapps has also revealed there are plans to run longer trains on the rail network, though we're yet to hear specifics about which routes these are planned for.
There are also annual Christmas rail works to contend with - though the majority of the network has been cleared of engineering works in a bid to avoid disruption.
However, Network Rail engineering works are taking place from 23 December to 4 January, with some railway lines closing to allow the work to take place.
London King's Cross station will be closed for six days from Christmas Day as a Â£1.2bn upgrade of the East Coast Main Line continues.
Network Rail is also warning of a ""significantly reduced service"" from 25 December to 4 January between Clapham Junction and London Waterloo because of major work.
But work scheduled for the festive period will be reviewed if passenger demand is high. However, government sources say it is unlikely that the major works on the East Coast Main Line and London King's Cross will be altered.
With trains likely to struggle with demand, coach operator National Express has said it will increase its services in the run-up to Christmas, having seen a ""significant"" increase in traffic to its website since the Christmas Covid rules were announced.
However, this still amounts to a reduced service, the operator said, with this year's Christmas Day timetable covering about 55% of the locations compared with 2019.
The operator said it will focus on major cities, towns and airports and expects demand for services to grow as more guidance about what we can do over Christmas is released by the government.
Megabus also said it had seen an increase in bookings over the past few days and expected demand to continue to grow.
Both will have a role in the mass exodus of students from universities between 3 and 9 December, aimed at minimising the risk of them spreading Covid-19 to their home areas.
Megabus said extra seats will be available from all the largest university campuses, cities and towns for students travelling home for Christmas, including Manchester, Birmingham, Nottingham, Oxford, Newcastle, Sunderland, Middlesbrough, Sheffield, Leeds, Norwich, Cardiff and Bristol.
National Express said it had increased capacity its usual routes that serve university locations and was speaking with universities about the possible need for special services.
Both operators will have services on Christmas Day.
Mr Shapps has also said the government is relaxing rules to allow more types of coaches to run over the festive period.
One upside for those travelling by road is that there are likely to be fewer roadworks than normal over the Christmas period.
The transport secretary said 500 miles of roadworks had been cleared on motorways and A-roads to ease any congestion.
Melanie Clarke, customer service director for Highways England, said the ""current plan"" was to remove ""non-essential"" roadworks from 20 December to 4 January 2021.
The RAC said its breakdown team is planning for the roads to be busy during the five-day period when coronavirus restrictions are eased, though it said it ""remains to be seen"" what the appetite for journeys would be this year.
The AA said it was not ""overly concerned"" that traffic congestion would occur on roads.
A survey it conducted found two-fifths of drivers had already cancelled festive travel plans.
EasyJet said it had already taken the decision to increase the number of seats on offer between London and Belfast, and London and Scotland over the Christmas period.
""We are operating flights in line with demand, which we will be monitoring over the coming days and are able to adjust our flight schedule accordingly,"" a spokesman said.
British Airways said it had seen an uptick in the numbers of people visiting its website looking at flights and holidays.
A spokesman said it would be putting on larger aircraft if needed, ""where possible"".
But Irish airline Aer Lingus said it would be operating a ""much-reduced schedule"" due to a ""lack of demand"" for air travel.
However, it said additional capacity had been added to key routes including Dublin to London Heathrow over the Christmas period."

 **Washington Needs to Adjust to the New Global Reality**



Historians agree that Britain’s rise as a pre‐​eminent global power came as a response to changing circumstances and not as a part of a grand master plan; Britain, it has been said, stumbled into an empire. But the converse was also true: the dismantling of the British Empire wasn’t a linear process involving a manageable and steady decline in its military and economic power; instead it had a haphazard muddling through quality. British leaders weren’t aware that Rule Britannia was already history even after the fat lady had sung that it was over.



Indeed, Prime Minister Winston Churchill who had led his nation into an impressive military victory in World War II, confident that the defeat of Nazi Germany would help save the British Empire, failed to recognize that the enormous military and economic costs of the war had actually created the conditions for the liquidation of the empire, starting with the withdrawal from Palestine and the “loss” of India after the war.



But while the sun was setting on the British Empire, members of its political elite continued to live under the illusion that their nation had remained a paramount global power. If you traveled in a time machine to London 1949 and attended a debate in the British Parliament, browsed through the pages of the _Times_ or listened to a BBC news program you would come across numerous references to Britain as a Great or “superpower,” a term that was applied to the United States and the Soviet Union after World War II. And if you encountered diplomats in His and (after 1953) Her Majesty’s Diplomatic Service and bankers in the City of London, you wouldn’t be surprised if they continued to behave as though the world was still their domain to rule.



It was the humiliating abandonment of the Anglo‐​French invasion of Suez in collusion with Israel in 1956 that proved to be the turning point in Britain’s retreat from empire and ensured that London would never again attempt global military action without first securing the acquiescence of Washington. The time lag between the effective end of the British Empire and the recognition that indeed it was all over, proved to be quite lengthy.



The concept of “recognition lag” is familiar to economists. It refers to the time lag between when an actual economic shock, such as a sudden boom or bust, occurs and when it is recognized by economists, central bankers and the government, like when officials signal a recession in the economy several months after it has actually begun.



And just like changes in economic conditions, changes in the global status and power of nations, are not always immediately apparent, especially to the politicians and the generals who yield that power and to the journalists who cover them. That the elites continue to share such misconceptions about their nation’s ability to exert global influence has less to do with the power of inertia and more with the vested interests they have in maintaining the status‐​quo that could be threatened by challenges at home and abroad.



While no one is comparing the global political, economic and military status of the United States to that of Great Britain after World War II, there is an eerie resemblance between the resistance of officials, lawmakers and pundits in London 1949 and that of their contemporary counterparts in Washington 2009 to adjust their nation’s foreign policies to the changing global balance of power. That may explain why so many members of the U.S. foreign policy establishment seem to be so depressed in face of the Obama Administration’s current difficulties in dictating global developments, ranging from the military quagmires in Iraq and Afghanistan, Iran’s nuclear aspirations and the deadlocked Israel/​Palestine peace process to the stalled negotiations on global trade liberalization (the Doha Round), the efforts to reach an international agreement on climate change and the global financial imbalances between the U.S. and China. Where is U.S. leadership on this or that global policy issue? Why can’t the Obama Administration “do something” to resolve this or that international crisis?



As expected, neoconservative critics depict President Barack Obama as an idealistic peacenik, if not a 1930’s-style appeaser. They blame the perceived erosion in U.S.’ ability to call the shots around the world on Obama’s alleged failure to stand‐​up to Russia (by abandoning the missile shield program in Eastern Europe), to Iran (by trying to engage it), to Venezuela (by shaking hands with Hugo Chavez) and to Al Qaeda (by overturning torture practices), and on his supposed betrayal of allies (Israel, Georgia, Poland, the Czech Republic). Not to mention Obama’s refusal to launch new crusades against Islamofascism, to promote the Freedom Agenda in the Greater Middle East and to annoy the commies in Beijing on a regular basis.



That’s rich coming from the guys at the _Weekly Standard_ and the American Enterprise Institute (AEI). After all, it was the mess that the Bush administration, guided by these neoconservatives, had made in the Greater Middle East — where US military power was overstretched to the maximum, and where American policies helped strengthen Iran and its surrogates in Iraq, Lebanon and Palestine — coupled with the dramatic loss of American financial resources, that has produced a long‐​term transformation in the balance of power in the Middle East and worldwide, and has significantly eroded Washington’s geo‐​strategic and geo‐​economic clout. In fact, the increasing wariness of the American public regarding new US military interventions, as a consequence of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the expanding U.S. deficits would have made it difficult even for a President John McCain to promote an aggressive U.S. policy in the Middle East and elsewhere.



That Obama finds it so difficult to press Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu, Iran’s Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Afghanistan’s Hamid Karzai to change their policies may have to do with the fact that unlike many of the elites in Washington, the above and other foreign leaders have succeeded in deconstructing the current geo‐​strategic reality and recognized that the global balance of power has been shifting and that U.S. ability to exert its diplomatic and military leverage over them has been constrained. Let’s hope that these changes will also be recognized in Washington as soon as possible, and that unlike the leaders of the British Empire, those in charge of Pax Americana will have enough time to readjust to the new global reality.

"**The government's Test and Trace app has given a women the results of a Covid test she said she had not taken.**
Elaine Watson, from Middlesbrough, was told by the app to self-isolate for seven days and then, on day six, that her test had come back negative.
""I'm thinking, what do you mean a test? I haven't had a test,"" she said.
The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said the app was constantly being improved in response to feedback but most users had ""no issues"" with it.
Ms Watson, a member of BBC staff, said she was not contacted by Test and Trace and had not taken a coronavirus test because she had no symptoms.
""Was that message meant for somebody else? Did I really need to isolate?"" she asked.
Other people have said they were sent results for tests they had not taken and some have taken a test but received no result.
Alex Weedon, from Colchester, was emailed by Test and Trace to say he had coronavirus, despite not having taken a test.
Trying to track down who the intended recipient had been was ""baffling"", he said.
Test and Trace has failed to contact about 19% of people whose cases have been passed to it after testing positive.
Between 28 May, when it launched, and 18 November nearly 17% (160,569) were not contacted. For 20,091 of these, ""communication details not provided"" was given as the reason.
The DHSC said everyone who tested positive was informed, but it was not clear on how a person's contact details could become ""not provided"" between them being informed and their case being passed to contact tracers.
British Medical Association North East chairman Dr George Rae asked why contact tracers could not call the person on the number used to text them their results.
""That doesn't make any sense at all, does it?"" he said.
One contact tracer from Teesside, who wished to remain anonymous, said he was not able to reach about 60% of the people he tried to contact.
""It is probably even higher than 60% that aren't reached, but I try to be at least a little optimistic,"" he said.
Another contact tracer said there was ""no clear guideline"" on how many attempts should be made before giving up.
If a person could not be reached there was no way of knowing whether the tracer had the correct number, he said.

"Three years ago, government plans to privatise the forests met with strong opposition from community groups and NGOs.  But there have been calls for change – among others the Woodland Trust has called for legislation that would afford the public forest estate greater protection from privatisation, and there are expectations that the Queen’s Speech will include an announcement of proposed legislation to “conserve and enhance” the forests. We will learn more about the government’s intention in upcoming weeks, but it takes only a bit of history to have mixed feelings about the proposition. It has to do with the words “conserve and enhance”. And it has to do with the government. Forests were subjects of government control long before states were thinking about things like income taxes. Rulers have tried various approaches over the centuries, and usually these shed a revealing light on their overarching ambitions. Show me your woodlands, and I will tell you what your government is up to. Authorities can focus on wood or game for hunting, they can over-exploit forests or preserve them for future generations, or they can reduce oversight and allow people to do their thing. And unlike many politicians, woodlands have a long memory, and they do not lie. Forests bear the effects of past policies over many generations.  A strong European tradition has focused on timber production, and securing a reliable supply of timber was a matter of national and economic security. Countries with a powerful state administrations such as Germany and France were particularly eager to manage their woodlands systematically. They issued edicts for wood production, controlled supplies and markets, and created government-run schools for foresters. For most of world history, rulers have shown their power by cutting down forests, because of their value as a resource and because forests were places where people could escape their control. European governments were different, and displayed power by preserving forests and guiding their use in what they perceived as the common interest. In other words, they sought to “conserve and enhance” the forests. Sound familiar? Governments of the early modern era strongly favoured timber production, as selling forest products was an important source of revenue. That had consequences for the way forests looked, as the quest for timber products favoured tall and fast-growing species. It also meant a ban on all non-monetary uses – specifically the traditional allowances for locals to make use of forest resources. This led to generations of conflict between governments and the people for control of the forests. Over the course of the 19th century, many European governments gained the upper hand and controlled the woodlands, but it became a rather ambiguous victory. The penchant for tall, fast-growing trees brought with them a wide range of problems. Game hunters voiced their own concerns, preserving a whiff of feudalism into the modern era. Nature lovers sought to preserve views and landscapes. And it is a matter of debate whether optimising domestic wood production was a good idea in an age of world trade. Forests mirrored society’s obsessions almost as reliably as those of the government. Environmentalism has made the issue even more complicated. Forests are hotspots of biological diversity. Climate change will affect tree growth, and introduce different pests, while also highlighting their potential as carbon sinks. Strong winds or ice can cut down elaborate forest management plans overnight. In spite of strenuous efforts against acid rain, pollution is still a major problem. Nitrogen oxides have received some attention for their impact on the climate, but they also contribute to a chronic over-fertilisation of soils that puts habitats in jeopardy by boosting unnatural growth. Governments can no longer choose what they perceive as the crucial use of forests and ignore all other claims. Today’s governments need to meet a multitude of goals: economic viability, scenic value, resilience to disasters, climate effects, biodiversity, and all this when the ground is constantly shifting. We do not know Britain’s climate in 50 years, or the effects of higher carbon dioxide concentrations on forests. Nor, looking from the environmental to the economic, can we guess what timber prices will be in 2064. So this makes it remarkable that the government wants to pick up the issue – but then it remains to be seen what “conserving” and “enhancing” forests actually means. Will they face up to challenge in full, or merely focus on monetary returns? There is plenty of evidence around the world to show what neo-liberal policies and short-term thinking can do to forests, and equally plenty of evidence of protests against it. We will learn soon more about the government’s idea of the right forest. We may also see another round of protests. But then, we will also learn something about ourselves in the process: we are out in the woods when it comes to the future of forests. Maybe we do not so much need a bill as an invitation to experts and the public: we need to talk."

"The shutting down of society as we know it is giving a lot of time for reflection, not least in fashion circles. In an interview in the design magazine Dezeen, the influential trend forecaster Li Edelkoort has called it a “quarantine on consumption” that is having a devastating impact on our economy and culture, but ultimately offers “a blank page to a new beginning”. While sections of the fashion industry already knew they could not continue on their current trajectory, it was inconceivable that brands could be forced to slow down, let alone stop production altogether. But that is what has happened as famous names from Prada to Zara have turned their production lines to making medical gowns and masks, and luxury houses have changed from making perfume to sanitisers. It’s an unprecedented interruption of an industry that has relied on speeding from one season’s sales to the next. And it is bringing with it a new sense of connectedness, responsibility and empathy.  Until factories started to feel the effects of Covid-19, the global fashion business was producing 150bn items of clothing each year, far in excess of the needs of a global population of 7.9 billion. Clothing consumption globally was in 2017 projected to rise still more, by 63% by 2030, according to the Global Fashion Agenda and Boston Consulting Group. Who knows if those projections will be dented now that bricks-and-mortar shops are closed, orders have halted and supply chains have been stopped in their tracks? As factory orders dry up, the lowly paid, overworked garment workers without sick pay or any financial cushion are the ones who are paying the biggest price. The question is how, when the self-isolation and fear abates, we can use this temporary moratorium on production to correct the course of a carbon-guzzling and exploitative industry. We cannot continue down this path of unchecked overproduction, waste and human misery. On Saturday, people around the world will be reflecting on the temporary decrease in CO2 as they turn off their lights at 8.30pm (local time wherever they are), to take part in Earth Hour. This annual environmental campaign by WWF will remind us that, according to the UN, we have only 10 years to keep global warming to 1.5C. This is something the academics Kate Fletcher and Mathilda Tham are acutely aware of. In their new report, Earth Logic Fashion Action Research Plan, they write: “The time frame of 10 years is the same as a child’s time at school. One eighth of most people’s lifetime, or 10 annual reports for a business. Consider what you, your family, community, workplace will do in the coming 10 years. Every moment will count.” Their argument pivots around the idea that the only way to ensure we cut carbon emissions and end the cycles of overproduction and waste is to imagine a whole new system that places the Earth’s needs before those of industrial growth. In a post-Covid-19 world, that’s beginning to look slightly more feasible. “We propose planet before industry as a radical idea in which the health and survival of our planet Earth is given precedence over business interests,” they write. The coronavirus pandemic has brought into stark focus the fact that business as usual can be stopped in its tracks. Anything, it seems, is now possible. According to the environmental journalist and broadcaster Lucy Siegle, who wrote the foreword to the Earth Logic report, this break is a “lifeline” to the industry and a “chance to reboot our efforts and change our course based on evidence and fact”. “Once we realise that the current system is always going to be self-limiting as there are finite resources, putting Earth first is the only option,” says Fletcher, of the London College of Fashion’s Centre for Sustainable Fashion. This is not about tinkering around the edges of the existing way of working, creating “sustainable” collections or clothing recycling schemes: Earth Logic attacks the very root of the problem: the existing economic model itself. This means a shift from production to the maintenance, use and care of existing clothes. It means reducing the volume of clothes we produce, and in turn, the amount of resources we are using. It means moving from globalised, tangled and unsafe supply chains to small production centres based around the needs and desires of local communities. “We need to find a role for industry scattered across communities,” says Fletcher, with multiple local hubs for people to be educated, to make and repair their clothes.  Patriarchy and growth logic are inextricably intertwined, says Tham. The same sorts of people are making the same sorts of decisions. According to Earth Logic, there would be respect for “fashion in non-western geographies. We can train the focus of fashion on supporting race and gender equality. Each perspective offers new models and practices for relating with fashion as well as broadening and diversifying the base of fashion expertise.” These are all points the next generation coming into the industry is demanding, too. “The questions students are asking are very different now,” says Tham, who teaches fashion and economics students at the Linnaeus University, Sweden. How we design clothes must connect with the needs of society and the environment and work with them, not against them. We are seeing this happening with designers looking for ways to help make protective equipment and gowns for medical teams. These new positive role models must be allowed to lead the way forward. We have uncertain and painful times ahead. But Fletcher says: “It’s about trying not to look away when the going gets hard.” We are seeing that in times of real emergency, people’s behaviour has to change. Even pressing pause on fashion’s relentless cycle for a season (possibly two) will have a profound effect. Already, so much has changed. The cycle of fashion for fashion’s sake has been broken. We must use this time to rethink how this industry can be redesigned with respect for the planet and the health of the people who work in it.  “It’s like turning a kaleidoscope and seeing new patterns emerge,” says Tham. “There are so many possible patterns. Things can change very quickly when we have a new perspective. It is not impossible.”"

"Everything feels new, unbelievable, overwhelming. At the same time, it feels as if we’ve walked into an old recurring dream. In a way, we have. We’ve seen it before, on TV and in blockbusters. We knew roughly what it would be like, and somehow this makes the encounter not less strange, but more so. Every day brings news of developments that, as recently as February, would have felt impossible – the work of years, not mere days. We refresh the news not because of a civic sense that following the news is important, but because so much may have happened since the last refresh. These developments are coming so fast that it’s hard to remember just how radical they are. Cast your mind back a few weeks and imagine someone telling you the following: within a month, schools will be closed. Almost all public gatherings will be cancelled. Hundreds of millions of people around the world will be out of work. Governments will be throwing together some of the largest economic stimulus packages in history. In certain places, landlords will not be collecting rent, or banks collecting mortgage payments, and the homeless will be allowed to stay in hotels free of charge. Experiments will be underway in the direct government provision of basic income. Large swathes of the world will be collaborating – with various degrees of coercion and nudging – on a shared project of keeping at least two metres between each other whenever possible. Would you have believed what you were hearing? It’s not just the size and speed of what is happening that’s dizzying. It’s the fact that we have grown accustomed to hearing that democracies are incapable of making big moves like this quickly, or at all. But here we are. Any glance at history reveals that crises and disasters have continually set the stage for change, often for the better. The global flu epidemic of 1918 helped create national health services in many European countries. The twinned crises of the Great Depression and the second world war set the stage for the modern welfare state. But crises can also send societies down darker paths. After the terrorist attacks of September 11, government surveillance of citizens exploded, while George W Bush launched new wars that stretched into indefinite occupations. (As I write this, the US military’s current attempt at reducing its troop presence in Afghanistan, 19 years after the invasion, is being slowed by coronavirus-related complications.) Another recent crisis, the 2008 financial crash, was resolved in a way that meant banks and financial institutions were restored to pre-crash normality, at great public cost, while government spending on public services across the world was slashed. Because crises shape history, there are hundreds of thinkers who have devoted their lives to studying how they unfold. This work – what we might call the field of “crisis studies” – charts how, whenever crisis visits a given community, the fundamental reality of that community is laid bare. Who has more and who has less. Where the power lies. What people treasure and what they fear. In such moments, whatever is broken in society gets revealed for just how broken it is, often in the form of haunting little images or stories. In recent weeks, the news has furnished us with countless examples. Airlines are flying large numbers of empty or near-empty flights for the sole purpose of protecting their slots on prime sky routes. There have been reports of French police fining homeless people for being outside during the lockdown. Prisoners in New York state are getting paid less than a dollar per hour to bottle hand sanitiser that they themselves are not allowed to use (because it contains alcohol), in a prison where they are not given free soap, but must buy it in an on-site shop. But disasters and emergencies do not just throw light on the world as it is. They also rip open the fabric of normality. Through the hole that opens up, we glimpse possibilities of other worlds. Some thinkers who study disasters focus more on all that might go wrong. Others are more optimistic, framing crises not just in terms of what is lost but also what might be gained. Every disaster is different, of course, and it’s never just one or the other: loss and gain always coexist. Only in hindsight will the contours of the new world we’re entering become clear.  The pessimistic view is that a crisis makes bad things worse. People who study disasters – and especially pandemics – know all too well their tendency to inflame xenophobia and racial scapegoating. When the Black Death came to Europe in the 14th century, cities and towns shut themselves to outsiders – and assaulted, banished and killed “undesirable” community members, most often Jews. In 1858, a mob in New York City broke into a quarantine hospital for immigrants on Staten Island, demanded that everyone leave and then burned the hospital down, fearful that it was putting people outside at risk of yellow fever. Wikipedia now has a page collating examples from more than 35 countries of “xenophobia and racism related to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic”: they range from taunts to outright assault. “In a totally rational world, you might assume that an international pandemic would lead to greater internationalism,” says the historian Mike Davis, a renowned American chronicler of the disasters incubated by globalisation. For Davis, who wrote a book about the threat of avian flu in 2005, pandemics are a perfect example of the kind of crises to which global capitalism (with its constant movement of people and goods) is particularly vulnerable, but that the capitalist mindset (with its inability to think in terms beyond profit) cannot address. “In a rational world, we would be ramping up production of basic essential supplies – test kits, masks, respirators – not only for our own use, but for poorer countries, too. Because it’s all one battle. But it’s not necessarily a rational world. So there could be a lot of demonisation and calls for isolation. Which will mean more deaths and more suffering worldwide.” In the US, President Trump has tried hard to brand the new coronavirus as inherently “Chinese”, and to use the pandemic as a pretext for tightening borders and accepting fewer asylum seekers. Republican officials, thinktanks and media outlets have claimed or implied that Covid-19 is a man-made Chinese bioweapon. Some Chinese officials, in turn, have pushed the conspiracy theory that the outbreak came to China by way of American soldiers. In Europe, the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, recently announced: “We are fighting a two-front war: one front is called migration, and the other one belongs to the coronavirus. There is a logical connection between the two, as both spread with movement.” When you’re fighting a war, you want to know as much about the enemy as possible. But it’s easy, in the rush of crisis, to put in place surveillance tools without thinking about the long-term harm they might do. The scholar Shoshana Zuboff, the author of The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, reminded me that, prior to 9/11, the US government had been in the process of developing serious regulations designed to give web users real choice about how their personal information was and wasn’t used. “In the course of a few days,” Zuboff says, “the concern shifted from ‘How do we regulate these companies that are violating privacy norms and rights’ to ‘How do we nurture and protect these companies so they can collect data for us?’” For governments looking to monitor their citizens even more closely, and companies looking to get rich by doing the same, it would be hard to imagine a more perfect crisis than a global pandemic. In China today, drones search for people without facemasks; when they are found, the drones’ built-in speakers broadcast scoldings from police. Germany, Austria, Italy and Belgium are all using data – anonymised, for now – from major telecommunications companies to track people’s movement. In Israel, the national security agency is now allowed to access infected individual’s phone records. South Korea sends texts to the public identifying potentially infected individuals and sharing information about where they’ve been. Not all surveillance is inherently malign, and new tech tools very well might end up playing a role in fighting the virus, but Zuboff worries that these emergency measures will become permanent, so enmeshed in daily life that we forget their original purpose. Lockdowns have made many of us, sitting at home glued to our computers and phones, more dependent than ever on big tech companies. Many of these same companies are actively pitching themselves to government as a vital part of the solution. It is worth asking what they stand to gain. “People have a hard time remembering privacy rights when they’re trying to deal with something like a pandemic,” says Vasuki Shastry, a Chatham House fellow who studies the interplay of technology and democracy. “Once a system gets scaled up, it can be very difficult to scale it back down. And then maybe it takes on other uses.” In the space of a few weeks, the prime ministers of both Israel and Hungary have effectively been given the power to rule by decree, without interference from courts or legislature. Meanwhile, the UK’s recently rolled-out coronavirus bill gives police and immigration officers the authority – in place for the next two years – to arrest and detain people suspected of carrying the virus, so that they can be tested. The US Department of Justice has, since the outbreak began, filed a request with Congress for a new rule that would allow judges to suspend courtroom proceedings in emergencies, creating the possibility of people being jailed without ever being able to formally object. “Those of us who follow the police know how this goes,” said Kevin Blowe of Netpol, a UK group focused on protest rights. “These powers get put in place, and it sounds reasonable enough at the time – and then very quickly they’re applied for other purposes that have nothing to do with democracy and nothing to do with public safety.” In a 2008 report on the legal aspects of pandemic response, prompted by the increase in pandemic flu outbreaks, a team of historians and medical ethicists assembled by the American Civil Liberties Union bemoaned a common tendency – resurgent, in their view, since 9/11 – for government to address public health problems using mindsets more appropriate to tracking down criminals. This suspicious mindset, they argued, ended up most affecting racial minorities and the poor. Tactics like these can make fighting the disease harder, by driving a hard wedge of distrust between government and citizens. As the report put it: “People, rather than the disease, become the enemy.” There’s another school of thought that looks at crisis and sees glimmers of possibility. For thinkers in this camp, the example of the 2008 financial crash looms large. But where, from their view, 2008 led to defeat – with the broad public giving up a great deal while a small few profited – Covid-19 might open the door to political progress. “I think we’re just so different to how we were before we saw the aftermath of the 2008 crash,” said the American writer Rebecca Solnit, one of today’s most eloquent investigators of crises and their implications. “Ideas that used to be seen as leftwing seem more reasonable to more people. There’s room for change that there wasn’t beforehand. It’s an opening.” The argument, in its simplest form, is this: Covid-19 has revealed the political status quo to be broken. Long before anyone had heard of the new coronavirus, people died of diseases we knew how to prevent and treat. People lived precarious lives in societies awash with wealth. Experts told us about catastrophic threats on the horizon, including pandemics, and we did next to nothing to prepare for them. At the same time, the drastic measures governments have taken in recent weeks testify to just how much power the state does have – the extent of what government can accomplish (and quickly!) when it realises it must act boldly or risk being seen as fundamentally illegitimate. As Pankaj Mishra recently wrote: “It has taken a disaster for the state to assume its original responsibility to protect citizens.” For years, in mainstream politics the conventional line – on everything from healthcare to basic living expenses such as housing – has been that even if the world has its problems, expansive government intervention is not a feasible solution. Instead, we have been told that what works best are “marketplace” solutions, which give large roles to corporations motivated not by outdated notions like “the public good” but by a desire to make a profit. But then the virus started spreading, governments spent trillions in days – even going so far as to write cheques directly to citizens – and suddenly the question of what was feasible felt different. From this perspective, the task today is not to fight the virus in order to return to business as usual, because business as usual was already a disaster. The goal, instead, is to fight the virus – and in doing so transform business as usual into something more humane and secure. In her 2009 book, A Paradise Built in Hell, Solnit used case studies of disasters – including the 1985 Mexico City earthquake, the 2001 terror attacks and Hurricane Katrina – to argue that emergencies aren’t just moments when bad things get worse, or when people inevitably become more scared, suspicious and self-centred. Instead she foregrounded the ways in which disasters opened up human reserves of improvisation, solidarity and resolve, pockets of purpose and joy, even in the midst of loss and pain. The book was not a call to celebrate disaster – but to pay attention to the possibilities it might contain, and how it might shake us loose from old ways. In Solnit’s telling, “official” disaster responses had a tendency to muck things up by treating people as part of the problem to be managed, not an invaluable part of the solution. Sometimes this mismanagement is a result of mere incompetence – other times it is more sinister. In her 2007 book, The Shock Doctrine, the Canadian writer Naomi Klein laid out a dark account of crisis politics. In Klein’s view, there is always Disaster 1 – the earthquake, the storm, the military conflict, the economic slump – and Disaster 2 – the bad things that people with power subsequently get up to, such as ramming through extreme economic reforms or gobbling up post-crisis opportunities for self-enrichment, while the rest of us are too dazed to notice. (In fact, Klein argued, these people sometimes engineer Disaster 1 to get the process started.) Unlike Solnit’s book, The Shock Doctrine doesn’t have much to say about the resilience of everyday people when everything goes horribly wrong. (Indeed, Solnit directly criticised Klein for this omission.) But the two books fit together like puzzle pieces. Both address crisis not in terms of what inevitably – or “naturally” – happens as they unfold, but in terms of choices that people make along the way. And both were well-timed to contribute to the political conversations taking shape in the rubble of the financial crash. In 2008, days after Barack Obama’s election, his chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, famously said: “You never want a serious crisis to go to waste.” Today’s leftists, for whom Obama mostly represents disappointment, are prone to agree. They feel that, in the wake of recent crises, they lost, and now is the time to make amends. If, facing a pandemic, we can change this much in a few weeks, then how much might we change in a year? For anyone making this argument, the contrast between 2008 and the present crisis is striking. Compared to the opaque financial crisis, with its credit default swaps and collateralised debt obligations, the coronavirus is relatively easy to understand. It is a dozen crises tangled into one, and they’re all unfolding immediately, in ways that cannot be missed. Politicians are getting infected. Wealthy celebrities are getting infected. Your friends and relatives are getting infected. We may not quite all be “in it together” – as always, the poor are hit worse – but there is more truth to the idea than there ever was in the wake of 2008. In this, the optimists believe, there is hope that we might begin to see the world differently. Maybe we can view our problems as shared, and society as more than just a mass of individuals competing against each other for wealth and standing. Maybe, in short, we can understand that the logic of the market should not dominate as many spheres of human existence as we currently allow it to. “More people are in a position to connect the dots,” Klein said. “It has to do with people’s experiences; for people of a certain age, their only experience of capitalism has been one of crisis. And they want things to be different.” That screaming buzzsaw noise in the background of this conversation is the sound of the climate crisis. If 2008 is the disaster that Klein and like-minded thinkers want to avoid repeating, climate change is the much bigger disaster they see coming – that they know is already here – and that they want to fight off. Indeed, in the years since publishing The Shock Doctrine, Klein has made climate change her central focus, framing it as the paradigmatic emergency that must be wrenched from the clutches of fossil-fuel profiteers and their enablers in government. Although Covid-19 is likely the biggest global crisis since the second world war, it is still dwarfed in the long term by climate change. Yet the two problems have suggestive similarities. Both will require unusual levels of global cooperation. Both demand changes in behaviour today in the name of reducing suffering tomorrow. Both problems were long predicted with great certainty by scientists, and have been neglected by governments unable to see beyond the next fiscal quarter’s growth statistics. Accordingly, both will require governments to take drastic action and banish the logic of the marketplace from certain realms of human activity, while simultaneously embracing public investment. In other words, to think of this new level of state intervention as a temporary requirement is to ensure that we continue barrelling down the path to climate disaster. “We’ve been trying for years to get people out of normal mode and into emergency mode,” said Margaret Klein Salamon, a former psychologist who now heads the advocacy group The Climate Mobilization. “What is possible politically is fundamentally different when lots of people get into emergency mode – when they fundamentally accept that there’s danger, and that if we want to be safe we need to do everything we can. And it’s been interesting to see that theory validated by the response to the coronavirus. Now the challenge is to keep emergency mode activated about climate, where the dangers are orders of magnitude greater. We can’t think we’re going to go ‘back to normal’, because things weren’t normal.” The analogy between the two crises only goes so far. There is no getting around the fact that the impacts of climate change are more gradual than those of Covid-19. Most people do not feel they or their loved ones could die from the climate crisis this month, and so emergency mode is harder to activate and sustain. As Salamon pointed out to me, if we truly accepted we were in a climate emergency, then every day the news would lead with updates about which countries were reducing their emissions the fastest, and people would be clamouring to make sure their leaders were adopting the policies that worked. But it is not unimaginable that the experience of Covid-19 could help us understand climate change differently. As the virus has reduced industrial activity and road traffic, air pollution has plummeted. In early March, the Stanford University scientist Marshall Burke used pollution data from four Chinese cities to measure changes in the level of PM2.5, a particularly harmful pollutant that attacks the heart and lungs. He estimated that, in China alone, emission reductions since the start of the pandemic had in effect saved the lives of at least 1,400 children under five and 51,700 adults over 70. Meanwhile, people around the world have been sharing their own anecdotal findings online – stories of sweet-smelling breezes, expanded bike lanes and birdsong returning to neighbourhoods – in a way that almost resembles a digitally distributed Rebecca Solnit project: people catching glimpses, in the midst of a disaster, of a future they know they want and need. Alongside these hopeful signs, a far less heartening story is unfolding, which fits Klein’s “shock doctrine” framework. Disaster 1: Covid-19. Disaster 2: the dismantling of even the meagre existing rules designed to protect the environment. On 26 March, following lobbying from the energy industry, the US Environmental Protection Agency announced that, in recognition of the pandemic’s effects on the workforce, it will not punish violations of pollution regulations so long as companies can link those violations to the pandemic. China’s environmental ministry has started waiving inspections that assess the environmental impact of industrial facilities. And advocacy groups funded by the plastics industry have launched a public relations blitz on behalf of single-use plastic bags, spreading the unproven claim that the virus is less likely to stick to plastic than to the cloth fabric of reusable bags. Looking back at the crisis of 2008, we can see that emissions dropped then, too – only to rebound drastically in 2010 and 2011. Salamon believes that one lesson of the coronavirus crisis is the power of shared emotion, which has helped make possible radical action to slow the pandemic. “I’m not talking about people giving each other medical expertise. I’m talking about people calling each other up and saying: ‘How are you doing? Are you scared? I’m scared. I want you to be OK, I want us to be OK.’ And that’s what we want for climate, too. We need to learn to be scared together, to agree on what we’re terrified about.” Only then, she said, would governments be forced to act. “It’s good that we’re entering emergency mode about the pandemic,” she said. “But unless we also do it for climate … ” She didn’t finish the sentence. What kind of actions would it take for the optimists’ vision to materialise? The historian Philip Mirowski, author of Never Let a Serious Crisis Go to Waste: How Neoliberalism Survived the Financial Meltdown, warns against complacency. “The left thought it was so obvious to everyone that the crisis revealed the utter bankruptcy of a certain way of looking at the economy,” he told me. “And it wasn’t obvious to everyone, and the left lost.” How do we prevent the world from going back to a version of the way it was before Covid-19, with the virus vanquished but all of the old ongoing disasters still unfolding? “The political outcome of the epidemic,” said Mike Davis, “will, like all political outcomes, be decided by struggle, by battles over interpretation, by pointing out what causes problems and what solves them. And we need to get that analysis out in the world any way we can.” One major obstacle, of course, is social distancing, which certainly hinders many time-tested methods of waging such struggles, such as political canvassing and street protest. “The biggest risk for all of us,” said Klein, “is going to be frittering away this time sitting at home on our social media feeds, living the extremely limited forms of politics that get enabled there.” Davis hoped protesters would find their way into the streets sooner rather than later, and speculated that a street action with all the sign-holding participants spaced 10 or 15 feet apart would make a dramatic media image. He lives in San Diego, and as our conversation wrapped up, he mentioned that he was planning to spend part of the afternoon doing his part by standing by himself on a street corner, holding a sign. He hadn’t decided what to write on it yet, but was thinking about “SUPPORT THE NURSES’ UNION” or “DEMAND PAID SICK LEAVE”. Solnit told me she was taking heart from all the new ways people were finding to connect and help each other around the world, ranging from the neighbourhood delivery networks that had sprung up to bring groceries to people who couldn’t get out, to more symbolic interventions, such as kids playing music on an older neighbour’s porch. The Italian political scientist Alessandro Delfanti said he was finding hope from a post-outbreak wave of strikes roiling Amazon warehouses in the US and Europe, and also the steps that workers across different sectors of the Italian economy were taking to help each other secure equipment they needed to stay safe. What happens next might depend on the optimists’ ability to transport such moments of solidarity into the broader political sphere, arguing that it makes no sense to address Covid-19 without at least trying to fix everything else, too, creating a world where our shared resources do more for more people. “We don’t even have a language for this emotion, in which the wonderful comes wrapped in the terrible, joy in sorrow, courage in fear,” wrote Solnit in A Paradise Built in Hell. “We cannot welcome disaster, but we can value the responses, both practical and psychological.”  The world feels awfully strange right now, but not because – or not just because – it is changing so fast and any one of us could fall ill at any time, or could already be carrying the virus and not know it. It feels strange because the past few weeks have exposed the fact that the biggest things can always change, at any minute. This simple truth, both destabilising and liberating, is easy to forget. We’re not watching a movie: we’re writing one, together, until the end. • This article was amended on 31 March. An earlier version incorrectly stated that Mike Davis lives in Hawaii.

The Nobel Peace Prize long has distinguished itself for its dubious choices. Most of the past recipients are unknown today: no one remembers their supposed contributions to world peace.



Other selections make little sense. UNICEF collected the award nearly five decades ago — a worthy agency, perhaps, but not one that promoted “peace” as commonly understood. Similar were later choices of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the group Doctors Without Borders. The International Campaign to Ban Landmines promotes an appealing cause, but one which might actually make war more likely by limiting use of a defensive weapon.



Henry Kissinger and Le Duc Tho were jointly recognized for negotiating the “end” of the Vietnam War, which simply led to more fighting and the collapse of South Vietnam a few years later. Guatemalan Rigoberta Menchu Tum was cited for her efforts on behalf of “social justice” rather than peace; she later was found to have falsified her story. Al Gore and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change shared a highly political award for highly partisan environmental activism which did not promote peace.



More worthy was Mikhail Gorbachev, though his diplomatic partner, Ronald Reagan, probably should have shared the award. Muhammad Yunus of the Grameen Bank pioneered a new strategy for development, but it had nothing to do with peacemaking. Then there was the 2009 prize for Barack Obama, who had done nothing on behalf of peace; ironically, in the last three years the president has reversed the famous 1960s slogan and used his power to “make war not love.”



Now the Nobel Committee has chosen the European Union.



At least the Committee included the word “peace” in its official explanation, that the EU had promoted “peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rights” around the world. However, with the common currency zone in crisis and opposition growing to greater centralization of power in Brussels, the Nobel Committee — hailing from Norway, which does not belong to the EU — appeared to have a more political purpose in mind for the award.



Committee Chairman Thorbjorn Jagland explained: “we saw that the prize could be important in giving a message to the European public of how important it is to secure what they have achieved on this continent.” However, he doesn’t just believe that the EU as organized is important. Resolving the economic challenge was necessary in order “that European unity can be kept so that Europe can move forward.” That is, toward ever greater central control with more power consolidated in Brussels. In Europe, at least, there is no other definition of progress. The Eurocrats who dominate politics, the media, academia, and business believe it is not enough to urge people across the continent to voluntarily cooperate. They must be forced to do so if necessary.



Naturally, EU officials were delighted with the award. Two of the organization’s three “presidents,” Herman Van Rompuy and Jose Manuel Barroso, declared that the award “shows that in these difficult times the European Union remains an inspiration for leaders and citizens all over the world.” Well, in Norway at least. Jagland admitted that he wants his nation to join the EU. But few other peoples or governments appear to be rushing to emulate the attempt by European elites to impose an ever more powerful yet unaccountable centralized bureaucracy on nominally democratic states.



The EU began decades ago as a small organization to promote economic cooperation. Its emphasis was breaking down trade barriers: indeed, the organization once was known as the “Common Market,” a worthy endeavor that helped tie formerly warring European states together. Over time the organization expanded to 27 states and took on new political responsibilities. Although the principal cause of peace was profound horror at war after two monstrous, murderous conflicts which killed tens of millions, the growing ties through the EU did draw nations into a tighter embrace.



However, the organization has been less successful in promoting peace outside of its core members. Weirdly, Jagland lauded the EU as a peacemaker in the Balkans: “We have to remember it was not that many years ago that these people were slaughtering each other on the streets.” Yet European governments, most notably Germany, _helped trigger the Balkans crisis_ by, for instance, offering premature recognition for seceding territories. And the EU proved unable to limit, let along stop, the murderous violence once it erupted.



As the Balkans descended into war Jacques Poos, the foreign affairs minister of Luxembourg and president of the Council of the European Union, grandly declared: the “hour of Europe is at hand.” But Europe could do nothing. Yet again the continent called on aid from across “the Pond.” The Dayton agreement which ended Bosnia’s civil war was called the Dayton Agreement because it was negotiated in… Dayton, Ohio in a process led by U.S. officials.



In Kosovo EU governments, acting through NATO, did little more than hold Washington’s coat as it bombed the Serbs, ultimately forcing Kosovo’s independence. Europe played a significant occupation role only after the U.S. had ousted Belgrade’s military forces. Nor has this process led to stability. The ethnic Albanians brutally purged a quarter million ethnic Serbs from the new country and most of the latter who remain continue to resist their forcible incorporation in what has been a quasi‐​gangster state.



Moreover, there was an even more important factor in the maintenance of peace for Europe which the Nobel Committee entirely ignored: the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. NATO has outlived its original purpose, but it was famously said that the alliance was intended to keep the Americans in, the Germans down, and the Russians out. The result was to ensure Europe’s security.



The poor, suffering American taxpayers continue to defend the Europeans from phantom threats even though long ago the latter were well able to protect themselves. Today the EU has a larger population and GDP than America. Although the EU played an important role in the continent’s peaceful development, the U.S. spent so much for so long to provide a military wall behind which Western Europe could prosper. A Nobel “shout‐​out” to the American people would seem to be in order.



It is also worth noting how the EU fails to live up to its own grand rhetoric as well as that of the Nobel Committee. Forget the petty corruption, political abuse, and endemic waste. That is what government is everywhere and always about. Forget the destructive continental selfishness, such as the Common Agricultural Policy, which wastes money on a prodigious scale — even worse than U.S. food programs — subsidizing farmers in rich countries while devastating farmers in poor countries. Forget the nonsensical regulation, under which, for instance, a British grocer who insisted on using old imperial weights for his produce was arrested. Forget even the self‐​serving propaganda and sanctimony with which the Eurocratic elite baptizes its every action.



The worst failing of the EU is its direct assault on democracy and accountability. Maybe the Eurocrats would do a better job than the citizens in governing the continent. However, people have a right to rule themselves. And that is precisely what so many European leaders are determined to prevent.



The chief problem is not the EU’s response the Eurozone crisis. For instance, the spokeswoman for Greece’s left‐​wing opposition party Syriza called the award “an insult to the people of Europe themselves, who currently are experiencing an undeclared war as a result of the barbaric, anti‐​social austerity policies that are destroying social cohesion and democracy.” One can debate the wisdom of the EU’s Euro strategy, but no one forced Athens to borrow so much money, implement such foolish policies, or request a bail‐​out. In fact, much to Brussels’ dismay the Greeks insisted on holding elections, which resulted in a new government determined to work with the rest of the EU. The organization was irresponsible in admitting Greece to the Eurozone, since everyone knew that Athens was lying about its economic status, policies, and prospects. But allowing the Greeks to hang themselves doesn’t constitute a “war.”



Where the elites are at war with the people is on expansion of the organization’s authority. The public is not enthused. A recent Eurobarometer poll found that trust in the EU had fallen to 31 percent, from 57 percent just five years ago. But if there is one constant in European politics, it is that the Eurocrats never take “no” for an answer. The ultimate objective is a consolidated, continental government based in Brussels. If that requires overriding the public’s will, so be it.



For many years there has been pressure at the top for creation of a far more centralized quasi‐​nation state, a de facto “United States of Europe.” In 2004 leading Eurocrats drafted a constitution to transform what remained a loose federation into something closer to a continental government. It was a complex document which proposed to shift responsibilities, or “competencies,” from national governments to Brussels, limit national vetoes over EU decisions, create a High Representative for Foreign Affairs and a European foreign service, and establish a “president,” the President of the European Council.



The document generated much enthusiasm in Brussels, but far less elsewhere. Constitutional change required popular approval, and voters in France and the Netherlands promptly said no. The Eurocrats could have accepted the people’s judgment. Could have, but naturally refused to do so. Former French President Valery Giscard d’Estaing, who played a lead role in drafting the new document, learned a different lesson: “Above all, it is to avoid having referendums.” Of course.



So the EU leadership moved a few commas and jumbled the text a bit, making the document even more abstruse, and then reissued it as a treaty which only required parliamentary approval. With the fix in, every national parliament promptly gave its assent to the so‐​called Lisbon Treaty. Except in Ireland, where the constitution required a referendum.



To the shock and horror of the usual suspects, in June 2008 Irish voters rejected the agreement. How dare the people say no to what Europe’s enlightened leadership had so selflessly negotiated! For exercising their democratic rights the Irish were called “extremely arrogant” by one British Labor MP — who, of course, had been elected by British citizens exercising their democratic rights. German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, who now serves as Finance Minister and thus chief enforcer of financial orthodoxy against Greece and other Euro‐​delinquents, complained that “a few million Irish cannot decide on behalf of 495 million Europeans.” Of course, he believed that just a few thousand Europeans, the ruling class centered in Brussels and capital cities across the continent, should do the deciding.



Again, the Eurocrats could have accepted the people’s decision. Not that any of them considered that idea any longer than it took to reject it. Thought was given to tossing the ungrateful Irish out of the EU or turning them into second class members. But the Eurocrats decided that Ireland should simply vote again — and get the decision right this time. The EU spent generously on propaganda while organization officials flooded the small nation warning of catastrophe should the Irish say no. On the verge of a continental economic crisis, Brussels insisted that only more centralized power could maintain Irish prosperity. This time a majority of Irish voters did as demanded.



It seemed that Brussels’ moment for time in the sun finally had come. Wrote Gideon Rachman of the _Financial Times_ : “some European leaders allowed themselves to dream of a new world order — one in which the European Union was finally recognized as a global superpower, to rank alongside the U.S. and China.” The EU surmounted a few final speed bumps, such as the refusal of Czech President Vaclav Klaus to be rushed in signing his nation’s ratification, and the Lisbon Treaty took effect.



Finally impatient Eurocrats were able to divide the political spoils. Characteristically, they choice the undistinguished and unknown Van Rumpoy — a former Belgian prime minister most celebrated for his penchant for writing Japanese haiku — over internationally known candidates such as former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. _Times_ columnist Brownen Maddox observed: “The haggling over Europe’s new top jobs resembles that old children’s card game of mixing up the heads, bellies and feet of different animals, for a deliberately preposterous result.”



Among the “new EU’s” first controversies was deciding which European “president” would be the first to shake President Barack Obama’s hand and which would be able to sit next to him at the U.S.-EU summit, scheduled for May 2010 in Madrid. The meeting later was cancelled by Washington officials who embarrassed Brussels by deciding that it would be a waste of time.



The Nobel award has created a similar problem for the EU today. Jagland said that the organization would “have to decide what leader will come and receive the medal.” That decision could trigger a mini‐​war. Messers Barroso and Van Rompuy naturally laid claim to the privilege. So did Martin Schulz, president of the European Parliament. The Lisbon Treaty was supposed to have answered Henry Kissinger’s famous question, what is the phone number to call Europe? But the agreement merely intensified bureaucratic rivalries. The Nobel compromise likely will involve these three and perhaps more officials together on stage or nearby.



Despite the praise of the Nobel Committee, the EU remains an unloved artificial construct at war with the principle of self‐​government. Outside of those on the EU payroll, no one flies the EU flag, looks to the European Commission for leadership, or feels loyalty to Brussels. Real politics in Europe remains national: even votes cast for candidates to the European Parliament have virtually nothing to do with continental issues and everything to do with local politics. Czech President Klaus shocked an uncomprehending European Parliament when he diagnosed the problem: “There is no European demos — and no European nation,” which intensifies the problem of “the democratic deficit, the loss of democratic accountability, the decision‐​making of the unelected.” Such an organization is a dubious candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize.



Still, nothing seems to cool the ardor of the Eurocrats for their “European Project” creating a true continental government. Is the Eurozone in danger of falling apart? No worries. Just concentrate more power in Brussels. Commission President Barroso said: “Once again, we can see that a crisis can accelerate decision‐​making when it crystallizes political will. Solutions that seemed out of reach only a few years or even months ago are now possible.” If that is what most Europeans want they should have it, of course. But there’s no evidence that is what most Europeans want.



The formation of the EU occurred as Europeans were growing closer. Nevertheless, despite the Eurocrats’ best efforts the EU has not eliminated national feelings or erased differences in national history, tradition, and culture. Far more than language divides European states, and those differences are far greater than the differences among American states. At the most basic level, no one roots for a European “football” (soccer) team; to the contrary, the bitterest rivalries are among European squads.



And now the Eurocrisis is spurring nationalist antagonism. Greeks are tired of having to pay for their past mistakes; Germans are tired of having to subsidize Greeks for the latter’s past mistakes. Protests against EU‐​imposed austerity continue to spread while Berlin is accused of setting up a Fourth Reich. Of the Eurocrisis, warned Mark Leonard of the European Council on Foreign Relations, “economically, culturally and politically, it is driving Europe apart.”



A cooperative Europe is good for the continent and the world However, increasingly the EU is less a shared enterprise than a mandated order, imposed on the masses by elites determined to take whatever steps are necessary, including preventing the people from voting on the new superstate being constructed in Brussels. Where it will end is impossible to predict. But contrary to the Nobel Committee’s hopes, unpopular and artificial systems imposed from above rarely result in genuine and lasting peace.

Share this...FacebookTwitterLooking back at the Spiegel archives, here’s another report warning of global cooling and that man was the cause: The desert is growing.
There are some very familiar sounding excerpts (my emphasis):
Undisputed is that the desert is growing…the Sahara in some places has expanded southwards by 48 km…24 million people in Mauritius, Senegal, Mali, Niger and Chad are threatened with starving to death.
Meteorologists and climate scientists have another reason for the catastrophe: the changing world climate.
…Not only in the Sahel region, but also in Northwest India and over Hokkaido…the summertime monsoons have been almost completely absent since 1970.
…The climate in the northern hemisphere, explained Dr. Reid Bryson, Director of the Institute for Environmental Studies at the University of Wisconsin, is cooling slowly but steadily. After the the mean temperature made a step upwards since the turn of the century, there’s been a comparably rash temperature drop over the last 20 years: On average temperature dropped from 16 to 15,7°C (see graphic).
For Iceland, which is considered to be a sensitive climate indicator, Bryson and Icelandic meteorologist Berg Torssen calculated the climate changes back to 900 A.D. … Since the middle of this century, average temperatures dropped faster than at any time over the last 1000 years, by around 1°C.
At the same time the climate in the huge cold zones of the North, Canada and Siberia are getting frostier…for Central Russia, where the year before last the ‘coldest temperature in several hundred years’ was registered.

The cold blocking in the north, the skeptics of the climate change theory argue, has caused the west wind zone, which supplies Europe’s middle latitudes with Atlantic lows, to drift southwards.”
In the report, Spiegel blames the monsoons on the breakdown of atmospheric circulation, adding:
Indeed the start of the dry periods coincides timewise with about with the northern hemispheric cooling. Monsoon precipitation in the Sahel Zone has dropped by more than 50% since 1857.”
So many weather extremes back then, too? Today the Sahel Region is greening. Spiegel saves the best for last:
The cold trend, calamitous forthe monsoon countries, is likely because of the industrial countries, according to US meteorologist Gene Wooldridge — through pollution of the atmosphere with soot and aerosols.
The veil of pollution allows less sunlight to shine through, which leads to fewer and fewer rain clouds forming over the oil-contaminated Atlantic.”
Climate changed naturally throughout history. But since about 1900, it’s all man’s fault. We live in an age of technical charlatans.

"Governments around the world are declaring “climate and environmental emergencies” to highlight the unsustainable ways in which humans, over a few generations, have transformed the planet. We’ve made enough concrete to cover the entire surface of the Earth in a layer two millimetres thick. Enough plastic has been manufactured to Clingfilm it as well. We annually produce 4.8 billion tonnes of our top five crops and 4.8 billion head of livestock. There are 1.2 billion motor vehicles, 2 billion personal computers, and more mobile phones than the 7.6 billion people on Earth. Globally, human activities move more soil, rock and sediment each year than is transported by all other natural processes combined. Factories and farming remove as much nitrogen from the atmosphere as all Earth’s natural processes and the global climate is warming so fast that we have delayed the next ice age. We’ve entered the Anthropocene and left behind the stable planetary conditions of the past 10,000 years that allowed farming and complex civilisations to develop. Today’s globally interconnected network of cultures relies on a stable global environment. So how do we design national and international policies to deal with this global climate and environmental emergency? A study in Nature Sustainability recently attempted to summarise and evaluate the different types of policies that could be used to save our environment.  The study is based on the planetary boundaries concept developed by a team of academics led by sustainability researcher Johan Rockström and Earth system scientist Will Steffen. They defined nine physical environmental boundaries that, if exceeded, could result in abrupt changes and serious repercussions for human civilisation.  We’ve already crossed three of these boundaries by changing the climate, destroying biodiversity and disrupting the nitrogen and phosphorus cycles through agriculture. This study focused purely on physical limits to human life on Earth and didn’t deal with the underlying dynamics of consumer capitalism which govern most of human life. In contrast, economist Kate Raworth combines the physical and social needs of humanity by including water, food and health alongside education, employment, and social equality. Between these two sets of needs is a just operating space for humanity.  Living within this space, according to Raworth, demands inclusive and sustainable economic development, which is becoming known as “donut economics”. At a fundamental level, it means we design our economic policies to look after the planet and everyone on it. The Nature Sustainability study focuses on command and control policies such as taxes, subsides and fines, instead of looking at what is driving consumption. Essentially, the authors apply old policies to try and fix the problem of the Anthropocene, which given its scale, needs a whole new set of ideas. One of these is universal basic income (UBI) – a policy that would guarantee a financial payment to every citizen, unconditionally, without any obligation to work, at a level above their subsistence needs.  Small-scale trials of UBI show that educational attainment is higher, healthcare costs go down, entrepreneurship levels both in numbers of people and success rates go up, as does self-reported happiness. However, UBI does more than this: it could break the link between work and consumption.

      Green New Deal: universal basic income could make green transition feasible


 Breaking this could, if carefully managed over time, dramatically reduce environmental impacts by slowing the treadmill of producing and consuming things that currently fuels untrammelled economic growth. We could work less and consume less, and still meet our needs. Fear for the future would recede, meaning we wouldn’t have to work ever harder for fear of having no work in the future. This is especially important as automation and intelligent machines will increasingly compete with humans for most jobs. One argued use for UBI would return anything not spent by people to the original pool, meaning the money can’t be saved. Wealthy people may not use it at all, but it would guarantee that essentials are affordable for the poorest. UBI therefore eliminates extreme poverty and reduces dependency. It gives people the agency to say “no” to undesirable work, including much environmentally damaging work, and “yes” to opportunities that often lie out of reach. With UBI we could all think long term, well beyond the next pay day. We could care for ourselves, others, and the wider world, as living in the Anthropocene demands. A second radical policy of environmental repair could come from the simple but profound idea that we allocate half the Earth’s surface for the benefit of other species. “Half-Earth” is less utopian than it first appears.  By 2050, over two thirds of the world’s population will live in cities. We have become an urban species, with the world outside the major cities becoming increasingly wilder. There is an opportunity to return this land to its pre-human wild state through rewilding. Mass-scale forest restoration is already underway, with commitments across 43 countries to restore 292m hectares of degraded land to forest – ten times the area of the UK. UBI would give people the right to choose when it comes to fulfilling their own basic needs. Rewilding Earth does the same for other species’ needs – we would provide the conditions for them to thrive and to manage their own well-being. Instead of relying on 20th-century ideas, we need carefully designed policies that could push society towards a new mode of living in a new epoch.  Surviving the Anthropocene means breaking the cycle of production and consumption undermining the conditions which have allowed our global network of complex civilisations to flourish. Our global climate and environmental emergency will not be solved by modest changes to taxes. Bolder changes would mean we can change the way we live to radically reduce suffering and allow people and wildlife to flourish. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter.

"**A Suffolk Tory MP said he would argue the case for the county to be moved to a lower tier of Covid-19 restrictions ""because that's where we should be"".**
The government said Suffolk would be in tier two - high alert when England's lockdown ends on 2 December.
The county has the fourth-lowest virus case rate - behind the Isle of Wight, Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly, which will all be in the lower tier.
Dan Poulter MP said he was a ""little disappointed to be frank"".
Mr Poulter, who represents Central Suffolk and North Ipswich, said there was a ""very good case"" for Suffolk to be in tier one - medium alert.
""My view, and I communicated this to the government, was that there's a good medical argument and good evidence that we should be in tier one,"" he said.
""I will continue to make the case for Suffolk... I hope this can be looked at again,"" he said.
People in tier two cannot socialise with other households indoors., although restrictions have been eased for Christmas, between 23 and 27 December only.
The ""rule of six"" will apply to gatherings outdoors, and pubs and restaurants will shut at 23:00 GMT and only be allowed to serve alcohol as part of a meal.
Health Secretary Matt Hancock said despite his own West Suffolk constituency having the lowest case rate for over-60s in the whole country, Suffolk as a whole needed to be in tier two ""to get the virus further under control"".
The county's current infection rate of 85 cases per 100,000 people was more than double what it was when Suffolk entered tier one on 14 October, Suffolk Public Health said.
At the beginning of September, there were just five cases per 100,000 people.
Parts of Suffolk, such as Ipswich and Hadleigh, have been seeing much higher numbers of positive cases than anticipated. the body said.
Stuart Keeble, director of public health at Suffolk County Council, said: ""I fully understand many people will be disappointed that Suffolk has not emerged from the national restrictions in a lower tier, or indeed no tier at all. I am too.
""The facts facing us today are clear however. With current infection rates and pressure being put in health services, we need to do more of what we have been doing. We need to stick with it.""
Most of England will be in the two toughest tiers of coronavirus restrictions at the start of December.
It has been met with criticism ahead of a Commons vote on Tuesday, with a group of Tory rebels calling the plan ""authoritarianism at work"".
The government said it would be regularly reviewed.

"The motor industry has been accused by campaigners of trying to use the coronavirus crisis to avert stricter environmental regulation, after correspondence showed carmakers had lobbied the EU to defer impending laws. The European carmakers’ association, ACEA, and other groups representing the supply chain called on the EU to delay implementing regulations because the pandemic had affected its “plans to comply”. Laws due to come into effect include tougher targets on vehicle CO2 emissions. In a letter to the EU commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, the groups said production and sales of cars had stalled in many countries and companies were facing a cash crisis. While appealing for more financial aid to maintain liquidity, the ACEA said activities such as development and testing would inevitably suffer, which “upsets the plans we had made to prepare ourselves for complying with existing and future EU laws and regulations within the applicable deadlines”. It said: “We believe therefore that some adjustment would need to be made to the timing of these laws. Please be assured, however, that it is not our intention to question the laws as such nor the underlying objectives of road safety, climate change mitigation and protection of the environment.” European laws on CO2 emissions of new vehicles have applied since 2015 and a further tightening of the rules is due in January 2021. Manufacturers could potentially face huge fines for non-compliance, although the targets have pushed production towards less polluting cars. Campaigners described the call as shameless. Greenpeace UK’s executive director, John Sauven, said: “Many industries are facing difficulties during this challenging period that require governments and corporations to protect their workers. But it would be a mistake to use this crisis as a reason to roll back on environmental regulations. One, it won’t suddenly restart car sales, and two, tackling one crisis can’t be done at the expense of another one.” Julia Poliscanova, the clean vehicle director at Transport and Environment, said: “The priority now is to ensure the health, safety and job security of the workers affected by the current factory closures. While the overall economic recovery is crucial, we shouldn’t let some opportunistic carmakers use the crisis to shamelessly roll back the EU climate targets for cars. Selling less cars won’t impact compliance with the law. What matters is the type of car you sell.” The big German carmakers Daimler, VW and BMW have already indicated they are aiming to comply with the new CO2 targets regardless of the current situation. The ACEA director general, Eric-Mark Huitema, said the industry was not questioning any specific laws or the underlying objectives of tackling the climate emergency. He said: “The primary concern of ACEA and all its members right now is to manage the immediate crisis facing the auto industry, which has essentially come to an abrupt halt – something the sector has never experienced before. “In this emergency context, it has not yet been possible to undertake a detailed analysis of the implications of this crisis on legislation affecting our industry. [But] there will inevitably be consequences in this domain.” The European commission said it would respond to the letter from the car manufacturers in due course. However, the commission made it clear that the European green deal, announced last December and the flagship policy of von der Leyen, would continue. The green deal will encompass all aspects of European industry, transport and environmental regulation, and require steep emissions reductions to meet the intended bloc-wide goal of net zero emissions by 2050. A spokesperson said: “The commission is determined to use all the policy tools at its disposal to help protect citizens and mitigate the coronavirus pandemic’s severely negative socioeconomic consequences. We must also ensure that the recovery is as sustainable as possible – both economically and environmentally.” Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the UK-based Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said: “Manufacturers are committed to meeting all necessary safety and environmental regulations, but we cannot forecast how this crisis will unfold or what new requirements may be needed.” As governments prepare rescue packages for industry and stimulus packages amounting to trillions around the world, some experts are concerned that emergency stimulus money will prop up fossil fuel companies, and are calling for the spending to come with conditions attached to ensure companies must pursue a greener path. However, the coronavirus crisis has led to calls from some quarters to weaken environmental regulations and ignore CO2 reduction targets. In the US, the Environmental Protection Agency has announced a rollback of certain regulations, and in the UK there have been calls for tax breaks and the removal of emissions obligations."
"**Bristol's biggest sports stadium has been earmarked as a site for mass coronavirus vaccinations.**
Ashton Gate, home of Bristol City FC and the Bristol Bears rugby team, will become the regional vaccination centre for the city and surrounding area.
It is predicted as many 110,000 people per week could be be vaccinated there, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS).
Regulators have yet to approve a vaccine.
If one is approved the Ashton Gate programme would prioritise people over 50, and frontline health workers.
The plan was in a report presented to University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Trust (UHBW) board on Friday.
Robert Woolley, chief executive of UHBW, which runs the Bristol Royal Infirmary, Bristol Children's Hospital and Weston General, told board members preparations were ""moving very fast.""
""It [vaccine approval] is subject to Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority approval but if that is fast tracked as we expect then we are gearing up to be able to start vaccinating staff and any other priorities that are advised to us nationally in December.""
According to the report, Ashton Gate would be open 12 hours a day, seven days a week and the programme would be overseen by North Bristol NHS Trust (NBT).
Patients from Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire would be vaccinated at the stadium.
Jenny Bowker, head of primary care development for the Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire CCG, said that everyone over 50 and other high-risk groups would be seen first, with over-80s and care home residents and staff at the front of the queue.
Addressing South Gloucestershire Council's Health Scrutiny Committee on 25 November, she said GPs should be ready ""within weeks"" to take part in vaccinations, although it was not certain which vaccine would be available first."

"**An Isle of Man coronavirus support charity has announced a financial assistance package for self-isolating students returning for Christmas.**
The Manx Solidarity Fund has offered Â£250 to help pay for alternative accommodation away from home.
Anyone arriving on the island is required to self-isolate for 14 days along with their whole household.
A spokesman for the fund said the money would go to those with a ""genuine financial need"".
Further government aid, equivalent to Â£250 a week, is available on a one-off basis to all returning residents.
A spokeswoman for the Manx Student Union said the announcement was a ""pleasant and welcome surprise"" and would be ""vital"" for any in low-income households.
""While self-isolating away from the family home is technically a choice, it is simply not practical for many Manx students,"" she added.
A recent government survey indicated that more than 90% of those in further education off-island planned to return for the Christmas period.
To be eligible for the financial assistance, students must stay in accommodation on the government's accredited isolation list.
A spokesman for the fund, which was set up to support people who have been impacted by coronavirus restrictions, said applications would be verified together with the education department's grant team.
Education Minister Alex Allinson said the aid was ""generous"" and would help anyone who ""may be struggling financially"" with accommodation and living expenses.

There is no more reliable rule than the 95% rule: 95% of what you read about economics and finance is either wrong or irrelevant. Just reflect for a moment on the most frequently repeated lessons drawn from the Great Depression (1929–33). According to most accounts, the stock market crash of October 1929 was the spark that sent the economy spiraling downward.



How could this be? After all, by November 1929, the stock market had started to recover, and by mid‐​April 1930, it had reached its pre‐​crash level. Contrary to the received wisdom, massive government failure — not the stock market crash — pushed the United States into the Great Depression. It was the Federal Reserve that ushered in that terrible nightmare. During the course of the Great Depression, the money supply contracted by 25%. This sent the economy into a deflationary death spiral, with the price level falling 25%.



The Federal Reserve was not the only culprit. In the name of saving jobs, the Smoot‐​Hawley trade bill became law in June 1930. That intervention increased U.S. tariffs by over 50%. It was quickly followed by the imposition of retaliatory tariffs in 60 other countries. In consequence, world trade collapsed and the unemployment rate in the U.S. surged from 7.8% in June 1930 to 24.7% in 1933.



In addition to the Smoot‐​Hawley tariff wedge, the Hoover administration and the Democratic Congress imposed the largest tax increase in U.S. history, with the top tax rate on income jumping from 25% to 63% in 1932. If these government policies weren’t destructive enough, the Roosevelt administration’s New Deal created regime uncertainty because major policies were being changed so rapidly. As a result, investors were afraid to commit funds to new projects and private investment collapsed.





Far from saving the patient, government intervention came close to killing it. But you wouldn’t know it from listening to the current discourse about the Panic of 2008-09. Indeed, politicians and pundits throughout the world have unfortunately dialed back to the Great Depression and drawn on the false lessons of history for policy guidance and justifications for their mega‐​interventions.



In consequence, the key enabler of both the Great Depression and the Panic of 2008-09 — namely the Federal Reserve — is scheduled to become America’s systemic risk regulator. This is the world upside down. The Federal Reserve is the systemic risk.



The true lesson to be drawn from business cycle history is that, if left to run their natural course, severe downturns are followed by rapid snapbacks. For example, during the 1921 recession, wholesale prices, industrial production, and manufacturing employment fell by 30% or more, reaching their low in mid‐​1921. But, absent government intervention, the economy recovered naturally, and by early 1922, it had fully recovered, from its mid‐​1921 low.



Never mind. The crisis has energized the interventionists. One of the most hyper‐​active is French President Nicolas Sarkozy. In addition to leading the charge to impose wage controls on top bankers, he has grand visions. He wants to move away from the “fetichism of GDP”. The Sarkozy conjecture is that GDP metrics don’t measure “happiness”.



To correct that alleged flaw, President Sarkozy appointed a “Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress”. It is led by two Nobel laureates: Columbia University’s Joseph Stiglitz and Harvard’s Amartya Sen. The Commission’s report, which was issued in September 2009, presents the known shortcomings associated with national income accounting, including the GDP metrics. That said, the Commission failed to produce any new, reliable measures that account for overall economic health. The commission will, no doubt, go down as a typical Sarkozy fireworks display, with no measured “happiness” at the end of the performance.



For the foreseeable future, GDP metrics, as well as other standard economic measures, will remain center stage for economists and policy makers. President Hu of China made this clear in a speech on climate change before the U.N. General Assembly in September 2009. While bowing to “greenery”, China’s President Hu stressed that developing countries should “go for growth”.







This was a cold shower for President Sarkozy and other interventionists. After all, GDP growth and levels of GDP per capita are closely, and positively, associated with metrics that measure the vitality of free markets and the ease of doing business (see the accompanying table). And that’s not all. Economic growth is, quite literally, a matter of life and death. As the accompanying chart indicates, prosperity (measured by standard metrics) affects life expectancy (health) in a positive way.



A reliable picture of an economic state of affairs can be obtained by constructing a misery index using standard measures: the sum of the inflation rate, plus the lending (interest) rate, plus the unemployment rate, minus the annual percentage change in GDP per capita.



As an example, the misery index for New Zealand is presented in the accompanying chart for the period 1980–2008.



By the early 1980s, New Zealand’s economy was suffering from interventionism and its misery index was at record levels. Then Roger Douglas took over the reins at the Ministry of Finance and pushed through dramatic free‐​market reforms.



These set the stage for a significant initial fall in New Zealand’s misery index. The second stage of the decline in the index occurred during Ruth Richardson’s tenure as Minister of Finance in 1991–93, when she pushed through a number of additional liberal economic reforms. In late 1999, the Labour Party, with Helen Clarke at the helm, took power in New Zealand, where it stayed entrenched until November 2008. During that long stretch, the dramatic economic reforms of the late‐​1980s and early‐​1990s were eroded away and New Zealand’s misery index more than doubled.



President Hu took note of the main lesson of economic history: “go for free markets” and prosperity and longevity will follow.

What’s driving President Obama to hold the Keystone XL pipeline hostage? After all, it’s hard to see very much political gain from irritating labor into sitting out next November’s election, and the environmentalists he is pandering to are going to vote for him anyway.



Not only is there very little political gain, he’s also getting some pretty bad advice.



The principal government spokesperson on the scientific merit of the Keystone Pipeline appears to be NASA’s James E. Hansen, the man who lit the bonfire of the global warming vanities way back in 1988. Googling “Hansen Keystone Pipeline” yields about 5.1 million hits. “Holdren Keystone Pipeline,” the president’s (and, in the past, Mitt Romney’s) science advisor (John Holdren), is good for about 74,000.



As a result of his disproportionate influence, it’s high time to have an in‐​depth look at what Hansen advocates.



According to Jim, if the pipeline is built, it would be “game over” on climate change. If the Alberta tar sands oil that passes through the pipeline is combusted, Hansen says that we won’t be able to “to preserve a planet for our children and grandchildren”.



Really? For most of the last 100 million years, the atmosphere’s carbon dioxide concentration has been higher than it is now. Estimates vary on what maximum surface temperatures were reached, but there’s little debate that the angiosperms — the flowering plants that we ultimately depend upon for food — evolved during this time. It shouldn’t surprise anyone, including Hansen, that a warmer world with more carbon dioxide is a greener one. Indeed, NASA’s own satellites have detected this change already.



What about the dreaded rise of sea level? In the last interglacial, which lasted thousands of years, Greenland did not shed all of its ice. But Hansen has testified that it can do that in 100 years, raising sea levels 23 feet. Antarctica began accumulating ice maybe 20 million years ago, and the ice grew in an era of integrated higher temperatures far warmer than anything mere humans could produce.



Hansen’s “game over” is based upon the following interview, with SolveClimateNews last August.



SCN: Can you explain why you have said it’s “game over” on the climate front if the Keystone XL pipeline is built?  
  
JH: President George W. Bush said that the U.S. was addicted to oil…That is the question facing President Obama…  
  
If the United States is buying [Alberta tar sands oil], it surely will be going after oil in the deepest ocean, the Arctic, and shale deposits; and harvesting coal via mountaintop removal and long‐​wall mining. Obama will have decided he is a hopeless addict.



So, according to Dr. Hansen, if we drill for oil around the world, fracture (“frack”) shale deposits (which largely produces natural gas), and mine for coal, the planet is toast. Oh, and the President in an addict.



Just to be fair, let’s see what Hansen says we must and must not do. Here’s the current mix of energy sources for U.S. transportation, manufacturing, and electrical generation, according to the Energy Information Administration:





Over 80% of our energy comes from fossil fuels, which Hansen has said have to be eliminated. What’s to replace them? Nuclear power seems logical, but according to a landmark 2002 article in _Science_ by New York University’s Martin Hoffert, there simply isn’t enough U-235 available to meet our future; in addition, nuclear is not politically popular.



Guess that would leave the “renewables”, but not hydropower, which is also not politically correct. Wood is a nonstarter, as a shift to more of that cuts down forests and increases atmospheric carbon dioxide. The most popular biofuel, ethanol, results in more carbon dioxide emissions than are produced per unit energy by fossil fuels. Solar and wind suffer from nights and inconstancy.



Couple that to the fact that wind power is not very aesthetic. Just ask the hard greenies on Martha’s Vineyard, who rejected it. Add in that solar is the most expensive form of power production (about four times more costly than natural gas) and that it will never power Chicago or any other big northern city in the winter, and you have a dark, cold nation with very few cars.



Wind and solar also require equivalent backup generation to make up for inconstancy. Given that Hansen says that only addicts like the President would frack shale for gas, what is going to supply the backup?



The answer is that there currently is no source, in anything close to sufficient volume



Perhaps Hansen is simply lacking in common sense. Saying that the President is an addict if he does not follow his dictates, shows very little. But, then again, it’s President Obama. Ronald Reagan would have sacked him on the spot.

"**Leo Varadkar has said the Irish government is not planning to ban cross-border travel despite infection rates being higher in Northern Ireland.**
It had been reported he advised against cross-border travel to NI at Christmas.
NI First Minister Arlene Foster said she was ""astounded"" by the reports, after years of ""being lectured"" about the open border during Brexit talks.
But Mr Varadkar clarified there was ""no question of there being an outright travel ban between north and south"".
""It's not under consideration, not being discussed - period,"" he told the DÃ¡il (Irish parliament) on Thursday.
""We don't have a travel ban with Poland, we're certainly not going to have one with Northern Ireland,"" the tÃ¡naiste (Irish deputy PM) said.
But Mr Varadkar added that the government will continue to ask people not to move between counties.
The tÃ¡naiste further clarified that as the Republic of Ireland moves from level five to level three restrictions next week ""inter-county travel will still be restricted and will only be allowed for work, school or essential purposes like caring for an elderly relative"".
""So that means that inter-county travel including cross-border travel for shopping or visiting friends and relatives will not be allowed,"" he said.
He added that they hoped to be in a position to advise people that they can travel between counties, including Northern Ireland, in order to visit friends and relatives closer to Christmas, but that will depend on the epidemiological data at that point.
When asked about previous comments about cross-border travel, a spokesman for Mr Varadkar said the Fine Gael meeting where he was reported to have raised the issue was ""private"".
However, he referred to remarks Mr Varadkar made in the DÃ¡il on Tuesday about the ""real risk"" of north-south travel within Ireland.
The tÃ¡naiste referred to the higher infection rate in Northern Ireland and said the ""less intensive approach to the virus there, since the start, has its consequences"".
On Thursday afternoon, Northern Ireland's first and deputy first ministers were asked about the disparity in Covid regulations on both sides of the border and their effect on public compliance.
""I have to say I was astounded if not a little surprised that the tÃ¡naiste was indicating that people from the Republic of Ireland would not be able to travel to see their families in Northern Ireland during the Christmas period,"" First Minister Arlene Foster said.
""It appears that the border has made a reappearance again, after Northern Ireland being lectured for four years in the context of the European Union negotiations that the border was completely open.""
Ms Foster said Mr Varadkar's remarks were ""really regrettable"" and she called for ""good cooperation actually across the whole of the British Isles so that families can be together in appropriate way over the holiday period"".
Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said: ""Commonality of approach is key and I would much prefer we were far more aligned than we have been to date.""
She said the Irish government's position on Christmas restrictions would not be known until the outcome of a cabinet meeting in Dublin on Friday.
Before Mr Varadkar clarified his stance on cross-border travel, a Sinn FÃ©in spokesperson said closing the borders would show ""no awareness of the realities of the life along border communities, where family members live on both sides of the border and where tens of thousands cross the border daily to work, to go to school, or to access health and other services"".
SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said Dublin and Stormont should ""align our restrictions as far as possible north and south"" over Christmas.
The Republic of Ireland is five weeks into a six-week lockdown, during which people are living under the government's highest level of public health restrictions.
Northern Ireland's Covid regulations are less strict, but Stormont has imposed a two-week circuit breaker from Friday which, along with other measures, will see all non-essential retail close for the first time since the summer.
The circuit breaker was announced prior to a UK-wide agreement which will see rules relaxed across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland for a five-day period over Christmas.
Up to three families will be allowed to form exclusive social bubbles in the UK between 23 and 27 December.
When the agreement was announced on Sunday, UK ministers said they ""also recognised that people will want to see family and friends across the island of Ireland, and this is the subject of discussions with the Irish government""."

We are all aware of Stuff’s evangelistic global warming crusade where some weird individuals, who quite frankly are of little or no significance, actually believe they are celestial demigods when it comes to predicting the future of global warming. 



The first thing that struck me was that, by virtue of being employed by _Stuff,_ that immediately disqualified them from making the claim on their CVs of being journalists. A prophet, clairvoyant or even a palmist would more accurately represent their qualifications, yet we are expected to take them seriously and are not permitted to challenge their superior intellect. I am not the sharpest knife in the drawer, but my blade can determine the difference between slicing through a block of ice and the threading of newsprint.



Is climate changing? Possibly. Can humanity intervene? I don’t think so. There is a deliberate interweaving of global warming and the need to protect our environment and it is the annexing of these two issues that have diluted the urgency and our desire to take environmental issues more seriously. 



I have travelled throughout the world over many years; and the planet, quite frankly, is a dump. Man/woman-made filth. If governments and activists want to be taken seriously **they need to abandon this tripe about global warming and put their energy into fixing the environment.** It is only then that they should be acknowledged and believed. 



Humanity created the mess, so humanity can address it. Let mother nature do what she does best; she is the thermometer of the universe. Not _Stuff_ nor socialists.



15,000 readers responded to Stuff’s climate survey and 160,000 voted Green at the last election. When it’s likely that more than **90% of Green supporters ignored Stuff’s global warming survey** , you know your BS is spread very thin.

"**On Monday, the world heard how the UK's Covid vaccine - from AstraZeneca and Oxford University - was highly effective in advanced trials.**
It gave hope of another new jab to fight the pandemic that should be cheaper and easier to distribute than the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines that announced similarly impressive results just days before.
But after the jubilation, some negative press has followed.
On Thursday, multiple news outlets in the UK and US reported that there were questions over the data. They weren't about safety, but rather how effective the jab is.
The questions centre around efficacy levels.
Three were reported from the trial - an overall efficacy of 70%, a lower one of 62% and a high of 90%.
That's because different doses of the vaccine were mistakenly used in the trial. Some volunteers were given shots half the planned strength, in error. Yet that ""wrong"" dose turned out to be a winner.
Some of the shots were weaker than they were designed to be, containing much less of the ingredient that is meant to give a person immunity.
The jab is actually two shots, with the second given a month after the first as a booster.
While most of the volunteers in the trial got the correct dose for both of their two shots, some didn't.
Regulators were told about the error early on and they agreed that the trial could continue and more volunteers could be immunised.
The error had no effect on vaccine safety.
About 3,000 participants were given the half dose and then a full dose four weeks later, and this regime appeared to provide the most protection or efficacy in the trial - around 90%.
In the larger group of nearly 9,000 volunteers, who were given two full doses also four weeks apart, efficacy was 62%.
AstraZeneca reported these percentages and also said that its vaccine was, on average, 70% effective at preventing Covid-19 illness. The figures left some experts scratching their head.
Prof David Salisbury, immunisation expert and associate fellow of the global health program at the Chatham House think tank, said: ""You've taken two studies for which different doses were used and come up with a composite that doesn't represent either of the doses. I think many people are having trouble with that.â³
AstraZeneca stressed that the data are preliminary, rather than full and final - which is true for the reported Pfizer and Moderna jab results too. It is science by press release.
When they can, all of the companies will publish full results in medical journals for public scrutiny.
And they are submitting full data to regulators to apply for emergency approval so that countries can start using these three different vaccines to immunise whole populations.
The US regulator, called the FDA, have said any Covid vaccine needs to be at least 50% effective to be useful in fighting the pandemic.
Even if you take the lowest figure of effectiveness for the AstraZeneca jab, it still passes that benchmark.
The efficacy analysis was based on 131 cases of Covid-19 that occurred in the study participants:
The Oxford researchers are investigating why the weaker dose followed by a full one appeared to work better than two full ones.
One idea is that a low then high dose shot may be a better mimic of a coronavirus infection and lead to a better immune response.
But it is possible that the volunteers who got the half doses are somewhat different to those who got two big shots.
Moncef Slaoui, the scientific head of the US's Operation Warp Speed - the programme to supply America with vaccines - told US reporters that the half-dose group only included people younger than 55.
Since age is the biggest risk factor for getting seriously ill with Covid-19, a vaccine that protects the elderly is extremely important.
However, results from an earlier phase two study of the Oxford vaccine, published in The Lancet medical journal, showed the vaccine produced a strong response in all age groups.
An AstraZeneca spokesman said: ""As we communicated earlier this week, there is strong merit in continuing to further investigate the half-dose/ full dose regimen.
""We are further evaluating the data and will work with regulators on the best approach for further evaluation. This would add to data from existing trials which are currently being prepared for regulatory submission.""
Although the dosing was different, the rest of the study didn't change from the original plan.
Prof Peter Openshaw, an expert at Imperial College London, says the take home message should be that we have three very promising Covid vaccines that could soon become available to help save lives.
""We have to wait for the full data and to see how the regulators view the results.
""All we have to go on is a limited data release. The protection from the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine may be less than that from the mRNA vaccines, but we need to wait and see.
""It is remarkable that each of the trials that are now reporting shows protection, which we did not know was going to be possible.""
He added: ""We have been wanting vaccines for many diseases for a long time and they haven't arrived - HIV, TB and malaria being good examples.
""The results so far seem to show that it can be done for Covid-19, and that's very good news indeed."""
"Rising ocean temperatures could have pushed the world’s tropical coral reefs over a tipping point where they are hit by bleaching on a “near-annual” basis, according to the head of a US government agency program that monitors the globe’s coral reefs. Dr Mark Eakin, coordinator of Coral Reef Watch at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told Guardian Australia there was a risk that mass bleaching seen along the length of the Great Barrier Reef in 2020 could mark the start of another global-scale bleaching event.  Tropical coral reefs tend to be at a higher risk of bleaching during times when the Pacific Ocean is in a phase known as El Niño. The latest bleaching on the reef has hit during this cycle’s neutral phase. “The real concern is with this much bleaching without tropical forcing,” Eakin said. “This may be a sign we’ve now tipped over to near-annual bleaching in many locations.” “It’s quite concerning that we are getting this much heat stress across the Great Barrier Reef in an Enso [El Niño southern oscillation]-neutral year. “What we are seeing on the Great Barrier Reef and potentially elsewhere is really being driven just by anthropogenic climate change. “If we get another El Niño, the odds are almost 100% that we will see another global bleaching event.” Aerial surveys of 1,020 individual reefs completed across the length of the 2,300km marine park confirmed last week a third mass bleaching event in only five years. “That’s already pushing awfully close to near-annual bleaching,” added Eakin. It’s been a shitty, exhausting day on the #GreatBarrierReef.I feel like an art lover wandering through the Louvre....as it burns to the ground. pic.twitter.com/I0Mx7epLCe Corals bleach when they sit in abnormally hot water for too long. Reefs and corals can recover from mild bleaching, but severe and prolonged heat stress can kill corals. In back-to-back bleaching in 2016 and 2017, about half the reef’s corals died. Eakin said that in January Coral Reef Watch’s models were warning that heat stress would build across the reef in February and March. Sea temperatures over the Great Barrier Reef were the highest on record this February. Satellite data later confirmed the modelling results which, Eakin said, was received “with a sense of dread” among scientists. “I was not ready to have another bleaching event this quickly,” he said. Eakin said the agency’s modelling for the next four months was showing a “classic pattern of heat stress” that had preceded previous global bleaching events. Heat was predicted to rise first in the southern Indian Ocean, then to south-east Asia and into the Coral Triangle. He said it was “too early” to say if a global bleaching event was on the way, but “it would not really surprise me”. Eakin said that when severe bleaching causes mass mortality of corals, “those events take a decade or more for recovery. We are seeing these events far too frequently”. As the planet gains heat from increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, about 90% of that extra heat is taken up by oceans. In January, a study of heat down to 2km in depth concluded that 2019 was the warmest year on record. Eakin said ocean heat content data showed the world’s oceans were gaining heat. “There’s so much heat that has been absorbed in the upper ocean that all the coral reefs are much closer now to their bleaching threshold. As result, it’s very easy to tip them over.” Data from nine days of aerial surveys over the Great Barrier Reef, carried out in mid-March, are being analysed and compiled at the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University. Dr Neal Cantin, a senior coral biologist at the Australian Institute of Marine Science, said because of the warming of the oceans caused by climate change, “we are already committed to more frequent and more severe bleaching in the next decade”. Cantin said the Australian Institute of Marine Science would be carrying out monitoring of sites in the coming months to see which corals had survived this event and how 2020 had impacted recovery from previous bleaching. “We need to understand the full extent of significant mortality,” he said. Many areas of the Great Barrier Reef are known to have experienced severe bleaching this summer, likely killing many corals, but others, including tourist reefs near Cairns and the Whitsundays, only experienced mild bleaching. Most offshore reefs in the far north escaped bleaching entirely. “With mild bleaching, the animal survives but growth is slowed and they become more susceptible to disease,” said Associate Prof Tracy Ainsworth at the University of New South Wales. She said mild bleaching can also impact the ability of the corals to spawn which can slow recovery from impacts. “We have known for 20 years that probably by about 2020, we would start to see annual bleaching.” Eakin added: “Even if the corals don’t die, bleached corals are injured and starving and they are more susceptible to disease. They will also reduce their reproductive output in a bleaching year and the year after.” A 2019 study found bleaching in 2016 and 2017 had caused the numbers of new baby corals produced in 2018 to crash by 89%. Cantin said that unlike in 2016 and 2017, the bleaching in 2020 appeared to have covered “the entire system” of the Great Barrier Reef. Corals have a symbiotic relationship with algae that delivers nutrients and colour to the animal. “Completely white coral means it has lost probably 95-100% of their symbiont algae and they will struggle to recover,” Cantin said. “With moderate-level bleaching you will see the tips go white with some sections still having pigmentation left – they do have a good chance of surviving,” he said. The Great Barrier Reef’s values as a world heritage-listed location are due for review at a meeting scheduled in China in June. Unesco has said that meeting is under review due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In December 2019, Australia submitted a report to the committee that conceded climate change had impacted the reef’s values as a world heritage site since it was first listed in 1981."
"**Opposition MPs in Denmark have urged the government to dig up millions of mink that were buried in mass graves amid Covid-19 fears.**
The two burial sites in Jutland are highly controversial - one is near a bathing lake and the other not far from a source of drinking water.
The discovery of a mutated form of the virus prompted a cull of nearly 17 million mink, devastating the Danish fur industry - the largest in the EU.
The burial decision was judged illegal.
The new Agriculture Minister, Rasmus Prehn, said on Friday he supported the idea of exhuming the mink and incinerating them. But that would require the environmental protection agency's approval, he added.
His predecessor Mogens Jensen resigned last week in the furore over the government's legal basis for the cull, as more than 10,000 tonnes of dead mink were hastily buried.
Denmark's DR news reports that about 11 million mink have been culled so far.
**Warning: you may find a picture below showing a burial site disturbing**
The government has admitted that the cull was mishandled. The grisly mass burial got even more macabre when there were reports of buried mink resurfacing because of the nitrogen and phosphorus gases produced by their decay.
The two mass graves are near Karup and Holstebro.
Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen wept on Danish TV while visiting a mink farm on Thursday.
""We have two generations of really skilled mink farmers, father and son, who in a very, very short time have had their life's work shattered, and thatâ¦ It's been emotional for them. Sorry. For me as well,"" she said, wiping away tears.
Law experts quoted by Danish TV2 say the government went ahead with mass burial without getting an environmental impact assessment.
The opposition Liberal Party (Venstre) says the mink should be dug up and loaded into containers of manure, which would allegedly be a safer disposal method.
Environment Minister Lea Wermelin spoke to parliament - the Folketing - on Friday, in a crisis session called to deal with the mink problem.
She admitted that mass burial had not been the best method - incineration would have been preferable - but the spread of Covid-19 on mink farms had made the disposal urgent and there had been no other quick way to handle such a quantity of dead animals.
On Danish TV, the Liberals' environment spokesman Thomas Danielsen said ""this is a case full of errors and illegalities"".
A Socialist People's Party (SF) MP for West Jutland, Signe Munk, called the buried mink ""a ticking environmental bomb"" and said ""the mink must be removed"".
The head of the mink breeders' association, Tage Pedersen, said the cull spelt doom for Danish fur producers - a sector employing about 6,000 people and worth $800m (Â£600m) annually in exported pelts, Reuters news agency reported.
Denmark has about 1,100 mink farms - and so far no compensation deal has been decided."
"It was day two of our 18 day trek to Everest’s Base Camp when in the afternoon our head guide Lhakpa Nurbu Sherpa sombrely reported to me that 16 Sherpas had been killed in an avalanche on the mountain. I was leading a group of university students as part of a course I teach in human-nature interactions in high alpine environments. The news confirmed what I had been suspecting since earlier in the day as a result of the unusual flurry of helicopters around the mountains. While death and despair are common in the Everest region, this accident was especially tragic, as it is the largest number of lives ever to be claimed in one go on the mountain.  One of my students and I had been researching mountaineering deaths in the region, and had wondered how do locals and tourists view the grave sites along the route to Base Camp. But it never occurred to us that we would see the events unfold up close and personal, and that our research would take a different turn. So, during the next 16 days of trekking, I started talking to local Sherpas about various lifestyles and livelihoods on Everest that put human lives at imminent risk. I started wondering how humanity would respond to the news from this faraway land. My first reaction was not so much about those who died but was about those the dead ones left behind – a fatherless child, a young widow, a god-fearing father, a grieving mother.  The other reaction I had was how news gets distorted in the media. CNN reported Sherpas revolting on Everest, a completely fictitious account of the very real events that were unfolding in front of our own eyes. There was also the pathetic initial response of the Nepalese government that it would provide compensation of just 40,000 Nepali Rupees (less than US$500) to each of the victims’ families. Could all this have been avoided? Those who died were ferrying supplies between the two camps and the routes were becoming increasingly crowded so the porters had to slow down and got caught in the avalanche. The scientist in me wanted to blame the unstable snow conditions – snow accumulation during last winter on Everest slopes were considered above normal – or the crowd of climbers that had gathered at the base of that unforgiving mountain. Still others, and this included many local Sherpas, thought the high altitude porters brought this upon themselves. Sherpas talked about how high altitude Sherpa porters are exploited by Western and local climbing companies.  A consistent theme in local interpretations for why this took place is that climbing Everest is no longer authentic. It’s become something people want to tick off their life’s “bucket list” – an endeavour of ego enhancement and greed of mostly Western climbers who often ignore basic rules of mountaineering safety for themselves and their support team. Despite being crucial to the operation, Sherpa porters are on the lowest rung of mountaineers’ hierarchy, are often paid a pitiful salary (relative to the risk of dying), do not have adequate insurance coverage, and are treated by their own government with indifference. And there is the spiritual side of explanation to these events. Our own guide Lhakpa and some of the Sherpa lodge owners whom I talked to thought that the young porters today are oblivious to the spiritual connections that elder Sherpas have had with the mountains – and the respect which accompanies it. Indeed, the Everest region is dotted with sacred mountains, landscapes, Buddhist monasteries, religious objects and spiritual symbols.  The younger generation of Sherpas are less concerned with the spiritual side of the mountain. The younger generation Sherpas (some of those who died were barely out of their teen years) are lured by “easy” money hoping to make a quick go at the mountain to never return to face its wrath next year. They are lured again once the money runs out, and the cycle continues.  The 17 of us were reminded again of the deadly impact the mountain can have. In Chukung, below the slopes of Mt. Lhotse, we witnessed the frantic search for a trekker from Slovakia who had vanished during his excursion to a nearby glacier (as of May 3 – the last day of our trek in the region – he was still missing). Or, the trekker from India who had died two days earlier in the lodge next to ours in Tengboche, waiting for a helicopter to rescue him as he had succumbed to acute mountain sickness. Similarly, a Chinese trekker had to be airlifted from Everest Base Camp, as he too experienced the same malady. How many more deaths should the local community endure till they spring into action? The saga of death and despair on Mount Everest unfolds anew and seems to reach new proportions every year, as more and more people flock to the mountain. It’s time stricter limits were introduced to the mountain and safety of those conducting expeditions put above all else. The Nepalese government, international climbers and guides, and the local Sherpas must work together to develop sound policies and action plans to address issues of risk, safety, adequate life insurance and financial compensation. Above all, they must ensure that the mountains are treated with respect and fear. First things first, they should limit the number of climbing permits and make the mountain less accessible – not the other way around. Only by making the Everest climbing experience exclusive and targeted to climbing professionals, who’ve shown the mettle required to scale this deadly summit, can safety be improved and tragedies prevented."

Meteorologist Dr. Karsten Brandt. (Photo source: donnerwetter.de)
Phoenix invited meteorologist Dr. Karsten Brandt as an expert. Brandt is co-managing director of donnerwetter.de. He was asked by the Phoenix news achorman if we should expect more and bigger storms due to global warming.
I haven’t yet been able to find a clip of that particluar segment, so I have to rely on my memory for his answer.
When asked about the global warming-storm link, Brandt said that by looking back at the global data available over the last decades, there’s “no indication or evidence showing there’s been an increase in storm activity. The data don’t show it.” He added: “Luckily we don’t need to worry much about increasing storms in the future”.
No surprise here. This morning I see at Climate Depot that a number of other experts are also claiming there is no detectable link. But don’t take our word for it. Look at the data yourself:

"The UN climate talks due to be held in Glasgow later this year have been postponed as governments around the world struggle to halt the spread of coronavirus. The most important climate negotiations since the Paris agreement in 2015 were scheduled to take place this November to put countries back on track to avoid climate breakdown. They will now be pushed back to 2021. A statement from the UN on Wednesday night confirmed that the meeting of over 26,000 attendees would be delayed until next year. It said new dates for the conference would be decided in due course. The UK energy minister and president of the Cop26 conference, Alok Sharma, held crunch talks with the UN and several other countries on Wednesday evening to confirm the timing of the summit. “The world is currently facing an unprecedented global challenge and countries are rightly focusing their efforts on saving lives and fighting Covid-19. That is why we have decided to reschedule Cop26,” he said. “We will continue working tirelessly with our partners to deliver the ambition needed to tackle the climate crisis and I look forward to agreeing a new date for the conference.” The Cop26 meeting was scheduled to be held in Glasgow at the SEC arena, a venue that the Scottish government plans to turn into a field hospital to treat virus victims. The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change agreed to delay the vital talks because of the widespread disruption caused by coronavirus, and will also delay a key preliminary meeting scheduled for Bonn, Germany, which was also expected to be derailed by widespread lockdowns and travel restrictions. John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, said it was vital that the delay should not allow governments to back down on their commitments to tackle the climate crisis. “The decision to postpone the climate talks in Glasgow was inevitable given the health emergency the world is currently facing,” he told the Guardian. “But while the summit has been delayed, the climate emergency can’t be put on hold. Government stimulus packages will hold the key as to whether this emergency significantly delays or advances progress on tackling the climate emergency.” Some campaigners believe there could be another advantage to delay, as the US presidential elections take place this November, just before Cop26 was scheduled to begin. With the summit delayed to next year, other governments will have time to adjust either to a second term of Donald Trump – who opposes the Paris agreement and is withdrawing the US from it – or a new president who is likely to support climate action. But several prominent climate experts had feared that delaying the talks would mean governments eased off on pursuing stronger commitments to fulfil the Paris goals. Christiana Figueres, the UN climate chief who oversaw the Paris summit in 2015, had argued for keeping Glasgow on track. On Wednesday night she accepted the delay but added: “Emissions must peak this year if we want to limit warming to 1.5C and the Paris agreement set the Cop26 summit as the moment when all countries would ramp up their targets in line with the steep emissions decline we need to see in this decisive next decade.” The Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC) welcomed the delay as the best hope of rebuilding diplomatic momentum before the talks take place. Stephanie Pfeifer, the group’s CEO, said investors would support the decision because it “improves the likelihood of a strong outcome and ensuring that the world is put on a path to tackle the climate crisis”. But the delay will come as a blow to some climate campaigners, who have urged the UK government to proceed with the conference despite the outbreak to avoid stalling progress on global climate action. They believe since the Paris agreement, countries have failed to develop climate commitments that go far enough to avoid a catastrophic environmental breakdown. The Glasgow talks aim to galvanise tougher plans to cap rising temperatures by limiting greenhouse gas emissions."
"Parts of the UK had more than a month’s rain in one day on Monday June 10. More rain on the following Tuesday, particularly in the north of England and Midlands, created localised flooding. Sinkholes appearing on the M25 – one of Europe’s busiest motorways – and closed train lines have created expensive travel chaos. The flooding of hospitals and other essential services has even put lives at risk. In the middle of all this, groundwater levels across the country are much lower than normal. There’s been little rain between 2018 and 2019 – the winter was drier than normal and it wasn’t so long ago that Britain was basking in one of the warmest Easter weekends on record. Still yellowing lawns suggest that hardly any rain has fallen since. This isn’t an usual pattern of weather and it isn’t specifically linked to climate change. Slow-moving, intense bands of rainfall can emerge in the summer, though wetter Junes can possibly be linked to climate change as the jet stream – which is responsible for steering much of the weather systems we get over Britain – changes due to a warming atmosphere. You might expect the dry ground to soak up all the water, but it hasn’t for several reasons. The rainfall has been so intense that the ground can’t soak it up fast enough. So many of the surfaces in urban areas of the UK are paved over and don’t allow water to soak through naturally, causing huge amounts of run-off. Smaller rivers respond very quickly to heavy rainfall, which is why we have seen many smaller rivers and tributaries bursting their banks and causing localised flooding. Many of the flood warnings in place in the north of England and Midlands are for tributaries and smaller rivers with names that many people have never heard of before, but these often flow through urban areas and close to homes and businesses. Whatever the river is called, it’s not much fun when it’s flowing through your kitchen. The bigger rivers on the other hand, such as the Thames and Severn take much longer to respond to heavy rain and will only flood when water tables are much higher than they are at present. Lower groundwater levels mean that larger rivers are able to swallow up extra water without too much trouble. If rain keeps up for another month or two, we could be in trouble. This is what happened during the winter of 2013-14, when months of rain meant the Thames flooded towns like Oxford, Staines and Wraysbury, and low-lying parts of Somerset resembled a lake. What does this mean? It’s a reminder that floods are pretty simple – lots of rain very often equals flooding, no matter what has happened with the weather in previous weeks and months. It also shows that floods are made worse by the way people have changed the landscape – paving over areas so that water runs off the ground too quickly, creating floods that are essentially human-made. Floods are only a problem when people are in the way of them. Britain needs to build more homes, but where and how many will affect the risk of more floods in future. There are still plans to build homes on floodplains, which we should avoid. The construction of sustainable drainage systems – ditches and ponds that hold back water where it falls and prevent heavy rain from rushing into rivers too quickly – hasn’t gone far enough. Dealing with flooding is a team effort – it requires collaboration between flood authorities, landowners, homeowners, community groups, and local and national government. Only by working together can effective action be taken. People very often have good local knowledge about flooding. They know when and where it will flood, and can sometimes be perplexed when “experts” tell them otherwise. Much of the political fallout during the 2013-14 flooding was not due to the damage itself, but anger from communities who felt abandoned or ignored. As the UK commits to limit future climate change by setting emissions targets, people must consider the costs of the climate change people are already experiencing. This means changing how we live our lives, not just to prevent future floods but to deal with floods when they next occur. We must prepare better for floods, not just for the next decade, but for those next week. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter. Climate change is inevitable. Our response to it isn’t."

Share this...FacebookTwitterAnd a project that involves the such can only be called one thing: really dumb. Before other countries dive into renewable energies, drunk on green fantasies, they should take a look at what is happening in Germany. Indeed, sobriety helps.
The online Die Welt had a piece on the spiraling electricity costs in Germany a couple of weeks ago.

Germany’s “moon-landing” energy project risks crash-landing on Earth. Photo credit: Andrew Marino at en.wikipedia.
Transforming the energy supply system to one that will be based on 80% renewable energy by 2050 is considered Germany’s moon-landing project. Unfortunately it risks crash-landing right here on Earth.
Skyrocketing costs and growing supply uncertainties are putting the German government under massive pressure. The project has been riddled by a complete lack of planning and management. The reason for that of course is because real planning involves honest analysis, which reveals what is feasible and what isn’t. The proponents of green energy simply did not want the answer to that question. So they skipped the planning altogether and dove into it blindly.
Today intermittent wind and sun are causing Germany’s power grid to fluctuate so wildly that the government is now forced to implement drastic measures. For example, industry will be compensated for damages, at the consumers’ expense, when they have to shut down their operations to in order to prevent a grid collapse (of the sort we saw in Munich some weeks ago).
Die Welt writes that chemical, aluminum and steel plants consuming massive amounts of energy will have to shut down or scale back during periods when the power supply is lacking. For the ‘capacity that can be shut down’ “experts have recommended the appropriate compensation of 2000 euros per megawatt and year. But industry will receive 20,000 euros/MW for shutting down. (…] ten times the amount. Thanks to a government that will make the consumers pay anything to keep the scam going.

While the politicians keep passing all the high costs to consumers, they turn around and have the gall to publicly insist that electricity has to remain affordable in Germany.
According to Die Welt, consumers will also be liable for the costs of offshore windparks in the event of construction delays or inabilities by the grid to absorb the power they produce. The result, writes Die Welt: “The price of electricity, now the second-highest in Europe, will continue to rise.” Germany’s attraction for business investment is losing its luster.
Even green energy producers see costs going out of control
The providers of green energy are waking up to the reality. Die Welt writes:

Also the Association of New Energy Providers (BNE), who actively promoted the end of nuclear energy and the switch to renewables, is sobering up. ‘Instead of constantly coming up with new fees, charges, subsidies, exemptions and other market-foreign cash flows, the German government must now boldly plan the switchover to the system,’ demands BNEChief Robert Busch: ‘Otherwise we are going to lose the battle against the costs and the energy transformation will drown in a sea of subsidies.'”

Die Welt predicts more continuing rapid cost increases for consumers, thanks to the Energieeinsparverordnung (EneV), which will go into effect in 2014 and mandates tough thermal insulation standards for buildings. “Rental costs will be driven higher and higher,” warns Axel Gedaschko, President of the Federal Association of German Apartment Companies (GdW). “Already now in large cities there’s a massive problem of offering affordable living space for low-income families.”
Little wonder 600,000 households have seen their power get cut off. The green revolution is producing social injustice that is casting the poorest out in the cold.

From the Heartland Institute, they call out the Center for American Progress for posting falsehoods, but invite them to the conference anyway. Class act.

Liberal Think Tank’s ‘Prebuttal’ Gets Facts Wrong About The Heartland Institute, Climate Conference
Today at 2 p.m. EDT — a day before The Heartland Institute opens its Sixth International Conference on Climate Change, (ICCC-6) — the Center for American Progress will host a conference call to offer what amounts to a “prebuttal” to Heartland’s event.
The following comments by Jim Lakely, director of communications for The Heartland Institute, may be used for attribution. For additional comments, email Jim Lakely at jlakely@heartland.org or call 312/377-4000. For information on Heartland’s climate conference — held June 30 and July 1 at the Marriott Wardman Park in Washington, DC — visit the conference Web page. To register for media credentials for the conference, click here.

“This is ‘progress,’ all right — for The Heartland Institute,” Lakely said. “For years, the global warming alarmists thought the best counter-strategy to The Heartland Institute’s climate conferences was to ignore them. No matter how many scientists we brought in to talk about what the observational and historical data say about the climate, the enviro-left’s strategy never wavered — until now. This is proof Heartland’s years-long effort to help restore the scientific method to the debate is cutting through the fog of politics and panic.
“I want to take this opportunity to invite staffers from the Center for American Progress to ICCC-6, as well as the folks who will be countering Heartland’s conference on their press call,” Lakely said. “There’s time allotted for Q&A after every presentation, and the scientists in attendance will gladly field their questions.”
(You can watch Heartland’s climate conference live starting at
8:30 a.m. Thursday, June 30 and Friday, July 1.)
Lakely adds it is a “myth” that only skeptics are invited to Heartland climate conferences.
“We always invite the ‘other side,’ but few accept the challenge,” Lakely said.
One scholar who accepted the challenge, atmospheric scientist Scott Denning of Colorado State University, made a point to mention how well he and his views were received at ICCC-4 in Chicago last year and urged his colleagues to join him. Heartland’s YouTube page has a four-minute clip of Denning’s remarks here. Some excerpts:
“I learned a lot here. … I actually feel that it’s really too bad that more of my colleagues from the scientific community didn’t attend this, and haven’t in the past. And I hope we can remedy that in the future. … We can learn quite a bit from each other. … I think the most important thing that we have in common is the following: that we think we need public policy that is based on facts, rather than facts that are based on a policy agenda.”
The Center for American Progress press release has another error of fact. The organization’s Christina DiPasquale writes: “The Heartland Institute, a conservative group funded by Exxon Mobil and Charles Koch …”
“This is a common and inaccurate charge of the left when mentioning The Heartland Institute,” Lakely said. “ExxonMobil has not contributed to Heartland since 2006 — and even then, the company’s gifts were modest. In addition, the Kochs have not sent money Heartland’s way for more than a decade. And neither ‘bogeyman’ of the left is funding this conference, nor has funded any of Heartland’s past conferences. None of the organizations Heartland listed as cosponsors contribute toward the cost of these events, either.”
More information on The Heartland Institute’s funding can be found here.

Writing as background for their work, the six‐​member research team of Koweek _et al_. (2015) cite several concerns about the future of Earth’s corals that have been projected to result from the so‐​called _twin evils_ of global warming and ocean acidification, including “coral bleaching (Glynn, 1993; Hughes _et al_., 2003; van Hooidonk _et al_., 2013), increased dissolution and bioerosion (Andersson and Gledhill, 2013; Dove _et al_., 2013; Reyes‐​Nivia _et al_., 2013), decreased biodiversity (Fabricius _et al_., 2011), and shifts toward algal‐​dominated reefs (Hoegh‐​Guldberg _et al_., 2007; Kroeker _et al_., 2010; 2013).” However, despite these concerns, which have captured the attention of scientists and policy makers for more than two decades now, such worries may well be overestimated and overplayed.   
  
  
The reason for such growing optimism has to do with the corals themselves, which along with other marine organisms appear to have an inherent ability “of controlling their own biogeochemical environments.” Such _biologically‐​mediated_ controls, if they are of sufficient magnitude, could potentially offset future changes in the marine environment brought about by rising atmospheric CO2 (projected ocean warming and pH decline). It is therefore of considerable importance for scientists to continue investigating these biological feedbacks in order to better ascertain the future of these precious marine species, for as noted by Koweek _et al_., “the paradigm of coral reefs as passive responders to their biogeochemical environments is rapidly changing.”   
  
  
In further expanding the scientific knowledge on this important topic, the six American researchers set out to conduct a “short, high‐​resolution physical and biogeochemical pilot field study” on the back reefs of Ofu, American Samoa, where they measured a number of hydrodynamic and biogeochemical parameters there over a seven‐​day period in November, 2011. The specific study location was Pool 100 (14.185°S, 169.666°W), a shallow lagoon containing 85 coral species and various kinds of crustose coralline algae and non‐​calcifying algae. Koweek _et al_. selected Pool 100 because, as they state, shallow back reefs “commonly experience greater thermal and biogeochemical variability owing to a combination of coral community metabolism, environmental forcing, flow regime, and water depth.”   
  
  
Results of their data collection and analysis revealed that temperatures within the shallow back reef environment were consistently 2–3°C warmer during the day than that observed in the offshore environment. In addition, and as expected, the ranges of the physical and biogeochemical parameters studied in Pool 100 greatly exceeded the variability observed in the open ocean. Inside Pool 100, the pH values fluctuated between a low of 7.80 and a high of 8.39 across the seven days of study, with daily ranges spanning between 0.5 and 0.6 of a unit (Figure 1). What is more, Koweek _et al_. report that the reef community in Pool 100 spent far more time _outside_ of the offshore pH range than within it (pH values were between 8.0 and 8.2 during only 30 percent of the observational period, less than 8.0 for 34 percent of the time and greater than 8.2 for the remaining 36 percent of the observations). Additional measurements and calculations indicated that these fluctuations in pH were largely the product of community primary production and respiration, as well as tidal modulation and wave‐​driven flow.

Vertical blue and orange lines show the occurrence of high and low tides, respectively. Gray vertical shading shows the period from sundown to sunrise.

The different colored circles represent data that were collected from different locations in Pool 100 and the dashed horizontal black lines represent the mean value of each parameter in the offshore ocean. Adapted from Koweek et al. (2015)._



Commenting on these and other of their findings, Koweek _et al_. write that “our measurements have provided insight into the physical–biogeochemical coupling on Ofu.” And that insight, they add, “suggests a significantly more nuanced view of the fate of coral reefs” than the demise of global reef systems that is traditionally forecast under the combined stresses of climate change and ocean acidification.   
  
  
Indeed, if these ecosystems presently _thrive_ under such variable (and more severe) environmental conditions than those predicted for the future—which conditions are largely derived and modulated by themselves—why wouldn’t they persist?

Our favourite ‘science’ reporter is out on the bandwagon again, telling us that a climate scientist says global warming is making the rainfalls in New Zealand more intense.



Scientists have confirmed what many people in rain-soaked regions have long suspected: climate change has been driving a widespread rise in big deluges.



And they expect the patterns that have been pieced together in a just-published study to only intensify as the world warms.



Big rainfall events are one of the most damaging consequences of climate change, packing the potential to damage homes and trigger landslides and flash floods. […]



Over the past five decades, this has shown no clear evidence that intense events had changed since 1960, besides some drops and increases at certain places.



But, when looking at the picture a different way – recording all of the rain that fell across an extreme event, rather than just a day of it – the trends appeared much more dramatic.



Climate scientist Professor Jim Salinger found that, between [sic] **between 1961 and 2010** , annual extreme rainfall when measured by event had increased noticeably in the west and south of the South Island – and had fallen in the drier north and east of both islands.



When compared with the one-day measure, the “extreme event annual maximum” ranged from 25 per cent higher in the east, to 60 per cent higher in the west and south of the South Island.



Salinger said climate change would boost the intensity of these events even more.



With each degree of warming, he estimated the event annual maximum climbed by 5 per cent in the west of the South Island, and north-west of the North Island.



“Essentially with warming, heavy precipitation maximum annual events get wetter.” […]





Yadda, yadda, yadda.



My very first thought was, “ **Why stop the data at 2010** , why ignore the most recent data which is likely to be more accurate than measurements back in the 60s?”



So I went looking. I found the NIWA NZ [Seven Station Series](https://www.niwa.co.nz/our-science/climate/information-and-resources/nz-temp-record/seven-station-series-temperature-data) temperature data and graphed that. Then I found the [NZ Historic Weather Events Catalog](https://hwe.niwa.co.nz/) and selected ‘Heavy Rain’ from 1961 to 2018. I counted the number of events recorded per year and added that to the graph.



It then seemed to become apparent why our climate scientist stopped his data in 2010. Admittedly the climate chappie will have access to much more data than I found in an afternoon but the question remains: why cut off at 2010?



You will see a little formula in that graph, which is the trend line for temperature rise over that period: 0.13 C per decade or 1.3 C per century. And that massive rise is based on ‘adjusted’ data.



Jamie, if you are going to be a science reporter, how about asking a question or two?

When it comes to climate science and energy policy, a similar absurdity is taking place, i.e. the environmentalists are taking over energy policy-making. Canadian investigative journalist Donna Laframboise has uncovered it, and FOX NEWS here has the report: “Leaked UN climate report slammed for citing WWF, Greenpeace“.
Fox writes:
Critics are blasting a draft U.N. climate change report that combines studies by advocacy groups like the World Wildlife Fund and Greenpeace alongside scientific research papers — the same issue that led independent auditors to slam the U.N.’s last report.
‘You’d think that the IPCC would have learned its lesson, that it would have told its authors not to rely on these sorts of publications,’ said Donna Laframboise, the head of nofrakkingconsensus.com, an investigative website skeptical of the scientific consensus on global warming.
‘The report currently includes, amongst its list of references, nine separate publications produced wholly or in part by the WWF,’ Laframboise told FoxNews.com. ‘The report currently includes nine separate publications produced wholly or in part by the WWF.'”

So nothing has changed at the IPCC. In it’s 2007 report, advocacy and activists groups were cited throughout. The science isn’t convincing enough and so the IPCC is resorting to scientifically unfounded exaggerations from advocacy groups who are pushing a sole agenda. FOX NEWS quotes John Christy, climatologist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville:
“In general, I don’t think reports by advocacy groups are credible.”
Laframboise adds.
The real issue is that all of the evidence is being evaluated either by people who embrace an activist worldview, or who don’t consider an activist worldview to be at odds with rigorous science. […] The IPCC sees nothing wrong with activist perspectives. That’s what gives the game away. That’s what tells us that what’s going on at the IPCC is not science.”

Karim, not his real name, was a doctor working in a hospital in Iraq in 2019 when a group of militiamen entered with a dying patient on a trolley.
They demanded to see a doctor and Karim claims he was with the patient in moments, doing his best to save his life, but the man died and the militia blamed Karim.
Karim says he was not the first doctor to be targeted - and it was what happened to the others that meant he had to flee.
""I think my fate will be death, because this is what had happened to one of our consultants in the hospital a few months before I fled the country.
""They followed him for about six months and then they shot him over the whole of his body. I had no choice but to flee,"" he told the BBC.
Karim says another consultant was told by a militia member that he would be killed if he did not pay them $20,000 after he had treated a pregnant mother whose child was born with a congenital abnormality.
Karim and his wife, who is also a doctor, flew to the UK last November, claiming asylum when they arrived.
Just over a year later, their application has no end in sight.
""We don't have any exact date which tells us that at least we will be interviewed or we will have a decision by this time, nothing like this,"" says Karim.
""Me and my wife tried our best by contacting the Home Office to get an exemption to support the NHS as doctors during this pandemic, and all our efforts were refused.
""I also offered to volunteer as a doctor but the NHS will not allow you to do any work inside their hospitals if you don't have permission to work.""
As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Home Office cancelled asylum interviews on 19 March.
Guidance published on 6 August stated there would be a phased resumption of interviews using video conferencing.
Some face-to-face interviews have now resumed.
However, figures published this week show a rise in the number of asylum seekers waiting for more than six months for their case to be determined.
They show:
That represents a rise of more than 16,000 people.
""More than 36,000 asylum seekers, many of whom are traumatised and vulnerable, have waited longer than six months for a Home Office decision that is pivotal for their future, their family and their security. This is unacceptable,"" Law Society President David Greene told the BBC.
""Asylum seekers are living in limbo, unable to earn a living, contribute to the economy or, as in Karim's case, support the NHS.
""We need an immigration and asylum system that treats people fairly, that is efficient and provides timely, lawful decisions.
""Justice delayed is justice denied.""
Anyone wishing to stay in the UK as a refugee must apply for asylum.
To be eligible you must have left your country and be unable to go back because you fear persecution.
Applications should be made on arrival in the UK or as soon as it is thought it would be unsafe to return to your own country.
After you apply, you will have a meeting with an immigration officer, a process known as screening.
There will then be an asylum interview with a caseworker which will determine your asylum status. If successful you may be given permission to stay in the UK for five years. This is known as ""leave to remain"".
In May 2019 the government scrapped its target of processing most asylum claims within six months but said it was committed to ensuring claims were considered without unnecessary delay ""to ensure individuals who need protection are granted asylum as soon as possible and can start to integrate and rebuild their lives, including those granted at appeal"".
Home Secretary Priti Patel told the BBC the need for change in the UK's asylum system had never been clearer.
""With over 48,000 asylum cases stuck in this broken system, I will bring forward new legislation next year to ensure vulnerable people get the support they need instead of being stuck in the system waiting for a decision and unable to get on with rebuilding their lives.
""This also means ending abuse of the asylum system. Our new legislation will introduce a new firm system to expedite removals of foreign criminals, stop people coming here illegally and instead prioritise those most in need who play by the rules."""

If governments continue to pile on more and more debt, when will they reach the tipping point? The Greeks appear to be close to the tipping point, and it is only a matter of time before other European countries, and eventually even the United States, begin their fiscal death spiral. 



The Greek government’s unwillingness to make the hard choices necessary to put its fiscal house in order in the past few weeks has caused investors to demand a 2.5 percent premium on its government‐​issued Eurobonds over those issued by the German government. 



First, a little background. Eurozone governments have a contractual obligation not to incur annual deficits of more than 3 percent, yet the deficit forecast for 2010 for all major Eurozone economies is far in excess of that number. Greece (12.2 percent), Ireland (14.7 percent) and the U.K. (at 12.9 percent) are even in double digits. As can be seen in the accompanying table, the average Eurozone deficit is projected to be 6.9 percent, more than double the agreed‐​upon limit. 



Greece has reached a crisis stage and, as noted, its debt is now selling at a deep discount compared to other EU countries. Ireland has a bigger deficit, but its total net government debt is only 38 percent, as contrasted with Greece’s 95 percent. But the Irish, unlike the Greeks, are instituting a credible plan to cut government spending and get their economy back on the growth track. 



The fundamental problem with most of the world’s largest economies is that they have allowed government spending to grow faster than economic growth, which can only lead to long‐​run economic disaster. 



Many governments are proposing tax increases, but they cannot tax their way out of this problem because most of their tax rates are already above their long‐​run revenue‐​maximizing rate. 



Further tax increases will only result in even slower economic growth and an increase in the underground economy, making the fiscal situation worse rather than better. The responsible choice is a radical cut in government spending growth, with the alternative being economic stagnation or worse, likely coupled with a high rate of inflation. 



Japan has tried to spend itself into prosperity by issuing more and more debt. Up until now, it has avoided inflation but has suffered a decade of economic stagnation, with a falling share of world gross domestic product, and the situation can only get worse. 



The Obama administration and the Congress are in a headlong rush to push the country over the fiscal tipping point. The fiscal tipping point is the point where the interest that premium bond buyers are demanding to compensate them for the risk of default and/​or accelerating inflation causes the total interest cost to be so high that the government is borrowing just to pay the interest. This is equivalent to a family being so far in debt that it is borrowing just to pay the interest on its mortgage, credit cards, etc. 



The proposed health care plan and the environmental cap‐​and‐​trade scheme will add trillions of dollars to the U.S. debt over the next few years and, in all likelihood, soon will drive the total debt burden to well over 100 percent of GDP. Even if the administration were to tax the “rich” at 100 percent of their incomes, there would still not be enough money to pay for all of these spending schemes. 



The following should be known to most members of Congress. The size of the U.S. government is already well over the welfare and economic growth‐​maximizing rate. Taxes on upper‐​income Americans are well above the revenue‐​maximizing rate. Thus, for those in the political class to further increase the size of government and government debt as a percentage of GDP is grossly irresponsible. It is almost as if they had a death wish for the country. 



Humans are quite good at adapting to climate change. Our species has already lived through hundreds of climate cycles. What they are not good at is adapting to the fiscal and monetary falsehoods of politicians. Yet, the politicians would prefer to fly around the world talking about climate change rather than putting their fiscal house in order. 



Bond buyers are not stupid. They can see what is happening. If the administration and Congress do not soon reverse course, the cost of servicing the debt will quickly drive the U.S. to the fiscal tipping point. 



Once the tipping point is reached, government will shrink one way or another, because there will be no way to fund the previous bloated state. Who will be most hurt? Those most dependent on government.

There’s a lovely 2005 paper I hadn’t seen, put out by the Los Alamos National Laboratory entitled “Our Calibrated Model has No Predictive Value” (PDF).
Figure 1. The Tinkertoy Computer. It also has no predictive value.
The paper’s abstract says it much better than I could:
Abstract: It is often assumed that once a model has been calibrated to measurements then it will have some level of predictive capability, although this may be limited. If the model does not have predictive capability then the assumption is that the model needs to be improved in some way.
Using an example from the petroleum industry, we show that cases can exist where calibrated models have no predictive capability. This occurs even when there is no modelling error present. It is also shown that the introduction of a small modelling error can make it impossible to obtain any models with useful predictive capability.
We have been unable to find ways of identifying which calibrated models will have some predictive capacity and those which will not.
There are three results in there, one expected and two unexpected.

The expected result is that models that are “tuned” or “calibrated” to an existing dataset may very well have no predictive capability. On the face of it this is obvious—if we could tune a model that simply then someone would be predicting the stock market or next month’s weather with good accuracy.
The next result was totally unexpected. The model may have no predictive capability despite being a perfect model. The model may represent the physics of the situation perfectly and exactly in each and every relevant detail. But if that perfect  model is tuned to a dataset, even a perfect dataset, it may have no predictive capability at all.
The third unexpected result was the effect of error. The authors found that if there are even small modeling errors, it may not be possible to find any model with useful predictive capability.
To paraphrase, even if a tuned (“calibrated”) model is perfect about the physics, it may not have predictive capabilities. And if there is even a little error in the model, good luck finding anything useful.
This was a very clean experiment. There were only three tunable parameters. So it looks like John Von Neumann was right, you can fit an elephant with three parameters, and with four parameters, make him wiggle his trunk.
I leave it to the reader to consider what this means about the various climate models’ ability to simulate the future evolution of the climate, as they definitely are tuned or as the study authors call them “calibrated” models, and they definitely have more than three tunable parameters.
In this regard, a modest proposal. Could climate scientists please just stop predicting stuff for maybe say one year? In no other field of scientific endeavor is every finding surrounded by predictions that this “could” or “might” or “possibly” or “perhaps” will lead to something catastrophic in ten or thirty or a hundred years. Could I ask that for one short year, that climate scientists actually study the various climate phenomena, rather than try to forecast their future changes? We still are a long ways from understanding the climate, so could we just study the present and past climate, and leave the future alone for one year?
We have no practical reason to believe that the current crop of climate models have predictive capability. For example, none of them predicted the current 15-year or so hiatus in the warming. And as this paper shows, there is certainly no theoretical reason to think they have predictive capability.
The models, including climate models, can sometimes illustrate or provide useful information about climate. Could we use them for that for a while? Could we use them to try to understand the climate, rather than to predict the climate?
And 100 and 500 year forecasts? I don’t care if you do call them “scenarios” or whatever the current politically correct term is. Predicting anything 500 years out is a joke. Those, you could stop forever with no loss at all
I would think that after the unbroken string of totally incorrect prognostications from Paul Ehrlich and John Holdren and James Hansen and other failed serial doomcasters, the alarmists would welcome such a hiatus from having to dream up the newer, better future catastrophe. I mean, it must get tiring for them, seeing their predictions of Thermageddon™ blown out of the water by ugly reality, time after time, without interruption. I think they’d welcome a year where they could forget about tomorrow.
Regards to all,
w.

The new ‘evil’ is jet contrails. They are going to cook us all. Much worse than CO2 etc etc yadda yadda



The aviation industry is even worse for climate change than previously thought, with a new study revealing the damage being done by otherwise harmless contrails.



 **They’re so bad, German researchers say, they’re responsible for more warming than all aviation carbon emissions ever made** – from the day the Wright brothers flew their first plane until now.



“Lots of people talk about the need to stop air traffic increasing all the time, but this is not taken that seriously,” co-author Ulrike Burkhardt told New Scientist.



Aviation accounts for about 5 percent of the world’s carbon emissions. Contrails – a mix of water vapour and impurities from the plane’s engine left behind in the cool upper atmosphere – **contribute to warming by trapping in more heat than they reflect back into space, a process known as radiative forcing.**



The researchers **modelled** the effect contrails would have up until the year 2050, when the skies are expected to be four times busier than they are already. While cleaner fuels will help keep aviation’s impact on temperatures in check, the sheer amount of cloud cover formed by contrails will wipe out any gains. […]



Modelled …. oh right … we can stop reading right there.



Because …



After 9/11 airplanes were grounded for three days so some scientists investigated what effect the lack of contrails had on temperatures. The temperature went up **without** contrails.



About a year after the attacks, Andrew Carleton, David Travis, a geographer at the University of Wisconsin, and another colleague argued in a paper that thin clouds created by contrails reduce the range of temperatures. By contributing to cloud cover during the day, they reflect solar energy that would otherwise have reached the earth’s surface. At night, they trap warmth that would otherwise have escaped.



The effect during the three days that flights were grounded was strongest in populated regions where air traffic was normally densest. **The increase in range came to about two degrees Celsius.**



Other studies have tended to back up the research. In 2011, British scientists wrote that an air raid in May 1944 involving over 1,400 aircraft measurably lowered daytime temperatures in England. In that case, the situation was the reverse of 9/11 – large-scale air travel was unknown, and dense concentrations of large planes were rare. […]



But the models predict doom so, let’s print that.

"**Loneliness among parents of young children has ""dramatically increased"" during the pandemic, suggests research from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's Royal Foundation.**
The charity gathered views from half a million people in the UK on bringing up children under the age of five.
It found parents increasingly worried about feeling cut off from support, particularly in more deprived areas.
The duchess said it had been a ""hugely challenging"" year for families.
""It's very tough,"" says Emily Wingrove, mother of three-year-old Franklin and Denis who had his first birthday this month, in celebrations muted by the lockdown.
She lives with her two young children in a small flat in south London and has been cut off from her own family and in-laws.
""It's draining. It takes its toll. There's definitely a burn out, like hitting a brick wall. When is it going to end?""
Emily misses the ""reassurance"" of being able to talk to other mothers and worries about the lack of access to children's centres and baby clinics.
The pressure on parents is relentless, she says, with ""no night off to recharge the batteries"".
Families without a garden have had a much tougher time than has been recognised, she says.
""It's so difficult to keep them entertained. Every second is a battle,"" she says.
The report from the Royal Foundation shows parents under emotional pressure in the pandemic - drawing on 528,000 responses to the Five Big Questions survey launched by the duchess, plus further research with 3,700 people across the UK.
It is claimed to be one of the biggest ever responses to such a survey into childhood - and the duchess says problems in adult life, such as ""homelessness, addiction, and poor mental health are often grounded in a difficult childhood"".
Addressing an online forum on Friday, the duchess said support for children in early years should have equal status to ""the other great social challenges"".
""The early years are not simply about how we raise our children. They are in fact about how we raise the next generation of adults. They are about the society we will become,"" said the duchess.
A greater investment in children's first years ""isn't for the quick win - it is for the big win,"" the duchess told her online audience.
The research shows separation from family, friends and support networks during the lockdown taking a heavy psychological toll on parents of young children - with 63% reporting feelings of loneliness, compared with 38% before the pandemic.
But the Duchess of Cambridge warns her research also shows ""just one in four recognise the specific importance of the first five years of a child's life"".
""I can't describe the loneliness. Everything is on you,"" says Rebecca Goatley, a lone parent, living in Wallingford, Oxfordshire, with her three year old son.
Making it even more of a ""complete nightmare"", she had coronavirus during the lockdown.
""I've never been so unwell in my life. I thought I was getting a bit of a sore throat and then when I was cooking dinner I couldn't smell anything,"" she says.
It meant looking after her son in their flat while suffering from Covid, with her mother helping by dropping round food.
""I've never felt tiredness like it,"" says Rebecca, who usually enjoys playing rugby rather than being ""stuck in a flat with no one to talk to"".
The whole experience of the pandemic has been one of exhaustion for parents with young children, says Rebecca.
""Mentally and emotionally it's been really hard,"" she says, with parents isolated from their friends and family while children have also been desperate to play with their own friends.
""It's been so strange - and made me feel disconnected from everything,"" she says.
""There's not been enough focus on kids in the lockdown and how it has affected them. It was like cabin fever,"" says Rebecca.
The research launched by the Duchess of Cambridge says parents have neglected their own well-being, with only 10% taking time to think about their own mental health.
It also found 70% of parents ""felt judged"" about how they were bringing up their children, or how their children were behaving, and that could ""make a bad situation worse"".
Neil Leitch of the Early Years Alliance says ""the first five years of a child's life are absolutely critical for a child's long-term life chances"".
But during the pandemic, he says, the focus was too often on getting children back to school, rather than the support and childcare needed for families with young children.
""Parents put pressure on themselves,"" says Zunaira, who misses the friendships and social activities that would usually be a lifeline for this mother of two young children.
It is easy for parents to be guilt-tripped into thinking they should be coming up with amazing activities every day.
""It's lonely. You lose your own self, you forget about yourself - and all the focus is on another person.
""Your identity goes and I felt like I was suffocating,"" said Zunaira, from Peterborough.
The long, exhausting pandemic is taking its toll on young families, she says, cutting them off from the simplest pleasures.
""You just want to sit in a cafe, have a bit of cake and a talk,"" she says."

=================================================
Where’s the Climate Change?
By Dr. Karsten Brandt
www.donnerwetter.de/
Climate change – varying signals
Things are getting tense for the prophets of global warming, or better said: serious. This is because climate models are supposed to reproduce reality. For 25 years there have been “modern climate prognoses from ever more sophisticated calculations and every bigger computers”. In the meantime billions (and perhaps even a trillion) have been spent on climate science. The result: It’s going to get warmer quickly. By 2020 climate change will be especially detectable in the global temperature curve.
But the actual signals are in fact confusing. On one hand numerous temperature records are being broken at weather stations, and on the other hand various data are showing that the temperature trend has stagnated over the last 15 years.
A truly good explanation for this surprise does not exist. In 2007 Donnerwetter.de provided a number of contradictions surrounding the climate prognoses. For example, the danger of storms in Germany was supposed to increase, but nstead the danger of storms in Germany has been on the decline.
Here are our views on climate change from 2007, and they still hold today
After North Sea storm “Kyrill“ struck, one could read and hear everywhere that the weather has gone crazy and that climate change was causing more chaotic and dangerous weather in Germany. But repeating a claim over and over again does not make it correct. Donnerwetter.de Weather Services has therefore put many of the more popular claims to the test.
Fact: Climate is changing, the temperatures have been rising globally, and also in Germany this trend can be clearly seen. It’s also a fact that man has played a large role in this development and thus must continue making efforts to protect the environment. But it is also a fact that the horror scenarios produced for Germany are without any scientific merit:
Claim no. 1: Storms and cyclones are on the rise
———————————————————————-
The fact is that the number of storms and cyclones over the last few years have been very low from a historical standpoint. Around 1550 about 40 storms were observed each year; that number dropped to around 20 during the 18th century. In the 19th and 20th centuries the number ranged between 10 and 20. The last years have been really quiet. the number of storms dropped considerably, especially after 1995.
Thus claim no. 1 is false!
Claim no. 2: North Sea storm surges are on the rise
———————————————————————-
Statistics show that the number of storm surges at the German North Sea coast have dropped markedly. After a strong increase in storm surges during the 1940s, it can be observed that they are much less today.
That claim is false as well!
Claim no. 3: Climate change is causing more hurricanes
———————————————————————-
There are no statements concerning wind climate in the pertinent IPCC publications. In its own publication, re-insurer Munich Re determined that future development is very uncertain. But if the climate prognoses are correct, then westerlies should be weaker, and thus the probability of large storms even declines! Therefore it is incomprehensible how such claims could be made.

google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";
google_ad_width = 200;
google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




The claim is at the very least doubtful.
Claim no. 4; Bad weather (violent thunderstorms/tornadoes) are increasing in Germany
———————————————————————-
This is also a widespread belief. But it is not supported by any data. To the contrary: the number of days with storms and heavy rains has declined or remained constant at many weather stations since the mid 1990s. Especially in the summertime stormy winds occur only during thunderstorms. One example: in Aachen the number of storm days (wind strength more than 6) from 1990 to 2006 declined to only 2 days per month during this period (that’s 25% less!).
The claim is false!
Claim no. 5: Bad weather (violent thunderstorms/tornadoes) are increasing because of climate change
———————————————————————-
This is merely suspected in studies by climate scientists, but there is no proof. The data actually point to the contrary.
This claim is doubtful at best.
Claim no. 6: The weather is becoming more chaotic and the atmosphere is “more loaded with energy”
———————————————————————-
It’s claimed time and again that rising temperatures will lead to greater temperature differences, and therefore will mean higher energy and bad weather potential in the atmosphere. Indeed temperatures in the polar regions are rising faster than in the subtropical regions. But this would point to a decrease in temperature difference, and thus tend to quiet the atmosphere.
That claim is false!
Claim no. 7: The climate has become more variable. Temperatrure fluctuations are greater. You can no longer rely on anything.
———————————————————————-
In studying the temperature fluctuation range in Germany (standard deviation) since 1756, the exact opposite is true. In the 18th century the standard deviation for the annual mean temperature was 25% higher than today. It dropped steadily until 1920 to today’s level, and has been fluctuating at this level ever since. Thus the weather has not gotten more variable. It used to be much worse.
The claim is false!
—————————————————————
Before you think that the author is “naturally” pursuing personal “interests” as a climate skeptic and paid by CO2 polluters, please note that he is merely a small business director who runs a small limited liability company, and is thus perhaps more free to speak up than the representatives of the global climate circus, many of whom we know have made impressive careers and are living very well.
Be skeptical whenever anyone makes 100-year prognoses because no one is able to really forecast the climate. Already in the 1960s a number of climatologists failed with their 100-year forecasts and beyond (ice age prognoses). The climate system is far too complex to allow us to simply make regional forecasts for climate development.
At the Donnerwetter.de Wetterpark in der Eifel, climate change is a big issue. We would be pleased about your visit and a discussion with you.

"We’re all too aware of the consequences of plastics in the oceans and on land. However, beyond the visible pollution of our once pristine habitats, plastics are having a grave impact on the climate too.  Newly published research calculates that across their lifecycle, plastics account for 3.8% of global greenhouse gas emissions. That’s almost double the emissions of the aviation sector. If it were a country, the “Plastic Kingdom” would be the fifth-highest emitter in the world. 


      Read more:
      Plastic is now part of our planet's fabric – a scientist and archaeologist discuss what happens next


 Demand is set to rise, too. At 380m tonnes a year, we produce 190 times more plastic than we did in 1950. If the demand for plastic continues to grow at its current rate of 4% a year, emissions from plastic production will reach 15% of global emissions by 2050. More than 99% of plastics are manufactured from petrochemicals, most commonly from petroleum and natural gas. These raw materials are refined to form ethylene, propylene, butene, and other basic plastic building blocks, before being transported to manufacturers. The production and transport of these resins requires an awful lot of energy – and therefore fuel. Greenhouse gas emissions also occur during the refining process itself – the “cracking” of larger hydrocarbons from petrochemicals into smaller ones suitable for making plastic releases carbon dioxide and methane. According to the study, about 61% of total plastic greenhouse gas emissions comes from the resin production and transport stage. A further 30% is emitted at the product manufacturing stage. The vast majority of these emissions come from the energy required to power the plants that turn raw plastic materials into the bottles, bin bags and bicycle helmets we use today. The remainder occurs as a result of chemical and manufacturing processes – for example, the production of plastic foams uses HFCs, particularly potent greenhouse gases. The remaining carbon footprint occurs when plastics are thrown away. Incineration releases all of the stored carbon in the plastic into the atmosphere, as well as air pollutants such as dioxins, furans, mercury and polychlorinated biphenyls, which are toxic and damaging to human health. As plastics take centuries to degrade, disposal in landfill makes only a small contribution to emissions in theory. However, as much as 40% of landfill waste is burnt in open skies, dramatically speeding up the release of otherwise locked-up carbon. If we are to combat climate breakdown, reductions in plastic emissions are clearly needed. Thankfully, the solution with the biggest potential is already in motion, albeit slow. In showing that transitioning to a zero carbon energy system has the potential to reduce emissions from plastic by 51%, the study provides yet another reason to rapidly phase out fossil fuels. 


      Read more:
      New net zero emissions target won't end UK's contribution to global warming – here's why


 However, beyond urgently required global decarbonisation, we need to reduce our seemingly insatiable demand for carbon-based plastic. Increasing recycling rates is one simple way of doing this. The highest-quality plastics can be recycled many times, and nearly all plastic can be recycled to some extent – but only 18% was actually recycled worldwide in 2015. Although each recycle process requires a small amount of new plastic, we can greatly increase the life cycle of the material by efficiently reusing what we make. A more fundamental solution is to switch to making plastics from biodegradable sources such as wood, corn starch, and sugar cane. The materials themselves are carbon neutral, although renewable power is essential to eliminate the climate impact of energy costs during production, transport and waste processing. However, a massive ramping up in the production of bioplastics – which currently make up less than 1% of total plastic production – would require vast swathes of agricultural land. With the population set to rise dramatically, increasingly coveted arable space may not be able to satisfy demand. The bottom line, therefore, is that we will need to reduce our demand for plastic. According to the study, simply reducing the annual growth in plastics demand from 4% to 2% could result in 60% lower emissions from the sector in 2050. While a life without plastics may seem unimaginable, its worth remembering that their prevalence is a relativity recent phenomenon. The first artificial plastic, Bakelite, was developed in 1907, but it wasn’t until the 1950s that the age of plastic began. If we show a genuine appetite to address plastic pollution, the world could change again just as quickly.  Governments, corporations, and individuals must make research into alternatives a priority, and support alternatives to needless plastic waste. Were most people to carry a reusable water bottle, for example, we could eliminate the need for the estimated 20,000 single-use bottles bought each second around the world.  Of course, any of these solutions alone will not be enough. As the recent study notes, only by combining reduction in demand, top-notch recycling, decarbonisation of energy, and large-scale adoption of bioplastics can we tackle plastic’s contribution to the climate crisis. But if we manage to do all of this, then we can cut plastics emissions to just 7% of current levels. Plastics need not be completely demonised as environmental scourges.

"**Hundreds of people have been wrongly told they have coronavirus by NHS Test and Trace after a laboratory error.**
More than 1,300 people who gave samples between 19 and 23 November received positive results, when the tests were actually void.
All of those affected will be told to take another test, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said.
Duncan Larcombe, whose daughter received the wrong result, said it was ""more than an inconvenient mistake"".
The PR company director, from Maidstone, Kent, said his two children, aged 14 and nine, were both sent home from school to self-isolate and he was unable to work.
He said his 14-year-old daughter had not left her bedroom for four days, with meals being left outside her door, until the family learned the result was void on Thursday.
""We were taking it very seriously,"" he said.
Mr Larcombe, a former royal editor at the Sun newspaper, said the mistake ""brings into question for me whether or not this testing system is competent"".
""The entire economy is relying on the competence of the testing laboratories and if they are not doing their job they need to be held to account,"" he said.
DHSC said it was an ""isolated incident"" caused by an ""issue with a batch of testing chemicals"" which had affected tests taken across the UK.
It is ""being fully investigated to ensure this does not happen again,"" the department said.
Mr Larcombe's daughter has now received a negative result after taking a second test on Thursday.
""Given that [the government] have just decided to put the whole of Kent in tier 3, you just wonder, is their modelling flawed,"" he said.
Asked if the 1,311 incorrect results would affect regional figures for infection rates, which are represented as the number of cases per 100,000 people, DHSC issued a statement saying: ""Any impact on regional figures would be minimal, but in any event this incident was taken into account when the tiering discussions took place."""

In times of tragedy, there always seems to be hucksters about trying to use that tragedy to sell a position, a product, or a belief. In ancient times, tragedy was the impetus used to appease the gods and to embrace religion to save yourselves. In light of this article on the Daily Caller Center for American Progress blames Republicans for devastating tornadoes it seems some opportunists just can’t break the pattern of huckster behavior in the face of disaster.
I can’t think of a more disgusting example of political opportunism that has occurred such as we witnessed today from The Center for American Progress via their Think Progress blog, as well as the New York Times op-ed piece that suggests predicting severe weather is little more than a guessing game. Certified Consulting Meteorologist Mike Smith of Wichita, KS based WeatherData Inc. said of the NYT piece:
The cruelty of this particular April, in the number of tornadoes recorded, is without equal in the United States.
This may or may not be true. The statement is at least premature. The NWS Storm Prediction Center March 8th changed its methodology which allows more reports of tornadoes and other severe storms to be logged (see first note here). We don’t know yet whether this is a record April.
Tornadoes in particular, researchers say, straddle the line between the known and the profoundly unknowable.

“There’s a large crapshoot aspect,” said Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo.

To add to the mix, Peter Gleick says at the Huffington Post  “More extreme and violent climate is a direct consequence of human-caused climate change (whether or not we can determine if these particular tornado outbreaks were caused or worsened by climate change).”
In the Think Progress piece, again, Dr. Trenberth is quoted: 
“Given that global warming is unequivocal,” climate scientist Kevin Trenberth cautioned the American Meteorological Society in January of this year, “the null hypothesis should be that all weather events are affected by global warming rather than the inane statements along the lines of ‘of course we cannot attribute any particular weather event to global warming.’”
It should also be noted that during that AMS conference in January, Dr. Trenberth called people who disagreed with that view “deniers” in front of hundreds of scientists, even after being called out on the issue he left the hateful term intact in his speech. Clearly, he is a man with a bias. From my perspective, these articles citing Trenberth are opportunistic political hucksterism at its finest. Unfortunately, many from these bastions of left leaning opininators don’t bother to cite some inconvenient facts, leaving their claims to be on par with superstitions that were the part of our dark past.
First, let’s look at the claim of tornadoes being on the increase, in parallel with the climate change that is claimed. In my previous essay Severe weather more common? Data shows otherwise I cited this graph from the National Climatic Data Center:

Obviously, when NCDC tallies the number of F3-F5 tornadoes from this recent outbreak, and gets around to updating that graph, there will be an uptick at the end in 2011 that is on par or even higher than the famous 1974 tornado outbreak. The point though is that despite the 1974 uptick, the trend was down.
The NYT article says:
The population of the South grew by 14.3 percent over the last decade, according to the Census Bureau, compared with 9.7 percent for the nation as a whole. Of those states hardest hit by tornadoes this year, some were among the fastest growing, notably Texas and North Carolina.
Let’s look at trends of tornado related deaths with population. From Harold Brooks. a research meteorologist with the NOAA National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, Oklahoma. we have this graph:

Source: NOAA’s US Severe Weather Blog, SPC, Norman Oklahoma
Let’s look at other figures. Today, Dr. Roger Pielke Junior got an updated graph from Harold Brooks at NOAA to bring it to 2010:

That graph is a testament to the improved lead times, accuracy, and and dissemination of severe weather warnings by the National Weather Service, whose members did an outstanding job during this severe weather event. CCM Mike Smith, in his book Warnings The True Story of How Science Tamed the Weather talks about the vast improvements we’ve witnessed since the early days of severe weather forecasting. He writes today of the recent outbreak:
There is no question that the current storm warning program, a collaborative effort of the National Weather Service, private sector weather companies like AccuWeather, broadcast meteorologists, and local emergency managers have saved hundreds of lives during these recent storms through excellent forecasts and warnings.  This image shows the tornado warning (red hatched area) for Birmingham that was issued more than 20 minutes before the tornado arrived.

Can the warning program be improved? Certainly. The National Weather Service’s new dual-polarization radar will improve flash flood warnings and will incrementally improve warnings of tornadoes that occur after dark.
But in the immediate aftermath of these tragic storms we seem to have learned two things:  People need to respond to today’s highly accurate warnings. For some reason, the media (see examples here and here seems determined to downplay the quality of the warnings which may have the effect of driving down response rates.
Second, they must have a place to take shelter. Most mobile home parks and many homes in the South do not have underground shelters or safe rooms. Mobile home parks and housing developments should look to constructing these in the future.
With 30 minutes of advance warning in this case, and many other advance warnings during this outbreak, plus the supersaturation of live television coverage, plus the fact that weeks in advance, my colleague Joe D’Aleo, co-founder of the Weather Channel and now at Weatherbell LLC,  discussed the likelihood of a super-outbreak of severe weather occurring due to the juxtaposition of cold air from snowpack in the northern plains with warm moist air in the south, it would seem Dr. Trenberth’s claim of “a large crapshoot aspect” doesn’t hold up. The death toll issue seems to be shelter, not lack of forecasts, warnings, or awareness. People knew the storms were coming, they just had few options for shelters that would survive at F3-F5 category tornado intensity.
The attempts at linking the tornado outbreak this week to “global warming” have been roundly criticized in the meteorological community. Just yesterday there was a denouncement of the tornadoes to global warming link in this story from Physorg.com
“If you look at the past 60 years of data, the number of tornadoes is increasing significantly, but it’s agreed upon by the tornado community that it’s not a real increase,” said Grady Dixon, assistant professor of meteorology and climatology at Mississippi State University.
“It’s having to do with better (weather tracking) technology, more population, the fact that the population is better educated and more aware. So we’re seeing them more often,” Dixon said.
But he said it would be “a terrible mistake” to relate the up-tick to climate change.
Anticipating this sort of nonsense in the current political climate that seeks to blame humans for the weather, last month, the National Weather Association, representing thousands of operational meteorologists, forecasters, and television-radio meteorologists in the United States adopted their first ever position statement on climate change and severe weather events. They state:
Any given weather event, or series of events, should not be construed as evidence of climate change.
…
The NWA emphasizes that no single weather event or series of events should be construed as evidence of a climate trend. Daily weather is subject to extreme events due to its natural variability. It is only the occurrence of these events over decades that determines a climate trend.
No clearer statement could be rendered. It mirrors what a NOAA scientist at the Storm Prediction Center said yesterday to Fox News:
Greg Carbin, the warning coordination meteorologist at NOAA’s Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma, said warming trends do create more of the fuel that tornadoes require, such as moisture, but that they also deprive tornadoes of another essential ingredient: wind shear.
“We know we have a warming going on,” Carbin told Fox News in an interview Thursday, but added: “There really is no scientific consensus or connection [between global warming and tornadic activity]….Jumping from a large-scale event like global warming to relatively small-scale events like tornadoes is a huge leap across a variety of scales.”
Asked if climate change should be “acquitted” in a jury trial where it stood charged with responsibility for tornadoes, Carbin replied: “I would say that is the right verdict, yes.” Because there is no direct connection as yet established between the two? “That’s correct,” Carbin replied.
Historically, there have been many tornado outbreaks that occurred well before climate change was on anyone’s radar.  Here’s a few:
1908 Southeast tornado outbreak 324 fatalities, ≥1,720 injuries
1920 Palm Sunday tornado outbreak ≥380 fatalities, ≥1215 injuries
1925 Tri-State tornado ≥747 fatalities, ≥2298 injuries
1932 Deep South tornado outbreak  ≥330 fatalities, 2145 injuries
1952 Arkansas-Tennessee tornado outbreak 208 fatalities
1965 Palm Sunday tornado outbreak 256 fatalities
April 3-4 1974 Super Outbreak 315 fatalities
All of these occurred before “climate change” was even on the political radar. What caused those if “global warming” is to blame? The real cause is La Niña, and as NOAAwatch.gov indicates on their page with the helpful meter, we are in a La Niña cycle of ocean temperature in the Pacific.

Here’s what it looks like on satellite measurements. Notice the cool blue:

The US. Climate Prediction Center talks about the reason for such outbreaks in relation to ocean temperature cycles:
What impacts do El Niño and La Niña have on tornado activity across the country?
Since a strong jet stream is an important ingredient for severe weather, the position of the jet stream helps to determine the regions more likely to experience tornadoes. Contrasting El Niño and La Niña winters, the jet stream over the United States is considerably different. During El Niño the jet stream is oriented from west to east across the southern portion of the United States. Thus, this region becomes more susceptible to severe weather outbreaks. During La Niña the jet stream and severe weather is likely to be farther north.

Note the collision zone in the US southeast during La Niña patterns.
Finally, Let’s examine the claims of global warming being linked to the tornado outbreak. If this were true, we’d expect the globe to be warmer, right?
Thunderstorms (and all weather for that matter) form in the troposphere, that layer of the atmosphere that is closest to the surface, and extends up to the stratosphere.
Image: weatherquestions.com - click for detailsDr. Roy Spencer, climate scientist from the University of Alabama, Huntsville, tracks the temperature of the troposphere. The university system that he tracks the temperature daily with is inoperable, due to the storms. People who have been watching it prior to this event know the current global tropospheric temperature is lower in April than the norm, but we can’t show it today. The last global value he plotted showed this:

The global temperature anomaly of the troposphere today is about the same as it was in 1979. If there’s any global warming in the troposphere, it must be a figment of an overactive imagination on the part of people who seek to link it to the recent tornado tragedy.
Dr. Roy Spencer sums it up pretty well on his blog today:
MORE Tornadoes from Global Warming? That’s a Joke, Right?
It is well known that strong to violent tornado activity in the U.S. has decreased markedly since statistics began in the 1950s, which has also been a period of average warming. So, if anything, global warming causes FEWER tornado outbreaks…not more. In other words, more violent tornadoes would, if anything, be a sign of “global cooling”, not “global warming”.
Anyone who claims more tornadoes are caused by global warming is either misinformed, pandering, or delusional.
The people that seek to link this tragedy to the political movement of climate change should be ashamed of themselves. The only “deniers” here are the ones who deny all the long established counter evidence of their bogus claims for political gain.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAtmospheric and ocean cycles are known to have profound effects on global weather and climate. A recent paper investigates the impacts of the southern westerly wind belt (SWW) and reveals that much remains unclear, and that the data show it “might be forced by solar variability”.
From that we could conclude that the ice melt on the Antarctic Peninsula may also be related to solar variations. Obviously this is another sign of yet another huge deficit with the”fine tuned” climate models.
Here’s the paper’s abstract:
Southern South America is the only landmass intersecting the southern westerly wind belt (SWW) that influences the large-scale oceanography and controls for example the outgassing of CO2 in the Southern Ocean. Therefore, paleo-reconstructions from southernmost Patagonia are of global interest and an increasing number of paleoclimate records have been published during the last decades. We provide an overview on the different records mostly covering the Holocene but partly extending into the Late Glacial based on a large variety of archives and proxies.
We particularly discuss possible reasons for regionally diverging palaeoclimatic interpretations and summarize potential climate forcing mechanisms. The Deglacial and Holocene temperature evolution of the region including the adjacent Pacific Ocean indicates “Antarctic” pattern and timing consistent with glacier re-advances during the Antarctic Cold Reversal. Some records indicate a significant accumulation control on the glacier fluctuations related to changes in SWW strength and/or position.
Reconstructions of Holocene changes in the SWW behaviour provide partly inconsistent and controversially discussed pattern. While records from the hyperhumid side point to a stronger or southward displaced SWW core during the Early Holocene thermal maximum, records from the lee-side of the Andes show either no long term trend or the opposite, suggesting enhanced westerlies during the late Holocene “Neoglacial”. Likewise, centennial-scale global or hemispheric cold intervals, such as the Little Ice Age, have been interpreted in terms of enhanced and reduced SWW strength. Some SWW variations can be linked to changes in the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) consistent with instrumental climate data-sets and might be ultimately forced by solar variability. Resolving these inconsistencies in southernmost Patagonian SWW records is a prerequisite for improving hemispheric comparisons and links to atmospheric CO2 changes.”

We must stop pollution for reasons of biosphere toxicity, **NOT because of climate change.** The TSI model of solar forcing ignores nearly all climate forcing aspects of space weather AND applies that forcing to the human total. This video shows that fact in a way that anyone can understand.

Every year, as temperatures approach their July peak, our greener friends trot out global warming horrors and even more horrible policies—witness President Obama’s recently proposed diktats. But this year it’s different, as some conservatives are pushing a oxymoronic “revenue neutral” carbon tax.



You’d think people in D.C. might learn from others. Just last month, precisely such a tax took down Australia’s Prime Minister, Julia Gillard. She had succeeded Kevin Rudd, who was bounced out of office for his support of a cap‐​and‐​trade scheme. Rudd is now temporarily back, likely to be replaced when his Labour party pays the ultimate price for Gillard’s tax in September’s general election.





In Washington, bad ideas are never in short supply.



Washington’s version of political suicide is the brainchild of former Congressman Bob Inglis (R-SC), who lost his primary by a 70–29 margin when he got global warming religion. He now heads the “Energy and Enterprise Initiative” at R Street Partners, a relatively new Washington think tank which split off from Chicago’s libertarian/​conservative Heartland Institute over their aggressive stance on climate change.



Inglis’ theory—you can’t make this kind of stuff up—is that his tax is going to be magically adopted by Congress in some type of grand deal during President Obama’s last year. Ask yourself: when was the last time the opposition party made big deals with a lame duck Administration?



Every polemic I have seen on the carbon tax—including Inglis’—particularly and specifically ignores recent global warming science in complete contravention of a mountain of evidence now accruing that global warming was dramatically over forecast by scientists who had every incentive to do just that. Furthermore, with regard to “revenue neutrality,’ the notion that gazillions of dollars will float through Washington “unmolested” (h/​t to Heritage’s David Kreutzer for that zinger) is as foolhardy as ignoring what is happening in climate science.



Ignoring the science means disregarding 14 separate experiments published in the scientific literature in the last two years, all showing that way too much global warming was forecast. The fact that there isn’t any temperature trend whatsoever in the last 16 years is forcing scientists to confront the reality that the carbon taxers are choosing to evade.



The failure of the forecasts of dramatic warming is systematic. A presentation in late June at the American Geophysical Union’s Washington meeting on climate science and policy, titled “Policy Implications of Climate Models on the Verge of Failure,” demonstrated that, using the normative rules of science, the forecasts presuming big warming must now be abandoned.



One can use the EPA’s own model (curiously, acronymed MAGICC) to assess the effects on global temperature of emissions reductions that would be caused by a carbon tax. Assuming outrageously high taxes that would reduce them by 83% (giving Americans the per‐​capita emissions of 1867), the amount of warming that would be prevented is too small to measure on the 50‐​year time scale. Anything less does even less.



Irrationalities like conservatives supporting something that cannot happen (a revenue‐​neutral energy tax) don’t arise in a vacuum, which prompts some speculation as to who is supplying the massive amount of money needed to propagandize something that seems so absurd.



A recent Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analysis, “Effects of a Carbon Tax on the Economy and the Environment” may include a clue. The report is pretty much boilerplate except for where it departs into a specific section on the implementation of the tax on coal producers:



 _“…analysts suggest that because the bulk of coal is used to generate electricity, emissions resulting from coal could be covered by taxing electricity generators on the basis of their actual emissions”._



Whose analysts?



Taxing coal at the point of electricity generation will be a decreasing expense to the industry (since EPA has pretty much outlawed any new coal‐​fired power plants), more than made up for by the bonanza of tax‐​free coal “leaking” from the highly‐​regulated U.S. to ports around the world.



Maybe this explains the sudden emergence of a bizarre carbon tax based on a completely irrational set of assumptions being aggressively pushed by an obscure think tank and a former congressman.



Or maybe it doesn’t. In Washington, bad ideas are never in short supply.

"With the promise that Tesla’s Model S will “liberate its owners from the petroleum-burning paradigm”, this electric car is an example of just how far technological innovation could take us towards achieving carbon emissions reduction targets and reducing consumption of fossil fuels.  The technology is certainly impressive but it is concerning to see innovation of this kind being held up as the holy grail of a more sustainable future – especially if it comes at the expense of pursuing other ways to solve the problem. One reason why the Model S has caused such excitement is its matching of conventional cars in performance, design and desirability. Many of the previous shortfalls of electric vehicles, such as acceleration, driving range and battery life have been addressed. The UK government’s target of “almost” every van and car being emission free by 2050 is starting to look more reasonable and the hype is alluring: technology has resolved the problem and life can carry on as normal.  It’s worth reminding ourselves that although the Model S produces zero emissions, electric cars use electricity and this has to be generated somehow. As a recent OECD report points out, electric cars displace their emissions to the energy generation sector, rather than remove them entirely. In this sense, zero emission vehicles would only arrive with an entirely de-carbonised electricity supply – which is hard to imagine. Even the Treasury’s 2008 King review of low carbon cars, whose key recommendations underpin UK electric vehicle policy, recognised the extent of progress that was required if low-carbon electricity generation was to meet the 80% carbon emissions reduction target.  In environmental terms, electric vehicles are an answer to the wrong question. For the past decade or so, national policy has framed the problem of private car use and the environment in increasingly narrow terms. In the early 1990s, sustainable transport policy was concerned with a broad set of issues. These included road congestion, the loss of countryside and the disturbance of rural and semi-rural areas due to road building or the reallocation of land for parking. Now the problem is debated only in terms of emissions targets. National policy in relation to all forms of transport is heavily focused on vehicle technology to the detriment of other possibilities. These policies actually reinforce current patterns of consumption, tying us to a future in which the use of private cars continues to dominate and increase. This is reflected in the substantial road building programme which comes part and parcel with low-emissions vehicle policy.  Rather than relying on ambitious technological development to provide sustainable transport in the future we might instead invest more in developing ways to challenge the car as the dominant means of getting around, and reducing the car dependence that permeates so many aspects of our everyday lives.  This is not uncharted territory, and there are several places we might turn for inspiration. One example from the mid-1990s is the government’s own planning guidance notes that were explicitly aimed at halting steadily increasing car use. The notes to local authority planners proposed various measures: requiring new developments to be accessible via a range of modes of transport, locating traffic-generating activities such as places of employment so they are highly accessible by public transport, and by making driving more difficult, for example from parking restrictions, limited parking bays and pedestrianisation of roads. But as guidance and not legislation, local authorities were left in an invidious position. If they applied the guidance then they risked  developers passing over them in favour of neighbouring areas. The alternative was to give the green light to projects that further embed car-use. And this kind of planning only creates the conditions for less car use; it doesn’t guarantee it – but at least the policy ambition was there. There is some potential for optimism when it comes to contemporary policy though. Some recent Department for Transport documents set out ambitious goals which break from the status quo. These include the Door-to-door strategy, which aims to encourage alternatives to private cars for trips of any length (not just those under five miles), and reducing the need to travel through telecommuting and flexible working.  Though less immediately measurable than a car that produces zero emissions, I’d suggest these ambitions for social change hold just as much promise as technology – and more. Our trust in techno-fix solutions, though misguided, illustrates that we have vision. Let’s use this to address some more relevant questions. "

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf Germany had recorded a record 5 warmer winters in a row, people would be reading and hearing about it for days without end. However, just the opposite has occurred: Germany has now experienced 5 colder than normal winters in a row – “a record” – now made official by the German Weather Service (This winter 0.6°C below 1981-2010 average). Yet, hardly a peep from the media on this.
But the media peeps are beginning!
At least one arm of the German mainstream media has reported this. In its Panorama section, German online daily Die Welt has an article about the recent trend, written by Ulli Kulke. The introduction reads:
Spring is just around the corner, at least from a meteorological point of view. However Germany is stuck in a record winter without sun and warmth.”
According to meteorologists, since daily sunshine measurements began in 1951, no DJF German winter has been so cloudy and dreary in Germany as this 2012/13 winter. Moreover the DJF mean temperature for the country was 0.6°C cooler than the 1981 – 2010 average. That makes it the fifth winter in a row this has occurred – a record.
Kulke quotes meteorologist Dominik Jung:
In this regard Jung says: ‘The earlier climate projections, i.e. the climate prognoses of the 1980s and 1990s, have, at least for Germany, more or less massively faltered over the last years.'”
The models have not only been wrong for the winters but also for the summers, Kulke writes, citing Jung on prognoses made for hotter and drier summers:
…of the last 10 summers only one was too dry, and that was the summer of 2003, […] otherwise all other summers were normal or too wet.”

What’s worse for the climate models the Met Office forecasts the cooler weather to continue at least through 2017, Kulke writes. Even IPCC chairman and ultra-warmist Rajendra Pachauri recently conceded the cool trend might last “30 or 40 years“.
Die Welt writes that the recent trend may provide “a tailwind in the climate discussion” for those who claim that “the impact of the sun on climate change over the last decades has been underestimated far too much, and that the role of CO2 exaggerated – which by and large has been supported by two new peer-reviewed studies in journals this year.”
Die Welt adds on the cosmic ray – cloud formation – cooling theory:

Theoretically this relationship has been known a long time. The parallelism between global temperature and solar activity over the past 1000 years appears to confirm it.”

Indeed the theory is so compelling that even CERN and the Danish National Space Center in Copenhagen are conducting large scale, extensive experiments and studies on it. Die Welt now appears to be opening up to a new climate theory:
“…the results could deliver new explosive material for the climate discussion.”
This truly marks a change in direction for Die Welt.
No matter what is claimed, one thing is certain: The climate discussion is now progressing ahead in Germany with the massive, unstoppable inertia of a glacier, grinding to a pulp every false claim in its path.
Observe how the mainstream German media is coming around and conceding the discussion is indeed far from over, acknowledging that the solar theory is real and gathering in strength, and that warming has unexpectedly stopped.

Good old _Stuff & Nonsense_ are beating the climate emergency drum as loud as they can. One has to wonder what financial inducements there are behind this _Stuff & Nonsense_ campaign for them to be so hard out on the climate crises and so low on facts and reality.



For example, a church being drowned by the rising sea levels. An emergency? A crisis? No. **Nothing to do with the climate whatsoever.**



When Mary Ann San Jose moved to Sitio Pariahan more than two decades ago, she could walk to the local chapel. Today, reaching it requires a swim. 



The main **culprit is catastrophic subsidence caused by groundwater being pumped out from below** , often via unregulated wells for homes, factories, and farms catering to a booming population and growing economy.



  
For this congregation, it is absolutely a crisis and it is absolutely man-made but it is **absolutely nothing to do with CO** **2** **.**



No wonder _Stuff_ will not allow comments on any climate ‘crisis’ article.

The controversial Department of Homeland Security (DHS) report _Rightwing Extremism: Current Economic and Political Climate Fueling Resurgence in Radicalization and Recruitment_ stirred criticism that the DHS had turned away from monitoring real terrorism plots and was now labeling veterans, pro‐​life groups, and limited government advocates as threats to national security. Consider those fears vindicated.   
  
  
Americans for Limited Government (ALG) filed a Freedom of Information Act request for the documents and correspondence that supported the DHS report. The result: DHS sent a letter and list of the sources used to assess a significant number of innocent Americans as potential terrorists.   
  
  
Seriously, read the whole thing. This collection of open source material amounts to an afternoon of internet browsing. Several arrests and indictments are mentioned, but newspapers and blogs are used instead of primary documents such as _actual_ arrest reports and indictments that are available over the internet.   
  
  
When a government agency charged with the physical security of the nation’s borders is running around on the internet looking for accusations of racism instead of using actual law enforcement and intelligence reports to justify its threat assessments, we are all in trouble. As Jeffrey Rosen has said, the biggest problem with DHS is that it was “a bureaucratic and philosophical mistake.”   
  
  
Create a bureaucracy designed to inflate fears and issue color‐​coded threat levels, and that is what you will get.

At first glance, prospects for economic liberalism in the UK appear gloomy, whatever tomorrow’s result.



Corbyn’s socialism speaks for itself. But the Conservatives’ slide away from liberal economics continues. Boris Johnson’s last Cabinet, on paper, arguably had the strongest “dry” economic credentials of any since the 19th century. Yet recent announcements for new protectionist state aid laws, “buy British” plans for public bodies, cancellation of corporation tax cuts, and the embrace of government spending as a proxy for public service quality, appear to provide evidence of an ongoing statist shift in the party’s mindset.



Many economic liberals feel despair towards both the Conservatives and Labour as a result. _The Economist_ election leader epitomised that reflex. Yes, it acknowledged, Corbyn’s socialism was beyond the pale. But so was Johnson, who’d “accelerated the shift from an economically and socially liberal party into an economically interventionist and culturally conservative one.” By erecting new trade barriers and ending free movement, Brexit is seen by many liberal commentators as anti‐​liberal by definition. A new more working‐​class Tory‐​voting coalition will inevitably change the Conservatives’ electoral offer away from free markets too, so conventional wisdom goes.



Should economic classical liberals despair? We certainly should be worried by today’s political currents. But if the polls are right, I think we should also be cautiously thankful for the stay of execution that Johnson’s leadership and manifesto have given us, using that reprieve for some self‐​reflection of our own strategy.



Despite claims to the contrary, leaving the EU is not “anti‐​liberal by definition.” Ask Remainers. One of their well‐​worn worries is that the UK outside the EU might become a Singapore‐​on‐​Thames — a low tax economy with light regulations and privatised healthcare. Brexit broadens the range of political possibilities, for good or ill, to include _Liberaltopia_. Whether a more economically liberal Britain arises depends on how we use those repatriated powers over decades. Brexit is for life, not just for Christmas.



Things could be much worse than Johnson in the near term too. Just six years ago, _The Economist_ heralded him as a great social and economic liberal. He’s been a long‐​time champion of immigration, anti‐​the nanny state, a trailblazer in the party for social liberties, and instinctively a low‐​tax Tory. Of course, he’s always had a penchant for big infrastructure projects and high minimum wages — he’s no libertarian. But it’s uncontroversial to believe he’s more liberal than his party, and more liberal than current public attitudes.



True, under his leadership, the party has pledged significant public spending increases. But these have been, by and large, highly targeted on frontline public services. To conflate the Conservative drift for higher spending on core government functions after years of restraint with a Labour party intent on delivering the biggest state in our history, confiscating company shares, and renationalising swathes of the economy, is false equivalence. Defeating Corbynism would be economic liberalism’s biggest defensive victory since 1979.



Recent Conservatives announcements on state aid and populist lines on migration are more disturbing. But given the broader climate of opinion, we free‐​marketeers might be grateful for small mercies. Johnson is not imbued with a desire to max out the “the good government can do” a la May. His liberal instincts (and those of many around him) are surely why the May tidal wave of new bans has receded and why the manifesto didn’t contain any misguided agenda to “reform capitalism.” Indeed, what we appear to be seeing from Johnson is not a government‐​loving “Borisism”, but a focus‐​group driven agenda — trying to win an election by addressing voter’s stated concerns. And doing so in a zeitgeist inhospitable to free market ideas.



Electoral politics doesn’t occur in a vacuum. Politics is the final act. We must therefore avoid concluding from timelines, instead judging Johnson against real counterfactuals. We are in a period where major reform of capitalism is a drumbeat through the pages of the _Financial Times_. Where Davos men suggest businesses move away from focus on profits. Where rapid decarbonisation, devoid of costs considerations, is taken seriously. Where business groups are unwilling or unable to defend the market economy, even with socialist barbarians at the gates.



Such an environment is the product of years of ceding bad arguments to capitalism’s critics, while failing to revise policies that centralise power and make people’s lives worse. Given prevailing conventional wisdom, the real surprise was that the manifesto was not more anti‐​market. When you see Donald Trump’s protectionist agenda, Corbyn’s manifesto, and the demands of new Tory think‐​tanks, Johnson is arguably offering the least possible change consistent with the feelings of the age.



Let’s put it another way: is there any other current Conservative MP who is more instinctively liberal than Boris who could have transformed the party’s electoral prospects over the past three months to be close to winning this election? Whatever tomorrow’s outcome, the answer is a bracing one for those who believe in economic freedom.



The hard truth we economic liberals must now face is that Britain is once again dominated by collectivist thinking. The Conservatives have been on a very, very slow drift away from market economics over a 25‐​year period. Thatcherism proved an interlude in terms of advancement of market‐​based policies. Subsequent years saw those gains defended, but in recent times a “drip, drip” of anti‐​market interventions and proposals has now become a flood of demands for new misguided interventions. Yes, Johnson has let some through. But there could have been many more with a different leader.



Whether or not a Conservative majority is secured tomorrow, the UK’s economic liberals need desperately to rethink strategy. First: time, energy, and resources need to be put into the institutions that seek to change the broader climate of opinion, rather than affect near‐​term politics. A naive view that many instinctively held — that with just the right Conservative leader and personnel, economic liberalism would flourish — is clearly misguided. A free‐​market Conservative party will only re‐​appear when there is electoral demand for one. The past four years are an early warning sign.



Second, we should be relieved by Boris’s priorities and his manifesto focusing on principles, which leaves opportunities for influence. Johnson has made clear his desire to raise productivity levels and economic growth. He wants to address living costs for poorer families. And he wants to raise investment — both public and private. Economically liberal policies have much to offer here. So after the election, the purer policy‐​oriented think‐​tanks should grasp the opportunity to devise sound economic policy ideas that fulfil such objectives, and work hard to show why other anti‐​market drifts are misguided.



Yuval Levin defines conservatism as “gratefulness.” We free‐​marketeers obviously dislike current anti‐​liberal machinations on all sides. But tomorrow we can hopefully be grateful for what we still have.

"It was hailed as a great victory for conservation, common sense and people power. Last year the European Commission finally voted to phase out the shameful practice of discarding hundreds of thousands of tonnes of perfectly good fish, either by-catch or target species caught over the allowable quota, as permitted by the EU Common Fisheries Policy (CFP).  Although hundreds of scientists, NGOs, politicians and legislators worked behind the scenes to make this happen, the issue really hit the public consciousness through the work of the mop-haired part-time celebrity chef/eco-warrior, Hugh Fearnley Whittingstall. His Fish Fight TV series exposed the images of tonnes of dead fish being dumped overboard to the public. In fact his campaign was so successful that over 870,000 people signed his petition to end discards, and he was granted personal meetings with Maria Damanaki, the European Fisheries Commissioner. So why are we now seeing headlines suggesting the discard ban could actually harm wildlife, and that Fish Fight’s campaign was misleading? Hugh was even given the Paxman treatment in a debate on Newsnight.  This renewed interest has been spurred by the publication of a paper in the journal Nature Communications by Professor Mike Heath and colleagues at the University of Strathclyde that examines the knock-on effects of a discard ban.  Using an ecosystem model of the North Sea, the paper’s authors examined the effect of two different management approaches. The first simulated the fishers’ obligation to land all catch (the discard ban), including undersize (ie, juvenile) or unwanted (ie, by-catch) fish, by inflating the landing quotas accordingly. The second simulated the same landing obligation, but added an element which added fishers efforts to be more selective and avoid unwanted catch by maintaining lower quotas. Not surprisingly, the first option had negative effects on marine ecosystems. Not only would it result in increased pressure on fish stocks – it removes more fish from the sea – but by removing the discards it would also remove a source of food scavenged upon by seabirds, marine mammals and seabed creatures. There might be some short-term economic benefits to fishers, but in the long term the catch rates are likely to be unsustainable, and the oceans in general will suffer. This is the story that has been seized upon by the media and some sections of the fishing industry, because it is the option being considered by the European Commission. Surely no one is suggesting that we go back to the bad old days and try to maintain a marine ecosystem that relies on us throwing away 30-40% of the fish we catch each year? In the North Sea alone, this is can account for hundreds of thousands of tonnes each year. And despite some counter-claims this week, this rate of discarding has remained relatively constant for several decades.    The second management scenario, which encourages more selective fishing, has to be the better way to go. That way catch rates are more sustainable, scientists gain better data on the fisheries, and the previously discarded material stays in the sea where it can be part of a more natural food chain. What evidence is there that the discard ban, or to be more politically correct, landing obligation, will work? Discard bans have been successfully implemented elsewhere in the world, including in the Alaskan and British Columbian groundfish trawl fisheries, and fisheries in New Zealand, Icelandic, Faroese and Norwegian waters.  A couple of years ago one of my MSc students, Ben Diamond, and I examined the effectiveness of the Norwegian discard ban and whether or not a similar policy should be introduced to the North Sea. Norway introduced a discard ban for cod and haddock in 1987, and has progressively applied it to more species since. Instead of increasing pressure on fish stocks, the discard ban, in combination with real-time closures of waters that contain high concentrations of juvenile fish, has encouraged fishermen to install fishing gear modifications that are more selective in the fish they catch.  As a result, improving data and understanding of fishing mortality has led to better management advice and more sensible fishing quotas. There were some short-term economic costs to the fishing industry, but today the Norwegian and Barents Sea fisheries are among the most prosperous in the world. It’s about time that a similar system is introduced in the North Sea, and in fact as widely as possible throughout European waters.  When the European Commission comes to decide on how to implement the CFP reform, we must hope it will ignore those lobbying for short-term interests, and instead take note of the long-term success of our northern neighbours."
"The Thwaites glacier is one of the most rapidly changing in Antarctica. It’s been the focus of considerable attention in recent weeks, after scientists suggested that this sector of the huge West Antarctic Ice Sheet was already on route towards collapse due to warming ocean temperatures. A major collapse of this part of the ice sheet could have dire consequences worldwide, with a global sea level rise of potentially up to 1m. Some models suggest this could take place comparatively rapidly, within a few centuries. But hidden beneath the kilometres of ice in this rapidly changing part of the continent is a largely unexplored geological feature: the West Antarctic Rift System, a strip of volcanic activity thought to extend for more than 3,000km across the Antarctic continent, provides further heat to melt the ice sheet from below. The rift is where the Earth’s crust has in the past been stretched, pushing magma near to the surface and causing widespread volcanic activity. It’s important to establish the amount of volcanic heat from the rift in order to more accurately predict the response of the Thwaites glacier and entire West Antarctic Ice Sheet to the effects of a warming climate and ocean.  Direct measurements of the geothermal heat flux from the rift are however difficult and expensive to obtain – the overlying ice sheet is in places 4km thick. Estimates of geothermal heat flux available so far are derived mainly from satellite magnetic data or seismology that struggle to resolve the regional details required to understand what effects the heat would have on the ice sheet.  In a paper published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the US, researchers from the Institute for Geophysics at The University of Texas, Austin, report a new method of estimating the geothermal heat flux beneath Thwaites glacier. Using radar data to map how water flows under the ice sheet and estimate ice melting rates, they have identified significant sources of high geothermal heat. According to lead author Dustin Shroeder (who now works at NASA), these appear to be distributed over a much wider area than previously thought. The minimum average geothermal heat flow beneath Thwaites glacier is about 100 milliwatts per square metre, with some hotspots reaching 200 milliwatts per square metre. This is considerably higher than the average heat flow of the Earth’s continents, at less than 65 milliwatts per square metre.  Detecting such high geothermal heat flux within this part of West Antarctic Rift means that there is likely to be much more water beneath Thwaites glacier. The presence of water can lubricate and speed up the flow of glaciers, even in the deep interior of the ice sheet kilometres beneath the surface. Several models used to simulate the present ice sheet assume much lower geothermal heat for the region, or less variability in heat flow than what the study team has proposed. As Schoreder said, the combination of heat and water interacting with the glacier’s base could “threaten the stability of Thwaites glacier in ways that we never before imagined.” We need to carry out further geophysical research, with other methods, to validate the predictions of such high geothermal heat that the team has derived from radar data analysis alone. Magnetic and gravity methods have been used, for example, to study rifts and geothermal heat flux patterns in many regions worldwide, and could be applied here to obtain an independent perspective. We also need more data and further computer modelling to try to understand more fully what impact this high geothermal heat has on the flow of water underneath glaciers, how this affects ice sheet dynamics, and ultimately how this will further our understanding of how Antarctica is responding to a warming world. This remarkable study is focused on the variability of geothermal heat beneath the Thwaites glacier that may have a bearing on ice dynamics in this vulnerable part of Antarctica. The level of heat in the rift system inferred from radar probe data doesn’t imply that ocean warming driven by global warming is not a significant contributor to the ice loss seen in this part of West Antarctica.  This study does not address ice sheet stability directly at all – it neither supports nor refutes the recent studies’ conclusions that the Thwaites glacier is already on route to collapse. But better understanding of how geothermal heat affects the flow of water underneath glaciers will allow us to develop improved models to better predict ice sheet behaviour, and ultimately how Antarctica is responding to a warming world."
"**Residents at a care home in North Yorkshire are being rehoused due to safety concerns.**
Glencoe Care Home in Whitby was recently rated as ""inadequate"" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), which found flaws with its coronavirus controls and fire safety.
North Yorkshire County Council said it was working with residents and families to find new homes for those affected.
Harmony Care Enterprise Ltd, which runs the home, has been asked to comment.
The home, on Chubb Hill Road, which had 16 residents when it was inspected on 8 October, must now work with the CQC to make improvements if it is to reopen.
In its report, the CQC said: ""Risks to people were not appropriately managed or recorded.
""Equipment had not been checked at regular intervals to ensure it remained safe and fire risks had not been adequately assessed or managed.""
It added that staff were not wearing personal protective equipment properly and government Covid-19 guidance ""had not been followed which placed people at increased risk"".
Speaking to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, Richard Webb, from North Yorkshire County Council, said: ""Sadly, the provider has not been able to make the rapid changes needed to ensure people receive safe and appropriate care, without the continued presence of council staff.
""We have therefore had to make the difficult decision to move people to alternative care homes where we can be assured they will receive the standards of care required.""

When I first started to read this article by Martin van Beynen, I thought it was just another attack on those of the right-hand side of the political divide, but it is slightly more insightful than that. It reflects a lot of the things that people are saying on this blog; that National is losing its way… it is ‘Labour lite’… it is hard to differentiate between National and Labour these days… and so on. 



Conservatives mostly feel that their politics are being watered down by so-called right-leaning politicians who buy into the climate change hype or support the government in rushing through legislation banning semi-automatic weapons. Many National supporters feel very let down by the party at the moment, and we are not alone.



Around the world old school conservative parties are in trouble. In the United States, Donald Trump has rewritten the Republican rule book and in Britain, Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party is more popular than the Tories. These outliers have replaced traditional conservatism with a populist agenda.  
Forms of this populism have taken over in Italy, Hungary and Poland and are rising in the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, and France. The belief something fundamentally important has been lost in the brave new global world lies behind them. 



A lot of this is to do with uncontrolled immigration, particularly in Eastern Europe, but Britain is an interesting case. The Conservatives are dying in a ditch at the moment, but the only credible alternative in a first-past-the-post system is Jeremy Corbyn, who is the least popular party leader in several decades. No wonder British voters are looking elsewhere. We have a similar problem here.



Populism is difficult to define. It means different things in different countries. It is generally an appeal to gut reactions about race, national culture, class, immigration and globalism. Some glibly call it the rage of white men who see their entitlements and privilege threatened but, speaking from experience, most white men are not that entitled and not very privileged either.  
The politics of populism is also usually nostalgic, building on a myth the old order was working fine until power shifted to people with some crazy ideas. 



Van Beynen’s ideas of populism are probably about 30 years out of date. Nowadays, people on the right of the political divide are looking to protect things like free speech, women’s sports and above all, their own cultures, because of uncontrolled immigration of people with drastically different values. We always had immigration, but the ‘old order’ was indeed working fine, until some idiotic leaders just decided to throw open the doors and let in marauding hordes. Populism these days is not about nostalgia; it is about survival in the face of invasion. 



If National turned populist, it would probably attack the state’s renewed focus on redress for Maori and Maori culture. Don Brash nearly won an election with this strategy. It would disparage political correctness and have a crack at what it would call the sneering and out-of-touch political class. 



Another fertile target would be the indisputably left wing media and academia and it would throw doubt on the new gun legislation as an infringement of the rights of people who have done nothing wrong. Israel Folau would be a poster boy for free speech and farmers and physical workers actually producing things would be championed. 



One set of laws for everyone? A balanced media? Amendments to poorly enacted, rushed gun legislation? Free speech? Better productivity? I have said this before, but why would anyone, especially a journalist, NOT think that they are all things to be cherished?



Conservative parties have often claimed to represent “the silent majority”, a term used by Richard Nixon to suggest the critics of American involvement in the Vietnam War and his other policies were a noisy minority.



The silent majority doesn’t write letters to the newspaper, it doesn’t get involved in campaigns and probably doesn’t join political parties. It reserves its voice for the ballot box, if it votes at all. But it is conservative and National has to work out how it can again be its voice. Growing inequality makes that difficult because National is not traditionally the party for Kiwi battlers.



Comments on this blog suggest that the ‘silent majority’ are shifting their votes to ACT or the New Conservatives, who at least try to champion the issues that are important to middle of the road voters. National is most certainly failing in that.



National must be wondering, like the Republicans and Tories, if social trends towards a more diverse and urban society have left it behind. It will have to decide whether it attacks Jacinda Ardern’s commanding position on the high moral ground. 



  
It needs to do something. It seems to be bleeding support at the moment, with a wishy-washy leader and very little in the way of firm policy for voters to agree or disagree with.



If it is not careful, National could go the way of the Conservatives in Britain, which is under threat of being turned into a minor party. That is what happens when you ask your voters what they want, and then deliberately ignore them.

"The world generated 242 million tonnes of plastic waste in 2016 – a figure that’s expected to grow by 70% in the next 30 years. But this same plastic is also a commodity that’s sold and traded in a global industry that generates US$200 billion every year.  Exporting plastic waste is one way rich countries dispose of their waste. By selling waste to firms that then send it to countries where recycling costs are cheaper, rich countries can avoid the unpleasant task of finding somewhere at home to dispose of it. Unfortunately, most of this waste is shipped to countries that aren’t equipped to properly manage it. When wealthy countries export their plastic waste to poorer countries with weaker recycling capacity, those plastics are often dumped, eventually polluting the land and sea. But a recent UN decision could help those countries most affected by plastic litter and with the least capacity to manage it. Due to a little-known treaty called the Basel Convention, poorer countries can now say no to the deluge of exported waste. The Basel Convention was adopted by the UN in 1989 to manage the flow of toxic waste sent from rich to poor countries. It’s cheaper for wealthy countries to relocate their waste to areas with lower costs and oversight, and so opportunities to abuse the system emerge. Italian waste management firms made headlines in 1988 because they stored hazardous wastes in a Nigerian fishing village, in drums labelled as building materials. For years Canada delayed repatriating waste – including nappies – dumped by a Canadian firm in the Philippines. The refuse has been sitting in the sun there since 2013.  The images of plastic waste piling up on beaches in many developing countries, including on some of the world’s most remote islands, prompted an effort led by Norway to use the Basel Convention for its original purpose.  The negotiations held in Geneva over two weeks were intended to bring urgent action to address a complex issue. A few countries, such as Argentina and the US, were more cautious, as exporters of plastic waste themselves. They, like the recycling industry, warned that regulations could make it more difficult to recycle plastic, at a time when much more needs to be recycled. Statements went on for hours as developing countries recounted the plastics littering their lands, seas, beaches and even glaciers. Norway brought forward a proposal to change how the treaty regulates plastics, by moving many types of plastics from the “non-hazardous” category to a list of wastes “of special concern.” Starting in 2020, this will require developing countries to be informed if these plastics are in a waste shipment. With this information, countries can give, or revoke, their “prior informed consent”. For the first time, developing countries can refuse a shipment of plastics with the backing of international law. This decision only applies to low-value, hard-to-recycle plastics. Think of food packaging or single-use water bottles: the plastics are soiled or mixed together (the lid, label, and bottle are different types of plastic), making them difficult to recycle. Most recyclers don’t want these plastics, which don’t generate a profit and increasingly are dumped in the landfills of poor countries. Research shows how cheap plastics leach persistent organic pollutants into the environment – a particularly nasty group of chemicals that are toxic, travel through air and water over long distances, accumulate in animal tissue (including humans), and last a long time. More than 233 marine species have ingested plastic and litter has reached the deepest parts of the ocean. The trade in global plastics is one driver of this problem, so giving developing countries the right to know what is entering their country and to refuse it is an appropriate solution to waste dumping.  China, previously the world’s largest importer of plastics for recycling, banned the import of cheap and contaminated plastics in 2018, displacing plastic waste to other countries. China’s neighbours, such as Indonesia, and Malaysia, shouldered a heavier burden, particularly since countries like the UK continue to export over 600,000 tonnes of plastic a year. Rich countries tend to produce the most plastic waste in the world per person and have better systems for managing it. If cheap and easy routes for dumping plastics close, wealthier countries may have to find ways to compel recycling companies to deal with their cheap plastics domestically. This agreement is only the start, but it could empower poorer countries to refuse the deluge of plastics that ultimately end up lingering on their shores. In time, it may help redress some of the burning injustices in the global waste trade."

Share this...FacebookTwitterYesterday’s print edition of Germany’s high-brow weekly Die Zeit has a full three-page feature story on the growing climate science skepticism in the USA and Germany titled “The Climate Warriors” authored by Kerstin Kohlenberg and Anita Blasberg.

The Climate Godfather Marc Morano
In their latest drive-by piece Die Zeit takes dead aim at Marc Morano, the Heartland Institute, the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE), Fritz Vahrenholt and other communicators of the skeptic message, and contrasts them to an innocent, tormented Michael Mann. Die Zeit’s message is clear: If you challenge climate science, then you’ll be portrayed as aggressors by Germany’s mainstream media.
The godfather of climate science skepticism
Their piece begins with a large color photo (not the one shown above) of a godfather-like appearing Marc Morano, who Die Zeit portrays as the communication and climate skepticism kingpin. The only thing missing from the photo is Richard Lindzen kissing his hand.
Under the god-father Morano photo they write:
Marc Morano in the small Virginia town of Reston. The PR strategist unleashed the climate denier’s  global campaign.”
Die Zeit holds Morano responsible for single-handedly spreading skepticism worldwide. “…Morano appears in America’s living rooms; a stocky figure in the mid forties, donning a suit and tie. He has a friendly smile that fools you.”
Die Zeit calls Morano the “most aggressive member of a well-paid mercenary group” who is “leading a fight that is fueled by hundreds of millions of dollars”. Zeit writes:
In the past years the fight was financed by US auto manufacturer Chrysler, and oil companies ExxonMobil and Chevron, and others. The story of the PR manager [Morano] is a story of a planned confusion. It is a didactic play on the art of lying. […] Doubt is now spreading across the world from America.”
And Morano is the mastermind behind it all, Die Zeit wants its readers to believe.
In Die Zeit’s view, there is no doubt that humans are causing the climate change, and that it will be catastrophic. The science and data are clear and the consensus is greater than ever. As far as Die Zeit is concerned, the scientific debate has long been over – a survey of 928 papers from 1993 to 2003 says so, they write. What’s left now is a struggle between the good warmists and the evil industry-paid deniers who are maliciously spreading doubt. There are no real skeptic climate scientists left. In the perception of Die Zeit, it’s now a struggle between David (honest climate scientists who are only doing their jobs) and Goliath (Morano leading an army of industry-funded PR mercenaries). Tragically, David is losing, Die Zeit frets.
Michael Mann proved climate change with his hockey stick
Die Zeit tells the story of “a little round man” named Michael Mann and his hockey stick chart, which they say is “proof that humans are at fault for climate change“. Die Zeit however blames Morano and the Heartland Institute for undermining the hockey stick’s credibility and fanning skepticism and lies. The hockey stick was attacked by Willie Soon who, Die Zeit explains, “received over 1 million dollars from ExxonMobil and other corporations“.
Unfortunately Die Zeit forgot to mention that the hockey stick had been debunked thoroughly by Steven McIntyre and Hans von Storch, who labelled the hockey stick chart “nonsense”, and that Andrew Montford wrote an entire book about the fraud: The Hockey Stick Illusion. They also failed to mention that the National Academy of Sciences had also called Mann’s methodology “flawed”.
They alluded to Wegman when describing a 2007 hearing:
A statistician, who up to then had nothing to do with climate science, described Mann as the mastermind of an international conspiracy, a former industry consultant who claimed Mann did not do his work properly.”

Die Zeit portrays Michael Mann as a humble and innocent scientist who today is being relentlessly tormented and persecuted by Morano and the skeptics just because his results are unpopular. While Morano lives “in a big Victorian home“, is chauffeured around in a limousine and “eats steak at the exquisite Capital Grill“, Mann lives in a humble little home, lit up by wind power, and is worried about his 7-year old daughter’s future. (There’s no mention he won a Nobel Peace Prize).
Die Zeit also focuses on Fred Singer and the late Frederick Seitz, who they write are “part of an industry-financed complex of associations and institutes that has grown up around Washington, a sort of Potemkin village of science, populated by paid experts who serve the interests of their clients. […] A well-oiled, self-perpetuating denial machine“.
Morano getting under Mann’s skin
Die Zeit describes the first time Michael Mann met Marc Morano, having no idea who he was. Today when Mann thinks back at this first encounter, “he has to take a deep breath. Now he’s knows who Marc Morano is.”
‘These people are cynics,’ he says. ‘It’s clear to me that Morano doesn’t mean me personally. He only wants to intimidate me. He wants to intimidate an entire field.’ Mann speaks softly, his face is pale.”
According to Mann, Morano has changed the entire rhetoric of the “deniers”. Mann says: “Morano has really accomplished a lot.”
Die Zeit writes that in the skeptics’ view:
The climate scientists are not only just wrong, but are now criminals who are intentionally committing fraud. Large parts of the public believe them.”
The Zeit also tells the story of how Mann once received a letter containing white powder, how he got a threatening e-mail, and that today “his life is no longer how it once was.” The underlying message Die Zeit conveys here is that climate scientists are being hounded, tormented and persecuted by a ruthless, industry funded mob.
Last resort for their beliefs
Die Zeit’s grotesquesly skewed perception of climate science skepticism includes a one-sided look at the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) and prominent German heavyweight skeptic Fritz Vahrenholt. I will write about that tomorrow.
I sent an e-mail to EIKE to get their opinion on DIE ZEIT’s perception of the skeptic movement. They replied, addressing the warmist movement in general:
They are in panic. Europe is the last resort for their beliefs.”
It’s important to remind readers that Die Zeit is a fundamentalist green publication that is completely closed to any arguments that challenge the global warming religion. It’s Kooksville.
For example, on February 6, 2012 at a press conference in Berlin, Dr Sebastian Lüning and Professor Fritz Vahrenholt unveiled their newly published book “Die kalte Sonne“. In attendance at the press conference was a journalist from Die Zeit, who, never having read the book, immediately attacked the two authors and their message. The good news that there was lots of science emerging showing no coming climate catastrophe was just too upsetting for him to handle. Just think about that.
The point here is that Die Zeit is just too fanatic and caught up in AGW dogmatism, and thus cannot be taken seriously as an objective source of any kind.

"The winning photographers, Aji Styawan and Greg Kahn, on opposite sides of the world, captured the stories of the impact of rising sea levels in Indonesia and the US and the resilience with which communities have responded.  Their local knowledge, individual photographic style and cultural sensitivity shone through to the grant judges. Both reveal restrained emotion and a surreal sense of place. The landscape, communities, political structures, religions and people these photographers work with are diverse. Their proposals and photography work impressed the jury and embraced the Climate Visuals seven principles for impactful photography. Indonesia is one of the largest archipelago nations in the world, with more than 17,000 islands. The majority of the small islands are only a metre above sea level. Deforestation, land reclamation and groundwater extraction make these areas even more vulnerable to rising sea levels. Experts predict that before 2050, thousands of small islands and millions of houses in coastal areas across Indonesia will disappear due to rising sea levels.  Demak is on the northern coast of Central Java, about 300 miles east of Jakarta. More than 500 households have been displaced in the past 20 years. As the sea levels rose, farmland became fish ponds and mangrove forests, which are now also submerged. Today it’s all sea. Three extra millimetres of water every year will make land vanish. It will swallow communities. It will change environmental habitats forever. It will cause record pollution. For townspeople along the inner coastal region of the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland, the impact of sea level rise is no longer an abstract worry debated by politicians. They see the land becoming more saturated beneath their feet. Thirteen of the bay’s southern islands, many of them once inhabited, are gone. 3 Millimeters explores the waterways of Maryland, where, due to the region’s makeup and Atlantic Ocean flow, sea levels are rising twice as fast as the global average and will leap by as much as 5ft by 2100. This will submerge more than 250,000 acres of land, displacing more than half a million people. Farms once fertile and productive now wilt as mounting salinity levels force families to abandon their way of life. There is nothing to stop Hoopers Island from slowly drowning. Locals point 100 yards into the bay, telling stories of a baseball field where they used to play. Graves containing the island founders, once buffered by a forest, now jut out from an eroding shoreline patched with makeshift rock walls. “I doubt there’ll be any human life here in 100 years,” said Donald Webster, who works for the Maryland Department of Natural Resources.  While nothing can reverse rising seas in places like Smith Island, there is hope for others. Gradient sea walls, vegetation renourishment and public education are all trying to preserve natural habitat and homes along the coast. The hope is that it will stop erosion as well as maintain habitat for sealife such as horseshoe crabs and terrapins. "

Chris Horner of the American Tradition Institute writes in with this:
So the American Association for the Advancement of Science, thoroughly rattled by the American Tradition Institute’s FOIA requests of UVa and NASA — and even more so by the litigation forced by the institutions’ respective stonewalling — issued a board statement comparing FOIA requests of climate scientists with death threats.  Really.
Naturally this caught the eye of the New York Times, which had a young lady contact us for comment. Right off the bat it was clear she, too, had been rattled by the horrors of our outrageous efforts to …see certain records the taxpayer has paid for and which are expressly covered by transparency laws.
Her stance was sympathetic to AAS’s to the point of temper.
She first reaffirmed a fancy for the apparently absolute truth that a FOIA request for climate scientists’ records is indeed no different than death threats allegedly made in Australia against scientists — sadly, if that’s true, they are now treated to what ‘skeptics’ have experienced for years, as I have detailed.
Well, actually, her disinterest in Greenpeace having created this little cottage practice indicated that this is true only for certain climate scientists’ records. Not the ones whose records Greenpeace is asking her for…that’s just transparency, good-government type stuff.
She continued by wondering, as such, do we condone death threats (really?) and, if not, why would we then also issue a FOIA?
Why that is particularly amusing, as opposed to sad, is that she was shocked by my assertion that Big Science/Big Academia’s objection to having laws that obviously cover their own actually applied to their own was of a part with Hollywood objecting to laws being applied to Roman Polanski. Apparently, by saying this, I was accusing Michael Mann of some heinous crime. Or something.
So see the below as I sent to her and, given the above, I expect you will not see in the story. Surely because it will be too busy explaining the tyranny of Greenpeace broadly filing similar requests. ATI’s statement is here.

Subject: AAAS release citing ATI transparency efforts
Dear Joanna,
I’m told you called ATI for comment. Below is my response per an earlier inquiry.
Best,
Christopher C. Horner Senior Fellow Competitive Enterprise Institute 1899 L St, NW 12th Floor Washington, DC, 20036 +1.202.331.2260 (O)
…
Several points:
I noticed no relation between our initiative and the Board’s rhetoric until they mentioned us somewhat incongruously.
The notion that application of laws expressly covering academics [is] an ‘attack’ on academics is substantively identical to Hollywood apologists calling application of other laws to Roman Polanski an attack on Polanski. They rather lost the plot somewhere along the way.
The failure to mention the group that invented this series of requests, Greenpeace, informs a conclusion that this attempt at outrage is selective, and therefore either feigned or hypocritical. This is also new; their problem is quite plainly with the law(s), but it is a problem they have, over the decades of transparency and ethics laws applying to scientists subsisting on taxpayer revenue, heretofore forgotten to mention.
Opposition to such laws applying to them is rather shocking. But then, maybe not so much when you also note their failure to comment on scientists being outed as advocating the flaunting of transparency laws.
Finally, AAUP’s code of professional ethics indicates that efforts to manipulate the peer review process are impermissible. Given the overlap and for other reasons we assume this is something AAAS agrees with or at minimum accepts. But this, too, is insincere if such behavior is permissible — or at least, where just cause indicates further inquiry is warranted, it is to be ignored — if the party at issue is one who for various reasons the AAAS or AAUP et al. elevate or find sympathetic. In Mann’s case, if our review of his documents which belong to the taxpayer also happen to exonerate him from the suspicions that have arisen, we will be the first to do so.

Statement from American Tradition Institute Environmental Law Center in Response to American Association for the Advancement of Science’s Misleading Accusations Against ATI Today


FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Wednesday, June 29, 2011
Contacts:
Christopher Horner, director of litigation, chris.horner@atinstitute.org
Paul Chesser, executive director, paul.chesser@atinstitute.org
======================================================================
Today the board of directors for the American Association for the Advancement of Science issued a statement and press release that denounced “personal attacks,” “harassment,” “death threats,” and “legal challenges” toward climate scientists. AAAS’s press release specifically cited actions taken by American Tradition Institute’s Environmental Law Center in its efforts to obtain records of Climategate scientist Dr. Michael Mann from the University of Virginia, and its efforts to obtain outside employment records of climate activist Dr. James Hansen from the National Aeronautical and Space Administration(NASA).
AAAS wrote, in part,
“we are concerned that establishing a practice of aggressive inquiry into the professional histories of scientists whose findings may bear on policy in ways that some find unpalatable could well have a chilling effect on the willingness of scientists to conduct research that intersects with policy-relevant scientific questions.”
Response to AAAS from ATI Environmental Law Center director of litigation Christopher Horner:
“I noticed no relation between our initiative and the AAAS Board’s rhetoric until they mentioned us somewhat incongruously.

“The notion that application of laws that expressly cover academics is an ‘attack’ on them is substantively identical to Hollywood apologists who call application of other laws to Roman Polanski an attack on Polanski. They lost the plot somewhere along the way.
“AAAS’s failure to mention the group that invented this series of requests, Greenpeace, informs our conclusion that this outrage is selective, and is therefore either feigned or hypocritical. Their problem is plainly with the laws, but it is a problem they have had over the decades: That transparency and ethics laws also apply to scientists who subsist on taxpayer revenue. This they also forgot to mention.
“Finally, the American Association of University Professors’ code of professional ethics indicates that efforts to manipulate the peer review process are impermissible. Given the overlap, and for other reasons, we assume AAAS agrees with these principles or at a minimum accepts them. But this, too, is insincere if such behavior is permitted or ignored where just cause indicates further inquiry is warranted, as long as the parties at issue are those whose views the AAAS or AAUP sympathize with. In Mann’s case, if our review of his documents which belong to the taxpayer also happen to exonerate him from the suspicions that have arisen, we will be the first to do so.”

================================================================
Reaction is now coming in. Alana Goodman of Commentray Magazine writes in a piece titled
Contentions – Climate Change Skepticism Now Considered ‘Harassment’?
…
Of course, what the AAAS calls “personal information” actually appears to be public data. The group’s statement comes on the heels of a lawsuit filed against NASA by the conservative American Traditional Institute earlier this month, which is trying to force the agency to release information about scientist James Hansen.
And after years of watching climate change advocates demonizing global warming skeptics, it’s hard to have any sympathy for the AAAS on this issue. Not to mention, previously leaked emails have shown climate change scientists behaving in ways abusive to the public trust. Skeptics should absolutely work to expose any potential corruption in the global warming advocacy community — and the fact AAAS is so terrified of legal challenges is good reason to believe these skeptics might be onto something.

Guest post by Ira Glickstein
A real greenhouse has windows. So does the Atmospheric “greenhouse effect”. They are similar in that they allow Sunlight in and restrict the outward flow of thermal energy. However, they differ in the mechanism. A real greenhouse primarily restricts heat escape by preventing convection while the “greenhouse effect” heats the Earth because “greenhouse gases” (GHG) absorb outgoing radiative energy and re-emit some of it back towards Earth.

The base graphic is from Wikipedia, with my annotations. There are two main “windows” in the Atmospheric “greenhouse effect”. The first, the Visible Light Window, on the left side of the graphic, allows visible and near-visible light from the Sun to pass through with small losses, and the second, the Longwave Window, on the right, allows the central portion of the longwave radiation band from the Earth to pass through with small losses, while absorbing and re-emitting the left and right portions.

The Visible Light Window
To understand how these Atmospheric windows work, we need to review some basics of so-called “blackbody” radiation. As indicated by the red curve in the graphic, the surface of the Sun is, in effect, at a temperature of 5525ºK (about 9500ºF), and therefore emits radiation with a wavelenth centered around 1/2μ (half a micron which is half a millionth of a meter). Solar light ranges from about 0.1μ to 3μ, covering the ultraviolet (UV), the visible, and the near-infrared (near-IR) bands. Most Sunlight is in the visible band from 0.38μ (which we see as violet) to 0.76μ (which we see as red), which is why our eyes evolved to be sensitive in that range. Sunlight is called “shortwave” radiation because it ranges from fractional microns to a few microns.
As the graphic indicates with the solid red area, about 70 to 75% of the downgoing Solar radiation gets through the Atmosphere, because much of the UV, and some of the visible and near-IR are blocked. (The graphic does not account for the portion of Sunlight that gets through the Atmosphere, and is then reflected back to Space by clouds and other high-albedo surfaces such as ice and white roofs. I will discuss and account for that later in this posting.)
My annotations represent the light that passes through the Visible Light Window as an orange ball with the designation 1/2μ, but please interpret that to include all the visible and near-visible light in the shortwave band.
The Longwave Window
As indicated by the pink, blue, and black curves in the graphic, the Earth is, in effect, at a temperature that ranges between a high of about 310ºK (about 98ºF) and a low of about 210ºK (about -82ºF). The reason for the range is that the temperature varies by season, by day or night, and by latitude. The portion of the Earth at about 310ºK radiates energy towards the Atmosphere at slightly shorter wavelengths than that at about 210ºK, but nearly all Earth-emitted radiation is between 5μ to 30μ, and is centered at about 10μ.
As the graphic indicates with the solid blue area, only 15% to 30% of the upgoing thermal radiation is transmitted through the Atmosphere, because nearly all the radiation in the left portion of the longwave band (from about 5μ to 8μ) and the right portion (from about 13μ to 30μ) is totally absorbed and scattered by GHG, primarily H2O (water vapor) and CO2 (carbon dioxide). Only the radiation near the center (from about 8μ to 13μ) gets a nearly free pass through the Atmosphere.
My annotations represent the thermal radiation from the Earth as a pink pentagon with the designation 7μ for the left-hand portion, a blue diamond 10μ for the center portion, and a dark blue hexagon 15μ for the right-hand portion, but please interpret these symbols to include all the radiation in their respective portions of the longwave band.
Sunlight Energy In = Thermal Energy Out
The graphic is an animated depiction of the Atmospheric “greenhouse effect” process.

On the left side:
(1) Sunlight streams through the Atmosphere towards the surface of the Earth.
(2) A portion of the Sunlight is reflected by clouds and other high-albedo surfaces and heads back through the Atmosphere towards Space. The remainder is absorbed by the Surface of the Earth, warming it.
(3) The reflected portion is lost to Space.
On the right side:
(1) The warmed Earth emits longwave radiation towards the Atmosphere. According to the first graphic, above, this consists of thermal energy in all bands ~7μ, ~10μ, and ~15μ.
(2) The ~10μ portion passes through the Atmosphere with litttle loss. The ~7μ portion gets absorbed, primarily by H2O, and the 15μ portion gets absorbed, primarily by CO2 and H2O. The absorbed radiation heats the H2O and CO2 molecules and, at their higher energy states, they collide with the other molecules that make up the air, mostly nitrogen (N2), oxygen (O2), ozone (O3), and argon (A) and heat them by something like conduction. The molecules in the heated air emit radiation in random directions at all bands (~7μ, ~10μ, and ~15μ). The ~10μ photons pass, nearly unimpeded, in whatever direction they happen to be emitted, some going towards Space and some towards Earth. The ~7μ and ~15μ photons go off in all directions until they run into an H2O or CO2 molecule, and repeat the absorption and re-emittance process, or until they emerge from the Atmosphere or hit the surface of the Earth.
(3) The ~10μ photons that got a free-pass from the Earth through the Atmosphere emerge and their energy is lost to Space. The ~10μ photons generated by the heating of the air emerge from the top of the Atmosphere and their energy is lost to Space, or they impact the surface of the Earth and are re-absorbed. The ~7μ and ~15μ generated by the heating of the air also emerge from the top or bottom of the Atmosphere, but there are fewer of them because they keep getting absorbed and re-emitted, each time with some transfered to the central ~10μ portion of the longwave band.
The symbols 1/2μ, 7μ, 10μ, and 15μ represent quanties of photon energy, averaged over the day and night and the seasons. Of course, Sunlight is available for only half the day and less of it falls on each square meter of surface near the poles than near the equator. Thermal radiation emitted by the Earth also varies by day and night, season, local cloud cover that blocks Sunlight, local albedo, and other factors. The graphic is designed to provide some insight into the Atmospheric “greenhouse effect”.
Conclusions
Even though estimates of climate sensitivity to doubling of CO2 are most likely way over-estimated by the official climate Team, it is a scientific truth that GHGs, mainly H2O but also CO2 and others, play an important role in warming the Earth via the Atmospheric “greenhouse effect”.
This and my previous posting in this series address ONLY the radiative exchange of energy. Other aspects that control the temperature range at the surface of the Earth are at least as important and they include convection (winds, storms, etc.) and precipitation that transfer a great deal of energy from the surface to the higher levels of the Atmosphere.
I plan to do a subsequent posting that looks into the violet and blue boxes in the above graphic and provides insight into the process the photons and molecules go through.
I am sure WUWT readers will find issues with my Atmospheric Windows description and graphics. I encourage each of you to make comments, all of which I will read, and some to which I will respond, most likely learning a great deal from you in the process. However, please consider that the main point of this posting, like the previous one in this series, is to give insight to those WUWT readers, who, like Einstein (and me :^) need a graphic visual before they understand and really accept any mathematical abstraction.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMDR television and radio here report of another solar energy catastrophe in Germany. Hat tip: Holger Thuss via Facebook.
It was a high tech center opened amid much media fanfare and ceremony back in April 2010, as the video below shows.

Fanfare and ceremony surrounded the opening of the now bankrupt “Center For Excellence” back in April 2010.
Numerous leading politicians, including national Research Minister Annette Schavan, were in attendance, and they all praised the “Center for Training and Excellence in the High Tech and Solar Industries” in Erfurt.
At the time, it was one of the latest prestige objects symbolizing the country’s ambition to become a global leader, and thus an example to the world, in renewable energy and environmental responsibility.
The facility was built at a cost of 10 million euros, 8 million of which came from the taxpayers. Today it stands bankrupt and empty. Insolvency liquidator Romy Metzger told German public television:
I no longer expect the assets will find a user for the way it was used formerly.”

German television adds that the building and inventory most likely will be separated. It simple laugauge: the project flopped. And now, according to MDR, an auction of the assets is no longer being ruled out. No interested investor could be found for the object as it was earlier.
The “center for excellence” included laboratories and clean rooms. Originally it was supposed to educate 2500 people every year for Germany’s planned mighty solar industry.
But over the last two years, almost every single one of Germany’s solar module and equipment manufacturers, most heavily subsidised by taxpayers, has closed in a wave of insolvencies not seen since East German industry collapsed in the wake of the fall of the Berlin Wall. It’s deja vu.
Germany’s entire solar industry has been transformed into a vast wasteland of false hopes and dashed dreams. MDR writes:
Demand never materialized and the solar expertise centre declared insolvency in June 2011.”

Since the Supreme Court’s 2010 decision in _Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission_ , proponents of stricter campaign finance regulation have increasingly prescribed “disclosure” as an antidote to “dark money” in politics. Advocates of more extensive donor disclosure laws typically invoke Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis’s famous maxim that “sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants,” but they seldom acknowledge the harm of excessive sunlight.



This paper urges a more critical and balanced look at the issue, especially concerning disclosure requirements for independent political speech (i.e., speech that is not coordinated with candidates). Of primary focus is the Court’s jurisprudence in this area, which is often invoked to support additional compulsory donor disclosure laws but lacks coherence, especially as it applies to independent speech. Even assuming that the Court’s jurisprudence in this area remains sound, many arguments being advanced for compulsory donor disclosure laws are untethered from the justifications the Court has articulated, rendering them especially susceptible to challenge in litigation. This paper concludes with recommendations on how, and how not, to enact disclosure laws.



Specifically, disclosure laws should be changed to make sure they allow citizens to keep tabs on public officials rather than enable officials to oversee citizens. Current disclosure thresholds should be raised significantly. Disclosure requirements for independent speech should be limited significantly, given that such mandates do not serve traditional justifications for disclosure.



Paraphrasing Martin Luther King Jr.’s immortal words, federal appellate court judge Janice Rogers Brown recently observed that “[t]he arc of campaign finance law has been ambivalent, bending toward speech and disclosure.” But these two values, she noted, “exist in unmistakable tension” with each other. 1 This paper will closely examine this tension between speech and disclosure in the context of compulsory donor disclosure requirements that apply to groups engaged in independent political speech activities. 2



Proponents of more disclosure requirements claim that such laws prevent corruption and the appearance of corruption, while providing the electorate with useful information about candidates and elected officials. Critics, meanwhile, maintain that such laws chill speech that provides equally important information to voters and infringe on the right to anonymous speech and associational privacy.



Laws requiring candidates, political parties, political action committees (commonly known as PACs), and other sponsors of political speech to publicly disclose their spending and donors have existed for decades 3 and even predate the modern‐​era regulatory scheme. 4 The drumbeat for more disclosure seems to have increased in recent years, however, as the Supreme Court has increasingly circumscribed the other ways in which political speech may be regulated. Beginning with the seminal 1976 _Buckley v. Valeo_ case, running through the landmark _Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission_ case in 2010, and continuing thereafter in the 2014 _McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission_ decision, the Court has invalidated key campaign finance provisions that restrict spending on and contributions to political campaigns. However, the Court generally has upheld disclosure requirements in some form. Thus, the regulatory fight naturally has narrowed to focus on disclosure.



Congressional opponents of _Citizens United_ wasted no time after the decision was issued to introduce a disclosure bill dubbed, with characteristic Washington kitsch, the “DISCLOSE Act” (Democracy Is Strengthened by Casting Light on Spending in Elections Act). 5 Having failed to pass it initially in the 111th Congress, its supporters have introduced variants of the bill in each of the four successive Congresses. 6 In the current Congress, a new disclosure bill also has been introduced called the “SUN Act” (Sunlight for Unaccountable Nonprofits Act), 7 which appears to have no better prospects at passage than its legislative cousin.



Seeing its legislative attempts at disclosure thwarted repeatedly in Congress, the campaign finance “reform” lobby also has turned to the White House and administrative state. It urged, to no avail, the Obama Administration to implement an executive order that requires government contractors to disclose their political contributions. 8 It also sent political spending disclosure rulemaking petitions to the Federal Communications Commission, 9 the Securities and Exchange Commission, 10 and Federal Election Commission (FEC), again to no avail. 11 At the state level, countless bills to counteract so‐​called dark money have been introduced. 12



A wealth of resources already details the long‐​standing tradition and value of anonymous speech in this country, 13 and one need only pay attention to the news to recognize the continuing relevance and importance of anonymous speech in society today. 14 Likewise, abundant literature documents the many harmful social consequences and instances of retribution against donors wrought by compulsory campaign finance disclosure law. 15 I can’t add much to the existing work on these respects.



Rather, this paper will draw on my perspective as a campaign finance attorney who regularly advises clients on federal and state campaign finance disclosure laws. Like many other practitioners, jurists, and scholars who have grappled with this issue, my experience has led me to conclude that the Court’s rulings protecting anonymous speech and First Amendment associational privacy rights on the one hand, and compulsory donor disclosure laws on the other, are impossible to reconcile when applied to organizations operating independently of candidates. The jurisprudence in this area has failed to convincingly demonstrate that the purported societal interest in disclosure outweighs donors’ and speakers’ speech and privacy interests, and the justifications for disclosure also rest on questionable assumptions. What’s more, even if we assume for argument’s sake that the Court’s jurisprudence in this area is sound, many arguments being advanced for disclosure laws have no jurisprudential support and may wither under the light of scrutiny.



“Disclosure” is a term with warm and fuzzy connotations. When someone intersperses a “full disclosure” disclaimer in a conversation, we tend to credit the speaker for his or her candor. But privacy also is commonly regarded as a virtue in its own right. The right to privacy is held to be “fundamental” against intrusions by the government, 16 and laws also have proliferated over the years to protect our medical, 17 educational, 18 financial, 19 and online 20 privacy against intrusions by private actors.



These competing interests of privacy and anonymity versus disclosure in the context of political speech are reflected in the Court’s tortured and tortuous jurisprudence.



Jurisprudential Justifications for Donor Privacy. Although the notion of a right to associational privacy certainly preexisted the civil rights movement, the 1958 Supreme Court case _NAACP v. Alabama_ is as good a starting point as any for illustrating the compelling rationale for donor privacy. 21 In that case, state officials seeking to block the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) from operating in Alabama subpoenaed the names and addresses of the group’s members in the state. 22 Although the case did not primarily revolve around the group’s donor list, 23 the Court later would apply the _NAACP_ holding specifically in the context of campaign finance donor disclosure laws. 24



In blocking Alabama’s subpoena of the NAACP’s membership list, the Court noted that “[e]ffective advocacy of both public and private points of view, particularly controversial ones, is undeniably enhanced by group association” under the First Amendment, and “compelled disclosure of affiliation with groups engaged in advocacy may constitute … a restraint on freedom of association.” 25 “[P]rivacy in group association,” the Court reasoned, “may in many circumstances be indispensable to preservation of freedom of association, particularly where a group espouses dissident beliefs.” 26 Moreover, this constitutional protection of associational privacy does not diminish when the resulting reprisals come from “private community pressures” rather than government (though such reprisals often do come from government), “for it is only after the initial exertion of state power [in forcing disclosure] that private action takes hold.” 27



In 1960, in a case involving handbills urging a civil rights boycott, the Court struck down a Los Angeles city ordinance that required such materials to contain a disclaimer disclosing the names of their printers and those “who caused the same to be distributed”—including the identities of “owners, managers, or agents” in the case of organizational sponsors. 28 The Court stated plainly that “[t]here can be no doubt that such an identification requirement would tend to restrict freedom to distribute information and thereby freedom of expression.” 29 The Court recognized that “[p]ersecuted groups and sects from time to time throughout history have been able to criticize oppressive practices and laws either anonymously or not at all,” and that speaker “identification [requirements] and fear of reprisal might deter perfectly peaceful discussions of public matters of importance.” 30



During the post‐​Watergate era, the Court began subordinating its strong protection for anonymous speech to the government’s purported interest in the disclosure of political spending. Nonetheless, in the seminal 1976 case _Buckley v. Valeo_ , which upheld the constitutionality of certain aspects of the post‐​Watergate campaign finance disclosure scheme, the Court continued to maintain that “compelled disclosure, in itself, can seriously infringe on privacy of association and belief guaranteed by the First Amendment.” 31 Specifically addressing the issue of donor disclosure, the Court noted the following:



The right to join together for the advancement of beliefs and ideas is diluted if it does not include the right to pool money through contributions, for funds are often essential if advocacy is to be truly or optimally effective. Moreover, the invasion of privacy of belief may be as great when the information sought concerns the giving and spending of money as when it concerns the joining of organizations, for financial transactions can reveal much about a person’s activities, associations, and beliefs. 32



The Court further acknowledged that disclosure “will deter some individuals who otherwise might contribute. In some instances, disclosure may even expose contributors to harassment or retaliation. These are not insignificant burdens on individual rights… .” 33 In light of these concerns, _Buckley_ “narrowly limited” the disclosure requirements at issue in the case to apply only to “organizations that are under the control of a candidate or the major purpose of which is the nomination or election of a candidate,” as well as “spending that is unambiguously campaign related.” 34



Even after _Buckley_ upheld the principle that _some_ campaign finance disclosure laws could be constitutional, the right to anonymous political speech maintained an important place in the Court’s jurisprudence. In the 1995 case _McIntyre v. Ohio Elections_ Commission, the Court again addressed whether “the First Amendment’s protection of anonymity encompasses documents intended to influence the electoral process.” 35 Specifically, the case arose out of a concerned citizen’s printing, financing, and distribution of flyers opposing a local school tax referendum. Some of those flyers did not comply with an Ohio law requiring disclaimers identifying the sponsor of any materials “designed to promote the nomination or election or defeat of a candidate, or to influence the voters in any election, or [to] make an expenditure for the purpose of financing political communications.” 36



In holding the Ohio law unconstitutional, the Court noted that “an author’s decision to remain anonymous, like other decisions concerning omissions or additions to the content of a publication, is an aspect of the freedom of speech protected by the First Amendment.” 37 In addition to protecting against the “threat of persecution, an advocate may believe her ideas will be more persuasive if her readers are unaware of her identity. Anonymity thereby provides a way for a writer who may be personally unpopular to ensure that readers will not prejudge her message simply because they do not like its proponent. Thus, even in the field of political rhetoric … the most effective advocates have sometimes opted for anonymity.” 38 The Court compared anonymous political speech to “the secret ballot, the hard‐​won right to vote one’s conscience without fear of retaliation.” 39



Jurisprudential Justifications for Compulsory Donor Disclosure. Even as the Supreme Court’s _Buckley_ decision acknowledged the right to associational and donor privacy, the decision nonetheless found that “there are governmental interests [in disclosure] sufficiently important to outweigh” this right:



First, disclosure provides the electorate with information as to where political campaign money comes from and how it is spent by the candidate in order to aid the voters in evaluating those who seek federal office. It allows voters to place each candidate in the political spectrum more precisely than is often possible solely on the basis of party labels and campaign speeches. The sources of a candidate’s financial support also alert the voter to the interests to which a candidate is most likely to be responsive and thus facilitate predictions of future performance in office.  
  
Second, disclosure requirements deter actual corruption and avoid the appearance of corruption by exposing large contributions and expenditures to the light of publicity. This exposure may discourage those who would use money for improper purposes either before or after the election. A public armed with information about a candidate’s most generous supporters is better able to detect any post‐​election special favors that may be given in return. 40



For sponsors of independent expenditures—that is, political advertising expressly advocating the election or defeat of candidates that is not coordinated with any candidates—the Court acknowledged that “[t]he corruption potential of these expenditures may be significantly different.” 41 Thus, “if the only purpose of [independent spending disclosure requirements] were to stem corruption or its appearance,” such a justification “might have been fatal” to the law’s constitutionality. 42 Nonetheless, the Court held that the “informational interest” in disclosure was sufficient justification, because “disclosure helps voters to define more of the candidates’ constituencies.” 43



In short, after interpreting the law to cut back the scope of disclosure, the Court in _Buckley_ found that the remaining disclosure requirements contained in the Federal Election Campaign Act survived the “exacting scrutiny” standard for judicial review of disclosure laws, which are presumed to impose “significant encroachments on First Amendment rights.” 44 Under this balancing of interests, there must be a “substantial relation between the governmental interest and the information required to be disclosed.” 45



The Court has continued to rely on Buckley’s framework and justifications in subsequent cases involving challenges to campaign finance disclosure laws. In McConnell _v. Federal Election Commission_ , the Court upheld the 2002 Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act’s (BCRA) requirement that sponsors of so-called “electioneering communications” identify themselves in disclaimers and disclose their spending and information about certain donors on campaign finance reports. “[T]he important state interests that prompted the _Buckley_ Court to uphold [the Federal Election Campaign Act’s] disclosure requirements—providing the electorate with information, deterring actual corruption and avoiding any appearance thereof, and gathering the data necessary to enforce more substantive electioneering restrictions—apply in full to BCRA,” the Court held. 46



In _Citizens United_ , a plurality of the Court rebuffed a request by the eponymous group to exempt its commercial advertisements, which had urged viewers in 2008 to watch its documentary on then-candidate Hillary Clinton, from BCRA’s electioneering communication disclaimer and disclosure requirements. 47 “Even if the ads only pertain to a commercial transaction, the public has an interest in knowing who is speaking about a candidate shortly before an election. Because the informational interest alone is sufficient to justify application of [BCRA’s disclosure requirements] to these ads, it is not necessary to consider the Government’s other asserted interests,” the plurality opinion held. 48



Cracks in the Disclosure Jurisprudence. Proponents of expanding donor disclosure requirements for groups engaged in independent political speech rely on the Supreme Court’s disclosure rulings to validate their position. For example, even though Democracy 21 president Fred Wertheimer has lambasted _Citizens United_ as “one of the worst and most damaging decisions in the court’s history,” 49 he has lauded the decision for “affirm[ing] more than three decades of prior Court decisions in making clear that disclosure of money spent ... for campaign-related expenditures is constitutional.” 50 Former FEC commissioner Ann Ravel has called for “the mistaken jurisprudence of _Citizens United_ [to be] reexamined,” 51 even as she has praised the decision’s “rul[ing] that unlimited corporate independent political spending must be accompanied by transparency as to the sources of such spending.” 52



The Court’s disclosure jurisprudence is hardly a model of coherence, however, and proponents of disclosure should be wary of putting too much stock in it. Setting aside the doctrinal inconsistencies, there is also reason to question some of the Court’s assumptions about the purported governmental interests in disclosure.



As Judge Janice Rogers Brown has noted, “Both an individual’s right to speak anonymously and the public’s interest in contribution disclosures are now firmly entrenched in the Supreme Court’s First Amendment jurisprudence. And yet they are also fiercely antagonistic.” 53 Even more problematic is how the jurisprudence “treats speech, a constitutional right, and transparency, an extra-constitutional value, as equivalents.” 54 This latter point warrants some additional examination.



First, recall that it is not enough under the Court’s jurisprudence merely for the government to have a legitimate interest in requiring disclosure of political spending. Rather, the interest must be “sufficiently important to _outweigh_ ” the constitutional right to anonymous speech. 55



The disclosure debate today primarily revolves around requiring the reporting of funding sources for speech that is made independently of any candidates and political parties 56 (and, in some cases, speech that is not even related to any political campaigns). 57 For such independent speech, the only justification for disclosure the Court has articulated that remains viable and relevant is the “informational interest” in enabling the public to know who is funding political speech. 58 The anti-corruption rationale for disclosure mentioned in the _McConnell_ decision 59 no longer applies as a matter of law, as _Citizens United_ held that independent speech “do[es] not lead to, or create the appearance of, _quid pro quo_ corruption”—which is the only type of corruption relevant here. 60 Indeed, as noted previously, the informational interest is the only interest _Citizens United_ addressed in upholding disclosure requirements for independent speech, 61 and even the 1976 _Buckley_ decision suggested this was the primary justification for this type of disclosure requirement. 62



Admittedly, that anonymity and associational privacy in the exercise of speech have been held to be a constitutional right, while disclosure is merely an “extra-constitutional value,” does not automatically weigh in favor of the former. It is generally accepted that “First Amendment rights are not absolute under all circumstances. They may be circumscribed when necessary to further a sufficiently strong public interest.” 63 Nonetheless, it is difficult to conclude definitively that the informational interests the Court has endorsed for compulsory donor disclosure concerning independent political speech are “sufficiently important to _outweigh_ ” (in the formulation of _Buckley_ ) the reasons the Court has articulated for protecting the right to anonymous speech and associational privacy under the First Amendment. This is best illustrated simply by presenting these justifications side by side (see box on page 7).64



Even construing these arguments in the light most favorable to disclosure’s proponents, it is difficult to say objectively or conclusively that the justifications for compulsory disclosure outweigh the justifications for donor privacy and anonymous speech. As Judge Janice Rogers Brown put it, these competing interests appear, at best, to be “equivalent.” 65 Per the balancing test _Buckley_ articulated (although not as Buckley applied it), this should not be a sufficient basis to infringe on First Amendment rights, particularly where the “core political speech” that is being burdened falls squarely within “an area in which the importance of First Amendment protections is at its zenith.” 66 As federal appellate judge Frank Easterbrook has noted, rather than engaging in a serious application of the “Constitution to constrain contemporary legislation supported by the social class from which judges are drawn,” the Court’s jurisprudence in this area is tantamount to acting as a “council of revision” in “say[ing] that a law is valid to the extent that it is good ... [a]nd when, as in _McConnell_ , the judgment is supported by a one-vote margin, any Justice’s conclusion that a particular extension is unwise will reverse the constitutional outcome.” 67



Justifications for anonymous speech/associational privacy



Justifications for disclosure of sources of independent political speech



Not only is the Court’s general balancing of the competing interests in favor of disclosure questionable, but the specific reasoning and results of its decisions upholding disclosure also are difficult to reconcile with its decisions coming down on the side of anonymity. Of the _McConnell_ decision, Judge Easterbrook has noted “the Justices’ failure to discuss _McIntyre_ , or even to cite _Talley_ ” and other decisions protecting anonymous speech. 68 The Buckley, _McConnell_ , and _Citizens United_ decisions in favor of compulsory disclosure are particularly difficult to reconcile with the _McIntyre_ decision in favor of anonymous speech, as well as with other notable decisions, such as _Bates v. Little Rock_ 69 and _Pollard v. Roberts_ , 70 upholding the right to donor and associational privacy.



Attempts to distinguish the holding of _McIntyre_ (including within the _McIntyre_ decision itself) from other precedents upholding compulsory donor disclosure laws also are unpersuasive. First, _McIntyre_ attempts to draw a distinction between the disclosure related to speech about ballot measures at issue in that case and the disclosure related to speech about candidates at issue in _Buckley_. Although “avoiding the appearance of corruption” justifies disclosure of campaign spending on candidates, the _McIntyre_ decision explained that this concern is irrelevant to ballot measures because ballot measures cannot be corrupted. 71



However, as discussed previously, the anti-corruption rationale is not a relevant basis for distinguishing between disclosure requirements for candidate-related speech and ballot measure–related speech because this rationale—according to _Buckley_ and Citizens _United_ —is insufficient to uphold disclosure requirements for independent speech generally. 72



At the same time, _Buckley_ also upheld disclosure on the basis of its informational or heuristic value—that is, “allow[ing] voters to place each candidate in the political spectrum more precisely.” 73 That same rationale is used to justify requiring disclosure of the identities of speakers about ballot measures and their sources of funding. For example, former FEC commissioner Ann Ravel, who was also a former member of the California Fair Political Practices Commission, has explained that California requires disclosure of donors to groups advocating for or against ballot measures “so that voters can make informed choices at the ballot box.” 74



The _McIntyre_ decision flatly rejected this informational interest for being insufficiently important, however, and it did so in a way that was not limited to speech about ballot measures. Specifically, _McIntyre_ held that “the simple interest in providing voters with additional relevant information does not justify a state requirement that a writer make statements or disclosures she would otherwise omit.” 75 If requiring “additional relevant information” about speakers is insufficient to justify compulsory disclosure in the context of speech about ballot measures, then logically it should also be insufficient to justify compulsory disclosure in the context of independent speech about candidates. And yet the latter was upheld in _Buckley_ , McConnell, and _Citizens United_. 76



The _McIntyre_ decision also attempted to limit its holding by drawing a distinction between the sponsorship identification disclaimer requirement specifically at issue in that case and the financial reporting requirements at issue in other campaign finance disclosure cases. 77 Lower courts attempting to grapple with _McIntyre_ also have pointed to this distinction. 78 According to _McIntyre_ , financial reporting requirements are less objectionable because “even though money may ‘talk,’ its speech is less specific, less personal, and less provocative than a handbill—and as a result, when money supports an unpopular viewpoint it is less likely to precipitate retaliation.” 79 On the other hand, “A written election-related document—particularly a leaflet—is often a personally crafted statement of a political viewpoint... . As such, identification of the author [in a disclaimer requirement] against her will is particularly intrusive; it reveals unmistakably the content of her thoughts on a controversial issue.” 80



This attempt to limit _McIntyre’_ s holding also is unavailing. In my extensive experience advising clients on campaign finance disclaimer and donor reporting requirements, no organization that engages in political speech would ever regard a sponsorship identification disclaimer requirement as being more intrusive or burdensome than a requirement to report the organization’s donors. It is also not true, as _McIntyre_ claimed, that disclosure of donor information is “less likely to precipitate retaliation.” In practice, opponents of organizations’ political positions typically retaliate against the organizations’ publicly disclosed donors with as much (or greater) zeal as they do against the organizations themselves. 81 Moreover, this risk of retaliation against donors has only increased since _McIntyre_ was decided in 1995, as the Internet has greatly facilitated retrieving disclosure reports and donors’ personal information. 82



And even if the _McIntyre_ ruling is read narrowly to apply only to the enforcement of disclaimer requirements against _individuals_ , 83 the rationale it articulated for the right to privacy when exercising the right to free speech should apply no less to compulsory donor disclosure requirements for _groups_ of individuals. To wit, if an individual speaker has a right to choose whether she wishes to be publicly associated with “provocative” or “controversial” speech that is “likely to precipitate retaliation,” that right also should apply to individuals who choose to speak collectively through an association. Indeed, as discussed previously, the _Buckley_ decision articulated concern about the burdens on “individual rights” imposed by laws requiring disclosure of their contributions to organizations. 84



To the extent anyone may suggest that the disclaimer requirements at issue in _McIntyre_ are not “disclosure” requirements at all, 85 such a position also is untenable. The Supreme Court has described disclaimer requirements as part of a “disclosure regime,” 86 and advocates of compulsory disclosure laws agree. 87



The assumptions baked into the Court’s disclosure jurisprudence are at least as tenuous as its internal logic, or lack thereof. The “informational interest” theory the Court has endorsed rests on two basic interrelated premises: (1) that information about the sources of financial support for candidates or ballot measures is generally salient to voters, and (2) that voters will be able to draw a meaningful connection between that information and the candidates or issues they are voting on. Empirical research and real-world experiences call both premises into question.



It is important to note at the outset the apparent paucity of empirical data showing that voters use donor disclosure information to inform their votes. Writing in 2007, Professor Ray La Raja of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst noted, “There have been no empirical studies ... about the effect of disclosure on important political outcomes such as voter knowledge and trust. Indeed, we have a weak understanding about the mechanism through which voters learn about money in politics.” 88 Ten years later, that still appears to be the case, and what little research there is undercuts the case for disclosure.



This lack of evidence for compulsory disclosure should be fatal under the “exacting scrutiny” standard of judicial review held to apply to disclosure laws, under which the government typically is required to justify any impositions it places on speech. 89 Relatedly, in other campaign finance law contexts, the Court has warned that it has “never accepted mere conjecture [in defense of a speech restriction] as adequate to carry a First Amendment burden.” 90 However, as discussed previously, when it comes to campaign finance _disclosure_ laws, the Court tends to put its thumb on the scales in favor of compulsory disclosure—including its acceptance of the conjectural “informational interest” to justify such laws.



As the Court noted in _McIntyre_ , “in the case of a handbill written by a private citizen who is not known to the recipient, the name and address of the author add little, if anything, to the reader’s ability to evaluate the document’s message.” 91 This point is likely true of disclosure of campaign donor information generally: although certain donors may be recognizable to a small minority of the public (including a subset that is prone to using disclosure information to harass and retaliate against donors), for most Americans, disclosure information is probably meaningless.



For example, a 2014 poll found that more than half of Americans didn’t know who the Koch brothers were, 92 even though Charles and David Koch have been two of the country’s best-known political donors for at least the past decade or two. And this poll was taken _after_ Democratic Party leaders had undertaken a highly public and concerted effort to demonize the Koch brothers for their political giving and to hold them up as foils to the Democrats’ agenda. 93 Other relatively prominent donors across the political spectrum, such as George Soros, Tom Steyer, or Sheldon Adelson, likely enjoy comparable obscurity among the general public. If the donors disclosed under campaign finance laws are unknown to most of the public, this certainly calls into question the heuristic value or “informational interest” these laws are purported to advance.



Not only do average voters seem not to know who most political donors are, but they also don’t seem to care, even when this information is filtered through the news media, and notwithstanding the purported strong public support for disclosure laws in the abstract. 94 In 2011, Professor David Primo of the University of Rochester presented Florida voters with a hypothetical ballot measure based on an actual Colorado ballot measure, as well as 15 sources of information about the ballot measure comprising newspaper articles and editorials, a voter guide, and campaign ads. The study found that the two newspaper articles containing campaign finance disclosure information related to the ballot measure were the least viewed, and of those two articles, the one whose headline clearly indicated a story about campaign finance information drew the least interest. 95 On this basis, Primo concluded that “campaign finance information, in particular, is not of much interest to respondents.” 96



Moreover, the voters who chose to read the articles containing campaign finance disclosure information also read three times more articles in total than those who ignored the campaign finance articles. 97 Primo interpreted this as “suggesting that voters who access campaign finance information are the least likely to need it to make informed choices.” 98 Put another way, this finding corroborates Judge Easterbrook’s observation (discussed earlier) that the campaign finance disclosure jurisprudence reflects a bias of the “social class from which judges are drawn.” 99 To wit, those who are the most informed about political issues are the ones who find campaign finance disclosure information to be the most meaningful, while most Americans appear to be indifferent to such information.



Primo’s study is consistent with La Raja’s earlier study, in which La Raja analyzed newspaper articles about state politics in states with campaign finance laws of varying robustness. La Raja found only a “slight” increase in the number of articles about campaign finance in states with “good disclosure regimes.” La Raja attributed this finding to the “inelastic” public demand for articles containing campaign finance information, and thus newspapers’ reluctance to provide more coverage on the issue. 100



Moreover, many of the newspaper articles La Raja analyzed only provided superficial “horserace” coverage of where candidates stood relative to each other in terms of their campaign funds, or focused on discussions of general “campaign finance policy” 101—not the type of heuristic information that the Buckley __court postulated would “allow[] voters to place each candidate in the political spectrum more precisely” or “alert the voter to the interests to which a candidate is most likely to be responsive and thus facilitate predictions of future performance in office.” 102



Both the Primo and LaRaja studies are consistent with a self-assessment the National Institute on Money in State Politics (NIMSP) commissioned the RAND Corporation to perform in 2014. 103 As NIMSP’s report pointed out, the Court’s _McCutcheon_ decision cited NIMSP’s website, FollowTheMoney.org, as an example of the “massive quantities of information [that] can be accessed at the click of a mouse,” thus making “disclosure[] effective to a degree not possible at the time _Buckley_ , or even _McConnell_ , was decided.” 104 However, the NIMSP report cited almost no examples of how its donor disclosure data, which it compiles from state records, is actually used in a way that advances the heuristic theory postulated in _Buckley_ of “aid[ing] the voters in evaluating those who seek [public] office.”



Conceding that “the actual impact” of donor disclosure data on the general public likely “is rather low,” the NIMSP report begins by arguing that the “value” of donor disclosure data “can ... be found in the writings of [Supreme Court Justice Louis] Brandeis; the past opinions of the Supreme Court; and in the public campaigns toward greater electoral transparency, as evinced by the creation and operations of the [Federal Election Commission].” 105 This places the cart before the horse, though. Legal regimes requiring disclosure are not, in and of themselves, evidence of the efficacy of disclosure; rather, empirical evidence should be required to justify the existence of such legal regimes.



The NIMSP report then goes on to provide a vague account of how journalists use disclosure data, and little can be concluded from this section of the report about the social value of disclosure. 106 The report’s discussion of how advocacy groups use the disclosure data is quite telling, however. With the exception of one group that purported to use disclosure data to draw a link between campaign funding and elected officials’ positions on criminal justice reform, all other advocacy groups cited appeared to use the disclosure information to advocate on campaign finance disclosure policy, and the list of groups themselves is a who’s who of campaign finance policy lobbying outfits ranging from Americans for Campaign Reform to Transparency International. 107 In short, the NIMSP report suggests that donor disclosure data is being used primarily as the main ingredient in a “self-licking ice cream cone” 108 to advocate for more disclosure, rather than to provide meaningful information to voters.



Real-world examples also suggest that campaign donor information often does not accurately “predict[] future performance in office.” During the 2013 federal government shutdown, the _New York Times_ and the Washington _Post_ both ran articles remarking on how business interests, which had financially supported Republicans and opposed the shutdown, had been “spurned” by or had “los[t] sway” over congressional Republicans who backed the shutdown. 109 Perhaps if the “social class” that finds campaign finance donor disclosure so alluring had focused more on the substance of what certain congressional members and candidates had actually campaigned on, rather than who their financial supporters were, the result would have made more sense to the _Times_ and _Post_.



Another example of the lack of correlation between the sources of candidates’ financial support and their policy positions is the controversy over the Target Corporation’s 2010 contribution to a Minnesota state super PAC that supported gubernatorial candidate Tom Emmer. 110 Although Target maintained that the contribution was made to support the super PAC’s economic policy positions, the disclosure of the retailer’s contribution was met with a wave of protests and a petition signed by more than 240,000 individuals threatening to boycott Target because of Emmer’s opposition to same-sex marriage. 111 (Hypocritically, the protest was orchestrated by MoveOn.org, an organization comprised in large part of a 501(c)(4) “dark money” arm that is not required to disclose its own donors. 112)



In fact, Target had a strong record of supporting gay rights 113 and likely did not support Emmer’s position on the issue. Had the disclosure of Target’s political contribution worked the way the Court’s jurisprudence postulated, one would have drawn the wrong conclusion about Emmer’s position on same-sex marriage based on Target’s position on the issue. However, no protesters opposing Target’s contribution likely were laboring under the Court’s misimpression that the disclosure of this information had any heuristic value in determining the candidate’s position on social issues. In fact, the protesters were using disclosure for the opposite purpose: to pressure _the contributor_ to distance itself _from the candidate based on positions of the candidate already known to the protestors_. Regardless of whether one believes this is a legitimate or socially valuable use of disclosure data, it is important to recognize that this is a use of disclosure that is far afield from the justifications the Court has endorsed for compulsory disclosure.



If one goes in search of better justifications for compulsory donor disclosure beyond the Supreme Court’s holdings, the landscape is still rather bleak. The arguments put forward for disclosure often are illogical on their face, contrary to actual experience, inconsistent with other First Amendment precepts, or downright invidious.



For example, former state senator Larry Martin (R-SC), who had been the subject of advertisements criticizing his legislative record during his failed primary bid for reelection, recently explained his support for compulsory disclosure as follows: “They’re able to put a spin on things that you can’t really refute because you don’t know who they are.” 114



U.S. Senator Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND) makes a similar case for disclosure: “When it’s clear who’s behind an ad ... [w]e can take the sales pitch with a grain of salt, and make an informed decision about whether or not to buy it. The same is true with political ads—to understand them, we need to know who’s behind them.” 115



But readers of the pseudonymous Federalist _Papers_ seemed to have no trouble understanding the arguments presented therein without knowing who “Publius” was. 116 And Anti-Federalists writing as “Cato,” “Centinel,” “The Federal Farmer,” and “Brutus” also apparently faced no impediment in rebutting “Publius” without knowing the latter’s identity. 117 If these examples come across as antiquated, consider the ubiquity of anonymous sources in news reporting in the modern age. Notwithstanding that “Deep Throat’s” identity remained secret for more than 30 years after the Watergate scandal, no one ever claimed an inability to understand the substance of his allegations, which helped bring down a president. 118



Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) made a somewhat more cogent and perhaps more candid—although no more persuasive—argument for disclosure in his (unsuccessful) lawsuit challenging what he alleged to be the FEC’s insufficient disclosure regulations for so-called electioneering communications. Because, according to Van Hollen, the FEC’s rules permit sponsors of such ads to be funded by “anonymous donors,” he claimed injury because he would “not be able to respond by, _inter alia_ , drawing to the attention of the voters in his district the identity of persons whose donations are used to fund” such ads. 119



In other words, unlike his colleague Senator Heitkamp and former state senator Martin, Senator Van Hollen (wisely) did not make the fanciful claim that he would literally be unable to respond to substantive criticism of his public record without knowing the sources of funding for such speech. Rather, what Van Hollen appears to have meant is that he could not refute his critics’ speech by resorting to responses about “the[ir] identity.” For those yearning for more substantive debates in our politics, this argument for ad hominem attacks is hardly a ringing endorsement for compulsory disclosure. Under the framework of our First Amendment jurisprudence, this justification would require a finding that there is a legitimate governmental interest in facilitating the logical fallacy of the argumentum ad hominem. 120



Senator Heitkamp also claimed that “undisclosed money ... makes our democratic process nastier and more divisive.” 121 Likewise, Connecticut state representative Livvy Floren has pointed to a laundry list of “dirty politics and divisiveness, bombast and blasphemy, lies and libel, negativity and nastiness, anger and animosity—all paid for with millions of dollars from anonymous donors” as justification for more compulsory donor disclosure laws. 122 As a counterpoint to this, Professor Charles Kesler of Claremont McKenna College has called the pseudonymously written Federalist Papers a “model of candor, civility, and deliberation for future American political disputes.” 123 And it is not as if candidates have any trouble coarsening the political debate entirely on their own without any anonymous outside help. 124 Moreover, if anything has made our politics “nastier and more divisive,” certainly compulsory disclosure laws are partially responsible, as evidenced by those instances discussed earlier of donors being threatened and harassed as a result of their political contributions having been disclosed. 125



West Virginia state senator Mike Romano has argued for passing a state campaign finance disclosure bill on the grounds that “[p]eople have a harder time lying when they can’t hide behind their checkbooks.” 126 However, speech laws that seek to root out false speech are generally frowned upon as a form of content-based speech regulation, and the Court has endorsed “the common understanding that some false statements are inevitable if there is to be an open and vigorous expression of views in public and private conversation,” as well as the notion that “[t]he remedy for speech that is false is speech that is true.” 127 But this may not matter much; as demonstrated previously, the jurisprudence on campaign finance disclosure laws does not appear to be particularly concerned about consistency with other areas of First Amendment law.



Every so often, compulsory disclosure supporters reveal their true intention of deterring speech. In introducing the DISCLOSE Act in 2010, Sen. Chuck Schumer warned that the bill’s “deterrent effect should not be underestimated.” 128 And just to be clear that Senator Schumer was not quoted out of context, when confronted with his quote in 2014, he not only didn’t disavow it, but he doubled down and reiterated his belief that “when somebody is trying to influence government for their purposes, directly with ads and everything else [in other words, engage in political speech], it’s good to have a deterrent effect.” 129 Senator Heitkamp, somewhat more circumspect than her colleague, has argued that “there’s too much money in politics” (in other words, too much spending on political speech) as a reason for cosponsoring the SUN Act disclosure legislation, which is presumably designed to reduce the amount of speech. 130



This sometimes not-so-subtle effort to use compulsory donor disclosure laws to limit speech runs head-on, however, into what the Court has long held to be our “profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open, and that it may well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials.” 131 Not only that, but the deterrence of speech diminishes the public’s “right to hear, to learn, to know” 132—a right that also has been held to be fundamental. 133



Moreover, as the Court recognized in _McIntyre_ , compulsory disclosure laws tend to “place[] a more significant burden on advocates of unpopular causes than on defenders of the status quo.” 134 Thus, the deterrent effect that Senator Schumer touts also functions as a de facto content regulation of speech. 135 As Justice Scalia noted in the _McConnell_ case, “[T]his is an area in which evenhandedness is not fairness... . _any_ restriction upon a type of campaign speech that is equally available to challengers and incumbents tends to favor incumbents.” 136 Certainly, Justice Scalia was writing in _McConnell_ about a categorical prohibition of certain “electioneering” speech, and he was elsewhere a full-throated supporter of campaign finance disclosure laws. 137 However, to the extent that the Court has recognized the significant burden disclosure requirements impose on political speech, Scalia’s suspicions about an incumbency protection scheme should apply equally against disclosure laws that all too often are touted by incumbents (as evidenced by the comments of the various federal and state legislators discussed earlier).



Even if these miscellaneous justifications for disclosure were remotely cogent or persuasive, none of these rationales fits within the “informational interest” in helping “voters to place each candidate in the political spectrum” that the Court has endorsed in upholding disclosure laws. Thus, if legislators are designing disclosure laws to further one of these other interests, they should not count on those laws being upheld in litigation.



Nor do these justifications fit within the anti-corruption rationale for disclosure that the Court has endorsed for disclosure of contributions to candidates, and which I have argued no longer justifies disclosure requirements for independent speech in light of recent jurisprudence. However, to the extent advocates of disclosure continue to press the anti-corruption rationale even for disclosure related to independent speech, this point merits a brief response. 138



To reiterate: Under the “exacting scrutiny” standard for judicial review of disclosure laws, the government bears the burden of demonstrating that disclosure of the funding sources of independent political speech helps prevent corruption. 139 Not only does it not appear that the government has met this burden, but it also seems that disclosure could just as easily have the opposite effect. As Judge Easterbrook has observed, disclosure laws “make[] it easier to see who has not done his bit for the incumbents, so that arms may be twisted and pockets tapped.” 140



Similarly, a U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit opinion noted that when a contribution made to a candidate is disclosed, “the recipient’s competitor will notice, and if the competitor should win the spender will not be among his favorite constituents.” 141 This logic applies equally to a contribution made to an independent super PAC supporting a particular candidate. For example, in 2013, when former New York governor Eliot Spitzer was trying to make a political comeback from his prostitution scandal by running for New York City comptroller, donors reportedly were terrified of contributing to a super PAC supporting his opponent, for fear that the disclosure of their contributions would result in retribution if the famously vindictive Spitzer were elected. 142 The flip side of disclosure’s deterrent effect is that donors seeking to ingratiate themselves with a candidate will have greater incentive to contribute to an independent expenditure effort if their contributions will be disclosed.



Alabama state senator Arthur Orr cited “‘mischievous situations,’ such as a donor contributing to a candidate as an individual and then anonymously giving to a group running ads against that same candidate,” as a reason to require additional disclosure. 143 This is mischievous indeed, since the contribution to the candidate (which is disclosed) would help the donor ingratiate himself or herself with an elected official, while the undisclosed contribution would allow the donor to speak his or her conscience. If a compulsory disclosure law were to close the door on donor privacy in Orr’s example, then the only door left for the donor would be ingratiation.



Although the Democratic Party in recent years generally has supported disclosure laws more than the Republican Party has, several Democrats opposed President Obama’s proposed government contractor disclosure executive order out of concerns that it would facilitate corruption. “We are concerned that requiring businesses to disclose their political activity when making an offer risks injecting politics into the contracting process,” Sen. Claire McCaskill and then-senator Joe Lieberman wrote in a letter to the president. 144



These consequences of disclosure, even if they do not necessarily fall within the definition of quid pro quo corruption that the Court articulated in _Citizens United_ , certainly fit within the broader concept of “corruption” that opponents of _Citizens United_ subscribe to. 145 And they are all counterpoints to the anti-corruption rationale for expanded disclosure laws.



Much of the modern campaign finance disclosure regime presupposes the verity of Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis’s famous maxim that “[s]unlight is said to be the best of disinfectants.” 146 But just as excessive sunlight also may cause damage, such as blinding, cataracts, and melanoma, 147 the key point that readers should take away from this paper is that there are proper and improper ways to implement disclosure, and a balanced approach is required.



Disclosure’s purpose should be to “allow[] citizens to keep tabs on their elected officials”—not for “the government to monitor its constituents.” 148 The legitimacy of disclosure laws is at its zenith when they focus on government transparency. Open government is essential to representative government and holding officials accountable and responsive to the public. When disclosure laws’ purpose is to monitor private individuals and groups exercising their First Amendment rights, however, such laws become an authoritarian tool for intimidation, retribution, and the suppression of democratic debate.



Thus, if we were to diagram a hierarchy of disclosure laws in decreasing order of legitimacy, it might look something like Figure 1.



With these principles in mind, I recommend the following for how disclosure laws should be amended or implemented:



 **Retain Disclosure of Contributors to Candidates’ Campaign Committees, Political Party Committees, and Traditional PACs, But Raise Disclosure Thresholds.** The anti-corruption rationale is much stronger for requiring donor disclosure for campaign contributions made directly to candidates and elected officials than it is for requiring disclosure of donors to independent groups. Politicians exercise complete or ultimate control over the funds that are given directly to their campaign committees. Although most jurisdictions now prohibit campaign funds from being used for personal expenses, 149 such funds are still highly valuable to politicians, most of whom seem to be motivated by getting elected or reelected as much as (or more than) anything else in life. 150 To the extent that political party committees and traditional PACs (i.e., those that are not super PACs) coordinate with and make contributions directly to candidates, requiring such entities to report their donors also is appropriate. 151



 **Figure 1**  
Legitimacy of disclosure laws  




Nonetheless, the existing law requires excessive disclosure of small donors. The current threshold for disclosure of donors applies to anyone who gives more than $200 during a calendar year to a federal candidate, political party committee, or PAC, 152 and some states even purport to require disclosure of donors who give so much as a penny. 153 These days, no one believes that giving $201 (much less a penny) to a congressional or presidential candidate is going to get donors more than a thank you note signed by an autopen (if even that). Relatedly, an organization that merely accepts contributions or makes expenditures totaling more than $1,000 could be required to register as a federal PAC, which in turn triggers broad donor disclosure requirements. 154 Most disclosure thresholds are not adjusted for inflation. Even ardent supporters of more compulsory disclosure laws agree that the donor disclosure thresholds should be raised so that small donors are not unnecessarily disclosed. 155 These thresholds also should be pegged to inflation so that they are not eroded over time.



 **Limit Disclosure Requirements for Independent Speech.** As the Court has postulated of independent political speech: “The absence of prearrangement and coordination of an expenditure with the candidate or his agent not only undermines the value of the expenditure to the candidate, but also alleviates the danger that expenditures will be given as a quid pro quo for improper commitments from the candidate.” 156 Real-world examples corroborate this assessment. Individuals have long been permitted to make independent expenditures in unlimited amounts urging the election or defeat of candidates, 157 and since 2010 have been permitted to contribute unlimited amounts to super PACs. 158 Nonetheless, we have seen donors regularly risking and incurring serious criminal penalties to make “straw contributions” to candidates (i.e., reimbursing others for making contributions to circumvent per-individual contribution limits). 159 This is strong evidence that donors agree with the Court’s view that contributions given directly to candidates’ campaign coffers may have more ingratiation value than independent spending.



Relatedly, absent compulsory disclosure requirements, there is an inherent information asymmetry between direct contributions to candidates and funds given to and spent by independent speakers. Regardless of any disclosure laws, politicians certainly know who is contributing to their campaign accounts. However, without campaign finance reports, politicians generally would not know, and would have difficulty verifying, whether donors are giving to independent groups unless they were looking at the groups’ bank statements and canceled checks. Given concerns about running afoul of coordination laws, this seems unlikely.



In short, when applied to independent speech, disclosure laws serve, at best, an attenuated societal interest in preventing corruption, and may even facilitate corruption by enabling politicians to verify who is and is not contributing to independent efforts to support their campaigns. 160 As explained earlier, there also does not appear to be any evidentiary support for the heuristic or “informational interest” in disclosure. Thus, compulsory donor disclosure laws should be applied as sparingly as possible to independent political speech.



If disclosure requirements for independent speech must be enacted:



The use of “census or other standard government occupation categories” on disclosure reports in lieu of a donor’s name and other personal information, as Stanford professor Bruce E. Cain has suggested, also warrants further consideration. 164 This may better serve the purported heuristic or “informational interest” in disclosure (to the extent that real-world evidence shows this interest exists), while shielding individual donors from the threat of harassment and retaliation.



We live in an age in which support for free speech is under siege. The very idea of free speech has come to be associated with white supremacists and other odious causes. 165 Hundreds of speakers have been disinvited from institutions of higher education because of disagreements with their viewpoints. 166 Beating opponents in debate is no longer enough; instead, they have to be physically beaten—or even killed—if we don’t like what they have to say. 167 Objectionable speech must be preceded by “trigger warnings,” 168 and the liberty to speak is banished to designated “free speech zones.” 169 Forty percent of millennials support laws to prohibit certain offensive speech—far more than any other generation polled. 170 Both sides of the ideological spectrum denounce the other side’s news sources as “fake news.” 171



In this environment, it is more important than ever for individuals to have the option to speak collectively without the fear of reprisals and threats that too frequently result from having their names, addresses, and employer information posted on the Internet as a result of compulsory donor disclosure laws. Unfortunately, the debate over disclosure and donor privacy has become just as polarized as the debates over the substantive issues that donors wish to engage in. The FEC, for example, for more than 20 years used to routinely approve exempting the Socialist Workers Party from donor disclosure requirements. 172 But lately, certain commissioners at the agency caught in the disclosure fever have deadlocked on renewing this exemption for the Socialist Workers. 173



Such an absolutist stance in favor of disclosure is unwarranted. Disclosure is not an unalloyed good. Rather, it is a policy prescription that must be approached with more nuance, especially in light of the serious constitutional concerns and tangible harms that are implicated. Judicial holdings underpinning the present-day push for more compulsory disclosure laws should be examined more critically, especially for outdated or unsupported assumptions. And policy justifications for disclosure should be viewed with more skepticism, especially when they are advanced by incumbent lawmakers who have a conflict of interest in passing laws that hinder speech unfavorable to them.

From the Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres a clear indication for those “CO2 is plant food” scoffers that the plants don’t care what they think.
Productivity of land plants may be greater than previously thought
Researchers recommend the reworking of global carbon models in Nature
This press release is available in German.
For the news study the reseachers analyzed also datas of the Cape Grim air archive at CSIRO's Aspendale laboratories. The Air Archive is an irreplaceable collection of air samples from Cape Grim, northwest Tasmania. It is like a library or museum of air that provides valuable information about greenhouse and ozone depleting gases. Every three months, researchers have filled stainless steel flasks with about 1 000 litres of pristine air, which is then stored in the Cape Grim Air Archive at CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research in Aspendale, Victoria. The Cape Grim Air Archive was initiated by Dr Paul Fraser in 1978, knowing that one day scientists might be interested in measuring gases that at the time were not being (or could not be) measured. CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research near Melbourne in Australia undertakes research into the atmospheric environment and belongs to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO).

London – The global uptake of carbon by land plants may be up to 45 per cent more than previously thought. This is the conclusion of an international team of scientists, based on the variability of heavy oxygen atoms in the carbon dioxide of the atmosphere driven by the El Niño effect. As the oxygen atoms in carbon dioxide were converted faster than expected during the El Niño years, current estimates for the uptake of carbon by plants are probably too low. These should be corrected upwards, say the researchers in the current issue of the scientific journal NATURE. Instead of 120 petagrams of carbon, the annual global vegetation uptake probably lies between 150 and 175 petagrams of carbon. This value is a kind of gross national product for land plants and indicates how productive the biosphere of the Earth is. The reworking of this so-called global primary productivity would have significant consequences for the coupled carbon cycle-climate model used in climate research to predict future climate change.
Lisa Welp of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California in San Diego and her colleagues evaluated the data for the global isotopic composition of the greenhouse gas CO2 over the last 30 years. This analysis indicated regular fluctuations between years and a connection with the El Niño phenomenon in the Pacific. Overall, El Niño years are warmer. They are also characterised by greater precipitation in South America and less intensive monsoons in Southeast Asia.

The researchers found a more rapid recovery of the

isotopic ratios following the El Niño events than assumed, indicating a shorter conversion time for CO2 in the terrestrial biosphere. On the basis of these data, the authors calculate the so-called global primary productivity (GPP). They now propose correcting this in the global models from 120 to 150-175 petagrams) of carbon annually.
Since 1977 the isotopic ratios in the carbon dioxide of the atmosphere (18O/16O und 13C/12C) have been measured in order to better understand the global carbon cycle, as the exchange processes between the biosphere, the atmosphere and the oceans are reflected in these values. “We assume that the redistribution of moisture and rain in the tropics during El Niño raises the 18O/16O ratio in precipitation and plant water and then signals this to the atmospheric carbon dioxide”, explains Lisa Welp the new approach of the researchers.
“Our atmosphere is a perfect blender. Changes in its levels of trace gases – such as carbon dioxide – reflect the overall release and uptake of trace gases from all sources. So if you measure the carbon exchange of a forest ecosystem, for example, you “only” get the net exchange of all the carbon taken up by the trees for photosynthesis and all the carbon released by the trees and soil “, writes Dr. Matthias Cuntz of the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research (UFZ) in his commentary in the same issue of NATURE. The gross-exchange fluxes, such as photosynthesis, are however accessible only with difficulty. “Global estimates therefore depend upon a number of assumptions. This includes, for example, how many of the CO2 molecules entering a plant are actually fixed by photosynthesis. The researchers of Lisa Welp’s team assume that around 43 per cent of all CO2 molecules entering a plant are taken up by the plant. If this were only 34%, the estimate would fall to about 120 billion tons of carbon – that is, to the currently accepted value”, for Matthias Cuntz reason of thought. In his opinion, the new findings do not completely upset the research to date. Nevertheless, they demonstrate an interesting new method for the determination of plant productivity over large areas. In future, the combination of several isotopic methods with conventional measurements represents a promising approach.
The now published study was carried out under the direction of Ralph F. Keeling, a professor of oceanography and the son of the late Charles David Keeling, after whom the so-called Keeling curve was named. This graph shows the concentration of CO2 of the volcano Mauna Loa on Hawaii since the year 1957. In the 1950s the CO2 fraction in the earth’s atmosphere was still around 315 ppm. In 2011, by comparison, it has already increased to 390 ppm. With his measurements Keeling was able to show for the first time that the concentration of the greenhouse gas increases in relation to changing land use and the combustion of fossil fuels. This new study underscores the importance of long-term measurements of the isotope 18O in the carbon dioxide of the atmosphere from the scientific point of view, as this occupies a key position between the carbon cycle and the hydrogen cycle.

It’s time for another G‐​something meeting. Is it the G-20? The G-2? The G-47? No, it’s the G-8. Its members are the world’s most important industrialized states. And they gather to discuss the most pressing issues of the day.



This meeting, located in Northern Ireland’s Belfast, is being chaired by British prime minister David Cameron, as his nation holds the group’s presidency this year. The _Economist_ proclaimed that “The British agenda is ambitious.” London’s three main goals are trade, taxation and transparency.



Despite the usual flurry of ponderous public statements and breathless press analyses, the meeting likely will be a waste. Consider the official agenda.



 ** _Trade._** This is an important issue, especially given the collapse of the World Trade Organization’s Doha round of trade liberalization. However, the G-8 is unlikely to achieve much. One of the main stumbling blocks to Doha was agricultural subsidies by the United States and the European Union. Yet nothing here has changed or will change. To the contrary, Congress is moving forward on an expensive new “Farm Bill,” and the EU maintains the even more expensive Common Agricultural Policy.





America is broke and cannot be expected to forever subsidize its many prosperous and populous allies.



Proposals for Asia‐​Pacific and trans‐​Atlantic trade liberalization remain ever complicated and perhaps impossible. America is pursuing the Trans‐​Pacific Partnership, but including Japan while excluding China creates significant political complications. France’s objections are reducing the likelihood of reaching a meaningful U.S.-EU pact. Europe is involved in a no‐​win trade tiff with China.



There would be enormous benefit if the G-8 participants could iron out at least some of their many differences on these issues. But the disputes run deep and the time available is limited. The meeting is more likely to generate more lofty rhetoric about the possibilities of increased commerce than meaningful progress overcoming barriers to trade liberalization.



 ** _Taxation._** If there is one issue on which politicians of every nation agree, it is the need to squeeze their peoples ever more tightly. Hence the concerted attack on “tax havens” and “aggressive tax planning,” especially by multinational corporations. The European Union issued a press release dryly opining on how “Tax fraud and tax evasion limit the capacity governments to raise money and implement their economic and social policies.”



Of course, the latter usually can be summarized as paying off influential interest groups and turning citizens into dependents. If politicians were not so avaricious and special interests were not so domineering, productive people across the globe could keep more of their hard‐​earned cash and would have less incentive to evade taxes. Unfortunately, in this area the G-8 has a strong incentive to be more “productive,” uniting to sacrifice what is left of their citizens’ privacy in order to grab the last penny possible. Satisfying the voracious appetite of politicians will make all of us worse off.



 ** _Transparency._** The G-8 will press to promote transparency and combat corruption in global commerce, especially in terms of “extractive industries and forestry.” It’s a worthwhile effort, but the biggest offenders, of course, are non‐​G‐​8 members throughout the Third World. Thus, conferences, codes, legislation, proclamations and the like all will have only limited effects so long as governments of poor countries constitute systems of organized looting.



The most important single step in this direction the G-8 could take would be to discourage rather than encourage government‐​to‐​government transfers, or misnamed “foreign aid.” (G-8 gatherings usually include boilerplate promises to up official development assistance.) The wealthy nations should cut the financial windpipe of the most corrupt and wasteful regimes. Private humanitarian and development assistance from NGOs to private people, and private investment and trade to private companies, are far more likely to deliver positive economic and social results with more limited opportunities for graft and abuse.



 ** _Other Issues._** There is much else to be discussed at the meeting, but few results to be expected. The leaders will chat about boosting the international economy, even though none of them know how to do so. Even Europe’s much‐​criticized austerity is anything but, with most governments choosing to raise taxes over cutting outlays. G-8 participants will offer more than their usual quotient of high‐​minded chatter on climate change, but with global temperatures essentially unchanged for more than a decade, no one wants to wreck their economy for a purported crisis that is looking ever less like a serious problem.



The assembled states also will discuss security issues, such as Syria, on which they are badly divided. The Obama administration’s decision to provide arms to the insurgents is more likely to intensify combat than overthrow the Assad government. Other issues, from Iran to Israeli‐​Palestinian negotiations to Korea, range from improbable to hopeless, and are likely to yield more pious rhetoric than practical solutions.



Most important, of course, will be the manifold photo opportunities for government leaders to “exercise leadership” on behalf of their voters. Remember the important outcomes of last year’s G-8 meeting? Can you cite the location of the 2011 gathering? Are you able to repeat the themes of the 2010 summit? Do you know which country presided over the organization in 2009? Almost certainly the answer to all those questions is no, even for political junkies. In practice, despite all of the public‐​relations bloviating, the summits rarely generate any lasting results.



Yet, the G-8 process incorporates a curious anomaly for the United States, one not relevant for most other members. That is, while the United States eagerly pursues greater economic integration with the other seven participants in the name of encouraging prosperity and growth, Washington could achieve the same result for America simply by cutting back subsidies to the same members.



After all, most of the federal government’s outsize military bill (roughly 45 percent of the globe’s total) is to protect allied states. The G-8 members of NATO face few obvious and serious security threats. The most obvious adversary, Russia (also a G-8 member), isn’t likely to attack even the easternmost (non‐​G‐​8) members of the “trans‐​Atlantic” alliance. (Of course, what is “trans‐​Atlantic” about the Baltic States, Slovenia, Romania, Croatia, Slovakia and Albania is not obvious.)



Most of the rest of U.S. “defense” outlays are for G-8 member Japan and its neighbors. Tokyo devotes about one‐​fourth of America’s effort to its military while expecting Washington to do any heavy lifting in Japan’s defense. In particular, the United States is tasked to deter any unlikely Chinese attacks on the Japanese home islands and defend Tokyo’s contested claims to unimportant rock piles in the Pacific against Beijing’s increasingly aggressive counterclaims. If America is attacked, Japan’s job is to issue a critical press statement.



U.S. officials may enjoy the illusion of running the world, but the resulting foreign policy, if it deserves to be called that, is no longer affordable. America is broke and cannot be expected to forever subsidize its many prosperous and populous allies. Washington should add some substance to the latest G-8 summit and start moving in a new direction.

From the December 2010 big snow
It seem airport operator BAA has realized that Global warming has really dumped on them the last two years and rather than be caught with their pants down again, they 3x increased their equipment and staff ready to clear snow.
From BBC: Heathrow airport triples snow clearance fleet
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-15105627
Heathrow airport has tripled the number of snow clearance vehicles to tackle severe winter weather.
Operator BAA also has three times as many staff ready to clear snow compared with last year.
Thousands of passengers were left stranded at the airport as 4,000 flights were cancelled over five days for heavy snow before Christmas. 

But BAA said it now has 185 snow clearance vehicles and has 468 staff per shift, compared to 117 last year.
The operator said it has invested £32.4m so far to tackle severe weather.
BAA had been criticised following last year’s disruptions and a report accused the operator of a breakdown in communication and lack of “preparedness” for the bad weather.
After the publication of the Winter Resilience Enquiry Report, BAA promised to invest £50m to avoid facing disruptions on a similar scale.
Announcing its “winter resilience programme”, the airports operator said it has introduced a new “reservist” role whereby up to 950 staff will be deployed to the terminals to help passengers during disruption.

Guest post by Dr. Roger Pielke Senior
Missing The Major Point Of “What Is Climate Sensitivity”

There is a post by Zeke on Blackboard titled  Agreeing [See also the post on Climate Etc  Agreeing(?)].
Zeke starts the post with the text
“My personal pet peeve in the climate debate is how much  time is wasted on arguments that are largely spurious, while more  substantive and interesting subjects receive short shrift.”
I agree with this view, but conclude that Zeke is  missing a fundamental issue.
Zeke writes
“Climate sensitivity is somewhere between 1.5 C and 4.5 C  for a doubling of carbon dioxide, due to feedbacks (primarily water  vapor) in the climate system…”
The use of the terminology “climate sensitivity” indicates an importance of  the climate system to this temperature range that does not exist. The  range of temperatures of  “1.5 C and 4.5 C for a doubling of carbon dioxide” refers  to a global annual average surface temperature anomaly that is not even  directly measurable, and its interpretation is even unclear, as we  discussed in the paperPielke Sr., R.A., C. Davey, D. Niyogi, S. Fall, J. Steinweg-Woods, K.  Hubbard, X. Lin, M. Cai, Y.-K. Lim, H. Li, J. Nielsen-Gammon, K. Gallo,  R. Hale, R. Mahmood, S. Foster, R.T. McNider, and P. Blanken, 2007: Unresolved issues with the assessment of multi-decadal global land surface temperature trends. J. Geophys. Res., 112, D24S08, doi:10.1029/2006JD008229.
This view of a surface temperature anomaly expressed by  “climate sensitivity” is grossly misleading the public and policymakers  as to what are the actual climate metrics that matter to society and the  environment. A global annual average surface temperature anomaly is  almost irrelevant for any climatic feature of importance. 
Even with respect to the subset of climate effects that is referred to as global warming, the appropriate climate metric is heat changes as measured in Joules (e.g. see).  The  global annual average surface temperature anomaly is only useful  to the extent it correlates with the global annual average climate  system heat anomaly [most of which occurs within the upper oceans].   Such heating, if it occurs, is important as it is one component (the  “steric component”) of sea level rise and fall.
For other societally and environmentally important climate effects,  it is the regional atmospheric and ocean circulations patterns that  matter. An accurate use of the terminology “climate sensitivity” would  refer to the extent that these circulation patterns are altered due to  human and natural climate forcings and feedbacks. As discussed in  the excellent post on Judy Curry’s weblog
Spatio-temporal chaos
finding this sensitivity is a daunting challenge.
I have proposed  definitions which  could be used to advance the discussion of what we “agree on”, in my post
The Terms “Global Warming” And “Climate Change” – What Do They Mean?
As I wrote there
Global Warming is an increase in the  heat (in Joules) contained within the climate system. The majority of  this accumulation of heat occurs in the upper 700m of the oceans.
Global Cooling is a decrease in the heat (in  Joules) contained within the climate system. The majority of this  accumulation of heat occurs in the upper 700m of the oceans.
Global warming and cooling occur within each year as shown, for example, in Figure 4 in
Ellis et al. 1978: The annual variation in the global heat balance of the Earth. J. Geophys. Res., 83, 1958-1962.
Multi-decadal global warming or cooling involves a long-term  imbalance between the global warming and cooling that occurs each year.
Climate Change involves any alteration in the  climate system , which is schematically illustrated  in the figure below (from NRC, 2005)

which persists for an (arbitrarily defined) long enough time period.
Shorter term climate change is referred to as climate variability.   An example of a climate change is if a growing season 20 year average   of 100 days was reduced by 10 days in the following 20 years.  Climate  change includes changes in the statistics of weather (e.g. extreme  events such as droughts, land falling hurricanes, etc), but also include  changes in other climate system components (e.g. alterations in the pH  of the oceans, changes in the spatial distribution of malaria carrying  mosquitos, etc).
The recognition that climate involves much more than global  warming and cooling is a very important issue. We can have climate  change (as defined in this weblog post) without any long-term global  warming or cooling.  Such climate change can occur both due to natural  and human causes.”
It is within this framework of definitions that Zeke and Judy should  solicit feedback in response to their recent posts.  I recommend a  definition of “climate sensitivity” as
Climate Sensitivity is  the response of the statistics of weather (e.g. extreme events such as  droughts, land falling hurricanes, etc), and other climate system  components (e.g. alterations in the pH of the oceans, changes in the  spatial distribution of malaria carrying mosquitos, etc) to a climate  forcing (e.g. added CO2, land use change, solar output changes, etc).   This more accurate definition of climate sensitivity is what should be  discussed rather than the dubious use of a global annual average surface  temperature anomaly for this purpose.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWe’ve been hearing a lot of bogus “model science” asking us to believe the preposterous notion that a warm Arctic and reduced sea ice there “could” lead to bitter cold winters across Europe and North America. In summary the new science insists warming leads to more cold. Now there’s a new paper out in the Geophysical Research Letters titled: Solar influence on winter severity in Central Europe, which tells us this is a load of BS.

The sun has a major impact on climate. And there’s no denying it: solar activity reached record levels over the 20th century. This file is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported
The key points of the paper:

Freezing of the Rhine occurred from 1780-1963 regularly during sunspot minima.
Coldest winter continue to occur during sunspot minima even today.
This cooling is a regional phenomenon, but not a hemispheric signal.

The authors used historical reports of freezing of the river Rhine. They concluude:
The historical data show that 10 of the 14 freeze years occurred close to sunspot minima and only one during a year of moderate El Niño. This solar influence is underpinned by corresponding atmospheric circulation anomalies in reanalysis data covering the period 1871 to 2008. Accordingly, weak solar activity is empirically related to extremely cold winter conditions in Europe also on such long time scales. This relationship still holds today, however the average winter temperatures have been rising during the last decades.”
The cause of the rising average winter temperatures over the last decades will be attributed by some to greenhouse gases. But we have to recall that the sun not only undergoes 11-year cycles, but also, 22, 87 and 1000-year cycles. In happens that solar activity was at a very high level over the last decades, and so warming over the last decade, especially in combination with the warm phases of the PDO and AMO, should not surprise us at all.
As the paper says, the sun plays a major role, and so ignoring its cycles in models is just bad science. The tragedy of it all is that the solar cycles are known and they could be easily built into the models, which then in turn would gain immensely in value. But because they do not produce the desired results for activist scientists, they are left out and forcing tricks from other factors such as aerosols and volcanoes are used for explaining the inconvenient cool periods.

If you believe the majority of witnesses at the recent House State Government Committee hearings in Harrisburg, you would think illegal immigration is the single‐​biggest problem confronting the commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Speaker after speaker blamed unauthorized immigrant workers for unemployment, crime and budget woes.



As one of the witnesses, I understand the frustration over the failure of the federal government to fix our dysfunctional immigration system, but the raft of Arizona‐​style bills the committee is weighing would take the state in the wrong direction.



Pennsylvania faces many challenges, but the inflow of too many hardworking immigrants is not among them. Pennsylvania is one of the slowest‐​growing states. It ranks 30th in the share of the population that is foreign born, and illegal immigrants are only 1.3 percent of the state population, ranking it 40th among the states.





The answer to illegal immigration is not to criminalize honest work but to change our national immigration system to meet the future labor needs of our nation.



It might produce a good sound bite, but it is misleading to claim that every low‐​skilled immigrant chased out of Pennsylvania will mean a job for an unemployed American. The real‐​world economy doesn’t work that way. Low‐​skilled immigrants do not compete directly with the large majority of American workers.



More aggressive enforcement against illegal immigration will hurt Pennsylvania’s economy. Removing low‐​skilled immigrant workers from the labor force would reduce investment and production in such industries as agriculture, retail, tourism, construction and landscaping. It would reduce the related job openings in more skilled positions, reducing employment for native‐​born middle‐​class Americans. Less investment and employment would in turn reduce government revenue.



The answer to illegal immigration is not to criminalize honest work but to change our national immigration system to meet the future labor needs of our nation. We need to expand channels for legal immigration through a robust temporary worker program. Immigration reform would replace the current population of illegal immigrant workers with a legalized population, to the benefit of the immigrants and native‐​born.



It is wrong to blame undocumented immigrants for unleashing a crime wave as more than one witnessed claimed. There is no evidence that illegal immigrants in Pennsylvania are causing a general increase in the crime rate. Nationwide, the rate of violent crime in the last two decades has plunged during a time when the undocumented population was rising rapidly. In fact, illegal immigrants typically seek to avoid any encounter with law enforcement that could lead to deportation.



Arizona‐​type laws would make life more difficult for Pennsylvania law enforcement officers. By deputizing them as agents for federal immigration enforcement, legislators would be diverting resources away from combating real crime. More police hours and jail space will be consumed with prosecuting dishwashers and janitors rather than rapists and robbers.



A state‐​level crackdown will only push undocumented immigrants further underground. They will be less likely to cooperate with law enforcement and come forward as witnesses. This is why the Arizona Association of Chiefs of Police opposed that state’s S.B. 1070.



As for the state budget, illegal immigration has not caused a surge in public school enrollment. The share of Pennsylvania’s population enrolled in K-12 public schools is almost exactly the same today — 14.1 percent — as it was 20 years ago and significantly lower than in 1970 when baby boomers were crowding classrooms.



Pennsylvania’s school‐​age population is the fourth‐​lowest in the nation as a share of the total population. Legislators should be far more worried about why so few future workers and taxpayers are moving through the educational pipeline than about the relatively few additional students whose parents are here illegally.



As Texas Gov. Rick Perry will tell you, his state has led the nation in employment and economic growth in the last decade by keeping taxes and regulations in check. Texas also is a state with 10 times as many illegal immigrants in its workforce as Pennsylvania. Those low‐​skilled immigrant workers have not been a barrier to economic growth and job creation in Texas. In fact, they have helped residents there to be more productive at home and more competitive in global markets.



The same can be true for Pennsylvania. State legislators in Harrisburg should focus their time on creating a better business climate at home while urging the congressional delegation in Washington to expand opportunities for legal immigration through comprehensive reform.

 _ **One Nation Under Contract: The Outsourcing of American Power and the Future of Foreign Policy**_  
By Allison Stanger  
Yale University Press, 256 pages



Of all the books published about private military and security contractors in recent years, with more coming out all the time, few really understand the phenomenon of outsourcing roles that were formerly the preserve of government.



Either they are academic theses and dissertations rewritten for public consumption, such as Peter Singer’s _Corporate Warriors_ , a rare useful book on the subject; ill‐​concealed hysterical jeremiads masquerading as dispassionate journalism, such as Jeremy Scahill’s over‐​the‐​top fulminations against Blackwater; or breathless “I was there taking fire in the sandbox” memoirs from conflict zones.



Not many authors have paused to consider exactly what is going on. To paraphrase what was said about the US intelligence community after the September 11, 2001, attacks, they don’t connect the dots. Finally someone has.



That someone is Allison Stanger, professor of international politics and economics at Middlebury College in the United States.



Stanger points out firstly that private contractors are working for more parts of the US government than just the Pentagon or State Department. Secondly, contrary to popular assumptions, most private contractors working in areas that used to be the exclusive preserves of government, such as foreign policy, military and intelligence sectors, homeland security, or foreign aid, are not a bunch of unscrupulous greed heads, although they are certainly in pursuit of profit.



Stanger does not only focus on the for‐​profit private contractors doing military and security work. She also looks at the Department of Homeland Security, and the non‐​profit players working in the development field. When foreign aid contributions by the private sector dwarf those of the US Agency for International Development, and in any case most of USAID’s work is done by contractors, one wonders what the point of it is.



The ubiquitousness of such contractors is a sign that something both revolutionary and global in scope is happening that can only become more prevalent.



As Stanger recognizes, what is going on is essentially a manifestation of globalization. She notes:



Globalization and our penchant for privatization have transformed power itself, expanding the range of options for individuals to make a difference. When Washington outsources so much of its work in the private sector, the old debate about the size of government is rendered moot. We don’t need big government or small government. We need good government. And good government in the information age will harness all the networks at its disposal to advance the public interest.



Since privatization is intimately connected to globalization, one can’t do away with the former without damaging the latter.



The problem of most commentators, regardless of whether they are supporters or critics of outsourcing and privatization, is outmoded thinking. They are like the old war planners who used to worry about the Soviet Union overrunning Western Europe and not having a clue that the real threat was non‐​governmental groups like al‐​Qaeda.



The very definition of power in the 21st century has changed. While outsourcing has its problems, it can also be a source of creative bottom‐​up initiatives with an undeniable foreign policy impact. With Bono of the rock group U2 fighting AIDS in Africa, Walmart promoting energy efficiency, and Al Gore moving forward the global debate over climate change, foreign policy isn’t just for diplomats anymore.



This post‐​Cold War collection of actors constitutes a new kind of empire, one that has no ruler or subjects. It is truly a coalition of the willing. While it would not exist without the American contribution, the US does not control it. That makes outsourcing both inviting and unpredictable. It advances its interests through the power of ideals: economic freedom, equality of opportunity and sustainability.



This global empire could, in Stanger’s view, work for the benefit of all. But doing so would have to first acknowledge that the current practice of unenlightened outsourcing creates an enormous accountability vacuum that has enabled gross fiscal irresponsibility, dangerous apathy among the public, and the “inadvertent” militarization of foreign policy. “Inadvertent” likely gives too much the benefit of the doubt to American policymakers, but that is secondary to Stanger’s thesis.



It is a sign of how ideologues have dominated the debate over the role of government in society in the past few decades that her diagnosis of the pros and cons is really quite unsurprising. To argue, as she does, that “outsourcing as presently practiced is scandalous, but turning the clock back and reasserting top‐​down government control though it is no solution”, something that Ronald Reagan and Al Gore could agree on.



Essentially, Stanger is not just calling for limits on what contractors can do, as do many critics. She is also calling for government to step up to the plate to resume its role as the irreplaceable “chief custodian of the public interest”. Anybody who has even cursorily studied this issue in recent years and read the reports from auditing agencies such as the US Government Accountability Office, the Defense Contracting Audit Agency, the Defense Contracting Management Agency, various agency inspector generals and listened to congressional hearings understands that government has been missing in action.



Stanger correctly notes that it is easy to point fingers. But that risks missing the forest for the trees. She writes:



It is easy to see things gone awry and to scapegoat contractors. But contractors aren’t the problem; the problem is the loss of good government. If the contractors in Iraq seem wildly expensive, it is not because corporate greed has dictated outcomes but because government’s aspirations there have been far too ambitious and its controls far too few. When private security forces overstep moral bounds it is ultimately government’s responsibility for having deployed them in a conflict zone with too little legal recourse if they misbehaved.



None of the above is to say that Stanger thinks outsourcing is without problems. While she recognizes it is here to stay, she is not reluctant to list its shortcomings. In that regard, a section in chapter two detailing the US government’s feeble attempts to keep track of what it is outsourcing and paying for it is revelatory.



Likewise, chapter five, where she demolishes the cost‐​savings arguments made by advocates of defense privatization, which have been meekly accepted as true without empirical proof for far too long, is worth the price of the book alone.



She also notes numerous examples of contracting run amuck, the difficulties of oversight due to the web of subcontracting (which the government has only recently started tracking) and the way that state secrecy, aided by contractors’ frequent excuse that proprietary business information cannot be released, compounds the problem.



The bottom line for Stanger is that the laissez‐​faire ideology where government forks money out to the private sector and gets out of the way — so popular among free marketers and recent Republican and Democrat administrations — is not acceptable.



While the private sector is both integrated into and crucial to American foreign policy, it is not entitled to a blank check or a blind eye. Government has a rightful role to play. It can start by not assigning tasks, such as reconstruction, that should belong to other agencies, to the Pentagon. Such actions only further strengthen an already grotesquely militarized US foreign policy. Such a policy plays to American weakness, not American strength, because it is economically unsustainable, alienates allies and denudes the universal values that made America popular in the world to begin with.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe European media are just too embarrassed about having gotten it completely wrong when it comes to global warming. So they just continue pretending that the cold isn’t really happening. As people are freezing to death all around them this winter, they keep telling themselves (and us) it’s getting warmer! I’ve never witnessed such an astonishingly surreal situation.

Death toll due to cold keeps climbing in Eastern Europe. Photo credit: NOAA public domain photo.
As hundreds of lives are being lost this winter, the media refuse to see it, talk about it, to believe it. Instead they keep telling the people something has to be done about the warming. They tell us about Australia 20,000 km away. This is like watching a weird Star Trek episode of a planet where people are walking around like zombies. Can someone send a doctor over to declare this media brain dead?
To get the news about the deadly cold that is gripping Europe, Russia, Siberia and a large part of Asia, you really have to search beyond the flat-line mainstream media.
For example, Blick website today has the story on how so far this winter over 300 people have frozen to death in Eastern Europe:

Many cold deaths in Poland and Russia
Because of the cold, many persons in Poland, Russia and Lithuania have died. because of the forecast temperature fall to -20°C in the coming days, the Ministry of Interior in Warsaw on Tuesday has reminded the public to be more cautious. […]
19 people have frozen since the beginning of the year in Poland, 3 on Sunday alone. So far this winter more than 100 people have died. After water pipes had burst because of freezing, tens of thousands of Poles are now cut off from electricity.
In Russia the number of deaths due to the cold has climbed to about 190, this according to authorities in Moscow via Interfax news agency. Just in the last few days alone 7 people died of hypothermia.”

The death toll does not include the dozens that have died in Belarus, Ukraine and the rest of Eastern Europe, and so it is likely much higher.
Photo above is actually of the North Pole, and is to convey that it’s cold out.

"Nearly a third of all the food produced in the world is lost or wasted, according to the UN’s World Resources Institute. If we convert this mass into calories, it constitutes nearly a quarter of all food produced, which could have fed hungry and malnourished people around the world. But new technology that prolongs the life of fresh fruit and vegetables can help minimise this huge amount of waste. It is a sad irony that we waste so much food – especially fruit and vegetables – but still fail to feed the world’s ever increasing population. Clearly, our ability to produce larger quantities of fruit and vegetables is not the only guarantee for global food security. We need to start minimising the amount of food that is produced and then lost. Loss happens when food is spilt in transit or spoilt from heavy bruising or wilting. It is the unplanned result of an agricultural process gone wrong or technical limitations in storage, infrastructure, packaging or marketing. Good food is also wasted when it is simply thrown away before or after it spoils. A key way to minimise the amount of food lost is through postharvest technology, which can help make food last longer without losing nutrients. Once developed, it needs to be integrated into the global supply chain of food production. We need to optimise the food we already produce, especially in developing countries. This can be done by significantly improving the way food is handled after harvesting, particularly to make the process more hygienic. We should make sure postharvest techniques are environmentally friendly and, of course, non-toxic to humans when applied to food. The use of natural biodegradable products as an alternative to synthetic chemicals has shown remarkable improvements in maintaining fruit quality and extending shelf life. These natural products are non-toxic to humans and safe. Chitosan, for example, is a natural product obtained from crustacean shells. It has been shown to significantly maintain papaya fruit when applied to it. In combination with Gum Arabic (hardened sap obtained from the acacia tree) it can also delay the ripening of bananas. Gum Arabic can also be used on its own to enhance the shelf life and postharvest quality of tomatoes. Cinnamon oil is another natural product that has been shown to delay postharvest rotting in bananas and extending their storage life for up to 28 days. Our research at the Centre of Excellence for Post-harvest Biotechnology at Nottingham University’s Malaysia Campus is making these natural products into nano-forms or submicron particles to control postharvest diseases. This technology has so far been used to delay ripening in tomatoes and enhance their phenolic content, as well as extending the life of dragon fruit for up to 28 days. These are just a few examples, with many more being developed to improve the quality and shelf life of fresh fruit to help stop it going to waste. The way that fresh food is packaged is crucial to how long it can last. Synthetic chemicals are currently used to control postharvest diseases but consumers worry about the chemical residues they leave on fruit, their environmental impact and the potential for pathogens to become resistant to them. Our research is a response to this,  developing more environmentally friendly and non-chemical approaches.  This includes packing food in containers that modify the atmosphere to prevent decay, hot water treatment or blanching and most importantly using natural biodegradable products as an alternative to synthetic chemicals. Once proper postharvest technologies are used efficiently, food losses can be minimised and the problem of food insecurity alleviated. We believe that developing postharvest management techniques using natural products is the way forward, especially since these natural biodegradable products we are researching can also contribute to traditional medicine and pharmacology as we learn more about our natural environment. Hopefully too, we can develop better ways of reducing the huge amount of food loss that takes place and focus on getting food to those who need it."

I was out today for a walk. Although here the temperature read -2°C, the strong wind from the Northeast cut into you like a knife – it’s horrendous. To me it felt like -20°C. It’s going to get worse before better. RTL reports it’s going to get even colder in the days ahead:
Tonight in some cities again new cold records will be set for March. While the Brocken has already shattered the old record of -13.9°C  (21 March 1980) with a reading of -14,5°C, in other cities like Berlin it could be the coldest night in over 100 years.”
To be fair, they mean the coldest March temperatures in a 100 years.
RTL also writes that also Great Britain “has been transformed into a winter wonderland” with “thousands of schools closing in Ireland on Friday.”
Motorists had to be rescued from highways as cars were trapped in drifting snow.
In the city of Kiev in Ukraine a half meter of snow fell during a snow storm that hit Friday night. Officials have declared a state of emergency for the city’s 3 million inhabitants.

"**Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic on Saturday. We'll have another update for you on Sunday.**
If MPs do not back the government's tougher three-tier system when lockdown in England ends, hospitals could become ""overwhelmed"", Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove has warned. The government is facing opposition from Tory MPs over the new restrictions, which begin on 2 December. MPs are due to vote on the new measures ahead of their introduction. Labour is yet to decide whether it will support the restrictions. It has warned, however, that areas in tier three will be stretched to ""breaking point"" without further financial support from the Treasury.
Drinkers visiting pubs in tier two regions in England will have to leave when they finish eating, No 10 has confirmed. Pubs in those high risk areas can only open if they function as a restaurant, with alcohol only being served as part of a ""substantial meal"". The PM's spokesman said: ""We've been clear that, in tier two I believe, that you need to have a substantial meal if ordering any alcohol and it remains the case that the guidance says that once the meal is finished, it is at that point [you have to leave]."" So, what exactly are you allowed to do in each tier?
Mass testing plans in England could become a ""distraction"" from other priorities such as the rollout of a vaccine, health leaders have warned. Boris Johnson said that mass community testing, as seen in Liverpool, will be offered to all areas in tier three after lockdown ends. But experts said it requires ""enormous"" resources. In a joint statement, the Faculty of Public Health and the Association of Directors of Public Health said improving NHS Test and Trace must remain the top focus for testing. How does mass testing work?
Denmark's government has been urged to dig up millions of mink that were buried in mass graves. A mutated form of the virus on Danish fur farms prompted a cull of nearly 17 million of the animals. Two burial sites in Jutland are highly controversial, with one near a bathing lake and the other not far from a source of drinking water.
Recovery services have had to adapt in 2020, with some people using video-conferencing software to kick their drug and alcohol addictions. Jade Hargreaves, from Burnley, has been sober for three years and said losing face-to-face meetings was difficult. ""But people have got clean this year on Zoom and that's amazing. Hats off to them because it's hard,"" she said.

Hal Herzog’s excellent _Some We Love, Some We Hate, Some We Eat: Why It’s So Hard to Think Straight About Animals_ , contains the interesting tale of a woman so committed to animal rights that even other animal rights activists think that she’s nuts. If you think that takes some doing, then you’d be right. She lets chickens and other animals have free run of the house, to poo and scratch and chew wherever they like, refuses to kill flies and, she says, if her house was infested with termites, she’d leave them be.



She may well be as nutty as a vegan’s long-drop, as Herzog says, but the problem is: she’s also right. If you’re going to assert that animals have equal rights to humans, then hers is the only logically consistent stance. It says something for animal activism that its nuttiest adherents are actually its most consistent.



“A humanitarian is a hypocrite,” Orwell once said. But vegans are worse.



The vegan philosophy is, at its heart, quite often about ­reducing suffering. By not eating ­animals, you — by definition — reduce suffering. It’s a lovely idea.



It’s also the biggest con-job since Aunty Raindove said her tofurkey tastes just like chicken.



Consider peas. No vegan could turn their nose up at peas, even if they had the strength. They grow a lot of peas, here in Tasmania.



And to protect the peas, they have some wildlife fences, but also have to shoot a lot of ­animals…they [have] a licence to kill about 150 deer. They routinely kill about 800-1000 ­possums and 500 wallabies every year, along with a few ducks…So, more than 1500 animals die each year to grow about 75ha of peas for our freezers. That’s not 1500 rodents, which also die, and which some may see as collateral damage. That’s mostly warm-blooded animals of the cute kind, with a few birds thrown in…



The number of animals that die to produce vegan food is astonishing.



This isn’t because pea producers are some kind of bloodthirsty monsters. If they didn’t kill these animals, their crops would be devastated and the price of the few peas left would go through the roof. This is the grim reality of vegetable farming.



Vegans also like to hitch their recumbent bicycles to the climate change scare, claiming that farming meat uses too much of the Earth’s precious fluids, or something. Yet meat is not only one of the most efficient methods of food production, but also perhaps one of the least cruel.



According to an article by Mike Archer, Professor in the Faculty of Science at the University of NSW, roughly 25 times more sentient beings die to produce a kilo of protein from wheat than a kilo of protein from beef…Yes, most of them are rodents, but surely in the vegan world all warm-blooded life should be honoured equally?



The toll of horrors of vegan food production rolls on.



Over a five-year period up to 2013, rice farmers in NSW killed nearly 200,000 native ducks to protect their fields…[on one farm in Tasmania] we kill close to 5000 moths, slugs and snails each year to grow vege­tables, and thousands and thousands of aphids…



Vegans refuse to eat honey because it “exploits” bees, yet these emaciated hypocrites guzzle almond milk by the gallon.



According to _Scientific American_ , up to 80 billion domestic honeybees are estimated to have a hand in the Californian almond industry each year, up to half of which die during the management process and the long journeys to and from the large almond orchards. And that’s the carnage from just one crop.



  
No doubt pallid defenders of veganism will wave their limp, skinny arms and gibber weakly about “context” and that all this is just so much nit-picking. But the fact is that they’re just hypocrites. They talk a good game about preventing animal suffering, but they’re perfectly happy to turn a blind eye to the deaths of billions of animals so long as they’re not photogenically doe-eyed baby moo-cows.



Death is death. Suffering is suffering.



At least meat-eaters can chow down on their rare steak with a clear conscience.



Now, to quote the great Kinky Friedman, “wipe its ass and bring it to the table”.

"There is a boom in renewable energy sources coming online worldwide, but the predominant types – solar and wind – are problematic due to their variable nature. For most regions of the world, the sun cannot be expected to shine nor the wind blow when required. What is needed is a way to capture that energy when available, perhaps in the middle of the night, when demand is low, and then store it until it can be used when demand rises. But this is not a trivial problem to solve. According to the European Wind Energy Association, at the end of 2013, the UK had 10.5GW of wind turbine capacity installed, with more in planning and construction. As the percentage of energy generated from renewables increases, the intermittency problem becomes more acute, as has been seen in countries like Germany or Ireland. Germany, the country with the highest renewable capacity in Europe, has faced major technical problems due to the intermittency of renewable energy. The main issue is maintaining sufficient supply in the face of fluctuating levels of wind or sunshine. Back-up supply in the form of conventional power plants is required to meet demand. But as different types of power plant take time to come online – 48 hours for nuclear, 12 hours for coal-fired, down to a few hours for modern gas power plants, or ten seconds for the water released from a dam to start the turbines – having a back-up always available means having power plants running most of the time, which is inefficient and expensive. Another problem is integrating renewable energy supplies into the high voltage electricity grid. For example, in Ireland given the fact that there is more wind at night when many businesses usage is low, a significant percentage of the energy produced may have been dumped, because the electricity produced cannot easily be transmitted across the grid. So a means of storing energy is a vital part of any future energy system that includes a substantial amount of variable and uncontrollable renewable energy. Energy storage provides flexibility and reduces the need to rely on fossil fuel back-up power. Current energy storage technologies in use include direct electrical storage in batteries, thermal storage as hot water or in the fabric of buildings, using compressed air energy storage, or chemical storage (hydrogen). But identifying which approach is best is complex.  The right storage mix has to match the nature of the renewable energy source, the demands asked of the power grid, and the physical nature of the landscape and geology – as well as political and public opinion too. A lack of clear vision for energy storage means governments fail to adopt a joined-up approach. So while wind turbines and solar panels are blossoming under government programmes to support them, few governments recognise the importance of storage as the missing piece. In Japan, for instance, 15% of supplied electricity has been cycled through a storage facility, whereas in Europe it is closer to 10%, with Germany being the leading nation. In Germany, authorities have opted for pumped hydro storage as an energy storage solution, and has built a regulatory framework around it. Current UK energy storage deployment consists of pumped hydro (3,000MW), batteries (10MW) and liquid air (0.3MW). The UK’s geography restricts the possibility for pumped hydro despite its appeal, and the same goes for compressed air storage. But the UK government’s current technology-neutral view runs the risk that some of the alternative technologies not yet ready for deployment will not have the support they need to develop in time to address the challenge they are required to meet. So the UK’s solutions could be limited to hydrogen storage, batteries, or liquid air.   An analysis in 2012 indicated storage would have the greatest effect when deployed closest to demand. There may be a case for installing energy storage at the building level, in blocks of flats or residential areas, industrial estates or commercial districts – far more widely than at it is at present. In Japan, for example, sodium-sulfur batteries have been installed widely and successfully at the electricity distribution level, something that could be replicated in the UK. The Japanese government has also provided support for installing residential fuel cells in order to drive down prices. Between 2004 and 2008 prices dropped by 73%, and the installed base is increasing year on year – Japanese investment that the UK and others could capitalise on, and indeed, more international collaboration is needed. With many storage technologies and varying applications, there is no single perfect storage technology that will suit all. But if we are to hang our low-carbon future on renewables like wind and solar, then governments need to focus on supporting industry to develop energy storage tech – or risk fossil fuel dependence for many decades hence."

We’ve seen it once already – Arctic sea ice melting happened in the first half of the 20th century
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
When one hears or reads the reports about the Arctic sea ice, it helps to remember that satellite measurement did not begin until 1979. Thus we have data only for a period of just over 30 years. This barely suffices to fulfil the gladly used “climate definition” of a minimum period of 30 years. So we can’t avoid having a suspicious feeling, as we ask what did the sea ice do before satellite measurement began? Can we just simply skip over this and simply add the notation that we just don’t know much about it? Of course not. That would be too easy. Before the days of satellite measurement, ships travelled in the Arctic and brought back information about sea ice cover in the region.
In the following chronology, we present some of these reports. You’ll be amazed by what was observed.

"**Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic on Sunday. We'll have another update for you on Monday morning.**
Boris Johnson has written to Conservative MPs telling them tier restrictions will be reviewed every two weeks and promising them a new vote on the measures in January, in an attempt to avert a rebellion in the Commons this week. The prime minister also appealed to the nation in a separate letter to support the tiered system and not to ""blow"" the sacrifices that had already been made. He said: ""We can't just throw it all away - not when freedom is in sight. We have worked too hard, lost too many, sacrificed too much, just to see our efforts incinerated in another volcanic eruption of the virus.""
More than 150 people have been arrested during anti-lockdown protests in London's West End. Some protesters brandished signs reading ""All I want for Christmas is my freedom back"", ""Ditch the face masks"" and ""Stop controlling us"". The Metropolitan Police said on Saturday evening it had been a ""challenging day"". It said it made arrests for a number of different offences, including breaching coronavirus restrictions, assaulting a police officer and illegal drugs.
Peak rail fares should be suspended over Christmas and mass testing should be provided for transport workers to avoid travel ""chaos"" when restrictions ease, Labour has said. From 23-27 December, three households in the UK will be able to form a ""bubble"", with a surge in travel expected. Shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon said: ""This is too important for the government to ignore or leave until to the last minute. This is about protecting lives and livelihoods."" Here's what you need to know if you're travelling this Christmas.
The government has secured a further two million doses of a coronavirus vaccine from US firm Moderna, which has shown to be 95% effective in trials. This brings the UK's Moderna order to seven million - enough for around 3.5 million people. Meanwhile, Nadhim Zahawi has been appointed to oversee the rollout of the jabs in England. And we look at how memes are presenting disinformation about Covid-19 vaccines.
Teachers have warned of a ""collapse"" in secondary school attendance after the second wave of the pandemic spread across the UK during autumn.
Relatively few pupils have tested positive, but hundreds of thousands have had to learn from home after being required to self-isolate.
What impact is that having on schools, parents and pupils themselves, as many prepare for exams?

"Changing the rules by which nuclear power stations are judged to be safe or not may sound unpalatable to some, even outright dangerous. But this is what the Office of Nuclear Regulation is considering in order to extend the life of Britain’s ageing reactor fleet. Rest assured, however, such things are done carefully.  The adjustment would alter the level of graphite loss in the reactor core that is deemed safe. Several of the UK’s second generation Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor (AGR) power stations are due to close in the next few years. Graphite is a moderator and it is fundamental to the nuclear reaction in an AGR power station. Allowing those AGR plants with higher rates of graphite loss to continue generating power could cover the looming energy gap between supply and demand over the next ten years. The regulator insists it “would not allow continued operation of any nuclear reactor unless it was safe to do so”.  The AGR is a unique British concept. The 14 reactors provide roughly 15% of Britain’s electricity, but were built in the 1970s and 1980s and some are approaching 40 years old. While the UK has embarked on a process to construct new nuclear power stations, starting at Hinkley Point C near Bristol, these are still at least a decade away from being connected to the grid. In the absence of life extensions for the ageing AGRs, and possibly even with them, there are real concerns as to whether our electricity security can be assured.  Right now the UK has more than enough power stations, but as coal-fired plants close due to age or as emissions restrictions bite, this comfort is expected to erode unless for example new, gas-fuelled plants can fill the gap. Most renewables, such as wind or solar power, are not sufficiently reliable to ensure electricity supply at all times of high demand. This reveals extending the supply of nuclear power from existing sources to be both economically and socially important. It is also potentially highly profitable for the operator EDF, whose experts have argued that life extension is safe, but that is another story.  Graphite is a key component of the British AGR power stations. The age-related erosion and cracking of graphite in the reactor core represents a potentially life-limiting issue. Expert assessment and conservative judgement is required to determine whether allowing the reactors to keep running is a safe option for a nuclear power station beyond its licensed lifetime. Extending the life of a 40-year-old nuclear power station is not something that is done lightly.  Clearly graphite is not the only issue, it is merely one of many.    The US has benefited from extending its own ageing reactor fleet, but its light water reactor technology replaces the graphite moderator and carbon dioxide gas coolant of the AGR design with ordinary (“light”) water. So while the experience in the US shows the potential benefits of life extensions, the UK effort to extend the life of AGR reactors involves the exploration of much new territory. It is well known that the AGR fleet has had its difficulties – notoriously, Dungeness B took more than 23 years to complete. Nevertheless these machines are technologically impressive: operating at more than 600°C they are the highest temperature nuclear power stations in the world, making them (in a thermodynamic sense) among the most efficient generators of electricity.  The regulator is proud of its independence. In the face of nuclear anxieties after the disaster at the Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear plant in Japan, and conversely in the face of political pressure to help keep the lights on, it has a steady mission “to provide efficient and effective regulation of the nuclear industry, holding it to account on behalf of the public”. It is a most important role.  Amidst all the talk of graphite one risks missing another story from recent days concerning nuclear safety regulation. This other news concerns claims of conflicts of interest, with the same nuclear companies it regulates also providing the Office of Nuclear Regulation with technical advice. Given that public trust is so often an issue of trust in institutions and people, rather than in technologies or science, it is this other story that perhaps deserves to be getting more attention.  If the life extension of Dungeness B and other power stations are approved, then as electricity consumers, we should be pleased. What is vital to public confidence is honest and professional action by EDF as the operator and the Office of Nuclear Regulation as the independent safety regulator. If that is in hand, then there’s nothing in the recent talk of graphite that should give us particular cause to worry. "
