In introducing his Clean Power Plan on Monday, President Barack Obama used inspirational language to describe the impacts of limiting carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel‐​powered electric generating facilities. From mitigating climate change, to improving public health, from increasing jobs to lowering electric bills, from ensuring national security to leading to way into the future, the benefits seemed endless.



If this government program sounds too good to be true, it is. To say Obama oversold his plan is putting it gently.



When it comes to climate change, the Clean Power Plan is a non‐​starter. Climate change in the 21st century is going to be driven by carbon dioxide emissions from the world’s developing nations as they strive to meet the basic energy demands of their current and future populations — 1.3 billion of whom have no access to electricity at all, much less an adequate supply. In already developed nations, like the U.S. and Western Europe, where energy needs have largely been met, future projections don’t foresee significant emissions increases. Consequently, when it comes to future climate change, the contribution from developing nations will outweigh that from developed nations by about 10 to 1.



Even if we implement the Clean Power Plan to perfection, the amount of climate change averted over the course of this century amounts to about 0.02 C. This is so small as to be scientifically undetectable and environmentally insignificant. The plan will have little impact on warming, no impact on the future character of extreme weather events, and will it certainly do nothing on national security.





Creating jobs and stimulating economic activity by breaking windows is a readily falsifiable economic premise.



What about public health? Obama claimed this plan would drastically reduce “nationwide asthma rates,” among other impressive health benefits. In fact, the vast majority of the public health benefits touted by Obama are not a direct result of carbon dioxide emissions, but rather “co‐​benefits” from reductions of other substances that are emitted when fossil fuels are burned. And here’s the kicker: These pollutants are already being covered by existing Environmental Protection Agency regulations and so their control is not dependent on the Clean Power Plan. Essentially, the president is double‐​counting these benefits to make the Clean Power Plan seem better than it is.



If there are little no climate change benefits, then the president is effectively throwing a wrench in the nation’s current energy workings for no good reason. This forced retooling favors more expensive and less reliable renewables like wind and solar over cheap and abundant fossil fuels. It will be costly, both from an energy generating standpoint as well as from a grid restructuring standpoint. Creating jobs and stimulating economic activity by breaking windows is a readily falsifiable economic premise.



After stripping the layers of ineffectiveness from the Clean Power Plan, all that remains is Obama’s desire for his legacy to be defined by “doing something” about global warming. The president wants to show his resolve on the issue and lead the way during this December’s U.N. climate conference aimed at producing an international agreement to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, thereby mitigating climate change.



But the outlook for such an agreement, or rather the likelihood that it comes to fruition, is dim. Mounting scientific evidence suggests that the Earth’s climate is less sensitive to carbon dioxide increases than the models used to project the future account for, meaning the urgency and effectiveness carbon dioxide restrictions is diminished. So what’s left in store is increased energy prices in developed countries and prolonged the economic misery in developed ones. A lose‐​lose for everybody and a solution that proves worse than the problem itself.

Share this...FacebookTwitterCold weather is forecast to remain over much of Europe for the foreseeable future.
The 15-day forecast map for temperature at kachelmannwetter.com here shows what’s in store for Europe.

It tells us that the continent will likely end the year on a cold note after having experienced a very warm September. Already vast areas on Europe have seen snow this fall. Parts of Scandinavia are expected to be brutally cold over the next 2 weeks.
November 2016 0.5°C colder than mean
Meanwhile Germany’s DWD National Weather Service reports here that the month of November 2016 in Germany had a mean of 3.9°C, which makes it 0.5°C colder than the 1981-2010 mean.
When compared to the 1961-1990 period — a cold time when scientists were warning of a coming ice age — November 2016 was 0.1°C cooler. The results are preliminary, and I would expect it to be adjusted downward later, as the last 2 days were far below normal.
The low for the month of -12.0° was recorded in the East German hills known as the Erzgebirge on November 14.

Germany’s southeastern neighbor of Austria saw a November that was 0.5°C above the 1981-2010 mean, but far below the November mean of last year (+2.6°C) and the year earlier (+3.6°C), the Austrian ZAMG weather service reports.
Harsh winter even in Nice?
Two days ago the French-language nicematin.com reported here that scientists warn of a possible bitter cold winter ahead:
Attention, the heavy snow in Siberia late this autumn could have powerful consequences for Europe down to the Côte d’Azur, like the winter of 1985.”
Nicematin.com cites a report appearing at Bloomberg from last week, which featured renowned MIT climatologist Judah Cohen. Cohen is the father of the “Siberian Snow Theory” and argues: “the more snow covering the ground in northern Eurasia, the colder we can expect it down below. Sadly, Siberia is looking pretty white already,” Bloomberg writes.
Nicematin.com adds:
If his calculations are right, we have to expect a particularly rigorous 2016-2017 winter, and that down to our latitudes.”
Already we see that the weather crystal balls have been running at full power. The weeks and months ahead will tell us more about their accuracy.

"Philip Aiken has received more than 1.4m likes on the video-sharing app TikTok. But his videos don’t feature cute animals and there are no celebrities to be seen. Aiken’s posts are about soil restoration. The 27-year-old is one of a growing number of TikTok users discussing the benefits of boosting biodiversity in green spaces and gardens against a backdrop of viral sounds. “I see it as like planting seeds, and hopefully that germinates and that person wants to learn more,” says Aiken, known as Phil the Fixer on TikTok.Millennials and Generation Z are increasingly engaging with environmental issues by creating and sharing memes on social media. The hashtags “moss”, “biodiversity” and “native biodiversity” have 84.3 million, 12.6 million and nearly 800,000 views respectively on TikTok.   The most-viewed biodiversity TikToks poke fun at monoculture lawns, praise the qualities of moss, provide explainers, support indigenous practices and warn of mass extinction. TikTok has around 800m active users worldwide and is particularly popular with Generation Z: an estimated 60% of users were born after the mid-90s. The images and clips go on to reach new audiences when reposted on Twitter and Facebook. A subculture known as “grass TikTok” – which has gathered nearly 380 million views – has also emerged on the app. Its community interacts with content about plant species. Top creator Evan Phillips, who has more than half a million followers, rates different types of grass and posts pictures of fans’ gardens; he has even brought out grass-themed merchandise. Aiken downloaded the app in October 2019 after interviewing a group of youth climate activists – who were all talking about TikTok – for his podcast just to save the world. He regularly receives messages asking about gardening, sustainability and university degree choices, while others exchange resource recommendations in his comments section. Aiken, who is based in the US but studied for a master’s in renewable energy in New Zealand, hopes to become a teacher. “It’s been cool being able to influence the younger generation in that way,” he says.During lockdown, Aiken also co-founded EcoTok, a collective of young creators aiming to become the environmental “Hype House” (a group of the biggest stars on the app who live and film in a mansion in Los Angeles), as well as the Intersectional Environmentalist Instagram account, which was initially set up after a post by environmental activist Leah Thomas in response to the killing of George Floyd went viral. The Intersectional Environmentalist, which campaigns for an inclusive version of environmentalism, highlighting injustices experienced by marginalised communities, has now gained 121,000 followers, with an audience mainly made up of millennials.Young-Woong Kee, a 16-year-old Hawaiian high school student, is a keen follower of biodiversity TikToks: “Seeing them and talking about them with my friends has definitely impacted us and made us want to look more into it.” He has acquired a collection of succulents and hopes other viewers will look more deeply into wider environmental issues. Kee, who has also started watching National Geographic’s YouTube videos and the Netflix documentary series Our Planet, cited coral bleaching, deforestation and overhunting as key issues.A recent survey of Generation Z and millennials by Deloitte found climate change and protecting the environment was a top concern, both before and during the coronavirus pandemic. This follows the rise to prominence of Greta Thunberg and the growth of Fridays for Future, Zero Hour and Extinction Rebellion over recent years. Another EcoTok creator, Casey Shultis, 18, believes lockdown has further increased engagement. “People are sitting at home and now have the time to learn more about biodiversity and the environmental crisis,” he says. “I encourage people to understand the importance of planting native biodiversity while also seeing the beauty that comes along with it.” Shultis, who is about to start an environmental studies degree in the US, previously called his 62,300 TikTok followers the Greta Gang and hopes one day to have as much impact as Thunberg.  An Xiao Mina, author of the book Memes to Movements, says the full extent of the influence of these platforms will only become apparent by tracking the digital content over time. She highlighted the influence of, for example, #BlackLivesMatter and the Umbrella Movement in Hong Kong. “Often, the most visible thing is the meme,” says Mina. “What may not be apparent is the networks that are being built, the narratives being shaped and the organisational structures that ultimately might help us yield effective change.” Educators have also been using biodiversity memes to get their messages across in the classroom and lecture halls, while environmental organisations have been attempting to inspire younger audiences on social media, which can ensure the accuracy of information shared. The Royal Horticultural Society’s (RHS) Instagram following grew from 99,500 to 125,000 between April and June. Prof Alistair Griffiths, RHS Director of Science and Collections, says: “It would be wonderful if there were a way for RHS scientific content to be co-created with the key environmental influencers of TikTok.” However, the potential ban on TikTok in the US over national security concerns looms over creators, and could result in a loss of biodiversity engagement online. “It would be really unfortunate because TikTok is such a unique platform,” says Aiken. “People are genuinely learning things they never learned in school or from their communities.” But he remains optimistic. “There’s something different about Gen Z. I don’t necessarily think that’s gonna go away with TikTok.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"
"The Trump administration is proposing to make it easier for oil and gas companies to drill on US forest service lands. A proposed rule would eliminate key environmental reviews and public notice requirements, according to environmental advocates.  Currently, 2.7 % of the acreage of the national forest system has been leased by energy industries. An analysis by The Wilderness Society finds that the changes would make drilling more likely on more than 9m acres of land with high, medium or moderate development potential in Colorado, Montana, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah and Wyoming. Many of the forests are near tribal lands or include the traditional territories of indigenous peoples, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC). Western US forests could see the biggest changes, but the rule could also affect the east coast, where there is far less forest service land. Drilling within forests would require clearing trees for well pads and disrupting the ecosystem for roads and pipelines. Josh Axelrod, a senior advocate for NRDC who grew up in eastern Oregon said national forests are “where you go to be in the woods – to pick berries, or hunt mushrooms, or hunt game, or bike, or hike, or run, or ATV or off-road.” Aside from being critical for recreation, national forests are home to the drinking water supplies for tens of millions of Americans, and they help slow climate change and clean the air, Axelrod said. Oil and gas development, meanwhile, causes climate change. “We just don’t need to be looking for oil and gas in these landscapes at all,” Axelrod said."
"You’d be forgiven for thinking that businesses are racing ahead in the green transition. After all, big corporations like Sainsbury’s and Microsoft have made public announcements about going carbon neutral, or even carbon negative in the near future. But these commitments are more difficult for small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) to implement. Comprising fewer than 250 employees, they make up 99.9% of all businesses in the UK. Fully 96% have nine or fewer employees. They have fewer resources to carry out new policies and so are often left behind. SMEs might struggle to afford the upfront cost of installing renewable energy technologies like solar panels, and they might lack the time or personnel to find ways to reduce their energy use and emissions. This leaves them paying unnecessarily high energy bills or contributing more than their share of CO₂ emissions. This is not a fault of the policies themselves, but it does show the government’s lack of consideration of the challenges that small businesses face in trying to make the necessary changes. I study low carbon technology and help SMEs in Liverpool and Lancashire to implement it. These companies are hit by levies and tariffs that are meant to incentivise more sustainable practices, but many lack the time and resources to implement them. As a result, they’re penalised, which further limits their capacity to catch up. Over one-third of the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions come from heating buildings. Speedily deploying renewable heating – using technology like electric heat pumps – is essential for meeting the 2030 target of reducing emissions by 57% from 1990s levels. Why then do Energy Performance Certificate ratings continue to discourage customers from installing heat pumps? These ratings calculate how energy-efficient a building is to heat. Every home that is rented, sold or assessed is required to produce a certificate. Data about the building’s construction, such as the wall materials and levels of insulation, is fed into an algorithm that is supposed to help the government measure the progress of its energy-efficiency policies. But the underlying assumption within this algorithm is that electricity is more expensive than gas, and electric heating will greatly increase electricity use. There is some truth in that, but emissions from electricity generation will decrease as the electrical grid is decarbonised. Gas powered appliances meanwhile will always result in the same emissions. A plastic bag charge may seem like a simple method for reducing use. After all, people would prefer not to pay for something that they can bring from home. Still, there are worrying side effects to this policy. For instance, there are relatively higher emissions from the manufacture of single-use paper bags and an increase in heavier bags making their way to landfill because people are no longer reusing the flimsier free shopping bags for their bins. Instead, they’re buying rolls of heavy bin bags. Heavier loads on vans transporting rubbish means higher emissions.

      Are retailers 'bagging' the 5p plastic carrier bag charge?


 Businesses in the UK that produce packaging will also be hit with a levy after April 2022 if their products are not at least 30% recycled material. But what about businesses with a circular system which means they reuse their packaging and skip the heavily polluting recycling stage altogether? As it is, these businesses will face the levy too. A small business looking to be more sustainable would do well to ban paper communication. But there’s no guarantee that relying on emails is a big improvement. Most people don’t associate texts, emails and unnecessary attachments with a carbon cost, but our internet use also has emissions.  The Carbon Literacy project estimates that every spam email emits approximately 0.3g CO₂e (carbon dioxide equivalent). An email with “long and tiresome attachments” emits approximately 50g CO₂e. The average office worker produces 1.652kg CO2e per day in emails alone.  Installing energy-saving lightbulbs and energy efficient boilers will help a business reduce its emissions. But often the impact of energy use is eclipsed by something few people even count – the emissions from employees commuting to work every day. Setting up a work-from-home policy or arranging virtual meetings where possible would be a cheap and effective way for an SME to address their emissions quickly. For a big company like Sainsbury’s, pressuring local councils to make public transport more affordable and accessible would go even further to bring down emissions for local businesses and the wider community. To help businesses go zero carbon, or even carbon negative, policies must be adaptable and developed with community input. None of the policies I mention are innately bad – many of them quite work well in some places. But more important than any single policy is an overarching strategy to decarbonise society and the economy. Without monitoring the effects of each decision or making an effort to consider unintended consequences, governments can do more harm than good.

As Karl du Fresne [wrote recently](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/02/karl-du-fresne-on-new-zealands-new-elite/), former **New Zealand prime minister Helen Clark is a “leading global figurehead” of the new, leftist ruling class**. This ruling class is, as du Fresne notes, hypocritical and decidedly totalitarian: _They have a decidedly prudish streak when it comes to alcohol and think the state should be far more active in restricting what we can eat[…]A central article of faith with the elites is that ordinary people can’t be trusted to make the right decisions for themselves_.



In keeping with her busy-body, nanny-state globalism, Clark is behind a new “report” which wags its finger and sternly admonishes us to “think of the children!”



A major joint report by the WHO, UNICEF and the scientific journal The Lancet concludes the future of children around the world, including Australia, is being threatened by ecological degradation, climate change and predatory marketing practices that drive obesity.



Australia’s children were ranked 20th in the world on a ‘flourishing’ index, which takes into account poverty, health, education and protection from violence, but Australia’s performance on an index of sustainability was dire, with a rank of 174 out of 180 countries.



The poor sustainability rank was driven by high CO2 emissions per head of population, with the WHO estimating that Australia’s emissions would be 524 per cent above a global target by 2030.



So, real-world measures like poverty, health and education – none of that counts for anything compared to the globalists’ obsession with the invisible sky dragon.



After all, using **real data about actual things** would destroy the narrative: Australia is in the top 20 nations on the [Human Poverty Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Poverty_Index) (unlike New Zealand, despite having its very own [Minister for Child Poverty](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/08/the-axe-of-child-poverty-looms-over-ardern/) in the prime minister’s chair, no less), [health](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-24/spain-tops-italy-as-world-s-healthiest-nation-while-u-s-slips) (where Australia is in the top 10, 11 places ahead of New Zealand) or [education ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_Index)(despite falling standards, Australia still leads the UN’s own Education Index – with New Zealand in third place).



Perhaps Clark is just embarrassed that the nation she used to lead, and now run by her acolyte, is doing so poorly compared to the so-called “deniers” in Australia? But wait: Australia has reduced its CO2 emissions by 13%, while climate-loving New Zealand has increased its by 4%.



All said, Helen Clark’s former realm is not pulling its weight in the brave new globalist world. What else is an elite panjandrum to do, but fudge the numbers and try and baffle the peanut gallery with bullshit?



The report says if global warming exceeds 4 degrees Celsius by the year 2100 in line with current projections, “it would lead to devastating health consequences for children, due to rising ocean levels, heatwaves, proliferation of diseases like malaria and dengue, and malnutrition.”



[…]Co-chair of the Commission, former New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark, said children were facing future “existential threats”.



“Despite improvements in child and adolescent health over the past 20 years, progress has stalled, and is set to reverse,” Ms Clark said. “Every child worldwide now faces existential threats from climate change and commercial pressures.



Clark is channelling the bullying child-ignoramus who became the globalist patron saint, and shrieking, “How dare you!”



But, as **Michael Reagan** once said, “Invoking ‘the children’ is pure BS. It’s obvious political BS.” Political BS, though, is the globalists’ stock-in-trade – none less than Helen Clark.



 **And this report is A-grade, rolled-gold bullshit.**



Note the core argument: **if global warming exceeds 4 degrees Celsius by the year 2100**.



There is absolutely no reason to think that this is at all likely. The “4­°C” claim is predicated on an absolute-worst-case scenario that, as other scientists point out, assumes a chain of events which are individually all at the extreme end of probability. The likelihood that **all of them** will combine to produce an absolute-worst-case is ridiculously remote.



The central premise of Clark’s argument is garbage. Any conclusions drawn from a garbage premise will, logically, also be garbage.



 **Globalist finger-wagger Clark’s “report” is rank garbage of the lowest order.**

Last week Conor Clarke at The Atlantic blog , apparently as part of a running argument with Jim Manzi, raised four substantive issues with my study, “What to Do About Climate Change,” that Cato published last year. Mr. Clarke deserves a response, and I apologize for not getting to this sooner. Today, I’ll address the first part of his first comment. I’ll address the rest of his comments over the next few days.   
  
  
Conor Clarke: 



(1) Goklany’s analysis does not extend beyond the 21st century. This is a problem for two reasons. First, climate change has no plans to close shop in 2100. Even if you believe GDP will be higher in 2100 with unfettered global warming than without, it’s not obvious that GDP would be higher in the year 2200 or 2300 or 3758. (This depends crucially on the rate of technological progress, and as Goklany’s paper acknowledges, that’s difficult to model.) Second, the possibility of “catastrophic” climate change events — those with low probability but extremely high cost — becomes real after 2100.



Response: First, I wouldn’t put too much stock in analyses purporting to extend out to the end of the 21st century, let alone beyond that, for numerous reasons, some of which are laid out on pp. 2–3 of the Cato study. As noted there, according to a paper commissioned for the Stern Review, “changes in socioeconomic systems cannot be projected semi‐​realistically for more than 5–10 years at a time.”   
  
  
Second, regarding Mr. Clarke’s statement that, “Even if you believe GDP will be higher in 2100 with unfettered global warming than without, it’s not obvious that GDP would be higher in the year 2200 or 2300 or 3758,” I should note that the conclusion that net welfare for 2100 (measured by net GDP per capita) is not based on a belief. It follows inexorably from Stern’s own analysis.   
  
  
Third, despite my skepticism of long term estimates, I have, for the sake of argument, extended the calculation to 2200. See here. Once again, I used the Stern Review’s estimates, not because I think they are particularly credible (see below), but for the sake of argument. Specifically, I assumed that losses in welfare due to climate change under the IPCC’s warmest scenario would, per the Stern Review’s 95th percentile estimate, be equivalent to 35.2 percent of GDP in 2200. [Recall that Stern’s estimates account for losses due to market impacts, non‐​market (i.e., environmental and public health) impacts and the risk of catastrophe, so one can’t argue that only market impacts were considered.]   
  
  
The results, summarized in the following figure, indicate that even if one uses the Stern Review’s inflated impact estimates under the warmest IPCC scenario, net GDP in 2200 ought to be higher in the warmest world than in cooler worlds for both developing and industrialized countries.   






Source: Indur M. Goklany, “Discounting the Future,” _Regulation_ 32: 36–40 (Spring 2009).   
  
  
The costs of climate change used to develop the above figure are, most likely, overestimated because they do not properly account for increases in future adaptive capacity consistent with the level of net economic development resulting from Stern’s own estimates (as shown in the above figure). This figure shows that even after accounting for losses in GDP per capita due to climate change – and inflating these losses — net GDP per capita in 2200 would be between 16 and 85 times higher in 2200 that it was in the baseline year (1990). No less important, Stern’s estimate of the costs of climate change neglect secular technological change that ought to occur during the 210‐​year period extending from the base year (1990) to 2200. In fact, as shown here, empirical data show that for most environmental indicators that have a critical effect on human well‐​being, technology has, over decades‐​long time frames reduced impacts by one or more orders of magnitude.   
  
  
As a gedanken experiment, compare technology (and civilization’s adaptive capacity) in 1799 versus 2009. How credible would a projection for 2009 have been if it didn’t account for technological change from 1799 to 2009?   
  
  
I should note that some people tend to dismiss the above estimates of GDP on the grounds that it is unlikely that economic development, particularly in today’s developing countries, will be as high as indicated in the figure. My response to this is that they are based on the very assumptions that drive the IPCC and the Stern Review’s emissions and climate change scenarios. So if one disbelieves the above GDP estimates, then one should also disbelieve the IPCC and the Stern Review’s projection for the future.   
  
  
Fourth, even if analysis that appropriately accounted for increases in adaptive capacity had shown that in 2200 people would be worse off in the richest‐​but‐​warmest world than in cooler worlds, I wouldn’t get too excited just yet. Even assuming a 100‐​year lag time between the initiation of emission reductions and a reduction in global temperature because of a combination of the inertia of the climate system and the turnover time for the energy infrastructure, we don’t need to do anything drastic till after 2100 (=2200 minus 100 years), unless monitoring shows before then that matters are actually becoming worse (as opposing merely changing), in which case we should certainly mobilize our responses. [Note that change doesn’t necessarily equate to worsening. One has to show that a change would be for the worse. Unfortunately, much of the climate change literature skips this crucial step.]   
  
  
In fact, waiting‐​and‐​preparing‐​while‐​we‐​watch (AKA watch‐​and‐​wait) makes most sense, just as it does for many problems (e.g., some cancers) where the cost of action is currently high relative to its benefit, benefits are uncertain, and technological change could relatively rapidly improve the cost‐​benefit ratio of controls. Within the next few decades, we should have a much better understanding of climate change and its impacts, and the cost of controls ought to decline in the future, particularly if we invest in research and development for mitigation. In the meantime we should spend our resources on solving today’s first order problems – and climate change simply doesn’t make that list, as shown by the only exercises that have ever bothered to compare the importance of climate change relative to other global problems. See here and here. As is shown in the Cato paper (and elsewhere), this also ought to reduce vulnerability and increase resiliency to climate change.   
  
  
In the next installment, I’ll address the second point in Mr. Clarke’s first point, namely, the fear that “the possibility of ‘catastrophic’ climate change events — those with low probability but extremely high cost — becomes real after 2100.”

"Extinction Rebellion plan to block streets in London, Manchester and Cardiff next week as they call on MPs to back a climate emergency bill and hold a national citizens’ assembly on the crisis. On Tuesday, five XR groups will block roads leading to parliament as they descend on Westminster to demand MPs back what they call the climate and ecological emergency bill, which they say would speed up the UK’s progress on reducing its carbon emissions.  “The focus will, I think, more than it has been before, be on those institutions of power,” said Anneka Sutcliffe, an XR action coordinator. “We’re really hoping to have a big show of solidarity, especially on that first day around parliament, and then over the course of a couple of weeks we’re hoping to build pressure with our actions.” The group is also planning a number of protests over the bank holiday weekend and beyond, with banner drops, sit-ins, marches, picnics and roadblocks taking place around the country. The lineup includes a “mad hatter’s tea party” at Gatwick airport to protest against the aviation industry’s carbon footprint, and a plan to block Prince Street bridge in Bristol with a giant elephant. In Birmingham on Friday, more than 150 activists attended Eastside City Park and marched to the headquarters of HS2 to demonstrate against its construction. Many dressed up as wildlife to highlight the biodiversity lost as a result of tree felling from builders.“I don’t think it’s right to call a project sustainable after you cut 108 ancient woodlands,” said Verel Rodrigues, 25, part of Midlands Extinction Rebellion and one of the organisers of Stop HS2, “I just don’t see how this project is viable and how they can push this green-washing agenda to everyone.” Verel, a previous mechanical engineering student, was a supporter of HS2 after meeting a director of HS2 at his university, but soon became disillusioned. “I found research explaining how the project wouldn’t be carbon-neutral for 120 years. When I saw that I was shocked, because this is something HS2 has never told anyone about. “I fell for that, unfortunately, and it was only in February this year when I started to realise how bad HS2 was that I started to raise awareness and get involved with the campaign,” he said.  In Wales there are plans to protest outside the Senedd and in Cardiff Bay over rising sea levels, while in Manchester protesters will occupy a space in the city centre. There will also be a national day of action focused on HS2 on 4 September, with protests in London, Manchester and along the planned rail line. A previous rebellion planned for April was cancelled because of the coronavirus pandemic, and XR said it was encouraging all protesters to maintain social distancing, wear gloves and a mask, and bring hand sanitiser. An online event dubbed Digital Rebellion will take place for those who would prefer to get involved from home. Paul Stephens, part of XR’s police liaison team, said the group had received a letter from police warning them that organisers of gatherings of more than 30 people risked a £10,000 fine under coronavirus restrictions. “It’s a vague threat over coming out to protest about such a serious thing as extinction,” he said. “It’s playing a political game. We’re going to challenge that as we go forward.” The group said it hoped to avoid relations with police breaking down like they did in October 2019 when XR protests were banned in London. On Wednesday one of XR’s co-founders, Roger Hallam, was part of a group detained and charged with conspiracy to cause criminal damage. Since founding XR, Hallam has formed a separate direct action group called Beyond Politics. He was remanded in custody until 22 September along with four others, three of whom were definitely connected to XR, a group spokeswoman said."
"Be careful what you wish for.
Deep in their hearts, a large and growing number of people all around the world are coming to the conclusion that runaway global warming is very unlikely. However a disturbing number seem to think “OK, but even if all of this proposed legislation has no climate benefits, it may curb our extravagant consumption, reduce pollution and bring us a more sustainable lifestyle.”

The Week That Was: 2016-01-30 (January 30, 2016) Brought to You by SEPP (www.SEPP.org) The Science and Environmental Policy Project
 
THIS WEEK: By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP)
IPCC v. Nature: The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is the self-proclaimed body of experts on climate change. As previously stated in TWTW, the independent Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC) comes to drastically different conclusions regarding future climate change. The IPCC claims that climate change since about 1950 is largely human caused, with human emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) primarily responsible. Using research and data the IPCC largely ignores, the NIPCC claims that recent global climate change (as opposed to local and regional) is largely natural, and there is little or no physical evidence that climate is changing beyond natural occurrences.
One of the most dramatic statements made by the IPCC appeared in its Fourth Assessment Report (AR-4, 2007) which claimed the glaciers in the Himalaya Mountains will disappear by 2035, depriving hundreds of millions of people their primary source of water, the rivers the run off the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau.
Alarmed, the government of India, Ministry of Environment and Forests had its glacial expert, Mr. V.K. Raina, Executive Director General of the Geological Survey of India (GSI) prepare a report based on decades of on-the-ground observations. Fear of the possible melting of the glaciers has been expressed for about 100 years resulting in scientific efforts to recognize and examine the fluctuations at the front-snout of glaciers, starting in the early part of the 20th century, although some studies go back 150 years.
Overall, there is a net decrease in mass balance in the 20th century, though some glaciers are increasing in mass balance. This net decrease in mass balance is within the boundaries of prior interglacial warm periods over the last two million years, the period identified as the Pleistocene (major ice age). According to the report, some glaciologists believe that there may have been as many as 21 glacial cycles during this period.
In short, the net decrease in mass balance appears to be part of a natural cycle, not human caused global warming. Of course, the advance and retreat of Himalayan glaciers need to be monitored, but there is no indication that they will vanish by 2035.
The report was independently reviewed by glacial expert, Professor Cliff Ollier of Australia, who reviewed the research for the Indian government. The then-chairman of the IPCC, Rajendra Pachauri, dismissed this work, based on empirical research, as “voodoo science”. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy – IPCC AR-4

IPCC v. IPCC: Using 20 General Circulation Models used by the IPCC, researchers from China, Sweden, and South Korea evaluated the forecasts of these models for the Tibetan Plateau until 2070. The plateau lies north of the Himalayan range and south of the Takiamakan Desert. It is the headwaters for six major river basins: Yellow, Yangtze, Salween, Mekong, Indus, and Brahmaputra, which flows into the Ganges. The researchers found that the water supply is unlikely to decline until at least 2070. The abstract states:
“The impacts of future climate change on water balance for the headwater basins of six major rivers in the Tibetan Plateau are assessed using the well-established VIC-glacier land surface hydrological model driven by composite projections of 20 CMIP5 GCMs under scenarios RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5. At the plateau scale, the annual precipitation is projected to increase by 5.0–10.0% in the near term (2011–2040) and 10.0–20.0% in the long term (2041–2070) relative to the reference period 1971–2000. The annual temperature is projected to increase for all the scenarios with the greatest warming in the northwest (2.0–4.0 °C) and least in the southeast (1.2–2.8 °C). The total runoff of the study basins would either remain stable or moderately increase in the near term, and increase by 2.7–22.4% in the long term relative to the reference period, as a result of increased rainfall-induced runoff for the upstream of the Yellow, Yangtze, Salween, and Mekong and increased glacier melt for the upper Indus. In the upper Brahmaputra, more than 50.0% of the total runoff increase is attributed to the increased glacier melt in the long run. The annual hydrograph remains practically unchanged for all the monsoon-dominated basins. However, for the westerly-controlled basin (upper Indus), an apparent earlier melt and a relatively large increase in spring runoff are observed for all the scenarios, which would increase water availability in the Indus Basin irrigation scheme during the spring growing season.”
 
Thus, we see that the dramatic assertion in IPCC AR-4 that the glaciers of the Himalayan range will melt by 2035, causing severe hardships to those who depend on these rivers is not even supported by the IPCC’s models.
In general, TWTW discounts long-term projections/forecasts from un-validated climate models. But, this research underlines the great inconsistency between the IPCC models and its assertions. Clearly, a rigorous scientific audit of IPCC reports is needed, but unlikely to occur in the near future. As reported in the January 9 TWTW, according to the web site of the US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), the US Department of State is the largest financial contributor to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and to the IPCC. This Administration has based its legacy, in part, on “fighting” climate change, based on highly questionable science from the IPCC and the USGCRP.
In addition, two of the US EPA’s pillars of evidence of its endangerment finding that human emissions of carbon dioxide endanger human health and welfare are the science (questionable) and the global climate models. These pillars conflict with themselves. Thus, the EPA’s Endangerment Finding and the Administration’s actions based on it, including its energy plan, are self-contradicting.

*****************
Power Trap – UK: The UK Institute of Mechanical Engineers has issued a report warning the government of a looming electricity gap in the UK between electricity generated and that required to satisfy consumption. The Institute estimates that this gap may be between 40% and 55% of electricity demanded within 10 years, 2025. There are multiple causes for this potential gap, but they can be summed as self-inflicted policy disasters. These disasters can be politely described as fads. One should note, that the report of the Institute refers to carbon dioxide as a pollutant, which has not been empirically demonstrated.
The primary issue is the phase-out of coal-fired power plants, to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, as required by the UK’s Climate Change Act of 2008 to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 80% by 2050, and a host of associated policy actions. The 2008 act was prompted by the 2007 IPCC report using questionable science, as discussed above. This effort has been complicated by a phasing out of nuclear power.
To its misfortune, the UK appeared to rely on wind as the substitute for coal-fired power plants, but is discovering that wind power is costly and unreliable. The government is reducing or ending subsidies and tax relief for such activities.
The Institute of Mechanical Engineers proposes that about 30 combined-cycle gas turbine (CCGT) plants are needed to fill the gap. CCGT plants are highly efficient by combining gas-fired turbines with steam turbines. However, the report suggests building 30 CCGT power plants in ten years is unrealistic due to time and skilled-manpower constraints. Among other things, the report recommends cutting consumption, including increasing efficiency, and more research on renewables, energy storage, combined heat and power and power station design. The source of the natural gas is another matter, particularly the hostility big green has demonstrated towards hydraulic fracturing of dense shale in the UK. See links under Energy Issues – Non-US
*****************
Administration’s Plan: The looming electricity crisis in the UK, coupled with the high costs of electricity in Denmark and Germany, should give pause to any endorsement of the US Administration’s power plan, which demands the phase out of coal, and largely relies on wind and solar to fill the needs of consumers. (In Germany, large subsidies are given to companies that are threatening to move to avoid the high electricity costs.). It is becoming clear that the chief executive, and his appointed executives, are unmoved by any hardships their policies cause.
In Congress, Senator Inhofe, the chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, has made it clear that he considers climate goals of the agreement reached in Paris are not legally binding and that the United States and other countries have no reason to stick to their promises. It is unlikely that the remainder of the President’s term will be graceful. See links under Criticizing Paris! The Administration’s Plan, and The Administration’s Plan – Push-Back and the January 23 TWTW Number of the Week.

A New Nature Trick? Nature magazine published Mr. Michael Mann’s famous hockey-stick. The paper contradicted a great deal of existing information, relied upon a statistical method that produced a hockey-stick shape from random noise, and required the removal the end of a time series of data that contradicted the hypothesis. The removal of the data became known as Mann’s Nature Trick from Phil Jones of the Climatic Research Unit, who supported it. The hockey-stick was featured in the IPCC’s Third Assessment Report. Eventually, it was demolished by statistical experts, but has never been retracted.
Mr. Mann and Nature are at it again, publishing a statistical analysis on the likelihood of the recent warming. His co-authors include Stephen Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact. According to the Abstract, they attempt to calculate the probability of the recent warming without human influence by examining it with data over the past 150 years. In this they use: “a semi-empirical approach that combines the latest (CMIP5) climate model simulations with observations of global and hemispheric mean temperature.” Many scientists point out that the 150 years of surface data record is far from complete and it does not address past warming and cooling periods that can be found in the geological and other historic records. As such, the calculations have little meaning.
Statistician William Briggs writes that the paper has at least four errors: 1) Measurement error, 2) probability has bearing on cause, 3) does not establish a cause of the sequence, 4) it shows a fit to past data; not prediction. This is also called “curve fitting.” The ability to predict accurately is the central issue.
Climate scientist Judith Curry has a separate analysis produced for the Examiner newspaper. Her analysis includes comments by Nicholas Lewis. She concludes that the paper is a giant exercise in circular reasoning and gives five assumptions that must be made: 1).Assume that the global surface temperature estimates are accurate; ignore the differences with the satellite atmospheric temperatures; 2) Assume that the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble can be used to accurately portray probabilities; 3) Assume that the CMIP5 models adequately simulate internal variability; 4) Assume that external forcing data are sufficiently certain; and 5) Assume that the climate models are correct in explaining essentially 100% of the recent warming from CO2. See links under Oh Mann!
*****************
Genetic Fallacy: Briggs presents a new term for a fallacy that can be considered related to argumentum ad hominem – discrediting the person rather than the argument. Briggs calls it the genetic fallacy, which is committed when a proposition is accepted or rejected because of its origin, history, who speaks it, or who paid for it to be spoken. ”This person works for the EPA, therefore, whatever he says is biased by government. (or … whatever he says is true).” See link under http://wmbriggs.com/post/7763/
*****************
Carbon Tax: Robert Murthy of the Institute for Energy Research takes the New York Times to task for its arguments supporting the proposed carbon tax, which used British Columbia as an example of a successful tax. He writes:
“In light of writings such as these, it is quite deceptive to claim that a revenue-neutral carbon tax would “work” in the United States. Just look at what happened in California to the “dedicated” uses of their cap-and-trade revenue.
“The American public is being sold a bill of goods regarding a carbon tax. On the one hand, proponents tell progressive citizens about all the “green” goodies that can be funded with the trillions in revenue that such a tax will bring in. On the other hand, supporters assure conservative citizens not to worry, that the tax will be revenue neutral and will allow for huge cuts in the corporate income tax rate.”
Another example is the temporary telephone tax. In 1898 the federal government implemented the “luxury” (excise) tax on telephones to pay for the Spanish-American War, which ended in 1898. The tax was repealed in 1902, then reenacted for World War I. It was partially repealed in 2006 but not fully repealed. See link under Cap-and-Trade and Carbon Taxes
*****************
Number of the Week: 17.8 inches – Maybe! Last weekend’s snow storm produced strange results. Many measurements in the region showed about 2 feet, 24 inches. But the official Washington, DC measurement, taken at Reagan National Airport, showed 17.8 inches. Initially, one may expect a lower amount due to the proximity to the tidal Potomac River or to the Urban Heat Island Effect. According to Patrick Michaels and Chip Knappenberger, the officials at Reagan National, who measure snow depth, lost their measuring device, called a “snow board”, during the storm. It was buried in the snow. One could say they were out of their depth. See link under Measurement Issues.

“It is extraordinary that in their various releases neither the UK Met Office nor the IPCC seem to want to confront these statistical facts in their own data. It is of course unwise to make a projection into the future but if we trust neither the elaborate computer climate models favoured by the Met Office nor the projection of Mills- type all-stochastic models this is all we have got. One can only note that in the 85 years from now to 2100 the projected increase could be around 0.0087 x 85 = 0.74 degrees. Could this be realistic and if so is that a cause for alarm? I only ask.”

“The data reveal a continual rippling of temperatures in two layers of the atmosphere called the mesosphere and the lower thermosphere, from as low as -122 degrees Celsius to as high as 32 degrees Celsius ( -189 degrees Fahrenheit to 90 degrees Fahrenheit). At 97 kilometers (60 miles) high, the temperature swings reach 38 degrees Celsius (100 degrees Fahrenheit).”

An Open Request to Resources for the Future (RFF)
By Robert Bradley Jr. Master Resource, Jan 27, 2016
https://www.masterresource.org/resources-for-the-future-rff/request-rff/
[SEPP Comment: According to the essay, RFF should: 1. Recognize the physical science of climate change as highly unsettled and thus open to contrary public policy positions; 2. Recognize the benefits, the positive externalities, associated with the anthropogenic influence on climate; and 3. Impute government failure in both the problem and the solution, not only alleged market failure, in cost/benefit analysis. This appears to be sound advice to all institutions attempting to give opinions on the subject.]

A Supreme Court Victory for Climate and Free Markets
By Editorial Board, Bloomberg View, Jan 26, 2016
http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2016-01-26/a-supreme-court-victory-for-climate-and-free-markets
“In a victory for both environmental and free-market principles, the Supreme Court has just made it easier for the U.S. to cut carbon emissions. Its decision rests on the proposition that the laws of supply and demand can be used to address climate change.
“…the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which regulates wholesale power markets, issued a rule in 2011 saying that demand-response companies, which negotiate agreements with large electricity consumers to cut their use when necessary, should be paid the same amount of money per megawatt as traditional electricity generators. That rule is critical to enticing consumers to take part.”

1. Climate Change: The Burden of Proof
By S. Fred Singer, American Thinker, Jan 29, 2016
http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/01/climate_change_the_burden_of_proof.html
SUMMARY: IPCC has yet to provide proof for significant human-caused climate change; their climate models have never been validated and are rapidly diverging from actual observations. Anyway, the real threat to humanity comes not from any (trivial} greenhouse warming but from cooling periods creating food shortages and famines.

A blizzard! The hottest year ever! More signs that global warming and its extreme effects are beyond debate, right? Not even close.

Link to paper: A review of uncertainty in in situ measurements and data sets of sea surface temperature
By John Kennedy, Review of Geophysics, Jan 24, 2014
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2013RG000434/abstract
SUMMARY: Michaels writes: “An East Coast blizzard howling, global temperatures peaking, the desert Southwest flooding, drought-stricken California drying up—surely there’s a common thread tying together this “extreme” weather. There is. But it has little to do with what recent headlines have been saying about the hottest year ever. It is called business as usual.
 
“Surface temperatures are indeed increasing slightly: They’ve been going up, in fits and starts, for more than 150 years, or since a miserably cold and pestilential period known as the Little Ice Age. Before carbon dioxide from economic activity could have warmed us up, temperatures rose three-quarters of a degree Fahrenheit between 1910 and World War II. They then cooled down a bit, only to warm again from the mid-1970s to the late ’90s, about the same amount as earlier in the century.
 
“Whether temperatures have warmed much since then depends on what you look at. Until last June, most scientists acknowledged that warming reached a peak in the late 1990s, and since then had plateaued in a “hiatus.” There are about 60 different explanations for this in the refereed literature.”
This changed when NOAA made questionable changes to the historic record. (See above link to the Kennedy paper) coupled with a massive El Niño warming.
“There are two real concerns about warming, neither of which has anything to do with the El Niño-enhanced recent peak. How much more is the world likely to warm as civilization continues to exhale carbon dioxide, and does warming make the weather more “extreme,” which means more costly? 
 
“Instead of relying on debatable surface-temperature information, consider instead readings in the free atmosphere (technically, the lower troposphere) taken by two independent sensors: satellite sounders and weather balloons. As has been shown repeatedly by University of Alabama climate scientist John Christy, since late 1978 (when the satellite record begins), the rate of warming in the satellite-sensed data is barely a third of what it was supposed to have been, according to the large family of global climate models now in existence. Balloon data, averaged over the four extant data sets, shows the same. 
 
“It is therefore probably prudent to cut by 50% the modeled temperature forecasts for the rest of this century. Doing so would mean that the world—without any political effort at all—won’t warm by the dreaded 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100 that the United Nations regards as the climate apocalypse.
 
“The notion that world-wide weather is becoming more extreme is just that: a notion, or a testable hypothesis. As data from the world’s biggest reinsurer, Munich Re, and University of Colorado environmental-studies professor Roger Pielke Jr. have shown, weather-related losses haven’t increased at all over the past quarter-century. In fact, the trend, while not statistically significant, is downward. Last year showed the second-smallest weather-related loss of Global World Productivity, or GWP, in the entire record.
 
“Without El Niño, temperatures in 2015 would have been typical of the post-1998 regime. And, even with El Niño, the effect those temperatures had on the global economy was de minimis.”

3. Obama Administration Proposes Cutting Methane Waste from Oil, Natural Gas Production
Rules are aimed at cutting the oil and gas industry’s methane emissions by as much as 45% from 2012 levels
By Amy Harder, WSJ, Jan 22, 2016
http://www.wsj.com/articles/obama-administration-proposes-cutting-methane-waste-from-oil-natural-gas-production-1453478550
SUMMARY: “The Interior Department proposed rules Friday to cut methane emissions from oil and natural gas operations on federal lands, the latest move in President Barack Obama’s climate change agenda.
 
“The rules are aimed at helping meet an administration goal of cutting the oil and gas industry’s emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, by as much as 45% from 2012 levels over the next decade.
 
“The regulations, set to be completed later this year after a public comment period, would include the first-ever federal limits on flaring, a process in which excess gas, whose primary component is methane, is burned off as carbon dioxide. The rules also include a requirement that companies regularly inspect for methane leaks.
“With the onset of the energy boom, some companies have taken to flaring or venting gas, emitting the methane itself straight into the atmosphere, if pipelines or other infrastructure aren’t immediately available to transport and process it. The new rules would require energy companies to capture the methane and ship it as fuel.
“The Environmental Protection Agency is working to implement final rules for cutting carbon emissions from power plants, and it is expected to issue final rules soon requiring new carbon standards for big trucks.
 
“The EPA is also set to issue separate completed rules requiring cuts to methane emissions from new oil and gas wells throughout the country, not just on federal lands—rules that industry executives say makes Friday’s proposal unnecessary.
 
“The department also says the new rule would allow the government to reap as much as $16 million in additional royalty payments from gas that companies currently flare or vent instead of selling. That amounts to 0.5% of the $3 billion in royalties the government says it collects from drilling on public lands.”
[SEPP Comment: Flaring is necessary if there are no pipelines to take the gas. The regulations are designed to increase the costs of fossil fuels to consumers without any real benefits.]

By Larry Kummer. From the Fabius Maximus website.
Summary: The vital public policy debate over climate change is deadlocked. This is the sixth in a series about ways to restart the debate — and resolve it. This post gives Milton Friedman’s advice about using predictions as the gold standard for validation of theories. This implies that the key to policy action is testing climate models, the only means to give a majority of the public confidence in their forecasts.
“For such a model there is no need to ask the question ‘Is the model true?’. If ‘truth’ is to be the ‘whole truth’ the answer must be ‘No’. The only question of interest is ‘Is the model illuminating and useful?’”
— G.E.P. Box in “Robustness in the strategy of scientific model building” (1978). He also said “All models are wrong; some are useful.”

The debate about public policy for climate change has deadlocked. There are many factors at work, but two stand out as unnecessary problems — as “own goals” by scientists. First they didn’t provide information about data and methods to their opponents (there are always opponents to such large public proposals). Second they didn’t provide compelling proof that climate models’ predictions are reliable — often ignoring the large literature about validation of theories and models.
This series suggests that we restart the debate by better using our knowledge about the methodology of science — especially about models, the embodiment of theories. Box’s insight above applies strongly to debates about policy, where decision-makers are seldom masters of the subject — and so must rely on scientists’ insights.
Previous chapters looked at suggestions about testing models from Paul Krugman, Daniel Davies, and Karl Popper. This post examines a seminal essay by Milton Friedman about the use of theories. Like Karl Popper, he sees predictions as the gold standard for validation of theories. Theories’ value lies in their ability to make accurate predictions, not the degree of their fidelity to nature. That is, abstractions and simplifications are useful if they improve predictions; additional complexity or detail is not useful if it fails to enhance predictions.
Friedman was discussing economics, but these excerpts apply with equal force to climate science.

“The Methodology of Positive Economics“
by Milton Friedman
From Essays in Positive Economics (1966)
Excerpts. Headers and red emphasis added.
Defining Terms
In The Scope and Method of Political Economy (1891) … John Neville Keynes distinguishes among “a  positive science … a body of systematized knowledge concerning what is; a normative or regulative science…  a body of systematized knowledge discussing criteria of what ought to be … a system of rules for the attainment of a given end”; and comments that “confusion between them is common and has been the source of many mischievous errors”.
The vital role of positive science in public policy debates
… Any policy conclusion necessarily rests on a prediction about the consequences of doing one thing rather than another, a prediction that must be based – implicitly or explicitly – on positive economics.
… differences about economic policy among disinterested citizens derive predominantly from different predictions about the economic consequences of taking action – differences that in principle can be eliminated by the progress of positive economics – rather than from fundamental differences in basic values, differences about which men can ultimately only fight.
Testing theories
… The ultimate goal of a positive science is the development of a “theory” or, “hypothesis” that yields valid and meaningful (i.e., not truistic) predictions about phenomena not yet observed.
… Viewed as a body of substantive hypotheses, theory is to be judged by its predictive power for the class of phenomena which it is intended to “explain.” Only factual evidence can show whether it is “right” or “wrong” or, better, tentatively “accepted ” as valid or “rejected.” As I shall argue at greater length below, the only relevant test of the validity of a hypothesis is comparison of its predictions with experience.
The hypothesis is rejected if its predictions are contradicted (“frequently” or more often than predictions from an alternative hypothesis); it is accepted if its predictions are not contradicted; great confidence is attached to it if it has survived many opportunities for contradiction. Factual evidence can never “prove” a hypothesis; it can only fail to disprove it, which is what we generally mean when we say, somewhat inexactly, that the hypothesis has been “confirmed” by experience.
To avoid confusion, it should perhaps be noted explicitly that the “predictions” by which the validity of a hypothesis is tested need not be about phenomena that have not yet occurred, that is, need not be forecasts of future events; they may be about phenomena that have occurred but observations on which have not yet been made or are not known to the person making the prediction.
… Evidence cast up by experience is abundant and frequently as conclusive as that from contrived experiments; thus the inability to conduct experiments is not a fundamental obstacle to testing hypotheses by the success of their predictions. But such evidence is far more difficult to interpret. It is frequently complex and always indirect and incomplete. Its collection is often arduous, and its interpretation generally requires subtle analysis and involved chains of reasoning, which seldom carry real conviction. … It renders the weeding-out of unsuccessful hypotheses slow and difficult. They are seldom downed for good and are always cropping up again.
The value of theories
… the relevant question to ask about the “assumptions” of a theory is not whether they are descriptively “realistic,” for they never are, but whether they are sufficiently good approximations for the purpose in hand. And this question can be answered only by seeing whether the theory works, which means whether it yields sufficiently accurate predictions.
Conclusion
Economics as a positive science is a body of tentatively accepted generalizations about economic phenomena that can be used to predict the consequences of changes in circumstances.
—————————- End excerpt —————————-
What can we get from Friedman’s insights?
Friedman has lessons for both sides in the climate wars. Many skeptics have unrealistic expectations for models, which this essay can help reset.
More important for the policy debate is Friedman’s emphasis on validated predictions, something potentially of great power in the public policy debate — but which climate scientists have largely ignored (preferring hindcasts and appeals to authority).
Friedman specifically refutes the common rebuttal by climate scientists — that they cannot test climate models’ forecasts vs. future data. He says that forecasts can be validated by “observations … not known to the person making the prediction“. Climate scientists can test the models used in the past IPCC Assessment Reports by running them with current data — not vs. scenarios, as originally done, but vs. observations made after their publication.
About Milton Friedman
Milton Friedman (1912 – 2006) was an American economist. He received the 1976 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. See his Wikipedia entry for more information about his work.
Friedman was an advisor to Republican U.S. President Ronald Reagan and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, advocating for policy emphasis on free markets with minimal intervention. He considered his role in eliminating conscription in America as his proudest achievement. In Capitalism and Freedom (1962) he recommended adoption of a volunteer military, floating exchange rates, abolition of medical licenses, a negative income tax, and school vouchers (he founded the Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice) — far he’s 2 for 5.
For another perspective on Friedman’s essay see Julian Reiss’ excellent review. See a preview of Capitalism and Freedom here.

We’ve already seen how **Greta Thunberg** and her little pals reduced an historic village green to a muddy wasteland when they gathered to shake their little fists and screech “how dare you!” at all and sundry.



Well, how dare **they**?



The residents of Bristol are angry at popular eco-activist Greta Thunberg after her supporters ruined the city’s historic green.



Tens of thousands of people attended a climate change rally where Thunberg gave a speech before leading a march around Bristol. 



In rainy weather, much of the grass where people stood turned into mud.



I think [@GretaThunberg](https://twitter.com/GretaThunberg?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) should be paying to repair this. It’s her spouting nonsense that caused it.



Greta’s marching morons aren’t the only green eco-warriors destroying the planet in order to save it. Anyone who’s ever seen a green protest site in Tasmania would be well aware of the squalor and rubbish littering the forest in their wake. Bulldozers were needed to clear up the tons of garbage left behind by environmental protesters at Standing Rock. Climate Strike marches are notorious for the pile of rubbish left behind.



 **But the damage that green activism does on the larger scale is less easily noticed – yet it is far, far more destructive.**



The same activists who leave literal crap all over Tasmania’s forests are utterly silent while dozens of threatened wedge-tail eagles are slaughtered by nearby wind farms.



The [British] government is trying to get onshore windfarms going again, defying the damage they do to unique environments. I am perplexed by how its zero-carbon policies can be reconciled with its wider economic aims of ‘levelling up’ or of fostering a beautiful environment. It is an odd fact that Greens can be extremely hostile to the natural world when it gets in their way. Announcing the above story, the BBC’s environment analyst, **Roger Harrabin** , informed listeners that the wind turbines could go on ‘empty moorland’ in Scotland and Ireland. Empty? A friend points out that such moors contain ‘snipe, golden plover, red grouse, merlin, pippits, skylarks, short-eared owls, wheatears, stonechat, wrens and curlew’ and there will be ‘several varieties of heather, honeydew, tormentil, rowan, eyebright, many moths and dragonflies, bees, common lizard, mountain hare, red deer and much more’



The green fetish for trees can also be horrific for the environment. In Australia, green activism has seen dense eucalypt forests proliferate, and piles of flammable undergrowth turn forests into powder-kegs. Britain has fared little better at the hands of environmentally ignorant greens.



Another Green idea, uncritically received, is that we should rush around planting trees everywhere. **Dr Tony Whitbread** , the president of the Sussex Wildlife Trust, recently published a counterblast to all this sylvamania. ‘Enormous ecological damage was done in the mid-20th century by tree-planting’, particularly in the Flow Country of north-east Scotland, he warns. In a century, Sussex has lost 80 per cent of its heathlands, half of them to trees. ‘Chalk grassland can have about 40 species of sensitive plant per square metre; this reduces to a small number of common species if scrub invades or trees are planted.’ It is ‘nonsense’ that ‘a dense canopy of trees is the natural state of our country’. There are too many eco-babes lost in our woods.



Who cares, so long as a few wealthy greenies get to feel their warm glow of smugness as they drive their Tesla to their next Extinction Rebellion protest?

"A number of famous novelists, poets and playwrights including Margaret Atwood and Zadie Smith have lent their support to an Extinction Rebellion campaign against the political influence of rightwing thinktanks fighting against climate action. On Wednesday evening the Writers Rebel group will demonstrate outside 55 Tufton Street in London, a venue known to host meetings of thinktanks and lobbying outfits linked to climate science denial and the oil industry.  These include the the Global Warming Policy Foundation, the most prominent climate sceptic group in the UK, and free market thinktank the Centre for Policy Studies, whose deputy chair is Sir Graham Brady, chair of the influential 1922 Committee of backbench Conservative MPs. A group of 20 high-profile writers will attend the event, including White Teeth author Zadie Smith, who said: “The heroes of this historical moment are climate activists: they are trying to save us all – primarily from ourselves. Anything the rest of us can do to acknowledge, support or further their work, we should try to do.” She will be speaking at the event, while The Handmaid’s Tale author Atwood lent her support via video message. “Climate change due to human activity is not a theory, it is not an opinion, it is a fact,” she said. “Denial of this fact in the interests of big money will lead to our extinction as a species.” Other attendees will include writer and activist George Monbiot, and Sir Mark Rylance, actor and first artistic director of Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre. At the launch of the campaign last week, writer and actor Stephen Fry said people had a duty to “expose the lies” of climate change denial. “It’s sickening how much money is being spent on thinktanks and professional lobbyists to spread confusion, lies and doubt on the subject of man-made climate change and its horribly real threat,” he said. “These people and their huge corporations funding them are utilising exactly the same playbook that big tobacco used to sow doubt and confusion over the clear scientific evidence that emerged about smoking.” The demonstration is being organised in conjunction with with the nascent Extinction Rebellion group Money Rebellion, which will target the finance industry for its inaction on the climate emergency. Gail Bradbrook, co-founder of Extinction Rebellion, said: “The current economic system we have is killing life on earth and we desperately need a grown up conversation about something different. “Bodies like [thinktank] the Institute of Economic Affairs won’t reveal their funders and yet are often given airtime to advocate for free market fundamentalism, as if it is a law of nature. “We want a citizens’ assembly to rewire our economic system so that it stops harming and starts repairing the damage done.” The event is taking place as part of XR’s 10-day protest to demand government action on the climate crisis, during which dozens have already been arrested."

Back in the summer of 2015, I sent Dr. Tom Peterson of NOAA/NCEI a private email saying that I’d lost my trust in him as an unbiased scientist and that this Karl et al. “pause buster” paper (of which Peterson did most of the work since Karl is just an administrator) would be his “Waterloo”.
It seems that with the publication of a paper (In Nature no less) saying Karl et al. is wrong by some big names in climate science last week (including Mann of all people) and now this, my prediction is coming closer to reality.
Did White House Collude With NOAA Over Temperature Adjustments?

Republicans in the US House of Representatives are expanding their request for documents related to a major climate study by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). In a 22 February letter to NOAA, Congressman Lamar Smith, the Texas Republican who leads the House science committee, expressed disappoint with the “slow pace and limited scope” of NOAA’s response to his initial request. “The speed with which NOAA has conducted these searches and produced documents creates the perception that the Agency is deliberately attempting to impede and hinder the Committee’s oversight,” he wrote. Smith is now asking that NOAA provide his committee documents from other agency officials and offices, including chief scientist Richard Spinrad. Smith has asked the agency to deliver all documents by 29 February. — Jeff Tolleson, Nature, 26 February 2016
The study of the warming hiatus is cutting-edge climate science not the “settled science” of the greenhouse effect and mankind’s input of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere. The hiatus is good for science. It tells us about natural climate variability of which our knowledge is still very limited. It holds valuable scientific information and in climate science, with it huge political and economic implications, we need all the information we can get. There are over 40 explanations for the warming hiatus proposed by scientists from small volcanoes, ocean movements, effects in the stratosphere, data gathering problems and many more. They can’t all be right, [but] they are all a valuable contribution to a scientific mystery. It shows us that the real science is not settled. And another thing. About those sceptics who are seeking to deny and undermine climate science. It was the sceptics, not the scientists, who discovered the hiatus, this so-called biggest problem in climate science. –David Whitehouse, The Spectator, 25 February 2016

Were any Obama administration officials communicating with NOAA prior to issuing press releases? The House Committee’s investigation should provide insight into the following questions that deserve answers. To what extent did internal discussions occur about the more questionable choices made in adjusting the ocean temperature data? Was any concern raised about the discrepancies of the new ocean temperature data set and NOAA’s other ocean temperature data set (OISST) that shows no warming since 2003? Were any Obama administration officials communicating with NOAA about these statements prior to issuing press releases? Was the release of the land and ocean temperature data sets, which were documented in papers previously published, delayed to follow Karl’s June press release? –Judith Curry, Fox News, 5 November 2015

Archaeologists have discovered fossil evidence of a caveman having eaten an entire rattlesnake, fangs and all. Even in these polarizing times, most people would agree that meals getting easier to swallow since the Stone Age represents a positive change. But not everyone.



Paul Ehrlich, the infamous overpopulation alarmist who bet economist Julian Simon that a growing population would lead to resource scarcity (and lost), is still fearmongering. Instead of overpopulation, his latest book project decries, bizarrely, what he considers to be the pathetic size of modern jawlines. Along with coauthor Sandra Kahn, an orthodontist, he argues that modern postindustrial lifestyles have led humans to develop smaller jaws with a higher likelihood for crooked teeth due to dental overcrowding.





Ehrlich believes that population growth and the associated rise in consumption must lead to environmental collapse, exhaustion of natural resources, food shortages, and mass starvation. The data suggest otherwise.



Ehrlich may very well be right about changes in the size of human jawlines. But if he is — so what?



Because people no longer spend long periods of time having to chew tough, uncooked food that they personally scavenged and hunted, their jaws have not had to work as hard as their ancestors’ did. The ready availability of cheap, softer foods, the theory goes, has led jawlines to shrink. (It has also brought hunger to an all‐​time low).



“We know from fossil evidence that hunter‐​gatherers had big, well‐​developed jaws,” Ehrlich told Stanford News. “I’ve never seen a hunter‐​gatherer skull with crooked teeth,” he recalls a paleontologist colleague telling him. The Stanford University biologist criticizes baby food manufacturers for producing soft mushy foods that prevent infants from choking and suggests that parents instead feed their babies, from the moment they are weaned, tough foods that require intense chewing. This, he theorizes, would encourage stronger jaw development.



Fortunately, crooked teeth can be corrected with braces. Most people would likely agree that having to hunt and gather all of one’s meals and give up the comforts of the modern age in exchange for perfectly straight teeth would be a bad deal. “The stakes aren’t as high as with something like climate disruption, which could lead to billions of premature deaths,” claims Ehrlich to Stanford News. “But _Jaws_ describes an epidemic that is causing a lot of expense — think braces — and misery.”



In his strange quest to bemoan ever more aspects of the modern life, Ehrlich seems to be once again over‐​reaching with this one. Braces just aren’t that bad. But at least this project momentarily distracted Ehrlich from his far more harmful alarmism about overpopulation.



Ehrlich’s decades of overpopulation fearmongering have led to far more human misery than braces ever have. In the 1970s, Ehrlich helped bring Malthusian overpopulation hysteria back into vogue. His ideas helped to legitimize human rights abuses around the world, including millions of forced sterilizations in Mexico, Bolivia, Peru, Indonesia, Bangladesh, and India, as well as China’s cruel one‐​child (now two‐​child) policy.



Ehrlich still believes that population growth and the associated rise in consumption must lead to environmental collapse, exhaustion of natural resources, food shortages, and mass starvation. The data suggest otherwise. In fact, population growth actually goes hand in hand with increasing abundance.



The authors of _The Simon Project_ calculate that the planet’s resources became 380% more abundant between 1980, the year of Simon and Ehrlich’s wager, and 2017, even as the world population grew dramatically. Over the past 37 years, every additional human born on the planet, regardless of the size of their jawlines, seems to have made resources proportionately more plentiful for the rest of humanity. The world is now experiencing “superabundance,” meaning that the cost of commodities is decreasing even faster than population is growing.



The data show that the modern age is actually pretty great — and that’s something to chew on.

"Only one in 10 of the world’s electric utility companies are prioritising investment in clean renewable energy over growing their capacity of fossil fuel power plants, according to research from the University of Oxford. The study of more than 3,000 utilities found most remain heavily invested in fossil fuels despite international efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and some are actively expanding their portfolio of polluting power plants. The majority of the utility companies, many of which are state owned, have made little change to their generation portfolio in recent years. Only 10% of the companies in the study, published in the research journal Nature Energy, are expanding their renewable energy capacity at a faster rate than their gas- or coal-fired capacity. Of the companies prioritising renewable energy growth, 60% have not stopped concurrently expanding their fossil fuel portfolio and only 15% of these companies are actively reducing their gas and coal capacity. Galina Alova, the author of the report, said the research highlighted “a worrying gap between what is needed” to tackle the climate crisis and “what actions are being taken by the utility sector”. The report found 10% of utilities were favouring growth in gas-fired power plants. This cluster is dominated by US utilities, eager to take advantage of the country’s shale gas reserves, followed by Russia and Germany. Only 2% of utilities are actively growing their coal-fired power capacity ahead of renewables or gas. This cluster is dominated by Chinese utilities – which alone contributed more than 60% of coal-focused companies – followed by India and Vietnam. The report found the majority of companies prioritising renewable energy were clustered in Europe. Many of the industry’s biggest players are investing in low-carbon energy and green technologies to replace their ageing fossil fuel power plants. In the UK, coal plants are shutting at pace ahead of the government’s 2025 ban on coal-fired power in part because the UK’s domestic carbon tax on power plants make them uneconomic to run. “Although there have been a few high-profile examples of individual electric utilities investing in renewables, this study shows that overall, the sector is making the transition to clean energy slowly or not at all,” Alova said. “Utilities’ continued investment in fossil fuels leaves them at risk of stranded assets – where power plants will need to be retired early – and undermines global efforts to tackle climate change.” "
"

Falling back on tired scare tactics, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency administrator Gina McCarthy today announced carbon dioxide emissions limits for new power plants as part of the President Obama’s Climate Action Plan. From McCarthy:   




The overwhelming judgment of science tells us that climate change is real, human activities are fueling that change, and we must take action to avoid the most devastating consequences. We know this is not just about melting glaciers. Climate change—caused by carbon pollution—is one of the most significant public health threats of our time. That’s why E.P.A. has been called to action. And that’s why today’s action is so important for us to talk about.



I humbly disagree both as to the “public health threat” of carbon dioxide emissions from human activities, as well as with the idea that the EPA can do anything to alleviate whatever climate change may result.   
  
What the new emissions limits do is to basically force the administration’s preference for natural gas over coal as the fossil fuel source for our nation’s electricity production going forward, perpetuating the administration’s seeming “War on Coal.” It does this by setting the carbon dioxide emissions limits for new power plants such that they are impossible to meet by burning coal, but can be met readily by burning natural gas. The reason for this is simple chemistry: the act of burning coal releases nearly twice the amount of carbon dioxide as does burning natural gas per unit of energy released.   
  
The funny thing is, the market was already moving in that direction. Cheap natural gas is displacing coal for generating electricity, which in turn is reducing our national carbon dioxide emissions.   




So there was no need for the administration to get involved. Government intervention in the markets does not have a particularly positive track record, so there is no reason to have optimism that this government meddling in the energy market will have a positive outcome—especially when the science does not support the need for action in the first place. I have detailed all of this before.   
  
Today’s announcement from the EPA is not a welcomed one for free markets, and undoubtedly it will be vigorously challenged.   
  
What I wrote previously about this sort of action is worth repeating:   




Taken together, declining U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and declining estimates of climate change should have been enough to convince the president that things were already on the proper track—no government intervention necessary.   
  
But this administration is characterized by intervening where it is not necessary. The president’s Climate Action Plan is more of the same.

As I’ve [written several times before](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/the-astonishing-denialism-of-climate-believers/), climate alarmists show an alarming tendency to be absolutely convinced about things which are not only completely false but easily shown to be so. Media climate alarmists more than anyone.



Not only have the legacy media almost completely surrendered to hysterical group-think but they’ve completely abandoned the most basic function of journalism: the rigorous pursuit of the facts. Instead, the legacy media are wall-to-wall “feelpinions”.



Perhaps the worst, at least in the antipodes, is that endlessly infuriating excrudescence of _bien pensant_ leftist banality, _The Project_ , and its [perpetually irritating](https://twitter.com/monster_dome/status/1106498367620681728) poster-boy, **Waleed Aly**.



There is stiff competition, especially from the public broadcasters, to provide the most woke and deceptive take on these issues. But no television program is more relentlessly woke, driven by feelpinions and committed to fake news than Channel 10’s The Project.



[…]Last week host Waleed Aly filed a report from Germany, portraying Europe’s largest economy as a renewable energy and climate action nirvana, contrasting it to Australia’s climate inaction dystopia, or some such.



As is his standard, Aly got nearly everything wrong.



Let’s start with this claim Germany is “about to” shut down brown-coal mining — in fact its aim is to close it down by 2038. On that basis Aly is “about to” turn 60 years old[…]



While Germany has stopped mining black coal, it still imports the stuff and burns it. A Deutsche Bank report on German energy imports notes that coal imports in 2018 were 39 per cent higher than 2000 levels.



In fact, no matter what its “aims”, there should be little confidence that Germany actually **will** close down either mining or burning coal in the near future. In fact, its coal use has **increased** since 2008.



Which brings us to other energy imports; oil remains Germany’s largest, but it is challenged now by natural gas which is increasingly being used for home heating and electricity generation. The country’s electricity supplies are also supplemented by imported nuclear energy.



Even Germany’s “renewables” are doing little to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions. **One of its key renewables is “biomass”: a fancy euphemism for burning wood.** Which is even dirtier and far more inefficient than coal.



Germany hasn’t even been able to meet its vaunted “climate targets”.



Germany[…]according to a McKinsey study of its energy transition, won’t meet its 2020 targets. “If the pace of emission reduction from the past decade continues, Germany will hit its 2020 targets eight years late, and will only meet those for 2030 in 2046,” says the report.



So, still burning coal, burning wood and failing to even meet its own climate commitments. And, for all that, Germans are paying through the nose for less and less reliable power.



“The German power grid repeatedly faced critical situations in June of (2019): significant shortfalls in available power were detected on three separate days,” said McKinsey, explaining the situation will worsen[…]



“Today the electricity price for households is still about 45 per cent above the European average,” says the McKinsey report[…]International data site, Globalpetrolprices.com, shows German electricity prices are the highest of the major world economies.



So Waleed Aly and _The Project_ got almost everything wrong about facts which are easily verified with a few minutes’ internet searches. Yet this ignorant, fraudulent wokester has the chutzpah to sneer at Australia’s “political culture”.



This farrago of false opinion and fake news is supposedly the best the legacy media have to offer. Let the legacy media get their own house in order before they wag their fingers at anyone else.



But, hey, what would I know? I’ve never been hugged by Jacinda Ardern.

"“Let’s get her some sex. ” Susan Silver says that was one of her chief contributions as a writer on “The Mary Tyler Moore Show. ” Playing the beloved young housewife Laura Petrie a few years earlier, Ms. Moore and her TV husband, Dick Van Dyke, had been made to sleep in separate beds. But it was the 1970s now. Even good girls had sex. Ms. Silver and the other women writing for “The Mary Tyler Moore Show” made sure of it. [ Read Mary Tyler Moore’s obituary | How she changed fashion ] As Ms. Moore’s new sitcom character, the independent, single career woman Mary Richards, put it in one episode: “I’m hardly innocent. I’ve been around. Well, all right I might not have been around. But I’ve been nearby. ” Ms. Silver said there was no particular feminist agenda for the show. There was, however, an   number of female writers on it  —   well over a dozen in the show’s   run that started in 1970. They were encouraged, she said, to write from their own experience, and to let Mary Richards’s   derive “organically. ” That made “The Mary Tyler Moore Show” a laboratory for the social issues of the day, which in some cases were being reflected for the first time on   television. Sex, birth control, equal pay, workplace sexism, homosexuality  —   all took a turn on the show, and not from the bully pulpit but from the “girl” who could turn the world on with her smile. Here’s how they played: When Lou Grant (Ed Asner) interviews Mary Richards for an associate producer job in his Minneapolis TV newsroom, he asks questions that women in the workplace often got asked but that weren’t necessarily legal: How old are you? Are you married? Divorced? What religion are you? She calls him out but answers anyway, in the show’s first episode. The point was not belabored but Mary Richards slept with her boyfriends. A   Chicago journalist had suggested that Mary, who was 30 when the series began, was “undersexed,” Ms. Silver said, and so in Season 3, Ms. Silver wrote an episode in which Mary asked her friend Rhoda if that was the case. A few episodes later, Mary goes on a date and comes home the next morning in the same dress. “Men across the country wrote to the show in despair over the betrayal of their trust and admiration,” Jennifer Keishin Armstrong wrote in her 2013 book, “Mary and Lou and Rhoda and Ted: And All the Brilliant Minds That Made ‘The Mary Tyler Moore Show’ a Classic. ” The third season featured another   handled in a    way. Mary’s friend Phyllis (Cloris Leachman) tries to push her brother into Mary’s arms, but the brother (Robert Moore) is more taken with Phyllis’s archnemesis, Rhoda (Valerie Harper). Phyllis works herself into a lather over this development, until Rhoda puts her out of her misery. “He’s not my type,” she reassures Phyllis, who remains skeptical. No really, Rhoda says. “He’s gay. ” Mr. Moore himself was gay, and he embraced the late decision to out the character this plainly, Ms. Armstrong writes in her book, especially since all the laughs were directed at his clueless TV sister. Had the Pill ever been mentioned in a sitcom script before “Mary Tyler Moore”? If so, the moment has been lost to history. Not long after the   episode, Mary’s father, at loose ends after his retirement, is visiting Mary for dinner at her apartment. Mary’s mother, making her exit, turns at the door. “Don’t forget to take your pill!” she calls out. “I won’t,” father and daughter answer in unison. Cut to the comically guilty look on Mary’s face. The Pill had won federal approval in 1960, but it was only that year, 1972, that a Supreme Court decision had made it available to unmarried women. And Mary was unmarried, for all seven seasons. Early hopes to make her a divorcée from the outset were instantly quashed by queasy executives. “It used to be I felt I could be myself. Now I feel I represent women everywhere. ” The third season opens with Mary kvetching to Rhoda as she prepares for a meeting at the TV station, where she resents the station manager “trotting in groups of people and saying, ‘This is our woman executive. ’” Her views take on a slightly different cast when she discovers that she makes $50 a week less than the man who had her job before her. She confronts Lou, asking him why. “Because he was a man,” Lou says. “The Dick Van Dyke Show” ended just four years before “The Mary Tyler Moore Show” made its premiere, even though it seemed the two shows were worlds apart. Ms. Moore broke ground in the earlier show, too, though. When the script called for her to vacuum in skirt and heels, she put her foot (in ballet flat) down and her Capri pants on. “We got the absolution of men everywhere,” she told TV Guide a few years ago, “and women kind of breathed a sigh of relief, too, and said: ‘Hey, that’s right. That’s what we wear. ’”"
"**A number of pro-democracy lawmakers in Hong Kong were dragged out of the chamber during a row about a Chinese national anthem bill.**
The bill would criminalise disrespect of the anthem.
Legislators were arguing over the leadership of a key committee, which would affect the bill's progress.
One of the lawmakers carried out, Eddie Chu, told the BBC: ""If Hong Kong was a democracy, we would not need to start scuffles like this.""
He added: ""Unfortunately we are forced into this situation. I can foresee more fights within the chamber and outside the chamber.""
The chaotic scenes highlight the deep divisions in Hong Kong, which is a special administrative region of China.
Although last year's street protests died down during the pandemic, some demonstrations are expected to resume.
It's the second time in recent days there have been scuffles in the Legislative Council.
The Legislative Council was in dispute over who should run the house committee, which scrutinises bills and decides when they are voted on.
Last week, the council president appointed Chan Kin-por, a pro-Beijing lawmaker, to oversee the election of a new leader.
On Monday - before the Legislative Council began - Mr Chan was in the chairman's seat, surrounded by more than 20 security guards.
As pro-democracy lawmakers entered the room, they tried to reach the seat, but were stopped by the guards.
As the guards used blankets to corral the protesters, others pointed and yelled from their seats.
One lawmaker held a sign that said: ""CCP [Chinese Communist Party] tramples HK legislature.""
During the melee - which went on for several minutes - at least one person fell to the ground, apparently injured.
At one point, a lawmaker took a running jump to try to reach the chairman's bench, but was stopped in mid-air by guards.
After most of the pro-democracy lawmakers left - or were removed - the pro-Beijing Starry Lee was elected chairwoman of the house committee.
This, her opponents fear, will make it easier for the national anthem bill to be passed.
**Lam Cho Wai, BBC News Chinese, Hong Kong**
China wants a controversial bill that would criminalise abuse of China's national anthem to get passed as soon as possible.
But the house committee - responsible for scrutinising controversial bills, including the national anthem one - has failed to select a chairperson for months.
The city will elect new lawmakers in September. Democrats want to delay the bills to next term.
Beijing has accused the pro-democracy camps of ""malicious"" filibustering, effectively paralyzing the legislature.
What happened inside the chamber is another sign that China continues to tighten its grip on Hong Kong.
It is very similar to what happened last year - when the pan-democrats failed to stop the controversial extradition bill in the LegCo, which sparked months of mass protests.
Some smaller-scale protests and clashes have come back to the city recently, and are expected to gain much more momentum after the pandemic.
But there has been no sign that China, or Hong Kong's leadership, will make any concession.
Hong Kong has its own national football team, but not its own anthem - so the Chinese one is played before games.
In recent years, the anthem has been booed more frequently before matches, including before a game with Iran in September.
In 2017, China's parliament, the National People's Congress, extended a law on disrespecting the anthem to Hong Kong - but it has not yet been adopted there.
During the protests last year, a song called Glory to Hong Kong became an unofficial anthem of the protesters."
"Most people in the UK are committed meat eaters – but for how long? My new research into the views of meat eaters found that most respondents viewed veganism as ethical in principle and good for the environment.  It seems that practical matters of taste, price, and convenience are the main barriers preventing more people from adopting veganism – not disagreement with the fundamental idea. This could have major implications for the future of the food industry as meat alternatives become tastier, cheaper and more widely available. My survey of 1,000 UK adult men and women found that 73% of those surveyed considered veganism to be ethical, while 70% said it was good for the environment. But 61% said adopting a vegan diet was not enjoyable, 77% said it was inconvenient, and 83% said it was not easy.  Other possible barriers such as health concerns and social stigma seemed not to be as important, with 60% considering veganism to be socially acceptable, and over half saying it was healthy.  The idea that most meat eaters agree with the principles of veganism might seem surprising to some. But other research has led to similar conclusions. One study for example, found that almost half of Americans supported a ban on slaughterhouses.  The prevalence of taste, price, and convenience as barriers to change also mirrors previous findings. One British survey found that the most common reason by far people gave for not being vegetarian is simply: “I like the taste of meat too much.” The second and third most common reasons related to the high cost of meat substitutes and struggling for meal ideas.  These findings present climate and animal advocates with an interesting challenge. People are largely aware that there are good reasons to cut down their animal product consumption, but they are mostly not willing to bear the personal cost of doing so.  Decades of food behaviour research has shown us that price, taste and convenience are the three major factors driving food choices. For most people, ethics and environmental impact simply do not enter into it.  Experimental research has also shown that the act of eating meat can alter peoples’ views of the morality of eating animals. One study asked participants to rate their moral concern for cows. Before answering, participants were given either nuts or beef jerky to snack on.  The researchers found that eating beef jerky actually caused participants to care less about cows. People seem not to be choosing to eat meat because they think there are good reasons to do so – they are choosing to think there are good reasons because they eat meat.  In this way, the default widespread (and, let’s be honest, enjoyable) behaviour of meat eating can be a barrier to clear reasoning about our food systems. How can we be expected to discuss this honestly when we have such a strong interest in reaching the conclusion that eating meat is okay?  Fortunately, things are changing. The range, quality, and affordability of vegan options has exploded. My survey was conducted in September 2018, a few months before the tremendously successful release of Greggs’ vegan sausage roll.  Since then, we have seen an avalanche of high-quality affordable vegan options released in the British supermarkets, restaurants and even fast food outlets. These allow meat eaters to easily replace animal products one meal at a time. When Subway offers a version of its meatball marinara that is compatible with your views on ethics and the environment, why would you choose the one made from an animal if the alternative tastes the same?  The widespread availability of these options means that the growing number of vegans, vegetarians and flexitarians in the UK have more choice than ever. Not only will this entice more people to try vegan options, but it will make it far easier for aspiring vegetarians and vegans to stick to their diets.  With consumer choice comes producer competition, and here we will see the magic of the market. If you think those looking to cut down their meat consumption are spoilt for choice in 2020, just wait to see the effect of these food giants racing to make their vegan offerings better and cheaper as they compete for a rapidly growing customer segment.  We may be about to witness an explosion in research to perfect plant-based meat analogues. Meanwhile, the development of real animal meat grown from stem cells without the animals is gaining pace.  While these replacements get tastier, more nutritious and cheaper over the next ten years, meat from animals will largely stay the same. It is no wonder the animal farming industry is nervous. Demand for meat and dairy is falling drastically while the market for alternatives has skyrocketed.   In the US, two major dairy producers have filed for bankruptcy in recent months, while a recent report estimated that the meat and dairy industries will collapse in the next decade.  This leaves the average meat eater with a dilemma. Most agree with the reasons for being vegan but object to the price, taste, and convenience of the alternatives.  As these alternatives get cheaper, better and more widespread, meat eaters will have to ask themselves just how good the alternatives need to be before they decide to consume in line with their values. Being one of the last people to pay for needless animal slaughter because the alternative was only “pretty good” will not be a good look in the near future."
"The Carbon Sense Coalition today called on the Australian Federal Parliament to stop playing Global Warming politics and focus instead on the irresponsible damage being contemplated by the Cap-N-Tax promises.
In testimony this week to the New Zealand Parliamentary Enquiry into the ETS, the Chairman of Carbon Sense, Mr Viv Forbes, said that it was impossible to achieve the gigantic cuts in carbon dioxide emissions suggested by various western governments without a crash program of Carbon Capture and Burial (CCB). He expanded on those comments today: 
“There is no evidence that CCB would provide any climate or environmental benefits whatsoever – just a huge misuse of investment capital and a massive increase in the cost of living for any society silly enough to tread this path.”

By Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt
(German text translated/edited by P Gosselin)
The climate discussion between the two different fronts had ground to a halt for a long time. Nobody wanted to or could talk to the other. Luckily that has improved a bit as of late. Potsdam scientist Stefan Rahmstorf, a hardcore follower of the extreme climate-alarmism line, has addressed the topics of our “Die kalte Sonne” book twice, and just recently at Realclimate.
That’s welcome as it shows that a sort of  discussion is taking place. Of course it still remains disappointing when one closely follows the line of argumentation by “stefan”.
His chart with the solar curve is purposely started AFTER the strong increase in solar activity during the first half of the 20th century, thus hiding the enormous increase from those who read quickly. He lets his temperature curve abruptly end at the highest point of the El Nino, even though at the time of publication on 14 November 2016 the El Nino event had been completely over and the temperature has since returned to normal values. Here the Potsdam scientist craftily selects a 12-month smoothing. More transparent would have been a 36-month smoothing. So, what remains is the monkey business of making sure to profit as much as possible from the recent El Nino. From a climate point of view, it makes absolutely no sense. Thus it’s little wonder that fellow scientists are increasingly distancing themselves from Rahmstorf.
Another example is the harsh cold that gripped Germany just a few years ago and so obviously did not fit at all the global warming climate narrative. Rahmstorf quickly concocted an explanation and claimed with as much media fanfare as possible that the cold winters were related to disappearing Arctic sea ice – and so ultimately were connected to climate warming.
Papers dismiss Potsdam cold winter – Arctic sea ice theory

The concept was immediately dismissed by the climate warming establishment as we reported here. A group led by Kelly McCusker also dismissed it in a paper published in October 2016 in Nature Geoscience. The scientists modelled the Central Eurasian winter temperatures for the past 600 years and were unable to find a relationship with sea ice. The cold waves have much more to do with climate internal fluctuations.
The scientists write in the abstract:
Twenty-five winters of unexpected Eurasian cooling unlikely due to Arctic sea-ice loss
Surface air temperature over central Eurasia decreased over the past twenty-five winters at a time of strongly increasing anthropogenic forcing and Arctic amplification. It has been suggested that this cooling was related to an increase in cold winters due to sea-ice loss in the Barents–Kara Sea. Here we use over 600 years of atmosphere-only global climate model simulations to isolate the effect of Arctic sea-ice loss, complemented with a 50-member ensemble of atmosphere–ocean global climate model simulations allowing for external forcing changes (anthropogenic and natural) and internal variability. In our atmosphere-only simulations, we find no evidence of Arctic sea-ice loss having impacted Eurasian surface temperature. In our atmosphere–ocean simulations, we find just one simulation with Eurasian cooling of the observed magnitude but Arctic sea-ice loss was not involved, either directly or indirectly. Rather, in this simulation the cooling is due to a persistent circulation pattern combining high pressure over the Barents–Kara Sea and a downstream trough. We conclude that the observed cooling over central Eurasia was probably due to a sea-ice-independent internally generated circulation pattern ensconced over, and nearby, the Barents–Kara Sea since the 1980s. These results improve our knowledge of high-latitude climate variability and change, with implications for our understanding of impacts in high-northern-latitude systems.”
And how did the German media take on the important result? Just a few years ago they had energetically reported on the Rahmstorf model. Sad: In the press pure silence reigned.
Also another paper by Chafik et al. is important here. It appeared in October 2016 in the Geophysical Research Letters. Also here the natural cycles of the North Atlantic climate was again shown — and negated the relationships between the Arctic sea ice melts and the European cold waves:
Global linkages originating from decadal oceanic variability in the subpolar North Atlantic
The anomalous decadal warming of the subpolar North Atlantic Ocean (SPNA), and the northward spreading of this warm water, has been linked to rapid Arctic sea ice loss and more frequent cold European winters. Recently, variations in this heat transport have also been reported to covary with global warming slowdown/acceleration periods via a Pacific climate response. We here examine the role of SPNA temperature variability in this Atlantic-Pacific climate connectivity. We find that the evolution of ocean heat content anomalies from the subtropics to the subpolar region, likely due to ocean circulation changes, coincides with a basin-wide Atlantic warming/cooling. This induces an Atlantic-Pacific sea surface temperature seesaw, which in turn, strengthens/weakens the Walker circulation and amplifies the Pacific decadal variability that triggers pronounced global-scale atmospheric circulation anomalies. We conclude that the decadal oceanic variability in the SPNA is an essential component of the tropical interactions between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.”

"WASHINGTON  —   Senate Democrats have one particular judge’s name in mind as they await the identity of President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee: Merrick B. Garland. Democrats and their allies remain furious that Senate Republicans refused to even consider Judge Garland, President Barack Obama’s nominee to the high court, with 10 months remaining in Mr. Obama’s second term. That deep resentment is certain to color their handling of Mr. Trump’s choice just as it has contributed to their resistance to moving quickly on Mr. Trump’s cabinet selections. All indications are that they see the forthcoming nomination as a chance to take a strong stand against the new president, since they still have the power to filibuster a Supreme Court choice  —   at least for now. “I haven’t seen the names,” said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont and a veteran of multiple Supreme Court fights. “But when they had a consensus person with Merrick Garland, every single Republican who raised their hand and solemnly swore before God to uphold the Constitution refused to follow the Constitution and even have a hearing. ” Top Democrats say they don’t intend to play “tit for tat” with the nomination. But they say they will insist on what they consider to be a mainstream candidate capable of securing at least the 60 votes needed to thwart any filibuster. Otherwise, they promise to do whatever they can to block the nominee. “We are not going to do what the Republicans did,” said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, “but if the candidate’s out of the mainstream, I can tell you I will fight and my caucus will fight tooth and nail against them. ” The chief reason that Democrats will not do what the Republicans did is that they can’t  —   Republicans remain in the Senate majority, which last year enabled them to refuse to even schedule a hearing and now gives them control over the confirmation process. But unlike with cabinet nominees, Democrats could still employ a filibuster against a Supreme Court pick, because the high court was excluded from a 2013 change engineered by Democrats to thwart filibusters against   nominees. If Democrats hold out, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, will no doubt come under pressure to wipe out the possibility of filibuster against Supreme Court nominees. Given the steps Republicans were willing to take to hold open the vacancy created by the death of Antonin Scalia, Democrats believe Senate Republicans might choose to eliminate that filibuster power, too. “All the signals are there is no limit to what they are capable of doing to give the big special interests behind them control of the court,” said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, a Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee. But Republicans are already differentiating their handling of Mr. Garland’s nomination from whatever is to come with the announcement by Mr. Trump. They argue that the situations are not comparable, given the timing of the presidential election. “There’s a big difference between not approving a Supreme Court nominee in the middle of a highly contested presidential election, and the beginning of a   term,” Mr. McConnell said on Tuesday, noting that Republicans did not filibuster Supreme Court nominees in the first term of either President Bill Clinton or Mr. Obama. Mr. McConnell took pains on Tuesday to note that both Republicans and Democrats were invited to the White House to discuss the coming nomination with Mr. Trump as part of the requirement for seeking the Senate’s advice and consent. Many Republicans and their conservative allies would prefer not to abolish the filibuster on Supreme Court nominees, knowing that it could come back to haunt them by allowing a future Democratic majority a free hand  —   essentially the same reason Democrats left high court nominees out of the 2013 change. It is also unclear whether Republicans would even have the votes to do so through a simple majority vote on an arcane procedural maneuver. But the question will hang over the entire confirmation fight and could force a showdown. If the Democrats filibuster, “ then I guess we’ll see what steps need to be taken at the time,” said Senator John Thune of South Dakota, a member of the Republican leadership. “But I think the one thing that we’re committed to is getting a Supreme Court justice confirmed. ” Democrats say that one result of the stalemate over Judge Garland is that it has shown that the Supreme Court can function, though imperfectly, without a full complement of nine members, relieving the party of some guilt for keeping the court   if it comes to that over a Trump nominee. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat who sits on the Judiciary Committee, said Democrats were also galvanized by the turnout at last weekend’s protests. He said it would serve as a unifying force for Senate Democrats. “That swell of people and strength and spirit at the marches we had Saturday showed us we have the American populace on our side,” Mr. Blumenthal said. “They understand the importance of the Supreme Court to those issues that brought them to the streets, principally women. ” Mr. Blumenthal said the selection of a nominee by President Trump would “put a face and a voice” on the Supreme Court battle. But for now, the face and voice most Democrats are putting on the coming clash are those belonging to Judge Garland."

 **Terry Dunleavy**



 **“Time for Action”** would be a good slogan for National for the coming election (in contrast to Labour’s talk-a-lot, do-nothing virtue signalling). We can’t start too soon, and this could underline Simon’s potential as a **walk-the-walk, decisive achiever-leader**. He should tackle Ardern head-on! The woke and the lefties will wail, but the news media will lap it all up.



The BFD’s excellent piece _[Will Ihumatao Be Ardern’s Waterloo?](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/02/will-ihumatao-be-arderns-waterloo/)_ is a good opening.



Simon needs to say: “C’mon Jacinda, put up or shut up! You’ve inserted yourself into the Ihumatao mess. What are you gonna actually DO? If you’re going to sneak money to buy off Fletchers and undermine our system of property law and our historic accepted process for Treaty settlements, stop fiddling, have the guts to say so, and take the consequences.”



I have to say that my personal attitude has been hardened by these comments from one of my Climate Science Coalition colleagues:



“Unfortunately for NZ, the final statement “- the hubris of a tiny cadre whose grand visions and lack of humility far exceed their ability to deliver” also applies perfectly to the ‘neo-liberal/right wing’ cadre of Treasury, Douglas, Caygill, Bassett, de Cleene, Palmer, Trotter, Kerr, Richardson, Birch and Bradford, who applied extreme theories that do not even work in theory.



As a result, the opposite of what was supposed to occur happened:



Debt did not go down, it ballooned;



Many of the most significant costs to homes and businesses soared;



The (true) skill base was devastated;



The bureaucracy at both central and local government level ballooned; and



Internal efficiency declined, and overall international competitiveness declined.



The reason that the public demanded that MMP (which is not popular with many members of this executive) be introduced was that for several elections, the public were promised one agenda at election time, and then were subjected to a completely different agenda (that of the tiny cadre described above, with a complicit moronic media) when elected. Pure fraud, similar to that which John Rofe correctly accuses Comrade Ardern of.”



I think Simon has to stop worrying about inevitable retorts from the woke and the left about why we didn’t address these issues during our nine years of National-led Government. I think Simon’s reply to that has to be along the lines of: “That’s history. That was then and this is now. National is under new leadership with a new and decisive reaction to the non-delivery by this current Coalition which is dragging New Zealand backwards. We won’t just talk about problems, we’ll fix them; we’ll put the country right” [my pun fully intended!].



Another issue Simon should attack – from another mate in North Shore about what’s happening in Auckland:



Have you heard about the Government’s ‘Urban Development Agency’? Not surprising if you haven’t. The Government seems to want to push it through Parliament under cover of Christmas and summer holidays. The Government introduced it into the House as late as 10th December. Submissions close on 14th February.



It seems the Minister in charge of this is **Mr Phil Twyford**. who previously made many fine speeches and claims about solving the housing crisis. This seems to be another such attempt. In my view, the proposed legislation might make even a totalitarian government blush.



Most of us probably believe that our home is our ‘castle.’ Not any more! Your house, your garden, your parks, can all be taken over compulsorily. by this new agency (disguised as Kainga Ora) for ‘large scale developments of intensive housing’ (undefined.)



This new legislation can override many other Acts of importance. It can also override the Unitary Plan, regional plans, reduces the time and grounds for resource consents, takes no account of climate change, or the environment generally.



Do read it and weep – or make a submission. See ‘NZ Parliament – Urban Development Bill.’ 



In the pre-election environment which has just begun, and will intensify when Parliament resumes next week, “Time for Action” begins with taking the gloves off and starting well-aimed and clear counter-punches at the virtue-signalling CoL. As for Winston: simply ignore him!



Kia kaha!

"The Carbon Sense Coalition’s response to the draft Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2008 makes the following conclusions (among others):

There are no climate benefits in mandating ever increasing shares of the electricity market for “renewable” energy. Therefore any scheme to generate electricity should stand on its own feet with no special tax breaks, subsidies or mandated market shares to support it.
All of this also leads to the conclusion that mandating market shares for “renewable energy” is not justified. This is just a sneaky way to impose taxes on conventional electricity generators in a way that most consumers will not notice. It is part of a deliberate Stealth Tax Scheme. It will stifle growth and deter economic recovery.
Mandated market shares are incompatible with the logic (if there is any) of Emission Trading Schemes or carbon taxes.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s the paradox of the German Energiewende (transition to green energy): power exchange market prices are lower than ever before, yet consumers are paying the highest prices ever – with no stop in the increases in sight. Moreover, the more green electricity that is fed into the grid, the more coal that gets burned.
Communist-quality state planning
If today’s German power grid sounds like a horror story of communist state-planned management, it is because it is in fact so. And unsurprisingly the whole industry is well on its way to a Soviet style meltdown.
For this we have former East German communist Angela Merkel to thank, in part, along with her spineless West German CDU cohorts, many of whom eagerly hopped on the gravy train and let the country be taken for a wild ride.
Today German Manager Magazin here brings us up to date on the country’s “greening” power grid — taking a look at the control center of grid operating company Tennet. Manager Magazin calls it the heart of the German Energiewende. Here a team of engineers decide how much gets fed into the various grids and which windparks are allowed to feed in and which aren’t.
Balancing act
Today the task has become a challenging balancing act. According to Manager Magazin, facility manager Volker Weinreich says “we have to intervene more often than ever to keep the power grid stable. We are getting closer and closer to the limit.”
The reason for the grid instability: the growing amount of erratic renewable energy being fed in, foremost wind and sun. Manager Magazin writes that there are always four workers monitoring the frequency at the Tennet control center, just outside Hannover, making sure that it stays near 50 Hz. Too much instability would mean a the “worst imaginable disaster: grid collapse and blackout“.
More price hikes in the pipeline
Manager Magazin reports Germany now has a huge oversupply of power flooding into the grid and thus causing prices on the electricity exchanges to plummet to levels never seen before. Yet, renewable electricity producers are guaranteed, in most cases over a period of 20 years, exorbitant high prices for their energy. This means power companies have to purchase at a high price, yet can get only very little for it on the exchange markets.

The German business magazine then writes that once again consumers will be getting the serious shaft, as the feed-in subsidy consumers are forced to pay will climb another 0.53 cents-euro in 2017, bringing the total feed in tariff for power consumers to 6.88 cents-euro for every kilowatt hour they consume.
Bavaria faces Industrial power blackout
Another huge problem is that by 2022 Germany will be shutting down the remaining nuclear power plants, a source that much of Germany’s industrial south relies on. In the meantime, the necessary transmission lines to transport wind power from the North Sea to the south are not getting built due to protests and permitting bottlenecks. This puts Bavaria’s heavy industry at risk. manager writes that the transmission lines are not expected to be completed by 2025!
In Part 3 of its report, manager Magazin reports that operating a power grid has become more complex and costly, due to the renewable power, and that the Energiewende has turned into “ecological foolishness“.  Weinreich describes how on stormy days wind parks are forced to shut down to keep the grid from frying. And the more wind turbines that come online, the more often wind parks need to be shut down. This makes them even more inefficient.
Not only do wind and solar feed in their power on a part-time basis, but now so do the conventional power plants as well — all according to the whims of the weather. An d too often they run at levels well below peak efficiency. The costs of all the inefficiencies get passed on to the consumers. Tens of thousands have been forced into “energy poverty”.
1400 interventions
Weinreich reports that the grid is so unstable that in 2015 it was necessary for Tennet to intervene some 1400 times. In the old conventional power days, it used to be only “a few times a year“.
In Part 4, Manager Magazin reports that all the intervention and shutdowns of runaway wind parks are “costing billions” for the consumers. Alone in 2017 Tennet says grid operating fees will rise 80%, translating to 30 euros more burden each year for each household. The money of course ends up flowing from poor consumers and into the pockets of wealthy solar and wind park operators and investors.
Little wonder that many experts call the German Energiewende the greatest bottom to top wealth distribution scheme ever created.

"Billed by the economy minister, Bruno Le Maire, as a “big green recovery plan”, one-third of France’s €100bn (£90bn) post-Covid economic stimulus package will be spent, in the government’s words, on “ecological transition” and “greening the economy”. Environmental groups said the plan, presented on Thursday by the prime minister, Jean Castex, and other cabinet members, marked a welcome first step – but criticised a missed opportunity to break decisively with a growth-driven, high-carbon economy.  “After multiple announcements of a plan meant to ‘reconcile economy and ecology’, the government has presented a recovery plan from a bygone era,” said Jean-François Julliard, the head of Greenpeace France. “It’s a lot less green than it looks.” The overall package, aimed at pulling France out of a deep Covid-induced slump, equates to 4% of GDP – more than any other big EU country – and has three key objectives: increasing competitiveness, boosting jobs, and greening the economy. The main environmental measures focus on transport, energy production and energy-efficient renovation programmes for public buildings, offices and homes. A further €1.5bn is to be spent on greening the food sector, for example by developing shorter supply chains, and the fishing industry. About €11bn will be invested in transport. Nearly €5bn of that will be spent on France’s rail network, with the aim of shifting a significantly greater proportion of freight traffic from road to rail and boosting local lines and night services. More than €1bn will be devoted to encouraging bicycle use by building more cycle lanes and subsidising bike maintenance, with a further €2bn being spent on financial incentives for drivers to switch to cleaner cars. More than €7bn has been set aside for energy efficiency for buildings such as schools, universities, town halls and police stations, but also for business premises and private homes, with subsidies available to all from next year for projects including improving home insulation or changing to a more energy-efficient boiler. About €9bn is set to be invested in helping French industry transition to greener energy, with the aim of reaching carbon neutrality by 2050. More than €3bn will be spent on efforts to “decarbonise” industry, including developing green hydrogen technologies and a national hydrogen economy. Campaigners remain largely unconvinced, arguing that there was little point spending millions on greening the economy if millions were also being spent on polluting industries and outdated technologies. Some measures in the broader recovery programme were counterproductive, they said. “Blank cheques have been written to the aviation and automobile sectors,” Julliard said, “and the government is still kowtowing to the private sector. There are €20bn of tax cuts for industry in the recovery plan that companies will benefit from regardless of their environmental impact, with no green conditions attached.” The sums allocated to the rail network and the agriculture sector were “certainly important”, he said. “But this plan will not change things structurally: there is nothing on reducing road or air traffic, on the cuts to beef, egg and milk production that will be necessary to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.” Arnaud Schwartz, the president of France Nature Environment, also said the recovery plan should be viewed as a whole. “What are €30bn when France … is investing €300bn in nuclear energy?” he said. “We want a full environmental impact report on the whole package, before and after implementation. It isn’t happening.” Louise Kessler, of the Institute for Climate Economics, said the environmental measures were a good start but would need to be extended over the long term. “Extra money should also be in addition – it must finance investment, not just make good the deficits left by the crisis,” she told Le Monde. Another NGO, Réseau Action Climat, said €30bn was not enough, arguing that more than €43bn would be needed over the next two years alone to make meaningful progress. An ecologist MP, Matthieu Orphelin, said the plan was “a welcome catch-up” but “nowhere near enough for the step change in climate policy we need”."
"

From the “I mentioned climate change and greenhouse gases so send more money” files; this research would appear to be clutching at straws in a search for relevance. Either that or they are simply taking the piss.



Wildlife ecologist Associate Professor Topa Petit, in her Kangaroo Island-based research found that sugar ants prefer urine over sugar – the food source after which they’re named – nocturnally foraging on it to extract nitrogen molecules, some of which could end up in the **greenhouse gas** , nitrous oxide.



There – got the magic words in!



The Australian-first study compared the behaviours of sugar ants (Camponotus terebrans) as they were exposed to different concentrations of urine (human and kangaroo ~ 2.5 per cent urea), sugar water (20 per cent and 40 per cent), and urea in water (at 2.5 per cent; 3.5 per cent; 7 per cent and 10 per cent), finding that sugar ants were most attracted to higher concentrations of urea, mining them for long periods within a dry sand substrate.



While other ants are known to be attracted to urine, this is the first time that ants have been observed mining dry urine from sand, and for a long period of time.



Assoc Prof Petit says the curious discovery could play a role in nitrogen cycling.



“When I first noticed the ants swarming to scavenge urine, it was purely by accident. But under research conditions we found that the ants determinedly mined urea patches night after night with greater numbers of ants drawn to higher urea concentrations,” Assoc Prof Petit says.



Did she get caught short, behind the bushes, one day?



“Camponotus terebrans are undoubtedly looking for urea in urine because, similar to certain other ant species, a bacterium in their digestive tract allows them to process urea to get nitrogen for protein.



“This remarkable ability to extract urea from dry sand not only shows how sugar ants can survive in arid conditions, but also, how they might reduce the release of ammonia from urine, which leads to the production of nitrous oxide, a highly active greenhouse gas.”



Nitrous oxide (NO2) [sic – it is N2O, or ‘laughing gas’] is a greenhouse gas 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide. And while less abundant than carbon dioxide emissions, its presence in the atmosphere has increased substantially over the past decade, accelerated mostly by the widespread use of fertilisers.



Bad naughty farmers! And besides, nitrous oxide is a **less potent greenhouse** gas than carbon dioxide because of its low atmospheric concentration, less than 1/1000 of that of CO2.



Assoc Prof Petit says that while there is still a lot to learn about the foraging behaviours of sugar ants, the study shows a symbiotic relationship between ants and vertebrates such as **kangaroos** in dry environments, and evidence of the nitrogen cycle at work. […]



“Researchers working on ants as bio-indicators on grazed and ungrazed lands should take ants’ ability to process urea into account, because large amounts of urine will probably affect the assortment of ant species in the area. It would also be interesting to investigate how much ants may modify the urine ammonia volatilises from paddocks.



“This is not the last we will hear about these sugar ants – they could open up a whole new field of ~~grants~~ research.”



Send money now.



The comments of Mike Jonas are worth a repeat:



Assoc Prof Petit says that there is still a lot to learn about the foraging behaviours of sugar ants. She would be well advised to work on just that and not make asinine comments that reveal her abject lack of knowledge about climate. A tonne of ants, say, generating between them a tonne of GHGs every day would generate 365.25 tonnes of GHG per year (we’re doing climate science, so we have to have at least two decimal places). Earth’s GHG content is multiple petatonnes – a measure so large no-one ever uses it. Our tonne of ants would take around 1,000,000,000,001.57 years to generate a noticeable proportion of that. At our sun’s current rate of progress, it will have exploded and regenerated after the following big bang several dozen times by then.



Just study ants, professor.

Ten years ago, NASA scientist James E. Hansen lit the Bonfire of the Greenhouse Vanities. Testifying to a joint House and Senate committee, he argued that there was “a strong cause and effect relationship between the current climate” — then a blistering drought — “and human alteration of the atmosphere.” His accompanying paper, published in Geophysical Research Letters, predicted a 0.34 degree Celsius rise in average global temperature in the succeeding decade. 



By all measures of global temperature — and we have three — Hansen’s forecast was a bust. Temperatures on the ground rose a mere 0.11º C during the decade, while temperatures of the lower atmosphere measured by satellites and weather balloons actually declined — by 0.24º C and 0.36º C, respectively. 



In a recent paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Hansen explains why he was wrong: the planet is getting greener and consuming carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse warming gas, at a rate far exceeding what he and the other climate modelers predicted a mere 10 years ago. In fact, the observed changes in carbon dioxide levels are below the lowest scenarios thought to be reasonable by none other than the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change — otherwise known as the “consensus of 2,500 scientists” that Vice President Gore is fond of marshaling in support of his position on the issue.



We could have saved a lot of time and grief if we had just listened to the “cynics” (Washingtonese for those who don’t think Washington is required for global salvation) when Hansen made his 1988 splash. They pointed out that the observed planetary warming, even back then, was far too small to support Hansen’s forecast. And, to make things worse, at least half of that warming had occurred prior to 1930, before greenhouse changes could have caused it. The lion’s share of the warming was also confined to the coldest air masses of Siberia and northwestern North America in the dead of winter, where warming from an average temperature of -40 degrees Celsius to, say, -38 degrees, is hardly a disaster.



The failing paradigm of dramatic warming was to be shored up with a great deal of intellectual effort — as is common in science. Thomas Kuhn frequently pointed out in his many studies of the evolution of scientific thought that explanations become increasingly ornate and bizarre as the disconnection between models and reality broadens.



The failing paradigm of dramatic warming was to be shored up with a great deal of intellectual effort — as is common in science. 



One such artifice, championed by Hansen in a 1990 paper, was that the warming was being moderated by sulfate aerosols, another result of fossil fuel combustion that whitens the sky and reflects away the sun’s rays, thereby compensating for greenhouse warming. When he prepared testimony on this matter in 1992, the Bush administration tried to soften its stridency, as Hansen remained committed to dramatic warming in the near future. That kindled then‐​senator Al Gore, who had just published a bestseller singing Hansen’s praises. He stood on the Capitol steps with his arm around the NASA scientist, vowing to “start World War III” if anyone attempted to modify Hansen’s testimony.



In 1996 my colleague Chip Knappenberger and I noted in Nature that the sulfate hypothesis doesn’t hold up because the sulfate‐​free regions of the planet have actually cooled in the last decade, instead of warming. About the same time, Hansen concurred, publishing a paper demonstrating that sulfates have exerted no net cooling effect in the last two decades after all. That considerable change of direction pushed him into a dilemma — if sulfates weren’t responsible for the lack of warming, what was?



Undaunted, the vice president was in Kyoto a year later, pushing U.S. negotiators into approving language in a UN climate treaty that would require an astonishing 43 percent reduction in fossil fuel‐​related emissions of greenhouse gases by the year 2010, compared to the emissions we would produce if we remained on the trajectory we have been on for nearly two decades. In preparation for Kyoto, U.S. Under Secretary of State Timothy Wirth (now working for Ted Turner’s anti‐​global warming campaign) repeatedly declared that “the science is settled.”



Here’s how Hansen has settled the science. According to his PNAS paper, “Apparently the rate of uptake by carbon dioxide sinks, either the ocean, or more likely, forests and soils, has increased.” In other words, the planet is not warming because it is getting greener.



In spite of that, Hansen remains compelled to sound the alarm. While admitting that observed climate changes have been too small for anyone to notice, he proposes a “common‐​sense” government‐​sponsored index of climate change that he feels will whip up enough concern to create a political consensus to act.



In PNAS, Hansen trots out his index. Lo and behold, the only place it shows persistent greenhouse changes is in the dead of winter in Siberia and northwestern Canada, exactly where the “cynics” told him to look in 1988!



When someone like NASA’s Jim Hansen says that all of the anomalous warming is in Siberia and Nunavit, and that the planet is getting much greener and not much hotter as a result of increased carbon dioxide, it is over. The science is settled. The case is closed and the Kyoto treaty is dead, shot through the heart by the climatologist for whom Al Gore vowed to go to war.

"FULING, China  —     mountains rise high in this sleepy Yangtze River district, best known for its crunchy pickled mustard tubers. But one of these mountains is not like the others. On the peak of Jinzi Mountain in Fuling, a single chimney stands sentinel over the adjacent Wu River. The chimney has been idle since it was built decades ago. Only in recent years has the public learned why. Fifteen years ago, the local government announced that inside the   mountain lay the remnants of what was once one of China’s most ambitious military infrastructure projects: the   816 nuclear plant. Initiated in the 1960s during the height of tensions between China and the Soviet Union, the 816 project was China’s first attempt to build a nuclear reactor that could produce   plutonium without Soviet involvement. But there was one catch. To reduce the possibility of an attack, Chinese officials and engineers made the unusual decision to place the reactor underground, complicating an already challenging engineering process. Over the next 18 years, more than 60, 000 workers participated in the risky project, and some died in the process. The result was what is said to be the world’s largest artificial cave, able to withstand the force of thousands of tons of explosives as well as a magnitude 8 earthquake. But when China began a sweeping civilian defense conversion of many of its military projects in the early 1980s, work on the nearly finished plant was abruptly called to a halt. For 26 years, it functioned partly as a chemical fertilizer factory before being revived for  tourism in 2010  —   an improbable twist of fate for this quirk of Cold War history. Still, for many former workers, the 816 project remains a source of bitter regret. Even as China charges ahead with an ambitious  —   if controversial  —   plan to build nuclear plants around the country and expand the use of nuclear energy,   military nuclear projects like 816 have all but been forgotten. “Back then, the project took so much from these young men, including our livelihoods,” said Chen Huaiwen, 69, a former soldier who worked on the excavation of the mountain from 1969 to 1974. “We need to make this clear to the public. Otherwise it will have been a huge waste of our efforts and manpower. ” To address these concerns, the 816 site recently underwent a year of renovations. Since it reopened in September, visitors  —   including, for the first time, foreigners  —   can now see about   of the cave, which contains nearly 13 miles of tunnel roads. On a recent afternoon, a group of tourists, led by an energetic tour guide who came dressed in military fatigues and combat boots, clambered onto a golf cart at the roadside entrance of one of the tunnels. From there, the cart burrowed straight into the belly of Jinzi Mountain, cool air whooshing by. At the tour’s first stop, a cavernous hall that once held the plant’s   facilities, ominous doomsday music blared while neon lights bathed the   room in blue, red and then pink. It was a scene that was perhaps more befitting of an underground rave than a Communist history education tour, apart from a display that showed, among other things, an image of a mushroom cloud from China’s first nuclear test at Lop Nur in 1964. Speaking into a microphone, Qi Hong, the tour guide, explained: “This cave represents not only the efforts of the 816 workers but also an important part of history in China’s national defense and nuclear development. ” Standing around Ms. Qi were 30 or so mostly older Chinese. Throughout the   tour, Ms. Qi led the group through a maze of empty reactor halls, exhibition rooms and dim staircases, stopping frequently to lecture so the elderly visitors could catch their breath. Although most in the group had not heard of the project until recently, they were old enough to recall the historical circumstances that led the government to single out this picturesque place in southwestern China  —   also the backdrop of the writer Peter Hessler’s   memoir “River Town”  —   as the site of a massive nuclear complex. It began, Ms. Qi explained, with the Third Front, the colossal defense program started by China in 1964 to create an industrial base in the country’s interior. China already had a nuclear reactor  —   the   404 project in the northwestern province of Gansu. But as concerns grew about that reactor’s vulnerability to attack, in 1966 Premier Zhou Enlai personally approved the plan to build a replica of the 404 project underground in Fuling. Soon after, scientists, engineers, soldiers and other supporting staff came from all around the country to this remote area  —   then reachable only by boat  —   to work on the 816 project. They represented some of the nation’s top talent, having studied at China’s leading universities, as well as in the Soviet Union and Japan. “The plant reflects the greatness of the Chinese people,” said Xia Renhui, 66, a retiree from the northeastern city of Shenyang who was touring the plant. “And now, China is even stronger. Obama’s Army is not good enough to fight us!” From the beginning, it was a   project. Locals and even many of the soldiers working at the site were unaware of the project’s true purpose. The complex included schools, a market and a hospital so the workers could live in total isolation. The nearby town of Baitao disappeared from the map. “All we knew was the code name 816,” said Li Tingyong, a local resident and later head of the Fuling tourism bureau, in a 2010 television program about the 816 plant. “But we had no idea what it was a code name for. It was very mysterious. ” Life was especially hard for the more than 20, 000 young soldiers. Many had enlisted thinking they were heading to Beijing, only to find that they had been assigned to work at the 816 project site. For a small monthly salary of around 6 renminbi, or $2. 44 at the time, the soldiers  —   whose average age was 21  —   were tasked with excavating the hard rock with only small drills, dynamite and shovels. It was dangerous work, and the pressure to finish the project was immense. Soldiers worked around the clock, urged on by the slogan “Fight the clock against imperialism, revisionism and counterrevolutionaries!” Many were injured or died. Today official figures put the number of fatalities at around 100. “But I don’t believe it,” said Ms. Qi, in a rare departure from her script, suggesting the real number was higher. “The environment was too harsh. ” By the time the project was called off in 1984, 85 percent of the construction had been finished. Over all, total investment in the 816 project is estimated at more than 746 million renminbi, or about $359 million at the time. But sunk costs aside, some experts say the decision to abandon the 816 project was ultimately a sound one. “The only good thing that happened with the project was that they didn’t finish it,” said Hui Zhang, a senior research associate at Harvard University’s Project on Managing the Atom. “In terms of the overall development of China’s nuclear program, the 816 project really did not contribute anything. ” Still, for many of the people like Mr. Chen, who gave years of their lives to the 816 project, a sense of loss and resentment lingers. “Ultimately we worked on the project because we thought we were working for the nation,” Mr. Chen said in a telephone interview as he traveled home to Shanxi Province after visiting the reopened plant. “If we knew that in the end it would be made into a tourist site, we never would have participated. ”"
"As new generations reach for words to describe the world around them they often delve into the vocabulary of nature. Words such as stream, tweet and cloud have been adopted and given new meaning, in these cases to describe elements of the technological world in which we now live. But is this at the expense of the natural world? A 2019 survey of 1000 children would suggest so. It showed that 83% of those questioned could not identify a bumblebee and nearly half could not identify brambles, blackberries and bluebells. Surveys like this support the idea that British people are losing touch with nature.  There has been research into how languages and words evolve and become extinct and even how others survive. But there is a lack of academic research which looks specifically at the language of nature. But a collaborative project from King’s College London, the Leverhulme Trust and Lancaster University is underscoring the very real relationship between people’s attitudes to nature and the language we use. Initial findings from that project show that red squirrels were represented in the 19th century as being pests in need of culling.  They were not described as “cute” or shown in visually appealing ways. The arrival of the grey squirrel in 1876 changed public attitudes as red squirrel numbers declined and the language of the media clearly changed over time towards the modern, positive image.

      When languages die, we lose a part of who we are


 As children – and even as adults – we can only identify and talk about what we have learned or been taught. For example, Guardian columnist and naturalist George Monbiot has argued that each generation is normalising the erosion of the environment. Children, he says, are growing up with a new and depleted baseline of what they see as the “normal” range of wildlife around them. Similarly, I believe, that each generation grows up with a new and depleted baseline of how we talk about nature and wildlife. So a new GCSE in natural history can only be a good thing if it helps teenagers reconnect with wildlife by learning the names and characteristics of plants and animals. The new qualification is the brainchild of writer Mary Colwell and has been supported by Green party MP Caroline Lucas and by senior figures at the University of Cambridge. I have researched language and language use for 21 years but I became more keenly aware of the relationship between noticing the natural world and being able to name bits of it when I read Robert MacFarlane’s book Landmarks. MacFarlane points out forgotten words such as “ammil” (a Devon word for a fine film of ice that covers leaves and twigs) and a “smeuse” (a gap in a hedge made by the passage of a small animal). I have noticed a lot more ammil and smeuses since I read the book, which describes hundreds of words from across the British isles for snow, ice, animal calls and noises.  Despite this abundance, the public’s vocabulary is being whittled down when it comes to nature, as a National Trust project found. The research discovered that words from the 1990s which were entirely used to refer to the natural world, have now taken on meaning from the world of computers and the internet. Cloud, stream and tweet are such examples. In a comparable dataset from the 2010s the National Trust study shows that cloud has fallen to 77%, stream is down to 36% and tweet is down to 1% of its old usage in everyday conversation. The trust’s regional director for the midlands, Andy Beer, said: “As a nation we are losing our connection with nature… If today’s children aren’t connected to nature, then who is going to stand up for our countryside and wildlife in the future?” So does this apparent change in language use reflect changing attitudes to the natural world? A study by Natural England suggests it does, with evidence that children in London and the West Midlands are the least likely to spend time outdoors in woodlands or other similar wild places.  Meanwhile, another study from 2018 found that different ethnic groups can have different ideas when it comes to what comprises nature. In the study, all ethnic groups listed trees, forests and plants as terms they associate with nature.  But there was more variance when it came to animals. Around 40% of “other” ethnicities said they thought of animals when asked about “nature”, along with 28% of white people. This dropped to just 14% when the question was asked of black people. This is an important reminder that this must not be a discussion restricted to white, middle-class academics. There needs to be participation from across society to fully understand what could be causing a decline of nature words.

 Of course, language is always changing and evolving. Children will not stop playing computer games and they will not stop having an interest in new technology – and nor should they. But the adults in this conversation must explore ways to combine modern technology with a love of nature.  People already take their phones and tablets on citizen science trips to study butterflies and bugs. So let’s welcome the new technology, create apps and develop innovative ways for children to learn words from both worlds. Wouldn’t it be great to see young people tweeting about ammil covered leaves and smeuses as they take their first steps into the great outdoors?"

In the western nations there is a strong popular belief that mankind is causing global warming, and that natural climate change has ceased. We are told that man-made climate change will determine our future, with warmer climates, increased droughts, and rising sea levels. The media have become advocates in support of this view, and contrary debate is suppressed. Western governments now plan to “stop” climate change, an arrogant idea that has already caused enormous costs. In my view it is all a scientific scandal, a political farce, and a financial calamity. Meanwhile, certain other nations are profiting by the popular delusion in the west, notably Russia, and China.

The Russian Academy of Sciences rejects the UN/IPCC view that the combustion of carbon fuels causes global climate change. The Russian government is alert to the fact that carbon dioxide is not a pollutant, and regard emissions trading as financial game playing. Air pollution in cities, and global climate change, are scientifically separate matters.
The Kyoto Protocol is an international agreement to reduce carbon emissions. Russia was not an original signatory, for scientific reasons. Even though they regarded the IPCC conclusions as wrong, Russia finally signed the Protocol, for commercial purposes. It was evident to the Russians that western governments were being stampeded by false prophets, that the many of the actions proposed in western nations were scientific nonsense, and enormously harmful to their economies.
The financial opportunities for Russia were truly enormous. Because of the decline in Russian industry with the end of the cold war, carbon emissions had declined. This was a credit under the Kyoto Protocol.
The total value of Russian carbon credits was estimated at $40 to $60 billion. But if future negotiations to extend the Kyoto Protocols were to collapse, the carbon credits would be worth nothing. The Russian energy giant Gazprom moved quickly to bundle carbon credits with contracts for sale of natural gas and oil to Europe. Russia became the world’s largest exporter of oil and natural gas.
Russia is now very active in energy supply to Europe, helped by carbon trading. It is all quite business like and pragmatic. Europe now buys over 40% of its oil and gas from Russia, Germany 80%. The demand is rising rapidly, and almost all the increase is from Russia. Because of environmental concerns, Europe is not building any new coal or nuclear electricity generation, and using gas for electricity generation. Plans for new electricity generation in Britain also depend on Russian gas.
The future of the EU is now heavily dependent on Russia. Europe simply cannot cut itself off from Russian oil and gas. Europe is concerned about this, but helpless. It has all been a Russian geopolitical victory, made possible by the popular delusion in the west about climate change. The Russian incursion into Georgia, and their confident rejection of EU and US criticism, reveals the new geopolitical reality. Meanwhile, it seems that the Russian government has not moved to pass legislation to implement the Kyoto Protocol domestically.

"George Monbiot (Population panic lets rich people off the hook for the climate crisis they are fuelling, 26 August) seriously misrepresents Population Matters and indeed any individual or organisation who raises the issue of population as a key factor in fuelling the ecological crisis. Monbiot argues that the solution to our ecological crisis is only about curbing consumption in rich nations. He condemns any individual or organisation who believes this won’t be enough as having other underlying, deplorable agendas.  But he is profoundly wrong. Indeed, population was highlighted as a key factor to address by the Global Footprint Network on Earth Overshoot Day, which fell on 22 August. GFN identified five key pillars for bringing humanity into balance on an equitable basis with the Earth’s available, sustainable resources. Population is one of those. If every other family had one fewer child than currently expected and parenthood was postponed by two years, Overshoot Day would move back 49 days by 2050. The moral duty and necessity of addressing consumption rates in rich countries is clear and a given. We also emphasise the disproportionate impact of people in high-consuming countries like the UK making the positive, individual choice to have smaller families, so bringing wider societal and environmental benefits. An inconvenient fact, which Monbiot ignores, is that current growth in consumption is greatest in the developing world, in the same countries where, until relatively recently, population growth rates have been among the highest. If highlighting population growth is blaming the poor, “finger-pointing” and “racist”, then highlighting consumption growth must also be? We want to see a greater proportion of people everywhere enjoying better, sustainable lives. Not, as Monbiot’s logic would result in, the poor staying poor. You can find Population Matters’ full response on our website.Robin MaynardDirector, Population Matters • George Monbiot is right about many things: that the rich have larger ecological footprints than the poor; that there are no simple fixes to population growth; that some measures that could be technically feasible are inappropriate because of human rights issues; and that the population argument can be used as a pretext for opposing immigration. But it is a fact that environmental problems are caused by humans, and that the number of humans is a multiplicative factor exacerbating these problems. It is therefore imperative that leaders first stabilise population (by humane means) and then reduce it to a sustainable level, in rich as well as poor countries.Anders SirénAdjunct professor of geography, Kirjala, Finland • George Monbiot is not a typical population denier, as he acknowledges that population growth does have an adverse impact in some areas, particularly on biodiversity. But his attempt to shut down any discussion on population is cruel, even if well-meant. We all want to avoid giving fuel to racists; we all want to avoid people thinking that there is a single solution to the climate crisis. But we are in a climate emergency, and blocking off helpful solutions because of the fear that they will give the wrong message is not appropriate. The answer is to fight for the right message to be heard. Monbiot gives this message when he refers to “female emancipation and education” being the “strongest determinate of falling birth rates”, and the importance of eliminating extreme poverty to achieve this.Martin EarlLondon"

Morris not only has a good knowledge of history, but of policy practicality as well. In the video, he takes a pragmatic view at what is feasible when it come to energy in the United States.
Not worth throwing sovereignty overboard
First Morris comes out saying he thinks the jury is sill out on climate science, acknowledging that humans and natural factors play roles in driving climate change – view that is held by many of the so-called skeptics. He emphasizes that climate change is a serious problem, but not one that warrants throwing freedom and sovereignty overboard.
In the transportation sector, Morris believes that the internal combustion engine will eventually yield to other technologies, such as hydrogen fuelled engines.
Great progress through fracking

For manufacturing, Morris offers interesting statistics showing the great strides the US has made in reducing coal consumption for firing power plants, from over 55% some years ago to less than 40% today. He expects natural gas to surpass coal in the years ahead.
This progress is in large part due to the much greater supply and use of natural gas extracted from fracking. The technology has made a major contribution in cleaning up US energy production, no doubt. America has indeed made great strides in transforming its energy sector over the past two decades.
Renewable energy has only limited practicality
On renewable energy, Morris thinks that its use in the United States will be limited due to its impractical production and transmission. He scoffs at the idea of taking over the Danish model and imposing it on the United States.
He summarizes:
Renewable resources will be appropriate only for certain areas, very few areas, and with heavy subsidies so that it can compete with market prices — the subsidies too expensive, the areas too limited. And so the environmentalists are saying, ‘Well, if you can’t have perfection, then let’s not improve the current system, let’s not replace coal with natural gas. Let’s replace it with renewable resources that are not practical, are not available, not economical.’ So keep our eye on the ball: reducing carbon emissions where possible. But don’t destroy the whole American economy and make us non-competitive with global economies simply because of it. It is a major problem, but it is not only or even the only major problem we face.”
Dick Morris has put up a series of videos on energy policy, see here.
Merry Christmas and Happy Hanukkah!

"Young activists from Portugal have filed the first climate change case at the European court of human rights in Strasbourg, demanding 33 countries make more ambitious emissions cuts to safeguard their future physical and mental wellbeing. The crowdfunded legal action breaks new ground by suing multiple states both for the emissions within their borders and also for the climate impact that their consumers and companies have elsewhere in the world through trade, fossil-fuel extraction and outsourcing.  The plaintiffs – four children and two young adults – want the standard-setting court to issue binding orders on the 33 states, which include the EU as well as the UK, Norway, Russia, Turkey, Switzerland and Ukraine, to prevent discrimination against the young and protect their rights to exercise outdoors and live without anxiety. The case is being filed after Portugal recorded its hottest July in 90 years. It was initiated three years ago following devastating forest fires in Portugal that killed over 120 people in 2017. Four of the plaintiffs are from Leiria, one of the worst-hit areas. The two other applicants live in Lisbon, which sweltered through record-breaking 44C heat in 2018. Expert testimony will warn that these trends will worsen in the future. On the current path of about 3C of warming above pre-industrial levels, scientists have predicted a thirty-fold increase in deaths from heatwaves in western Europe by the period 2071-2100. At 4C, which is also possible, they say heatwaves above 40C would endure for more than 30 days a year, quadrupling the risk of forest fires. Catarina Mota, 20, said governments must act on scientific warnings because the climate crisis was already affecting young people psychologically and physically. “I am afraid for the future,” she said. “Lately, it is already impossible to exercise outdoors. If that was only for a few days it would be fine but the heatwaves are extreme and recurring. I live with the feeling my home is becoming more hostile each year. It scares me a lot.” Sofia Oliveira, aged 15, said her generation was acutely conscious of the dangers that lie ahead: “We have seen unbearable heatwaves that cause water shortages and damage food production, and violent wildfires that give us anxiety and make us afraid to travel through our country’s forests … If we already see these extremes in 2020 what will the future be like?” She said the EU must commit to a minimum 65% emissions reduction target by 2030 and ensure a green recovery from the Covid crisis by investing in renewables and clean technology rather than fossil fuels. The young applicants are being represented by British barristers, including Marc Willers QC, who are experts in environmental and climate change law, and supported by the London- and Dublin-based NGO Global Legal Action Network (Glan), which raised £27,000 through crowdfunding. More than 1,300 climate-related lawsuits have been filed worldwide since 1990. The most successful so far was in the Netherlands, where the Urgenda Foundation forced the government into scaling back coal-fired power plants and taking other compliance measures worth about €3bn (£2.7bn). Gerry Liston, legal officer with Glan, said the latest case could go further because Strasbourg sets standards that other courts follow. “This case is unique in scale. This is the most countries ever taken to a regional court in a climate change case. If we win, it will have a very significant effect throughout Europe.” He noted that this was the first time the court had dealt with an issue that threatens the very system of rules it was established to uphold, citing a warning last year by the UN special rapporteur Philip Alston that human rights may not survive the upheaval caused by climate change. The NGO behind the case says the legal campaign aims to amplify the pressure applied by school climate strikers. “This is a culmination of all the campaigning that the youth movement are engaged in. Now they are asking the courts to step up. This is a last-ditch effort to put the ship back on a course that doesn’t involve catastrophic climate change,” said Gearóid Ó Cuinn, the director of Glan. “It is the youth who stand to be discriminated against. They bear the burden in terms of risk.” The court will have to consider whether the case is admissible and then, if so, rule on the merits of the case. This could take months or years. A new phase of crowdfunding has been launched. Ó Cuinn said there was no time to wait: “The situation is dire. The climate threat dwarfs Covid. Given the urgency of dealing with emissions, we think our case should be a priority.”"
"Climate alarmist, Al Gore, who has been predicting for the last two decades that we are all going to experience runaway global warming, was dealt a blow last month when his home town Nashville Tennessee experienced July’s coldest day on record since 1877. http://www.wsmv.com/weather/20116659/detail.html
His string of failed predictions were supported by the British Met office’s sixty six million dollar (AU) computer modeling. They both incorrectly predicted 2009 would be one of the five warmest years ever. The world has just experienced two of the coldest and snowiest winters in decades. 
Even Dr Michael Mann of “hockey stick” fame has done a back-flip stating that global temperatures will continue to decline for another decade – then we will experience the warmest years ever. Even though Al Gore, the Met Office, Dr Mann and his “hockey stick” graph have been proved wildly wrong, Kevin Rudd’s propaganda machine will now move into overdrive selling the Emission Trading Scheme. The ETS is the most expensive piece of fiction in the history of Australian politics and will achieve absolutely nothing.

                                                           Above image  from Hanna et al., 2011  (Greenland Ice Sheet)
In 1942, eight U.S. WWII aircraft (2 bombers, 6 fighter planes) emergency-landed on the Southwestern coast of Greenland after encountering severe weather.   The crews were rescued and the planes ultimately had to be abandoned at the landing site.  So there the planes sat on the Greenland ice sheet, undetected, for more than 4 decades.  The active search for the WWII planes had been ongoing since 1981, but it wasn’t until 1988 that a group of artifact enthusiasts (Greenland Expedition Society) were able to finally locate the planes.  The primary reason why it was so excruciatingly difficult to find the planes is that the explorers  had originally assumed the planes were buried under ice that was relatively close to the ice sheet’s surface.  They weren’t.  When the planes were finally found in 1988, 46 years after crash-landing on the Greenland ice sheet, they were buried under 260 feet (79 meters) of ice. In other words, between 1942 and 1988, the Greenland ice sheet gained mass at a rate of 57 feet (17 meters) per decade at that location.  In 1992, the planes were impressively pulled out of the ice part-by -part.  In that 4-year span between 1988 (discovery) and 1992 (recovery), the Greenland ice sheet had advanced with another 8 feet of ice, as the planes were 268 feet beneath the ice sheet surface when they were rescued.
It should come as no surprise that the Greenland ice sheet gained so many billion tons of ice during the 50 years from 1942 to 1992.  After all, the scientific literature has been replete with records of rapidly declining Greenland temperature trends between the 1940s and the 1990s, which followed a period of especially rapid warming during the 1920s and 1930s (that was greater in rapidity and magnitude when compared to the Greenland ice sheet warming trend in the last decade or two).
These trends are the opposite of what should be expected from anthropogenic forcing in climate models.  After all, the rapid 1920s to 1930s Greenland warming occurred while anthropogenic CO2 emissions remained flat at about 1 GtC/year (gigatons of carbon), whereas the 1940 to 1995 Greenland cooling period was accompanied by human CO2 emissions rates that rose by more than a factor of 6, or from 1 GtC/year to well over 6 GtC/year (see here).  Succinctly, Greenland warmed rapidly while CO2 emissions were flat, and Greenland cooled rapidly while CO2 emissions were significantly rising.   As Kahl et al. (1993) write in their paper entitled “Absence of evidence for greenhouse warming over the Arctic Ocean in the past 40 years” [1950-1990], climate models “do not adequately incorporate the physical processes that affect the polar regions.”
There were higher Greenland Ice Sheet melting rates in the 1920s and 1930s than in recent decades.
It should be noted that the Greenland ice sheet surface mass balance trends are calculated using a baseline period of 1961-1990.  The problem with this is, of course, that the 1961-1990 period was unusually cool in Greenland — about 1 to 2°C cooler than the 1920s to 1930s period.  Therefore, any estimate of surface mass balance for the post-1990 period will necessarily be biased towards greater melt rates.  Had the 1920s to 1930s period been used as a baseline, the recent decades of warming would likely only mean that the Greenland ice sheet has returned to balance, and is not rapidly losing mass as is often claimed.
Fettweis et al., 2008
“These estimates show that the high surface mass loss rates of recent years are not unprecedented in the GrIS [Greenland Ice Sheet] history of the last hundred years. The minimum SMB rate seems to have occurred earlier in the 1930s and corresponds to a zero SMB rate….The results show that the GrIS surface mass loss in the 1930s is likely to have been more significant than currently due to a combination of very warm and dry years.”

Below, there are graphs from several papers indicating that Greenland cooled between the 1940s and 1990s.
Box, 2002
“Temporal and spatial variability are analysed in Greenland instrumental temperature records from 24 coastal and three ice sheet locations. … The standard period 1961–90 was marked by 1–2°C statistically significant cooling.”

Dahl-Jensen et al., 1998

Drinkwater, 2006 (Greenland)

Scientists have found that the overall cooling trend for Greenland since 1940 may have extended to the early 2000s.
Chylek et al., 2004
“A significant and rapid temperature increase was observed at all Greenland stations between 1920 and 1930. The average annual temperature rose between 2 and 4°C in less than ten years.”
“A substantial decrease in the surface air temperature occurred over the Greenland ice sheet summit in summer season during the period of available measurements from 1987 to 2001. The average temperature of the warmest month and the summer average (June, July and August) temperature show a decreasing trend of 3.0 and 2.2°C/decade between 1987 and 2001 (Figure 8). This summer cooling of the ice sheet at the Summit is accompanied by winter warming at the rate of about 2°C per decade. The result is a substantial decrease in the annual temperature range (Figure 8) from 34°C in 1987 to less than 28°C in 2001. The cause of these rapid changes and decrease in temperature range is undetermined, however, a change in cloud cover is a possibility.”

Hanna and Cappelen, 2003
“Analysis of new data for eight stations in coastal southern Greenland, 1958–2001, shows a significant cooling (trend-line change −1.29°C for the 44 years), as do sea-surface temperatures in the adjacent part of the Labrador Sea”

As recently as 1992-2002, the whole Greenland ice sheet continued to gain mass (at a rate of +11 Gt/year), which meant a net negative contribution to sea level rise from the Greenland ice sheet during that period.
Zwally et al., 2005
“Changes in ice mass are estimated from elevation changes derived from 10.5 years (Greenland) [1992-2002] … of satellite radar altimetry data from the European Remote-sensingSatellites ERS-1 and -2. The Greenland ice sheet is thinning at the margins (–42 ± 2 Gt/yr–1 below the equilibrium-line altitude (ELA)) and growing inland (+53 ± 2 Gt/yr–1 above the ELA) witha small overall mass gain (+11  ± 3 Gt/yr–1; –0.03 mm a–1SLE (sea-level equivalent)).”
The subsequent Greenland warming trend (1995 – present) after 50 or 60 years of cooling has been characterized as smaller in magnitude and rapidity when compared to the 1920s and 1930s warming trend.
Box et al., 2009
“Meteorological station records and regional climate model output are combined to develop a continuous 168-yr (1840–2007) spatial reconstruction of monthly, seasonal, and annual mean Greenland ice sheet near-surface air temperatures. The annual whole ice sheet 1919–32 warming trend is 33% greater in magnitude than the 1994–2007 warming.”

Since 2007, Greenland temperature trends have been flat (as shown below in Lim et al., 2016), indicating that the current warm period in Greenland has apparently plateaued and not superseded the early 20th century warming.
Lim et al., 2016

 
Finally, below are a few graphs of the last few thousand years which indicate that modern Greenland temperatures are not unprecedented, and in fact modern temperatures are still some of the coldest of the Holocene.
Levy et al., 2013  (Greenland Ice Sheet)

Lecavalier et al., 2013 (North Greenland)

Larsen et al., 2015   (Southern Greenland)
“Southern Greenland proxy-inferred atmospheric temperatures also peaked between ca. 7 and 4 cal. kyr B.P. at 2–4 °C higher than present“

"The Morrison government should spend $3.3bn over 10 years on renewable energy and $500m over two years on capital grants to improve energy efficiency and management, according to the Australian Industry Group. The peak employer body made the calls in its pre-budget submission, released on Monday, which also proposes it bring forward income tax cuts, cut business tax, extend the coronavirus supplement on jobseeker and make a further round of $750 payments to households. Ai Group warned that Australia was facing a “substantial and costly increase in climate-related impacts and risks” even under the “best possible scenario for global mitigation”. The submission follows a statement from 10 business, industry, farming and environmental leaders warning Australia is “woefully unprepared” for the impact of climate change over the coming decades. Ai Group suggested national cabinet take a role coordinating climate policies to ensure the most effective response and “build a new energy advantage for Australia in a net-zero emissions world”. Australia should conduct a biannual assessment of national climate change vulnerability and make reducing the financial risks from climate change a “core priority” for financial regulators, it said. AiGroup called for an improvement in energy efficiency through spending on public housing, private housing, commercial building and manufacturing upgrades. It called for “at least” $3.3bn over 10 years for the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and for “additional funding” for the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. “The Australian government should allocate $500m over two years for capital grants to rapidly scale up the penetration of existing technologies that are uncommon in the Australian market,” it said. Those include electrification of processes, heat pumps, electric induction furnaces, and energy management systems such as technology that enables demand response. The federal budget to be delivered by the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, in October comes in the midst of the Covid-19 recession, the first in 30 years and the worst since the Great Depression. The budget is expected to show a deterioration from the deficit of $184.5bn projected in July, due to the second wave of coronavirus cases in Victoria and extended stage-four lockdown in Melbourne. The budget will also set out job creation initiatives on top of the $314bn of direct stimulus or increased lending from the federal government and Reserve Bank. Frydenberg has confirmed the government is considering the timing of the second and third stage of income tax cuts, due to start in 2022 and 2024. Ai Group submitted that lifting the upper threshold of the 19% tax rate from $37,000 to $45,000 and reducing the tax rate on incomes between $45,000 and $90,000 from 32.5% to 30% from 2021 would “increase take-home pay and household spending”. AiGroup said the 25% company tax rate due to take effect for small businesses with less than $50m turnover should be extended to all companies earning less than $1bn. The move would be a massive expansion of company tax cuts passed in the 45th parliament only after big businesses were excluded. The budget presents an opportunity to ... rectify the underlying weaknesses in the economy Ai Group called for a range of measures to boost employment including “broad wage support” for businesses to hire new apprentices, trainees, cadets and interns and more funding for vocational education and training. Ai Group supported the “dual rate of jobkeeper” lowering payments for those working part-time hours. But it proposed that the coronavirus supplement, set to be cut from $550 a fortnight to $250 from September to December, should be extended in line with jobkeeper until the end of March. The chief executive of AiGroup, Innes Willox, said: “For the near term, measures are clearly required to assist and secure the recovery of activity, investment and employment in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis.“The budget also presents an opportunity to act on measures that will rectify the underlying weaknesses in the economy that were evident prior to the onset of the Covid-19 crisis.” Leading into the budget, the Australian Council of Trade Unions has campaigned on a platform sharing some elements with employers including wage subsidies for apprentices, support for the tourism and hospitality sector and renewable energy to support manufacturing. Unlike big business, the ACTU has also called for an extension of free childcare and increased federal government spending on public housing."
"I watched the Republican National Convention last week. It’s becoming harder to put into words the dread that many of us feel. What’s really happening? Toxic levels of corruption and collusion are devouring the US. Christian extremists want to turn the country into a religious state straight out of The Handmaid’s Tale.  After bombarding us with media campaigns pressuring us not to wear masks in March and April, the US now accounts for 22% of all Covid-19 deaths worldwide. I personally know three New Yorkers who died in April, I believe as a result of this official guidance. Trump has stoked racist police violence in the US to even more atrocious heights. Scaring voters with fake tales of impending anarchy and “dark shadows”, he then promises that if re-elected he will crush BLM protesters and “restore law and order”. Is he getting this stuff from Steve Bannon or Mein Kampf? Probably both. Trump is hosting federal executions in the countdown to the election as another prong of his racist, fake “law and order” platform. Last Wednesday, the US government defied Navajo tribal sovereignty and executed Lezmond Mitchell, injecting him with a massive quantity of pentobarbital in a death chamber in Indiana. Behind this curtain of carefully orchestrated chaos, the network of corporate lobbyists that form the core of the GOP pillage the US Treasury and dismantle scores of environmental regulations, driving the country and the world even more hopelessly into global boiling and mass extinction. Australian-born Rupert Murdoch blares his obscene propaganda into American homes, hypnotising viewers with lies, rage and fear-mongering. Meanwhile, 40,000 square miles of Australian wilderness burned last summer, killing over a billion animals. More than half of the Great Barrier Reef has collapsed in the last five years due to rapidly increasing ocean temperatures. The same kinds of awful, permanent losses are engulfing nature on every continent. For many people, economic suffering looms while Amazon, Facebook, Google, Tesla, Apple and others expand their global footprints, sucking dry local economies. Some of the CEOs pour the wealth of the world into colonial space programs. They fantasise that they might finally shed their dependence upon Mother Earth and become the heroic creators and patent-holders of life on Mars. Unlike the Koch brothers, who paid for the malevolent spread of climate change denial, today’s tech billionaires scent themselves with a pheromone of liberal philanthropy while monetising the dismantling of checks and balances that once helped to protect us. They take meetings with Trump, provide him with the viral platforms he needs to retain the presidency, advertise themselves as having done the opposite, and then hedge their bets in private. Huge swaths of California’s ancient redwood forests continue to burn around the perimeter of Silicon Valley. Incessant, nihilistic assaults on truth, empathy and the biosphere ensure that life on earth will become much, much worse. On the campaign trail in 2016, Trump’s team described him as the first presidential candidate since Harry Truman with “the guts” to “drop the bomb”. Trump stood there, grinning with pride, and a wave of nausea spread through me. I had the same feeling a few months ago, when I heard Trump utter the words “the Chinese virus”. What waits for us on the other side of this is a world undone by endless cataclysm and aching with senseless loss. The sound of this track, RNC 2020, is pretty rough. The loop is from a concert I did at a club in New York City in my early 20s. So that’s me screaming in the past … for the present. Can you visualize a different path forward? We all have to focus on this now, with everything we’ve got."
"Coronavirus restrictions have caused Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions to fall to their lowest level since 1998, the latest official data suggests. National emissions in the June quarter 2020 were estimated to be 8% – or about 10m tonnes of carbon dioxide – lower than a year earlier.  The energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, said the reductions in preliminary data to June had been caused by “unsustainable restrictions on Australians’ livelihoods and freedom to travel”, including a 79% reduction in emissions caused by jet fuel. Emissions from petrol were also down 26% in June, compared to the previous year. “With the impacts of Covid-19 restrictions being felt across the economy, emissions have reduced as expected,” Taylor said. The figures, released by the Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources, give preliminary results to the end of June and official data to March. Emissions data to March 2020, which largely accounts for the period before the coronavirus pandemic and associated restrictions, showed a 1.4% reduction to national emissions – a total reduction of 7.7m tonnes. Taylor said the amount was 14.3% below the 2005 levels used as a baseline to calculate Paris emissions reductions targets. Taylor’s statement said emissions from electricity generation were in “long-term structural decline” and reduced by another 4.2% in the year to March 2020. Reflecting the lingering impact of the drought, agricultural emissions were also down 5.5% in the quarter. However emissions from exports continued to increase (up 1.9%), mainly fuelled by an 11% increase to LNG exports. A recent analysis found that Australia’s greenhouse gas accounting underestimates national emissions by about 10%, largely due to a failure to properly recognise the impact of methane released during gas production. It found that if the methane emitted in Australia was measured according to the latest science it would increase annual emissions by more than 50m tonnes a year, the equivalent of Sweden’s total carbon pollution. The Morrison government has been championing a gas-led recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. But last week, leading scientists released a letter to the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, warning his advocacy for increased use of gas-fired electricity was at odds with the Paris agreement and not consistent with a plan to secure a safe climate. Taylor said that when the national emissions were adjusted to remove emissions generated by exports, the reduction on 2005 levels was 32%. The statement said this “reflects the continuing decarbonisation of Australia’s domestic economy”. The minister also repeated his claim – regularly accompanying the release of emissions data – that Australia’s LNG emissions have the potential to cut global emissions in importing countries by up to 169m tonnes a year. As the Guardian has reported, this figure is based on a back-of-envelope calculation and not an analysis of whether gas is being used to replace coal."
"Soon our elected representatives will be asked to vote on Senator Wong’s Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme.
This scheme is not about carbon or pollution. Its main effect is to provide for a cap on the human production of carbon dioxide, a colourless harmless natural gas. Carbon dioxide is no more a pollutant than oxygen or water, the other two atmospheric gases on which all life on earth relies.
The bill will also levy a tax on whatever carbon dioxide is produced, and levy an excess production tax on anyone whose production exceeds the legal cap. It is a carbon dioxide Cap-n-Tax Bill.

"**Hong Kong's protesters have welcomed a new decade via a New Year's Day rally, with tens of thousands joining a pro-democracy march.**
Though the gathering was largely peaceful, violence broke out in some areas and police fired tear gas.
On New Year's Eve, demonstrators had formed human chains that stretched for miles down busy shopping streets.
More than six months after the protests began, they gathered for midnight countdowns by Victoria Harbour.
Their chants included, ""Ten! Nine! Liberate Hong Kong, revolution now!""
In the lively Mong Kok market district, some set fire to barricades after dark and let off fireworks, disrupting traffic.
Police used water cannon to clear Nathan Road in Mong Kok and fired tear gas and rubber bullets, the South China Morning Post reports.
Some 40 parliamentarians and dignitaries from 18 countries sent an open letter to Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam on New Year's Eve, urging her to ""seek genuine ways forward out of this crisis by addressing the grievances of Hong Kong people"".
The anti-government protests began in June over plans to allow extradition to mainland China, but have since morphed into a broader movement demanding full democracy.
Some protesters have adopted the motto: ""Five demands, not one less!""
Their goals are an amnesty for those arrested, an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality, universal suffrage, and for the protests not to be characterised as ""riots"". The fifth demand - the withdrawal of the controversial extradition bill - has already been met.
Hong Kong was a British colony until 1997, but was then returned to Chinese control under the principle of ""one country, two systems"". While it is technically part of China, the territory has its own legal system and borders, and rights including freedom of assembly and free speech are protected.
More than 6,500 people have been arrested as a result of the protests so far.
In the afternoon of New Year's Day, people of all ages gathered to march from the city's Victoria Park. Some wore masks, defying a ban on face coverings, and carried signs reading, ""Freedom is not free"".
""It's hard to utter 'Happy New Year' because Hong Kong people are not happy,"" said a man named Tung, according to Reuters news agency. ""Unless the five demands are achieved, and police are held accountable for their brutality, then we can't have a real happy new year.""
The pro-democracy march was organised by the Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF), which has planned a number of million-strong rallies.
""The government has already started the oppression before the New Year began... whoever is being oppressed, we will stand with them,"" said Jimmy Sham, a CHRF leader and long-time political activist.
Mr Sham was hospitalised in October after he was attacked by a group of men wielding hammers.
In a speech on New Year's Day, China's President Xi Jinping said Beijing would ""resolutely safeguard the prosperity and stability"" of Hong Kong."
"Every year since 1994, the UN has gathered together the world’s governments at its Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) conference of the parties (COP), held in a different country each time. The convention’s ultimate aim is to prevent “dangerous” human interference with the climate system. The onus is on developed countries to lead the way and the convention directs funds to developing countries to help them in their efforts. COP25, held in Madrid at the beginning of December 2019, did not end well. Swedish youth activist Greta Thunberg’s solemn speech gave short shrift to countries neglecting their responsibilities, and the likes of the US President, Donald Trump, and Brazil’s President, Jair Bolsonaro, responded with personal attacks.  Tensions ran high when climate justice activists were barred from entering the venue and talks stalled, and negotiations ending two days late with a compromise deal on cutting global carbon emissions. Given the raised status of the world’s climate emergency, it was a disappointing end to a conference for which many had high hopes. In the cold light of a new year, everyone from activists to world leaders are reflecting on COP25’s ultimate failure to set down rules on creating a carbon market between countries. But already, behind the scenes, the UK is looking to the next summit – because this year COP26 will be pitching its tent in Glasgow. More than 30,000 people are expected to descend on the city in November 2020. For those who live and work in Glasgow it will be a chance to experience being part of an important climate action event. People from around the country will be able to participate in hundreds of events that will be happening across the city. So why will COP26 be such a big occasion for Glasgow, and what will the city itself bring to the mix? The world’s governments have met every year for nearly three decades to (try to) agree how to stop – or at least reduce the impacts of – climate change. But the fact that these nations have not been able to meet the overall UNFCCC objectives is one of the reasons we now face a global climate emergency. As world summits go, they don’t get much more important than the UN’s climate change convention. In those three decades, this will be the first time a COP summit has been held in the UK. From a policy perspective, COP26 will be important for at least four reasons: 1. It will take place in the year when all countries are asked to submit their new long-term goals – so ambition to address the global climate emergency will be high on the agenda. 2. It will have to finish the work that COP25 was unable able to conclude – setting out the rules for a carbon market between countries. 3. From Glasgow onwards, the implementation of the 2015 Paris Agreement will be the key driver of international climate action. 4. COP26 will come just weeks after the US presidential election with the potential implications this will have for US climate policy and US participation in COP26. Come November 2020, the eyes of the world will be firmly on Glasgow. Scotland has a long and rich history of discovery and innovation, including Glasgow’s past as a world-class centre of shipbuilding, trade and industrial production – a legacy that has contributed to greenhouse gas emissions but has also added much to the quality of human life. From pioneering work on the steam engine and wind turbines, to the invention of television and the life-saving introduction of sterile surgery, gin and tonic and Billy Connolly’s shipyard humour, Glasgow has helped shape the modern world. Glasgow and its history can also shed light on how cities, societies and people can reinvent themselves from a former industrial workhorse to a city of culture, services and new green technologies. Scotland’s collective commitment to net-zero emissions of all greenhouse gases by 2045 now puts the country at the forefront of real action on the climate emergency. During COP26, Glasgow’s research and innovation will be on show to the world.  Engineers are leading the development of renewable technologies such as tidal energy and floating offshore wind turbines. Scotland is at the forefront of establishing hydrogen as a viable energy source, providing hubs for related skills and knowledge-sharing, to ensure that new technologies can be integrated into the grid and controlled. Scotland also leads the way not only on the science innovation, but on ways in which research and development can provide community-informed solutions to sea and climate change challenges, and on how climate change relates to Scotland’s coastline and islands.  Researchers in Scotland are also at the forefront of the science-policy-practice interface, working with people in the field to deliver climate change risk and adaptation policies. And with climate change already a reality, Glasgow is also producing science that helps communities become more prepared and resilient.  Glasgow’s experts and innovators will have their moment to shine at COP26 – a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to connect with those deciding the direction and effectiveness of the global debate on climate change action. COP26 Glasgow can also be an inspirational event for Scotland’s young people, the generation which will inherit both the burden of climate change and the means to address it. As we build up to COP26, the Scottish government and Glasgow City Council, alongside the universities of Strathclyde, Glasgow and Glasgow Caledonian, will be planning numerous events that will run alongside the main COP26 activities. The countdown has begun. Glasgow will seek to demonstrate to the world how Scottish research and innovation is playing an important role in tackling the global climate emergency."
"The bushfire royal commission says a manager from the ABC should be stationed in the emergency management headquarters of every state and territory during a national disaster to ensure the “timely delivery of critical information to the public”. The suggestion was made in the inquiry’s interim report, released on Monday, which also highlighted inconsistencies and deficiencies in fire warning systems and state-funded fire apps.  “The Australian Broadcasting Corporation, alongside community radio, is acknowledged as a trusted broadcaster of emergency messages and warnings,” the report said. “ABC managers are embedded in some but not all emergency centres. To assist with the timely delivery of critical information to the public, we see a need for all state and territory emergency response organisations to consistently embed ABC managers within state and territory emergency management centres.” An ABC spokesman said the broadcaster already embedded staff within emergency centre operations “when both organisations feel it is appropriate to do so”. The ABC would continue this practice in consultation with emergency services management, he said. The 1,700 submissions and 50,000 pages of documents presented to the inquiry included research that found 60% of people in bushfire-affected areas said information provided by the ABC helped ensure their safety, and half used it as their main source of information during the fires. The interim report, which the royal commission said would not include any recommendations, was published on Monday after the final report was pushed back to 28 October, well into the start of the southern fire season. The inquiry has heard from 290 witnesses to date, with a final week of hearings scheduled for 21 September. The interim observations said that bushfire mapping data was so inconsistent and incompatible between jurisdictions in Australia the commission still does not know the true size of the 2019-2020 bushfires. Instead, it gave an estimate for the total area burned as between 24 and 40m hectares. “While there have been large fire seasons in the past, the 2019-2020 season set a new benchmark for an extreme fire season in Australia’s temperate forests,” it said. “Government agencies and non-government organisations have struggled to provide a full and clear picture of the devastating impact of these bushfires, in part because of inconsistencies in how data about natural disasters are collected, collated and shared across the nation.” The interim report hinted at future recommendations, which included using the national cabinet model to manage natural disasters, with a bushfire advisory body performing a similar role to that performed during the Covid-19 pandemic by the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee. It said there was a need for further education and research on the effectiveness of prescribed burning and other fuel reduction strategies under catastrophic bushfire conditions, saying that while such mitigation strategies can ameliorate bushfire behaviours and increase the potential for suppression, “these activities will not eliminate bushfire risk”. Further warming of the Australian climate over the next 20 years “appears to be inevitable,” it said, meaning that catastrophic bushfire conditions will become more common and traditional bushfire protection models and firefighting techniques will be “less effective”. The royal commission was explicitly asked to look at mitigation options, but not drivers of global heating. An estimated 3 billion native animals were killed in the 2019-2020 fires, but the inquiry said there were “significant information gaps” on wildlife and threatened species, and that the fires highlighted a “need for action to ensure greater consistency and collaboration in the collection, storage, access and provision of environmental information”. The interim report also suggested Australia should have a “single, scalable standing body responsible for natural disaster recovery and resilience” rather than disaster-specific recovery bodies established after the fact. And it said there is a case for offering ongoing support for firefighting volunteers who are taken away from their regular employment for extended periods, rather than the one-off payments offered to New South Wales volunteers this summer. On aerial firefighting, it said Australia could invest in a “modest, Australian-based sovereign [very large aerial tanker/large aerial tanker] capability” as the climate emergency means that northern and southern hemisphere fire seasons are running together. Australia is currently reliant on the United States for large aerial firefighting aircraft – only one large aerial tanker is permanently based in Australia. It also called for reviews of the national warning and national fire danger systems, which differ between states in a way that caused confusion in the devastating 2019-2020 bushfire season, to be completed “as a priority”. That could include changing the name of the middle alert level. “We have heard that the middle-level warning, ‘Watch and Act’, causes confusion –could it mean ‘wait and see’ or ‘act now’?” the report said. The Australasian Fire and Emergency Service Authorities Council (AFAC) has been developing a national all-disaster warning system for six years, a process the inquiry said was “taking too long” and was an example of the need for a clearer national decision-making process. The fire danger rating system has also been under review, with a view to making it national and more accurate for six years. It said that upgrading the communications equipment used by firefighters and other first responders should also be considered a priority because, at the moment, firefighters from different states working on the same fire can’t easily talk to each other. That could include investing in public safety mobile broadband capability to provide an emergency network through which firefighters can upload maps and share essential modelling data when other networks are down. The cost of buying that additional mobile broadband spectrum should be shared by state and territory governments, it said."
"**A four-day siege of Hong Kong's Polytechnic University (PolyU) is nearing an end, although dozens of protesters remain inside.**
Around 800 to 900 protesters have already left the campus, hundreds of whom were under 18, police said.
The campus - which turned into a fiery battleground during the past week - is surrounded by police who are arresting for rioting any adults trying to leave.
Some are too scared to leave as a result, leaving them trapped inside.
The campus siege has been one of the most dramatic confrontations in the wider protest movement that has paralysed the city for more than five months.
Triggered by a now-withdrawn controversial bill, the movement has at its root a fear - especially among young people - that their unique identity is under threat from China.
Hong Kong is a part of China, but as a former British colony enjoys freedoms not seen on the mainland.
Meanwhile, the US Senate has passed a bill which could strip Hong Kong of its special trade status if it fails to uphold democracy and human rights - though it still needs approval from President Donald Trump.
The bill was swiftly condemned by China, which accused the US of ""blatantly"" interfering in Hong Kong affairs.
PolyU has over the past week become a fiery battleground between protesters and police officers.
Police have fired tear gas and rubber bullets in and around the campus, while protesters have thrown petrol bombs and bricks from makeshift sling-shots, and fired arrows from bows.
The protesters have been camping inside the campus, using it as a fortress, but many are hungry and cold.
One pro-democracy lawmaker who visited the university on Tuesday said he did not think supplies could last another day.
Over the past few days, a stream of protesters have been trickling out, surrendering to police or as part of medical evacuations. Some have eye injuries and hypothermia.
School headmasters, politicians and religious leaders have gone in to convince many to leave.
Others have tried to avoid police detection, making desperate escape attempts.
On Monday night, some climbed down ropes from a bridge, escaping on motorcycles that were waiting on the road underneath.
Some even unsuccessfully tried to make their way out using the sewers. Those captured by police were arrested.
Police arrested around 1,100 people in and around PolyU on Tuesday alone, they said at a late night briefing.
Those under 18 had their particulars noted down but were not immediately detained.
Those over 18 were arrested. They could be charged with rioting, which carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison.
Hong Kong's Hospital Authority said 325 people, aged 15 to 66, were injured and sent to hospital on Tuesday. One is in critical condition.
The protests started after the government planned to pass a bill that would allow suspects to be extradited to mainland China.
Many feared this would undermine the city's freedoms and judicial independence.
The bill was eventually withdrawn, but the demonstrations continued, having evolved into a broader protest against alleged police brutality, and the way Hong Kong is administered by Beijing.
Hong Kong is a former British colony but was handed back to China in 1997. It has rights not seen on the mainland including freedom of assembly and freedom of speech.
But the freedoms enshrined in Hong Kong's mini constitution - the Basic Law - expire in 2047 and it is not clear what Hong Kong's status will then be.

"Thanks to the climate crisis, we are fast approaching the “point of no return”, according to world leaders. We are also in the midst of the sixth mass extinction. And the state of worldwide land degradation has also reached a critical level: ever-increasing demands for food production, urbanisation and economic development have led to large and extensive land conversion. All of these issues are, of course, interconnected. Across the world, we are seeing severe drought and water scarcity, soil erosion and contamination, soil organic matter and nutrient depletion, acidity and salinity, disruption of hydrological and biological cycles, and species extinctions. All these issues place unprecedented pressure on finite land resources over the planet. An astonishing 33% of the world’s land is moderately or highly degraded and in urgent need of restoration. Land degradation is globally recognised as a major contributor to global warming. The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) estimated in 2018 that 10% of human-induced greenhouse gas emissions derive from deforestation alone.  Even this is probably an underestimate: soils are disturbed during and after deforestation, and the carbon previously stored in the soil is subsequently released in the form of CO₂, further driving global warming. Soils are capable of holding three times as much carbon as the atmosphere; they are fundamental to mitigate climate change. Given the high potential and importance of soils and woody biomass to store carbon and offer numerous ecosystem services that are vital to all life, planting trees is often advocated as the most cost-effective way to keep global warming under 2°C and an urgent priority to prevent, reduce and reverse land degradation and to avoid conflict and migration. There is much support for this approach from national policymakers. It’s brilliant that the tide seems to be turning, and the value of land is being recognised again. But we must be careful about how reforestation takes place, as there’s no such thing as a free lunch.  For example, lands subject to certain climatic and ecological circumstances have a very limited amount of water to support tree growth. In general, the more water available for tree growth, the larger trees grow and the more carbon they store. It’s obvious, then, that a close relationship exists between water and the carbon cycle. But water is, of course, not infinite in non-humid regions. Social and ecological water demands compete with each other for water. In such cases, if the ecological water demand from new forests is much higher than the capacity of ecosystems to deliver it sustainably, the social water demand is likely to be compromised. This may cause water use conflicts and water scarcity. This is not purely conjectural: it has already proved a problem in parts of the world that have already embarked on ambitious tree-planting projects.  In China, for example, an enormous investment has been made by central and local governments to plant trees since the late 1970s. Today, China plans to increase its forest coverage rate to 23% by 2020, to 26% by 2035, and to 42% by 2050. This is not just a state effort: private companies, Alibaba and Alipay, the e-commerce giant and global leader of mobile payment, aims to invest US$28 million into tree-planting projects. As a result, total forest area in the Asia-Pacific region has been increased by more than 17 million hectares over 25 years owing to afforestation: the establishment of new forests. These new forests are mostly in China due to the country’s afforestation investment strategy. In a targeted area the size of France – the Loess Plateau – the forest cover doubled from 50,000 to 100,000 km² between 2001 and 2016. But while China becomes greener, the health of freshwater system deteriorates. A recent study my colleagues and I conducted on China’s afforestation effort provides evidence that replacing natural grass vegetation with unmanaged artificial black locust plantations – a fast-growing non-local species – for soil conservation and carbon sequestration has significantly changed the water availability as well as whole water cycle.  Black locust plantations – which make up the bulk of the China afforestation – are much more thirsty than natural grassland. They use 92% of annual rainfall (700mm in a wet year) for biomass growth, leaving only 8% of annual rainfall for human uses. As a result, not enough water remains to recharge groundwater or flow into rivers and lakes. We found that deep percolation (the water moving from root zone into groundwater) in years with average or lower-than-average rainfall can be expected to be close to zero.  Our findings support the mounting evidence indicating that planting forests is resulting in substantial reduction in river discharge and freshwater availability in northern China. Forest plantations deplete soil water, reduce surface runoff and streamflow through enhanced water consumption, thereby intensifying water scarcity.  The discharge of China’s second-largest river (the Yellow River) and its tributaries have significantly decreased in comparison to pre-afforestation time. This is alarming for the health of the river and regional water security. It could affect the wellbeing of 108 million people living in the Yellow River Basin and 400 million people living further downstream.  There are persistent misconceptions about the role of tree-planting in regulating and providing water among scientists, land managers, policymakers and the public. China’s afforestation efforts should be a warning to other nations considering how to establish new forests, because global and national long‐term greening efforts in areas with land degradation, water shortage and drought problems must not compromise the safety of water supply at local and regional levels.  Rewilding and afforestation are good intentions to stop soil erosion, enrich soil organic matter and nutrients, preserve biodiversity and increase carbon stock. But choice of less thirsty trees and better forest management are required to lower the water needs of trees and ensure water security. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter.

You’ve heard of the Holocene, and the Anthropocene…
The ‘Anthropocene‘ is a term widely used since its coining by Paul Crutzen and Eugene Stoermer in 2000 to denote the present time interval, in which many geologically significant conditions and processes are profoundly altered by human activities.
Well, hold onto your hats, er data.. Josh writes: Thanks to Robert B who thought up a great name for the era of climate science we are currently enduring…

– The Adjustocene, where no one will ever know what the temperature is.

Guest essay by Eric Worrall
Legendary businessman Warren Buffet has waded into the climate issue, with his latest letter to Berkshire Hathaway investors. Buffet seems to believe climate change is likely to be a serious issue – but he is cautious about this belief. Naturally everyone is interpreting Buffet’s words to suit their own position.
I am writing this section because we have a proxy proposal regarding climate change to consider at this year’s annual meeting. The sponsor would like us to provide a report on the dangers that this change might present to our insurance operation and explain how we are responding to these threats.
It seems highly likely to me that climate change poses a major problem for the planet. I say “highly likely” rather than “certain” because I have no scientific aptitude and remember well the dire predictions of most “experts” about Y2K. It would be foolish, however, for me or anyone to demand 100% proof of huge forthcoming damage to the world if that outcome seemed at all possible and if prompt action had even a small chance of thwarting the danger.
This issue bears a similarity to Pascal’s Wager on the Existence of God. Pascal, it may be recalled, argued that if there were only a tiny probability that God truly existed, it made sense to behave as if He did because the rewards could be infinite whereas the lack of belief risked eternal misery.
Likewise, if there is only a 1% chance the planet is heading toward a truly major disaster and delay means passing a point of no return, inaction now is foolhardy. Call this Noah’s Law: If an ark may be essential for survival, begin building it today, no matter how cloudless the skies appear.
It’s understandable that the sponsor of the proxy proposal believes Berkshire is especially threatened by climate change because we are a huge insurer, covering all sorts of risks. The sponsor may worry that property losses will skyrocket because of weather changes. And such worries might, in fact, be warranted if we wrote ten- or twenty-year policies at fixed prices. But insurance policies are customarily written for one year and repriced annually to reflect changing exposures. Increased possibilities of loss translate promptly into increased premiums.
Think back to 1951 when I first became enthused about GEICO. The company’s average loss-per-policy was then about $30 annually. Imagine your reaction if I had predicted then that in 2015 the loss costs would increase to about $1,000 per policy. Wouldn’t such skyrocketing losses prove disastrous, you might ask? Well, no.
Over the years, inflation has caused a huge increase in the cost of repairing both the cars and the humans involved in accidents. But these increased costs have been promptly matched by increased premiums. So, paradoxically, the upward march in loss costs has made insurance companies far more valuable. If costs had remained unchanged, Berkshire would now own an auto insurer doing $600 million of business annually rather than one doing $23 billion.
Up to now, climate change has not produced more frequent nor more costly hurricanes nor other weather- related events covered by insurance. As a consequence, U.S. super-cat rates have fallen steadily in recent years, which is why we have backed away from that business. If super-cats become costlier and more frequent, the likely – though far from certain – effect on Berkshire’s insurance business would be to make it larger and more profitable.
As a citizen, you may understandably find climate change keeping you up nights. As a homeowner in a low-lying area, you may wish to consider moving. But when you are thinking only as a shareholder of a major insurer, climate change should not be on your list of worries.

If adapting to or mitigating climate change was cost free, I would be an enthusiast – embracing free protection from an unlikely risk is a no brainer. But actions advocated by climate enthusiasts all have a cost, which has frequently been admitted to be in the trillions of dollars.
Even if alarmists are right about climate sensitivity to CO2, does global warming have the potential to make the world uninhabitable? I suggest the historic record strongly indicates that the answer is no.
A 2c warmer world, even a 4c warmer world, would still be habitable, perhaps more than habitable; life would likely be far more abundant, than today’s world. Wild predictions of lonely survivors clinging to existence on the edge of Antarctica are nonsense.
We know this, because in geologically recent times, the world was that warm. The Cretaceous Period, which lasted for 80 million years, and ended 66 million years ago, had a CO2 level of around 1700ppm, and was 4c hotter than today’s world. The dinosaurs didn’t eke out an existence in a barren scorching desert – their world was a lush, tropical world of jungles, giant trees, and super abundant life. So the risk that the Earth will become uninhabitable in the next few centuries, due to anthropogenic CO2, is essentially zero.
Next we have to consider other risks, the opportunity cost of chasing the climate dragon. What do we lose, which we could have had, if we hadn’t spent a trillion dollars building wind turbines?
As the recent Chelyabinsk Meteor showed, as countless asteroid strikes throughout the Earth’s history has shown, there is a very real risk of a catastrophic encounter with a large meteor. The probability in a given year of the Earth being struck by a dangerous meteor is very low – but a really large meteor actually could end civilisation, or could even end all life on Earth.
The Cretaceous Period ended because the Earth was struck by a gigantic meteor, which blackened the skies – eventually killing 75% of all living species on Earth. What would have happened if the meteor was a little larger? Would Earth’s biosphere have been returned to a primitive primordial soup, with tough single-celled organisms clinging to life on a barren, blasted world? Or worse, could the atmosphere itself have been swept into space by the impact, leaving an unbreathable mix of volcanic sulphates and ash?
Of course, you don’t need a dinosaur killer to end civilisation. Much smaller meteors pose a significant threat. For example, the East Mediterranean Event, a nuclear scale meteoric blast which occurred in 2002, occurred during a period of heightened tension between India and Pakistan. If the meteor had struck a few hours later, over India or Pakistan, it could have been mistaken for a first strike, and triggered a nuclear war.
If we bankrupt the world by chasing climate fears, we won’t have any cash left over for a meteor defence system.
There is a long list of other problems which could use some of that trillion dollars climate cash; disease, poverty, desperation, hunger, all of which would be ignored, if the world committed every available resource to building wind turbines.
Disease should be an especial concern for Westerners. The recent Ebola epidemic came very close to spreading beyond Africa. The period between infection and symptoms is frighteningly long. While it has been claimed that such a disease couldn’t spread in the West, I’m not sure I believe such claims. Many Western cities are host to large slums, which are every bit as filthy and degraded as the run down urban slums of Africa – think the Favelas in Rio, or the run down skid row slums in some North American cities.
Ebola potentially poses a far worse threat, than has currently been realised to date. In some animals, such as pigs, Ebola is an airborne disease. In humans it isn’t airborne, though there is some question about this, it is more likely marginally airborne. Ebola might be be frighteningly close to mutating into a fully airborne strain in humans, to becoming a flu like disease which eventually kills high percentages of its victims. Diseases like Swine flu frequently make the evolutionary leap, from pigs to humans – could Ebola do the same?
If we spend all our money on wind turbines, we don’t have any cash left to fund early warning for dangerous diseases.
I could go on, but I think you see my point. As long as climate change is having no impact on our life, as long as there is serious uncertainty about whether it will ever have a significant impact on our life, there are far more urgent, immediate problems which deserve our attention.
If in 200 years, our descendants discover the weather is becoming worse, thanks to CO2 emissions in the early 21st century, as far as I’m concerned it is their problem. Manipulating the weather and climate will be child’s play, to people who will inevitably master technology, science, and planetary scale engineering capabilities which we today can only dream of. If they’re not happy with my position on this issue, they can sue me.

"I study insects for a living, and bumblebees are by far my favourite. They’re the most charismatic and friendly critters you’re likely to see out and about. 
Sadly, your chances of seeing a bumblebee in Europe and North America have dropped by a third since 1970, according to new research.  Across Europe, we have 68 species of bumblebee, but rising global temperatures and unpredictable weather have forced some to abandon southern regions. As a result, roughly half of these species are in decline, with 16 already endangered. Many of these species are found in only a handful of places, like Bombus hyperboreus, which only lives in Scandinavian tundra. As the climate changes, these bees will be left with nowhere to go and could die out altogether.  Their thick, fuzzy jackets and loud drone set these bees apart from other insects, and they’re a familiar sight across much of the world. There are even tropical bumblebees that can be found in the Amazon rainforest. But what might a world without them look like? Over three-quarters of the world’s crops benefit from insect pollination, valued at USD$235-577bn annually. Out of the 124 staple crops grown for human consumption, 70% depend on insect pollination. Though the plight of honeybees tends to draw the most attention, recent research suggests that bumblebees are far more efficient pollinators. They are bigger and hairier and so can carry more pollen. They also groom themselves less and can transfer pollen more effectively to fertilise plants. They behave differently around flowers, moving methodically to cover each flower in a patch, whereas honeybees tend to move randomly between flowers in a patch. Bumblebees are also hardier than honeybees and will continue to pollinate under strong winds or rain. We could still grow food without bumblebees, but we might struggle to get enough and our diet wouldn’t be as diverse.  Bumblebees are masters of “buzz pollination”. They can vibrate at a particularly high frequency (as much as 400Hz) near flowers, to release pollen that’s otherwise hard to reach. Bumblebees are among a small minority of pollinating insects that can do this, and tomatoes, potatoes and blueberries rely on it to reproduce. Like honeybees, bumbles are social creatures and live in hives. They are ruled by a single queen who is supported by her daughters (the workers) and a few sons (drones).  While honeybees typically form hives of around 30,000 individuals, that can be almost as big as a person, bumbles live far more modestly. Their hives host around 100 bees and are small enough to fit in a plant pot. As temperatures rise in early spring, the enormous queens that hibernated underground over winter wake up and search for nectar and pollen, and a suitable nesting site for the year. They aren’t picky – tree hollows, bird boxes and the space beneath garden sheds will all do. Workers guard the nest and forage for the queen, who lays eggs in late summer for male drones and new queens. These both leave to mate with bees from other hives, while new queens feed on pollen and nectar, storing the energy as fat inside their bodies so that they can hibernate through the winter and emerge in spring, to begin the cycle anew. The workers and drones meanwhile die off each winter. Not all bees live in hives and make honey though. The cuckoo bee, for instance, belongs to the bumblebee family, but is something of a black sheep. Cuckoos disguise themselves as other bumblebee species, hide their eggs in their hives, and allow the hard-working hosts to raise and care for them. So well disguised are these parasites that even entomologists struggle to identify them in the wild. While honeybees are generalists and feed on anything they can find, bumblebees tend to have a highly specialised diet, and flowers have evolved close relationships with particular species. Plants like red clover have long, complex flower tubes that only long-tongued species like Bombus hortorum can reach. In highly specialised systems like this, the loss of the plant or the pollinator could lead to the loss of the other, causing a cascade of extinctions.

      Beyond honey bees: Wild bees are also key pollinators, and some species are disappearing


 Climate change isn’t the only threat to bumblebees. Changes in how land is used – more pesticide-rich agriculture, less wild grassland – mean less forage. This has caused massive declines, even fairly recently. Cullum’s humble bumble (Bombus cullumanus) has declined by 80% globally since 2010 But wild bumbles are resilient and respond faster to improvements in their habitat, such as wildflower strips, than honeybees. In the UK, the short-haired bumblebee (Bombus subterraneus) was declared extinct in 2000, but collaboration between the RSPB and Bumblebee Conservation Trust helped reintroduce the species to sites in southern England, near Dungeness and Romney Marsh. If the habitats of species with smaller ranges can be improved and expanded, there’s hope for preventing extinctions as the climate warms. The insect charity Buglife is working on a network of “B-Lines” – wildflower meadow strips that can link up fragments of useful habitat and ensure bumblebees aren’t trapped in these shrinking pockets.  Bumblebees give us a colourful diet of fruit and vegetables through their particular brand of pollination. We owe it to our fuzzy friends to help them survive the great changes that climate change will bring to their world."
"Humans are leaving a heavy footprint on the Earth, but when did we become the main driver of change in the planet’s ecosystems? Many scientists point to the 1950s, when all kinds of socioeconomic trends began accelerating. Since then, the world population has tripled. Fertiliser and water use expanded as more food was grown than ever before. The construction of motorways sped up to accommodate rising car ownership while international flights took off to satisfy a growing taste for tourism.  The scale of human demands on Earth grew beyond historic proportions. This post-war period became known as the “Great Acceleration”, and many believe it gave birth to the Anthropocene – the geological epoch during which human activity surpassed natural forces as the biggest influence on the functioning of Earth’s living systems. But researchers studying the ocean are currently feeling a sense of déjà vu. Over the past three decades, patterns seen on land 70 years ago have been occurring in the ocean. We’re living through a “Blue Acceleration”, and it will have significant consequences for life on the blue planet. As land-based resources have declined, hopes and expectations have increasingly turned to the ocean as a new engine of human development. Take deep sea mining. The international seabed and its mineral riches have excited commercial interest in recent years due to soaring commodity prices. According to the International Monetary Fund, the price of gold is up 454% since 2000, silver is up 317% and lead 493%. Around 1.4 million square kilometres of the seabed has been leased since 2001 by the International Seabed Authority for exploratory mining activities. In some industries, technological advances have driven these trends. Virtually all offshore windfarms were installed in the last 20 years. The marine biotechnology sector scarcely existed at the end of the 20th century, and over 99% of genetic sequences from marine organisms found in patents were registered since 2000. During the 1990s, as the Blue Acceleration got underway, the world population reached 6 billion. Today there are around 7.8 billion people. Population growth in water-scarce areas like the Middle East, Australia and South Africa has caused a three-fold growth in volumes of desalinated seawater generated since 2000. It has also meant a nearly four-fold increase in the volume of goods transported around the world by shipping since 2000.  The ocean was once thought – even among prominent scientists – to be too vast to be changed by human activity. That view has been replaced by the uncomfortable recognition that not only can humans change the ocean, but also that the current trajectory of human demands on the ocean simply isn’t sustainable. Consider the coast of Norway. The region is home to a multi-million dollar ocean-based oil and gas industry, aquaculture, popular cruises, busy shipping routes and fisheries. All of these interests are vying for the same ocean space, and their demands are growing. A five-fold increase in the number of salmon grown by aquaculture is expected by 2050, while the region’s tourism industry is predicted to welcome a five-fold increase in visitors by 2030. Meanwhile, vast offshore wind farms have been proposed off the southern tip of Norway. The ocean is vast, but it’s not limitless. This saturation of ocean space is not unique to Norway, and a densely populated ocean space runs the risk of conflict across industries. Escapee salmon from aquaculture have spread sea lice in wild populations, creating tensions with Norwegian fisheries. An industrial accident in the oil and gas industry could cause significant damage to local seafood and tourism as well as the seafood export market. More fundamentally, the burden on ocean ecosystems is growing, and we simply don’t know as much about these ecosystems as we would like. An ecologist once quipped that fisheries management is the same as forestry management. Instead of trees you’re counting fish, except you can’t see the fish, and they move. Exploitation of the ocean has tended to precede exploration. One iconic example is the scaly-foot snail. This deep sea mollusc was discovered in 1999 and was on the IUCN Red List of endangered species by 2019. Why? As far as scientists can tell, the species is only found in three hydrothermal vent systems more than 2,400 metres below the Indian Ocean, covering less than 0.02 square kilometres. Today, two of the three vent systems fall within exploratory mining leases.

 Billionaires dreaming of space colonies can dream a little closer to home. Even as the Blue Acceleration consumes more of the ocean’s resources, this vast area is every bit as mysterious as outer space. The surfaces of Mars and the Moon have been mapped in higher resolution than the seafloor. Life in the ocean has existed for two billion years longer than on land and an estimated 91% of marine species have not been described by science. Their genetic adaptations could help scientists develop the antibiotics and medicines of tomorrow, but they may disappear long before that’s possible. The timing is right for guiding the Blue Acceleration towards more sustainable and equitable trajectories. The UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development is about to begin, a new international treaty on ocean biodiversity is in its final stages of negotiation, and in June 2020, governments, businesses, academics and civil society will assemble for the UN Ocean Conference in Lisbon. Yet many simple questions remain. Who is driving the Blue Acceleration? Who is benefiting from it? And who is being left out or forgotten? These are all urgent questions, but perhaps the most important and hardest to answer of all is how to create connections and engagement across all these groups. Otherwise, the drivers of the Blue Acceleration will be like the fish in the ecologist’s analogy: constantly moving, invisible and impossible to manage – before it is too late."

Reasonable minds differ on the science of global warming. Even if they didn’t — even if the science were settled — anyone familiar with the federal government’s track record on large‐​scale regulation ought to harbor serious doubts about Washington’s anti‐​climate‐​change efforts. And while climate hysteria dominates the environmental argument within the spheres of politics and science, few realize just how far its influence extends.



In _Climate Coup: Global Warming’s Invasion of Our Government and Our Lives_ , Patrick J. Michaels edits a collection of essays offering shocking insights into the impact of globalwarming alarmism on the law, the scientific peer‐​review process, global security, trade, international economic development, and public education.



Michaels, senior fellow at the Cato Institute and author of _Climate of Extremes: Global Warming Science They Don’t Want You to Know_ , introduces the book’s eight chapters, in which academics and policy experts sketch the landscape of global‐​warming alarmism’s reach. Roger Pilon and Evan Turgeon show how, while James Madison, the father of the Constitution, thought that “the powers of the new government would be ‘few and defined,’ ” the modern executive branch, “in the name of addressing global warming, is able to regulate virtually every human activity in this nation.”



Ross McKitrick offers a cautionary tale of bias within the peer‐​review process that acts as the gatekeeper to the scientific literature. He recounts the two years he spent “trying to publish a paper refuting an important claim in the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report,” a claim that “was not just wrong but was based on fabricated evidence.” He writes, “I did not expect a smooth ride, but the process eventually became surreal.”



Ivan Eland looks at the way the Department of Defense has used global warming as a justification for its own expansion under the umbrella of national security. Sallie James shows how politicians, in an effort to appear active on the climate‐​change issue while not offending special‐​interest groups, have proposed “trade‐​related measures [that] put the United States at risk of retaliation, litigation, or both from its global trading partners.”



Indur M. Goklany argues that developing nations will have little difficulty adapting to rising global temperatures, while Robert E. Davis debunks many of the most pervasive myths about global warming and public health. “The litany of human health impacts from global warming goes on and on,” he writes. “It’s safe to say that these (and other) health impacts either will not happen or will not be nearly as severe as the predictions.” Neal McCluskey ends Climate Coupwith a look at global‐​warming alarmism in public education and its pernicious effects. “When what we will need are rational, well‐​informed adults, what we will get is either people who know little or nothing about climate change or people who are scared to death about it,” he writes.



In his introduction, Michaels offers a striking observation by way of a parade of horribles: “When students are threatened with death from global warming, when our military raises the threat of war from global warming, when the state has the apparatus to run our lives because of global warming without any additional legislation, when our Congress legislates tariffs that could provoke trade wars because of global warming, when the threats of global warming to the developing world are egregiously exaggerated, when the biomedical community hypes unfounded health and mortality fears, and when the scientific peer‐​review process becomes skewed against anything moderate, we have witnessed a coup.”



 _Climate Coup_ exposes the sordid details of this process.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAs the reputed world leader in green energy policy, Germany plans to eliminate nuclear power as an energy source in the next 5 years.
A 2011 decision to phase out nuclear power by 2022  has meant that renewables like wind and solar power are expected to swiftly take the place of nuclear energy on the German power grid.  The portion of Germany’s power generation from wind and solar (renewables) has indeed risen dramatically in the last 10 years:

                                           Image  source  (cleanenergywire.org)
Germany’s vociferous allegiance to renewables as a power generation source has elicited controversy.   Wind and solar are very labor- and material-intensive (expensive) energy sources, and the dramatic rise in solar and wind power capacity has come with great financial expense to German citizens.  Poorer households have long been the most adversely affected.  Dating back to 2000, electricity prices have risen by 80% in Germany, leaving 7 million citizens “energy poor” (meaning that more than 10% of their income has to be spent on heating and electrifying their homes).
Analysis by the European Commission indicates that “nearly 11% of the EU’s population [encompassing 54 million people] are in a situation where they live in  households in which they find themselves unable to heat their homes at an affordable cost,” which may effectively put their lives at risk.   This latter point is not an exaggeration.  In the UK, where heating costs rose 63% between 2009 and 2014, 25% of citizens over 60 are classified as “energy poor”, leaving the elderly population especially vulnerable.  During the frigid winter of 2014, the number of “excess winter deaths” reached 49,260, of which about 14,780  were due to people living in cold homes that they couldn’t afford to heat.
And despite the steep, expensive rise in power generated by renewables since about 2000, Germany still obtained about 44% of its power from coal as of 2014, which is a higher share than in the United States (33% as of 2015).  Hundreds of U.S. coal plants have been shuttered in recent years largely because of a monumental nation-wide shift to natural gas power generation, a cleaner fuel that emits much less CO2 upon combustion than does coal.
(In the U.S., in fact, there has been a 12% decline in overall CO2 emissions since 2005 despite the fact that the U.S population has risen by 30 million during those 10 years.  As mentioned above, much of the decline in emissions is directly connected to the rapid displacement of coal with natural gas power generation.  While the rise in U.S. solar power has also been substantial in the last decade, “for every ton of carbon dioxide cut by solar power, hydraulic fracturing for natural gas cut 13 tons.”)
Germany’s heavy reliance on coal — the highest in the EU —  is very likely to continue indefinitely despite the nation’s stated commitments to the Paris Agreement and CO2 emissions reductions.  The much lower power-generating capabilities of renewables due to their intermittent output (the Sun has to shine and the wind must blow) has meant that reliable backup capacity — fossil fuels or nuclear — must remain on the grid.  Since nuclear power is set to be phased out of Germany by 2022, coal necessarily has to stay, even expand.  The natural consequence is that Germany’s CO2 emissions have not declined since 2009, and instead there has been a slight emissions uptick in recent years, as the dramatic increase in renewables has not come close to offsetting the greater CO2 emissions generated from the renewed German emphasis on coal.
Adding More Wind And Solar Power Ultimately Raises CO2 Emissions, As More Fossil Fuel Backup Capacity Must Be Built
What’s happening in Germany is, unfortunately, a bellwether for what is to come in other large wealthy countries attempting to make renewables the kingpin of their power grids.  The unspoken truth about renewables was succinctly summarized in a 2012 Los Angeles Times analysis :
“As more solar and wind generators come online, … the demand will rise for more backup power from fossil fuel plants.”
The full article, entitled “Rise in renewable energy will require more use of fossil fuels”  also points out that wind turbines often produce a tiny fraction (1 percent?) of their claimed potential, meaning the gap must be filled by fossil fuels:

Wind provided just 33 megawatts of power statewide in the midafternoon, less than 1% of the potential from wind farms capable of producing 4,000 megawatts of electricity.
As is true on many days in California when multibillion-dollar investments in wind and solar energy plants are thwarted by the weather, the void was filled by gas-fired plants like the Delta Energy Center.
One of the hidden costs of solar and wind power — and a problem the state is not yet prepared to meet — is that wind and solar energy must be backed up by other sources, typically gas-fired generators. As more solar and wind energy generators come online, fulfilling a legal mandate to produce one-third of California’s electricity by 2020, the demand will rise for more backup power from fossil fuel plants.

Another observational analysis suggests that much of the power generation thought to be attributed to wind actually came from backup sources, or fossil fuels:

“More than half the electric generation nominally credited to wind power is actually produced by fossil fuels, mostly natural gas.”

Analysis from a recently published resource management paper suggests that overall CO2 emissions will actually double in the next 16 years (by 2032) in Canada (Ontario) as more wind and solar capacity is added.  Wind and solar require reliable backup when the Sun isn’t shining and/or the wind isn’t blowing…and fossil fuel energies (natural gas, coal) are the reliable backup(s) of choice.

Why Will Emissions Double as We Add Wind and Solar Plants?  [pg. 15]
Wind and Solar require flexible backup generation.  Nuclear is too inflexible to backup renewables without expensive engineering changes to the reactors.  Flexible electric storage is too expensive at the moment. Consequently natural gas provides the backup for wind and solar in North America. When you add wind and solar you are actually forced to reduce nuclear generation to make room for more natural gas generation to provide flexible backup.
Ontario currently produces electricity at less than 40 grams of CO2 emissions/kWh. Wind and solar with natural gas backup produces electricity at about 200 grams of CO2 emissions/kWh. Therefore adding wind and solar to Ontario’s grid drives CO2 emissions higher.
From 2016 to 2032 as Ontario phases out nuclear capacity to make room for wind and solar, CO2 emissions will double (2013 LTEP data).  In Ontario, with limited economic hydro and expensive storage, it is mathematically impossible to achieve low CO2 emissions at reasonable electricity prices without nuclear generation.

Scientists Increasingly Conclude Global-Scale Renewables-Driven Power Supply Will Never Happen
Scientists have increasingly weighed in on the vacuousness of the current emphasis on renewable energy generation.  For example…

Solar power is a “non-sustainable energy sink” and “will not help in any way to replace the fossil fuel” even though “many people believe renewable energy sources to be capable of substituting fossil or nuclear energy.”
Ferroni and Hopkirk, 2016

Abstract: Many people believe renewable energy sources to be capable of substituting fossil or nuclear energy. However there exist very few scientifically sound studies, which apply due diligence to substantiating this impression. … The main reasons are due to the fact that on one hand, solar electricity is very material-intensive, labour-intensive and capital-intensive and on the other hand the solar radiation exhibits a rather low power density.
Conclusion: [A]n electrical supply system based on today’s PV [photovoltaic] technologies cannot be termed an energy source, but rather a non-sustainable energy sink … [I]t has become clear that photovoltaic energy at least will not help in any way to replace the fossil fuel.

For wind and solar, the “energy return on energy invested falls, and environmental costs rise” as more wind and solar power capacity is added.
Moriarty and Honnery, 2016

Highlights: We argue it is unlikely that RE [renewable energy] can meet existing global energy use.
The most important RE [renewable energy] sources, wind and solar energy, are also intermittent, necessitating major energy storage as these sources increase their share of total energy supply. We show that estimates for the technical potential of RE [renewable energy] vary by two orders of magnitude, and argue that values at the lower end of the range must be seriously considered, both because their energy return on energy invested falls, and environmental costs rise, with cumulative output.

The “numbers just don’t add up” to curtail world temperatures with wind and solar, and thus our current efforts “will almost surely fail.”
Jones and Warner, 2016

Efforts to curtail world temps will almost surely fail
The Texas A&M researchers modelled the projected growth in global population and per capita energy consumption, as well as the size of known reserves of oil, coal and natural gas, and greenhouse gas emissions to determine just how difficult it will be to achieve the less-than-2 degree Celsius warming goal.  “It would require rates of change in our energy infrastructure and energy mix that have never happened in world history and that are extremely unlikely to be achieved,” explains Jones.   “Just considering wind power, we found that it would take an annual installation of 485,000 5-megawatt wind turbines by 2028. The equivalent of about 13,000 were installed in 2015. That’s a 37-fold increase in the annual installation rate in only 13 years to achieve just the wind power goal,” adds Jones.  Similar expansion rates are needed for other renewable energy sources.  “To even come close to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement, 50 percent of our energy will need to come from renewable sources by 2028, and today it is only 9 percent, including hydropower. For a world that wants to fight climate change, the numbers just don’t add up to do it.”

Considering the inevitable increases in CO2 emissions (due to the need for fossil fuel backup),  the potential health hazards and exponentially-growing financial burden shouldered by the world’s (mostly poor) citizens, the impossibility of supplanting fossil fuels in power generation…associated with an intentioned global-scale increase in renewable energy in the coming decades, one needs to ask: Are renewables like wind and solar even worth it?

Share this...FacebookTwitterUSA’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) provides data here on snow cover.
Because global warming is supposed to be leading to less snow, one would think that snow cover in terms of area would be trending downwards over the past 50 or so years. However, the data tell us a very different story.
Surprisingly wintertime snow cover area has actually been trending upwards over the past 50 years and all-year snow cover in the northern hemisphere has been pretty much steady, and even of the rise over the past 25 years!.
The following NOAA chart shows us the northern hemisphere show cover for November:

Clearly the November trend is solidly upwards, with especially great area extents over 5 of the last 6 Novembers. The next chart is for December:

In December as well we see especially vast snow cover over many of the past 15 years – even higher than the winters of the 1970s, when we were being bombarded with warnings of global cooling.
Next we present the data for January, where see no change over the past 48 years:

However in January, over the past 25 years we can make out a rising trend as well. Claims that snow is becoming a thing of the past are very false.

February’s trend tell us the same story: greater snow cover:

Again here as well the powerfully upward trend is clearly visible since 1990.
The same is true for the autumn months of September and October.
The spring and summer months, however, show a downward trend, and so global warming alarmists may be quick to seize upon these data as evidence supporting their hypothesis.
But here as well when you leave out the cold 1970s and 80s and look at the trend since 1990, little is really happening during the spring and summer months.
The next chart shows the northern hemispheric snow cover for the whole year:

The whole year trend is only very slightly downward – hardly anything that looks “catastrophic” and would put us on the verge of the dramatic-sounding climate system “tipping point”.
In fact eyeballing the all-year trend from 1990, here as well we see that snow cover is tending upwards rather than downwards, hence there’s no reason for any alarm with regards to snow cover.
As far as northern hemispheric snow cover is concerned, everything remains well within the range of natural variability.

Stability might not be everything, but everything is nothing without it. Turkey’s current government has learned this lesson and delivered stability and growth. These welcome developments, coupled with large privatizations and an international investment climate that has encouraged risk taking, have produced a record surge in foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows to Turkey. This is good news, but it has to be put into perspective. Turkey hasn’t been alone: FDI has increased dramatically on a global basis over the past 3 years. For example, while FDI inflows to Turkey increased by 76.3% in 2006, those going to the U.S. during the same period increased by 78.2%. Even more sobering news comes when one digs into the details of what makes an economy competitive, an important metric in the eyes of foreign investors. It is clear that, while Turkey has great potential, its businesses and workers are burdened by a sub‐​standard legal system, a heavy bureaucracy that produces a lot of government red tape and a tax system that discourages work in the formal economy. These negative factors result in Turkey’s relatively low rankings in studies that measure competitiveness. For example, Turkey ranks 83rd (just below Moldova and Kenya) in the Heritage Foundation–Wall Street Journal 2007 Index of Economic Freedom.



Allow me to stress just how important an indicator a country’s competitiveness ranking is: In studies conducted for the Joint Economic Committee of the US Congress, I found that there is a roughly one‐​to‐​one correspondence between changes in measures for economic freedom (“competitiveness”) and economic growth. If Turkey wants to foster stable, rapid growth, it must continue on a much more accelerated path of liberal economic reform.



Estonia took that path, so let’s look at its accomplishments. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Estonia got rid of the Russian ruble and started issuing its own money (the kroon) in 1992 via a currency board, which is a monetary institution that issues kroons that are fully backed by foreign reserves and freely convertible at a fixed rate of 15.65 per euro. Estonia also enacted a wide range of free‐​market reforms, including the introduction of a simple, flat‐​rate tax system. Not surprisingly, over the last15 years Estonia has become the 12th freest economy in the world (the highest ranking for any former communist country) and its GDP per capita has increased tenfold since 1992, to a projected $12,900 per capita this year.



Turkey‐​given its people, location and history‐​has great economic potential and could make dramatic improvements in its competitiveness. The problem is that this potential isn’t realized because of its history of questionable economic policies and unstable money. As an illustration, consider that the Turkish public sector is less than one‐​half as productive as the public sector in Singapore. Also, according to the World Bank’s Doing Business 2007 report, which evaluates 175 countries, Turkey’s labor market ranks 146th in terms of the difficulties businesses face in hiring and firing workers. The burdensome laws and regulations affecting Turkey’s labor market are unfriendly to both workers and businesses. At present, it is difficult to hire new workers and costly to fire them. As a result, the labor market is rigid and unable to respond to competitive pressures and to create an adequate number of jobs. The weight of Turkey’s labor laws and regulations should be dramatically reduced to make the labor market flexible and competitive.



Punishingly high taxes on wages add to that dysfunction. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris has calculated the “tax wedge” for OECD member countries. The tax wedge is the share of employee earnings taken by the government. It is equal to the difference between labor costs to the employer and the net take‐​home pay of the employee, including any cash benefits received from government welfare programs. For a family with two children and one working parent, Turkey’s 42.8% tax wedge was larger than that of any other OECD country in 2006, and over 15 percentage points higher than the OECD average of 27.5%. Turkey’s high taxes push Turks out of the formal labor market, forcing them to work in the relatively unproductive gray economy or to seek employment abroad. Taxes on wages in Turkey should be reduced by 75%-90%. Such a reduction would shrink Turkey’s tax wedge on wages to roughly the same level as that of Ireland, the latest tiger economy.



The best way for Turkey to modernize and improve competitiveness is to unilaterally implement its own “Made in Turkey” set of liberal economic reforms. Since the time of Adam Smith, liberal economists have advocated that countries unilaterally adopt free market and free trade policies for the simple reason that those policies are correct in both principle and practice. They argued against the principle of reciprocity, which requires a country to only reduce trade barriers if other countries do so as well. In practice, the unilateral adoption of the rule of law and free market policies is popular and works well. There is no better example than the Republic of Singapore.



In 1965, Singapore gained its independence‐​actually, Singapore was expelled from a two‐​year federation with Malaysia. At that time, Singapore was very backward, poor, and had only one important asset‐​its strategic location. Singapore was a speck on the map in a dangerous part of the world, and its population was made up of a diverse range of immigrants with a history of communal tensions. However, Singapore had a strong leader with a clear vision of how to modernize his country.



Lee Kuan Yew explicitly ruled out passing the begging bowl and accepting foreign assistance of any kind. His central principle for organizing the government was to run a tight ship with no waste or corruption. To implement that principle, Lee Kuan Yew appointed only first‐​class civil servants and paid them first‐​class wages. Another principle he embraced was first‐​world competition, which he attained through light taxation, minimal regulation of business and free trade. Lastly, Lee Kuan Yew insisted on personal security, public order and the protection of private property. It’s no surprise that today Singapore is one of the richest and most competitive countries in the world.



Although stability is a necessary condition for prosperity, it comes at a price in a country with a long history of unstable money. That is why Turkey’s real interest rates are some of the highest in the world‐​indeed, they are punishingly high and unsustainable. An orthodox currency board‐​along the lines of Estonia’s-would not only credibly fix the lira’s exchange rate (to the euro or the dollar, for example) but it would also fix Turkey’s real interest rate problem. Reforms are necessary for Turkey to attain big league status. Assuming that the Justice and Development Party retains its majority, its challenge will be to appoint top‐​quality people to key positions and firmly point the way. This challenge shouldn’t be taken lightly. Indeed, if history is a guide, reform momentum erodes with time.

Friends of federalism cheered last month when the Obama administration reversed the Bush policy of prosecuting medical marijuana cases in states that have legalized the practice. Welcome though that change was, let’s hold the applause.



Not yet a year into his administration, Obama’s record on 10th Amendment issues is already clear: He’ll let the states have their way when their policies please blue team sensibilities and he’ll call in the feds when they don’t. Thus, he’ll grant California a waiver to allow it to raise auto emissions standards, but he’ll bring the hammer down when the state tries to cut payments to unionized health care workers.



That’s not how it’s supposed to work. As Madison explained in _Federalist_ 45, the powers delegated to the federal government were “few and defined,” to be exercised mainly on “external objects” like foreign policy and international trade. All else — criminal law, marriage, social policy — remained with the states or the people.





[O]ne of federalism’s core virtues is the enormous diversity it allows.



Of course, No. 45 also contains one of the _Federalist_ ’s saddest sentences, in which Madison predicts that federal tax collectors will be “principally on the seacoast, and not very numerous.” (Sometimes the Framers weren’t all that prescient.)



Indeed, the federal government’s massive power to tax and spend has increasingly allowed it to trample state prerogatives. As the $786 billion stimulus package came online this year, for the first time ever, federal aid surpassed the sales tax as the largest source of revenue for the states.



“This money isn’t manna from heaven,” warned Indiana state Sen. Jim Buck, “it comes with a price.”



California learned that lesson back in May. Struggling to close a $40 billion budget gap, the state government lowered payments to home health care workers, but the Obama team threatened to withhold billions of dollars in stimulus money unless the wage subsidies were restored.



Officials in Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s office accused the Service Employees International Union, a longtime Obama ally, of improper influence.



Just a few years back, the Republicans — nominally the party of federalism — were busily wielding federal power to enforce red state values — prosecuting medical marijuana patients, punishing doctors participating in Oregon’s “Death with Dignity” initiative, and trying to overturn Florida court decisions that allowed Terry Schiavo to be removed from life support. In that odd political climate, you often heard liberals lamenting the decline of states’ rights.



That strange new respect for the 10th Amendment lasted roughly as long as the blue team’s exile from power.



Education Secretary Arne Duncan said recently that “if we accomplish one thing in the coming years, it should be to eliminate the extreme variation in standards across America.” Diversity is bad, uniformity double‐​plus good; get with the program, comrade.



But one of federalism’s core virtues is the enormous diversity it allows. Decentralization makes it easier for Americans to escape unwelcome state experiments with fiscal and social policy.



It enhances the political power of individual citizens by allowing important decisions of governance to be settled closest to where Americans live and work. And it avoids making politics a centralized war of all against all, where each contested issue is settled in a one‐​size‐​fits‐​all fashion at the level furthest from the people.



Our federal system shouldn’t be a red team/​blue team issue, respected or flouted depending on who’s up and who’s down. Conservatives are learning to rue their abandonment of federalist principles during the last administration; liberals may come to regret their rush toward centralization during the next.

"This paper by Peter Lang, “…contains a simple analysis of the amount of greenhouse gas emissions avoided by wind power and the cost per tonne of emissions avoided. It puts these figures in context by comparing them with some other ways of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation.”
and concludes:
“1. Wind power does not avoid significant amounts of greenhouse gas emissions.
“2. Wind power is a very high cost way to avoid greenhouse gas emissions.
“3. Wind power, even with high capacity penetration, can not make a significant contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.”

"Rising global temperatures and warming ocean waters are causing one of the world’s coldest places to melt. While we know that human activity is causing climate change and driving rapid changes in Antarctica, the potential impacts that a warmer world would have on this region remain uncertain. Our new research might be able to provide some insight into what effect a warmer world would have in Antarctica, by looking at what happened more than 129,000 years ago.  We found that the mass melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet was a major cause of high sea levels during a period known as the Last Interglacial (129,000-116,000 years ago). The extreme ice loss caused more than three metres of average global sea level rise – and worryingly, it took less than 2˚C of ocean warming for it to occur. To conduct our research, we travelled to an area on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and drilled into so-called blue ice areas to reconstruct the glacial history of this ice sheet.  Blue ice areas are areas of ancient ice which have been brought to the surface by fierce, high-density winds, called katabatic winds. When these winds blow over mountains, they remove the top layer of snow and erode the exposed ice. As the ice is removed by the wind, ancient ice is brought to the surface, which offers insight into the ice sheet’s history.  While most Antarctic researchers drill deep into the ice to extract their samples, we were able to use a technique called horizontal ice core analysis. As you travel closer to the mountains of the ice sheet, the ice that been brought to the surface by these winds progressively gets older. We then were able to take surface samples on a straight, horizontal line across the blue ice area to reconstruct what happened to the ice sheet in the past.  Our team took many measurements. We first looked at the fine layers of volcanic ash in the ice to pinpoint when the mass melting took place. Alarmingly, the results showed that most ice loss happened at the start of Last Interglacial warming, some 129,000 years ago – showing how sensitive the Antarctic is to higher temperatures. We think it’s likely this melting started well before the ocean warmed by 2˚C. This is concerning to us today, as ocean temperatures continue to increase, and the West Antarctic is already melting. We also measured temperature-sensitive water molecules across the blue ice area. These isotopes revealed a large shift in temperatures, highlighting a major gap in our record at the start of the Last Interglacial. This indicates a period of sustained ice loss over thousands of years.  This period of missing ice coincides with extreme sea level rise, suggesting rapid ice melt from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. DNA testing of ancient microbes preserved in the ice revealed an abundance of methane-consuming bacteria. Their presence suggests that the release of methane gases from sediments under the ice sheet may have also played a role in accelerating the warming process. The West Antarctic ice sheet can tell us a lot about the effect of warming ocean temperatures because it rests on the seabed. It’s surrounded by large areas of floating ice, called ice shelves, that protect the central part of the sheet. As warmer ocean water travels into cavities beneath the ice shelves, ice melts from below, thinning the shelves and making the central sheet highly vulnerable to warming ocean temperatures. This process is currently being researched on the West Antarctic Thwaites Glacier, nicknamed the “Doomsday Glacier”.

      Why remote Antarctica is so important in a warming world


 Using data from our fieldwork, we ran model simulations to investigate how warming might affect the floating ice shelves. These ice shelves protect the ice sheets and help slow the flow of ice off the continent. Our results suggest a 3.8 metre sea level rise during the first thousand years of a 2˚C warmer ocean. Most of the modelled sea level rise occurred after the loss of the ice shelves, which collapsed within the first two hundred years of higher temperatures.  These findings are worrying – especially if persistent high sea surface temperatures could prompt the larger East Antarctic Ice Sheet to melt, driving global sea levels even higher. But our findings suggest the West Antarctic Ice Sheet may be close to a tipping point. Only a small temperature increase could trigger abrupt ice sheet melt and a multi-metre rise in global sea levels.  At the moment, research suggests that global sea levels could rise between 45-82cm over the next century. However, it’s thought that Antarctica will only contribute around 5cm of this – most of this sea level rise will be caused by warmer ocean waters and the melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet. But based on our findings, Antarctica’s contribution could be much greater than anticipated.  Despite 197 countries committing under the Paris agreement to restricting global warming to 2˚C by the end of this century, our findings show that even minor increases in temperature could have far-reaching impacts.

"Supply-Demand Characteristics, Storage and Capital Costs
By Peter Lang
This paper provides a simple analysis of the capital cost of solar power and energy storage sufficient to meet the demand of Australia’s National Electricity Market. It also considers some of the environmental effects. It puts the figures in perspective…
Conclusions: solar power is uneconomic. Government mandates and subsidies hide the true cost of renewable energy but these additional costs must be carried by others.

"The Chairman of the Carbon Sense Coalition, Mr Viv Forbes, today called for a grass roots revolt by the real workers of Australia against the green militia and their socialite supporters who are leading the country into job cuts, power blackouts and poverty.
Mr Forbes claimed that only three brave and outspoken politicians understand the real threats facing Australia, both from natural climate change (probably cold and dry) and from the stupid policies supposed to stop global warming (it has stopped).
Martin Ferguson is in touch with real people who keep the wheels turning in the mines, factories and transport fleet. He knows that none of these industries could operate without using carbon fuels which all produce harmless carbon dioxide gas. He knows we need efficient reliable power stations, not wind and solar playthings.
Barnaby Joyce represents the farmers, foresters and fishermen who produce the food, fibre and building materials we all need. He also knows that none of these essential items can be produced without producing more harmless CO2 gas.
Steve Fielding stands up for all the Australian families hoping for jobs for themselves and their kids. He knows that every job in Australia depends on our basic industries making the minerals, food, fibres and processed goods the world buys from us.
Public opinion polls show that ordinary Australians are increasingly swinging behind these leaders while Mr Rudd trips the Climate Change Stage, and Malcolm Turnbull agonises over how to make a more comfortable green noose for Australia. The only people who support such nonsense are the huge Climate Change Industry and those trying to buy green votes in the leafy suburbs.
All real work produces carbon dioxide.
The only way we can quickly reduce production of CO2 is by reducing jobs or reducing our consumption of food, fibre and minerals – the Ration-n-Tax Scheme thus offers unemployment and poverty in real industry in return for more taxes to create make-believe green jobs.
Mr Turnbull thinks nine amendments will make the RAT scheme acceptable. Only three amendments are required:  “Reject, reject, reject”.

There is no statistically significant warming trend since November of 1996 in monthly surface temperature records compiled at the University of East Anglia. Do we now understand why there’s been no change in fourteen and a half years?



If you read the news stories surrounding a recent paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences by Boston University’s Robert Kaufmann and three colleagues, you’d say yes, indeed. It’s China’s fault. By dramatically increasing their combustion of coal, they have increased the concentration of fine particles in the atmosphere called sulphate aerosols, which reflect away solar radiation, countering the warming that should be occurring from increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide.



Further, if this is true, then (as is usual in climate‐​world), “it’s worse than we thought.” After all, China will eventually reduce their sulfate emissions as their population becomes affluent enough to demand something better than miasmic air. Indeed, they are already beginning to clean things up, and when they finally do, all the cooling particles will be gone and the earth will warm substantially.



Reality may be a bit simpler, or much more complicated. But the reason this is all so important is that if there is no good explanation for the lack of warming, then an increasingly viable alternative is that we have overestimated the gross sensitivity of temperature to carbon dioxide in our computer models.



One problem is that we really don’t know how much cooling is exerted by sulfates, or whether they are just a convenient explanation for the failure of the forecasts of dramatic warming. The United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which grants itself climate authority, states that our “Level of Scientific Understanding” of the effects range between “low” and “very low,” with a possible cooling between zero (none) and a whopping 3.5 degrees (C) when the climate comes to equilibrium (which it will never do). That’s a plenty large range from which to pick out a number to cancel about as much warming as you’d like.



Kaufmann’s team looked into how sulfate uncertainty impacted its results and decided that it was relatively minor. However, we can’t find any independent test showing that the geographic “fingerprint” of a dramatic recent increase in sulfate cooling is actually being observed. More on this in a minute.



The other problem — and climate flatliners hate me for pointing this out — is that the beginning of the period of “no warming” includes the warmest year in the instrumental record, caused by the great El Niño of 1997–1998. In a modestly warming world, starting off at or near an anomalously high point pretty much assures little or no warming for years afterward.



Kaufmann’s team (and others) have duly noted that El Niño cycles are one factor partially responsible for the lack of recent warming. There’s little doubt of this. Further, if you back out solar changes and volcanism, as they did, you can convince yourself that there is still an underlying “residual” warming trend, but it is masked by all these variables. This has been done repeatedly in the scientific literature, which, until now, did not include increasing the sulfate effect on recent temperatures.



Where is the test of the hypothesis that sulfates are indeed responsible for the lack of warming? In this paper, it’s simply “modeled‐​in” as it fits the data well. That’s correlation, not causation.



There is very little exchange of air between the northern and southern hemispheres, and basic climate science shows that most sulfates from China will rain out before they get across the thermal equator. In fact, there is a great deal of literature out there published by luminaries like the Department of Energy’s Ben Santer and NASA’s James Hansen claiming relative cooling of the northern hemisphere from sulfates, compared to the southern.



So, if it is indeed sulfates cooling the warming, given that there is no net change in global temperature, then the northern hemisphere should be cooling since 1998 (the first year in Kaufmann’s paper) while the southern warms. Here are the sad facts:





The opposite is occurring. Why this test was not performed eludes me. Perhaps that is because it provides yet another piece of evidence supporting the hypothesis that we have simply overstated the sensitivity of surface temperature to changes in carbon dioxide.

What Models Say:

♦  IPCC TAR (2001):  “Milder winter temperatures will decrease heavy snowstorms“
♦   Kunkel et al., 2002:  “Surface conditions favorable for heavy lake-effect snow decreased in frequency by 50% and 90% for the HadCM2 and CGCM1 [models], respectively, by the late 21st Century. This reduction was due almost entirely to … an increase in average winter air temperatures.”
♦   IPCC AR4 (2007):  “Snow season length and snow depth are very likely to decrease in most of North America“
♦   Kapnick and Delworth, 2013:  “In response to idealized radiative forcing changes, both models produce similar global-scale responses in which global-mean temperature and total precipitation increase while snowfall decreases. … By using a simple multivariate model, temperature is shown to drive these trends by decreasing snowfall almost everywhere” (press release)  “In North America, the greatest reductions in snowfall will occur along the northeast coast, in the mountainous west, and in the Pacific Northwest. Coastal regions from Virginia to Maine … will get less than half the amount of snow currently received.”

What Observations Say:

Coleman and Schwartz, 2017
“Data revealed 713 blizzards over the 55 years, with a mean of 13 events per season. Seasonal blizzard frequency ranged from one blizzard in 1980/81 to 32 blizzards in 2007/08. Federal disaster declarations resulting from blizzards totaled 57, with more than one-half of them occurring in the twenty-first century.”
“Storm Data attributed 711 fatalities during the 55-yr study period, with an average of one individual per event; 2044 injuries were reported, with a mean of nearly three per blizzard. Property damage totaled approximately $9.11 billion in unadjusted dollars, with an approximate mean of $12.6 million per storm.”
“Seasonal blizzard frequencies displayed a distinct upward trend, with a more substantial rise over the past two decades. … The modeled increase in blizzard activity showed a nearly fourfold upsurge between the start and end of the study period at 5.9 and 21.6 blizzards, respectively. On the basis of current model trends, the expected blizzard total for a season is 32 blizzards by 2050; uncertainty exists on whether the linear trend will continue or stabilize in the near future.”

The Historical Context: More Snow Means Temperatures Are Cooling, Not Warming

It has long been assumed in the scientific community that snow coverage would decrease during warm periods, and increase during cool periods.  For example:

Eichenlaub, 1970
“Evidence suggests that lake effect snowfall has significantly increased during the past several decades, particularly in Southern Michigan and Northern Indiana. While the observed changes cannot be definitively ascribed to any single factor, it seems likely that a general cooling of winter temperatures may be partially responsible for this climatic change.”
[M]any of the snowfall time-series curves for the lake stations show downward trends during the 1920’s and 1930’s, at the height of the recent warm period, and the more recent snowfall increase has coincided with a general world-wide cooling which has occurred in the last several decades.
Recent evidence derived from [isotope] analysis of ice core samples on the Greenland ice cap indicates a continuance of this cooling trend for another 20 or 30 years.”

What Dr. Eichenlaub was describing with regard to the increasing and decreasing temperature and snowfall trends is explained by Dr. Agee (1980).  The Northern Hemisphere’s surface temperatures warmed by “nearly 1°C” between 1890 and 1940, and then after 1940 and through the mid-1970s, the Northern Hemisphere experienced “comparable cooling” (almost -1°C).  (Most of these observations of warming and cooling amplitudes have now been removed from modern Northern Hemisphere datasets via “adjustments” so as to comply with climate model projections.)

Agee, 1980



In the temperature records for Indiana and Iowa (U.S.), Agee (1980) reported that, following the overall hemispheric pattern, both states warmed sharply during the 1920s to 1940s and then cooled by more than 2°C in the decades after.   This was the context that Eichenlaub (1970) was referring to in pointing out that the U.S. had been experiencing a long-term cooling trend since the 1940s which led to a significant increase in snowfall.

The U.S. Cooling Trend Has Returned In Recent Decades

According to NOAA, winter temperatures for the contiguous U.S. declined at a rate of -1.13°F per decade between 1995 and 2014.

Large Regions Of The U.S. Are Still Colder Now Than They Were In The 1950s

North American Continent Is Not Discernibly Warmer Than During The Little Ice Age

Gennaretti et al., 2014


Pitman and Smith, 2012 


Steinman et al., 2016


Fortin and Gajewski, 2016
“Biological production decreased again at ~ 2 ka and the rate of cooling increased in the past 2 ka, with coolest temperatures occurring between 0.46 and 0.36 ka [460 and 360 years ago], coinciding with the Little Ice Age. Although biological production increased in the last 150 yr, the reconstructed temperatures do not indicate a warming during this time. … Modern inferred temperatures based on both pollen and chironomids are [currently] up to 3°C cooler than those inferred for the mid-Holocene.”


Summary

It is widely accepted that enhanced snow cover and more frequent snow storms (blizzards) occur when winter temperatures are cooling (or cooler relative to an identified warm period).   U.S. temperatures cooled dramatically after the 1940s and 1950s, and they may only have recently reached the levels of warmth achieved in the first half of the 20th century, when snow cover was significantly reduced.   Blizzard frequency has increased almost four-fold since 1960, even as climate models have claimed they should be declining in frequency.   This increase in snow storms has coincided with a 20-year (1995-2014) winter temperature cooling trend in the U.S.
Overall, there has been no discernible anthropogenic influence on U.S. snow storm frequency in the last several decades, and there has been no discernible anthropogenic influence on U.S. temperatures in the last several hundred years, or even the last several decades relative to the early 20th century.

"Justin Peck stops short of calling it a protest dance, but his newest ballet, “The Times Are Racing,” is certainly of the moment. The dancers wear sneakers, and   and hoodies emblazoned with words like Unite, React, Act, Protest and Fight. (The costumes are by Humberto Leon for Opening Ceremony.) The electronic music is Dan Deacon’s     suite from “America,” a 2012 album written out of his frustration with the state of the country and the world. Mr. Peck, 29, started choreographing the dance before the presidential election, but after Donald J. Trump won, he said, the ballet changed course. A few days before its Thursday premiere at New York City Ballet, Mr. Peck, the company’s resident choreographer and a soloist  —   this time he even included a part for himself  —   spoke about the work, his love of tap and how his teenage obsession with the video game Dance Dance Revolution had not been in vain. Here are edited excerpts from that conversation. How did the political landscape shape this ballet?  We were working on this throughout the election. The day after the election was such an emotional and sobering moment. It felt like a turning point for the piece. Did the choreography change or become more focused after the election?  It changed. It’s a less optimistic piece than it could have been. But it’s also going back to the music. It’s such a cathartic piece, and I think the choreography and the arc of the whole ballet has that feeling of exhaustion and running in a way that doesn’t need to be spelled out too much. I feel people are going to be able to interpret it in whatever way they want to. How did the sneakers come in?  When I’m in sneakers, it changes my body carriage. I feel more in my own skin. I also think there’s less emphasis placed on line and accuracy and more freedom to dance with more energy and fullness and risk. I’ve done one piece with sneakers for L. A. Dance Project, and I really enjoyed working in that way and I wanted to explore it more at New York City Ballet. We have “[N. Y. Export:] Opus Jazz” and “West Side Story Suite,” and I’ve danced both. In this piece, you’re mixing tap with ballet and a little  ? It’s hard to describe. I would say you could even separate the tap influences: Rhythm tap and hoofing meets Fred Astaire   and Gene Kelly classical   movements meets ballet, which is definitely the backbone of the piece. And that meets   meets party dancing. But it’s mixed in the same way that Dan’s music is synthesized together. The ballet features a   number for you and Robert Fairchild. Savion Glover is one of your heroes, right? He is! The reason I started dancing in the first place was my dad took me to see “Bring In ’da Noise, Bring In ’da Funk” when I was 9. I was so enamored with his style and his athleticism and the intricacy of his tap choreography that I started training. Is the tap the reason you cast yourself in the dance? That was a big factor. I always really loved tap as an art form, and in this piece of music there was one section that is highly percussive and intricate. I felt the only way to express that through movement was using   techniques, and for me it was less about the sounds we were making and more about the physicality of the movement. It’s not on a lot of ballet dancers’ résumés to be able to tap in that way, and I knew Robbie had that ability as well. The duet also takes partial inspiration from when Robbie and I were roommates at the School of American Ballet. What happened? We were 17, and we got really into Dance Dance Revolution, the video game. We actually got a system for our dorms, and we started to play it obsessively, and we got really good and really in sync with our movement. We would play until superlate at night and then wake up the next morning with shin splints and not be able to go to class. [Laughs] I am loving this story.  I wanted it to almost be like we were both following along on the same Dance Dance Revolution video game level track. [In the game, standing players hit arrows with their feet in keeping with musical and visual cues.] That’s why the movement is completely identical. I love it when you go to an arcade and you see two people who are really good at that game and they’re moving completely together. I wanted to use it as the inspiration for this duet, too. Are there characters, loosely, in this ballet? Robbie is a standout protagonist figure. For Robbie’s role, his alternate is Ashly Isaacs. I don’t know if it’s a first time, but it certainly feels like it might be one of the first that there’s been a   principal role at New York City Ballet. She’s stepped in a few times, and she looks great. She’ll get to perform the ballet in the spring. Did you choose her for her tapping ability?  Yeah, that definitely needs to be checked off, but also she seems very suited to the role and it’s the exact same choreography  —   there’s no compromise in what she does when she performs it and I thought that was really cool. It’s amazing. Do you think Savion will see the ballet? Do you know him?  No. [Laughs] I think I met him once, but I don’t know if he knows who I am. I saw him perform last weekend at the Blue Note. He’s so good. He will just go for 45 minutes. This dance that Robbie and I do is, like, two minutes long, and we’re exhausted."
"Business, industry, farming and environmental leaders have joined forces to warn Australia is “woefully unprepared” for the impact of climate change over the coming decades and to urge the Morrison government to do far more to cut emissions and improve the country’s resilience. An extraordinary statement by 10 organisations, several with close ties to the Coalition, said climate change was already having a “real and significant” impact on the economy and community. The groups, representing the breadth of Australian society, called on the federal and state governments to act immediately to reduce and manage the risks. Organisations including the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Industry Group, the National Farmers’ Federation, the Australian Aluminium Council and the ACTU said public debate about the cost of doing more to reduce emissions had too often not considered the cost of climate change to the economy, environment and society. They cited evidence from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that emissions would need to be net-zero by 2050 if the goals of the Paris agreement are to be achieved, and said Australia must adopt that target. The statement, issued under the Australian Climate Roundtable banner, said Australia’s future prosperity would be at risk unless it had a coherent national response to the crisis. “The scale of costs and breadth of the impact of climate change for people in Australia is deeply concerning and will escalate over time,” it said. “It is in Australia’s national interest that we do all we can to contribute to successful global action to minimise further temperature rises and take action to manage the changes we can’t avoid.” The groups, some of which have been involved in past campaigns to slow action on climate change, agreed to the statement after holding five climate-themed expert workshops. They heard from climate scientists and organisations including the Reserve Bank, the Australian Energy Market Operator and Insurance Australia Group. The statement said the expert advice made clear temperatures were increasing, extreme climate-related events such as heatwaves and bushfires were becoming more intense and frequent, and natural systems were suffering irreversible damage. Some communities were now in a constant state of recovery from successive natural disasters with growing economic ramifications. It said inaction would lead to unprecedented economic damage to Australia and its regional trading partners, heightened risks to financial stability – particularly as the insurance industry became compromised – and significant threats to the agriculture, forestry, tourism and fishing industries. There would be severe pressure on government budgets due to a dramatic fall in tax revenue and a rise in natural disasters that demanded emergency response and recovery spending and there would be major and long-lived social and health impacts, including loss of life. The roundtable concluded Australia must play its fair part in international efforts to limit average global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, or at most to well below a 2C increase. That meant setting a target of net-zero emissions by mid-century and introducing policies to meet it that aimed to lift social equity and the country’s global competitive advantage in a zero-emissions world. The Morrison government has rejected calls that it back the goal of net-zero emissions by 2050. The target has been adopted by more than 70 countries, all Australian states and a growing number of business and investors, including fossil fuel companies. National emissions have dipped 1.5% since the Coalition was elected in 2013 after falling about 14% in six years under Labor. The roundtable said even with ambitious global action Australia faced escalating costs due to unavoidable climate change from historical emissions, and must act swiftly to improve resilience. It said the country was “woefully unprepared” for the scale of threats that would emerge as it lacked a systemic government response at any level. The groups recommended climate change response become a standing item at national cabinet meetings and that the government order a biannual climate vulnerability assessment similar to that undertaken in the US and New Zealand. They said the climate crisis needed to be addressed as the country tackled the Covid-19 economic recovery. Other members of the roundtable are the Australian Conservation Foundation, the Australian Council of Social Service, the Australian Energy Council, the Investor Group on Climate Change and the World Wide Fund for Nature. Innes Willox, the chief executive of the Australian Industry Group, said the evidence was deeply concerning. “The urgency of (the risk of huge costs) should drive all Australian governments to lift our game on adaptation and put net zero emissions by 2050 at the heart of their plans for prosperity,” he said. The business council chief, Jennifer Westacott, said: “Putting Australia on the path to net zero emissions by 2050 can be an opportunity to drive billions of dollars of new investment, create new jobs, create new industries, boost our resilience and build the stronger regions we’ll need to supercharge our recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic.” The roundtable said it planned a second series of workshops on what a successful transition to net-zero emissions would look like. It said the country risked losing investment to countries with clearer targets and transition roadmaps if it did not act. “We are prepared to work with all stakeholders to help Australia rise above decades of delay and come together to address one of the greatest challenges the nation has ever faced,” it said. A spokesperson for the emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, said the government was committed to the Paris agreement and its policies, including a technology investment roadmap and recommendations by businessman Grant King, would help it beat its 2030 climate goal of a 26-28% cut below 2005 levels.  Scientists and analysts have found Australia would need to cut its emissions by at least 45% by 2030 to play its part under the Paris pact. Labor’s climate spokesman, Mark Butler, said: “If Scott Morrison or the ‘moderate Liberals’ have any backbone they will listen to this statement and commit to net zero emissions by 2050.” The Insurance Council of Australia said on Thursday the industry had received more than 297,780 claims relating to bushfire, flood and hailstorm catastrophes last summer, with losses totalling almost $5.4bn. The chief executive, Rob Whelan, said it was the worst natural disaster season he had experienced in 10.5 years in the role."
"Earth’s forests oxygenate the atmosphere and store vast quantities of planet-warming carbon dioxide (CO₂). But research suggests that the health of these vast ecosystems in large part depends on the work of indigenous people.    Indigenous territories and protected areas cover 52% of the Amazon forest and store 58% of its carbon. A recent study found that these areas had the lowest net loss of carbon between 2003 and 2016, with 90% of net emissions coming from outside these protected lands. “Where indigenous people live, [in Central America] you will find the best preserved natural resources,” declared the International Union for Conservation of Nature in 2018. A study published that year found that “indigenous people are crucial for the conservation of a quarter of the land of the Earth”.

 In the forest territories that indigenous people maintain deforestation is lower, more carbon is stored and less emitted, biodiversity is better conserved, and resources are more sustainably and fairly managed. But indigenous territories and the biodiversity and carbon they protect are under siege. For indigenous people to continue in this invaluable role, they need secure land tenure and strong local governance systems. Nowhere is this currently more apparent than in Bolivia. On indigenous territories in Bolivia that have secured property rights, deforestation rates are 2.8 times lower than outside of them. Such lands cover 20% of the country’s territory, so the contribution of indigenous peoples in Bolivia to fighting climate change is substantial. But this situation has been undermined by Bolivia’s development policies, and could be threatened further with the recent shift to a right-wing government. In the last two decades, Bolivia has led the world in championing indigenous rights. Upon taking power in 2006, Evo Morales helped write a new national constitution. It paved the way to redistribute land to indigenous peoples and support their claims for self-government.  Morales also put indigenous peoples at the forefront of climate change discussions, when in 2010, he organised the People’s Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth. The People’s Agreement that emerged highlighted the important role that indigenous peoples play safeguarding the planet. But during his second term in power, the government’s commitment to indigenous rights and to the fight against climate change faltered. In 2010, Morales approved the construction of a road through an indigenous territory and protected area, which was bitterly resisted by the Mojeño people, alongside other indigenous peoples of the lowlands and highlands. Morales announced his intention in 2013 to expand farming lands from three to 13 million hectares over ten years – allowing agriculture businesses to encroach on indigenous homelands. Morales then increased the area of land that small producers are allowed to deforest from five to 20 hectares, and made the conditions more flexible for this process to continue. Support for biofuel production from soya plantations and cattle grazing for beef export encouraged the opening up of new lands, with people using fire to clear forests for farming.

      Defending the environment now more lethal than soldiering in some war zones – and indigenous peoples are suffering most


 Between August and September 2019, Bolivia was wracked by the worst forest fires of the last two decades. A total of 3.6 million hectares were burned, and two reports showed that 57% of these fires were set in state-owned lands (which are largely composed of protected areas) and indigenous titled territories.  The push to expand agriculture has continued with Bolivia’s new government. Shortly after Morales resigned on November 10 2019, the legislative assembly of Beni – a lowland region – approved a law which would open 42% of the land to farming and industrial activities. On December 16 2019, Beni’s Indigenous declared a state of emergency. By granting autonomy rights to indigenous people, the state would effectively recognise their right to govern themselves in matters related to the land and natural resources. Without this, people have no real control of their territories, and there is little that indigenous people can do to control environmental degradation. Out of 33 claims for territorial self-government that were raised between 2009 and 2019, only three have been approved by the Bolivian government. Our research suggests that the main reason so few have succeeded is the new laws enacted during the Morales era, which make autonomy claims a complex and cumbersome process. We’ve been working with the Monkoxi Indigenous Nation from the Bolivian lowlands since 2013, to help advance their claim to political autonomy in their territory. The Monkoxi belong to one of the 30 groups that are still waiting for their rights to be recognised, having initiated the legal claim in 2009. Bolivia is now in the hands of an interim conservative leader, Jeanine Añez, who has been accused by indigenous rights organisations of holding strong anti-indigenous convictions. Since expansion of the farming frontier was agreed between the right and Morales while he was in power, it’s doubtful the former will change this arrangement if they remain in power after general elections in May 2020. The pending autonomy claims that would allow indigenous people to consolidate their territorial control are also likely to stagnate. The recent history of Bolivia shows the danger of allowing the fight for indigenous rights and climate action to be co-opted. To ensure that indigenous rights and climate change remain high in the next goverment’s agenda, indigenous peoples must work hard to reunite and recover the independence that they once had from mainstream politics.

Summary: Here are three stories about environmental destruction, all featuring “five trillion” as the horrific number. Scary stories. Are they accurate?
To understand a trillion, look at it in cash (an example of giving context)

(1) Five trillion tons of ice has melted!
“5 Trillion Tons of Ice Lost Since 2002” by climate propagandist Phil Plait at Slate.
“…land ice loss is perhaps most important as a political trigger; the sheer amount of land ice being lost every year is immediate, here, now. And the numbers are staggering … From 2002 to mid-November 2014 — less than 13 years — the combined land ice loss from Antarctica and Greenland is more than 5 trillion tons. Five. Trillion. Tons. That’s beyond staggering; that’s almost incomprehensible. It’s a volume of about 5,700 cubic kilometers, a cube of ice nearly 18 kilometers — more than 11 miles — on a side.”
This is vintage propaganda, giving big numbers with no context. Much as the Right does with the Federal deficit (which if converted into pennies could build a bridge to Mars!).
The total mass of Earth’s ice is roughly 33 thousand trillion metric tons (per table 2 of 2013 USGS; other estimates differ). Five trillion metric tons over 13 years is 0.112% per year.  At that rate the Earth’s ice will melt in 6,600 86,000 years. What level of technology will we have in a thousand years? Children in the year 3,000 will probably consider conflate burning oil and cow dung, both things done by primitive people in the dark ages.
Also, estimates of Antarctica’s ice loss differ widely. A December 2015 NASA study found that Antarctica gained ice mass from 1992-2008 (see the press release).

(2) Five trillion pieces of plastic choke the oceans
“The Ocean Contains Over Five Trillion Pieces of Plastic Weighing More than 250,000 Tons” by Rachel Nuwer at the Smithsonian — “These frightening figures represent the most robust estimate of marine plastic pollution calculated to date.” Based on a paper by Marcus Eriksen et al in PLOS One, 10 December 2014. Lots of scary articles misrepresenting this useful study.
Again, five trillion — this time it is pieces of plastic. Of course 92% of those are smaller than 4.75mm (0.18″); only 0.17% are larger than 8″. The 250 thousand tons is spread among 1.4 billion tons of water on Earth.
Are we “choking the ocean with plastic”? No. See the origin of this myth. It’s a problem, but a minor one compared to the things we’re doing to wreck the oceans.

(3) We will burn five trillion tons of carbon and scorch the world
“The climate response to five trillion tonnes of carbon” by Katarzyna B. Tokarska et al, Nature Climate Change, in press. This produced the usual hysteria. It would “scorch” the Earth. It paints the “Bleakest Picture of Our Future to Date“.
“Burning all known reserves of oil, gas and coal would inject about five trillion tonnes of heat-trapping carbon into the atmosphere … This number — about ten times the 540 billion tonnes of carbon emitted since the start of industrialisation — would be reached near the end of the 22nd century if fossil fuel trends go unchanged, it added. Most of the UN climate science panel’s projections for greenhouse gas emissions do not forecast beyond two trillion tonnes of carbon …” {From Phys.org.}
This study is based on RCP8.5 (worst of the four scenarios in the IPCC’s AR5), like almost all climate nightmare forecasts. It extrapolates the RCP8.5 scenario through 2300. Like most climate nightmare forecasts, it describes RCP8.5 as a “business as usual scenario… in the absence of any climate change mitigation policy”.
This misrepresents the papers creating RCPC8.5 and its use in the IPCC’s AR5. It does not mention RCP8.5’s unlikely assumption that technological progress stagnates (through 2300!). Nor does it mention the likely population crash starting in the late 21st century as the current decline in fertility eventually has effect. See this for more information about RCP8.5.
Conclusions
We are ignorant because we read the news, which overflows with propaganda. Journalists pay for their love of politically appropriate narratives with the loss of their profession’s credibility — contributing to their industry’s loss of revenue — and layoffs (US newsroom jobs down 40% since 2006-2014).
The exaggerated reporting of environmental problems — many of which range from serious to existential — has similarly eroded away the public’s concern about these risks (Gallup’s poll ranking most important concerns, and concerns about specific environmental risks). We pay a high price for the journalists’ lust for clicks.
Also note that scientists are in effect complicit in these misreported stories by their silence.

"**A few months ago a Chinese official asked me if I thought foreign powers were fomenting Hong Kong's social unrest.**
""To get so many people to come to the streets,"" he mused, ""must take organisation, a big sum of money and political resources.""
Since then, the protests sparked at the beginning of Hong Kong's hot summer have raged on through autumn and into winter.
The massive marches have continued, interspersed with increasingly violent pitched battles between smaller groups of more militant protesters and the police.
The toll is measured in a stark ledger of police figures that, even a short while ago, would have seemed impossible for one of the world's leading financial capitals and a bastion of social stability.
More than 6,000 arrests, 16,000 tear-gas rounds, 10,000 rubber bullets.
As the sense of political crisis has deepened and divisions have hardened, China has continued to see the sinister hand of foreign meddling behind every twist and turn.
In January, China's supreme political leader Xi Jinping convened a high-level Communist Party meeting focused on ""major risk prevention"".
He told the assembled senior officials to be on their guard for ""black swans"" - the unpredictable, unseen events that can plunge a system into crisis. But he also warned them about what he called ""grey rhinoceroses"" - the known risks that are ignored until it's too late.
While state media reports show the discussions ranging over issues from housing bubbles to food safety, there's no mention at all of Hong Kong.
And yet the seeds were already being sown for what has become the biggest challenge to Communist Party rule in a generation.
A few weeks after the meeting, the Hong Kong government, with the strong backing of Beijing, introduced a bill that would allow the extradition of suspects to mainland China.
Opposition to the bill was immediate, deep-seated and widespread, driven by the fear that it would allow China's legal system to reach deep inside Hong Kong.
Despite assurances that ""political crimes"" would not be covered, many saw it as a fundamental breach of the ""one country, two systems"" principle under which the territory is supposed to be governed.
It wasn't just human rights groups and legal experts expressing alarm, but the business community, multinational corporations and foreign governments too, worried that overseas nationals might also find themselves targeted by such a law.
And so, the first claims of ""foreign meddling"" began to be heard.
On 9 June, a massive and overwhelmingly peaceful rally against the bill was held, with organisers putting the attendance at more than a million.
The accusations made in person by officials, like the one mentioned earlier, were echoes of a narrative being taken up in earnest by China's Communist Party-controlled media.
The morning after the march, an English language editorial in the China Daily raised the spectre of ""interference"".
""Unfortunately, some Hong Kong residents have been hoodwinked by the opposition camp and their foreign allies into supporting the anti-extradition campaign,"" it said.
From the protesters' point of view, the dismissal of their grievances as externally driven explains, to a large extent, what happened next.
The city's political elite, backed by Beijing and insulated from ordinary Hong Kongers by a political system rigged in its favour, demonstrated a spectacular failure to accurately read the public mood.
Three days after the march, with Hong Kong's leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, insisting she would not back down, thousands of people surrounded the Legislative Council building where the bill was being debated.
It was on the same spot just outside the chamber, less than five years earlier, that a phalanx of trucks with mechanical grabbers had begun scooping up rows of abandoned tents.
To the sound of the snapping of poles and the crunching of bamboo barricades - the detritus of weeks of protest and occupation - 2014's pro-democracy demonstrations finally ran out of steam.
Now the proposed law, one that may once have been seen as relatively inconsequential, was about to reignite the movement.
The protesters threw bricks and bottles, the police fired tear gas and by the evening of 12 June, Hong Kong had witnessed one of its worst outbreaks of violence in decades.
No-one could be in any doubt that the Umbrella Movement, with its demands for wider democratic reform, was back with a vengeance.
The few concessions - first the suspension and finally the withdrawal of the bill - came too late to stop the cycle of escalating violence from both the protesters and the police.
Beijing is right to point out that there are plenty of Hong Kongers who deplore the mask-clad militants building barricades, vandalising public property and setting fires.
Some of them are ardent supporters of Chinese rule, others are simply being pragmatic, believing that violence will only provoke the central government into intervening more strongly in Hong Kong's affairs.
But the authorities were stunned last month by a test of the true strength of those viewpoints, when - on a record turnout in local elections - the pro-democracy camp swept the board.
The poll gave its candidates almost 60% of the total share of the votes.
At first there was an astonished silence from mainland China, which had genuinely thought the pro-Beijing side would win.
The initial news reports mentioned only the conclusion of the voting, not the results, but then came a familiar refrain.
The state-run Xinhua news agency blamed ""rioters"" conspiring with ""foreign forces"".
""The politicians behind them who are anti-China and want to mess up Hong Kong reaped substantial political benefits,"" it said.
As proof of interference, China cites cases of foreign politicians voicing support for democracy or raising concerns about its erosion under Chinese rule.
It has also blamed Washington for passing a law mandating an annual assessment of Hong Kong's political freedoms as a pre-condition for continuing the territory's special trading status.
Xinhua has denounced it as ""a malicious political manipulation that seriously interferes with Hong Kong affairs"".
But no evidence has been produced of any outside forces co-ordinating or directing the protests on the ground.
In reality, the young, radical protesters, with the ubiquitous use of the portmanteau ""Chinazi"" in their street graffiti, appear as much motivated by statements from Beijing as they are from Washington.
The very institutions - independent courts and a free press - that are supposed to be protected by the ""one country, two systems"" formula, are derided by the ruling Communist Party as dangerous, foreign constructs.
Where once Hong Kongers might have hoped that China's economic rise would bring political freedoms to the mainland and a closer alignment with their values, many now fear the opposite.
Mass detention camps in Xinjiang, a wider crackdown on civil society, and the abduction of Hong Kong citizens for perceived political crimes have all underlined the concern that their city is now ruled by political masters inherently hostile to the very things that make it special.
And any appeal to universal values as underwriting Hong Kong's side of the ""two systems"", is anathema to Beijing, one that it rejects by conflating it with outside foreign meddling.
Despite earlier fears, the central government seems unlikely to send in the army - a move certain to provoke even more of an international outcry.
But nor can it offer a political solution.
Giving the pro-democracy movement any more of what the Communist Party strains every fibre of its organisational structure to deny to the mass of Chinese people is impossible.
Its values are stability and control, not freedom and democracy, and it struggles to understand how anyone would choose the latter over the former.
So Beijing finds itself bound by a sense of historical destiny to a territory with which it is - in large part - in deep ideological opposition.
It is a tension that has not gone unnoticed elsewhere in the region, in particular, in Taiwan, the self-governing island that China considers a breakaway province.
Hong Kong's experience of one country, two systems, the Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen has suggested, has shown that authoritarianism and democracy cannot coexist.
Referring to the prospect of a similar formula being foisted on Taiwan she tweeted, in Chinese characters, the phrase bu ke neng - ""Not a chance""."
"Usain Bolt is no longer a   Olympic gold medalist. Bolt and the Jamaican team have been stripped of their   relay gold medal from the Beijing Games in 2008 because one runner, Nesta Carter, was found guilty of a doping violation, the International Olympic Committee said on Wednesday. Bolt won the 100 meters, the 200 and the 4x100 relay at the last three Summer Olympics, for a total of nine gold medals, tied for the most of any track athlete. Carter initially tested negative after the race in 2008. But his sample was one of many retested by the I. O. C. last year. It was found to contain a prohibited stimulant, methylhexaneamine. Carter’s lawyer told Reuters on Wednesday that he intended to file an appeal of the ruling to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Olympic officials last year intensified scrutiny of samples from past Olympics after Russia was found to have executed an elaborate,   doping scheme. Dozens of athletes from the Beijing and London Games have been found, upon retesting of their stored samples, to be guilty of doping violations. Many were medalists. It is standard practice for Olympic officials to store urine samples for up to a decade so they may conduct additional tests, often with more advanced, newly developed techniques. Carter was also a part of the winning 4x100 relay team in London in 2012, but no announcement about the status of that medal has been made. The I. O. C. directed the international track federation to “modify the results” of the 2008 event. Trinidad, Japan and Brazil were second, third and fourth in the race and would each move up a notch. The United States dropped the baton in its heat and did not make the final. The I. O. C. also told the Jamaican federation to secure the return of the physical gold medals. The other two team members in the final were Asafa Powell and Michael Frater. The Jamaican team finished in 37. 10 seconds, which was a world record at the time. When one member of a team tests positive, it is typical for the entire team to be stripped of its medals, although there have been exceptions. Marion Jones lost two relay medals from 2000 after doping violations, but her teammates were allowed to keep theirs after an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. When news of Carter’s positive test first emerged last year, Bolt told The Guardian, “It’s heartbreaking because over the years you’ve worked hard to accumulate gold medals and work hard to be a champion  —   but it’s just one of those things. ” He added, “If I need to give back my gold medal, I’d have to give it back it’s not a problem for me. ” The I. O. C. also announced on Wednesday that Tatiana Lebedeva of Russia was disqualified from the 2008 long jump, in which she won the silver medal, and the triple jump because of a positive test. Bolt, regarded as the greatest sprinter in history, has said he will retire from the sport after this summer’s world championships in London."
"Australia’s PM Rudd, Santa Clause of the Global Warming Industry, wants to waste another $100 M per year of other people’s money on his Carbon Capture and Storage Institute.
All life on earth depends on our atmosphere for four essentials – oxygen, water, carbon and nitrogen. This foolish Institute aims to permanently sterilise two of them, carbon and oxygen. It destroys valuable resources and wastes extra energy doing it.
Every tonne of carbon buried in CO2 by CCS takes almost 3 tonnes of oxygen with it. It is more accurately referred to as Oxygen Capture and Burial (OCB).
Planets like earth gradually lose their life-sustaining atmosphere and end up as lifeless planets like Moon and Mars. It just takes time.
The essentials of life are already being continually lost by other processes, largely locked up in rocks as limestone or coal, lost to space, or buried in ocean sediments, land fill or human cemeteries.
These buried treasures are lost for eons, maybe forever, to the cycle of life. The OCB scheme would deliberately accelerate that deathly process.
Burning coal and oil, smelting metals, mining phosphate and calcining cement make small contributions to reverse this long term disappearance of essential elements from our atmosphere and biosphere.
There are no climate benefits of this silly proposal because CO2 in the atmosphere does not control climate – the tiny effect of man’s CO2 emissions is wholly beneficial.
The OCB Scheme will provide cushy jobs and Frequent Flyer Points for the Climate Change Industry, jobs losses in every real industry, and soaring costs in every home.
Green extremists know that OCB is a fantasy but see it as a weapon to cripple carbon industries with taxes, thus making solar and wind power look economic.
Our PM should reduce his carbon footprint and come home.
Australia cannot afford a world statesman.

"**A boy aged 12 has become the youngest person convicted of an offence connected to Hong Kong's anti-government protests, local media say.**
The child, who cannot be named, was arrested on his way to school the day after a demonstration in October.
He admitted causing criminal damage by spray-painting slogans on a police station and a metro station, and will be sentenced next month.
There have been more than 5,000 arrests since the protests started in June.
A number of these have been children between the ages of 12 and 15, although this is the first time one of them has been convicted.
Prosecutors told a magistrate's court that a plain-clothes police officer saw the child spray ""damn rogue cops"" and ""divine annihilation, free HK"" on the walls of Mong Kok Police Station and Prince Edward MTR station on 3 October.
The officer then followed the boy home and waited outside all night, according to South China Morning Post.
When the child left for school at 07:00 (23:00 GMT) the following morning, the officer intercepted him and conducted a search of his home, where black paint was found.
The boy's lawyer, Jacqueline Lam, told the court he was held overnight at a police station after his arrest, which had been an ""important lesson"" for him.
""I ask the court to give him a chance,"" she said. ""After all, he's just 12 years of age.""
Protests first started in June, sparked by a proposed bill that would have allowed the authorities to extradite criminal suspects to mainland China.
Hong Kong is a part of China, but as a former British colony enjoys freedoms not seen on the mainland.
Although the bill itself has been withdrawn, protesters are continuing to demand an inquiry into police brutality, and amnesty for everyone who has been arrested.
But ultimately, the movement has at its root a fear - especially among young people - that their unique identity is under threat from China.
This week, they have focused on a siege of Hong Kong's Polytechnic University (PolyU) campus, which turned into a fiery battleground with police firing tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters. In turn, demonstrators threw Molotov cocktails and shot arrows.
More than 1,000 people have been arrested so far and accused of rioting, while hundreds of others have fled the campus amid a shortage of food and hypothermia-inducing temperatures. Police said hundreds of the protesters were under the age of 18.
Although the siege is nearing an end, dozens of people remain inside."
"For an animal that looks like a soggy fur ball with the feet of a duck in need of a pedicure and a tail cut from an old tyre, the beaver’s public image is doing rather well lately. That’s despite centuries of hunting that caused the Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber) to disappear from the UK during the 1500s. Now they’re back. In 2015, two beaver families were released on the River Otter in Devon. Researchers followed this reintroduced population and tracked their distribution and health. They also monitored how the amphibious rodents affected river flow and other wildlife, along with any disruption on adjacent land. By 2019, there were at least seven breeding pairs that had spread throughout the river catchment, well beyond the release sites. The results of the five-year trial are striking. The beavers built dams, creating wetland and ponds that slowed down peak river flows that might have caused flooding. Their engineering holds back water in the catchment area, stopping it from running off the land quickly and overloading the river, creating a bottle neck in towns downstream.  This glowing report on the flood prevention skills of beavers couldn’t be better timed. Two winter storms, Ciara and Denis, have recently brought flooding to thousands of homes in the UK. In November 2019, the National Trust, a charity more associated with stately homes, released beavers on Exmoor, also in Devon, with much of the publicity at the time touting the likely benefits they’ll bring to flood-prone homes nearby. Wildlife has benefited from the beavers too. The small pools created by the dams had 37% more fish than comparable stretches of the river. That’s helped local birds that eat fish, while rare water voles have been able to find refuge from invasive mink in newly wetted channels. Young trout prefer the faster water of washed out dams and have been spotted leaping over intact dams during high river flows. The River Otter backs up data from shorter term studies set over smaller areas that show beaver dams benefit the diversity of freshwater invertebrates, reduce nutrient levels in outflow, filter pollution and allow sediment to settle out and bury carbon. Just as importantly, the report doesn’t shy away from raising the challenges of returning a large mammal to a landscape heavily altered by humans. Beavers burrowed and blocked some culverts, while some of the trees they felled blocked paths. They ate some maize crop (£1.33 worth, gross) and gnawed an orchard tree.  The greatest potential drawback was flooding of productive farmland. There’s a risk that these outcomes cause people to rapidly degenerate into two mutually hostile camps – those with an anti-beaver outlook that portray rewilders as naïve townies, trying to force their eco-warrior views on country folk versus a pro-beaver lobby that sees opponents as habitat-wrecking landowners who don’t care about the environment and are only interested in animals they can shoot. Thankfully, there is none of this in the River Otter report. Instead, there’s recognition of concern and examples of rapid action that can deal with problems.

      Give beavers permanent residence – we'd be dam stupid not to


 The recent report feels a far cry from the one produced after the first official beaver reintroduction trial, which ran in Knapdale, Scotland from 2009-2014. From start to finish the Knapdale project was circumscribed with cautious language, and the beavers were described as fenced in and heavily monitored. These legally permitted beavers were allowed but only under strict guard. Despite this, illegal beavers started appearing elsewhere, most conspicuously on the River Tay, also in Scotland, perhaps since 2011, according to the “Save the Free Beavers of the Tay” Facebook group. Their presence caused the usual mix of delight and anger, and in 2010 Scottish Natural Heritage planned to remove them. But the death of a Scottish beaver called Erica that had been rounded up was a public relations mess. Once an animal has a name and can endear human observers, you better be sure it doesn’t die in your custody. Bowing to public pressure, the Scottish government granted beavers full legal protection in 2019. Beavers look to be on the way back, all over the UK. Quite how they will get around isn’t entirely clear yet, but there seems to be widespread public and political support, and it may be that they will spread by themselves. That will surely be better than the 1948 reintroduction of beavers in Idaho, in the US. Here, the hapless rodents were boxed up and the crates dropped by parachute from low flying aeroplanes.  The plan worked, apart from the one beaver that managed to climb onto the top of its airborne box only to jump off at the last minute. As the Chronicles of Narnia showed, tea and cakes are more a beaver’s thing than extreme sports."
"The largest and most symbolic glacier in the Dolomites could vanish within 15 years because of global heating, Italian scientists have warned. The 3,343m Marmolada, located on the border of the Trentino and Veneto regions and known as the Queen of the Dolomites, has already lost more than 80% of its volume over the last 70 years.  Aldino Bondesan, a geophysics professor at the University of Padua and member of the Italian Glaciological Committee, said forecasts of the glacier’s extinction were getting closer. “In the short-term, there is nothing we can do to save it,” Bondesan said. “Because the trend of glaciers in Italy, and of those worldwide, can only be reversed if there is a global effort and a reduction of the climate change in progress.” Bondesan said the sharp drop in carbon emissions during the coronavirus lockdown had only a minimal influence on helping to reverse the trend for Marmolada and other glaciers. “It didn’t last long and things are getting back to normal,” he added. Marmolada has been measured every year since 1902 and is considered a “natural thermometer” of climatic change. The glacier’s ice volume has fallen from 95m cubic metres in 1954 to 14m today. “It’s the largest and most symbolic glacier in the Dolomites and responds better than others to climate change,” Bondesan said. “So the variations in volume and dimensions give a clear and immediate indication of climatic changes.” The Italian Glaciological Committee monitors 200 of Italy’s 900 glaciers. The results of the latest study on Marmolada will be sent to the World Glacier Monitoring Service and published in the Journal of Glaciology. The warning over Marmolada comes less than a month after homes were evacuated in a hamlet of Courmayeur, in the Aosta valley, following a renewed alert that a huge portion of the Mont Blanc glacier, Planpincieux, was at risk of collapse. The movement of the glacial mass was due to “anomalous temperature trends”, experts said. Planpincieux has been closely monitored since 2013 to detect the speed at which the ice is melting. In August 2018, a heavy storm unleashed a debris flow, killing an elderly couple when their car was swept from the road, which is currently closed. In the event of a collapse, it would take less than two minutes for the mass to reach the municipal road below."
"**Hong Kong has seen months of protests sparked by a highly controversial plan to allow extraditions to mainland China.**
The government had argued the proposed amendments would ""plug the loopholes"" so that the city would not be a safe haven for criminals.
But critics said those in the former British colony would be exposed to China's deeply flawed justice system, and it would lead to further erosion of the city's judicial independence.
After months of protests which often developed into violence, the bill was officially withdrawn, but that has failed to stop the unrest.
The existing extradition law specifically states that it does not apply to ""the Central People's Government or the government of any other part of the People's Republic of China"".
But the proposed changes would have allowed for the Hong Kong government to consider requests from any country for extradition of criminal suspects, even countries with which it doesn't have an extradition treaty and including mainland China, Taiwan and Macau.
So people wanted for crimes in those territories could potentially be sent there to face trial.
The requests would be decided on a case-by-case basis by the chief executive.
Several commercial offences, such as tax evasion, were removed from the list of extraditable offences amid concerns from the business community.
Hong Kong officials always said Hong Kong courts would have the final say whether to grant such extradition requests, and suspects accused of political and religious crimes would not be extradited.
The government sought to reassure the public with some concessions, including promising to only hand over fugitives for offences carrying maximum sentences of at least seven years.
The proposal came after a 19-year-old Hong Kong man allegedly murdered his 20-year-old pregnant girlfriend while holidaying in Taiwan together in February 2018. The man fled Taiwan and returned to Hong Kong last year.
Taiwanese officials sought help from Hong Kong authorities to extradite the man, but Hong Kong officials said they could not comply because of a lack of extradition agreement with Taiwan.
But the Taiwanese government has said it would not seek to extradite the murder suspect under the proposed changes, and urged Hong Kong to handle the case separately.
Critics said people would be subject to arbitrary detention, unfair trial and torture under China's judicial system.
""The proposed changes to the extradition laws will put anyone in Hong Kong doing work related to the mainland at risk,"" said Human Rights Watch's Sophie Richardson in a statement earlier this year.
""No one will be safe, including activists, human rights lawyers, journalists, and social workers.""
Lam Wing Kee, a Hong Kong bookseller, said he was abducted, detained and charged with ""operating a bookstore illegally"" in China in 2015 for selling books critical of Chinese leaders.
In late April, Mr Lam fled Hong Kong and moved to Taiwan where he was granted a temporary residency visa.
""If I don't go, I will be extradited,"" Mr Lam said during a recent protest against the bill. ""I don't trust the government to guarantee my safety, or the safety of any Hong Kong resident.""
Opposition to the law was widespread from the start, with groups from all sections of society - ranging from lawyers to housewives - voicing their criticism or starting petitions.
Hundreds of petitions against the amendments started by university and secondary school alumni, overseas students and church groups also appeared online.
Lawyers, prosecutors, law students and academics marched in silence and called on the government to shelve the proposal.
Hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets for many weekends in a row in some of the largest demonstration since the territory was handed over to China by the British in 1997.
Several countries also expressed concern.
A US congressional commission said in May it risked making Hong Kong more susceptible to China's ""political coercion"" and further erode Hong Kong's autonomy.
Britain and Canada said they were concerned over the ""potential effect"" that the proposed changes would have on UK and Canadian citizens in Hong Kong.
The European Union also issued a diplomatic note to Mrs Lam expressing concerns over the proposed changes to the law.
China's foreign ministry has refuted such views, calling them attempts to ""politicise"" the Hong Kong government proposal and interference in China's internal affairs.
Carrie Lam indefinitely delayed the bill in mid-June, but that was followed by one of the largest protests, as opponents demanded it be revoked entirely.
Ms Lam later reiterated that the bill was ""dead"" and would expire when the Legislative Council's term ended next year. But that failed to stop or slow the protests.
In October, when LegCo convened after the summer break, it formally scrapped the law.
But by that point, protests were entrenched and had developed into wider anger against the government and over allegations of police brutality.
A former British colony, Hong Kong is semi-autonomous under the principle of ""one country, two systems"" after it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
The city has its own laws and its residents enjoy civil liberties unavailable to their mainland counterparts.
Hong Kong has entered into extradition agreements with 20 countries, including the UK and the US, but no such agreements have been reached with mainland China despite ongoing negotiations in the past two decades.
Critics have attributed such failures to poor legal protection for defendants under Chinese law.

When **Helen Clark** and **Michael Cullen** introduced Kiwisaver in 2007, the best thing about the scheme was that it was independent of government interference. Sure, contributions are collected by IRD, along with other payroll deductions if you are an employee, but the contributions are then transferred to your fund untouched. I had a number of clients at the time say they refused to go into Kiwisaver because they didn’t want the government meddling with, or confiscating their retirement savings. I told them that couldn’t possibly happen; IRD collecting the contributions was merely a convenient way of paying into your fund, and anyway, if you are self-employed, as many were, then you pay your contributions directly into your fund yourself.



What a naive fool I was.



The government is revamping KiwiSaver rules to ban investing in fossil fuels and illegal weapons, and improve investment returns. 



Commerce Minister Kris Faafoi said banning investment in fossil fuel companies would help combat climate change and carbon emissions.



“It also makes sense for the funds themselves given that there is a risk of investing in stranded assets as the world moves to reduce emissions.”



So the government now knows more about fund management and investments than fund managers do? I think not.



The default funds will also be banned from investing in companies making land mines, cluster bombs, and other illegal weapons.



KiwiSaver default funds are allocated to people who do not make a choice when they join the retirement savings scheme.



There are currently nine providers, including the four big banks, and their licences expire in 2021.



So we are now saying that Kiwisaver funds are banned from investing in companies such as BP, Shell (and presumably the publicly listed Z Energy), Mobil, Caltex… even though they produce products that most of us use on a daily basis? Doesn’t this strike you as somewhat hypocritical?



Also, avoiding the companies mentioned above is probably straightforward, but in fact, it is not quite that simple.



What about ANZ, BNZ or Westpac, with their huge loans to Australian mining companies? As one commentator put it to Newsroom: “A decent whack of KiwiSaver funds are going to Australia and if you are investing in Australian banks you are knee deep in fossil fuels.” 



What about companies that are huge users of (and therefore encouragers of) fossil fuels production? Toyota or Volkswagen, the world’s largest producers of fossil fuel-driven cars; Fonterra, whose coal-fired milk processing plants make it one of the country’s top CO2 emitters; Air NZ, whose search for alternative fuel sources hasn’t come to much so far. 



It seems like all we can do is invest in farming support companies like Wrightsons – oh wait – don’t they use large trucks to transport their products around the country? Can’t go there. OK then – how about Steel and Tube Ltd – a nice safe NZ company. But… don’t they use coal in steelmaking? Can’t go there either. Never mind. We’ll go with Contact Energy Ltd… that owns part of the Kupe gas field. Can’t go there either. 



In fact, I challenge you to think of a single company to invest in that doesn’t rely on fossil fuels somewhere along the line.



It seems unlikely that any fund is going to be able to steer completely clear from fossil fuel users or emitters, and needless to say, the government’s guidelines are typically vague about how the new rules will be applied.



A much bigger worry is the question of how such restrictions will hamstring the performance of such funds. Until now, we have left the management of **Kiwisaver** funds to fund managers, as these experts are, strange though it may seem, the best qualified to handle the funds and to get the best returns from them.



The government knows best, of course. Silly me.



The answer to this is simple. If you are in Kiwisaver, make sure you are not in a default fund. That way, you can burn as much fossil fuel as your fund managers will allow, and invest in companies that produce good returns, not those that an ideologically driven government decides are not good investments.



The funds will also not be allowed to invest in companies that produce ‘illegal weapons’, such as land mines and cluster bombs. Okay. I can understand that, I suppose. But here’s the thing. Let’s talk about Lockheed Martin. They produce weapons, and as such may well be considered an unethical investment for Kiwisaver funds. But they also produce rescue helicopters, GPS systems, pilot training systems, train managements systems and even fire control helicopters. So, we shouldn’t be investing in any of those products?



You can see how ridiculous this whole thing will become.



For me, however, the bottom line is this. Your Kiwisaver funds are yours and yours alone, and only you should have the right to decide where they are invested. The Government should not under any circumstances be meddling in people’s retirement savings, as this will distort the market. Many people are in default schemes, and some may be in a default scheme by choice. It could also be that existing funds of choice may become default funds, as the government forces default funds into the category of ‘balanced’ funds. The role of the fund manager is to get the best returns for their investors, and nothing else. They do not, and should not, have to pander to an ideologically driven government that is failing on every front so far.



Once again, Nanny State knows best. Of course, it does. 



Comrade.

"Brent Musburger is calling it a career at ESPN after being the    man in the booth at sporting events enjoyed by millions of Americans, most prominently when he was the lead voice for CBS Sports in the 1980s. Musburger, who is 77, said he was leaving active sportscasting to help his family get a sports handicapping business started and to use some of the millions of airline miles he has earned for recreational travel. His last game will be the   men’s basketball game Tuesday night. That takes him back to Rupp Arena, where he called Villanova’s upset over Georgetown in the final of the N. C. A. A. tournament in 1985. Musburger and ESPN said his comments about the Oklahoma football player Joe Mixon that were criticized as insensitive during the Sugar Bowl this month had nothing to do with his exit. On the broadcast, Musburger said that he hoped Mixon, who had been suspended for a year after punching a woman and breaking her jaw, would make the most of his second chance. He did not initially talk about Mixon’s victim. A former sportswriter, Musburger’s broadcast fame took off through his work on “N. F. L. Today,” the pro football pregame show. He broadcast the N. B. A. college basketball, the Masters golf tournament and tennis  —   most of CBS’s marquee events. He was behind the mike for one of college football’s most memorable plays, Doug Flutie’s “Hail Mary” pass that beat Miami for Boston College in 1984. He confessed to Flutie later that it took him awhile to identify Gerard Phelan, Flutie’s roommate, as the receiver of that pass  —   and Flutie told him he didn’t know, either, until he had run off the field. Musburger was abruptly dropped by CBS in 1990 in what was perceived as a salary dump, then went to work for ABC and ESPN. “Brent made every event feel larger,” said Stephanie Druley, ESPN senior vice president for events and studio production. “To me, there is probably not a greater storyteller as a    person. He can spin a yarn like nobody else, and it made games definitely more enjoyable to watch. ” Musburger’s opportunities for national exposure grew more limited in recent years when ESPN assigned him to its SEC Network for college football. But he still called college basketball regularly, and even though ESPN has been trying to save money lately by cutting   talent, Druley said the network had no interest in seeing him leave. Sportscasting today “has become more and more numbers driven, advanced statistics and everything,” Musburger said. “That’s fine. I was never going to change because I’m a people guy. I like pulling up a chair in a saloon with a cold beer and telling stories. ” Musburger took heat in 2013 when he extolled the attractiveness of an Alabama quarterback’s girlfriend, a controversy he found silly. “I called a beauty queen beautiful,” he said. “Are you kidding me?” He said he hoped people felt comfortable listening to him. “Not everyone approved of everything I said,” he said. “I understand that. I come from a sportswriting background, and I’m not afraid to take a position on certain things from time to time. But for the most part, I thought people should be coming to a game to escape for three hours and forget about what their individual problems are. ” He said he was not ready to fully retire (“I don’t do shuffleboard well,” he said) but his decision lets ESPN escape from an uncomfortable decision. Having a broadcaster of college games publicly identified with a sports handicapping business wouldn’t fly. That accounts for the odd timing of his departure in the middle of the college basketball season his family wants the site fully operational by the N. C. A. A. men’s basketball tournament. If anything, the move will force Musburger to change a pat answer when he is approached by fans. “They always ask me my favorite game, and I always say, ‘The next one,’ ” he said. After Tuesday, that will no longer be applicable."
"When Indira Islas was in third grade at Centennial Arts Academy, a public elementary school in Gainesville, Ga. she decided it was time to get serious. It was 2006, and she was in the lowest reading group in her class. She had been in that group since arriving two years earlier, speaking no English, in Gainesville, a city of 38, 000 just northeast of Atlanta’s booming outer suburbs. But being at the bottom went against everything she believed about herself. “I wanted to be with the smart kids,” she recalls. Starting the year before, in second grade, she read every volume of the “Magic Tree House” books in her   library, a series about two ordinary siblings who climb into their backyard treehouse and   to Pompeii, the Wild West, the ice age, feudal Japan and beyond. “I absolutely loved them,” she says. “It was like going on adventures all over the world. ” It was also the opposite of her own life. Indira left Mexico for the United States at age 6 with her parents and two younger sisters. Her mother cleaned houses when she wasn’t caring for the children  —   there would eventually be seven of them  —   and her father worked in construction, and there was no money for   lessons or soccer clubs, let alone traveling. “I’d hear about trips and experiences of my white friends, and I remember thinking: I’ll never go to the beach or Disney World for spring break,” Indira says. Her parents told her that education was all that mattered, and she had to spend all her free time inside, reading and writing. “I tell my children this country is a blessing to all the people living here,” her mother told me. “If you have the opportunity to be good, it’s very important to take it. ” Indira took this advice to heart. By the time she was in fifth grade, her reading skills had improved so much that she tested into the top reading group. By middle school, she consistently got A’s, which qualified her for a celebratory school trip every time report cards came out. “They rewarded us by taking us skating or bowling,” she says. “I felt like I was so smart, just getting the chance to go out for the whole school day with friends. That’s when I said: ‘I can make it. ’’u2009” Indira began to throw herself into everything. At recess, she played soccer and basketball, competing so fiercely that everyone took notice. Boys usually picked other boys for their teams, and white kids tended to favor other white kids. But everyone started picking Indira. In middle school, she was on the track team, running   races. Her coach was stunned by her determination. In meets, even when she won her event, she scolded herself unless she broke her previous record. After practices ended, she would keep running. “I wanted to think,” she says. “I’d stay after practice and run and run and run. ” Indira remembers understanding vaguely that it wasn’t just poverty that set her and her family apart. Her parents had been doctors in Mexico. She admired pictures in their dresser drawer of the two of them in their 20s standing together, tall and proud in their white coats  —   before they all fled the violence of drug gangs who were then taking over their home state, Guerrero. When she asked her parents why they were no longer doctors, they explained it was because they were not American citizens. It didn’t make sense to Indira. Why would her father have shed that beautiful crisp white coat for the fraying pants and shirts he now wore? Soon after Indira turned 13, in 2011, she was riding home from track practice with her mother when another car sideswiped the family’s Ford Expedition. The other driver, who was at fault, insisted on calling the police, according to Indira and a lawyer who assisted the family. Indira pleaded not to involve the police, explaining that her mother did not have a driver’s license because she was not an American citizen. (In Georgia and most other states, undocumented immigrants cannot obtain driver’s licenses.) But the driver said she needed a police report to get insurance to cover the damage to her car. A police officer arrived and asked for Indira’s mother’s license. When she said she did not have one  —   a state crime  —   she was told to get out of the car. Indira got out, too. She remembers two of her younger siblings sleeping in the back, one in a booster seat, one in a car seat. Two elders from the church they attended arrived to ask for mercy. She has seven children, they told the officer. He responded that he was simply enforcing the law. Indira’s mother turned to her and began to cry. “Indira, I don’t know what is going to happen,” she said. “They’re going to take me. ” Indira remembers remaining strangely calm. “When she was being handcuffed, I said: ‘Mom, everything is going to be O. K.’’u2009” Indira’s mother was held in Gainesville’s Hall County jail for three days, but that wasn’t the most frightening part for the family. Hall is one of four counties in Georgia that have a formal agreement to report arrests of undocumented immigrants to the Department of Homeland Security, which means that infractions as minor as a   bulb above a license plate can spiral into deportation proceedings. Indira’s mother says that her charge of driving without a license ultimately led to a referral to immigration court and a deportation order instructing her to leave the country within 30 days. She stayed, slipping into the shadows. Every day since, Indira says, she and her siblings have feared that their mother would be deported. It would take only one more traffic stop. “That woke me up,” Indira says. “Until then, I thought the world was happy. ” In fact, she now realized, it was only American citizens who seemed truly happy. “It must feel pretty good, I guess, to not have to worry about whether your family could be taken away any day. ” Indira has wanted to be a doctor for almost as long as she can remember. When she was 10, her family was shopping for groceries at Sam’s Club, and she spotted a large book about human anatomy. She became so excited about it that her parents bought it for her birthday, even though it was well above her reading level  —   and their price range. She began working her way through it, mesmerized, and when she got stuck, her mother would explain whatever had stumped her. She was determined to go to college and medical school and fulfill her parents’ interrupted dream. In her junior year, Indira began researching college options. She would be a strong applicant. She was consistently at or near the top of her class she was on the   track and soccer teams she volunteered over 1, 000 hours a year at the local hospital, a record in the history of the   program and she led her school’s chapter of the Hispanic Organization Promoting Education (HOPE) which encouraged Latino students  —   who made up just over half the district’s population  —   to stay in school and graduate. She was distressed to discover that Georgia barred undocumented immigrants from attending its top public universities and charged them    tuition at all others  —   triple the rate for citizen residents. She then turned to researching financial aid and learned that Congress barred her from accessing federal Pell grants, loans, scholarships and   jobs  —   the most common forms of assistance for   students. At first, she greeted this as just another set of obstacles to surmount, but as time went on, she began to despair. She would retreat to the classroom of her science teacher, Teresa Leach, who had become her mentor, in need of encouragement. “There were a couple of times when I just cried to her because I was tired,” she said. “I questioned myself if it was all worth the effort. ” All the while, Indira told me, she held onto her religious conviction that God had a plan, and that she must respect it. At a college fair attended by representatives of numerous Georgia colleges, she asked admissions officers what kind of help was available for undocumented students. No one had any to offer her. She switched her focus to private colleges and was admitted to Atlanta’s Agnes Scott, which she says awarded her $20, 000 annually in financial aid, less than half of what she needed. She researched   private scholarships and found two for undocumented students, but she was selected for neither. She was awarded seven small scholarships, which totaled $10, 000, enough to go to a nearby public commuter college for only one semester at the    tuition rate. Last May, Indira attended her graduation ceremony at Gainesville High School, but she had nowhere to go next. In every picture from that day, she wears a wide smile, but she was in pain inside, particularly when she caught a glimpse of her mother in the crowd, looking distraught. Unable to bring herself to celebrate with friends, she went home to be with her family. Days later, a friend told her about a philanthropic organization called TheDream. US, which was offering undocumented students full   scholarships to Delaware State University or Eastern Connecticut State University. The application was demanding, and only 76 students would be chosen. She poured herself into the essays, spending hours composing them alongside an English teacher, Cindy Lloyd. She applied to Delaware State, a historically black college in Dover, five hours closer to home than Eastern Connecticut. In late June, she received an email from TheDream. US. “I saw ‘Congratulations,’’u2009” she remembers, “and I read no more. ” In late August, Indira made the   drive with her parents from Gainesville to Delaware State in unusual silence. She was thinking hard about each of her six younger siblings, wondering how they would fare without her. Over breakfast at a Cracker Barrel in South Carolina, when her mother pressed her about how she was feeling, she talked only of her concerns about not being at home to help everyone. When she arrived on campus  —   a flat expanse of grassy courtyards and buildings amid strip malls, auto dealers and chain restaurants just beyond Dover’s historic capital area  —   she found 33 other “opportunity scholars,” just as worried and hopeful as she was. All of them were assigned to a dorm about a quarter of a mile from the D. S. U. campus, a former Sheraton hotel acquired a few years earlier by the university as part of an expansion. They bonded instantly, traveling as a posse from classes to the library to the cafeteria, often ending up together late at night in the dorm lobby or in a lounge that had been a large hotel suite on the second floor. In their first month on campus, the opportunity scholars were invited to a welcoming ceremony in the school’s Martin Luther King Jr. Student Center with Gov. Jack Markell the Democratic senator Tom Carper Donald Graham, a founder of TheDream. US and D. S. U. ’s president, Harry Williams. “This is not just an opportunity for you it is an opportunity for the state of Delaware,” Markell told them. “It is sad to see your own home state reject such talent and potential. ” He pronounced himself “thrilled that you’re here. ” It was the first time many of the students could recall being welcomed anywhere. “We felt rejection our whole lives from our own states,” Indira said. “We were here only three weeks, and we already met the governor and the senator. It felt like saying ‘Haha!’ to Georgia. ” Of the 34 opportunity scholars enrolled at D. S. U. 28 are from Mexico and one each is from Ecuador, El Salvador, Peru, Gabon, Gambia and Trinidad and Tobago. Their families are a composite portrait of the economic forces that have drawn undocumented immigrants to the nation’s small towns and metropolitan heartland. Their parents work in poultry plants, on factory lines, in warehouses, on construction sites, in restaurants they clean and paint houses and schools, tend gardens. “They make everything look perfect for the tourists,” Yulma Lopez, who left Mexico at age 3, said of her parents’ work for a landscaping company in Charleston, S. C. Almost all their parents work illegally, but many pay income taxes, having obtained federal   numbers. And some, including Indira’s father, have secured temporary federal permission to work and drive lawfully. While most of the students are 18 or 19, typical for college freshmen, some have worked for years in hopes of one day saving enough for college. Olivia Bekale, who is 27 and grew up in Baton Rouge, arrived in Louisiana from Gabon as a child. She graduated from high school in 2008 with a 3. 9 G. P. A. from the Louisiana School for Math, Science and the Arts, a prestigious   boarding school for top achievers. Unable to afford college, she cycled from one   position to the next  —   server at the Melting Pot, a fondue restaurant retail sales consultant for Sprint   agent for Marriott pharmacy tech for Walgreens. Olivia, who had wanted to be a doctor since an aunt died of AIDS when she was 5, had been out of high school for eight years when she learned of the opportunity scholarship she applied immediately. All but one of the students were enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, also known as DACA. Created in 2012 by an   executive action, DACA allowed teenagers and young adults who came to the United States illegally as children with their parents to register with the government and in turn receive a   renewable protection against deportation, along with work permits and Social Security numbers. Most of the students, like Indira, signed up at age 15, as soon as they were eligible. With DACA, Indira, who is now 18, was able to get a driver’s license and a job at a Publix supermarket when she was in high school, working 20 hours a week as a cashier and bagger. Being able to work and drive legally, free of the fears her mother faced, and fitting in with her classmates, Indira says, was “living the American dream. ” With her income from Publix, she even was able to get braces for her teeth. The starting point for all of their dreams was education, and the quest for it has been central to the experience of undocumented young people since long before Indira and her classmates were born. In the late 1970s, when undocumented immigrants had yet to move in large numbers beyond border states, Texas passed a law authorizing local school districts to ban them from public schools or charge them tuition. In a landmark decision in Plyler v. Doe in 1982, a narrowly divided Supreme Court struck down the law, finding that undocumented children had a constitutional right to free    public education. The opinion blamed a dysfunctional immigration system for creating the crisis by failing to keep out undocumented immigrants or provide them a path to citizenship. “Already disadvantaged as a result of poverty, lack of   ability and undeniable racial prejudices, these children, without an education, will become permanently locked into the lowest socioeconomic class,” Justice William Brennan wrote for the majority, quoting the   opinion. The case also introduced the argument that undocumented children were legally blameless, unlike their parents: “The classification at issue deprives a group of children of the opportunity for education afforded all other children simply because they have been assigned a legal status due to a violation of law by their parents,” Justice Lewis Powell wrote in a concurring opinion. Undocumented children poured into the nation’s schools over the next generation, and as they reached college age, they coalesced into a movement, advocating access to higher education as well as full citizenship. In 2001, they began calling themselves Dreamers, now an estimated 2. 1 million young immigrants who have grown up as Americans in almost every way except for their passports. The name came from the Dream Act (Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors) introduced in Congress in 2001 by Senator Richard Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, and Senator Orrin Hatch, a Republican from Utah, and for which activists fought for over a decade. The measure, which would have put undocumented children on a path to citizenship, never passed, but the vast network of Dreamers became a compelling political force. In 2001, hundreds of them turned out to testify in Texas in favor of legislation to allow undocumented residents to pay   college tuition if they graduated from Texas high schools and lived in the state for three years. “Something magical happened when those kids told their stories,” says the former Texas state representative Rick Noriega, a Democrat who sponsored the bill. “It was a humanizing of a very real issue dealing with children’s dreams and hopes. Every heart on that committee was touched, Republicans and Democrats. ” The legislation passed both houses almost unanimously and was signed by Rick Perry, then governor of Texas and now President Donald Trump’s pick for energy secretary. Texas became the first state, followed quickly by California, to allow Dreamers to pay   tuition. Today, 21 states charge Dreamers the same tuition as legal residents, including six carried by Trump  —   Florida, Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Utah and Texas. In many of those states, however, the   issue has turned politically treacherous. In Texas, efforts to repeal the tuition law come closer to passing every year, and Noriega says there is no chance the original measure would pass today. The leading national opponents of   tuition for Dreamers include the Republican senator Jeff Sessions, Trump’s choice for attorney general, and the secretary of state of Kansas, Kris Kobach, a Republican who was a leader of Trump’s transition team on immigration. Each argues that students who are in the United States illegally should not get a public benefit in any state that is denied to a citizen from another state. In other words, if Dreamers pay   tuition in Texas, citizen students next door in Arkansas and Oklahoma  —   or Massachusetts, for that matter  —   should have the same right. “How much sense does that make, to have people here illegally, and they have more benefits than those who are here legally?” Sessions asked in a Senate floor statement. Kobach used the same argument to bring   lawsuits against   tuition for Dreamers in Kansas and California. Judges found no legal basis for the claims and dismissed the cases. The larger debate over how to treat an estimated 11 million immigrants who came here illegally has been at a stalemate for decades, with advocates seeking a “path to citizenship” for   families who have been in the country for years and opponents denouncing “amnesty” for people who broke the law to enter the country. Amid hardening resistance in Congress to immigration reform, Dreamers brought pressure on Obama  —   including   and hunger strikes at his 2012 campaign offices  —   to use his executive power to create DACA. The program, announced on June 15, 2012, the 30th anniversary of the Supreme Court’s Plyler decision, proved transformative for Dreamers. They have entered college, taken    jobs, received driver’s licenses, bought cars. They now fly on planes, passing effortlessly through airport security. They still lack legal immigration status, but no longer are they exactly undocumented. “DACAmented,” many have called themselves. Even in states where they pay   tuition, Dreamers still struggle to afford college because they are disproportionately   and have no access to federal financial aid. Fewer than 10 percent of Dreamers who graduate from high school enroll in college. At a time when college graduates earn 70 percent more than those without degrees, these numbers conjure the 1982 warning by the Supreme Court that undocumented children could become a permanent underclass. In response, a handful of philanthropies have adopted the cause of sending students with DACA status to college. The biggest of these, TheDream. US, has raised $90 million to eventually finance 4, 000 students at public colleges, with significant contributions from Donald Graham, former publisher and chief executive of The Washington Post, and his family Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan Bill and Melinda Gates the   executive William Ackman and Michael Bloomberg, among others. (I was a reporter at The Washington Post from 1980 to 2008.) In 2014, TheDream. US began offering Dreamers full scholarships in states that charge them   tuition. Last year, in partnership with Delaware and Connecticut, the organization created the   program for students from the other 29 states, financed by $41 million in philanthropy from Graham and his family and two anonymous donors. The governors of Delaware and Connecticut agreed to charge roughly   tuition rates for the 34 scholars at Delaware State and the 42 at Eastern Connecticut State  —   a total of $80, 000 per student for tuition, room and board for four years. In an effort to   political opposition, Graham says, the philanthropy works only with schools, like Delaware State and Eastern Connecticut State, that have excess capacity, so that undocumented students are not displacing citizens. And private donors pay all expenses, so that no state dollars are spent. Still, when The Delaware State News ran an article in September about the D. S. U. opportunity scholars, the online comments complained that undocumented immigrants, not citizens, were benefiting. “Trump isn’t perfect, but I will vote for him because he puts Americans FIRST,” wrote a reader named John Huff of Magnolia, Del. “There are plenty of kids who are citizens who have the same dream and should come first. ” And as news of the scholarship spread on the Delaware campus this fall, a number of   students told Dreamers that they resented that their own families had to go into debt for a portion of their education costs while the DACA students got full scholarships. By then, Trump had mobilized   anger in large swaths of the country, having kicked off his campaign criticizing Mexican immigrants  —   “They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists”  —   and vowing to build a wall on the border to keep them out. In stump speeches, he promised to deport all 11 million undocumented immigrants and, in his first 100 days in office, to terminate DACA, labeling it “illegal amnesty. ” Both vows became instant applause lines. Indira declared her major in biological sciences at the beginning of the semester and started a demanding   curriculum with six classes, including biology and chemistry, both requiring labs. Her parents had insisted she not take a job, in order to devote herself to education, freeing up four hours a night that she had spent working in high school. With that extra time, she found the academic challenges manageable. Much harder was living apart from her   family for the first time in her life. Her mother texted her daily. “Good morning, hija,” she wrote one recent morning, using the Spanish word for daughter. “May God bless you today in school. Please be kind to everyone. ” That night, over FaceTime, Indira talked with two of her younger sisters, who like her were born in Mexico and are undocumented. One, a junior in high school, is already on a quest for college scholarships. She and Indira came up with potential essay ideas and discussed her résumé. Then Indira helped the other, a freshman who is the smartest of all the family’s children, Indira says, with physics homework. On weekends, she FaceTimes with her four youngest siblings  —   a sixth grader, a fourth grader, a third grader and a first grader  —   all of whom were born in Georgia and are citizens. Separation from family, from home, even from Mexican food made most of the opportunity scholars profoundly lonely. Estephany Martinez, a petite   major with long black hair, couldn’t stop thinking about her sisters in the first weeks. “Whenever we came home from school, all four sisters would sit in the living room and do our homework and talk and watch TV,” she recalled wistfully of her life in Winder, Ga. In Delaware, “I didn’t have anybody that cared for me. I didn’t have anyone to come home to. ” In early September, she summoned all the scholars to a gathering in the dorm’s   lounge. “All right, you guys, we’re going to be here for each other,” she said. “That part of our lives  —   being undocumented  —   is critical to who we are. We have to share our stories. ” Everyone crowded in, sitting on the sofa, spilling onto the floor, sitting shoulder to shoulder on counters that once were part of a kitchenette, sprawling into one another’s space. Carlos Gonzales of Manteo, N. C. a lanky and cheerful marketing major whose mother is a restaurant cook, broke down crying when he recalled the violence that drove his family from Mexico City. He, his mother and his younger sister moved to North Carolina when he was 7. It was his mother who encouraged him, beginning in elementary school, to reach for college. “I don’t want you to live the life we’re living now,” she told him. In high school, he was an honor student and varsity wrestler and runner, working nights and weekends at McDonald’s in his Outer Banks town. When he received the email telling him he was an opportunity scholar, he said: “I hugged my mom and cried for two hours. The only reason I stopped was I had to go to work. ” Indira told the harrowing story that led to her own family’s departure from Mexico. In 2004, when she was 6, three masked gunmen broke into their home, which housed her parents’ clinic, and robbed them of everything  —   money, jewelry, a new computer, a television, cameras and medications. They filed a report with the police, they said, who didn’t investigate, in deference to cartels then taking over Guerrero, now the most violent state in Mexico. An uncle of her father’s already had been killed. In subsequent years, a cousin of her mother’s, a veterinarian, was kidnapped and never found. Two nephews disappeared. Her mother’s sister has been kidnapped twice  —   most recently this past November  —   and returned only after her family paid steep ransoms. Weeks after the robbery, Indira’s family of five arrived in the United States on a tourist visa that her father procured a month earlier in hopes of taking everyone to Disney World. Instead, they went to Gainesville, where her father’s brother worked in construction  —   one of thousands of Mexican workers who flocked to the north Georgia community in the last 25 years, swelling the Hispanic population to more than 40 percent in 2013 from 8 percent in 1990. Indira said her parents are certain they would have been killed had they stayed. They decided to forfeit their careers for their family’s safety. “I no longer saw my future, but I saw my children’s future,” her father said to me. Antonio Patino, a   major who is a lifeguard and plays bass and guitar in his spare time, told the group about riding with his family in their car in 2015 in Lawrenceville, Ga. when a police officer pulled them over, though none of them understood why. His father, who is undocumented and processes returns for a local manufacturer, was driving but did not have a license. Antonio and his mother, younger sister and brother all watched in terror as his father was handcuffed, placed in a police cruiser and driven off to jail. As it turned out, he was released the next day after paying a fine of more than $800 and was not referred to immigration court for further proceedings, but the incident shook Antonio’s sense of belonging in America. “I felt like I got slapped in the face just for living, trying to be a normal person in this beautiful country,” he said. “It feels like a hole inside me. ” He said he now found himself gripped with fears for his parents’ safety at random moments during his days at D. S. U. It is as if he has swapped roles with his mother and father. “Like I’m now the parent and they’re the child, and I’m worried for them,” he told me. “Not being there, all these   swarm into my mind. What if out of nowhere they get pulled over again?” Calling them and hearing their voices usually comforts him. But after one such call, he said: “I went outside, and I had to cry a little. I was feeling like I couldn’t help them. ” A number of students shared the enormous sacrifices they had seen their parents make for them. Juan Chavez, 23, who grew up in Plymouth, Ind. and worked for five years after high school, told of his mother suffering a breakdown after her divorce from his father. He saw it as a response to the crushing instability of their lives, moving from one home to another in search of shelter. “She’s the strongest person I’ll ever know,” he said. “She’s my role model. My father figure as well as my mother. ” He continued: “I felt so helpless to make things better. I decided almost right then I’ll go to college and medical school if it takes me the rest of my life. ” He is now a psychology and   major, intending to become a psychiatrist. On and on the students went until almost 3 a. m. the common threads in their stories drawing them closer. It was the first time most of them had talked openly about being undocumented, but instead of feeling exposed, they felt safer. Until then, Antonio had gone out of his way to avoid conversations with   at D. S. U. about his scholarship, not wanting to have to explain that he got it because he was undocumented. The next day, though, he fell into conversation with a student who asked him how he happened to come all the way from Georgia to D. S. U. and he said without hesitation: “I got a scholarship. ” “What for?” “I’m undocumented,” Antonio said, surprised at how comfortable this felt. “O. K. man, that’s cool,” the student said. After their long night talking, the scholars also better understood what had propelled them all for as long as they could remember. Throughout high school, the opportunity scholars watched undocumented friends and siblings give up and drop out, shamed and beaten down by public scorn over illegal immigration and the   options awaiting even those who excelled in high school. But they kept on striving, steeled to the insults, positioning themselves for a breakthrough they couldn’t yet see. Now this all made sense. “This pain  —   it pushes us,” Estephany said. “It’s motivation. It has made me who I am. It makes me go through every day. ” “Now we know what drives us,” Indira said. One morning in   at 9:50 a. m. 10 minutes before Indira’s   class was scheduled to start, she and two other opportunity scholars were already ensconced in the three center   seats, notebooks, pens and textbooks at the ready. Indira was wearing a Harvard sweatshirt that a classmate bought for her when their   A. P.  class visited Boston. (Indira couldn’t afford to go.) “I’m going to get there one day,” she said with a confident smile. Most of the other students didn’t arrive until class was about to begin  —   or later  —   and there was little competition for the front rows. A similar scene unfolded that morning in the ultramodern science center, in   class, where Antonio and Jose Reyes Rios, another   major, sat front and center with an   classmate named Hanqaamo Lintisio, who is from Maryland and has a track scholarship. The three had formed a study group and tutored one another so effectively that they all scored above 100 on the midterm. (They nailed the bonus question.) Theirs were the only A’s in the class. The Dreamers gather daily at a long Formica table in a D. S. U. cafeteria for food and conversation. At lunch, Carla Moreno propped her English composition textbook, “Patterns for College Writing,” against a napkin holder, securing it with an apple. She paged through a chapter while eating her salad and chili dog. “It’s just a quiz,” she said, “but I want to keep my A. ” “I deal with a lot of students, and I feel like the Dreamers are at a different level,” says Kevin Noriega, the adviser for their scholarships. “They’re saying, ‘I’ve got to make this happen because it’s my only option. ’’u2009” Of the 488 scholars funded by TheDream. US who began college in 2014, 94 percent remain enrolled after their sophomore year research shows that only 66 percent of   college students nationally return after one year. “This is a   population with retention rates like Harvard’s,” Donald Graham says. Because beneficiaries of TheDream. US have full rides, they avoid a common problem faced by other disadvantaged students: running short of money for costs not covered by Pell grants or other forms of aid. One night in October before a biology exam, Indira went to the D. S. U. athletic center for a workout to relieve stress. She was armed with a stack of homemade flash cards and her iPhone, on which she had downloaded discussions of test topics from various websites. While pounding out three miles on the treadmill, she flipped through her study cards, then plugged in her earbuds for a YouTube lecture on glycolysis. Returning to her dorm, she sat down at her desk for a final review. Hanging on the wall in front of her was a collage of family photographs. One showed the whole family of nine around their dinner table. “When I’m struggling, I look at a picture of my mom or dad, and I say, ‘I’m working for that person,’’u2009” she said. That night, her studying complete, she took a last look at her parents’ picture and fell asleep listening to recordings of her biology professor’s lectures. She got an A on the exam. Indira’s determination to become a doctor requires more than a little imagination, because under current law in Georgia and many other states, licenses to practice medicine are reserved for citizens and legal residents. “I’m not planning my life based on the way things are today,” she said. “I’m thinking of the future. ” In her eyes, America is a land of   opportunity. Over Columbus Day weekend, she visited Washington for the first time with her roommate, Karen Baltazar, who is from Lawrenceville, Ga. and also wants to be a doctor. At the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial, Indira stood underneath Roosevelt’s Four Freedoms  —   freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want, freedom from fear  —   her arms raised high above her head, as if exulting in the message. Her smile was radiant. Karen snapped a picture, and Indira posted it on her Facebook page along with the caption, “I have never forgotten the reasons my parents brought me to this great country. ” Such unsinkable optimism, which I heard from many D. S. U. Dreamers in the early fall, is hard to maintain, and many of the estimated 65, 000 undocumented immigrants who graduate from high school every year  —   and thousands who drop out  —   simply can’t muster it. In a recent book, “Lives in Limbo,” Roberto G. Gonzales, an assistant professor at Harvard’s graduate school of education, writes that academically successful Dreamers are far outnumbered by those who become casualties of “the deeper and more   consequences of being undocumented: living in poverty, having parents and family members who also bear the burdens of being undocumented, watching friends moving forward but being unable to join them, watching opportunities pass you by, navigating a world of exclusions while constantly looking over your shoulder. ” At least some of the opportunity scholars’ optimism last fall came from their assumption, based on reported polls, that Hillary Clinton would be the next president. They were heartened by her speeches about keeping families together and pursuing comprehensive immigration reform. At the very least, they were confident that DACA would remain in effect under her leadership. Though they didn’t believe Trump could win, he unnerved them with his speeches branding Mexicans criminals who stole Americans’ jobs and lived off their tax dollars. They took this rhetoric as a personal affront and were horrified by the hatred they saw on the faces of those who cheered his words. “The only thing that depresses me is so many people support him,” Jose Reyes Rios, the   major, who aspires to work at Google one day, said in late September. On election night, a group of Dreamers gathered around the   TV in the dorm lobby, many of them studying as they watched returns. Indira had exams the next day in math and biology and arrived equipped with her flash cards. The mood turned dark after Trump won Florida. Everyone’s mind flooded with his vows that they had discounted until now  —   to revoke DACA, to deputize local police departments to enforce federal immigration laws. “We will issue detainers for all illegal immigrants who are arrested for any crime whatsoever, and they will be placed into immediate removal proceedings,” Trump said last summer in Arizona. As all of them knew well, these crimes included one of their parents’ daily activities  —   driving without a license. If DACA disappeared, and with it their Social Security numbers, their own driver’s licenses would be worthless. So would their federal work authorization, meaning most would lose the jobs that paid for their books, phones, clothes, travel home and anything else they needed. By 1 a. m. Indira became too distressed to concentrate. Olivia Bekale was one of four opportunity scholars who watched until Trump was declared the  . “We were just looking at each other and crying,” she says. “We hugged each other and went to our rooms. ” On the Sunday after the election, when they gathered in the dorm lobby, the opportunity scholars were struggling with something unfamiliar: despair. They had registered for DACA with the Department of Homeland Security, which now knew exactly where they were. “Life is going to be like it is for our parents,” said Victor Hernandez of Coats, N. C. stunned and shaking his head. “They could come pick us up and take us away any time. ” Social media brought aftershocks for all of them as they discovered that many of their best friends voted for Trump. Almost all of Antonio’s   swim teammates in Lawrenceville had Trump filters on their Facebook and Snapchat profile pictures. “All I could think was: You voted against me,” he said. “What did I do to you?” The day after the election, Indira couldn’t bear to call her mother until the afternoon. Instead, she confided her fears in text messages to her former science teacher, Teresa Leach. “I’ve never been so disappointed in this country,” she wrote. “I’ve never felt so powerless. . .. I’m scared about my family, my mom. . .. Not sure if I’ll even get my degree, much less go to medical school here. ” When Indira finally did call home, her mother insisted she was not afraid and told Indira that education was now even more important. Several of Indira’s friends back home told her they doubted Trump would follow through on all his campaign promises, and in any case, they couldn’t imagine he would target her. “These are people who helped me get to where I am, who remind me they love me, and I love them,” she said. “But they’ll never understand what we feel. They say, ‘He won’t do that.’ Do they think he’s going to send back all the immigrants except Indira?” A lifeline of sorts arrived the week after the election, when the students received letters from TheDream. US, Governor Markell and the president of D. S. U. pledging to stand behind their scholarships no matter what became of DACA. Donald Graham lined up attorneys to represent them if anyone challenged their right to be in school. But their bigger fears were for their parents. Antonio and Indira went home for Christmas to find their families filled with trepidation. “We’re trying to be invisible, trying to stay hidden,” Antonio’s father said, “do only the things we have to do to live, like go to work, go buy groceries. ” During the 2015 holiday season, they took a driving tour of the Christmas lights and celebrated New Year’s Eve in downtown Lawrenceville. “Now we can’t go to any festivities because for us it’s very dangerous,” his mother told me in their apartment in a complex in Buford, Ga. “There are a lot of police there. ” Antonio’s father said he worries about driving his daughter, Litzy, 15, home from her   practice at rush hour, when the police presence increases. Litzy was born in Georgia, and he thought of asking her to leave the team until she is old enough to drive because, as a citizen, she will be able to get a driver’s license. “But then I said to myself: ‘No! That’s crazy. That’s why we’re here  —   for our kids. So they can take advantage of every opportunity. ’’u2009” He continues to ferry her  —   carefully  —   during rush hour. Indira found her mother more frightened than at any time since receiving her deportation order. Her mother says she has no choice but to drive when someone at her church asks for help, when her children call for rides home and when she is needed at a charity medical clinic where she volunteers as a doctor’s assistant and translator. “Life changed after the election,” she told me in December, in her living room decorated with framed academic awards for each child. She was surrounded by her kids, who listened carefully. “The children know I don’t have a driver’s license. They know at any time maybe the police will take me again. ‘If I can’t come back,’ I tell them, ‘you have to go to school every day. You have to study hard  —   even harder. ’’u2009” By the time Indira and the other opportunity scholars returned to campus in January, all of them had come to the same conclusion: There was now only one thing they could control  —   their education. “The only way we can fight back is to excel in school,” Indira wrote to me in a text message. She felt weary in the aftermath of the election, but when she had this epiphany, she said: “I wasn’t tired anymore. I had that drive, that hunger to just come out on top. I was angry. I was staying at the library longer, going to the gym a lot more. ” Estephany Martinez focused on her life’s mission. “My goal is being a police chief  —   something that makes my voice louder,” said the   major. “I have to educate myself to get there. I want to show people who don’t believe in us: ‘I got all the way here. I’m starting from the bottom with education, and I’m going to get there. ’’u2009” As they settled into the semester, they monitored everything Trump and his close allies were saying about immigration, their moods shifting with each utterance. Back in December, they felt hopeful when Trump, in his interview as Time Magazine’s Person of the Year, said approving things about Dreamers and indicated that he would deport serious criminals before other undocumented immigrants. They were discouraged in January when Jeff Sessions, in his confirmation hearing to become attorney general, appeared unconcerned about the consequences of revoking DACA. They took heart two days later when Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House, said in a CNN   meeting that he wanted Congress to pass legislation making Dreamers “right with the law. ” Indira and other Georgia scholars were exhilarated in early January when a state court ordered the Board of Regents to allow DACA holders to pay   tuition. But their hopes collapsed when a state appeals court stayed the decision Trump appeared likely to revoke DACA before Georgia Dreamers could reap the benefits. “I said: ‘I don’t know what’ll happen next, but we’re here in this place, and the only way we can win is to succeed in our education,’’u2009” Indira told me. Soon after classes started, the opportunity scholars learned that their collective grade point average for the first semester was a 3. 76. Six of the 34 students had achieved a perfect 4. 0. Indira was one of them. “Succeeding for me is how I can get my revenge,” she told me over the phone, interrupting her biology homework for a few minutes. “I want to break the stereotype of us being here taking jobs away and not helping the economy. I want Trump to see we’re the total opposite of what he thinks. ”"

Two green-dream fantasies are heading for a massive and costly collision.



Firstly they dream of generating all grid power from wind/solar propped up by battery storage (such as lots of giant Tesla batteries and pumped hydro).



Secondly, they dream of replacing all petrol/diesel/gas cars, trucks and buses with electric vehicles, powered by more batteries.



But wind farms do well if they can average about 35% of their rated capacity with low predictability, while solar panels average just 25% of their capacity, produced intermittently. To generate zero-emissions energy for Australia, we would need hills covered with turbines, flats covered with solar panels, the countryside spider-webbed with access roads and transmission lines, and much more hydro.



To stabilise a green energy system without using hydrocarbons will require an eye-watering quantity of batteries, costing as much as 200 times the cost of any wind/solar facility needing backup. Every home will need a battery in the basement (and sensible ones will also have a diesel in the shed).



Add to this battery bonanza millions of batteries will be needed to electrify and replace our fleet of petrol/diesel vehicles.



No wonder cynical mining companies like BHP are going green – they smell a jackpot from the coming green boom in demand for steel, aluminium, lithium, copper, nickel, graphite, cobalt, rare earths and nuclear fuels. And no wonder Tesla supports green energy – the total annual output of the world’s biggest battery factory in Nevada would store less than five minutes of annual US electricity demand. And they also see booming demand for electric vehicle batteries. No wonder Tesla shares have gone ballistic (the boom before the crash?).



The carbon dioxide emitted by all the extra mining, transport, manufacture and disposal of green energy generators and batteries would far exceed the CO2 allegedly saved by the threatened green upheaval.



All Australians rely on trucks to deliver their daily food to towns and cities – in road trains, semi-trailers, refrigerated trucks and electric trains, almost all powered by diesel, coal or gas. If they were all-electric and powered by batteries, where will the electricity come from to recharge all of these batteries? In tomorrow’s Australia, it must come from an unreliable wind/solar grid, hydro power or diesel generators.



Take a look at the video below of a road train taking cattle to market in the Kimberley region in outback Australia. One truck on its own would bog in the soft sand or in creek crossings, but with a 4WD tractor, four diesel semis and eight trailers linked in a road train, at least one set of driving wheels is likely to be on solid ground. In the electric vehicle fantasy-world, what weight of batteries would drive this road train and where would they recharge their batteries?



  
Even if they just focus on forcing electrification of private cars where does the real power come from every night when most of them plug in to re-charge? If it is a still night, ZERO electricity will be coming from wind and solar. That leaves coal, gas, batteries, pumped-hydro, rationing, load-shedding or blackouts to close the gap.



Forget energy-wasting nonsense like capture and burial of CO2, and the energy-consuming roundabout of generating and then burning hydrogen. The zero-emissions delusion is impossible without nuclear power, but this can only happen if people can be reassured on nuclear safety and waste disposal. Are the Greens going to lead that education process?



And if we get global cooling instead of global warming, what will keep us warm on long still winter nights? Any state or country reaching for these impossible green dreams is destined for blackouts and energy riots on the streets.



It’s time for Australian politicians to stop frolicking with green fairies around the zero-emissions maypole. Green energy will never power a conversion to electric vehicles. They must remove all barriers and climate taxes on safe, reliable, trusted energy sources – coal, gas and oil.



We need **more** reliable cheap power for jobs and industry and **more** CO2 in the atmosphere to make green plants grow faster with less water.

"Climate demonstrations are due to take place across the UK this weekend, as the environmental campaign group Extinction Rebellion launches its latest “uprising”. This weekend’s events will include a “funeral march” in Lewes, East Sussex, to “mark the death and destruction wrought by humans on our natural world”. The march, described as a Procession for the Planet, will include mourners dressed in black and a jazz band.  Extinction Rebellion family protest groups will also host “Feed-in and Play-in” events outside the Bank of England, and in locations across Oxford, Cardiff, Leicester and York. The events are in protest against bailouts for fossil fuel companies. In Brighton, activists are due to embark on an “epic voyage of rebellion”, in which they will march from the seafront to London with a lightship – a land-based warning boat – named after the young climate activist Greta Thunberg. The organisation said that this weekend’s events were a precursor to larger protests next week, beginning on Tuesday, in which activists would block streets in London, Manchester and Cardiff as they call on MPs support their proposed climate and ecological emergency bill. The group is focusing its efforts on UK airports, attempting to prevent the aviation industry from returning to “business as usual” after the coronavirus pandemic, during which air travel reduced dramatically because of the lockdown. Activists will gather around Stansted, Luton and Leeds Bradford airports to protest against planned expansions. “The pandemic has shown us how vulnerable we are on a finite planet and we’re being told the coronavirus recovery might be the last, best chance we have to make the radical change needed, but the government is refusing to kick its addiction to the fossil fuel economy,” a spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion said. “Many of us feel a desperate need to put pressure on them now, not wait until next year when the world has been pulled back to business as usual.” A statement on the group’s website said: “There should be no going back to the industries that are causing the most damage in this climate and ecological crisis. “This is a sector which needs to drastically reduce emissions to reduce its huge impact on the climate crisis, yet governments are sending a very different signal by allowing increasing flight numbers, runway expansions and no-strings-attached airline bailouts.” Last year, Extinction Rebellion was banned from demonstrating in London after more than 1,600 people were arrested during 10 days of climate action. However, the high court later ruled that the Metropolitan police decision to impose the ban was unlawful. • This article was amended on 31 August 2020 to clarify that the police decision to ban Extinction Rebellion protests in London was later ruled to have been unlawful."
"As an interesting fact on solar, I had a quote done for my house in Florida for a 2.5kw array (not enough to power the whole house, about 1/3 of the average requirement).  The cost benefit worked out as follows:
Cost to purchase and install:  $25,000 –  this yielded a return of less than 1% on investment (about 0.7%)
Federal tax credit of $7,500
State rebate of about $9,600
Yield after subsidies (if qualified) – a total net cost of $7,900 with a return on my investment of just over 6%.
In other words the state and federal governments (taxpayers) would pay $17,100 in subsidies to support an overall yield on the total investment (theirs and mine) of 0.7%.
Every scrap of the product installed is of foreign manufacture sending the bulk of the taxpayer money overseas.
As a business person, if my company invested in 0.7% return projects, I would be out of business.  I wonder if that applies to the Feds and States?

"With one dramatic no, a major artist has just escalated the culture world’s war against Donald J. Trump. For more than 20 years, the artist Christo has worked tirelessly and spent $15 million of his own money to create a vast public artwork in Colorado that would draw thousands of tourists and rival the ambition of “The Gates,” the saffron transformation of Central Park that made him and   his collaborator and wife, two of the most   artists of their generation. But Christo said this week that he had decided to walk away from the Colorado project  —   a silvery canopy suspended temporarily over 42 miles of the Arkansas River  —   because the terrain, federally owned, has a new landlord he refuses to have anything to do with: President Trump. His decision is by far the most visible  —   and costly  —   protest of the new administration from within the art world, whose dependence on   and sometimes politically conservative collectors has tended to inhibit galleries, museums and artists from the kind of   public disavowal of Mr. Trump expressed by some other segments of the creative world. Last week, the artist Richard Prince fired an opening salvo, returning a $36, 000 payment for an artwork depicting Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter, owned by her family. The Christo project, titled “Over the River,” conceived with his wife, who died in 2009, has been fiercely opposed in state and federal court by a group of Coloradans who contend that it will endanger wildlife and cause other problems in Bighorn Sheep Canyon. Almost six miles of fabric panels were to be erected over the river for two weeks, at a cost that could have exceeded $50 million. Christo, who sells artwork depicting his proposed projects to pay for them completely on his own, has prevailed in every court battle and is awaiting a decision by a federal appeals court that would represent a final stand by opponents. But in an interview on Tuesday, he said that even if he won the case, he would no longer go forward with the work. “I came from a Communist country,” said Christo, 81, who was born Christo Vladimirov Javacheff in Bulgaria and moved to New York with   in 1964, becoming an American citizen in 1973. “I use my own money and my own work and my own plans because I like to be totally free. And here now, the federal government is our landlord. They own the land. I can’t do a project that benefits this landlord. ” Asked to elaborate on his views of the new president, he said only, “The decision speaks for itself. ” He added, “My decision process was that, like many others, I never believed that Trump would be elected. ” The establishment art world is slowly beginning to become more vocal about Mr. Trump, invoking the power of past protest movements, like the Art Workers Coalition, whose Moratorium of Art to End the War in Vietnam pressured museums to close for a day in October 1969, and led the next year to an Art Strike Against Racism, War and Oppression, which drew picketers to the Metropolitan Museum of Art because it declined to shut its doors. In late November, more than 150 prominent artists, curators and gallery workers picketed in front of the Puck Building in Downtown Manhattan, owned by the family of Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump’s husband and now a senior adviser to President Trump. Under the banner of a continuing   and protest movement called Dear Ivanka, critics of the President have directed almost daily condemnations of his actions and policies to his daughter, a prominent art collector. And on Inauguration Day, dozens of galleries  —   and a few public art institutions  —   closed in cities across the country as a part of a movement, J20, that plans to broaden protest activities in the coming months to address issues like racism, immigration and gentrification. Aesthetic refusal as a form of protest does not have universal support in the art world. Some see it as ineffective, a defeatist position that denies the power of expression itself to effect change. “I would argue that this project, on a river that traverses both red and blue states, could draw attention to the importance of federal land management and stewardship of the environment,” said Tom Eccles, the executive director of the Center for Curatorial Studies at Bard College and former director of the Public Art Fund in New York. “If anything, Christo’s projects promote a sense of collective wonder, something we need more than ever right now. ” Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for the White House, said it had no comment. Christo, whose work usually involves monumental wrapping or draping, a kind of beautifying abstraction of architecture or landscape, is known not only for “The Gates,” but also for highly visible projects like “Wrapped Reichstag,” in Berlin, realized in 1995 after more than 20 years of planning and proposals. Last year, “The Floating Piers,” a   walkway of fabric atop 220, 000 interlocking polyethylene cubes on Lake Iseo in the Lombardy region of Italy, drew 1. 2 million visitors. The Colorado project would have been the largest work Christo had ever attempted in America. In interviews, he spoke about how the idea came about in 1985, during a project in which he and   had wrapped the Pont Neuf in Paris. “We looked up at the fabric, and it was so beautiful, silvery and shimmering in the reflected light of the river, and we smiled at each other,” he said. The two inspected dozens of rivers and selected a length of the Arkansas, partly because it was a popular rafting spot, and the canopied fabric, stretched over steel wire cables anchored on the banks, would be best seen from beneath, on the water itself. The project, expected to take more than two years to construct, was to remain in place for two weeks, during an August, before, like all of Christo and  ’s projects, being dismantled. In court, Christo argued that he had taken every step possible to prevent   damage to the river, land around it, or animal or plant life. The group that has opposed him, Rags Over the Arkansas River, or ROAR, has argued that the federal Bureau of Land Management, in approving the project, failed to take sufficiently into account its possible threat to bighorn sheep and the impact on traffic on U. S. Highway 50 through the canyon. On Wednesday, Joan Anzelmo, a spokeswoman for ROAR, said it was “ecstatic” to hear of the decision, no matter what the artist’s reasons. “This means local people will now be protected,” she said, “as well as wildlife, birds and fish. ” In the interview on Tuesday, Christo said the   patience required in seeking approval for his projects has always been an element of the spirit of the projects themselves. He needs to feel passion about them, in the same way that a more traditional painter or sculptor does, he added. But in this case, “that pleasure is gone” because of the nature of the new administration. “I am not excited about the project anymore,” he said. “Why should I spend more money on something I don’t want to do?”"
"Civil liberty experts have warned that peaceful protest is under threat in the UK, after the environmental campaigners were targeted with pre-emptive arrest and “unworkable restrictions” were placed on this week’s Extinction Rebellion (XR) demonstrations. Thousands of people have taken to the streets this week to highlight the escalating climate emergency and demand urgent action from the government. More than 200 campaigners have so far been arrested. The civil liberties group Liberty said legitimate protest was being hampered by forceful police tactics. “Despite the fact the police have a duty to facilitate protest, recent weeks have seen unworkable restrictions, fines and arrests all used to deter us from exercising our rights,” said Gracie Bradley, the group’s interim director. “These restrictions are heavy-handed and go too far.” The Metropolitan police has issued restrictions under section 14 of the Public Order Act that state the XR demonstration in Westminster must take place within the off-road area of Parliament Square between 8am and 7pm. Protesters said it was an attempt to stifle legitimate protest amid government inaction over the climate emergency. “I think [the police] are a lot more stringent, and much more feisty this time round … It’s very, very different,” said Alice Huntington, a 48-year-old protester from Bedford. “I think it’s disgraceful, it remains to be seen whether this is legal really, but it’s bordering on oppression. We have a legal right to protest, and it feels as though that’s not being allowed.” Roger Lockey, 65, said he felt the police had ramped up their actions for each of the group’s rebellions over the past two years. “The response is much more robust than in October, they are not spending much time allowing us to block roads but we didn’t expect it to be the same,” he said. Last week five climate activists from the newly formed Beyond Politics group were arrested and charged with conspiracy to cause criminal damage. An XR co-founder, Roger Hallam, was among them and he and another activist, Diana Warner, remain in prison on remand. Bradley said: “These tactics are not new but they are damaging as they undermine our right to protest by reframing it as a public nuisance. Peaceful protest is a core pillar of any healthy democracy, and it is vital it is protected whatever the cause.” The Met declined to comment but directed the Guardian to its website where a statement said the restrictions had been imposed as the protest could “result in serious disruption to the life of the community”. This week’s demonstrations are the first mass gathering of XR activists since a rebellion planned for earlier this year was cancelled because of the coronavirus pandemic. The group has been warned it could face a £10,000 fine for organising a gathering of more than 30 people under Covid legislation. In London, XR’s latest rebellion has so far focused on Westminster but activists say they intend to target other institutions responsible for the climate crisis in the days ahead. On Thursday, several protesters in the centre of the capital glued their hands to the pavement in an attempt to block two entrances to parliament, before being removed and arrested by police. Nearby, a group of eight Animal Rebellion demonstrators stopped traffic outside the Department of Health and Social Care, blocking the road with a slaughterhouse truck to raise awareness of the link between animal farming and the climate crisis, as well as the risk of pandemics. “We don’t want to upset people going to work, going about their business, especially with the tough times because of Covid, so we are targeting the main areas of government and organisations we feel are most to blame,” said XR activist Tim Grigg.

"**China has warned the US it could take ""firm counter-measures"" if Washington continues to show support for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.**
The warning came after US President Donald Trump signed the Human Rights and Democracy Act into law.
The act mandates an annual review, to check if Hong Kong has enough autonomy to justify special status with the US.
Mr Trump is currently seeking a deal with China, in order to end a trade war between the two countries.
""The US has been disregarding facts and distorting truth,"" a Chinese foreign ministry statement said.
""It openly backed violent criminals who rampantly smashed facilities, set fire, assaulted innocent civilians, trampled on the rule of law, and jeopardised social order.""
The ministry threatened ""counter measures"" if the US continued ""going down the wrong path"".
The new law requires Washington to monitor Beijing's actions in Hong Kong. The US could revoke the special trading status it has granted the territory if China undermines the city's rights and freedoms.
Among other things, Hong Kong's special status means it is not affected by US sanctions or tariffs placed on the mainland.
The bill also says the US should allow Hong Kong residents to obtain US visas if they have been arrested for being part of non-violent protests.
Analysts say the move could complicate negotiations between China and America to end their trade war.
China's foreign ministry summoned the US ambassador to demand that Washington stops interfering in Chinese internal affairs.
Hong Kong's government also reacted, saying the American bill would send the wrong signal and would not help to ease the situation.
But a key activist in the Hong Kong protest movement, Joshua Wong, said the US law was a ""remarkable achievement"" for ""all Hongkongers"".
The bill was introduced in June in the early stages of the protests in Hong Kong, and was overwhelmingly approved by the House of Representatives last month.
Mr Trump said he signed it ""out of respect for President Xi [Jinping], China, and the people of Hong Kong"".
He had previously been non-committal, saying he was ""with"" Hong Kong but also that Mr Xi was ""an incredible guy"".
However, the bill had widespread congressional support, which meant that even if he vetoed it, lawmakers could potentially have voted to overturn his decision.
The president also signed a second bill, which bans the export of crowd-control munitions to the police in Hong Kong - including tear gas, rubber bullets and stun guns.
""[The bills] are being enacted in the hope that leaders and representatives of China and Hong Kong will be able to amicably settle their differences, leading to long-term peace and prosperity for all,"" Mr Trump said.
The US move comes amid a lull in protests following a pro-democracy landslide in local elections.
Hong Kong's protests started in June against a proposed law to allow extradition to mainland China but it has since transformed into a larger pro-democracy movement.
The protests have also seen increasingly violent clashes, with police being attacked, and officers firing live bullets.
Protesters have thrown petrol bombs and attacked businesses seen as being pro-Beijing.
The protesters, meanwhile, have accused police of brutality.
On Sunday, Hong Kong held local council elections that were seen as a barometer of public opinion towards the government and the protesters.
The elections saw a landslide victory for the pro-democracy movement, with 17 of the 18 councils now controlled by pro-democracy councillors.
On Thursday, authorities moved into the Polytechnic University days after it had been the site of a fierce standoff between student activists and riot police.
The police said they had found hundreds of petrol bombs and other home-made devices, and were dusting them for fingerprints.
A search found no remaining activists at the site but it is thought there could still be about a dozen people still hiding inside."
"She had us at the hat toss. Mary Richards was a modest Midwestern girl, to be sure, but she had style, and she had spunk, as her new boss, Lou Grant, pointed out the day she walked into the   newsroom in her white   boots, a pleated miniskirt and those impeccable manners. When she threw her tam in the air during the show’s opening credits, we knew she was thrilled to be single and on her own in the big city of Minneapolis. But as the series unfolded, and we watched Mary Tyler Moore’s most famous character dress for work in the uniform of career women all over the country  —   the clingy knit dresses, the matching   pantsuits, the Evan Picone separates  —   she showed us her heart was in that newsroom. Ms. Moore died on Wednesday in Greenwich, Conn. [ Read Mary Tyler Moore’s obituary | 5 great episodes to stream ] There was a cultural sweet spot in the 1970s, as the old social mores unraveled (along with the “sweater girl”) and women flexed new muscles as working women, divorced women, women commited to the single life, newly conscious women  —   to use the parlance of the   feminist playbook  —   and fashion reflected the fluidity of that time. As women were reinventing themselves, fashion helped them along. Clothing, even in the office, was colorful and personal those jersey dresses and knit pantsuits moved with the body. And they were womanly. Mary’s inherent authority  —   that moral compass  —   was never compromised by the fact that she dressed in the basic idiom of her gender. (By the next decade, that freedom would be snuffed out, and working girls would ape the rigid suits of their male competitors, but that’s another story.) And like all working women, she wore the same outfit more than once, and so her wardrobe became as familiar as our own. Her predecessor, Ann Marie of “That Girl,” played by Marlo Thomas, was our first television singleton, but paired from the   with her boyfriend, Donald. She made her debut in the 1960s, a period that for women on the small screen was still the dark ages. Mary Richards had boyfriends, but they were ancillary to her real life, which played out at work. Looking back at both shows, the clothing displayed the maturation, or the evolution, of the female television avatar. Ann Marie dressed almost like a child in the show’s early episodes, in the cartoonish, youthquake fashions of Mary Quant and others, which Ms. Thomas brought with her from London. The bunny hat notwithstanding, Mary Richards looked like a   . “The Mary Tyler Moore Show” always embraced the real world, and as it unfurled, that world grew a little darker, as did Mary Richards’ clothes. In the final episode, the newsroom is under assault: Ratings are low, and Mary and the gang are fired. But Mary is armored. Clad in a navy blue jumpsuit, like a fighter pilot, her hair cropped to her shoulders, she is strong enough to say goodbye and turn out those lights."

Guest essay by Eric Worrall
According to Quartz, if we don’t address the climate “issue”, everyone in Africa will jump on a boat and set up camp on our front lawns.
The climate-change refugee crisis is only just beginning
The Amhara Plateau is no one’s idea of a gloomy landscape. Rich fields blossom as far as the eye can see; bountiful rivers zigzag through the region’s rolling hills. It isn’t hard to see why local Orthodox Christians believe the Ark of the Covenant was floated down the Nile from Egypt and ended up here. Nor why desert raiders continually stormed in off the nearby Sahara for hundreds of years.
But to those who farm the fertile reaches of Western Ethiopia, their home environment is growing a good deal less enticing by the day.
Erratic temperatures and rains, which culminated last year in the total failure of the belg, the short rainy season, have struck locals hard. In a country still scarred by the deadly famines of the 1980s and 90s, reduced crop yields are panicking villagers, almost all of whom rely on agriculture for their livelihoods.
There’s plenty of evidence that migration in sub-Saharan Africa is partly due to extreme weather.
“The rains are very weak and in winter the cold is like nothing I’ve seen before,” said Barakat Daniel, gesturing at a mostly empty trench he uses to irrigate his teff crop on a muddy hillock just outside Bahir Dar. “It’s a hard life.”
For some ambitious young men, conditions have long since crumbled to intolerable levels. They’ve tired of tilling land that’s become harder to farm as older farmers sub-divide their already small holdings into miniature plots for their many children. With population growth overwhelming meager services at the same time as intense weather plagues farmland, more and more people from the region appear to be following the example of refugees from violence-afflicted parts of Africa, and making a break for Europe.

There are plenty of things wrong with African countries. Anthropogenic CO2 isn’t one of these problems.
According to the Australian CSIRO, according to NASA, the world is greening, thanks to CO2 fertilisation.
Extra CO2 improves plant growth rates, and resistance to drought. So whatever problems these unfortunate people are facing, to date at least, anthropogenic CO2 has incontrovertibly improved the availability of fodder, and boosted food crop yields.
I think it is disgusting that Quartz would attempt to play what is in my opinion a thinly veiled racist narrative, based on what I believe to be a falsehood about the effect of CO2 on arid regions of Africa, to try to get people interested in the climate issue.

"For Donald J. Trump the TV star, ratings were made to be embellished. This turns out to be true as well of Donald J. Trump the president. Mr. Trump spent his first weekend in office at war with math. He said on Saturday that his inauguration crowd  —   which photographs showed was dwarfed by Barack Obama’s estimated 1. 8 million in 2009  —   “looked like a million, a million and a half. ” His staff members backed up that claim with what his adviser Kellyanne Conway memorably termed “alternative facts. ” For the political news media, the brazenness was stunning. But those of us who cover television have seen this kind of thing before: the inventions of a celebrity, surrounded by yes men and women, who creates his own reality. We recognize it because, not so long ago, that celebrity was Donald J. Trump. Mr. Trump has a reputation among TV reporters for using his own bespoke numbers. In 2015, he came to a Television Critics Association panel for his final season hosting “The Celebrity Apprentice” and declared it “the Number 1 show on television. ” It was not. Publicly available Nielsen ratings flatly proved that. Pressed by reporters, he insisted that it was at least the   show on Monday nights. It was not that either. (It finished the season 67th.) It was a bizarre performance even by the usual   standards of the critics association sessions. “The Apprentice” was, in its first season, a genuine hit. It declined afterward, but hung on as a modest performer. That’s no mean feat. But that wasn’t enough for Mr. Trump. So it wasn’t true for Mr. Trump. Last year, Mr. Trump’s former “Apprentice” publicist, Jim Dowd, was interviewed for the PBS “Frontline” election documentary “The Choice. ” Mr. Trump, he recalled, would demand that he call up   reporters and tell them, “Number 1 show on television, won its time slot,” even if “we were Number 72. ” (Mr. Dowd died in September.) Mr. Trump has always used an aspirational calculator. As a real estate developer, he built Trump Tower with 58 stories and declared it 68 stories tall. He carried his scorekeeping obsession into his celebrity career. For his 2011 Comedy Central roast, The Huffington Post reported, writers were told not to joke about Mr. Trump being less wealthy than he says he is. He edited a gag that said he lived in a “   penthouse atop my   space station,” raising the square footage to 50, 000. Running for president meant a new set of ways to keep score, and fudge it: The polls  —   rigged, unless they favored him. His rally attendance  —   huge, yet not too huge for him to embellish. And, again, the TV ratings, and not just for his own events. On Twitter, two weeks before his inauguration, he taunted Arnold Schwarzenegger, his replacement on “The Celebrity Apprentice,” for getting “‘swamped’ (or destroyed) by comparison to the ratings machine, DJT. ” If you knew all this, then you knew, when you saw the expanses of white space on the National Mall on Friday, that Defcon 1 klaxons were going to be blaring in the command center of Mr. Trump’s ego. He would be made small. His crowds would be smaller than Mr. Obama’s  —   smaller than the Women’s March! It would be in pictures, on TV, where things are the most real of all. It would make him look, in his understanding of the world, like a loser. Donald J. Trump is not a loser. Ergo, it was not true. The smaller turnout for Mr. Trump’s inauguration is actually a decent symbol of his election victory, in which he lost the popular vote by nearly three million votes but won the presidency on the strength of an intense base. To put it again in TV terms, Mr. Trump won by   rather than broadcasting. He identified a key demographic in the right markets and successfully targeted it. His margin of victory in the decisive states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin was just over 77, 000 votes combined, around the average audience of the   NBC Universo channel. This is a perfectly valid strategy, in politics and in TV. And in practice, Mr. Trump has embraced the politics of   not just in the campaign but in his inaugural speech, which made no effort to reach beyond his base. But as much as Mr. Trump has adapted to modern media, he is still a    man who came of age in the era of three TV networks, when there were no niche hits. Just as he could not be satisfied with the niche success of “The Apprentice,” he seemingly cannot bear being a niche president. It eats at him. He wants to win total viewers, not just the key demo. He doesn’t want to change to achieve that. But he wants the credit. Thus his repeated lie that he would have won the popular vote if not for “millions” who voted illegally. Thus the   inaugural fans he conjured up like extra floors to sell a condo building. Celebrities have support staff dedicated to maintaining their bubbles. (Even Mr. Trump’s bringing staff members to cheer him at events  —   like his first postelection news conference  —   is familiar from the critics association panels. Journalists are professionally forbidden from applauding the celebrities they cover, so network staffers whoop it up to massage their stars’ egos.) Mr. Trump has his press secretary, Sean Spicer, and Ms. Conway, each playing their version of the bulldog Hollywood publicist. Their job is to keep the talent happy. In a news briefing on Monday, Mr. Spicer essentially argued that the   comparisons were accurate, but it was “demoralizing” for the news media to make them. With these enablers around him, don’t expect Mr. Trump to change much. On Sunday, he   that “31 million people watched the Inauguration, 11 million more than the very good ratings from 4 years ago!” Mr. Trump’s TV ratings were also about 7 million viewers lower than Mr. Obama’s first inaugural in 2009. Mr. Trump’s tendency to treat truth as negotiable was idiosyncratic in a TV star. In a president, it’s disturbing. Alternative facts are what they use in alternatives to democracy. If anything, presidents receive more grades and metrics than candidates do, from approval polls  —   rigged again, apparently  —   to unemployment figures, which Mr. Trump cast doubt on when they were favorable to Mr. Obama. Every sign says that Mr. Trump will respond to these figures exactly as he has in the past: as the TV star, up early in the morning, stewing, waiting for the overnight ratings to come in."

============================================================
Warmer Mediterranean turns the Sahel green
Anthropogenic climate change contributes to fanning of the West African monsoon by moisture from the Mediterranean
Climate change can have mixed consequences: It would appear that the warming of the Mediterranean region, which has brought greater heat and drought to the countries there for around 20 years, is behind an increase in rainfall in the Sahel region. As researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg report in the current edition of the journal Nature Climate Change, due to higher sea temperatures in the Mediterranean more moisture from the eastern Mediterranean is reaching the southern edge of the Sahara at the start of the West African monsoon in June.
Moreover, according to the current study, the future development of precipitation in the Sahel region is crucially dependent on the warming of the Mediterranean.


In the past 20 years, the Sahel has become greener because the West African monsoon brings more rain in the sub-Saharan region. A key reason for this is the strong Mediterranean warming as climate researchers from Hamburg have discovered. © Daniel Triveau / CIFOR (CC-BY-NC-ND 2.0)

Practically no other region in the world has a climate as variable as the Sahel. The climate in the region, which is several hundred kilometres wide, located south of the Sahara, and extends from the Atlantic coast of Senegal to Eritrea on the Red Sea, is dominated by the West African monsoon. This brings rain to the entire region from June to September while drought prevails in winter. The actual cause of this weather phenomenon is the higher position of the sun during the summer months, as a result of which temperatures in these latitudes increase. This has different effects on the land and ocean, however, as water can absorb more heat. “So the land heats up more in summer than the ocean,” says Jürgen Bader, explaining the principle of the monsoon. “Air rises above the warm continent and moisture flows in from the sea as a result.”

The intensity of the monsoon has varied repeatedly over time. Following a relatively wet period in the 1950s and 1960s, the Sahel experienced several periods of severe drought up to the mid-1980s, which claimed over 100,000 lives. Surprisingly, the rainfall increased again after that. Jong-yeon Park, Jürgen Bader and Daniela Matei from the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg have now discovered the main cause of this. “We show that the warming of the Mediterranean – which is due to anthropogenic climate change in part – is the most important factor at work here,” says Daniela Matei. The Mediterranean should therefore also play a crucial role in whether it rains more or less in the Sahel in future.
Warmer seas outside the tropics bring more rainfall 
The intensity of the monsoon in the Sahel generally depends on variations in the warming of the different marine regions. Climate researchers explain the drought of the 1970s and 1980s by the fact that the temperatures in the Atlantic and Indian and Pacific Oceans changed according to a particular pattern. These changes resulted in lower precipitation in the Sahel region.
And different temperatures in different marine regions also explain why there has been more rain again in the Sahel since the 1990s. “The different marine regions ‘fight it out’, so to speak,” explains Jürgen Bader. “If the temperatures of the tropical sea surfaces rise, the precipitation in the Sahel falls. As opposed to this, rising sea surface temperatures outside the tropics result in more rainfall in the Sahel.” As Jong-yeon Park and his supervisors, Daniela Matei and Jürgen Bader, discovered through model calculations carried out for his doctoral thesis, the West African monsoon was more intensive in the past 20 years than in the two preceding decades because the water in the Mediterranean was warmer than that in the tropical marine regions. Thus, the difference in temperature between these marine regions will be a crucial factor in future rainfall development in the Sahel.
Jong-yeon Park used the latest version of the Max Planck Earth System Model MPI-ESM for the calculations. He worked through various scenarios using different simulations. An interesting effect emerged from this process: “If you keep the sea surface temperatures in the Mediterranean constant, the rainfall in the Sahel does not increase,” he reports. In contrast, in other model experiments in which the Mediterranean heated up but the Arctic, North Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans did not, more rain fell in the Sahel region.
The development of the monsoon depends on future sea temperatures 
The researchers can also explain the effect: if the water temperatures in the Mediterranean increase, humidity also increases. It would appear that this increased moisture from the Mediterranean acts as a kind of spark for igniting the West African monsoon: in June it flows over Egypt in the direction of the Sahel. “So there is more precipitation at the beginning of the rainy season,” explains Jürgen Bader. The additional moisture strengthens the convection over the Sahel region. “More air rises which, in turn, intensifies the flow of humid air from the tropical Atlantic,” he adds.
Even if the scientists have now identified the temperature as the decisive factor for the development of the monsoon in the Sahel, whether or not the positive rainfall trend will continue in the future is dependent on the Mediterranean warming up at a higher rate than the tropical oceans. As the Hamburg-based researchers note in their article, more detailed research on the expected development of sea temperatures is needed to forecast this. And this is precisely what they plan to do in further studies.

Share this...FacebookTwitterClimate science critical geologist Dr. Sebastian Lüning and chemist Professor Fritz Vahrenholt informed readers here that a new book has been recently published: “Evidence-Based Climate Science: Data Opposing CO2 Emissions as the Primary Source of Global Warming“.

The book’s publisher is glacier geologist Don Easterbrook, Western Washington University.
At their site Lüning and Vahrenholt write that the emphasis of the peer-reviewed book is on natural cycles, which they say “unfortunately were not adequately accounted for in the IPCC models“.
The book comprises 21 different articles from a groups of authors, among them a paper by geologist Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt which looks at solar cycles. The abstract can be read here (click on Chapter 16).

NTZ contacted Dr. Lüning and asked about what he thinks the results of the book mean and about the status of climate science thus far. Here’s the answer He sent (emphasis added):
We identified a clear mismatch between climate models and paleoclimate data with respect to the role of solar activity changes. This is an issue that needs to be urgently addressed open mindedly by the climate science. Before wide ranging political conclusions are drawn and action taken, obvious model weaknesses need to be seriously addressed and clarified.
Our new paper does not answer this point quantitatively but indicates that there have always been warming and cooling phases in the past 10,000 years which in most cases appear to have run in parallel with solar activity changes. These natural climate and solar changes are of “millennial-scale” with a typical cycle length of 1000-2000 years. A key task is to better understand how much of the warming of the past 120 years is part of this millennial-scale cyclicity and how much is driven by CO2. All facts point at the direction that a sigificant part of the recent warming is actually due to an increase in solar activity whereby the sun has reached some of the strongest intensities of the entire past 10,000 years during this period.
In our paper (Chapter 16) we urge climate modellers to run alternative scenarios which honour the historical climate/solar relationship. Notably, current climate models are not able to reproduce the historical climate cyclicity of the past 10,000 years. With this “hindcast” failure, these models normally would be reliable for future modelling. An increased role of the sun may in the end mean that the warming until 2100 is much less than is currently pognosed, possibly less than 1°C.”

Guest essay by Eric Worrall
Politico reports that Finland’s Ship Building Industry is experiencing a bumper year, as Paris Climate Agreement signatories celebrate the new global environmental accord, by massively ramping up oil and gas exploration and mining in the Arctic.
Finland finds global warming’s upside
The country’s icebreaker business is booming as the shrinking ice cap opens up new opportunities.
HELSINKI — The Arctic is melting at an unprecedented rate, and that’s good news for Finland, the world’s leading supplier of icebreakers.
“You would think we don’t need icebreakers anymore because of the melting ice,” said Stefan Lindström, counselor at the Finnish foreign ministry’s North America unit. “But it’s actually the opposite.”
Ice levels fell to record lows this winter. Some Arctic monitoring stations recorded temperatures that were as much as 9 degrees Celsius above normal. And this year’s maximum ice cover was even less than in 2015, which was also a record-breaking year.
That’s bad news for polar bears and people living on low-lying islands, but the shrinking ice cap is also opening up new opportunities in this Nordic country. Offshore oil and gas drillers, especially from Russia, crude and LNG tankers, cargo ships, research scientists and militaries are pushing north because it’s more accessible due to the melting ice. They all still need icebreakers.
…
Aker Arctic saw its revenues jump 40 percent last year to €14 million after it helped design ice breaking vessels that can carry liquefied natural gas, a technology that will be applied to 15 upcoming vessels. The fleet will service Russia’s $27 billion Yamal Peninsula project, meant to produce 16.5 million tons of LNG per year at full capacity.

If this rise in activity is because of the Paris Agreement, imagine the boost to the Artic Petroleum Industry which the next climate agreement will provide.

"At last the tide seems to be turning. Businesses and consumers are coming to realize that the whole Emissions Industry is designed to deliver money and power to the government. There is nothing in it for taxpayers, consumers or the climate. Even some in the media are becoming sceptics.
For a year now, almost no media was interested in our story. But recently we have had TV, radio and newspaper reporters seeking comment from the Carbon Sense Coalition, and often the interviewers were friendly or at least open minded.
A few other developments.
1. John Coleman, the weatherman who started “The Weather Channel,” has become one of the most prolific opponents to the theory of man-made global warming.  Here he reports how the whole thing started… http://www.kusi.com/weather/colemanscorner/38574742.html
2. Here is a petition you should sign. Go to: http://listentous.org.au/
Dr Dennis Jensen MP will be presenting the petition to the House of Representatives.
3. And Australia has its Climate Sceptics Party. See: http://www.climatesceptics.com.au/
4. Professor Ian Plimer has a new book: “Heaven and Earth”:

5. Another Australian, David Archibald has released a very informative book on the solar links to world climate changes: “Solar Cycle 24”. See: http://www.davidarchibald.info/
6. Last but not least, The Lavoisier Society has released Thank God for Carbon, the latest booklet by Ray Evans. See:  http://www.lavoisier.com.au/articles/climate-policy/science-and-policy/TGFC-Overview.php. You may order copies of the book by e-mail from the Society order@lavoisier.com.au. Please include your name and postal address and the number of copies you would like to receive. The Lavoisier Group would be grateful to receive donations to cover postage and printing costs.
This is a critical year in the battle for Carbon Sense. All over the world the Warmists are becoming desperate as skepticism grows and voters are diverted to real problems like jobs and financial security.
Any help you can give us in this battle of our times is appreciated.

Share this...FacebookTwitter2016 is coming to a close, and I’d like to wish all readers here a very Merry Christmas and all the best for the coming new year.
What follows are some of the main highlights at NTZ in 2016. Overall visitor traffic increased a good 30% since the start of the year. Much of this is due to the hard work of Kenneth Richard who joined as a guest author some months ago.
Kenneth writes every Monday and Thursday. His reviews of the latest scientific literature have gotten great attention. Thanks Kenneth!
2016 Highlights
January: stable Antarctic, GISS’s shady role
Back in January I reported how Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt wrote about how NASA GISS director Gavin Schmidt had “squandered much credibility” and played “a shady role with the temperature data.” The two German experts went on to say that Schmidt’s “dubious data alterations with the GISS datasets will likely become interesting material for science historians.”
Also we reported how Lüning wrote of 5 very recent papers showing that Antarctic ice is much more stable than originally believed.
February: 250 papers disputing climate alarmism
In February Kenneth Richard made his debut at NTZ, providing a list of over 250 peer-reviewed scientific papers from 2015 casting doubt on climate science! The entire list is here.
Also it was underscored what a folly Germany offshore wind energy truly is. A study we reported on shows that the maintenance costs are 100 times more than the cost of the turbine itself. Little wonder Germans are now forced to pay among the highest electricity rates in the world. Technical problems have plagued the German offshore wind industry, read more here.
March: Glacier retreat, sea level rise slow down
In March we presented new papers showing that glacier retreat and sea level rise are slowing down rapidly. Also read here and here. Claims of rapid sea level rise lost credibility as recent studies indicate only 0.8 – 1.6 mm/year sea level rise.
Moreover, Kenneth Richard published a story here on 500 peer-reviewed papers disputing alarmist claims surrounding climate from the year 2014 and 2015. Looks like the IPCC has got a lot of updating to do.
April: Embryonic, untrustworthy models
We’ve known a long time that climate models are woefully inadequate for making reliable long-term projections, and this was confirmed in a story we wrote on a paper appearing in Nature, where a world-class modeler admitted that models are only at the embryonic stage and are hardly trustworthy.
In April a hurricane and winter 2016/17 forecast was issued by David Dilley of  Global Weather Oscillations. So far it looks to be impressively right on the money! Dilley also projects a harsh cold period from 2025 to 2060.
May: MWP global; CERN confirms Svensmark
We saw that the Medieval Warm Period was also prominent in the southern hemisphere and not just a local north Atlantic phenomenon that alarmist scientists insist it was. Also results from CERN confirm the Svensmark theory. More here as well.
The sheer hypocrisy of Hollywood stars was exposed once again as Leonardo DiCaprio jet-set across the Atlantic, burning some 30,000 liters of kerosene – all to pick up an environmental award! Also read here and here.
We reported here how retired German climate scientist Prof. Dr. Horst-Joachim Lüdecke announced there is no detectable human fingerprint to be found in today’s climate change — and he called the science “a dangerous ideology“. Dutch geologist Gerrit van der Lingen even called it “a mass hysteria” and that historians will one day “shake their heads in disbelief“.
June: PIK warns of mini ice age! Faulty models
The ultra-alarmist PIK Potsdam Institute released a shocker, warning of a mini ice age — due to solar activity!
Kenneth Richard then published a list of 50 papers showing that CO2 climate sensitivity is seriously overstated. He also published a list of 21 papers showing that the models aren’t working very well.
July: NASA “data fraud”; ruthless wind industry
In July Tony Heller presented NASA’s climate data fraud and how the trends are “manipulated and fake”. So far the video has been viewed at YouTube close to 24,000 times.
In July we presented just how ruthless the wind industry can be, where it is suspected they destroyed a stork’s nest to clear the way for wind turbines. This shocked environmentalists.
Central Europe’s summer was hardly balmy this year, as a rare snow fell down to 1500 meters elevation in the middle of the summer.
The flood of skeptic papers grew in volume, Kenneth Richard wrote. Already just in the first half of 2016 some 240 papers casting doubt over climate alarmism were published.

August: No sea level rise signal; oceans drive climate
Again many new papers surfaced, obliterating the notion that the climate system is rushing to disaster. With this in mind it is truly unbelievable that a number of attorneys general attempted to silence skeptics using the brute force of the racketeering influenced corrupt organizations (RICO) act.
NTZ presented 4 new papers showing there’s been no detectable sea level rise signal. For example the paper by Hansen et al wrote: “Thus, we found that there is (yet) no observable sea-level effect of anthropogenic global warming in the world’s best recorded region.”
Later Kenneth Richard wrote there is no relationship between CO2 and temperature over 150 of the last 165 years. He also found 35 new papers showing that the sun and the oceans are the main climate drivers.
Even one of the globe’s leading warmist climatologists, Prof. Mojib Latif, conceded that natural oceanic cycles are directly related to tropospheric temperature.
Kenneth also posted a list of dozens of papers showing that “global warming is a made-up concept” and that sea level rise is in fact inversely proportional to CO2.
September: Hockey stick smashed; no cyclone energy trend!
Kenneth presented some 50 scientific publications refuting modern global warming claims. It is becoming increasingly obvious that rapid global warming is merely an artefact of statistical manipulations — all designed to mislead policymakers.
And when it comes to cyclones, atmospheric research scientist Dr. Philip Klotzbach confirmed he sees no link between accumulated cyclone energy and global warming over the past 30 years.
Moreover a new paper was published and shows that co2-influence on the greenhouse effect since 1992 has been imperceptible.
October: Broken models; CO2 is good; no consensus
More bad news for modelers appeared when Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Professor Fritz Vahrenholt declared climate models flawed here, claiming that there is no agreement between the models and paleoclimate data.
Kenneth also uncovered 20 scientific papers that tell us something we knew all along: higher CO2 and warmer temperatures boost crop yields. Now what could be so bad about that?
Also Kenneth showed that the scientific community is in fact a long way from consensus“.
Finally NTZ reported how leading leading climate sensitivity scientist Dr. Robert Cess admitted that the IPCC assumptions are erroneous.
November: Stable Arctic, hyped science; sun linked to climate
Despite the slow start in this winter’s Arctic sea ice recovery (weather-related), Kenneth Richard presented a list of scientific publications showing that there has been no significant net change in Arctic sea extent over the past 80 years. Indeed it’s good to keep your eyes on the big picture.
In a presentation, a retired German climate professor declared that climate science is hyped by a sloppy, politically corrupted media.
The sun-climate connection keeps getting stronger, as Kenneth Richard uncovered some 300 scientific publications over the past 3 years confirming the link. Little wonder that a French scientist found the powerful solar link as well, claiming that most of the global warming can be attributed to solar activity.
AND OF COURSE; HOW COULD ANYONE HAVE MISSED THE GREATEST WRENCH BEING THROWN INTO THE GLOBAL WARMING MACHINERY WITH THE SHOCK ELECTION OF DONALD J TRUMP.
December: Stable, frigid Greenland; slow sea level rise
Kenneth Richard reaffirmed the collapse of the now infamous hockey stick. He also showed that Greenland is as stable as ever, much colder today than it was several thousand years ago and that glaciers there are now even more advanced than they were back then.
Kenneth found more very new literature showing that sea level rise is in fact much slower than claimed, and that claims of a one-meter sea level rise by 2100 are “sheer nonsense”.
And with all the inconvenient scientific literature being published lately, and the public’s rejection of the mainstream media and dishonest political parties, the establishment has been forced to contemplate authoritarian counter-measures. Recently in Germany leading (highly misguided) politicians even called for a crackdown on freedom of speech and the formation of a Ministry of Truth.
Summary
With the huge tsunami of NEW papers disputing the claims of rapid, man-made global warming and the shock election of Donald Trump as President, things are looking awfully desperate for the junk-science fuelled climate alarmism industry. We could all but bury it in 2017.
Merry Christmas and a happy and cool new year everybody! -PG

"**Police in Hong Kong have battled pro-democracy protesters with tear gas in some of the most sustained unrest seen in the Chinese territory in weeks.**
Demonstrators - some wearing Santa hats or reindeer horns to mark Christmas Eve - held flashmob rallies in multiple shopping centres, while others took to the streets of a popular tourist area.
Some threw petrol bombs, while police used pepper spray and batons.
Hong Kong has seen six months of anti-government protests.
The protests started in June over a controversial extradition bill, and have now evolved into a broader movement demanding an investigation into police brutality, and democratic reform.
The territory's pro-democracy movement made unprecedented gains in local elections in November, after months of unrest.
Some protesters had called for a series of protests over the Christmas period, and on Christmas Eve thousands descended on the streets of Tsim Sha Tsui and Mong Kok, two busy shopping areas.
Protesters could be seen digging up bricks from the roads and setting up barricades. Police said a bank was also vandalised and set on fire.
The protesters briefly halted their action at midnight (16:00 GMT) to wish everyone, police officers included, a Merry Christmas, the South China Morning Post reports.
However, clashes resumed shortly afterwards.
One 25-year-old protester, Nigel Chan, told Reuters: ""Many Hong Kong people didn't expect this Christmas to be different... but this year the Christmas Eve seems to [have] become the time to fight.""
Another protester, who gave her name as Mary, told the news agency: ""Even though this is a very joyful event and holiday for us, some [protesters] are in jail... we should remind others that our fight has not ended yet.""
A government spokesman accused rioters of disrupting ""social order and citizens' celebrations on Christmas"" with their ""outrageous"" acts.
They started in June against a draft bill that would have allowed extraditions from Hong Kong to mainland China.
Critics feared this could undermine judicial independence and endanger dissidents.
The bill was eventually withdrawn in September, but the protests have continued and escalated.
Hong Kong was a British colony until 1997, after which it was returned to China under the ""one country, two systems"" arrangement.
Under the agreement, Hong Kong is expected to have a high degree of autonomy from mainland China, and residents enjoy more freedoms than those on the mainland."

By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof Fritz Vahrenholt
(German text translated/edited by P Gosselin)

Image: visibleearth.nasa.gov
A huge crack recently formed through the Antarctic Larsen C ice shelf. The German Tagesspiegel here was fair and did not attribute it to climate change:
A huge iceberg threatens to break away from Antarctica
An iceberg twice the size of Saarland threatens to break off the Larsen-C ice shelf. That’s a rare spectacle. […] ‘The crack is probably 160 kilometers long and 300 to 500 meters deep,’ the project-involved scientist Martin 0′Leary told the German Press Agency on Saturday. A direct connection to climate change cannot be ascertained.”

That’s a normal process: Self ice forms, but does not last forever. Time and again cracks form and chunks break off. During the Little Ice Age the shelf ice was more extensive and stable. Before that, during the Medieval Warm Period, the shelf ice melted similarly like today. If one looks at the past 150 years — the global rewarming since the Little Ice Age — then no one wonders that the Antarctic shelf ice retreated 5 meters per day between 1900 and 1930. Over the past fifty years things probably have looked different, as the Antarctic sea water has cooled over the past 50 years. According to Sinclair et al. (2014), the Ross ice shelf has expanded 5%. Apparently the Antarctic sea ice is indeed more stable than previously thought.
A look back over the past 10,000 years yields additional amazing facts. A series of Antarctic shelf ice regions in fact shrank drastically during this time, or even disappeared completely. For example in Solomina et al. (2015):
A number of Antarctic Peninsula ice shelves have also experienced major fluctuations during the Holocene. George VI Ice Shelf was absent between 9.6 ka and 7.7 ka (Smith et al., 2007), Prince Gustav Ice Shelfwas absent between 6.8 and 1.8 ka (O Cofaigh et al., 2014), the Larsen A Ice Shelf was absent at 3.8-1.4 ka (Brachfeld et al., 2003; Balco et al., 2013). In contrast Larsen B and Larsen C Ice Shelves existed throughout the Holocene (Domack et al., 2005; Curry and Pudsey, 2007).
During the Holocene thermal maximum 6000 years ago, the outer edge of the Amery ice shelf was 80 km closer to the coast than it is today, as documented by Hemer & Harris (2003) in Geology. The abstract:
An increase in sea-ice–associated diatom deposition in the upper [=late] part of the Holocene suggests that a major retreat of the Amery Ice Shelf to at least 80 km landward of its present location may have occurred during the mid-Holocene climatic optimum.
With a little interest in climate science, things suddenly appear much better. Efforts need to be made against the suppression of history and to prevent the pre-industrial climate history from becoming forgotten.

"They are the hulking cars that have conquered the world. Spreading from the heartlands of the US to a new generation of eager buyers in China to dominate even the twisting, narrow streets of Europe, the sports utility vehicle, or SUV, has bludgeoned its way to automobile supremacy with a heady mix of convenience and marketing muscle. The rise of the SUV as the world’s pre-eminent car has been so rapid that the consequences of this new status – the altered patterns of urban life, air quality, pedestrian safety, where to park the things – are still coming into focus. But it’s increasingly clear that SUVs’ most profound impact is playing out within the climate crisis, where their surging popularity is producing a vast new source of planet-cooking emissions. Last year, the International Energy Agency made a finding that stunned even its own researchers. SUVs were the second largest cause of the global rise in carbon dioxide emissions over the past decade, eclipsing all shipping, aviation, heavy industry and even trucks, usually the only vehicles to loom larger than them on the road. Each year, SUVs belch out 700 megatonnes of CO2, about the entire output of the UK and Netherlands combined. If all SUV drivers banded together to form their own country, it would rank as the seventh largest emitter in the world. Climate activists may hurl themselves in the path of new oil pipelines and ladle enough guilt on to flying that flygskam, or “flight shame”, has spread from Sweden around the world but a mammoth, and growing, cause of the climate crisis has crept up almost unnoticed around us. “The global rise of SUVs is challenging efforts to reduce emissions,” Fatih Birol, executive director of the IEA, admitted. SUVs raced to a new milestone in 2019, surpassing 40% of all car sales worldwide for the first time. The world’s roads, parking lots and garages now contain more than 200m SUVs, eight times the number from a decade ago. SUVs’ share of car sales in the UK has tripled over the past 10 years, in Germany last year one in three cars sold was an SUV. Combining the weight of an adult rhinoceros and the aerodynamics of a refrigerator, SUVs require more energy to move around than smaller cars and therefore emit more CO2, overshadowing the car industry’s climate gains from fuel efficiency improvements and the nascent electric vehicle market. Emissions analysis commissioned by the Guardian illustrate, for the first time in detail, how much worse for the climate SUVs are than smaller vehicles, and how they have helped transform our cities. In the US, SUVs emit 14% more carbon dioxide than small passenger cars on average, a wider disparity than in the European Union but smaller than China. These differences add up to a hefty toll in emissions – all of the SUVs sold in the US just in 2018 will in a single year emit 3.5m tonnes more in CO2 than if they were smaller cars. Over a 15-year lifetime of the vehicles, the extra pollution is on a par with the entire annual emissions of Norway. Over a 15-year lifespan, the SUVs sold in the US in 2018 will emit 429.5m tonnes of CO2. In China, the emissions will amount to 482m tonnes of CO2, while in the EU the vehicles will expel 129m tonnes of CO2. Combined, these emissions will be three times higher than what the UK emits from all sources in a single year. “To avert the worst of the climate catastrophe, the transport sector needs to be completely decarbonized,” said Sebastian Castellanos, a researcher at the New Urban Mobility Alliance who calculated the emissions. “With the explosion in SUV sales, we are moving even farther away from our goal of decarbonizing the sector.” This global phenomenon has its roots and impetus in the US, where in the 1980s the car industry carved out a new category called the “sport-utility vehicle”, a sort of mash-up between a truck, a minivan and the traditional American family car. After successfully lobbying lawmakers to class these vehicles as light trucks rather than cars, binding SUVs to less stringent fuel efficiency standards, the industry set about slotting them into almost every arena of American life. Once a workhorse that lugged tools around or was used for bumpy off-road driving, the SUV morphed into the default option for families puttering around suburbia and even for people in the cores of densely populated cities. The look and cost of SUVs stretched to suit all tastes – the 1984 Jeep Cherokee, a boxy, spartan offering considered the first SUV, has spawned successors ranging from the compact Kia Sportage to the sporty Mercedes ML. The industry found that American drivers enjoy the lofty seating position of SUVs, as well as the capacity and the comforting feel of security their bulk provides, even if half of all journeys taken in the US are mundane trips of under three miles to run errands rather than high-octane adventures in the Rocky Mountains. For many Americans, SUVs invoke alluring qualities of fortitude and independence. “Pretty much everyone wants one now,” said Stephanie Brinley, principal automotive analyst at IHS Markit. “The family car is now a utility vehicle and not a sedan. Millennials like them, baby boomers like them. Americans like to take all of their stuff with them and automakers figured this out.” Marketing for SUVs is now so broad it no longer seems jarring to see ads of a beefy car-truck zooming around urban streets to take its occupant to a yoga class or to grab a coffee. Ford was so thrilled with its recent relaunch of the Bronco, a model infamous for being driven by OJ Simpson as he was chased by a phalanx of police cars in 1994, that it rolled out an eight-part podcast series in celebration. “Car companies looked at things that people value, such as macho-ness, ruggedness and protection of the family, and leveraged that,” said Harvey Miller, professor and director of the Center for Urban and Regional Analysis at Ohio State University. “These SUVs are named after mountains and other places you’ll never go to. They created a market that pushes our buttons.” As Bloomberg’s Nat Bullard noted in a recent tweet: “We don’t buy cars here. We buy big cars built on truck bodies, and we buy trucks and drive them like cars.” The US is now indisputably an SUV nation, a transformation that has had profound consequences for American cities as well as the global climate.  This new reality is a logical endpoint to a century of lobbying and cajoling by the car industry to turn American city streets from raucous communal areas shared by pedestrians, market stands and early vehicles to mega-highways that slice disproportionately through communities of colour; where jaywalking is a punishable act and where so much space is required for the 95% of the time our cars sit idle that Los Angeles, for example, devotes an area larger than the land mass of Manhattan just for parking. To Miller, SUVs are a monument to a broader American failure that has seen pedestrians and cyclists forsaken for endless miles of road building, with non-car users forced to push what he calls “beg buttons” to pause traffic to enter roads that should be egalitarian public spaces.  SUVs, according to Miller, not only bring a stew of pollution and an element of fear to those attempting to traverse roads on foot or bike, they are fundamentally inefficient. “You are taking a 200lb package, a human, and wrapping it in a 6,000lb shipping container,” he said. “For some reason we think that is a good way to move through a city. If Amazon used that rationale it would be out of business in a week.” Alarm has also been raised over the safety of SUVs, given that during accidents their elevated stature tends to strike pedestrians and cyclists on the upper torso and then crushes them under the wheels. “They are killing machines,” said Miller. “They cause a lot of damage to the global climate, to air quality and to the people they hit. SUVs are terrible for cities and neighborhoods, they serve no purpose there. You don’t need them to run to the store to buy a gallon of milk.” Taming SUV emissions will largely come down to fuel efficiency improvements and a significant shift to electric versions. Firms including Nissan, General Motors and, of course, Tesla have started to roll out electric SUVs, nudging the driving range up to 300 miles without a charge. But the challenge is steep – today, only about one in every 100 vehicles sold in the US is electric, recharging stations are still sparse and the price of oil – and therefore gasoline at the pump – has recently plummeted to record lows. A deeper-rooted reform would involve a reimagining of US towns and cities as places largely without cars, a previously unthinkable scenario before the pandemic emptied streets and saw outdoor diners, skateboarders and strolling couples take their place on the reclaimed tarmac. The crisis of 2020 has given Americans a glimpse of a different sort of urban life, one more readily associated with Amsterdam or Venice, although there is little sign the clamor for SUVs is weakening. “Most Americans can’t imagine anything else other than highways and crappy public transit. It’s all they’ve ever seen,” said Miller. “Now that SUVs are here they are difficult to unwind but if we want sustainable, healthy cities we have to do it.” Europe, with its more embedded culture of walking, cycling and public transport, is now staging something of a backlash against the SUV, with protests held in Germany over the vehicles’ climate impact and calls in the UK, home of the “Chelsea tractor” insult, for a tobacco-style ban on advertising SUVs because they spew out huge volumes of air pollutants that lodge harmful particles in the lungs and can even lead to brain damage. Not so in America, where the era of the SUV is far from threatened. IHS Markit forecasts SUVs will make up half of all US car sales this year for the first time, strengthening further to 54% of sales by 2025. General Motors, Fiat Chrysler and Ford are increasingly now SUV, rather than car, makers. “The dominance of SUVs is only going to stretch,” said Brinley. “We will just see them as the norm.”"
"**A stand-off at a Hong Kong university campus has led to fiery clashes overnight, as hundreds of protesters tried to repel a police advance.**
Large fires broke out at entrances to the Polytechnic University (PolyU), where protesters hurled petrol bombs and shot arrows from behind barricades.
Officers earlier warned they could use live ammunition if protesters did not stop attacking them using such weapons.
Months of anti-government protests have caused turmoil in the city.
The latest violence is some of the worst the semi-autonomous Chinese territory has seen since the movement began.
The police have become targets for radical demonstrators, who accuse them of excessive force.
Demonstrators have been occupying the PolyU for days. Fresh clashes erupted on Sunday, with tear gas and water cannon being met with petrol bombs, bricks and other improvised weapons.
A police media liaison officer was wounded in the leg with an arrow on Sunday.
The protesters occupying the university had been told to leave immediately on Sunday evening but hundreds remained inside.
Sporadic battles continued throughout the night, with police making a push to re-take the campus at about 05:30 local time (21:30 GMT).
They were met with petrol bombs, which started blazes around the campus.
Later, some protesters tried to leave the campus but were met with tear gas and retreated.
""I hereby warn rioters not to use petrol bombs, arrows, cars or any deadly weapons to attack police officers,"" police spokesman Louis Lau said in a statement broadcast via Facebook late on Sunday.
""If they continue such dangerous actions, we would have no choice but to use the minimum force necessary, including live rounds, to fire back.""
Earlier in the stand-off, police fired a live round in response to what they said was a car hurtling towards officers near the university.
**By the BBC's Gabriel Gatehouse in Polytechnic University, at 04:00 Hong Kong time**
It's only the most radical left now - or the bravest, depending on your point of view. About a hundred of them are hunkered down at a junction outside the main entrance. On the other side of the road: an armoured police vehicle, and a water cannon truck.
Every 10 minutes or so, these two sides play a game of cat and mouse. The police fire tear gas and the water cannon advances, squirting noxious blue liquid. The protesters, crouching behind umbrellas, respond with petrol bombs and rocks fired from improvised catapults. The police vehicles retreat. The net result is zero. It's a stalemate. There are several hundred more protesters milling around the campus. Medics treat those who have been hit by tear gas or the blue liquid in the water cannon, which stings on contact with the skin. Others man barricades at the many entrances to this sprawling campus which is now completely surrounded. When the police announced a 22:00 deadline for the protesters to surrender or face the possibility of lethal force a significant number changed out of their black outfits, ditched their masks, and disappeared into the night. Some were arrested but others escaped.
Those who remain seem determined to fight to the end, no matter the risk. ""If I die, remember me,"" one young man said to me. ""Do you believe that could happen?"" I asked. He gave a nervous shrug.
The protests in Hong Kong, which began in June, were triggered by a now-withdrawn plan to allow extradition to mainland China but have since expanded into wider demands for greater democracy and for investigations into the actions of police.
The government recently confirmed the city had entered its first recession for a decade.
In recent days, Hong Kong's university campuses have been the scenes of pitched battles between police and demonstrators.
A police truck on a bridge above the Cross Harbour tunnel, which links Kowloon and Hong Kong island, was set on fire on Sunday and it was forced to retreat by large crowds of protesters hiding behind umbrellas and hurling petrol bombs.
In a statement the university had urged those occupying the campus to leave.
""Universities are venues for advancing knowledge and nurturing talents. Universities are not battlegrounds for political disputes and should not be drawn into violent confrontations,"" it said.
On Saturday, in a move that sparked controversy, Chinese soldiers in shorts and T-shirts took to the streets to help clean up debris and remove barricades.
It was the first time since the protests erupted that Chinese soldiers, who very rarely leave their barracks in Hong Kong, had taken to the streets.
Hong Kong - a British colony until 1997 - is part of China under a model known as ""one country, two systems"".
Under this model, Hong Kong has a high degree of autonomy and people have freedoms unseen in mainland China.
The protests started in June after the government planned to pass a bill that would allow suspects to be extradited to mainland China.
Many feared this bill would undermine the city's freedoms and judicial independence.
The bill was eventually withdrawn but the protests continued, having evolved into a broader revolt against the police, and the way Hong Kong is administered by Beijing."

Share this...FacebookTwitterAccording to the IPCC (2007), changes in climate occur as a consequence of variations in the Earth’s radiation budget (solar energy absorbed by versus leaving the surface).  Changes in the Earth’s radiation budget occur for 3 primary reasons; two of those three reasons involve solar forcing.
IPCC AR4:
“Global climate is determined by the radiation balance of the planet. There are three fundamental ways the Earth’s radiation balance can change, thereby causing a climate change:
(1)  changing the incoming solar radiation (e.g., by changes in the Earth’s orbit or in the Sun itself),
(2)  changing the fraction of solar radiation that is reflected (this fraction is called the albedo – it can be changed, for example, by changes in cloud cover, small particles called aerosols or land cover), and
(3)   altering the longwave energy radiated back to space (e.g., by changes in greenhouse gas concentrations).”
Reason (3) is, of course, the one that gets nearly all the attention from those who wish to characterize climate changes as primarily influenced by — or caused by — human activity.  That’s where the 100 parts per million change in atmospheric CO2 concentration since 1900 comes in.   According to the latest IPCC report, the total amount of radiative forcing attributed to changes in atmospheric CO2 concentrations since 1750 (through 2011) is just 1.8 W m-2.   Again, that’s the total accumulated radiative effect attributed to CO2-forcing of climate changes over the last 260 years.
To put this into context, consider that the total amount of radiative forcing attributed to the +22 parts per million CO2 increase for the 2000-2010 period is claimed to be just 0.2 W m-2 by Feldman and co-authors (2015):
Feldman et al., 2015
“Here we present observationally based evidence of clear-sky CO2 surface radiative forcing that is directly attributable to the increase, between 2000 and 2010, of 22 parts per million atmospheric CO2. … The time series both show statistically significant trends of 0.2 W m−2 per decade (with respective uncertainties of ±0.06 W m−2 per decade and ±0.07 W m−2 per decade)”
Remember that.  CO2 climate-forcing amounts to merely 0.2 W m-2 per decade with a 22 parts per million increase in atmospheric concentration during the first decade of the 21st century, when there was a pause in global warming.
Reason (1) above, which is essentially changes in the Sun itself that affect its direct output, or irradiance (referred to as total solar irradiance, or TSI), is the second-most talked about explanatory reason attributed to climate changes.  This one is controversial.  While there are many scientists who are increasingly concluding that long-term changes in the Sun’s output (as recorded by sunspot variations) are responsible for centennial-scale warming and cooling periods, including the modern warming (see here for references to 18 such papers published in 2016 alone), there are still many doubters who believe such seemingly small changes in the Sun’s irradiance cannot have a significant effect on the Earth’s climate.
So let’s focus on Reason (2) as an explanatory factor for changes in the Earth’s radiation budget.  This one rarely ever gets much attention.  Most casual observers don’t think of clouds as an important factor affecting changes in climate.  But they are – far more influential than CO2 within the longwave greenhouse effect.  The prominent influence of clouds encompasses both Reason (2) and Reason (3), both albedo/shortwave reflectance and longwave (greenhouse) forcing.
As an example of the dominance of clouds in influencing climate relative to CO2 concentration variations, Ramanathan et al. (1989), in their seminal paper (1,300+ citations) on cloud radiative forcing, write:
Ramanathan et al., 1989
“The size of the observed net cloud forcing is about four times as large as the expected value of radiative forcing from a doubling of CO2. The shortwave and longwave components of cloud forcing are about ten times as large as those for a CO2 doubling.”
Even on the RealClimate blog — founded by Michael Mann and Gavin Schmidt (among others) — there is an acknowledgement that the climate influence from changes in cloud cover are far more influential affecting the radiation budget than variations in CO2 (100 W m-2 for clouds versus just 4 W m-2 for doubled [600 ppm] CO2):
RealClimate:
“Of course the range of net infrared forcing caused by changing cloud conditions (~100W/m2) is much greater than that caused by increasing levels of greenhouse gases (e.g. doubling pre-industrial CO2 levels will increase the net forcing by ~4W/m2)”
As mentioned, clouds influence the climate in both the shortwave (reflecting more or less solar radiation back to space depending upon cloud height and coverage) and longwave (via “trapping” heat at the surface, or the greenhouse effect).  Of the two forcing pathways, the shortwave effects of clouds out-radiate the longwave effects of clouds such that increasing cloud cover leads to cooling, whereas decreasing cloud cover leads to warming.
Allan, 2011
“Satellite measurements and numerical forecast model reanalysis data are used to compute an updated estimate of the cloud radiative effect on the global multi-annual mean radiative energy budget of the atmosphere and surface. The cloud radiative cooling effect through reflection of short wave radiation dominates over the long wave heating effect, resulting in a net cooling of the climate system of − 21 Wm−2.”
So the net effect of reducing cloud cover is warming.  And, not coincidentally, there has been a significant reduction in cloud cover on a net global scale since the 1980s which has allowed more solar radiative energy to warm the Earth’s surface (oceans primarily).  This shortwave cloud radiative forcing since the 1980s (approximately 1 to 4 W m-2 per decade on a global scale on average) is several times greater than the alleged CO2 forcing value of just 0.2 W m-2 per decade for the +22 ppm CO2 increase for 2000 to 2010.  In other words, decadal-scale changes in cloud cover maintain a dominant influence on the net radiation budget, easily outclassing CO2 as the primary source of radiative change since the 1980s.

Goode and  Palle´, 2007
“The decrease in the Earth’s reflectance [cloud cover] from 1984 to 2000 suggested by Fig. 4, translates into … an additional global shortwave forcing of 6.8 Wm2. To put that in perspective, the latest IPCC report (IPCC, 2001) argues for a 2.4 Wm2 increase in CO2 longwave forcing since 1850. The temporal variations in the albedo are closely associated with changes in the cloud cover.
McLean, 2014
“The reduction in total cloud cover of 6.8% [between 1984 – 2009] means that 5.4 Wm−2 (6.8% of 79) is no longer being reflected but acts instead as an extra forcing into the atmosphere… To put this [5.4 Wm-2 of solar radiative forcing via cloud cover reduction between 1984-2009] into context, the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report…states that the total anthropogenic radiative forcing for 2011 relative to 1750 is 2.29 Wm−2 for all greenhouse gases and for carbon dioxide alone is 1.68 Wm−2.  The increase in radiative forcing caused by the reduction in total cloud cover over 10 years is therefore more than double the IPCC’s estimated radiative forcing for all greenhouse gases and more than three times greater than the forcing by carbon dioxide alone [from 1750 to present]. … According to the energy balance described by Trenberth et al. (2009), the reduction in total cloud cover accounts for the increase in temperature since 1987, leaving little, if any, of the temperature change to be attributed to other forcings.“
Radiation Budget Changes Are Primarily Caused By Changes In Cloud Cover, Not CO2
Changes in cloud cover do not need to be large to affect change in the radiation budget.  Even if there are no changes in the Sun’s output (solar irradiance), a tiny reduction in cloud cover can still have a significant radiative effect and lead to climatic warming.

Usoskin and Kovaltsov, 2008
“Even a small change in the cloud cover modifies the transparency/absorption/reflectance of the atmosphere and affects the amount of absorbed solar radiation, even with no changes in the solar irradiance. Since the flux of CR [cosmic rays, which influences cloud cover changes] is modulated by the solar magnetic activity, this provides a link between solar variability and climate.”
Cess and Udelhofen, 2003
“As in the prior studies, which were restricted to lower latitudes, there is a significant increase in the TOA outgoing longwave radiation during the period 1985 to 1999 together with an increase in solar (shortwave) radiation absorbed by the climate system. It is suggested that these changes are related to an observed reduction in cloud cover.”
Wielicki et al., 2002
“It is widely assumed that variations in Earth’s radiative energy budget at large time and space scales are small. We present new evidence from a compilation of over two decades of accurate satellite data that the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) tropical radiative energy budget is much more dynamic and variable than previously thought. Results indicate that the radiation budget changes are caused by changes in tropical mean cloudiness.”
Kauppinen et al, 2014
“We will show that changes of relative humidity or low cloud cover explain the major changes in the global mean temperature. We will present the evidence of this argument using the observed relative humidity between years 1970 and 2011 and the observed low cloud cover between years 1983 and 2008. One percent increase in relative humidity or in low cloud cover decreases the temperature by 0.15 °C and 0.11 °C, respectively. In the time periods mentioned before the contribution of the CO2 increase was less than 10% to the total temperature change.”
A recently-published paper even suggests that the explosive increase in anthropogenic CO2 emissions since the early 1990s has had essentially no effect on the overall greenhouse forcing.  Instead, changes in cloud cover explain the variance in the greenhouse effect since the 1990s.  See “New Paper Documents Imperciptible CO2 Influence On The Greenhouse Effect Since 1992“.
Surface Solar Radiation, Modified By Clouds, Explain The 1980s-Present Warming
Again, CO2 forcing is claimed to yield about 0.2 W m-2 of radiative forcing per decade, which is the net forcing associated with an increase of +22 ppm between 2000 and 2010 (Feldman et al., 2015).   In contrast, global-scale surface solar radiation (SSR) since the 1980s, modified by decadal-scale changes cloud cover trends, has been observed (via satellites) to produce a radiative forcing of between 0.8 W m-2 and 6 W m-2 per decade, depending on the start and end points.  In other words, SSR dominates the changes in the radiation budget, with CO2 only a bit player. 
Pinker et al., 2005
“Long-term variations in solar radiation at Earth’s surface (S) can affect our climate, the hydrological cycle, plant photosynthesis, and solar power. Sustained decreases in S [surface solar radiation] have been widely reported from about the year 1960 to 1990. Here we present an estimate of global temporal variations in S by using the longest available satellite record. We observed an overall increase in S [surface solar radiation] from 1983 to 2001 at a rate of 0.16 watts per square meter (0.10%) per year [1.6 W m-2 per decade].”
Herman et al., 2013
“[T]here has been a global net decrease in 340 nm cloud plus aerosol reflectivity [1979-2011]. … Applying a 3.6% cloud reflectivity perturbation to the shortwave energy balance partitioning given by Trenberth et al. (2009) corresponds to an increase of 2.7 W m−2 of solar energy reaching the Earth’s surface and an increase of 1.4% or 2.3 W m−2 absorbed by the surface.”
Wild et al., 2005
“A similar reversal to brightening in the 1990s has been found on a global scale in a recent study that estimates surface solar radiation from satellite data. This indicates that the surface measurements may indeed pick up a largescale signal. The changes in both satellite derived and measured surface insolation data are also in line with changes in global cloudiness provided by the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP), which show an increase until the late 1980s and a decrease thereafter, on the order of 5% from the late 1980s to 2002. A recent reconstruction of planetary albedo based on the earthshine method, which also depends on ISCCP cloud data, reports a similar decrease during the 1990s. Over the period covered so far by BSRN (1992 to 2001), the decrease in earth reflectance corresponds to an increase of 6 W m-2 in absorbed solar radiation by the globe.”
Wang et al., 2012
Atmospheric impacts on climatic variability of surface incident solar radiation
“The Earth’s climate is driven by surface incident solar radiation (Rs). Direct measurements have shown that Rs has undergone significant decadal variations. … By merging direct measurements collected by Global Energy Budget Archive with those derived from SunDu [sunshine duration], we obtained a good coverage of Rs [surface incident solar radiation] over the Northern Hemisphere. From this data, the average increase of Rs [surface incident solar radiation] from 1982 to 2008 is estimated to be 0.87 W m−2 per decade [2.3 W/m-2 total]”
Palle´ et al., 2005
“Traditionally the Earth’s reflectance has been assumed to be roughly constant, but large decadal variability, not reproduced by current climate models, has been reported lately from a variety of sources.   There is a consistent picture among all data sets by which the Earth’s albedo has decreased over the 1985-2000 interval.  The amplitude of this decrease ranges from 2-3 W/m2 to 6-7 W/m2 but any value inside these ranges is highly climatologically significant and implies major changes in the Earth’s radiation budget.”
Ohmura, 2009
Conclusion:  “Global solar irradiance showed a significant fluctuation during the last 90 years. It increased from 1920 to 1940s/1950s, thereafter it decreased toward late 1980s. In early 1990s 75% of the globe indicated the increasing trend of solar irradiance, while the remaining area continued to lose solar radiation. The magnitudes of the variation are estimated at +12 W m 2 [1920-1940s/1950s], – 8 W m 2 [1950s-1980s], and +8 Wm2 [1990-2005], for the first brightening, for the dimming, and the recent brightening periods, respectively.  … During the 15 years from 1990 to 2005 the sunshine duration hours over the five sites increased by 0.4 h/d which corresponds to the decrease in total cloud amount of 4%. The present analysis shows that the increase in 2.5 W m2 in global solar radiation was caused by the reduction of the total cloud amount by 4%.”
3 New Papers Reveal Dominance Of Solar, Cloud Forcing On Climate
The above scientific papers reference a global- or hemispheric-scale surface solar radiation (SSR).  Documentation of regional SSR trends are widely available in the scientific literature. For example,  in Hawaii, Longman et al., (2014) found that a 5-11% per decade reduction in cloud cover led to a 9 to 18 W m-2 per decade increase in SSR over the period 1988-2012.  For Europe, Posselt et al. (2014) found SSR forcing for Europe was 4.35 W m-2 per decade for 1983-2010.   The following three papers document the dominance of solar and cloud forcing on climate for Spain, the Mediterranean, and the Iberian Peninsula respectively since the 1980s.
Sanchez-Lorenzo et al., 2016
“The linear trend in the mean annual series of global solar radiation shows a significant increase since the 1980s of around 10 Wm-2 over the whole 32-year study period. Similar significant increases are observed in the mean seasonal series, with the highest rate of absolute (relative) change during summer (autumn). These results are in line with the widespread increase of global solar radiation, also known as the brightening period, reported at many worldwide observation sites (e.g. Wild, 2009; Sanchez-Lorenzo et al., 2013b). On the other hand, the annual mean diffuse solar radiation series shows a significant decrease during the last three decades, but it is disturbed by strong increases in 1983 and 1991-1992, which might reflect the effects of the El Chichón and Pinatubo volcanic eruptions as a result of enhanced scattering of the aerosols emitted during these large volcanic eruptions. Summarizing, all these results point towards a diminution of clouds and/or aerosols in Spain since the 1980s.”
Kambezidis et al., 2016
“[T]his work investigates the evolution and trends in the surface net short-wave radiation (NSWR, surface solar radiation – reflected) over the Mediterranean Basin during the period 1979 − 2012 using monthly re-analysis datasets from the Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) and aims to shed light on the specific role of clouds on the NSWR trends. The solar dimming/brightening phenomenon is temporally and spatially analyzed over the Mediterranean Basin. The spatially-averaged NSWR over the whole Mediterranean Basin was found to increase in MERRA by +0.36 Wm−2 per decade, with higher rates over the western Mediterranean (+0.82 Wm−2 per decade), and especially during spring (March-April-May; +1.3 Wm−2 per decade). … The increasing trends in NSWR are mostly associated with decreasing ones in cloud optical depth (COD), especially for the low (<700 hPa) clouds. The decreasing COD trends (less opaque clouds and/or decrease in absolute cloudiness) are more pronounced during spring, thus controlling the increasing tendency in NSWR. The NSWR trends for cloudless (clear) skies are influenced by changes in the water-vapor content or even variations in surface albedo to a lesser degree, whereas aerosols are temporally constant in MERRA.”
Calbó et al., 2016
“The present paper describes how the entire series of global solar radiation (1987–2014) and diffuse radiation (1994–2014) were built, including the quality control process. Appropriate corrections to the diffuse component were made when a shadowband was employed to make measurements. Analysis of the series reveals that annual mean global irradiance presents a statistically significant increase of 2.5 W m−2 (1.4 %) decade−1 (1988–2014 period), mainly due to what occurs in summer (5.6 W m−2 decade−1). These results constitute the first assessment of solar radiation trends for the northeastern region of the Iberian Peninsula and are consistent with trends observed in the regional surroundings and also by satellite platforms, in agreement with the global brightening phenomenon. Diffuse radiation has decreased at −1.3 W m−2 (−2 %) decade−1 (1994–2014 period), which is a further indication of the reduced cloudiness and/or aerosol load causing the changes.”

Less than a week before U.N. negotiators convene in South Africa for a new round of talks aimed at forging a global climate pact, a hacker has released an apparent second round of e‐​mails from the University of East Anglia in Britain that seek to portray climate scientists in a negative light.



Now let’s break that sentence down. Could it really be the e‐​mails from the climate catastrophists that “seek to portray [themselves] in a negative light”? Surely not. Rather, it appears that the sentence was intended to read something like this: 



…a hacker believes that the apparent second round of e‐​mails from the University of East Anglia that he released today portray climate scientists in a negative light.



If there’s any embarrassment to the writers of the e‐​mails, after all, surely it was not intended. In any case, it’s not the release of the e‐​mails that might “portray [some] climate scientists in a negative light,” it’s _the e‐​mails themselves_.   
  
  
More on the original Climategate here. Ongoing posts at this climate‐​skeptic website. And as you hear terms like “skeptics,” “deniers,” and so on, remember what Pat Michaels wrote in the 2009 _Cato Handbook for Policymakers_ : 



Leading politicians and media figures are insisting that Congress make   
global warming a very high priority. **Global warming is indeed real, and human activity has been a contributor since 1975.**   
  
  
But global warming is also a very complicated and difficult issue that   
can provoke very unwise policy in response to political pressure. In 2005, for instance, Congress clearly made a very bad decision about climate change when it mandated accelerated production of ethanol. Critics had argued then that corn‐​based ethanol would actually result in increased carbon dioxide emissions. An increasing body of science has since verified this position. Further, corn‐​based ethanol is responsible in part for the skyrocketing price of corn, soybeans, rice, and wheat since the mandates began.   
  
  
Although there are many different legislative proposals for substantial   
reductions in carbon dioxide emissions, **there is no operational or tested suite of technologies that can accomplish the goals of such legislation. Fortunately, and contrary to much of the rhetoric surrounding climate change, there is ample time to develop such technologies** , which will require substantial capital investment by individuals.



He’s a skeptic about the predictions of catastrophic and imminent threats, not about the existence of modest global warming.

You Ought to Have a Look _is a regular feature from the Center for the Study of Science. While this section will feature all of the areas of interest that we are emphasizing, the prominence of the climate issue is driving a tremendous amount of web traffic. Here we post a few of the best in recent days, along with our color commentary._   
  
_\---_   
  
In this _You Ought to Have a Look_ , we hope that some of the “You” are members of, or influencers of, President-elect Trump’s transition teams.   
  
With so much talk about the Trump’s plans on killing the Clean Power Plan, withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement, reversing the Keystone XL pipeline rejection, removing energy subsidies and reigning in the EPA (all good ideas in our opinion), we want to make sure the transition team doesn’t overlook other, invasive, burdensome, costly, and climatologically-meaningless regulations that were put in place in President Obama’s Climate Action Plan.   
  
Here’s a rundown of some of the more significant of them.   
  
**Energy Efficiency Regulations from the Department of Energy.**   
  
The DoE and put forth a seemingly endless string of regulations governing the energy efficiency of all manner of power-consuming appliances large and small, from industrial boilers and refrigeration systems, to microwave ovens, and ceiling fans (and most things in between). The reason?   






We have repeatedly submitted public comments as to why the climate change angle should be a non-starter (our latest in this long line is here). But besides that, the DoE standards result in appliances that work less well, cost more, and reduce consumer choice. Our big brother government thinks it’s doing us all a favor because we aren’t savvy enough to value long-term cost saving from energy consumption over other values. Not everyone agrees. Sofie Miller, senior policy analyst at the George Washington University Regulatory Studies Center, recently wrote:   




This line of reasoning overlooks the possibility that consumers may have legitimate preferences for less-efficient appliances based on household characteristics or other observable product qualities (such as size, durability, reliability, or noise level). Also, the assumptions underpinning the DOE’s analyses may not be accurate; for instance, some consumers may have high discount rates, making future energy savings less important than immediate purchase savings. By regulating away the option for consumers to purchase less efficient appliances, the DOE claims to be improving consumers’ choice structure by removing choices. These rules aren’t technology-forcing, they’re consumer-forcing.   
  
…the fact that consumers choose not to purchase efficient appliances indicates only that they do not value these attributes as much as the DOE does. As a result, these rules impose huge net costs on consumers, rather than benefits.



Yet the DoE has a lot more of these efficiency standard regulations in the offing (the public comment period is currently open for two more proposed regulations—governing walk-in refrigerators and residential furnaces).



One member of Congress, Representative Michael Burgess (R-TX) has previously sponsored legislation aimed at striking “all government-mandated energy efficiency standards currently required on a variety of consumer products found in millions of American homes.”   
  
We suggest that similar efforts—either taking place within the DoE or through Congressional action—be pursued by the incoming Administration.   
  
**Greenhouse Gas Emissions Assessments Required Under the National Environmental Policy Act**   
  
According to the EPA, the National Environmental Policy Act of 1970 (NEPA), directs that:   




“all branches of government give proper consideration to the environment prior to undertaking any major federal action that significantly affects the environment.” 



And that:   




“NEPA requirements are invoked when airports, buildings, military complexes, highways, parkland purchases, and other federal activities are proposed. Environmental Assessments (EAs) and Environmental Impact Statements (EISs), which are assessments of the likelihood of impacts from alternative courses of action, are required from all Federal agencies and are the most visible NEPA requirements.”



Under the Obama Administration, NEPA, which is administered by the Council on Environmental Quality, was modified to include requirements that the greenhouse gas emissions (acting as a proxy for climate change) that may result from all new projects be estimated and that information considered when assessing the feasibility/acceptability of the project.   
  
This is ludicrous, as we explained in our Comment in opposition:   




This aspect of the CEQ guidance is internally inconsistent, contrary to the intentions of NEPA, and ultimately misdirects policymakers and the general public alike.   
  
Additionally, it illustrates a lack of understanding and comprehension of environmental science—yet this guidance is supposedly being developed to provide direction to federal agencies in their reporting of science-based environmental impacts.   
  
Instead, the draft guidance appears to have been created to elevate policy initiatives over actual science. This is inappropriate. In its current form, the guidelines should be rescinded and redeveloped with a more appropriate emphasis on environmental and climate science.   
  
…To best serve policymakers and the general public, the CEQ should state that all but the largest federal actions have an undetectable and inconsequential impact on the environment through changes in the climate. And for the largest federal actions, an analysis of the explicit environmental impacts resulting from greenhouse gas emissions arising from the action should be detailed, with the impacts assessment not limited to climate change but also to include other environmental effects such as impacts on overall vegetative health (including crop yield and production).   
  
As called for in the guidelines described in this current draft—substituting greenhouse gas emissions for climate change and other environmental impacts—is not only insufficient, but is scientifically inadequate and potentially misleading. As such, these CEQ guidelines should be rescinded and discarded.



Obama’s CEQ didn’t favorably consider our objection. We urge Trump’s to reconsider.   
  
**Social Cost of Carbon**   
  
The Obama Administration’s favorite tool to produce monetary justification for its actions on climate change is the social cost of carbon (SCC). The SCC is supposed to be a representation of all the future damages (extending globally out about 300 years(!)) caused by each additional ton of carbon dioxide emissions from human activities, expressed in current dollars. The Administration currently considers that elimination a ton of CO2 that would otherwise be emitted results in a savings of about $40 in future damages. It’s the “climate benefit” of their rulemaking.   
  
But, the SCC is so highly malleable that you can pretty much game it to produce any value desired—the perfect characteristic for an all-purpose economic cost/benefit tool wielded by an opportunistic and activist government.   
  
We’ve described in great detail the hows and whys of the SCC and why the Obama Administration’s determination of it is so badly biased (a recent example is here).   
  
A critical re-examination of the SCC is badly needed (the one conducted a few years back by Obama’s OMB was but a whitewash).   
  
We suggest that the new administration follows the explicit Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidelines in calculating the SCC, including guidance on how to select discount rates, as well as requirements for reporting domestic (vs. global) costs. Additionally, the new SCC determinations should fully incorporate the latest scientific estimates of the sensitivity of the earth’s temperature to carbon dioxide increases and adequately incorporate the overwhelming scientific evidence of the positive effects of carbon dioxide on global food production and vegetation growth. At some higher discount rates (associated with a vibrant economy) and low climate sensitivities the SCC becomes _negative_ , meaning that the emissions are beneficial.   
  
In doing so, the new Administration will find that the value of the SCC will approach zero and even go below in some cases—eliminating the justification for federal actions explicitly directed a reducing carbon dioxide emission from energy use and production.   
  
There are many more Obama climate actions that the Trump Administration should reconsider, but these three, along with the ones explicitly mentioned in Trump’s new transition website, should feature prominently on the list of things to accomplish in the near term.

"There are almost 22,000km² of glacier ice in the Himalaya, the spectacular arc of mountains that stretches from north-west India to south-east China. These glaciers are the source of mighty rivers such as the Ganges, the Indus and the Brahmaputra, which hundreds of millions of people depend on for their daily needs. For scientists, the behaviour of glaciers provides the clearest indication of climatic change in high mountain regions. Recent research has shown that most glaciers in the Himalaya are shrinking, most likely because of long-term increases in temperature. The contribution of glacier meltwater to river flow cannot be sustained over long periods of glacier shrinkage, which means the sustainability of river flow in south-east Asia will soon be at risk.  Over the past few decades, the increasing meltwater yield from glaciers has led to the formation of thousands of new lakes high in the Himalaya, where not all of it drains instantly downstream. These lakes can form directly at the head of retreating glaciers, buffered by big piles of rock debris that the glacier has carried down, called terminal moraines, which signal the glacier has gone as far as it can go. Lakes can also form in large basins hollowed out of the bedrock by a glacier, or even on top of flat, slow-flowing, debris-covered glaciers. The impact of this widespread development of meltwater lakes has never been studied in detail. But now our research shows that the formation of new glacial meltwater lakes over the past few decades is having an amplifying effect on glacier retreat across the Himalaya, driving a recent increase in the loss of ice across the region. To examine glacier behaviour over a similar period to that of the newly formed lakes, we used declassified US Hexagon KH-9 spy satellite images, which captured the state of Himalayan glaciers as early as 1973. Combined with data from the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission in 2000 and data from modern-day satellites, we created three-dimensional models called digital elevation models (DEMs) of the surface of approximately 7,500km² of Himalayan glaciers. By examining the differences in the surface elevation of glaciers at different points in time, we were able to measure how quickly glaciers across the region have thinned over the past five decades. We found that  since the 1970s, glaciers flow down into lakes have thinned at around twice the rate (up to four metres a year since 2000) of glaciers flowing down on to land. We also showed that the difference in the rate of ice loss between glaciers flowing into a lake and on land has widened since 2000. We also looked at how the position of the front of the same glaciers has changed since the 1970s. Again, glaciers that are now flowing into these new meltwater lakes retreated at more than twice the rate (an average of 26 metres per year since 2000) than glaciers flowing on to land (an average of nine metres a year). Since the 1970s glaciers that are now flowing into lakes reduced in length by an average value of 13%, but by as much as 49% in some cases. Glaciers flowing on land reduced in length by an average of 9%. The areas of High Mountain Asia covered in glaciers are warming at a higher rate than the global average. Even under the most conservative Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) RCP2.6 scenario (which explores the possibility of keeping average global temperature increase below 2°C) a 1.5°C increase of global temperatures will cause 2.1°C of warming in High Mountain Asia. Such a rise in air temperatures will ensure continued glacier retreat in the region. While rain may increase in the Himalaya in coming decades, snowfall is not predicted to increase to counter glacier melt.  The continued expansion of current glacial lakes combined with the formation of more new lakes will amplify ice loss levels above that caused by temperature increases. The existence of a glacial lake at the front of a glacier causes enhanced melting when warmer lake water makes contact with the ice, which then produces “calving” – the detachment of large chunks of ice from the front of a glacier.  Further work examining how widespread the right conditions are for further glacial lake formation across the region is vital if we are to understand the different scenarios of glacier evolution high in the Himalaya. The continued monitoring of glacier retreat will provide the clearest indication of the impact of global warming on this unique but fragile region.

"**Shares in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba have surged in its Hong Kong trading debut in one of the year's most anticipated stock offerings.**
The firm, which is already traded in the US, raised around $11.3bn (Â£8.8bn) in its secondary listing.
At the launch, Chairman Daniel Zhang cheered Alibaba's return to Hong Kong.
The move is seen as a boost for the city amid fears long-running protests have tarnished its reputation as a financial hub.
In opening moves on Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index on Tuesday, Alibaba's stock jumped more than 6%.
The company was met with strong appetite for its shares, priced at HK$176 each.
Mr Zhang struck the gong at the ceremony at the city's exchange and welcomed the firm's return ""home"" to Hong Kong.
He was joined by the territory's Financial Secretary Paul Chan and former Hong Kong chief executive Tung Chee-hwa.
The Hangzhou-based firm had originally considered a Hong Kong initial public offering (IPO) in 2013, but opted for New York after failing to secure regulatory approval in the Asian territory.
Over the years, Alibaba has grown from an online marketplace into an e-commerce giant with interests ranging from financial services to artificial intelligence.
Ahead of its Hong Kong debut, the company said the listing would allow investors across Asia to ""participate in Alibaba's growth,"" as it seeks to tap ""substantial new capital pools"" in the region.
The share sale has knocked Uber off the top spot as this year's biggest IPO, according to Dealogic data. The ride-sharing firm raised $8.1bn in its New York float in May.
The move to go ahead with the Hong Kong listing comes after Alibaba delayed plans to do so earlier this year, amid ongoing unrest and the US-China trade war.
The long-running protests have hurt the economy, which has fallen into recession, and knocked business confidence in the city.
The protests started in June against plans to allow extradition to the mainland - which many feared would erode the city's freedoms.
Hong Kong is part of China, but as a former British colony it has some autonomy and people have more rights.
While the extradition plans were withdrawn in September, the demonstrations have continued, with protesters calling for an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality, and democratic reform."

At a recent social gathering, regarding coronavirus, someone ventured to ask, “Why do all these new diseases seem to come from Asia?” It seems a reasonable question: SARS, Nipah virus, Avian flu, Swine flu…historically, too, the bubonic plague is thought to have originated in Mongolia, and cholera in India. But that would be to ignore all the recent outbreaks from places **other** than Asia (Africa especially): Ebola, Marburg virus, Lassa fever, Zika virus, HIV, and so on.



So, what **is** common to all these? Both Africa and Asia are evolutionary hothouses. They are also densely populated. But so is Europe.



Instead, **Matt Ridley** argues, the key is dense populations of humans and live animals living in close proximity. **Especially bats.**



[Coronavirus] is not the first disease bats have given us. Rabies possibly originated in bats. So did, and does, Ebola, outbreaks of which usually trace back to people coming into contact with bat roosts in caves, trees or buildings.



The list continues. Marburg virus, Hendra virus, Nipah virus, Sars, Mers…



Why are bats responsible for so many recent zoonoses (posh Greek for infections acquired from other animal species)? First, bats are mammals, which means they are sufficiently closely related to us for some of their viruses to thrive in our bodies[…]Second, bats have never been domesticated. On the whole we have already caught the diseases of cows and pigs and dogs. 



Third, unlike most other mammals, bats live in huge flocks — just as we do. They therefore host viruses that spread by casual contact



But why are bats suddenly spreading viruses to humans? It’s not like they haven’t been around for a while.



That is easy to answer too. It’s not because of climate change or the destruction of forests. Bats have lived in belfries, as well as dead trees, for centuries. It’s because we now live at such high densities and travel so much. With 7.7 billion people on the planet, many of whom now travel long distances, we are a tempting target[…]The chances are that plenty of people died of bat-borne infections in the past too, but the epidemic usually petered out because villages were small and long-distance travel was rare.



The earliest documented case of what is now known as HIV, dates back to 1959. Genetic studies date its origin to the 1910s. But it took until the early 1980s for it to really take off.



But in the case of coronavirus, it may not be the bat soup that’s to blame, but another of China’s culinary weirdnesses and “traditional medicine” superstitions.



However, it seems bats probably did not give us Covid-19 [coronavirus] directly. The virus’s sequence of RNA (DNA’s cousin) in human beings is 96 per cent the same as that found in a bat sampled in Yunnan in 2013 during the search for the origin of Sars. This implies that they share a common ancestor at least 25 years ago. By contrast, the pangolin version of the virus is 99 per cent similar to ours. Probably, captured pangolins, on sale in the live-animal market in Wuhan and mainly imported from Malaysia, had somehow caught the virus from bats. Pangolins are globally endangered because of demand from China.



[So…] please can we learn two obvious lessons? First, let’s stop bringing wild animals into markets alive (if at all): viruses do not survive long in dead bodies, even if not refrigerated. It’s a cruel practice anyway. And second, let’s keep our distance from bats. Definitely don’t eat them.



So much for the deep-fried Southern Spotted Quoll I was planning on tonight.

"Of all forms of homage, attention to detail is perhaps the most loving. It requires not just knowledge and dedication, but also thoughtfulness. It prizes accuracy both out of respect to the historical record, but also to those who wrote it. It celebrates the vision of the original creators more than the disruptive instincts of reinterpreters. By that measurement, “The New Edition Story,” a vibrant, fiercely committed     that begins Tuesday on BET, is overflowing with love  —   a jubilant celebration of a group that was preternaturally talented and rivetingly tortured. Few groups in modern black pop are as deserving of this treatment as New Edition, which transported the elegance of the male vocal groups of the 1970s into the first wave of RB’s dance with   in the late 1980s. The act released four essential albums, a couple more good ones, and spun off careers for all its members  —   solo work by Bobby Brown, Johnny Gill and Ralph Tresvant, and a group, Bell Biv DeVoe, made up of the others. None of this happened without conflict. New Edition, which hailed largely from the Orchard Park projects in the Roxbury section of Boston, was a black act that was chided by its label for not being mainstream enough. The members squabbled with executives, management and among themselves. This was in many ways the archetype of the modern boy band  —   so much so that when New Edition left Maurice Starr, who produced the group’s early songs, he created New Kids on the Block, essentially a white copy. For all of its musical influence, the group is probably best known for its internal dramas, its contractual nightmares and for the troubled adulthood of Mr. Brown. “The New Edition Story” isn’t hagiography. Friction was integral to the group’s mystique, but the show spends a good deal of time on its earliest days as preteens trying to forge a style. (For this part of the series, the members are played by younger actors. Tyler Williams as Mr. Brown and Jahi Winston as Mr. Tresvant are particularly dynamic). New Edition’s ascent was rapid: “Candy Girl,” the group’s 1983 debut single, went to No. 1 on the Billboard hot black singles chart, and the group had successful hits until the end of the decade. But in this   that stretch of time is depicted as one of turmoil and dissatisfaction. Mr. Tresvant (Algee Smith, tender and limber) carries the disproportionate burdens of the lead singer, earning acclaim and resentment. And of course, there’s Mr. Brown (a combustible Woody McClain) who’s perpetually at war: with the other group members, with management, with law enforcement and, of course, with himself. “The New Edition Story” depicts a group of young men consistently slipping through the fingers of authority figures. That means their mothers (Sandi McCree as Carole Brown and Yvette Nicole Brown as Shirley Bivins are especially intense) their manager and choreographer Brooke Payne, played by Wood Harris, who conveys a   swagger with the tiniest cock of the head or extinguishing of a cigarette and their manager (in this case Gary Evans, a fictional   for the group’s manager in its late 1980s pop heyday) played by a manic Michael Rapaport. “The New Edition Story” is, by far, the best of the recent spate of black pop biopics, miles beyond the shoestring Lifetime entries about Toni Braxton and Aaliyah, films that have contributed to an air of lowered expectations for projects of this nature. Instead, “The New Edition Story”  —   written by Abdul Williams and directed by Chris Robinson  —   is more in keeping with the excellent “Unsung”   about black musicians on TV One. It tells the group’s story, warts and all. (But not all the warts: Many of the details of Mr. Brown’s tumult have been left aside, and certain incidents, such as the      quarrels with the RB group Guy that led to the shooting death of that group’s head of security, didn’t make the cut.) It undoubtedly helps the   that the whole group  —   the original members Mr. Brown, Michael Bivins, Mr. Tresvant, Ricky Bell and Ronnie DeVoe, as well as Mr. Gill, who joined after Mr. Brown’s departure  —   signed on as  . While that might mean some light sugarcoating, it also results in a historical narrative told with impressive detai l, particularly in regards to wardrobe and production design (kudos to the costume designer Rita McGhee). Album covers, dance routines and video shoots are remade down to the tiniest details (the remade videos for “If It Isn’t Love” and Mr. Brown’s “Every Little Step” are impressive). The clothing is a virtuosic symphony of sequined suits, flowing synthetic fabrics, graffitied overalls. And then there’s the music: “The New Edition Story” relies on effective rerecorded versions of the group’s many hits, sung by the actors (and mixed in places with original master recordings.) The music itself is handled by the duos of Babyface and Antonio Dixon, and Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, who’ve rebuilt the New Edition sound (much of which they originally created) with rigor and affection. Approval and faithfulness have limits, though. The group’s founding is streamlined, and some   slang slips into   scenes. Comparatively little time is spent on the group members’ solo efforts, especially given that so much of the final installment focuses on the members’ reconciliation in the   a reassurance that everyone ended up on the same page, putting their individual and collective troubles behind them. (The N. W. A biopic “Straight Outta Compton” took a similar, though more maudlin approach.) Here, some liberties have been taken with the timeline, placing an impromptu reunion at Mr. DeVoe’s wedding, in 2006, before the group’s participation at a BET 25th anniversary show, in 2005, so that the   can effectively end with a   performance and a BET infomercial. This is slick positioning and salesmanship, but also disingenuous. New Edition has been as fascinating for its valleys as its peaks. For this group, the most fitting tribute is always the truth."
"**Nobody saw it coming. Hong Kong's year of protest and violence stunned everyone from observers to participants. What started the crisis was political - but emotion has fuelled it.**
**We picked seven to explain this year of tears, exhilaration, broken relationships and personal pride. Text by the BBC's Grace Tsoi, portrait photographs by Curtis Lo Kwan Long.**
Saturday 30 March 2019 was the last normal day. Clear and sunny, it began like any other weekend in Hong Kong with its singular cocktail of frenetic leisure - family lunches, shopping late into the neon-lit night and cute selfies at every opportunity.
The next day, something more political began. A few thousand people marched through a dispiriting drizzle to protest against a proposal that would have allowed extradition to China: ""With extradition to the mainland, Hong Kong becomes a dark prison,"" they chanted.
It didn't get much coverage then. But the city was listening.
Within six months, Hong Kong was a place of huge protest marches, street battles and an unapologetic police response of tear gas, rubber bullets, water cannon and live fire. Teenagers shot bows and arrows, the parliament chamber was vandalised, hundreds of young people now know how to make Molotov cocktails and start fires. But after the bill was withdrawn, the anger became more palpable if anything.
Politics may have been the trigger, but reckless passion is the fuel and on display everywhere. Arguments have broken out on the street between strangers: one man was set on fire while arguing with anti-government protesters; a taxi driver full of rage ran his car through a group of protesters; a student fell to his death in unexplained circumstances; an elderly cleaner standing in the middle of the road gaping at a fight was hit by a stray brick careening through the air. He died.
It is a difficult thing to report dispassionately on the descent of your home, a city famous for stability, into a surreal dystopian vision. People are worried about China's domination but they are also worried about what violence has done to the fabric of society. It seems as if nobody is sleeping well any more.
The textbook factors of politics, economics, demographics, even democratic ideals, ideology and identity cannot fully explain this - but the emotional intensity generated by the interplay of it all completes the picture.
Even though the politics divides, the emotions are what the city shares - and these stories have helped me understand Hong Kong's fraught predicament.
When Fiona met her husband at school, she knew she would marry him one day. Now, in their late 30s, they have a picture-perfect family with two children. But this is the year everything changed.
She is a protester. He is a policeman.
""I tell him I feel less love for him,"" Fiona says.
They didn't discuss politics when they were dating - there was little politics to discuss then.
It was only during the 2014 Occupy movement, which sought changes to Hong Kong's electoral system, that political differences emerged. She left home for the protest zone one month after she gave birth to their son, but felt wounded by the scorn of her husband.
Despite that, she believed that love could bridge any differences. That's not the case any more and the turning point for her - as for many others in Hong Kong - came on 21 July.
That night had seen protests erupt across the city. But as people headed home late in the evening another element entered the fray. In the rural district of Yuen Long, a large group of white-clad pro-government men, rumoured to be linked to triad gangs and armed with rods and poles, were waiting at the train station. They began beating people they believed to be protesters.
""I rushed out from the toilet with my phone in my hand. I told him the white shirts were beating up ordinary citizens in Yuen Long. He said he knew and went into the bedroom. He slept soundly that night, while I stayed wide awake.""
Outrage swept across Hong Kong and by the following morning there were accusations that the police had not done enough. Their denials were insufficient to prevent Yuen Long being used as proof that the police were not there for the people but for the masters. The next weekend of protest was one of the most violent seen up to that point.
Fiona's anger only grew as police became more heavy-handed. She and her husband began quarrelling over alleged police brutality.
Support for protesters, even as they went further in their violent action, is attested to by opinion polls. Protesters took out their rage on companies seen as pro-government: the MTR train operator saw stations and ticket machines vandalised, Chinese-owned ATMs were destroyed - this in a city famous for its respect for the rule of law. Yet the results of district election last month saw an overwhelming victory for pro-democratic figures.
Fiona's husband, though, was not swayed.
""Why is he so foolish? He thinks there's nothing wrong with the Chinese Communist Party and the extradition bill,"" Fiona says.
And so contempt crept into their relationship.
Her husband, however, still loves her very much. ""He keeps sending me heart emojis. I used to reply to him with a heart but now I don't feel like doing it. And he keeps asking...
""I really want to love him again, but I can't.""
She does acknowledge, though, that ""this is his pride. This is his identity.""
It is an acknowledgement needed by those in Hong Kong who support the police and the government. For them, one of the most unsettling things about Hong Kong's year is not confrontations between police and protesters, but the political fights that erupt on the street.
Just over a month ago Crystal Chu, a 49-year-old businesswoman, arrived at the border station of Sheung Shui at the call of a pro-Beijing group, which planned to stage a protest. About 100 of them were soon outnumbered by pro-democracy protesters.
She was first pelted with eggs and projectiles and then she was hit in the head - she needed three stitches.
""That moment was horrifying. I feel like they came from hell,"" she says, at a loss to understand a dehumanising cycle of hatred against people simply expressing their views.
""They do this in the name of freedom. But it's just sheer violence.""
The intensity of this hatred is being taken as a direct challenge to a system that has guaranteed stability, prosperity and a quiet life. For them, the pro-democracy movement is staffed by thugs with little understanding of political realities.
""Why don't they recognise themselves as Chinese? You can't deny this because we have black hair and yellow skin,"" Ms Chu says.
""Do you think Hong Kong can ever be separated from China?""
Few - on either side - have a clear grasp of the legal complexities of Hong Kong's special status, which makes safeguarding its fate all the more precarious. So the arguments end up being about ideology, identity and history. Ms Chu came from the mainland in her 20s. Many others of her generation, but born and bred in Hong Kong, will recall grandparents' tales about life in China. In the 1960s those grandparents may have swum over. Although they left China behind, it remains part of their identity.
The younger generation out on the streets does not share such memories - it is easier for them to disregard the older ties that bind. Their touchstones are globalised cultural memes of defiance: ""If we burn, you burn with us"" - they chant referencing The Hunger Games; Can You Hear the People Sing? they belt out from Les Miserables; Pepe the Frog, a symbol of the alt right movement, was also adopted - certainly unwittingly.
Ms Chu, though, feels alarm when strangers walk past quickly.
Over the past six months, Celine, a protester in her 20s, has attended almost every single march or rally going - and fought hard.
""Every time I am terrified. But I still do the same next time.""
The fear she has on the frontline is, she says, dwarfed by her fear of what could come if she doesn't act. She is afraid of the way China has weighed in on Hong Kong's politics. After five booksellers who sold salacious books about Chinese leaders turned up in Chinese custody, after China interpreted Hong Kong's mini-constitution so a few pro-democracy lawmakers could be disqualified, she asked herself: if they can do this now, what might happen when that mini-constitution expires in 2047?
This is a fear shared by an entire generation. She will be in her 50s. Her generation will be parents. What will become of their children?
In the beginning, she only set up roadblocks using bricks. Soon her hands no longer shook when she threw petrol bombs.
With each passing month of exhausting and escalating protest, she watched both her resolve harden and her fear increase. The clashes bring thrills but everything changed for her during the siege of Hong Kong's Polytechnic University in November.
It was the site of a three-day showdown between police and protesters barricaded on the campus. Hours of intense fighting saw huge fires, petrol bombs, bricks and even bows and arrows being fired at police. Police struck back with rubber bullets, water cannon and tear gas so dense people could not see through the choking clouds.
""I thought I might die inside.""
""I saw a pool of blood,"" she says. ""Many people were bleeding from their heads and they were crying.""
She eventually managed to escape without being arrested.
Now, whenever she passes the university during bus rides she cries uncontrollably and finds it difficult to breathe.
Many young protesters acknowledge that their actions, while raising awareness, may only increase the likelihood of a more fundamental crackdown at some point. They know the risks but it is about balancing the probabilities of fears.
For those that speak out against protests - there is another, more deep-seated fear. They say that their Hong Kong, the safe prosperous society they built, is disappearing. Although staying silent was not ideal, they worry that this path is inevitable self-destruction from within rather than the feared assault from outside.
Mr Tsang's mind went blank when he received a call one rainy October evening telling him that his daughter had been arrested in a protest. He was on a night shift as a security guard but hopped on a bus and arrived at the police station soaking wet.
It was after midnight when he finally saw his daughter Alice. The 16-year-old was followed by police officers and her hands were bound.
""We didn't need to speak,"" Mr Tsang says. ""We could understand each other.""
Alice has been charged with rioting, an offence which could lead to up to a decade in jail.
She's one of about 1,000 underage demonstrators who have been arrested since protests started in June. She says she isn't a frontline protester, but couldn't leave the protest site because every route was surrounded by police.
One of the most striking moments over the past few months was when school headteachers went to Polytechnic University to try to negotiate the release of their students. The first person to be shot by a live bullet was a secondary-school student. It is not just young people, but adolescents who have got involved. They may court dangerous thrills, but they believe they are safeguarding uncertain futures. Either way the trauma and the impact on this generation is yet to be properly understood.
In Mr Tsang's eyes, Alice is an ordinary teenager who loves make-up and shopping. She's also a daddy's girl who sometimes gets jealous of the family cat: ""She says I love the cat more than her.""
He has always known she was a protester: ""I can't lock her up at home. No parent should do that.""
Yet he also witnessed a positive change in her because of the protests. She became more confident and made more friends. For a girl with depression and anxiety, that meant a lot. She is a living example of a culture of youth solidarity that has embodied these protests. They feel the older generation hasn't safeguarded their future, so it is in their hands - they have no options.
He still lets her join protests, but only those with police approval - he does not want to crush her ideals.
In 2013, Lily Wong became a widow. Her husband died of a heart attack, leaving her with two young sons.
Three years ago she set up a snack shop as she didn't want to be on social welfare any more.
Business had been booming at Ms Wong's snack shop. Patrons travelled from other districts to taste her handmade steamed rice rolls, pudding cakes and herbal drinks. Recently, she thought that she might just be able save enough for a mortgage down payment.
But all that changed after she uploaded a photo to Facebook of her attending a pro-police rally. Ms Wong says she supports the police because it is the duty of police officers to maintain law and order.
""I don't regret uploading the photo because I just expressed my personal opinion.""
The backlash was immediate. Young people stopped coming to her shop and it has become the target of health and safety complaints.
In October, officials from different departments visited her shop almost every other day, she says: they came to investigate things like food hygiene and compliance with fire regulations. Apps in Hong Kong now identify outlets as either ""blue"" - sympathetic towards police - or ""yellow"", which means protest sympathisers.
During one such visit, she broke down in tears: ""I was very emotional. I support my family and I want stability for them. But it felt like I was being pushed to the edge of a cliff.""
Ms Wong mourns the loss of the old Hong Kong. ""Hong Kong is a wonderful place. No matter one's education level, as long as one's willing to work, one will not starve,"" she says.
""Now, even eating is decided by colours.""
She understands young people feel the need to fight for their future, but feels they are ignoring the cost of their actions and the fruits of the efforts of past generations.
""Society has been torn by politics, and I feel sad for it.""
It was Derek's childhood dream to become a policeman. Officers always look sharp in cop movies and he truly believed he could help people.
But now he wants to quit.
Obedience is the most prized quality for police officers, as Derek has known from his first day - with little room for dissent.
For months, as violence has raged in Hong Kong, police officers have been wearing masks and their warrant cards have not been on display. Police say the masks are protective, but protesters say police are trying to conceal their identity to escape accountability.
""When I am on duty, I don't hide my face and I show my police number,"" Derek says. ""This is a principle I adhere to."" But this had implications for him on the front line when a senior officer questioned his motives.
For the police, this has all been genuinely tough. Officers have to put in at least 15 hours a day. Riot gear is heavy and it's exhausting to run around in the scorching sun. Policemen and their families have been doxxed - meaning their personal information has been leaked online - many feel this is just for doing their job. They face hatred just as much as they are accused of fuelling it.
Nonetheless, Derek feels there are no excuses for the unruly behaviour of police officers caught on camera beating protesters or opening fire: ""Frontline officers have no restraint and use excessive force,"" he says.
He disapproves of unquestioning loyalty within the police force - but he thinks the same thing is happening among protesters. He can't accept any assault on people of different political persuasions.
""I asked my pro-protest friends if they would distance themselves from this - all of them said no,"" Derek says.
So he doesn't know where he stands in this new Hong Kong.
For mainland-born Benjamin, the protests have finally made him consider himself a Hongkonger - after more than a decade.
On 16 June he spent five hours marching from Victoria Park to Admiralty by himself - a march that protesters said was attended by two million people.
""I am proud of this city,"" Benjamin says. He was touched by the resolve of the peaceful marchers.
But he is at odds with the community known as gang piao - (a Mandarin term which means Hong Kong drifters). These are the well-educated Chinese elites who move to Hong Kong. Every year, the government accepts 20,000 such ""drifters"", often scorned by locals for taking jobs.
""I can say 99 out of 100 drifters see their Chinese identity as unassailable,"" Benjamin says, and that they see a distinct Hong Kong identity as unacceptable.
Many mainlanders feel they have dedicated themselves to the city, but are suspected of just being ""brainwashed"" automatons. They cannot help but wonder if a touch of xenophobia is involved, even from people who they believe to be of their ""own kind"" - another example of how complex identity and allegiances are.
After university, Benjamin was determined to leave mainland China. He valued personal freedoms and had a natural scepticism towards the authoritarian Chinese government.
But it has also been difficult for him to build friendships with locals because of differences in background and language. ""We can... have dinner together,"" he says. ""But we can't become good friends.""
An August encounter with a pro-protest Uber driver sticks in his mind.
After a minor argument over a pick-up, ""he said to me that he could tell I am not from here by my accent,"" Benjamin recounts.
When he and two friends were thrown out of the car, his friends seized the opportunity.
""They said, 'Don't you stand on their side? Oh, they don't see you as one of them?'""
He is now looking to move away from Hong Kong and China.
The city is living a double life. Protests at the weekend, business as usual on weekdays.
But Hong Kong has entered its first recession in a decade, with the number of tourists plummeting more than 40%.
Mr Chan, who has been working as a hawker for more than four decades, knows that tough times have come. Before the protests, he made more than HK$1,000 (about $130; Â£100) every day. ""Now we only make a few hundred dollars.""
His account is a corrective to the narrative that economic decline will infuriate Hongkongers - it hasn't yet. But shops are closing down and people are feeling financial pain.
Despite this, the 67-year-old remains unfazed, even though Kowloon has become a battleground.
A Guangzhou native, Mr Chan was witness to the Cultural Revolution - he once saw a peasant being beaten to death by children. He swam to Hong Kong in 1973.
Mr Chan doesn't blame the protesters for his losses.
""The future belongs to the youth, and they are fighting for things they want,"" he says. ""We have enjoyed the most prosperous time, and we can only accept when things go downhill. It's as simple as that.""
James was in school for the 2014 Occupy Movement which eventually fizzled out - the protesters had lost.
On the last night before the clearance of the protest site, someone hung a banner with the words: ""It's just the beginning.""
""People said we would be back. In the beginning I wasn't that optimistic. I thought it would take at least 10 years,"" James says. ""I didn't know it would happen so quickly.""
James was in awe when a million took to the streets on 9 June. But he was especially touched by a July march organised by senior citizens who call themselves ""the silver-haired"". He did not know there would be so many older people who support the protests.
It was not the same experience at home - where he sees protesters as critical to defending Hong Kong's civil liberties, his parents think they are trouble-makers.
""My mother said it was right to beat people, and it's better to punish them all.""
These differences have also upset his mother: ""I have raised him... provided an education for him. The way he treats his elders makes me uncomfortable,"" she says. ""He said I am not educated and know nothing.
""I don't care about which side he supports politically. But he can't treat his parents this way.""
Seeing the older protesters was a moment of exhilaration for him, a bridge between generations.
These protests have been pivotal in cementing identity for thousands more like James across Hong Kong. It is no longer just a free-wheeling capitalist dream, where as long as you make money political apathy will rule the day. In just over 20 years it has seen one of the most rapid developments of group identity.
But it doesn't just go one way.
""China has developed well,"" says Lily Wong, who runs the snack shop. ""Young people don't understand their identities and their origins.""
She is one of those who feels the breath of China over their shoulder and is not chilled by it - but reassured.
They too have enjoyed being open about their feelings despite threats and condemnation from the many who support the cause of the protesters.
What nobody can do is tell us where Hong Kong goes from here. What they all know is that no matter what their view, they will fight with all their heart for what they believe is the best for the city.

You Ought to Have a Look _is a regular feature from the Center for the Study of Science. While this section will feature all of the areas of interest that we are emphasizing, the prominence of the climate issue is driving a tremendous amount of web traffic. Here we post a few of the best in recent days, along with our color commentary._   
  
\---   
  
We highlight this week a collection of items which have a common thread—poorly informed beliefs lead to poorly formulated policy. And poorly formulated policy is worse than no policy at all.   
  
For starters, consider this article by Cato senior fellow Johan Norberg, in support of his new book, _Progress: Ten Reasons to Look Forward to the Future_ _._ Writing in CapX, Norberg looks at the reasons “Why are we determined to deny that things are getting better?” He points to how the media, in combination with our own psychological tendencies, lead us to the false assumption that the state of the world is declining, when in fact, trends are overwhelmingly in the other direction. Norberg points out that there is a danger in our misperception, “People led by fear risk curtailing the freedom that progress depends on.”   
  
Here are some expects from his article:   




A couple of years ago, I commissioned a study in which 1,000 Swedes were asked eight questions about global development. On average, every age group and every income group was wrong on all eight questions – because they all thought the world was in bad shape and getting worse. Large majorities, for example, thought that hunger and extreme poverty have been increasing, when they have in fact been reduced faster than at any other point in world history. And those who had been through higher education actually had less knowledge than the rest.   
  
It’s not just Sweden. In Britain, only 10 per cent of people thought that world poverty had decreased in the past 30 years. More than half thought it had increased. In the United States, only 5 per cent answered (correctly) that world poverty had been almost halved in the last 20 years: 66 per cent thought it had almost doubled.   
  
Why do we make these false assumptions? Many of them are formed by the media, which reinforces a particular way of looking at the world – a tendency to focus on the dramatic and surprising, which is almost always bad news, like war, murder and natural disasters.   
  
…[P]eople led by fear might curtail the freedom and the openness that progress depends on. When Matt Ridley, author of _The Rational Optimist_ , is asked what he is worried about, he usually responds “superstition and bureaucracy”, because superstition can obstruct the accumulation of knowledge, and bureaucracy can stop us from applying that knowledge in new technologies and businesses.



Johan’s full article, along with his new book, are well worth the taking the time to explore. A good place to start is this Cato book series event, where you can listen to Johan talk about his viewpoint and describe his findings.



  
  
Speaking of books, another provocative one hit the shelves recently. _25 Myths That Are Destroying the Environment: What Many Environmentalists Believe and Why They Are Wrong_ is latest in the collection of books by environmental biologist and lukewarmer compatriot Daniel Botkin. Dan has been in the center of the issue of global warming and its impacts on the environment since the beginning and often writes about his research and observations on the inherent robustness (rather than the oft-forwarded fragility) of nature. In _25 Myths_ , Botkin again includes that myth along with a large collection of others. From the back cover:   




_25 Myths That Are Destroying the Environment_ explores the many myths circulating in both ecological and political discussions. These myths often drive policy and opinion, and Botkin is here to set the record straight. What may seem like an environmentally conscious action on one hand may very well be bringing about the unnatural destruction of habitats and ecosystems.   
  
Topics include:   
  
\- Is life really that fragile?   
  
\- Is consensus science?   
  
\- Are recent weather patterns truly proof of long term weather change?   
  
-Are wildfires really all that bad?   
  
-Are predators absolutely necessary to control populations of other species?   
  
In a world awash in misleading or false information about the environment, Daniel Botkin has written a straightforward and concise examination of the biggest myths hurting conservation efforts today.   
  
If our society is to sustain the environment around us for future generations, solving environmental problems by understanding how nature works is not just helpful, it's necessary.



Sounds like good advice!   
  
And while we’re on the topics of myths, we’ll finish up this week with a recommendation to check out Bjorn Lomborg’s piece in the _Wall Street Journal_ , “About Those Non-Disappearing Pacific Islands.” Lomborg takes a closer look at what’s going on in the Marshall Islands and finds, despite popular (mis)perceptions of global warming-fueled rising oceans swallowing the islands and giving rise to climate change refugees, that sea level rise is the least of their worries—in fact, the islands aren’t succumbing to sea level rise at all, and instead are _gaining_ area. The details are in Bjorn’s article along with his identification of real problems there—poverty and government corruption. But this doesn’t play as well to the press as global warming does. According to Lomborg:   




Telling viewers in the U.S. starkly that they’re “making this island disappear,” as a report from CNN’s John Sutter did in June 2015, makes for good, blame-laden television. But this reductionist, fact-averse rhetoric contributes to the idea that climate-change discussion should be a two-sided, cartoonish fight between those who say it is not real and those who say it is the worst problem facing humanity.



And like Norberg and Botkin, Lomborg, too, sees big problems with these misleading storylines. He continues:   




Even more insidiously, doom-mongering makes us panic and seize upon the wrong responses to global warming. At a cost of between $1 trillion and $2 trillion annually, the Paris climate agreement, recently ratified by China, is likely to be history’s most expensive treaty. It will slow the world’s economic growth to force a shift to inefficient green energy sources.   
  
This will achieve almost nothing.



Yep!

"The head of the UN’s climate finance body has pledged to tackle complaints of misconduct at the organisation “as a matter of urgency”, after such claims against unidentified staff members were published. Yannick Glemarec, the executive director of the Green Climate Fund, told the Guardian: “We need to continue working on building the culture of the organisation. Trust is key for our organisation.” Glemarec was responding to a report in the Financial Times that there had been 40 complaints to the GCF’s independent integrity unit last year. The FT published no details (£) on Thursday of the alleged misconduct at the 330-strong headquarters in South Korea, but claimed the complaints included an unspecified number about racism, sexism and harassment. Glemarec said there was a high number of complaints – up from 21 the previous year – because the unit dealt with a wide range of minor issues regarding staff discipline and personnel, and not just misconduct complaints. Only one complaint in 2018 and one in 2019 were upheld. He said one reason why issues of varying degrees of seriousness were lumped together was because the GCF was a young organisation. Glemarec, who took up his post in April 2019, said the process would be streamlined in future. He held an online forum for all staff in which they could ask questions and raise concerns about the issues alleged by the FT, and has promised training for managers on the organisation’s values. The fund, which has a climate finance portfolio of £6.2bn invested, was set up after the Copenhagen climate summit in 2009, at which developed countries pledged that by 2020 at least $100bn a year of public and private finance would flow to developing nations to help them cut greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the impacts of the climate crisis. Glemarec said the GCF would focus on the UN’s forthcoming climate summit, called Cop26 and postponed by a year to next November because of the coronavirus crisis. While renewable energy projects were increasingly attractive to private investors as the costs tumbled, he said, there was a role for government-funded investment in areas where there was no clear financial return, such as protecting the poor and vulnerable from the impacts of extreme weather and global heating. The GCF board recently approved $879m of funding to projects around the world."

A vigorous campaign aimed at American policymakers and the general public has tried to create the perception that a federal carbon tax (or similar type of “carbon price”) is a crucial element in the urgently needed response to climate change. Within conservative and libertarian circles, a small but vocal group of academics, analysts, and political officials are claiming that a revenue‐​neutral carbon tax swap could even deliver a “double dividend” — meaning that the conventional economy would be spurred in addition to any climate benefits. The present study details several serious problems with these claims. The actual economics of climate change — as summarized in the peer‐​reviewed literature as well as the U.N. and Obama Administration reports — reveal that the case for a U.S. carbon tax is weaker than the public has been told.



In the policy debate over carbon taxes, a key concept is the “social cost of carbon,” which is defined as the (present value of) future damages caused by emitting an additional ton of carbon dioxide. Estimates of the SCC are already being used to evaluate federal regulations, and will serve as the basis for any U.S. carbon tax. Yet the computer simulations used to generate SCC estimates are largely arbitrary, with plausible adjustments in parameters — such as the discount rate — causing the estimate to shift by at least an order of magnitude. Indeed, MIT economist Robert Pindyck considers the whole process so fraught with unwarranted precision that he has called such computer simulations “close to useless” for guiding policy.



Future economic damages from carbon dioxide emissions can only be estimated in conjunction with forecasts of climate change. But recent history shows those forecasts are in flux, with an increasing number of forecasts of less warming appearing in the scientific literature in the last four years. Additionally, we show some rather stark evidence that the family of models used by the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) are experiencing a profound failure that greatly reduces their forecast utility.



Ironically, the latest U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report indicated that a popular climate target cannot be justified in cost/​benefit terms. Specifically, in the middle‐​of‐​the‐​road scenarios, the economic compliance costs of limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius would likely be higher than the climate change damages that such a cap would avoid. In other words, the U.N.’s own report shows that aggressive emission cutbacks — even if achieved through an “efficient” carbon tax — would probably cause more harm than good.



If the case for emission cutbacks is weaker than the public has been led to believe, the claim of a “double dividend” is on even shakier ground. There really is a “consensus” in this literature, and it is that carbon taxes cause more economic damage than generic taxes on labor or capital, so that in general even a revenueneutral carbon tax swap will probably reduce conventional GDP growth. (The driver of this result is that carbon taxes fall on narrower segments of the economy, and thus to raise a given amount of revenue require a higher tax rate.) Furthermore, in the real world at least some of the new carbon tax receipts would probably be devoted to higher spending (on “green investments”) and lump‐​sum transfers to poorer citizens to help offset the impact of higher energy prices. Thus in practice the economic drag of a new carbon tax could be far worse than the idealized revenueneutral simulations depict.



When moving from academic theory to historical experience, we see that carbon taxes have not lived up to the promises of their supporters. In Australia, the carbon tax was quickly removed after the public recoiled against electricity price hikes and a faltering economy. Even in British Columbia — touted as the world’s finest example of a carbon tax — the experience has been underwhelming. After an initial (but temporary) drop, the B.C. carbon tax has not yielded significant reductions in gasoline purchases, and it has arguably reduced the B.C. economy’s performance relative to the rest of Canada.



Both in theory and practice, economic analysis shows that the case for a U.S. carbon tax is weaker than its most vocal supporters have led the public to believe. At the same time, there is mounting evidence in the physical science of climate change to suggest that human emissions of carbon dioxide do not cause as much warming as is assumed in the current suite of official models. Policymakers and the general public must not confuse the confidence of carbon tax proponents with the actual strength of their case.

"Khoja Zada found his son around noon; his body was under layers of rubble and mud. The rain had stopped and the sun was shining again when the 70-year-old dug him out. At midnight, he buried him again. Less than a week after flash floods killed at least 116 people – including Zada’s 35-year-old son – and injured 120 more in Charikar, the capital of Afghanistan’s Parwan province, Zada’s house lies destroyed, each room filled almost to the ceiling with what is now dry mud. Like dozens of others, the family has lost everything and is homeless; caught between tiredness and sadness.  “Many people are still missing, so we have to keep going,” the vegetable vendor tells the Guardian. “We don’t have enough tools and shovels, but we work as hard as we can.” After heavy rains on Tuesday, flash floods hit the outskirts of Charikar city in the early hours of Wednesday morning, washing away houses and cars before the sun had risen. “Rescue teams are still in the area and searching for the missing bodies,” Wahida Shahkar, Parwan’s governor’s spokeswoman says. Zada explains that most houses in the area – once a cluster of colourful buildings with tree-lined roads and a mosque in the middle – had been built between 15 and 30 years ago. Much of the neighbourhood had developing informally, meaning that houses were not immediately registered with the municipality and residents did not necessarily consider the risk of building near the steep barren mountainside. The area was later connected to the power grid and a school and clinic were built, but nothing was done to stop potential flooding. Flash floods are common in Afghanistan, with the mountainous, arid terrain meaning that millions of people are exposed to hazards such as floods, droughts, avalanches and landslides, a Climate Security Expert Network report found. Afghanistan ranks as one of the most vulnerable countries in the 2019 Climate Risk Index, the report said. In the 19th century, the country was covered by a mix of open woodlands and closed forests that stabilised slopes and slowed the flow of water on mountainsides. Large-scale deforestation has reduced forest cover to just 1.5% in today’s Afghanistan, increasing the risk of flash floods throughout the country. In Parwan, about an hour’s drive north of Kabul, about 15,000 people have been displaced by disasters including floods since 2012, according to the International Organization for Migration. “Barren mountainsides like the ones in Parwan lead to rainwater flowing rapidly, resulting in the destruction of soil and causing floods,” says Jalaludin Naseri, director of national heritage protection at Afghanistan’s National Environmental Protection Agency. In Charikar, residents are worried more flooding might occur in coming months as more rain is expected. Diana Raufi, 25, says she always felt safe in her neighbourhood until last week. “I woke up to what sounded like an earthquake,” she says, sitting in a room with several other women and Fatana, 4, one of her two daughters. “When I heard the water rushing, I screamed. I took my Qur’an and started praying. I still don’t know how we survived, but I’m afraid more floods will come.” Raufi has since been staying with friends in a house that was spared from the waters, sleeping on a mat on the floor with her daughters, her own house reduced to a pile of rubble. Her husband, an opium addict, “roams the streets and doesn’t work” and has not found a new home for the family. Raufi says she would have liked to help, but few women are seen outside the neighbourhood, with mostly men taking on the post-flood labour. Women and children have left to stay with extended family in nearby villages, while men who usually work in the capital, Kabul, returned to Charikar. Abdul Wakil is one of them. The 30-year-old lost his mother, a sister, a brother and two nephews to the floods. His wife and five children survived. “They called me immediately after it happened,” he says. “I took a taxi right away, crying throughout the entire journey.” A week on, he sits with Ebrahim, his six-year-old son, who has barely spoken since the floods destroyed the family home. “He is still afraid,” Wakil says. “He was with us when we buried our family, including his two best friends – cousins who were about his age.” Frustrated, he says little help had arrived. “Today we received two new kettles for cooking, but how does it help us? We need help digging out our houses and we need flood protection walls installed further up the hill,” he says. “If nothing changes, I will take my family to Kabul with me.”"
"**Some of the last protesters remaining at a besieged university in Hong Kong have tried to escape and evade police by crawling through sewers.**
Hundreds of protesters have already left PolyU but dozens remain inside.
The campus - the scene of some of the most intense clashes witnessed during months of anti-government protests - is surrounded by police who are arresting for rioting any adults trying to leave.
Six people were arrested on Wednesday for an attempted escape via the sewers.
The group included two men climbing out of an underground drain and four people - three men and a woman - who had removed a manhole cover and lowered a rope into the drain to assist them, police said.
""It was complicated and dark down there, I wanted to get home as soon as possible,"" one young man who unsuccessfully attempted a sewer escape told BBC Chinese. ""But how else could we leave the PolyU campus?""
The four-day campus siege at PolyU - Hong Kong Polytechnic University - has been one of the most dramatic confrontations in the wider protest movement that has paralysed the city for more than five months
The protests started after the government planned to pass a bill that would allow suspects to be extradited to mainland China. The bill was eventually withdrawn, but the demonstrations continued, having evolved into a broader protest against alleged police brutality, and the way the former British colony is administered by Beijing.
PolyU is the last of five Hong Kong universities that protesters had occupied in the last 10 days. Fewer than 100 hardcore demonstrators remain on the campus after days of violent clashes with security forces.
Many have surrendered to police or emerged as part of medical evacuations. More than 1,000 people have been arrested. Those under 18 were allowed to go home but had their details registered.
Several small groups of protesters seeking to avoid possibly years in prison if arrested on rioting charges have reportedly attempted a dangerous escape route through the sewers. They have descended into the tunnels armed with torches and gas masks.
The fire brigade have now blocked the main entrance into the sewers within the PolyU campus to thwart such escapes. On Tuesday and Wednesday divers searched the tunnels for any protesters who might have been trapped but found none.
Whether any protesters have successfully escaped via the sewers remains unclear, despite rumours on campus to the contrary. The two arrested on Wednesday made it about half a kilometre from the university when they emerged and were arrested.
Bowie, a 21-year-old student who made an attempt, told Reuters news agency: ""The sewer was very smelly, with many cockroaches, many snakes. Every step was very, very painful. I'd never thought that one day I would need to hide in a sewer or escape through sewers to survive.""
Her group spent an hour swimming in the fetid water, but when they emerged, were crushed to realise they were still within the university grounds, she said.
Tunnelling out of campus is just the latest escape plan hatched by increasingly desperate protesters. On Monday, dozens slid down ropes from a bridge, fleeing on waiting motorcycles. Police said nearly 40 of them were later arrested.
Some have tried to flee under cover of darkness while many others have tried to get through police lines, some being beaten before being arrested."

Three years ago, I ran into former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd at a ritzy Northwest Washington restaurant. We exchanged pleasantries, but before long, our conversation became unpleasant.



Since climate science is my field, I felt compelled to point out that Rudd’s support for a cap‐​and‐​trade policy for carbon emissions had recently helped cost him his job as PM. “Well, what should I have done?” Rudd replied. “My scientists, I say, my scientists, told me this is an important problem.”



Having closely followed implementation of Mr. Rudd’s cap‐​and‐​trade, my response was admittedly a little testy: “Your scientists said exactly what you paid them to tell you.” It took less than an hour for the daily newspaper _The Australian_ to get wind of the encounter.





How government scientists plunder the till in the name of science.



That brief interaction with Mr. Rudd is indicative of a widespread problem: The government of Australia, and pretty much every other nation, funds research scientists and then relies on them for policy guidance. It is in the best interest of these government‐​funded scientists to ensure their fields — and therefore their jobs — are deemed of great importance.



The problem is particularly costly when it comes to environmental science.



In the United States, government‐​funded scientists are required to produce a National Climate Assessment every four years. The assessment is produced by the U.S. Global Change Research Program, a 13‐​agency behemoth with multibillion‐​dollar annual funding. Under its empowering legislation, the assessments are “for the Environmental Protection Agency for use in the formulation of a coordinated national policy on global climate change .”



The research program and the individuals who write such reports are the largest consumers of federal largesse on climate science. Would they ever produce a report saying that their issue is of diminishing importance — so much so that EPA regulations of greenhouse gases are simply not needed? No, not unless they are tired of first‐​class travel and the praise of their universities, which are hopelessly addicted to the 50 percent “overhead” they charge on science grants.



The perils of science‐​by‐​government‐​funded‐​committee became apparent in their first assessment in 2000. The models they used were worse than no forecast at all.



If, for example, the U.S. Global Change Research Program’s computer models were given a multiple‐​choice test with 100 questions and four possible answers each, simply spitting out random numbers would, within statistical limits, get around 1 out of 4 (25 percent) correct. The initial assessment, however, would get only 1 out of 8 answers correct (12.5 percent) — essentially performing twice as badly as a random series of numbers.



The research program was aware of this problem and published its report anyway.



The reigning assessment is the 2009 version, which has been considered authoritative and is largely the basis for the EPA’s greenhouse‐​gas regulations. It was missing so much science that I produced an addendum, in exactly the same format as the original, which was actually longer and contained more references.



Later this year, the U.S. Global Change Research Program is scheduled to publish its quadrennial replacement. The draft has been circulated for public comment. In its 1,200 horror‐​studded pages, almost everything that happens in our world — sex, birth, disease, death, hunger and wars, to name a few — is somehow affected, usually for the worse, by pernicious emissions of carbon dioxide. Before the end of the 60‐​day public comment period, 133 single‐​spaced pages of comments from my organization alone barely scratched the surface of the report’s failings.



The main problem is that the new draft ignores the spate of science since 2010 detailing the long‐​predicted (at least, by some of us) lowering of temperature projections. You can read about this in The Economist, _The New York Times_ , and the United Kingdom’s Spectator, but you won’t find it in the current research program’s document. As our review says, “Without the addition of the new projections, the [National Climate Assessment] will be obsolete on the day of its official release.”



Later this year, government science goes international with the release of the next Scientific Assessment of Climate Change by the United Nations body that tracks the issue. It suffers from the same problem as the draft research program document — because the same people produced both reports. It, too, will serve as the basis for policy, and it, too, will be obsolete the day it is published.



In Big Science, money is power. Money is publications. Money is promotion and tenure, television time, awards, rewards and a permanent ticket out of coach. There’s simply no incentive for scientists to do anything but perpetuate their issues.



This is why, in 2018, when former President Barack Obama is confronted about his mandate of tiny cars because of dreaded climate change, he might say, “Well, what should I have done? My scientists, I say, my scientists, told me this is an important problem.”

Chapter 3 of EPA’s the Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) for the Proposed Standards of Performance for Greenhouse Gas Emissions for New Stationary Sources: Electric Utility Generating Units is concerned with “The climate change problem and rationale for rulemaking.” The Chapter “summarizes the adverse effects on public health and public welfare detailed in the 2009 Endangerment Finding” and has this to say regarding the source of the scientific opinions underlying the Endangerment Finding:



The major assessments by the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and the National Research Council (NRC) served as the primary scientific basis for these effects.



In fact, the USGCRP 2009 report, Global Climate Change Impacts in the United States is the only one of these documents that relates directly and purposefully to climate change in the U.S. It is therefore of much more import than the other two.



The EPA’s proposed rule states that “There is no reason to revisit the 2009 Endangerment Finding given recent scientific findings that strengthen the scientific conclusion that GHG air pollution endangers human health and welfare.”

You have heard the phrase “an inconvenient truth” no doubt before. The view from this bach window is inconvenient because it reveals a truth about **Waitarere Beach** that goes completely against the stories we are all being fed about coastal property being in danger because of Climate Change.



I was working down at Waitarere Beach and seeing the view from the bach window I remarked to the owner that I had stayed at the beach for a week 51 years ago.



She replied, **“I bet you didn’t have to walk so far to the beach back then.”**



To cut a long story short below is a photo taken from the bach window looking out at the Waitarere Beach Lifesaving club that is not used **because it’s too far from the surf!**



They are trying to fundraise to build a pavilion closer to the beach but the council is reluctant to consent because of erosion which seems very odd as if there was an erosion problem surely the Lifesaving club would have moved closer to the sea not further away!



It is further along this beach that the [Hydrabad ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrabad_\(ship\))ran ashore in 1878. I remember it being around or above the high tide mark in 1969!



If you read this [2013 _Stuff_ article](http://www.stuff.co.nz/manawatu-standard/opinion/blogs/outside-the-square/8359555/Digging-for-the-Hydrabad-shipwreck) that mentions the shipwreck they actually admit that the beach extends by more than a metre a year! (I thought that the science was settled, _Stuff_ ).



[…] the wreck itself has now disappeared. Coastal processes mean a constant supply of sand replenishes the dunes at Waitarere, rarely eroding away. **The beach at Waitarere extends by over a metre each year as a result**. 135 years later, the sand that sunk the Hydrabad has now swallowed it for good measure.



The wreck lies under the sand, its location marked by an enormous blue post. Locals tell me that if I want to see even a tiny piece of her, I need to dig.



“It’s only just below the surface.”



This is the view from Google maps. Red is where my above photo was taken from!



Here is[ the street view](https://www.google.co.nz/maps/@-40.5481557,175.1943959,3a,75y,101.5h,76.25t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1sAF1QipPuKfgR2XWMKFaeuoryBroDhCAVjyJMPChdLoNz!2e10!3e11!6shttps:%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipPuKfgR2XWMKFaeuoryBroDhCAVjyJMPChdLoNz%3Dw203-h100-k-no-pi0-ya301.84967-ro-0-fo100!7i6144!8i3072?hl=en).

“Is it OK to still have children?” That’s a question that bothers the environmental consciousness of Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY). Comedian Bill Maher thinks that he has the answer. “The great under-discussed factor in the climate crisis is there are just too many of us and we use too much s*#t. Climate deniers like to say, ‘There’s no population problem, just look out the window of an airplane. So much open space down there.’ But it’s not about space, it’s about resources. Humans are already using 1.7 times the resources the planet can support,” he recently noted. There are plenty of legitimate topics in the debate about the health of the planet, but overuse of resources is not one of them.   
  
Humanity’s impact on the planet is deep, but that does not mean that Earth’s future is hopeless. The loss of biodiversity, as the U.N. report recently found, could become a problem, but that can be mitigated by greater urbanization and higher yield crops, thus enabling people to leave an ever-increasing portion of the countryside to flora and fauna. Pollution of rivers, lakes and oceans, which is partly driven by overuse of fertilizer and pesticide in agriculture, could be mitigated by genetically-modified crops that require little of either. Overabundance of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and the threat of global warming could be mitigated through nuclear power production.   
  
The one concern that we believe people do not have to worry about is the overuse of resources. Late last year, we co-authored a study titled, _The Simon Abundance Index: A New Way to Measure Availability of Resources_. In that paper we looked at the prices of 50 foundational commodities covering energy, food, materials and metals. Between 1980 and 2017, our findings showed, resources have become substantially more abundant. Our calculations confirmed the insights of the University of Maryland economist Julian Simon who observed in his 1981 book _The Ultimate Resource_ that humans are intelligent beings, capable of innovating their way out of shortages through greater efficiency, increased supply, and the development of substitutes.   
  
To arrive at our conclusions, we have come up with four new concepts: Time Price, Price Elasticity of Population, the Simon Abundance Framework and Simon Abundance Index ®. Today marks the second installment in what we hope will become an annual update of the relationship between population growth and resource availability. As was the case last year, we have looked at the prices of 50 basic commodities tracked by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (see Figure 1). The Simon Abundance Index ® 2019 covers the time period between 1980 and 2018.   




  


![Media Name: table333.png](/sites/cato.org/files/styles/pubs/public/wp-content/uploads/table333.png?itok=r4Xicggi)



  
  
The time price denotes the amount of time that a person has to work in order to earn enough money to buy something. To calculate the time price, the nominal money price is divided by nominal hourly income. (We got the latter dataset by combining the World Bank’s average global GDP per person with the Conference Board’s estimation of annual hours worked.) Between 1980 and 2018, the average time price of our basket of 50 basic commodities fell by 72.3 percent. The time it took to earn enough money to buy one unit in that basket of commodities in 1980 bought 3.62 units in 2018 (see Figure 2).   






The price elasticity of population (PEP) allows us to measure sensitivity of resource availability to population growth. Between 1980 and 2018, world’s population increased by 71.2 percent. The time price of commodities fell by 72.3 percent. As such, the time price of commodities declined by 1.016 percent for every 1 percent increase in the world’s population. Put differently, over the last 38 years, every additional human being born on our planet appears to have made resources proportionately more plentiful for the rest of us.   
  
The Simon Abundance Framework uses the PEP values to distinguish between different degrees of resource abundance, from decreasing abundance at one end of the spectrum to superabundance at the other end. Considering that time price of commodities decreased at a faster proportional rate (-72.3 percent) than population increased (71.2 percent), we conclude that humanity is experiencing superabundance.   
  
Finally, The Simon Abundance Index ® 2019 uses the time price of commodities and change in global population to estimate overall resource abundance. The Index represents the ratio of the change in population over the change in the time price, times 100. It has a base year of 1980 and a base value of 100. In 2018, the Index reached a level of 618.98. That is to say that the Earth was 518.98 percent more abundant in 2018 than it was in 1980 (see Figure 3). The compounded growth rate of abundance came to 3.44 percent per annum, which means that the affordability of our basket of commodities doubled every 20.49 years.   






Simon’s revolutionary insights with regard to the mutually beneficial interaction between population growth and availability of natural resources, which our research confirms, may be counterintuitive, but they are real. The world’s resources are finite in the same way that the number of piano keys is finite. The instrument has only 88 notes, but those can be played in an infinite variety of ways. The same applies to our planet. The Earth’s atoms may be fixed, but the possible combinations of those atoms are infinite. What matters, then, is not the physical limits of our planet, but human freedom to experiment and reimagine the use of resources that we have.   






_Notes on our methodology_   
  
Since last year, we have tweaked our methodology to make The Simon Abundance Index ® simpler and more robust. The most important change is that we no longer deflate commodity prices and income in any way. Economists differ on what kinds of deflators are appropriate. Moreover, deflators are unnecessary. Thus, in this year’s index, we arrive at our time prices, which underpin all of our subsequent calculations and findings, by simply dividing the nominal price of a commodity by the nominal hourly wage in 1980. We do the same for 2018.   
  
Note that the Index deals with global prices of commodities relative to the average global GDP per capita per hour. We recognize that GDP figures are not the same as wages. Unfortunately, a global hourly wage is tough to calculate – people work different numbers of hours, economies are composed of different kinds of workers, the proportion of non-wage compensations differs, etc. As such, GDP per capita per hour remains the best approximation of global hourly income. That said, what matters for our analysis is not the exact income level, but the ratio of change over time.

"MANHATTAN, Kan.  —   She was 18, majoring in   and settling in for her first year at Kansas State University, her dream school. Barely six weeks later, Crystal Stroup’s college career was suddenly and violently derailed. In October 2015, after a small   at their apartment, her friends got worried because Ms. Stroup had had too much to drink. They enlisted the   male student from downstairs to look after her while they went out for food. The next morning, Ms. Stroup woke up disoriented and in pain. Large bruises in the shape of hand prints were emerging on her upper arm and thigh. She struggled to go to class, where she told a friend, “I’ve been raped. ” Kansas State University had been warned about the man, Jared Gihring. Another student, Sara Weckhorst, said she had complained to university officials more than a year earlier that he had raped her while she was passed out drunk at a fraternity house. On Jan. 3, Mr. Gihring, 22, pleaded not guilty to charges of raping both women. A lawyer for Mr. Gihring, Brenda Jordan, did not respond to requests for comment. But it was only after Mr. Gihring’s arrest by the police here in July  —   more than two years after Ms. Weckhorst first complained  —   that Kansas State took action to expel him. Whether or not Ms. Stroup’s alleged rape was foreseeable  —   one of the issues posed by a lawsuit she filed against the university  —   her case raises disturbing questions about repeat offenses on campus, and whether universities do enough to prevent them. For several years, researchers have been fiercely debating how many campus rapes are committed by serial offenders. A 2002 study based on surveys of 1, 882 college men and published in Violence and Victims, an academic journal, found that as many as 63 percent of those who admitted to behaviors that fit the definition of rape or attempted rape said they had engaged in those behaviors more than once. But in 2015, a study of 1, 642 men at two different colleges was published in JAMA Pediatrics and found that while a larger number of men admitted to behaviors that constituted rape, a smaller percentage of them, closer to 25 percent, were repeat offenders. The difference could affect how universities approach rape investigations and prevention. For example, repeat cases raise questions of whether universities should be faster to remove students from campus after accusations. “There are repeat offenders who seek out victims and will do this time and time again with impunity because there is no punishment,” said Annie E. Clark, a   of End Rape on Campus, a nonprofit organization that works to assist those who have been raped and to prevent campus sexual violence. She added, “Whatever the number is, it’s way, way too high. ” A few recent cases, and the lawsuits they have spawned  —   like the one at Kansas State  —   have again put a spotlight on repeat campus rapes, and the questions they leave about whether something could have been done. Many university administrators say they are hampered in sexual assault investigations by women who are reluctant to identify their assailants or press charges. They also say that assaults frequently occur during parties at which students were drinking, leaving their memories clouded and the truth of what happened elusive. At Kansas State, the federal government is now involved, investigating the university’s handling of the 2014 complaint by Ms. Weckhorst. The university is facing lawsuits by Ms. Weckhorst and another Kansas State student, Tessa Farmer, who also alleges she reported a rape that was not properly investigated, as well as the case brought by Ms. Stroup, now 19, who joined Ms. Weckhorst’s lawsuit in November. At Indiana University, a former student, John P. Enochs, pleaded guilty last year to misdemeanor battery, the result of a plea bargain. He had initially faced two counts of rape. A lawsuit filed against the university in June by one of his accusers, identified as Jane Doe 62, says Mr. Enochs raped her while she was passed out from drinking at his fraternity house. The suit says the university ignored Mr. Enochs’s history of sexual assault, failing to take steps to protect her from rape. Nearly two years before Jane Doe 62 said she was raped, Mr. Enochs had been accused of sexual assault by another student. That woman supplied his name to university police, but initially declined to press charges. In a statement by its spokeswoman, Margie   the university said its policy “provides for prompt response, a fair, impartial and robust investigation, and adjudication process when responding to reports of alleged sexual assault. ” But, she added, “our ability to do so is also reliant on the involvement and cooperation of those who may have been harmed. ” Stanford University is fighting a lawsuit by a student who says she was sexually assaulted in 2014 by a man who had done the same to another student as early as 2011 and physically or sexually assaulted two other students. Nonetheless, the lawsuit says, the university permitted him to remain on campus through his 2014 graduation. The university  —   roiled last year by the Brock Turner sexual assault case and more recently by an article in The New York Times about its handling of sexual assault accusations against a football player  —   says in its court papers in the lawsuit that the first woman did not identify the man for nearly a year, then initially declined to participate in an investigation. “We have sympathy for the plaintiff in this case, but we will be vigorously defending the lawsuit as we believe that Stanford has acted with appropriate diligence and compassion within the constraints of privacy laws,” said a university spokeswoman, Lisa Lapin. Denise Cordova, the director of the office that investigates sexual assault accusations at the University of Nevada, Reno, said most students do not provide the name of the person they say assaulted them. “I think, from my perspective,” she said, “we don’t always have the information about the person who has done this. ” That was not the situation, however, at Kansas State. Danielle   a former Kansas State University sexual assault investigator, said she urged the college to be more aggressive in handling sexual assault complaints, ultimately reporting the university to the United States Education Department. “It makes me feel terrible that we might have been able to prevent it,” she said. She and others at Kansas State say the problem was that the university had taken the position that it was not responsible for investigating accusations of rape in fraternity houses because they are off campus. In her complaint to the Education Department, Ms.   said she was ordered to “stall” investigating a rape accusation at a fraternity house because the university did not want to be responsible. Also, the departing president of the university’s Interfraternity Council, Zach Lowry, said the university referred sexual assault complaints involving fraternities to his organization without investigation. “When we get these, they’re pretty disturbing,” said Mr. Lowry, a senior political science major from Stockton, Kan. “When we give them to our judicial board, they’re students. They’re not trained to handle investigations. ” Officials at Kansas State declined requests for interviews, but, in a statement, the university said its protocol was to “address misconduct and safety concerns expeditiously and it always has been. ” It added that “the blanket statement that   does not investigate   incidents is simply inaccurate. ” But Ms. Stroup believes her rape could have been prevented if the university had heeded warnings from Ms. Weckhorst, of Doylestown, Pa. On April 26, 2014, when she was a    freshman, Ms. Weckhorst had joined friends at Pillsbury Crossing, a recreation area near Kansas State’s campus that is known for its picturesque waterfalls and a shallow swimming area. After drinking as many as 13 shots of liquor, she said, she recalled little of what happened that day after 4 p. m. When she woke up hours later, she said, she was in a room filled with beds, completely naked, intoxicated and confused. As she lay face up on a mattress, a man she did not know was having sexual intercourse with her. “When Sara was able to get the male off her, she got up from the mattress and at that time the male made a statement that he wasn’t the first guy she’d had sex with that day,” the police report said. The man told Ms. Weckhorst that she also had sex twice that day with another man  —   once in the bed of a truck at Pillsbury Crossing and again when he drove her to the Sigma Nu fraternity house, according to the police report. Word of what had happened at Pillsbury Crossing circulated on the social media app Yik Yak, according to Ms. Weckhorst’s lawsuit. Ms. Weckhorst filed a complaint with an investigator for the university, naming Mr. Gihring and the other man, both Sigma Nu pledges. But the university employee told her that because the reported events occurred off campus, Kansas State would not take any action, according to her lawsuit. After the semester ended, she and her parents met with university officials on campus. “This will continue to affect our daughter for the rest of her life,” her mother said during the meeting. Nothing “will ever   what has been done by this facility of higher education. ” Mr. Gihring, of Newton, Kan. eventually moved to University Crossing, an apartment complex within view of the university’s football stadium. Ms. Stroup arrived at Kansas State from Clay Center, Kan. for her freshman year in August 2015. She also moved into University Crossing, in an apartment near Mr. Gihring. The lawsuit she filed in November says that, after the small gathering at their apartment on Oct. 6, 2015, her roommates left Mr. Gihring to watch over her while they went for food. “Once alone in the apartment, J. G. went into Crystal’s bedroom and raped her,” the complaint says, referring to Ms. Stroup. On the advice of her lawyer, Cari Simon, Ms. Stroup would not discuss details of that night because she may be called to testify in the criminal trial against Mr. Gihring, scheduled for May. Ms. Stroup said she had been under immense stress, partly because it was impossible to avoid Mr. Gihring on campus and at her apartment complex. Ultimately it affected her grades and forced her to drop out of school, she said. She now works in a nursing home kitchen, not exactly the health care career she had hoped for. “I don’t know how to pick up the pieces and start over again,” she said."

Readers may recall the announcement of the PR for the recent paper claiming Sea-Level rise from Antarctic ice sheet could double in WUWT. In a tongue and cheek way, I prefaced it with “Oh Noes!” due to the ridiculous claims being made from model output. I wasn’t the only one seeing this paper as flawed. It’s actually worse than we thought.

Guest essay by Patrick J. Michaels and  Paul C. “Chip” Knappenberger, Center for the Study of Science, Cato Institute
There’s one thing that climate scientists of all stripes and flavors agree would be an unmitigated disaster: A sudden and dramatic melting of land ice, raising sea levels ten feet or so in a century.
Three years ago, it appeared that this monster had been put to bed by Denmark’s Dorthe Dahl-Jensen, when her team drilled all the way down through the ice to Greenland’s bedrock, providing the first reliable data from there concerning the warmest period in recent geological history, known as the Eemian. She found that for six thousand years (roughly from 122,000 to 128,000 years ago) summer temperatures in Northwest Greenland, where her ice core was extracted, averaged a whopping 11°F warmer than the 20th century average.
Remarkably, she estimated that Greenland only lost 30 per cent of its ice after six millennia. The integrated heat added to the ice over that span was roughly twenty times as much heat as humans could unload on it from greenhouse gases in 500 years, so the Greenland-driven apocalypse just isn’t going to happen.
Dahl-Jensen did note a curious mystery her work had uncovered. It’s well-known, from a number of independent sources, that Eemian sea levels were around twenty feet higher than the current era. Her ice-loss data suggested Greenland could only raise sea levels about one-third of that. The rest of the water had to come from the only other possible source, Antarctica.
The notion of an alarming rise in the ocean coming from there anytime soon has always been difficult to entertain. It is really cold down there and any melting should take a very long time—thousands of years—to do very much.
That just changed. Or at least it just changed in a complex and touchy simulation by Robert DeConto (University of Massachusetts) and David Pollard (Penn State) that made it above-the-fold on the front page of the March 31 New York Times. It seems that they shrunk the time for Antarctica to raise sea levels over ten feet a century from roughly the 50th century, to the 22nd (!).
Before the world gets all On The Beach-y about this, maybe there are devils hiding in the paper’s details. Indeed, there’s a forest of horns hidden in the dense but precise prose published in Nature.
For every predicted climate disaster, there has to be some type of climate model to project future temperatures. The authors used two (one for the ocean and the other for land). The first is a commonly employed general circulation model (GCM) from the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder. The second is a less-common, smaller-scale “Regional Climate Model” (RCM) applied over the continent. These were then input into models of ice dynamics, including a new one that took rainfall (it really doesn’t rain in Antarctica now) and sloshed it into the continent’s huge glaciers, creating gigantic crevasses that crack truly ginormous hunks of ice off into the ocean. The new ice dynamics model is extremely sensitive to the settings of its large variety of handles and knobs—the settings of which can only be guessed at as the physics that the model is built upon is not well developed.
And a predicted disaster is only as reliable as the models that go into it.
The ice dynamics model is in its infancy, and the climate models used to generate temperatures around Antarctica are hot. Way too hot.
According to Andrew Monaghan (Ohio State), writing in Geophysical Research Letters: “20th century (1880–1999) annual Antarctic near-surface air temperature trends in the GCMs are about 2.5-to-5 times larger-than-observed.” Monaghan added this warming: “Until these issues are resolved, IPCC projections for 21st century Antarctic temperature should be regarded with caution.” We’re not sure the press got that memo.
Buried near the bottom of the supplementary material supplied to Nature, we can see that the climate model overproduction of warming infects the DeConto and Pollard paper as well. According to the authors, large areas of the continent (not just the well-known warming of the tiny Antarctic Peninsula that points towards South America) should have warmed some 7-15°F by now (Figure 1, left).
They didn’t. According to Ryan O’Donnell and others writing in the Journal of Climate in 2010, summer temperatures have risen since reliable records begin with the 1957 International Geophysical Year, but only about 5-10 per cent of what the RCM says should have been happening in many spots (Figure 1, right).

Figure 1. (left) Total temperature change between pre-industrial condition and the present produced by the DeConto and Pollard climate model; (right) observed trend (˚C/decade) in temperature from 1957-2006 determined by O’Donnell and colleagues (2011). Multiple the latter by five to get an idea of the total temperature change since 1957.
A good climate disaster also requires some guesstimates of how much carbon dioxide is going to increase in the future. The juiciest ones in the new paper assume atmospheric concentrations that even the United Nations’ has acknowledged as substantial outliers. And the paper lets it increase to eight times over the 19th century background, something no one we know has ever entertained as a basis for future climate scenarios. (We’re currently around four-tenths of the way to a doubling.)
There’s also a scenario where the increase in carbon dioxide is slower and more realistic, and—you guessed it—the end of the world is delayed by several centuries.
Anyway, hit the “send” button and throw all of these models into the computer, and compare to what (we think) happened in the Eemian. It’s there for all to see in the paper’s Figure 3a (our Figure 2): The concatenated models’ gargantuan increases in sea level take place about 1,000 years before they were actually observed.

So there it is. As University of Colorado’s Roger Pielke, Sr., tweeted in response to the paper:

Maybe this is what happens when hypersensitive models are fed unrealistic data.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere at this blog I’ve written often over Germany’s wind energy follies and the mounting opposition to the construction of wind parks. In fact over 300 citizens initiatives against wind energy have sprouted across Germany alone so far.
The reasons for the exploding resistance are many and include destruction of forests, death to wildlife, blighting of the landscape, infrasound causing illnesses, high costs, technical inadequacy and grid instability, to name some. Probably no other product on the planet delivers so much misery for so little common benefit.
Wind energy opposition site “StopTheseThings” writes a couple of reports coming from Europe, which tell us of growing opposition to and serious health problems from wind energy. We are now witnessing how a rogue industry is well past its heyday.
It’s becoming increasingly clear that wind energy has gone from being welcome with open arms, to being furiously opposed. then only things keeping it afloat is special interest, junk science and corruption.

Europe’s citizens getting sick and tired of wind energy, and now even furious. Source: StopTheseThings.

The first here is a report on how the Irish are becoming fed up and furious, and are now demanding an end to “pointless, subsidised wind power”.
The article writes how the industry had been used to getting its way by bulldozing over and marginalizing  opposition and corrupting officials. But that strategy seems to be backfiring now, as StopTheseThings writes that “communities are as angry, if not angrier, than ever about the manner in which wind power outfits have ridden roughshod over their basic human rights – such as the right to sleep, live in and otherwise enjoy their family homes, free from incessant turbine generated low-frequency noise and infrasound – aided and abetted by a political ‘system’ that can be described as ‘crony capitalism’… ”
Recently there was a “monster Dublin protest” where “the leaders of community defence groups from all over Ireland descended on the Dáil Éireann to drive home their message – that wind power is a failed experiment and that these things do not work on any level: social, economic or environmental“.
In Finland StopTheseThings reports here how late last year a comprehensive report was released by the National Association of Citizens Against Giant Windmills warning that wind turbines near residential areas lead to serious health issues. For the report the experiences of 55 people concerning the health impacts were examined. The result: “Out of these 55 people, 33 suffer from sleep disturbances, 26 from ear problems, 23 from headache, 17 from nausea, 11 from heart problems and 11 from inertia“.
The wind industry is facing serious head winds.

"Glaciers have carved some of Earth’s most beautiful landscapes by steepening and deepening valleys through erosion. Think of the Scottish Highlands, Yosemite National Park in the US, or the Norwegian Fjords. But big questions remain about how glacial erosion works. A problem for scientists seeking to understand how glaciers affect the landscape is that the processes of glacial erosion are very complex and not fully understood. For the most part that’s because these processes occur under tens, hundreds or even thousands of metres of ice – we simply can’t observe them.  One mystery is why glaciers erode at different rates. Some glaciers are only able to strip away a hair’s breadth of bedrock each year. Others cut down several centimetres per year, producing huge amounts of sediment that are washed into meltwater streams, lakes or the sea. Knowing what controls glacial erosion is important because it helps us manage human activity in environments with active glaciers. For example, hydropower schemes can become silted up by the sediment that is spat out of glaciers into meltwater streams. Equally, the safe burial of radioactive waste in countries like Finland, Sweden and Switzerland must consider the possibility that glaciers could grow in the future and dig out any such waste.  On geological timescales, glacial erosion even influences climate because the tiny bits of ground-up rock that are generated by glaciers are more susceptible to chemical weathering. Chemical reactions between the glacial sediment and the air remove CO₂ from the atmosphere, which leads to cooling. Our latest research shows that the speed at which glaciers move, and the climate in which glaciers exist, control how quickly they cut downward into bedrock. We often talk about things moving at a glacial pace if they are slow, but actually glaciers can be relatively fast. Some, such as Meserve Glacier in Antarctica, will barely move at all each year, but others, like Jakobshavn Isbrae in Greenland, will move as much as 40m a day.  This huge variability in velocity can explain huge differences in erosion. This makes sense – the faster the glacier moves, the more it drags particles over the bedrock below, wearing and tearing it away. But until now there’s been very little evidence to back this up.  Our study has provided that evidence, showing a strong correlation between sliding velocity and erosion rate for many glaciers. This indicates that velocity is a good predictor of how much erosion a glacier can cause.  But then there’s a bigger question of whether there is something even more fundamental that controls glacier speed and erosion.  Recent research suggested that temperature was that underlying factor. Some glaciers (such as in Iceland or Alaska) are actually pretty warm, with temperatures hovering around the freezing/melting point. Others (say, in Antarctica) may have temperatures several tens of degrees below freezing. If a glacier is frozen to the bedrock then it won’t slide anywhere and can’t cause  much erosion. Conversely, if it can slide freely over the rock then it will cause lots of erosion.  Until now, nobody had looked at the other really important aspect of climate – precipitation – and its influence on erosion. We gathered information from glaciers all round the world and showed that the most erosive glaciers are those that are in relatively warm climates with lots of snowfall such as Alaska. Glaciers in colder climates with hardly any snowfall, such as Antarctica, cause very little erosion.  This link between climate and glacial erosion has long-lasting effects. Take Scotland - a country with spectacular, but contrasting, landscapes that have been carved by multiple ice sheets and glaciers over the past two million years. In the west are the Scottish Highlands with deep and broad glacier-carved valleys, such as Glen Coe. In the east, there are the Cairngorms, with a broad, high-altitude plateau exhibiting less erosion. The glaciers that sculpted these landscapes probably experienced different climates.

      Has Everest's iconic Hillary Step really collapsed? Here's the science


 Today, the west of Scotland is wetter because most of the UK’s weather systems come in from the west. In the east, it’s much drier (and sunnier). At times of glaciation, the glaciers in the west may have experienced a milder climate and higher rates of snowfall. So these glaciers were more dynamic, faster, and were able to cut the beautiful valleys that we see today.  In the Cairngorms, it would have been much colder and drier, so the ice cover was less able to cut deep valleys. In many ways, Scotland owes its beauty to glaciers, variable climate and erosion."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe ocean “acidification” narrative that claims humans are gradually lowering pH levels in sea water with their CO2 emissions may rest on presumptions, hypotheticals, and confirmation bias — not robust, observational scientific evidence.
A paper by Wei et al. (2015) published a year ago in the Journal of Geophysical Research effectively illustrates the vacuousness of the ocean “acidification” paradigm.
In the paper, the authors assert that “model calculations” (yes, calculations from modeling) have indicated oceanic pH levels may have decreased (i.e., lowered pH = less alkaline = more “acidic”) since the 1800s by a total of about 0.1 as consequence of the rise in anthropogenic CO2 emissions.  This overall pH-lowering “trend” of less than 0.1 since the industrial era began is “predicted” to “potentially threaten the existence and development of many marine calcareous organisms”.  Again, it’s the 150-year -0.1 trend in pH-lowering — which the authors admit is subject to “large errors” in measurement — that threatens the oceanic biosphere according to modeled predictions.  In contrast, large natural pH drops of -0.2 to -0.5 occurring on 10-year timescales do not threaten “marine calcareous organisms.”   Here are the key points from the paper:

Wei et al., 2015       Ocean acidification is predicted to reduce the saturation state of carbonate minerals in seawater and potentially threaten the existence and development of many marine calcareous organisms, such as calcareous microorganisms and corals. Model calculations have indicated an overall decrease in global seawater pH of 0.1 relative to the preIndustrial era value, and a further pH reduction of 0.2–0.3 over the next century.
We here estimate the OA rates from the two long (>150 years) annually resolved pH records from the northern SCS (this study) and the northern GBR [Great Barrier Reef], and the results indicate annual rates of -0.00039 +/- 0.00025 yr and -0.00034 +/- 0.00022 yr for the northern SCS [South China Sea] and the northern GBR [Great Barrier Reef], respectively. … [T]hese two time-series do not show significant decreasing trend for pH.  Despite such large errors, estimated from these rates, the seawater pH has decreased by about 0.07–0.08 U over the past 200 years in these regions.   …  The average calculated seawater pH over the past 159 years was 8.04 [with a] a seawater pH variation range of 7.66–8.40.

Below is the “money” graph from the paper that depicts sea surface temperature anomalies (top) and decadal-scale variations ranging between 7.66 and 8.40 in seawater pH (bottom) since the 1850s for the West Pacific Ocean:

First, notice that the Wei et al. (2015) sea surface temperature (SST) graph (top, green font) indicates there has been a rather significant cooling trend in the Western Pacific since the 1980s, and that SSTs are no warmer today than they were in the 1850s.  This is consistent with other reconstructions that show modern SSTs in the region (NW Pacific) may still be a full degree C colder than they were during the Medieval Warm Period, and multiple degrees colder than they were a few thousand years ago (Yamamoto et al., 2016, Rosenthal et al., 2017).
But the bottom graph (red font) of pH variability since the mid-19th century is even more cogent.  Notice that pH levels fluctuate between about 7.7 and 8.4 throughout the 150+ years, with many of the amplitudes found in the rises and falls in pH occurring at rates of + or – 0.2 to 0.5 per decade.  So we are apparently expected to believe that changes in pH of + or – 0.2 to 0.5 per decade are not dangerous or “predicted” to “potentially threaten the existence and development of many marine calcareous organisms”, but the overall “acidic” or pH-lowering “trend” of less than -0.1 over 150 years is supposed to be dangerous to the oceanic biosphere.   Below is an annotated version of this same graph brandishing this flagrant contradiction.

Daniel Cressey, who has previously helped expose a growing corruption problem infecting the scientific community, recently summarized the state of research on ocean “acidificaton” for the prestigious scientific journal Nature.  He poignantly states that the lack of skepticism and an eager willingness to just accept the presumptions of others based upon their authoritative status (“groupthink”) may have “damage[d] the credibility of the ocean sciences”.   And once scientific credibility is damaged, it becomes very difficult to earn that credibility back.

Cressey (2015)       The state of the world’s seas is often painted as verging on catastrophe. But although some challenges are very real, others have been vastly overstated, researchers claim in a review paper. The team writes that scientists, journals and the media have fallen into a mode of groupthink that can damage the credibility of the ocean sciences. The controversial study exposes fault lines in the marine-science community.   Carlos Duarte, a marine biologist at the University of Western Australia in Perth, and his colleagues say that gloomy media reports about ocean issues such as invasive species and coral die-offs are not always based on actual observations. It is not just journalists who are to blame, they maintain: the marine research community “may not have remained sufficiently sceptical” on the topic.

Scientists Find Higher CO2, Lowered pH Levels (‘Acidification’) Have Little To No Effect On Ocean-Dwelling Organisms
Scientists continue to construct experiments testing the effects of highly elevated CO2 (usually with volumes several times modern levels) on sea-living creatures.  They routinely find that higher CO2 levels (and higher sea temperatures) have little to no effect on growth rates or survival for the species tested.  In fact, it has been found in some cases that elevated CO2 benefits ocean-dwelling organisms, meaning that they thrive and prosper in these conditions.  Obviously, these scientific studies wholly undermine the paradigm that envisions the long-term survival of the oceanic biosphere is jeopardized by rising anthropogenic CO2 emissions.

Uthicke et al., 2016       Near the vent site, the urchins experienced large daily variations in pH (> 1 unit) andpCO2 (> 2000 ppm) and average pH values (pHT 7.73) much below those expected under the most pessimistic future emission scenarios. Growth was measured over a 17-month period using tetracycline tagging of the calcareous feeding lanterns. Average-sized urchins grew more than twice as fast at the vent compared with those at an adjacent control site, and assumed larger sizes at the vent compared to the control site and two other sites at another reef near-by. … Thus, urchins did not only persist but actually ‘thrived’ under extreme CO2 conditions.

Vicente et al., 2016       The long-term exposure experiments revealed no effect on survival or growth rates of M. grandis to high pCO2 (1198 µatm), warmer temperatures (25.6°C), or combined high pCO2 with warmer temperature (1225 µatm, 25.7°C) treatments, indicating that M. grandis will continue to prosper under predicted increases in pCO2 and sea surface temperature. 

Moore, 2016       If the forecasts of continued global warming are borne out, the oceans will also become warmer and will tend to outgas CO2, offsetting to some extent the small increased partial pressure that might otherwise occur. … An analysis of research on the effect of lower pH shows a net beneficial impact on the calcification, metabolism, growth, fertility, and survival of calcifying marine species when pH is lowered up to 0.3 units, which is beyond what is considered a plausible reduction during this century. … There is no evidence to support the claim that most calcifying marine species will become extinct owing to higher levels of CO2 in the atmosphere and lower pH in the oceans.

Hildebrandt et al., 2016       Elevated pCO2 did not directly affect grazing activities and body mass, suggesting that the copepods did not have additional energy demands for coping with acidification, neither during long-term exposure nor after immediate changes in pCO2. Shifts in seawater pH thus do not seem to challenge these copepod species.

Cross et al., 2016       A CO2 perturbation experiment was performed on the New Zealand terebratulide brachiopod Calloria inconspicua to investigate the effects of pH conditions predicted for 2050 and 2100 on the growth rate and ability to repair shell. Three treatments were used: an ambient pH control (pH 8.16), a mid-century scenario (pH 7.79), and an end-century scenario (pH 7.62). The ability to repair shell was not affected by acidified conditions with >80% of all damaged individuals at the start of the experiment completing shell repair after 12 weeks. Growth rates in undamaged individuals >3 mm in length were also not affected by lowered pH conditions.

Heinrich et al., 2016       In this study, we tested the effects of elevated CO2 on the foraging and shelter-seeking behaviours of the reef-dwelling epaulette shark, Hemiscyllium ocellatum. Juvenile sharks were exposed for 30 d to control CO2 (400 µatm) and two elevated CO2 treatments (615 and 910 µatm), consistent with medium- and high-end projections for ocean pCO2 by 2100. Contrary to the effects observed in teleosts and in some other sharks, behaviour of the epaulette shark was unaffected by elevated CO2.

Sunjin and Jetfelt, 2016       [A]n increasing number of studies show tolerance of fish to increased levels of carbon dioxide. … We investigated the possible effects of CO2 on behavioural lateralization, swimming activity, and prey and predator olfactory preferences, all behaviours where disturbances have previously been reported in other fish species after exposure to elevated CO2. Interestingly, we failed to detect effects of carbon dioxide for most behaviours investigated.

Schram et al., 2016       There were no significant temperature or pH effects on growth, net calcification, shell morphologies, or proximate body composition of snails. Our findings suggest that both gastropod species demonstrate resilience to initial exposure to temperature and pH changes predicted to occur over the next several hundred years globally and perhaps sooner along the WAP.

Brien et al., 2016       Corals were collected from reefs around Orpheus and Pelorus Islands on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. They were then exposed to elevated pCO2 for 4 weeks with two CO2 treatments: intermediate (pCO2 648) and high (pCO2 1003) compared with a control (unmanipulated seawater) treatment (pCO2 358). Porites cylindrica growth did not vary among pCO2 treatments, regardless of the presence and type of competitors, nor was the growth of another hard coral species, Acropora cerealis, affected by pCO2 treatment. 

Zhang et al., 2016       The present study investigated the physiological responses (ingestion, absorption rate and efficiency, respiration, and excretion) and scope for growth (SfG) of an intertidal scavenging gastropod, Nassarius festivus, to the combined effects of ocean acidification (pCO2 levels: 380, 950, and 1250 µatm), salinity (10 and 30 psu), and temperature (15 and 30°C) for 31 d. [E]levated pCO2 levels had no effects in isolation on all physiological parameters and only weak interactions with temperature and/or salinity for excretion and SfG. In conclusion, elevated pCO2will not affect the energy budget of adult N. festivus at the pCO2 level predicted to occur by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in the year 2300.

Wang et al., 2016       The pMENs results were in line with the null hypothesis that elevated pCO2/pH does not affect biogeochemistry processes. The number of nodes within the pMENs and the connectivity of the bacterial communities were similar, despite increased pCO2 concentrations. Our results indicate that elevated pCO2 did not significantly affect microbial community structure and succession in the Arctic Ocean, suggesting bacterioplankton community resilience to elevated pCO2.

Pančić et al., 2015       The effects of ocean acidification and increased temperature on physiology of six strains of the polar diatom Fragilariopsis cylindrusfrom Greenland were investigated. Experiments were performed under manipulated pH levels (8.0, 7.7, 7.4, and 7.1) and different temperatures (1, 5, and 8 °C) to simulate changes from present to plausible future levels. … By combining increased temperature and acidification, the two factors counterbalanced each other, and therefore no effect on the growth rates was found.

Wall et al., 2015       Cold-water corals are important habitat formers in deep-water ecosystems and at high latitudes. Ocean acidification and the resulting change in aragonite saturation are expected to affect these habitats and impact coral growth. Counter to expectations, the deep water coral Lophelia pertusa has been found to be able to sustain growth even in undersaturated conditions. … Skeletal morphology is highly variable but shows no distinctive differences between natural and low pH conditions. … We suggest that as long as the energy is available to sustain the up-regulation, i.e. individuals are well fed, there is no detrimental effect to the skeletal morphology.

Oceanic Microbes Routinely Endure Water Temperature Extremes That Exceed (Modeled) Future Warming Changes
According to climate models, sea surface temperatures are expected to rise dramatically during the next century due to the rise in anthropogenic CO2 emissions.  Doblin and van Sebille (2016), however, point out that upper-ocean microbes routinely travel through (and thrive in) waters that vary in range by up to 10°C more than they do from one seasonal extreme to another (i.e., winter vs. summer), and thus the predicted warming of near surface ocean waters will not even be close to the extreme temperature variations these organism routinely endure.

Doblin and van Sebille, 2016       Here we show that upper-ocean microbes experience along-trajectory temperature variability up to 10 °C greater than seasonal fluctuations estimated in a static frame, and that this variability depends strongly on location. These findings demonstrate that drift in ocean currents can increase the thermal exposure of microbes and suggests that microbial populations with broad thermal tolerance will survive transport to distant regions of the ocean and invade new habitats.

[press release]        The results of the study … show for the first time the range of temperatures that plankton travel through. In most locations, they endure temperature extremes that go beyond what is predicted by models of global warming.

Corals Naturally Adapt To Elevated CO2, Water Temperature; Their Long-Term Survival Is Not Threatened
Somehow corals were able to evolve and survive and thrive — avoiding extinction — during periods when atmospheric CO2 concentrations were several times higher than now, and when sea water temperatures were multiple degrees C warmer than now.  And yet those advocating the ocean “acidification” narrative claim that corals are not longer able to adapt to the modern (tiny) temperature and CO2 changes that have occurred in recent decades.  Scientists, meanwhile, have found that corals are quite resilient, and can adapt quickly to large environmental changes well beyond the range of recent and projected climatic conditions.

Prada et al., 2016       Our study suggests that populations of Orbicella species [corals] are capable of rebounding from reductions in population size under suitable conditions and that the effective population size of modern corals provides rich standing genetic variation for corals to adapt to climate change.

Matz et al., 2015       Heat tolerance in corals can be passed down the generations, suggesting that corals can adapt as the climate warms.

Georgiou et al., 2015       The FOCE experiment was designed to simulate the effects of CO2-driven acidification predicted to occur by the end of this century (scenario RCP4.5) while simultaneously maintaining the exposure of corals to natural variations in their environment under in situ conditions. Analyses of skeletal growth (measured from extension rates and skeletal density) showed no systematic differences between low-pH FOCE treatments (Δ pH=∼−0.05 to−0.25 units below ambient) and present day controls (ΔpH=0) for calcification rates or the pH of the calcifying fluid (pH cf) … [C]oral living in highly dynamic environments exert strong physiological controls on the carbonate chemistry of their calcifying fluid, implying a high degree of resilience to ocean acidification within the investigated ranges.

Corals Are A Net Source Of CO2, For They Release CO2 As They Grow And Thrive; ‘Acidification’ A Sign Of Healthy Corals
Scientists have found that higher “acidification” levels (lower pH) in the vicinity of coral communities are indication that the corals are thriving and growing.  Why?  Because corals produce their own “acidification” by releasing more CO2 than they absorb.  They are a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere.

McGowan et al., 2016        Here we present by way of case study the first direct measurements of air-sea CO2 exchange over a coral reef made using the eddy covariance method. Research was conducted during the summer monsoon over a lagoonal platform reef in the southern Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Results show the reef flat to be a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere of similar magnitude as coastal lakes, while adjacent shallow and deep lagoons were net sinks as was the surrounding ocean. This heterogeneity in CO2 exchange with the atmosphere confirms need for spatially representative direct measurements of CO2 over coral reefs to accurately quantify their role in atmospheric carbon budgets.

Yeakel et al., 2015       Our results reveal that coral reefs undergo natural interannual events of rapid acidification due to shifts in reef biogeochemical processes that may be linked to offshore productivity and ultimately controlled by larger-scale climatic and oceanographic processes.

[press release]       More acidic water may be a sign of healthy corals, says a new study, muddying the waters still further on our understanding of how coral reefs might react to climate change. … Andreas Andersson of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, California, and his colleagues carefully monitored a coral reef in Bermuda for five years, and found that spikes in acidity were linked to increased reef growth. … The researchers observed the chemistry of the water on the reef between 2007 and 2012. During that time, there were two sharp spikes in acidity – once in 2010 and again in 2011. The team found that coral growth itself made the water more acidic as the corals sucked alkaline carbonate out of the water to build their skeletons. The corals also ate more food during these high-activity periods and pumped more CO2 into the water, increasing acidity further.

More Than 90% Of Ocean pH Changes (‘Acidification’) Caused By Natural Variability, Not Anthropogenic CO2
Finally, the assumption that changes in the oceans’ pH levels are primarily caused by humans is just that: a non-confirmed assumption.  As Duarte et al. (2015) conclude, there is “no robust evidence for realized severe disruptions of marine socioecological links from ocean acidification to anthropogenic CO2”.  Possibly the only people who still “believe” in the paradigm are those who are inclined to accept doomsday scenarios and those who are being financially compensated to keep them going.

Goodkin et al., 2015      Here we reconstruct 222 years of biennial seawater pH variability in the Sargasso Sea from a brain coral, Diploria labyrinthiformis. Using hydrographic data from the Bermuda Atlantic Time-Series Study (BATS) and the coral derived pH record, we are able to differentiate pH changes due to surface temperature versus those from ocean circulation and biogeochemical changes. We find that ocean pH does not simply reflect atmospheric CO2 trends, but rather that circulation/biogeochemical changes account for >90% of pH variability in the Sargasso Sea and more variability in the last century than would be predicted from anthropogenic uptake of CO2 alone.

Duarte et al., 2015       [T]he link between these declines and ocean acidification through anthropogenic CO2 is unclear.  Corrosive waters affecting oysters in hatcheries along the Oregon coast were associated with upwelling (Barton et  al. 2012), not anthropogenic CO2. The decline in pH affecting oysters in Chesapeake Bay (Waldbusser et al. 2011) was not attributable to anthropogenic CO2 but was likely attributable to excess respiration associated with eutrophication. Therefore, there is, as yet, no robust evidence for realized severe disruptions of marine socioecological links from ocean acidification to anthropogenic CO2, and there are significant uncertainties regarding the level of pH change that would prompt such impacts. …  A number of biases internal and external to the scientific community contribute to perpetuating the perception of ocean calamities in the absence of robust evidence.

"LOS ANGELES  —   Oscar voters showered the   “La La Land” with 14 nominations on Tuesday, a tie with “Titanic” and “All About Eve” for the most in Academy Award history. But the academy also moved past two #OscarsSoWhite years by honoring six black actors  —   a record  —   and including diverse films like “Moonlight,” “Fences” and “Hidden Figures” in the best picture race. [ The list of nominees | Where to stream them | Nominees react | Who got snubbed?] “It makes me feel good to see such a multifaceted group of people get recognized,” said Barry Jenkins, the director of “Moonlight,” which received eight nominations. Speaking by phone from Amsterdam, where he was promoting the film, he added, “It’s an affirmation that film has the power to erode barriers and reveal what makes us all human. ” Nine movies, most of them cobbled together outside the studio system, will compete for Hollywood’s top prize. Filling out the best picture race are “Arrival,” a   thriller the    drama “Hell or High Water” “Manchester by the Sea,” about a mournful New England handyman the subtitled   “Lion” and “Hacksaw Ridge,” Mel Gibson’s true story of World War II heroism. In a surprise, Mr. Gibson also drew a nomination as best director, officially ending his   status as a Hollywood pariah for his offscreen behavior. Joining him in the directing field were Damien Chazelle (“La La Land”) Denis Villeneuve (“Arrival”) Mr. Jenkins (“Moonlight”) and Kenneth Lonergan (“Manchester by the Sea”). Perhaps the biggest upset happened in the best actress category. “Arrival” emerged as one of the most honored films, with support in eight categories, but its star, Amy Adams, failed to receive a nod for best actress. Even worse, a website managed by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and ABC, which broadcasts the Oscars, initially listed her as a nominee. ABC took the blame, citing a rush to post names. “We apologize to the academy, press and fans for any confusion,” the network said in a statement. ABC also mistakenly named Tom Hanks as a best actor candidate for “Sully. ” In excluding Ms. Adams, whose performance has been honored by numerous other awards groups, academy voters backed Isabelle Huppert from the French film “Elle,” Emma Stone from “La La Land,” Natalie Portman from “Jackie,” Meryl Streep from “Florence Foster Jenkins” and the newcomer Ruth Negga from “Loving. ” It was Ms. Streep’s 20th career nomination her speech about Donald J. Trump at the Golden Globes probably won her some votes. (She reacted to her inclusion by releasing a happy dance GIF.) Several other legends were snubbed. Voters refused to throw Martin Scorsese’s   bomb “Silence” a lifeline, offering a lone nod for cinematography. And Clint Eastwood’s “Sully” had to make do with one nomination, for sound editing. Once again, the academy stubbornly refused to bow toward popular movies the   “Deadpool” received nothing, even in    categories. As expected  —   and despite renewed attention on   lawsuits that he settled in 2010  —   Casey Affleck, the star of “Manchester by the Sea,” continued his march toward the Oscar podium. He will vie for best actor alongside Denzel Washington (“Fences”) Andrew Garfield (“Hacksaw Ridge”) Ryan Gosling (“La La Land”) and Viggo Mortensen (“Captain Fantastic”). In a sharp contrast to the previous two years, when the academy put forward   rosters of acting nominees, voters chose the largest number of black candidates ever. Mahershala Ali and Naomie Harris each received a nod for their supporting work in “Moonlight,” a poetic drama about a young black man in Miami. Viola Davis (“Fences”) and Octavia Spencer (“Hidden Figures”) were also nominated for supporting actress. Joining Ms. Negga in the lead categories was Mr. Washington of “Fences,” an adaptation of August Wilson’s classic play about black life in 1950s Pittsburgh. Another minority actor, Dev Patel, was nominated for his supporting role in “Lion,” which received six nominations in total, tying “Manchester by the Sea” and “Hacksaw Ridge. ” And four of the five honored documentaries came from black filmmakers, including “13th,” Ava DuVernay’s searing look at race and mass incarceration in America, and “I Am Not Your Negro,” directed by Raoul Peck, a portrait of the writer James Baldwin and the   era. (The others in that race are “Fire at Sea,” “Life, Animated” and the   “O. J.: Made in America,” which paves the way for TV documentaries given limited theatrical release to be nominees.) Pundits will inevitably declare that the academy listened to the #OscarsSoWhite protests that found the Rev. Al Sharpton berating Hollywood in a preceremony rally last year. The academy made drastic membership changes in 2016, revoking the voting privileges of   members and inviting more women and minorities to join. (The   group remains overwhelmingly white and male, however.) Public pressure may have been a factor in the outcome on Tuesday, but the results almost assuredly have more to do with the vagaries of moviemaking: a full slate of   movies with diverse casts that coalesced in the past year. Still, race continues to be a   topic around the Oscars. Last week, one academy voter, Santiago Pozo, voiced brewing discontent among Latinos, writing in the trade publication Deadline. com that underrepresentation of other minorities in Hollywood  —   not just black actors  —   is “a terminal illness for our business and for the relevance of the Academy Awards. ” The Los Angeles Times weighed in with a similar editorial on Tuesday, noting that there were almost no Hispanic nominees. One exception:   Miranda received a nod for his original “Moana” song “How Far I’ll Go,” putting him one step closer to the rarefied club known as EGOT: those who have won an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony. (Mr. Miranda, a   Oscar nominee, already has an Emmy, two Grammys and three Tonys.) Among companies, Amazon was a big winner on Tuesday, beating Netflix to become the first streaming service to earn an Academy Award nomination for best picture. Amazon bought “Manchester by the Sea” at last year’s Sundance Film Festival. With 26, Lionsgate received the most nominations of any studio its contenders include “La La Land” and “Hell or High Water,” a partnership with CBS Films. The Oscars will be broadcast on Feb. 26. Jimmy Kimmel, who anchors ABC’s   programming block, will host. The academy entrusted its previous ceremony to the producers Reginald Hudlin and David Hill, who brought in Chris Rock to scold Hollywood on diversity and created a    scrawl in an   attempt to make acceptance speeches more interesting. Ratings dropped, and ABC, which charges more than $2 million for a   commercial, moved to take a firmer hand in this year’s telecast."
"Tropical peat swamps are not only the native habitat of orangutans and sun bears, they’re also one of the world’s most important ecosystems. Found commonly in warm countries, including Malaysia and Indonesia, the world’s tropical peat forests suck carbon dioxide out of our atmosphere, storing it in the peat and limiting the concentration of warming gases in our atmosphere.  But since the 1990s, swamp forests have been destroyed for agricultural use, usually to produce palm oil – a cheap vegetable oil used in food, cosmetics and biofuels. Because palm oil trees can’t grow in wet, swampy conditions, plantation owners clear the swamp, then drain the area until it is unrecognisable from its original state.  So far, our research found that 3 million hectares of tropical peat swamp forests in Malaysia and Indonesia have been replaced by palm oil plantations. Even as you read this article, new areas are being cleared at record rates. This is a serious problem – once the swamp dries out, the long-stored peat is rapidly converted to greenhouse gases.  Our research investigated how the process of converting a peat swamp forest to a palm oil plantation contributes to global greenhouse gas emissions. We found that gas emissions resulting from the conversion of palm oil plantations in south-east Asia is up to 0.8% of total global greenhouse gas emissions. This is the equivalent of almost half that of global aviation emissions. Our team carried out field measures in a swamp in North Selangor, Malaysia. We wanted to know the amount and type of greenhouse gases released at different stages of the conversion process, from swamp to plantation. Knowing the type of greenhouse gas is important, as some have a greater effect on the climate than others. For example, nitrous oxide – which is produced by bacteria in soil – is nearly 300 times more damaging than carbon dioxide. After collecting our measurements, we then used satellite data to calculate what percentage of south-east Asia’s emissions are caused by palm oil plantations. Our data shows that palm oil plantations on peatland contribute between 16.6% and 27.9% of total greenhouse gas emissions from Malaysia and Indonesia. Astonishingly this is between 0.44% and 0.74% of annual global emissions. Changing land use policies for peat swamp forests will be critical for reducing national greenhouse gas emissions in Malaysia and Indonesia.  Our research also identified when these greenhouse gases are released in the land conversion process, which was previously unknown. Our data shows the highest emissions are produced by new plantations (up to five years old) that have a young palm oil crop – more than double the emissions produced by mature ones. This is because there is more food for microbes to feed on when the land has only recently been converted from a swamp.  Once the most easily accessible nutrients and carbon are lost, the microorganisms have less food to convert to greenhouse gases so emissions are lower in older plantations. In order to get a true measure of greenhouse gas emissions produced by deforestation and plantations, we must measure across the full life cycle of the plantation – otherwise we can miss the highest emissions.  Converting other forests around the world into palm oil plantations poses a serious risk. The potential contribution of these areas to global heating is large – perhaps even worse than emissions from global aviation. Prohibiting further agriculture on tropical peatland environments is crucial in the race to mitigate against rapid climate warming.  But this is not often easy. People living in these forest areas are mostly poor and face serious economic challenges – and palm oil plantations can provide income. And once a swamp has been cleared, it will take millennia for the carbon to be stored back in the ground, even if the forest were restored. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter.

"It’s been more than two decades since Britain’s retail electricity market was opened to full competition in 1999. Before that, retail supply was provided by state-owned entities with regional monopolies. Today, all consumers, including households and businesses, are able to “shop around” for their electricity, switching to a different supplier or tariff to take advantage of better prices and services.     In principle, that is exactly what liberalised retail markets are supposed to provide: greater consumer choice and protections. But that’s only the case if it’s easy for consumers to switch suppliers and for new suppliers to enter the market. That’s how markets are supposed to stay competitive to deliver low prices and a high quality of service. That was the great hope of electricity policy in 1999, but after two decades, there’s little to celebrate. 


      Read more:
      Fact Check: are fewer people switching gas or electricity company?


 To enhance competition, smaller suppliers have been exempt from contributing towards the cost of decarbonisation policies. Known as “the threshold obligation”, this encouraged the entry of smaller companies into Britain’s retail electricity market, but the increase from six suppliers in 1999 to more than 70 in 2019 came at a cost. Many new suppliers have gone bankrupt due to unsustainable business models, resulting in consumers footing unpaid industry bills. The retail market is designed for a tech-savvy, informed consumer, who actively switches suppliers to benefit from a cheaper tariff. But over 50% of British consumers are on the default “standard variable tariff”, which is the most expensive. This implies that most people are passive consumers, and don’t shop around at all. While suppliers that are exempt from the threshold obligation can offer lower tariffs, these only tend to benefit active consumers who seek out and switch to them. These consumers tend to be better off anyway, with better access to information and the time to compare choices. The costs of decarbonisation and social policies are eventually recovered through electricity bills, so passive consumers end up bearing a disproportionate proportion of these costs. This has sparked debate about how to protect passive consumers from retailers who charge them more than others for the same service. In January 2019, the energy market regulator, Ofgem, put a cap on the price of default tariffs to prevent disengaged consumers being exploited. But this won’t work if the barriers to switching remain in place. At the moment, consumers can’t easily access information about different electricity suppliers, and the market is so complex that they don’t feel confident to switch even if they wanted to. Not only has the retail market failed to achieve its original objectives for consumers, it also hasn’t kept pace with technological change and the need to  transition away from fossil fuels. Since 1999, the electricity sector has undergone a transformation. Consumers can now generate their own electricity through solar panels and sell it back to the grid.  There are companies that aggregate smaller consumers into groups and buy and sell electricity on their behalf. Community energy services allow local communities to collectively own a renewable energy project such as a wind farm and generate, store, consume and sell their own energy. There are multi-service providers that don’t just sell electricity, but internet and telephone access too. These business models are possible today but were unthinkable in 1999.

      Despite good progress, 100% low-carbon energy is still a long way off for the UK


 Existing market regulations prevent these new services from being brought into the market by new players, because their business models aren’t aligned with traditional electricity suppliers and the existing system. If one of these new providers wanted to offer consumers free electricity with the purchase of an electric vehicle, this might require a consumer to have more than one supplier for the same premises – one which supplies electricity to the vehicle and another that satisfies the rest of the consumer’s demand. But at the moment, you’re only allowed one supplier as your single point of access to the retail market. Regulations need to keep pace with this transformation. With the growth of “prosumers” – people who generate their energy as well as buying some – the electricity market is changing. Top-down structures in which traditional suppliers act as the primary liaison may no longer be the dominant model in the future. As the cost of solar panels and battery storage falls, more people will take to generating their own energy, and the electricity system will become more decentralised. That means more power and control for consumers over their own energy use and bills.  But in order for everyone to benefit, the government should reconsider its current policy of funding renewable energy projects through an extra fee on electricity tariffs. Tariffs are charged based on how much electricity someone buys from the grid. A prosumer, with rooftop solar panels that generate their own electricity, needs to buy less energy from the grid, resulting in higher prices for remaining consumers.  Britain’s retail electricity market has changed beyond recognition in the last 20 years. Energy policy has to catch up, and fast, to meet the urgent challenges of decarbonisation and fuel poverty."

"Mr Rudd has woken up that Penny’s Ration-and-Tax (RAT) Scheme will destroy jobs.
But instead of killing the RAT Scheme, he proposes a massive carbon subsidy to offset the job destruction caused by the carbon tax.
Kevin and Malcolm need to make up their minds.
If they want to cut the production of harmless carbon dioxide, it MUST cause job losses in coal, power generation, cement, steel, farming and tourism.
But if job protection is important to them, they should abandon the RAT scheme immediately and concentrate on important matters.
Fiddling with it, achieves neither goal.
As for the subsidy, Kevin needs reminding that the money we get from Canberra is the money we sent to Canberra, less handling charges both ways.
A tax and subsidy policy always replaces real jobs in regional industry with fake jobs in the money laundering departments in Canberra.

"The owner of Persil, Domestos and Cif is to invest €1bn in eliminating fossil fuel-based ingredients from its cleaning products by 2030. Unilever’s “clean future” initiative aims to develop renewable or recycled alternatives to chemicals derived from the oil industry as part of the company’s pledge to eliminate carbon emissions from its products by 2039. The investment in research and development for eco-products comes on top of €1bn Unilever has already committed over the next decade for environmental projects that will improve the “health of the planet”. The company, which owns more than 400 brands including Marmite, Dove, Comfort and Sure, has also pledged to reduce the mountain of plastic rubbish that its products generate. With nearly half of the carbon footprint of the consumer goods giant’s cleaning products coming from oil-based ingredients, reformulating with eco-friendly alternatives is expected to reduce their environmental impact by up to a fifth. A whole “rainbow” of alternatives, varying from well-established palm oil-based chemicals to those derived from algae, plastic waste and carbon captured from energy production, is being investigated.  Peter ter Kulve, Unilever’s president of home care, said it was essential to investigate a diverse range of alternatives to “grow within the limits of our planet”. He said that Unilever hoped that by sharing details of its “carbon rainbow” – outlining the different possible alternatives for sourcing fossil fuel-based ingredients – Unilever was “calling on an economy-wide transformation”. “A new bioeconomy is rising from the ashes of fossil fuels,” he said. “We’ve heard time and time again that people want more affordable sustainable products that are just as good as conventional ones. Rapid developments in science and technology are allowing us to do this, with the promise of exciting new benefits for the people who use our products, from ultra-mild cleaning ingredients to self-cleaning clothes and surfaces.” This week, one of the first innovations will hit shelves in the UK: a Persil washing liquid including a stain remover derived from sugar cane. The Persil bottle will also now be made with 50% recycled plastic and has been redesigned to use less plastic, reducing the total virgin plastic by 1,000 tonnes per year. Cif cleaning liquid on sale in the UK is also to be reformulated with a cleaning agent derived from recycled plastic bottles. Meanwhile in southern India, Unilever is sourcing soda ash – an ingredient in laundry powders – made using a pioneering technology that captures carbon from energy production. Madhu Rao, head of home cleaning products at Unilever, said that the company intended to transform existing well-established brands around the world to make them more sustainable, bringing lower carbon alternatives into the mainstream. “We are on a big journey and this is the starting point,” he said. Rao said Unilever continued to see an “unprecedented level of demand” for health and hygiene products around the world during the pandemic as families spend more time cleaning and disinfecting their homes as they try to fend off the virus. But he said: “The heightened awareness around cleanness doesn’t take away the crisis everybody feels today – the climate crisis. The battle of our lifetime is climate change and consumers are very focused on this. Two-thirds of consumers want to buy more sustainable products and packaging that is sustainable.”"

I have found a 44-year cycle of heavy snowfall in Japan caused by a wavy jet stream, corresponding to Dalton and Gleissberg Minimum as follows [Kimoto, 2010].
1. 1833/heavy snowfall – Dalton Minimum (1795-1830)
2. 1877 heavy snowfall (44 years later)
3. 1918/heavy snowfall: Gleissberg Minimum (1898-1923) – 41 years later
4. 1963/heavy snowfall (45 years later)
5. 2006/heavy snowfall, Dalton or Gleissberg minimum (43 years later)
The heavy snowfall events have all occurred with sharp decline in the aa- index of geomagnetism as shown by four upward arrows in Fig.1. Two downward arrows show trough of geomagnetic activity in 1902 and 1912 associated with the events in which the planet Jupiter (JU), the center of mass of solar system (CM) and the Sun’s center (CS) are in line [Landsheidt, 1988].

Fig. 1: Yearly mean aa-index of geomagnetism.
Therefore, I estimate a probability of coming solar minimum as follows in Fig. 2.:
– Maunder minimum（1645-1715）（probability: 20%）

In 1988, Bucha showed decreased solar activity causes a wavy jet stream along with low aa-index of geomagnetism in line with my findings above.

"On the Channel 4 documentary Apocalyse Cow: How meat killed the planet, British environmentalist and vegan George Monbiot presented the UK as stripped of woodland by grass-eating sheep, crowded with the “agricultural sprawl” of industrial farms, and with streams polluted by manure. Monbiot insisted that the British countryside isn’t a picturesque escape, but an ongoing ecological disaster. The way food is grown in most parts of the world creates these conditions, which harm wildlife and restrain natural habitats. In its place, Monbiot offers possible solutions. Some, we are told, look rather like science fiction. Visiting a Welsh farm, Monbiot meets livestock farmer turned cultured meat entrepreneur, Illtud Dunsford. Instead of rearing animals to be slaughtered for meat, Dunsford is now working on growing meat using animal cells. A Finnish biotech company that Monbiot visits can also create flour and other foodstuffs using bacteria.  Monbiot’s vision is that vast herds of methane-producing cows may no longer be necessary to meet the world’s appetite for food, helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from farming. If most of the food we eat could be grown in a lab, he argues, then a fraction of the space currently reserved for farming would be needed. With characteristic zeal, Monbiot asserts that huge tracts of Earth’s surface, instead of being carefully maintained to grow food, could be returned to natural habitat like forests, meadows and marshes.

      Climate crisis: the countryside could be our greatest ally – if we can reform farming


 My interest here is cultured meat. I’m a sociologist and have spent 12 years documenting the politics and culture of the people working in this industry: people like Dunsford, the CEO of Cellular Agriculture Ltd, who I have occasionally worked with. He moved away from his career as a livestock farmer after travelling South America and seeing deforestation in the Amazon.  It was an “emotional experience” for Dunsford, as he recalled in the documentary: My personal choices here, as a farmer in Wales, had a direct correlation with the crops that were being grown in Brazil. Dunsford returned to the UK and became a leading figure in the UK cultured meat sector. Working with the University of Bath, he showed Monbiot a small work-in-progress bioreactor, used for growing animal muscle cells. As Monbiot noted, to some this is Frankenstein food. Dunsford himself admitted that it took a while for him to adjust too. “Anything that’s alien to you can be slightly scary,” he said. Dunsford’s story is unusual. The dual identity of a livestock farmer turned cultured meat entrepreneur captures a tension in the politics of lab-grown food. Many cultured meat companies have no link to conventional farming. Most are rooted in a venture capitalist tech culture that grew out of Silicon Valley and many companies – including New Age Meats, Finless Foods, and Mission Barns – are located within the San Francisco Bay Area. The same day Apocalypse Cow was screened, Monbiot published a Guardian opinion piece in which he described this as “farmfree food” that “will allow us to hand back vast areas of land and sea to nature”. The relationship between traditional farming and the cultured meat industry has been tricky to balance. On one level, as Monbiot suggests, the aim is to replace industrial animal farming. On another, the cultured meat community has been careful not to exclude farmers entirely, with some insisting that cultured meat can broaden the “protein portfolio” alongside livestock. Some entrepreneurs suggest cultured meat factories could be hosted on farms that grow plant-based input materials, or that farmers could rear animals (potentially from rare breeds) as cell donors. Notions like Monbiot’s farmfree food undermine the work of keeping farmers on board. 


      Read more:
      How gardeners are reclaiming agriculture from industry, one seed at a time


 Monbiot also advocates making cultured meat technology free from patents, to allow the widest possible distribution of ownership. This, he argues: could break the hegemony of the massive companies that now control global food commodities. This idea sits uncomfortably with the start-up culture surrounding much of the cultured meat industry. Many patents have already been filed. Some in the industry, such as charity and research funding organisation New Harvest, align with Monbiot’s approach of patent-free open source technology. For others, the idea of giving up intellectual property rights is difficult to contemplate, as selling or licensing technology forms part of potential business plans. The issue of whether to be with or against global food giants is another strategic difference between Monbiot and the main approach of the cultured meat industry. Many in the sector see the technology’s route to success through a business-savvy market-based approach, as opposed to fighting against big agriculture or undermining agricultural capitalism, as Monbiot prefers. Closing the show, Monbiot describes how increasing deer numbers prevent trees taking root in the Scottish countryside, as he joins a hunt to shoot (and then, it seems, eat) a wild deer. The exercise is intended to control deer for the benefit of the local ecology, allowing forests to return and rewild the landscape, free from the voracious appetite of deer. Across the documentary, Monbiot may have antagonised many viewers, including potential allies. Certainly livestock farmers, but also possibly vegans. And perhaps also some in the cultured meat community, who in general will appreciate his positive message, but be less keen on how he positions cultured meat in strong opposition to farming, and repudiates a possible route to profit."

Global warming alarmists claim vindication after last year’s data manipulation scandal. Don’t believe the ‘independent’ reviews.



Last November there was a world‐​wide outcry when a trove of emails were released suggesting some of the world’s leading climate scientists engaged in professional misconduct, data manipulation and jiggering of both the scientific literature and climatic data to paint what scientist Keith Briffa called “a nice, tidy story” of climate history. The scandal became known as Climategate.



Now a supposedly independent review of the evidence says, in effect, “nothing to see here.” Last week “The Independent Climate Change E‐​mails Review,” commissioned and paid for by the University of East Anglia, exonerated the University of East Anglia. The review committee was chaired by Sir Muir Russell, former vice chancellor at the University of Glasgow.



Mr. Russell took pains to present his committee, which consisted of four other academics, as independent. He told the _Times of London_ that “Given the nature of the allegations it is right that someone who has no links to either the university or the climate science community looks at the evidence and makes recommendations based on what they find.”



No links? One of the panel’s four members, Prof. Geoffrey Boulton, was on the faculty of East Anglia’s School of Environmental Sciences for 18 years. At the beginning of his tenure, the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) — the source of the Climategate emails — was established in Mr. Boulton’s school at East Anglia. Last December, Mr. Boulton signed a petition declaring that the scientists who established the global climate records at East Anglia “adhere to the highest levels of professional integrity.”



This purportedly independent review comes on the heels of two others — one by the University of East Anglia itself and the other by Penn State University, both completed in the spring, concerning its own employee, Prof. Michael Mann. Mr. Mann was one of the Climategate principals who proposed a plan, which was clearly laid out in emails whose veracity Mr. Mann has not challenged, to destroy a scientific journal that dared to publish three papers with which he and his East Anglia friends disagreed. These two reviews also saw no evil. For example, Penn State “determined that Dr. Michael E. Mann did not engage in, nor did he participate in, directly or indirectly, any actions that seriously deviated from accepted practices within the academic community.”



Readers of both earlier reports need to know that both institutions receive tens of millions in federal global warming research funding (which can be confirmed by perusing the grant histories of Messrs. Jones or Mann, compiled from public sources, that are available online at freere​pub​lic​.com). Any admission of substantial scientific misbehavior would likely result in a significant loss of funding.



It’s impossible to find anything wrong if you really aren’t looking. In a famous email of May 29, 2008, Phil Jones, director of East Anglia’s CRU, wrote to Mr. Mann, under the subject line “IPCC & FOI,” “Can you delete any emails you may have had with Keith [Briffa] re AR4 [the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report]? Keith will do likewise … can you also email Gene [Wahl, an employee of the U.S. Department of Commerce] to do the same … We will be getting Caspar [Amman, of the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research] to do likewise.”



Mr. Jones emailed later that he had “deleted loads of emails” so that anyone who might bring a Freedom of Information Act request would get very little. According to _New Scientist_ writer Fred Pearce, “Russell and his team never asked Jones or his colleagues whether they had actually done this.”



The Russell report states that “On the allegation of withholding temperature data, we find that the CRU was not in a position to withhold access to such data.” Really? Here’s what CRU director Jones wrote to Australian scientist Warrick Hughes in February 2005: “We have 25 years or so invested in the work. Why should I make the data available to you, when your aim is to try and find something wrong with it[?]”



Then there’s the problem of interference with peer review in the scientific literature. Here too Mr. Russell could find no wrong: “On the allegations that there was subversion of the peer review or editorial process, we find no evidence to substantiate this.”



Really? Mr. Mann claims that temperatures roughly 800 years ago, in what has been referred to as the Medieval Warm Period, were not as warm as those measured recently. This is important because if modern temperatures are not unusual, it casts doubt on the fear that global warming is a serious threat. In 2003, Willie Soon of the Smithsonian Institution and Sallie Baliunas of Harvard published a paper in the journal _Climate Research_ that took exception to Mr. Mann’s work, work which also was at variance with a large number of independent studies of paleoclimate. So it would seem the Soon‐​Baliunas paper was just part of the normal to‐​and‐​fro of science.



But Mr. Jones wrote Mr. Mann on March 11, 2003, that “I’ll be emailing the journal to tell them I’m having nothing more to do with it until they rid themselves of this troublesome editor,” Chris de Freitas of the University of Auckland. Mr. Mann responded to Mr. Jones on the same day: “I think we should stop considering _Climate Research_ as a legitimate peer‐​reviewed journal. Perhaps we should encourage our colleagues … to no longer submit to, or cite papers in, this journal. We would also need to consider what we tell or request our more reasonable colleagues who currently sit on the editorial board.”



Mr. Mann ultimately wrote to Mr. Jones on July 11, 2003, that “I think the community should … terminate its involvement with this journal at all levels … and leave it to wither away into oblivion and disrepute.”



 _Climate Research_ and several other journals have stopped accepting anything that substantially challenges the received wisdom on global warming perpetuated by the CRU. I have had four perfectly good manuscripts rejected out of hand since the CRU shenanigans, and I’m hardly the only one. Roy Spencer of the University of Alabama, Huntsville, has noted that it’s becoming nearly impossible to publish anything on global warming that’s nonalarmist in peer‐​reviewed journals.



Of course, Mr. Russell didn’t look to see if the ugly pressure tactics discussed in the Climategate emails had any consequences. That’s because they only interviewed CRU people, not the people whom they had trashed.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA couple of days ago I reported here how Joe Bastardi warned that Europe would soon be turning cold and wintry. Well, he hasn’t backed off at all from that forecast and appears to be gaining more confidence with it.
Although the timing may have shifted about a bit , the overall pattern remains: cold Arctic cold and winter precipitation are about to seize the European continent.
At the 2-minute mark Joe mentions the 11-16 day forecast for Europe, where the GFS model shows “brutal cold” across Europe.
Then at the 3:35 mark he focusses in on the European continent, showing a chart of projected snowfall (in inches!):

Chart forecasts massive snow blanketing Europe later next month. Chart cropped from 12/30/2016 Weatherbell Daily Update.
Bastardi warns:
This is going to be a huge deal. You’re going to see the weather in Europe making global headlines as it gets covered with tremendous amounts of snow. And when you look at this […] Europe is brutally cold […] and Europe, get ready because there’s going to be all sorts of you know what is going to break loose over there.”
The forecast is still a couple of weeks out, but it is solidifying and the watch by now ought to be taken seriously. For me it is time to go out and buy that back-up generator – and don’t count on wind and solar energy to be there in a time of need! Most solar panels will likely be buried until spring.

In fact global headlines have already been made, with reports of massive snowfall in Turkey, Japan and North America, along with extraordinary cold and snow across all of Siberia and Russia.
Joe’s childish critics
It’s only natural that some obstinate fans of global warming are not thrilled about hearing such news, and they lash out childishly — steadfastly remaining convinced that snow is a thing of the past and is not supposed to happen anymore.
And if harsh wintry weather does strike in a way it did in the old days, without hesitation they insist it’s a freak anomaly, or indulge in an orgy of creative rationalization and blame it somehow on global warming.
These readers always attack and discredit messenger Joe.
Concerning Joe’s meteorological credentials, let’s keep in mind that he is not just some run-of-the-mill weatherman who parrots whatever bulletins the weather services put out. He is in fact a decades-long meteorological veteran who actually looks at the monthly forecasts issued by the weather services and questions them using a huge database of historical weather data and meteorological science.
Moreover meteorology for the Bastardi family has become a generational thing. His father was a successful weatherman, and now Joe’s son is following the family tradition as well. If there ever was such a thing as meteorological genes, the Bastardis certainly seem to have them. These guys have precipitation running through their veins!
And of course mistakes are made, that’s all part of the weather forecasting business — especially when forecasting more than 7 days out.

"LONDON  —   Bernie Ecclestone’s longstanding leadership of Formula One ended when Liberty Media officially completed its takeover of the series on Monday and named Chase Carey, the vice chairman of 21st Century Fox, as Formula One’s new chief executive. The takeover came five days after the International Automobile Federation, the sport’s governing body, approved the sale of Formula One to Liberty Media, an American company that invests in entertainment and sports. Liberty said in a statement on Monday that the transaction price represented an enterprise value for Formula One of $8 billion and an equity value of $4. 4 billion. The    Ecclestone, who has been in charge of the series for nearly 40 years, will remain as an honorary chairman and will be an adviser to the circuit, according to Liberty. “I’m very pleased that the business has been acquired by Liberty,” Ecclestone said. “I am sure that Chase will execute his role in a way that will benefit the sport. ” Last September, Liberty Media Corp. which is controlled by the    tycoon John Malone, ended years of uncertainty about the ownership of Formula One when it announced plans for a takeover. Last week, the World Motor Sport Council of the F. I. A. as the governing body is known, approved the change of control of Delta Topco, the series’s holding company, from the private equity firm CVC Capital Partners to Liberty Media Group. With Liberty’s shareholders having approved the move, an F. I. A. green light was the last regulatory step before the sale. Although Carey had been expected to replace Ecclestone, the buyout came sooner than expected and some time ahead of the new Formula One season, which starts on March 26 with the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne."

About two weeks ago, NOAA released the annual version of their latest Arctic Report Card.  Of course, the usual media outlets peddled the requisite doomsday headlines when describing the report’s contents, deploying words like grim  and dire  and pedantically issuing a failing grade so as to paint a picture of an Arctic climate teetering on the brink of catastrophe.
It was on page 33 that the authors divulged the Greenland Ice Sheet’s mass balance statistics for 2015-’16.
2016 Arctic Report Card     “Between April 2015 and April 2016 (the most recent period of available data) there was a net ice melt loss of 191 Gt.  This is about the same as the April 2014-April 2015 mass loss (190 Gt).”
So the ice sheet reportedly lost 191 gigatonnes (Gt) of water between April 2015 and April 2016.  Interestingly, last year’s report card (2015) had the April 2014 to April 2015 loss pegged at -186 Gt, not -190 Gt.  Somehow another 4 Gt were added to the total loss for 2014-’15 between then and now.
2015 Arctic Report Card     “Ice mass loss of 186 Gt over the entire ice sheet between April 2014 and April 2015 was 22% below the average mass loss of 238 Gt for the 2002- 2015 period.”
For 2013-’14, the mass loss for the Greenland Ice Sheet was even lower: just -6 Gt.  In other words, the ice sheet was essentially in balance.
2014 Arctic Report Card     “A negligible ice mass loss of 6 Gt between June 2013 and June 2014″
To review, that’s -6 Gt, -186 Gt, and -191 Gt for the 2013 to 2016 mass balance records.  Averaged together, the loss was –128 Gt per year for 2013-’16, which is a substantially slower rate of loss relative to previous years.
A Rapid Deceleration In Greenland Ice Sheet Mass Loss Since 2012
Now here’s where it gets interesting.  For their 2013 report card, NOAA authors wanted to accentuate just how profound the loss of ice mass had been for the 2008-2012 period compared with the 2002-2006 period.  This way, they could point to a rapid acceleration of ice sheet mass loss.
2013 Arctic Report Card    “The rate of mass loss has accelerated during the period of observation, the mass loss of 367 Gt/y between September 2008 and September 2012 being almost twice that for the period June 2002-July 2006 (193 Gt/y)“

As some may have noticed, NOAA curiously uses different starting and ending months for each demarcated period, making direct data comparisons difficult (due to different gain/melt rates depending on the month).  Instead of comparing September to September every year (as they did in 2008-’12), they’ve compared April to April in some years, June to June in another year, and June to July in still another 4-year-long selection.  And they’ve ignored the melt record for 2007 altogether in the above analysis when comparing 2002-2006 to 2008-2012.   NOAA wouldn’t dare “move the goal posts” by cherry-picking different start and end points depending on the melt rates for specific months so as to bolster their claims of “acceleration” would they?   That would imply operating with a tendentious agenda rather than objectively reporting the data.   Would they do that?
But instead of digressing to discuss their odd “selectivity” with regard to choosing some months or years to start and end with instead of others, we will just accept NOAA’s methodology and analyze the yearly averages as originally reported.
So according to present and historical NOAA Arctic Report Cards we have  the following rates of annual Greenland Ice Sheet mass loss for 2002-2016:
                                        –193 Gt/yr for 2002-2006
                                        -367 Gt/yr for 2008-2012
                                        -128 Gt/yr for 2013-2016
We can even go a step further and add the 1990s to the record.  Despite of a highly increasing rate of human CO2 emissions for the 1992-2002 period, NASA’s Zwally et al. (2005) reported an average net gain of +11 Gt/yr for the Greenland Ice Sheet during those 10 years.
Zwally et al., 2005     “Changes in ice mass are estimated from elevation changes derived from 10.5 years (Greenland) [1992-2002] … of satellite radar altimetry data from the European Remote-sensingSatellites ERS-1 and -2. The Greenland ice sheet is thinning at the margins (–42 ± 2 Gt/yr–1 below the equilibrium-line altitude (ELA)) and growing inland (+53 ± 2 Gt/yr–1 above the ELA) with a small overall mass gain (+11  ± 3 Gt/yr–1; –0.03 mm a–1SLE (sea-levelequivalent)).”

So, adding the 1992-2002 NASA values to the 2002-2016 NOAA values, here is what the overall trend in Greenland Ice Sheet Mass Balance looks like during 1992-2016 using these as-reported mass balance values:

Notice the dramatic rate of deceleration (by two-thirds) in Greenland Ice Sheet mass loss averages for recent years on the graph above, contradicting the reports of a perpetually increasing ice loss acceleration.
And the slowing mass loss rate has continued in 2016-’17.  According to DMI monitoring, the Greenland Ice Sheet is gaining ice substantially above the long-term average in the last 3-4 months.  It is highly likely that by the end of the record, the 2016-’17 mass loss will be significantly less than 200 Gt/yr, and perhaps less than 100 Gt/yr again.

 
The Context Of The Insignificant 1992-2016 Greenland Ice Sheet Mass Change
Some may counter the above analysis by claiming that even losing 100 to 200 Gt of ice per year is still quite substantial and concerning, and thus the alarmist headlines are merited.   But this perspective ignores history.
First, estimates of surface mass balance for the Greenland Ice Sheet almost invariably use the 1961-1990 period as a baseline, as it is assumed that the ice sheet was essentially in balance (no net losses or gains) for those 30 years.  As records have shown, though, the 1961-1990 baseline period was the coldest decadal-scale stretch since the 1800s for Greenland, which means that the 1995-to-present Arctic warming trend is being directly compared to a very cold period for the Greenland ice sheet rather than a more representative period.  In fact, as indicated by several recent papers, the Greenland ice sheet’s surface mass balance was similar to or even lower during the as-warm-as-now 1920s to 1940s than it has been during the last few decades.  If the baseline period were to include Greenland’s early 20th century warm years (1920s to 1940s), the recent losses would likely be substantially smaller.
Also, let’s consider what losing, say, 150 Gt per year actually means in terms of its environmental impact.   According to Shepherd et al. (2012), the Greenland Ice Sheet lost an average of -142 Gt/yr (with substantial uncertainty of ±49 Gt/yr) during the years 1992-2011.  This translates into an average of 0.4 mm/yr of sea level rise contribution from the Greenland Ice Sheet during this high-melt period.  In other words, over the entire 20-year record (1992-2011), the Greenland Ice Sheet contributed to sea level rise at a rate of 4 centimeters (1½ inches) per century.  That’s it.  That’s what a loss of -142 Gt per year multiplied by 20 years translates into.
Even if this alleged modern rate of loss were doubled to -300 Gt/yr, we are still only talking about 3 or 4 inches of sea level rise contribution from the Greenland Ice Sheet every century if that rate of loss could be sustained for 100 years.   As indicated above, that rate of loss couldn’t even be sustained for more than a few years in the last few decades.
Finally, as mentioned above, scientists presume the Greenland Ice Sheet was in balance during the 1961-1990 period, which is why it is used as the baseline reference period for surface mass balance estimates.  If that’s the case, there is no reason why estimates of the human impact on the Greenland Ice Sheet’s mass balance should not extend back to 1961 too.  Or even 1951.  After all, the IPCC has indicated in their latest (2014) synthesis report that the overwhelming (“more than half”) anthropogenic influence on climate commenced that particular year:
 “It is extremely likely more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010 was caused by the anthropogenic increase in greenhouse gas concentrations and other anthropogenic forcings together.”
So if we were to include the ~40 years of majority anthropogenic influence between 1951 and 1991 that apparently saw no net change in Greenland Ice Sheet mass balance with a (rounded up) combined mass loss rate of -150 Gt/yr between 1992 and 2016, the total human impact on the mass balance of the Greenland Ice Sheet might amount to an annual loss average of -55 to -60 Gt for the entire 65-year period.  That’s a rate of contribution to sea level rise of about 1 ½ centimeters per century since 1951, or since humans allegedly began causing the majority of global warming.
Since a headline that reads “Humans Have Caused Greenland’s Ice To Melt At Rate That Adds 1 ½ Centimeters Per Century To Sea Levels!” probably wouldn’t be effective in grabbing readers’ attention, it’s understandable why journalists and advocates for the cause would prefer to use doomsday language instead.  It’s also understandable why they’d prefer to gloss over the recent deceleration in Greenland Ice Sheet mass loss found in the latest Arctic Report Card.  It sounds so much scarier to write about the hundreds of billions of tons of ice lost instead.

One need only look at the **Extinction Rebellion** phenomenon to see how bizarrely and hysterically disconnected from reality and reason the elite really are. Extinction Rebellion, and its Climate Jugend led by the odious **Greta Thunberg** , is an elite obsession par excellence: wealthy, privileged, private-school toffs shouting and shaking their clammy fists at working class people trying to make their daily commute in order to pay their rising electricity bills (courtesy of the same climate-obsessed elites).



Extinction Rebellion is also classically elitist in that its proponents are absolutely convinced that they’re not just better off than the _hoi polloi_ , but actually better. After all, they’re better educated, richer and oh-so-much-more-cosmopolitan than the herds of knuckle-dragging plebs.



Except… the real sheeple are the panic-stricken lemmings of the elite.



Last week, the world stock markets suffered their worst week since the financial crisis in 2008, with $6 trillion wiped from shares and, in some markets, a sell-off at a rate not seen since the Great Depression almost a century ago. Why? Because global investors are in a panic about the potential economic fallout from the coronavirus epidemic.



Many commentators are making the point that this is mad. **Ross Clark** argues convincingly in the Spectator that the ‘most dangerous thing about coronavirus is the hysteria’. Philip Aldrick, economics editor of The Times, agrees. He says it is the ‘panic we should fear more than the virus itself’.



In their excellent books, _Risk: The Science and Politics of Fear_ and _Panicology_ , **Dan Gardner** and **Simon Briscoe/Hugh Aldersly-Williams** respectively show that much of modern political and social movement is driven by fear and unreason. **Michael Crichton** argued explicitly, in _State of Fear_ , that the global warming panic is deliberately driven to keep people fearfully obedient.



But rather than ‘stupid’ ordinary people running around like headless chooks, it’s the supposedly ‘superior’, ‘educated’ elite who are doing the most panic-stricken damage.



This madness is not being driven by the ‘low-information’, knuckle-dragging, gullible ignorant masses, but by the information-rich, university-educated and refined global business and government elites.



The contrast between the responses to coronavirus from the elites and ordinary people has been stark. Even as the level of panic in the mainstream reporting around coronavirus has risen, ordinary people have just gotten on with their lives. The supposedly well-informed elites, who often accuse the ‘dumb’ masses of being vulnerable to hysteria and ‘fake news’, have themselves been prodded into panic. Meanwhile, where they are not in lockdowns, ordinary people are still going to work, commuting, going to bars… They’re simply getting on with their lives, while taking note of the potential risks.



The elites are in free-falling panic; like a herd of wildebeest, panicked by the sight of a predator and rushing blindly across crocodile-infested waters, they have sparked a potential global economic meltdown. Meanwhile, we see stoic common sense, simple but profound wisdom, on the part of the ‘great unwashed’.



Just as much as climate change, coronavirus is a genuine problem; but it’s a manageable one and far, far from the biggest threat human beings face. Coronavirus is almost certainly not going to lead to mass deaths, especially in the West, let alone anything resembling a mediaeval plague. In the meantime, work on treatments and vaccines is well advanced.



As has happened repeatedly in recent years, such as in the case of the Fukushima nuclear accident, the panic is far, far deadlier than the supposed “threat”.



It’s the panic of the elites which is doing the damage, not the “complacency” of the masses. You can lead a fool by the nose through a Marketing or Social Science degree, but you can’t make them think.



To paraphrase Orwell, one has to belong to the intelligentsia to panic over something like this. No common person could be such a fool.

"Dutch airline KLM recently launched a new advertising campaign called “Fly Responsibly”. Remarkably, it seems to encourage viewers to fly less. “Do you always have to meet face-to-face?”, the advert asks. “Could you take the train instead?”. The influence of climate campaigner Greta Thunberg likely explains why airlines feel obliged to say these things. Flight shame – or “flygskam” – has gripped many regular flyers with a sense of unease about the aviation industry, which consumes five million barrels of oil a day and is predicted to account for around 22% of global carbon emissions by 2050.

      Travel the world without destroying it – Imagine newsletter #5


 European high-speed rail networks already offer an alternative to air traffic between European countries for distances shorter than 1,000 kilometres. For longer journeys, sleeper trains are becoming increasingly popular. These services run through the night and offer passengers a berth to sleep in. As more and more consumers question the ethics of their next flight, rail companies see an opportunity – and competition with airlines is heating up.  But can night trains help offset the international journeys that most people currently make by aeroplane? From 2009 until 2018, the European night train network shrank steadily. The same is true for conventional intercity train networks, especially in southern and western Europe. This made air travel the only alternative on many routes. But that appears to be changing. When German Rail decided to withdraw its network of overnight passenger trains in 2015, Austrian Federal Railways (ÖBB) decided to take over some of its services. In 2017, ÖBB’s Nightjet services carried around 1.4 million passengers, more than doubling its total passengers from the previous year.  In 2018, ÖBB achieved another 10% increase in passenger numbers. ÖBB CEO, Andreas Matthä, said that “overnight services are a viable alternative to short-haul flights” and committed to continue investing in new services. As a result, ÖBB is expanding its routes on the NightJet network of sleeper trains. From January 2020, night trains will once again run between Vienna and Brussels, 16 years after the service closed. In the UK, Great Western Railway plans to renovate the sleeper trains it runs to Cornwall. The Caledonian Sleeper, which runs between London, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen has been revamped with a £150 million investment in new trains.  In response to a public petition, the Swedish government plans to reintroduce night train services to other European countries. A sleeper train service from Malmö in southern Sweden to London has been planned for 2022 at the earliest. The service could set off in the evening and arrive in the English capital at lunchtime the next day. At almost 1,300 kilometres, the trip is typical of the many rail journeys that could offset those currently taken between European countries by aeroplane.

      Transport emissions have doubled in 40 years – expand railways to get them on track


 Aviation industry CEOs are worried that flight shame could threaten passenger traffic and in some countries this already seems to be happening. Swedavia, an airline which operates ten of Sweden’s busiest airports, reported a 4% fall in passengers in 2019 compared with the previous year. The decrease was primarily in domestic travel, while the number of international passengers fell to a lesser extent. Despite this, European air traffic still grew by 4.2% in 2019.  It’s too soon to say whether the night train revival is a permanent trend prompted by flygskam. Nevertheless, environmental awareness still motivates the choices of travellers.  Researchers who study consumer profiles in different markets recently identified a new one: the “environmental traveller”. People who fall into this market segment try to maintain a lifestyle that is as environmentally friendly as possible – and that includes reducing the number of flights they take.  But the researchers found that awareness of the environmental crisis doesn’t automatically translate into behaviour changes, such as choosing other transport modes over air travel. Most often, distance or cost are more powerful motivations, particularly for short and medium-haul routes. A recent study from the Netherlands found that passengers who travel for leisure purposes seem to be most attracted to the option of night trains. It’s possible that night train services could simply generate new demand from these customers instead of substituting existing airline passengers. The researchers found that 40% of business travellers still opted to fly the day before and stay in a hotel instead, though many thought the relative comfort of sleeper trains was appealing.  Research conducted on behalf of the European parliament is much more pessimistic, concluding that there are more challenges than opportunities for night trains to grow in Europe. Chief among them is the continued growth of low-cost airlines. Infrastructure costs currently prohibit long-distance night trains which might be able to tempt more passengers out of these aeroplanes. Subsidy and investment to expand rail networks may be necessary for the sector to compete with aviation. Making airlines pay fuel duty could also help. In the meantime, flygskam could still be effective if it means people keep the pressure on the aviation industry to reform and reduce its growing carbon footprint.

Guest essay by Eric Worrall
Michael Metcalfe, a senior merchant banker who gave a TED Talk in 2014 campaigning for money to be printed on a vast scale, to fund global charities, now wants governments to print 100s of billions of dollars, to combat Climate Change.
Can we print money for climate finance? Three years ago, the idea of using money in this way was something of a taboo. Once you break down and dismantle the idea that money is a finite resource, governments can quickly get overwhelmed by demands from their people to print more and more money for other causes: education, health care, welfare — even defense.
And there are some truly terrible historical examples of money printing — uncontrolled money printing — leading to hyperinflation. Think: Weimar Republic in 1930; Zimbabwe more recently, in 2008, when the prices of basic goods like bread are doubling every day. But all of this is moving the public debate forward, so much so, that money printing for the people is now discussed openly in the financial media, and even in some political manifestos.
But it’s important the debate doesn’t stop here, with printing national currencies. Because climate change is a shared global problem, there are some really compelling reasons why we should be printing that international currency that’s issued by the IMF, to fund it. The Special Drawing Right, or SDR, is the IMF’s electronic unit of account that governments use to transfer funds amongst each other. Think of it as a peer-to-peer payment network, like Bitcoin, but for governments.
And it’s truly global. Each of the 188 members of the IMF hold SDR quotas as part of their foreign exchange reserves. These are national stores of wealth that countries keep to protect themselves against currency crises. And that global nature is why, at the height of the financial crisis in 2009, the IMF issued those extra 250 billion dollars — because it served as a collective global action that safeguarded countries large and small in one fell swoop.
But here — here’s the intriguing part. More than half of those extra SDRs that were printed in 2009 — 150 billion dollars’ worth — went to developed market countries who, for the most part, have a modest need for these foreign exchange reserves, because they have flexible exchange rates. So those extra reserves that were printed in 2009, in the end, for developed market countries at least, weren’t really needed. And they remain unused today.
So here’s an idea. As a first step, why don’t we start spending those unused, those extra SDRs that were printed in 2009, to combat climate change?

The Climate TED Talk was filmed in 2015, though the recording appears to have just been posted on the internet today.
From my perspective, there seems to be a remarkable similarity between Metcalfe’s 2014 plan to print vast sums of new money and give it to the UN, to combat global poverty, and Metcalfe’s November 2015 plan to print vast sums of new money and give it to the UN, to combat climate change.
Both of Metcalfe’s schemes seem to involve imposing what is effectively a gigantic new UN tax on the world’s workers.
Printing money is the ultimate stealth tax – instead of openly taking money out of people’s pockets, printing new money drains value from cash already in circulation. People still have the same amount of money as they did before you printed the new money, but some of the buying power of that money has been transferred into the newly minted cash.
But what about the alleged “benefits” of inflating the economy with newly printed money?
I spent a lot of time with bankers during the crisis, developing banking software. The rest of the economy had already collapsed, and I had bills to pay.
In my opinion, the only people the bailouts “saved” were bankers, and friendly senior politicians and donors who were heavily invested in banking stocks.
The bankers I talked to knew Subprime Mortgages were trash, well before the financial crisis, but there are fancy strategies by which sharp financial traders can make money out of the most unlikely rubbish.
However these fancy strategies require certain preconditions to function. One of these implicit preconditions is that the market remains “liquid”. The magic only works, when traders can keep their inherently unstable Portfolios balanced, by continuously buying and selling small parcels of financial instruments.
When Subprime mortgages collapsed, triggering the 2007 banking crisis, the market totally froze. Nobody was interested in buying subprime mortgage products at any price. Almost everyone was stuck with unbalanced portfolio positions which they were no longer able to adjust, positions which rapidly toppled into bank breaking losses.
Then suddenly it was all better – the friendly politicians showed up, with a huge deluge of freshly printed money, to make it all better. Not only did this public cash save the jobs and savings of the people whose recklessness had created the crisis, the public money actually enriched many of the failed bankers, in some cases beyond their wildest dreams.
Precious little of the bailout money helped ordinary taxpayers, who ultimately funded the bailout, via the money printing stealth tax.
If politicians listen to Metcalfe’s plan, and fire up the printing presses to “save the climate”, fund global charities, or for this year’s noble sounding cause, whatever that is, all that will happen in my opinion is that bankers will grow even fatter. The increased funding will help the UN to become more powerful. And of course, ordinary people, who would ultimately pay for this new banker party through the depleted spending power of their debased life savings, will be further impoverished.

 **David Theobald**



Pragmatism vs ideology. We are certainly ‘ruled’ here in New Zealand by the latter. Our Government is ideologically driven in virtually all it does. I have long thought that those at the levers of power start behind the eight ball on account of their lack of intellectual horsepower. They fill this void with a slavish adherence to an ideology; an ideology I find abhorrent.



Only this week that natural successor to Bertrand Russell, **Julie Anne Genter** , came up with new madness concerning cyclists and those infernal scooters. Scooters will still be allowed on pavements but they will be limited to 15kph, so that’s alright (try running at 15kph). How is this going to be policed? Nevertheless, it is the least daft of her ideas currently up for feedback. 



Prize for the most stupid goes to the ‘right’ of cyclists to undertake slower or stationary cars on the left at junctions – even those vehicles in a ‘turn left only’ lane. The velocipedes are then permitted to go straight ahead; how to engineer multiple accidents from an Associate Minister of Transport who doesn’t even possess a driving licence.



But, I digress. We have been labouring (pun intended) under the worst ‘ideology over pragmatism’ decision for a couple of years following the infamous ‘Captain’s Call’ to shut down the oil and gas industry. This is closely followed by the barmy ‘Net Carbon Zero by 2050’. The only input to this appears to have been when Jacinda Ardern interrupted a visit from a foreign dignitary to accept a petition from several hundred Green activists. 



I’m sorry, this woman just does not have the intelligence or real world experience to hold down the job she currently holds. Oh, that she had access to, and more importantly the willingness and ability to comprehend, the below sort of analysis which refers to the only other country (to my knowledge) to have committed to this Net Carbon Zero by 2050 craziness. The UK’s trajectory to this insanity was Theresa May’s parting gift to the nation and, worryingly, Boris has not only subscribed to it, he has doubled down on it somewhat bringing the dates of compliance on parts of it closer.



The article below was written by **Matt Ridley**. He sits in the House of Lords (probably irrelevant) and knows what he is talking about. The article outlines the practical effects of an energy policy aimed at a ludicrous ideological and realistically unreachable goal. Fancy a read, Prime Minister?



The Government’s energy policy could cripple global Britain



[…] Britain has uniquely legislated to reach net-zero carbon dioxide emissions in 2050, which means going cold turkey on the 85% of our energy that currently comes from gas, oil and coal. That means finding ways to run not just the electricity grid, which is about 20% of our energy, without net emissions, but all our heating, transport and industrial processes too. […] reputable estimates put the cost at around **£3 trillion** in the absence of any breakthrough in nuclear fusion or carbon capture.



The cost of some existing policies is already being passed on to consumers at the rate of £10 billion a year. Subsidies for wind, solar and biomass electricity have made household electricity prices about 35% higher than they would otherwise have been, according to the government’s own estimates. The prices paid by businesses – which are also passed on to consumers in the prices of products and services – are more like 60% higher. Industrial electricity prices here are among the highest in the world. That is a big drag on competitiveness […]



The main beneficiaries from these policies are the renewable energy industry, and the government itself, which charges VAT on top of these subsidies.[…]



The world, and Asia in particular, is electrifying more and more processes, because it is such a versatile and efficient source of power, but we and the EU seem to be moving in the other direction. One of the reasons for the fall in electricity consumption is the emigration of industry to cheaper locations. […] No wonder factories are moving. We have already lost our aluminium industry and much of our steel industry. We still need these materials but we import them from countries with higher emissions, which makes no sense.[…]



Energy is not just another raw material, like paper or cement. It’s the very source of wealth.[…] High energy costs are extremely dangerous for an economy over time. They become embedded in the costs of the capital they create and they deter experimental innovation. […]



In the past few weeks, the government has made a string of announcements relating to energy, all attempting to appease the green lobby. Every single one will raise costs to consumers but reward special-interest lobbies of crony capitalists […]



[…] In the case of transport, fuel tax is already exceedingly high in this country, leading many hauliers who come here from the continent to carry extra diesel tanks so they don’t have to refuel while here. Insisting on biofuels will increase the underlying cost and that will be multiplied by Fuel Duty (is that the Chancellor’s cunning plan?). In any case, it takes almost as much diesel and gas to plant, fertilise and harvest a crop of wheat as you get ethanol out of it.



Britain deludes itself that it is setting an example to the world by decarbonising faster. But China, India and even Germany are still building hundreds of coal-fired power stations. The UK is unlikely to be able to manufacture attractive high-value exports if its energy costs are higher than the competition.



[…] The experience of Scotland clearly shows that even when government colludes with the renewables industry, there is almost no local employment in the manufacture of wind turbine parts, because renewables are already expensive, and insisting on substantial local content drives up costs still further. Wind turbines will not be made in the United Kingdom, unless labour costs are driven down, and the only way to do that is to force down living standards. Does that sound like good politics to you? Me neither.



The purpose of decarbonisation is to alter the climate for the better. Yet nobody in their right mind thinks that net zero emissions will prevent wet winters and flooding. […]



Our energy policy is centrally planned but it resembles the practice under fascist regimes rather than socialist ones, because it rewards favoured private firms. […]



I fear that The Conservatives have fallen into the error of thinking of the nation as a business. This is both illiberal and makes the classic mistake of answering to the interests of producers rather than consumers. Businesses are command economies on the inside (which is why business people generally speaking do not make good politicians). But populations and the nation states they create to represent their common interests are not businesses: they are voluntary collaborations. The green agenda, as with any ‘crisis’, gives a pretext for the creation of a command economy. If we continue down this road it will not only make us uncompetitive, but also, like all the other corrupt and inefficient command economies before us, very, very dirty.

"**Images from inside Hong Kong's Polytechnic University show the aftermath of a week-long standoff between protesters and police.**
On Tuesday, university officials spent hours searching for anyone left. The fight for control of the Polytechnic University has been one of the defining moments of nearly six months of anti-government protests in the territory.
Protesters barricaded themselves inside the campus almost two weeks ago. The authorities responded by sealing off the campus, trapping more than 1,000 inside. Over the past week, most protesters have either surrendered or escaped.
A team including university management, security guards, councillors and the Hong Kong Red Cross walk through a canteen in search of any remaining protesters who may be hiding.
Food was left cooking on a hob in the canteen kitchen.
Activists - some armed with bows and arrows - engaged in intense battles with the police during the siege. Other items found during the search included, below, a Molotov cocktail and a hammer left on the roof of a university building.
A disparate collection of items were found discarded inside buildings on the campus. Here, clothes could be seen strewn all over a bathroom floor.
Other items left behind by protesters included face masks...
...helmets and food left in one room...
...and other belongings left in a dorm.
Officials found only one woman lying exhausted on a couch, who refused to leave. Others might be in hiding, but it is thought unlikely that anyone else remains.

"The New South Wales’ Liberal premier, Gladys Berejiklian, says it will not take much to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, and it would be “the stuff of dreams” for an Australian Coalition government to legislate that target. The comments came at a Wednesday night webinar conversation between Berejiklian and the former British prime minister Theresa May, hosted by the group Coalition for Conservation.  Drawing an implicit contrast between her administration and the Morrison government, Berejiklian said it was “music to her ears” to hear May describe Britain as “a modern progressive democracy with a centre-right government” that had world-leading emissions policy that promoted economic growth. “I’m sure if I said this publicly … I don’t think there’s any media on this webinar … the assessment we’ve done is the targets for net zero by 2050, it doesn’t take much to get there,” she said, citing how quickly the world was being changed by clean technology and digitisation. Berejiklian praised May on her performance as prime minister, describing it as “legacy-making”. “To have a conservative Tory government legislate 2050 emissions is the stuff of dreams in Australia, and we can only hope to emulate it,” she said. Britain has been urging other countries to follow it in adopting the mid-century net zero emissions goal before it hosts the next major UN climate conference in Glasgow, citing scientific evidence, but the Morrison government is resisting the push. The conference summit has ben delayed until November 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic. All Australian states and a growing number of businesses, including some major energy and fossil fuel companies, have backed a 2050 net zero emissions target. Groups representing the breadth of Australian business and society last week warned the country was “woefully unprepared” for the impact of climate change and its governments needed to do far more to address it. Berejiklian said she believed a post-Covid world would present opportunities to consider “more sustainable ways of living, more sustainable ways of working”. “I think as we emerge from Covid that the public will feel connected and more in tune with protecting the environment,” she said. The premier praised her energy and environment minister, Matt Kean, for working with regional communities to set up proposed renewable energy zones, and raised the challenge and possibilities of helping fossil fuel-reliant communities adapt to a low-emissions future. “I think what we need to do better, perhaps, in NSW and Australia to improve the narrative is to target those in communities who might be transitioning out of other jobs,” she said. “You can hypothecate those [clean energy] jobs into those communities because their main concern is not what they are digging out of the ground, but the fact they are putting food on the table. If you can allay those concerns and overlap the jobs growth in the communities that are feeling the angst, I think that is a mutually beneficial way forward.” May said the British Conservatives had accepted a 2050 net zero emission target without little pushback due to support for climate action having built in the party over time, beginning with Margaret Thatcher being one of the first leaders to talk about the issue. She dismissed suggestions governments had to choose between economic growth or climate change. The British economy had grown while emissions fell 43% before the pandemic-induced economic plunge this year, she said. “I always say here in the UK that the Conservative Party is the party that has got ‘conserve’ it in its name and therefore we should be naturally thinking about our environment,” May said. “As centre-right politicians, as conservatives, we also believe in leaving something for the next generation, and climate change is about ensuring that the planet is there for the next generation and generations to come.” May said she Conservative governments should have done more to encourage investment in, and increase the role played by, nuclear power. “I think that’s an important part of the mix,” she said. Berejiklian responded that while nuclear power was illegal in Australia, there had been a debate “from some crossbenchers” in NSW on whether uranium mining should be allowed in the state. She did not volunteer that the One Nation push won support from the deputy premier, John Barilaro. “That’s unlikely to be passed in the short-term, but it’s interesting we’ve been having that debate in NSW,” she said. The premier said the market indication in Australia was that nuclear power would be costly and unlikely to attract investors if legalised. About 16% of electricity in NSW came from renewable sources over the past year, compared with a 25% share across the five eastern states. In addition to three new renewable energy zones, the state government has pledged to increase the amount of gas available in the state under a $2bn energy agreement with the federal government and said coal mining would generate jobs and royalties for decades to come."

Normally, I would not carry a science story like this, but it is just so weird, it seemed worth noting. Those with arachnophobia need not read this.
Darwin’s Bark Spider
Matjaz Gregoric, a research associate at the Scientific Research Centre of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts (ZRC SAZU), Jovan Hadzi Institute of Biology, and coauthors studied the mating behavior of the Madagascan Darwin’s bark spider (Caerostris darwini), a sexually size dimorphic species from Madagascar with females several times larger and heavier than males. They uncovered a rich sexual repertoire in C. darwini that predictably involved sexual cannibalism and genital mutilation. In addition, their surprising finding was that males of this species routinely salivate onto female genitalia.
“Oral sexual contact seems to be an obligate sexual behavior in this species as all males did it before, in between, and after copulations, even up to 100 times.” said Gregoric who led the field and laboratory work that resulted in the current publication. Matjaz Kuntner, the senior author on this paper and chair of the Jovan Hadzi Institute of Biology ZRC SAZU only recently discovered and described C. darwini, noting that it produces nature’s largest webs and toughest silk. Now, this intriguing finding adds sexual behaviors to the species’ natural history.
Oral sexual contact is rare in the animal kingdom, except in mammals, where fellatio-like behaviors are known in macaques, lemurs, bonobos, hyenas, cheetahs, lions, dolphins and bats. However, cunnilingus-like behaviors, like the one shown in this spider are even rarer. Gregorič and coauthors suggest that oral sexual encounters could be a mechanism for boosting the male’s chances of paternity by either signaling the male’s quality or creating a chemical environment that would favor one male’s sperm against the sperm of rival males.

"Mary Tyler Moore, who died on Wednesday at 80, had a   career in show business. But she is most remembered for two indelible sitcom roles: Laura Petrie on “The Dick Van Dyke Show” and later, Mary Richards on “The Mary Tyler Moore Show. ” [ Read Mary Tyler Moore’s obituary | 5 great episodes to stream ] Ms. Moore first appeared in The New York Times in 1962, during the first season of “The Dick Van Dyke Show,” which ran from 1961 to 1966. A reporter interviewed her during a brief trip to New York to   CBS executives and affiliates. (“When they saw Mary, there was quite a bit of applause and a few whistles,” a network spokesman said.) By 1965 the show was a hit and Ms. Moore was a star. The writer Joanne Stang called her the “virtually uncontested popularity queen of weekly television,” marveling that Ms. Moore “has made housewifery a highly palatable pastime. ” “I guess they simply like me,” Ms. Moore said in the article. At the time she was preparing to try to leverage her TV success into a film career, having recently signed a contract with Universal. But she was similarly   about her prospects. “If I don’t have the chemistry for the big screen, I guess I’ll look for something else to do when the ‘Van Dyke Show’ goes off,” she said. Ms. Moore did appear in films like “Thoroughly Modern Millie,” “What’s So Bad About Feeling Good?” and “Change of Habit,” but it was another television show that became her defining role. “The Mary Tyler Moore Show,” which Ms. Moore produced with her   Grant Tinker, debuted in 1970, arriving in an era whose social mores were signified by the groaner headline The Times used to introduce it and other new   series: “Out of the Kitchen, Ladies. ” Early coverage was similarly dismissive: “Mary Tyler Moore is caught in a preposterous item about life as an ‘associate producer’ in a TV newsroom,” Jack Gould wrote in The Times in a preview of the 1970 TV season. In his brief review of “The Mary Tyler Moore Show,” Mr. Gould complained that the star was saddled with “one set of bizarre happenings at a TV station’s newsroom and another in her living accommodations. ” But within a few years, The Times had reconsidered its stance. “Consistently tight writing and good acting have made this situation comedy the best of its kind in the history of American television,” Dan Menaker wrote in 1973. The following year, The Times was revealing “Why 30 Million Are Mad About Mary. ” (The answer: She is “beautiful and sexy, but not threatening. ”) As the show wrapped up its run, during which it had broken ground in prime time with its depiction of a single professional woman, an Associated Press article in The Times noted that the show “laid to rest the myth that audiences would not accept a situation comedy involving a woman, unless she was married and burned dinner at least one night a week. ” “I’m just part of it,” Ms. Moore said in the article. “But it really has affected a lot of people, all to the good. ” Ms. Moore’s career never again reached the heights of “The Mary Tyler Moore Show,” but she stayed busy branching out into musicals and additional,   series, and playing against plucky type in TV movies and films like “Ordinary People” and “Flirting With Disaster. ” In the twilight of her career, as the lifetime achievement awards started rolling in, she embraced her signature role in lighthearted reunion specials and in the occasional interview. In 2012, Neil Genzlinger, a television critic for The Times, watched the series finale of “The Mary Tyler Moore Show” with the actress, who apologized in advance for a watery eye that had been plaguing her. “As we finished,” Mr. Genzlinger wrote, “Ms. Moore reached for the tissue box. ‘Now I am crying,’ she said. ‘It’s not just a bad eye. ’”"

The current hysteria about man-made global warming, which is focussed almost exclusively on carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, exceeds by a large margin any political movement any of us have experienced in our life time. Originating with a few long-term Green extremists and serial doom merchants in USA and Europe, it now engrosses the world’s politicians and media. Huge funds are being diverted to the cause, and the smell of easy money from carbon taxes, energy subsidies, carbon credits, mindless construction jobs and research funds has corrupted science, politics, industries, aid agencies, the media and whole nations.

"When you are traveling solo, it’s not always a breeze to strike up a conversation with a stranger. In fact, how do you meet other single travelers or locals in the first place? And if you’re looking for friendship  —   or even something more  —   how do you ensure that amid all the fun you don’t neglect to take safety precautions? Before we get to tactics, it’s helpful to know that you are likely to be rewarded for overcoming apprehensions about approaching someone new when you’re on the road. “Its easy to imagine all the ways things will go badly or believe that this person doesn’t want to connect,” said Nicholas Epley, a professor of behavioral science at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. But if you reach out, he continued, “almost everybody reaches back. ” Social scientists have found that making such connections, whether traveling or not, boosts happiness, and yet strangers in proximity “routinely ignore each other,” as Dr. Epley and his colleague Juliana Schroeder put it in the Journal of Experimental Psychology last year. During a series of nine experiments, they saw again and again that we underestimate other people’s interest in connecting. How to break the ice then? Dr. Epley suggests simply saying to that stranger on the bus or in the cafe: “Hi, I’m visiting. Can you tell me what I ought to see in town?” “Everybody loves to brag about their city,” he said. Or offer a compliment, he suggested. “I think you’re just best off in your relationships if you’re transparent with people. ” (This is not to gloss over any genuine concerns about talking to strangers, Dr. Epley said. But we’ll address those in a bit.) As experienced solo travelers know, opportunities for pleasurable connections are everywhere: trains, planes, parks, bars, museums, walking tours, group hikes. Yet should all that fail, technology provides seemingly innumerable ways to increase the odds. Obviously dating websites and apps like OkCupid and Tinder can facilitate     around the world. Yet the travel industry has its own tools, designed not specifically for romance, but for friendship. I’ve previously written about some of these websites and apps, including Highlight and Planely. The app Skout enables travelers to meet locals or one another wherever they are, be it a concert in London or a soccer game in Barcelona. More recently there’s Tripr, which allows travelers to find others who will be in the same place. But if you’re seeking a   companion, a couple of veteran sites deserve another look. Unlike a lot of   aimed at connecting travelers, Couchsurfing. com was founded in 2004 and has grown to some nine million members. You may know it as the purview of frugal travelers who see the world by sleeping on the couches and air mattresses of strangers, but it’s also a great way to meet other solo travelers and locals  —   even if you don’t crash on their couches. Some 120, 000 cities worldwide offer weekly Couchsurfing art gallery tours, hikes, dinners or gatherings in coffee shops and bars. (Becoming a member of the site is free.) In addition to joining events, you can also reach out to other members who have set their “hosting availability” status to “wants to meet up,” meaning that while their couch is unavailable, they’re happy to meet for coffee or be a resource while you’re visiting their city. Another digital stalwart is VirtualTourist. com, which offers tips and reviews from fellow globe trekkers and has been around since 1999. That means you’ll find a true online community, a deep well of people with whom to interact. Members have profiles that may include photos, their hometown, travel interests and where they’ve been. Each member’s travel tips are tied to his or her profile, and should you like what you read or have questions, you can message the user. Who knows, maybe you’ll even get together offline. Once you’re on the ground in a city, you can meet dozens of people at once by attending a cocktail hour, group run, or tour through the worldwide events site Meetup. com. While meeting someone new is exciting and can be deeply fulfilling, such overtures must be balanced with safety measures. Even Couchsurfing, which refers to strangers as “friends you haven’t met yet,” has a page devoted to safety, warning members to trust their instincts (“If a person, situation or profile seems unsafe for any reason, move on. Don’t worry about seeming rude”) and know their limits (“Partying like a rock star might be fun, but it puts your safety and   in the hands of others”). For women, especially, the site advises being educated about your destination’s cultural and religious norms and to “be clear about your boundaries and don’t be shy about stating them. ” At the same time, Dr. Epley said most people are not interested in taking advantage of you. “The person who wants to take advantage of you wants to find you immediately,” he explained. It’s different when you’re the one who decides to initiate a conversation. “When there’s random selection, you don’t have that risk of being targeted,” he said. Solo travelers are often told to keep friends and loved ones informed about where they’re going and when (including the time they expect to return) know which neighborhoods to avoid, and learn local emergency numbers. Additionally, consider registering with the nearest United States Embassy or consulate at Step. state. . This allows the embassy to reach you in an emergency (natural disaster, civil unrest) and family and friends to contact you if there’s an emergency. You may also want to memorize words such as “help,” “police” and “fire” in the local language, and have a plan for how you’ll get back to your hotel anytime you’re out after dark. If you are in a place where there’s no mass transit or if mass transit is not safe at night, have the number of a taxi service with you. If you use Uber, make sure the photo of the driver that appears on the app matches the face of the person who picks you up. Also, the Uber app has a “Share my ETA” option that allows you to send someone your whereabouts and estimated arrival time. (Before I even get into a car I send the driver’s name, car make and my destination to a friend or family member.) The fear of strangers has deep evolutionary roots. Do not, Dr. Epley said, disregard your intuition. “Our research does not suggest that you should talk to everybody that you meet or that you should have the volume turned up to 11 in all your social interactions,” he said. It’s just that for most of us, “the dial for engaging others seems set a little too low. Nudge it up. ”"

"**Alibaba chief executive Daniel Zhang has praised Hong Kong's ""bright"" future as the Chinese e-commerce giant prepares to list in the embattled financial hub.**
The firm, which is already traded in the US, hopes to raise up to $13.4bn (Â£10.4bn) in its secondary listing.
That would make it the biggest share sale this year, according to Dealogic.
The move is seen as a boost for Hong Kong, diluting fears that protests have tarnished its financial reputation.
The city has grappled with anti-government protests for nearly five months and violent clashes escalated this week .
""During this time of ongoing change, we continue to believe that the future of Hong Kong remains bright,"" Alibaba Chairman Daniel Zhang said.
He described the city as ""one of the world's most important financial centres"".
Mr Zhang - who succeeded Jack Ma to take Alibaba's top job earlier this year - said the company hoped to ""contribute"" to the future of Hong Kong.
The company will offer 500 million shares, priced at up to HK$188 ($24) each for retail investors. Shares are due to start trading on 26 November.
The sale could knock Uber off the top spot as this year's biggest IPO, according to Dealogic data. The ride-sharing firm raised $8.1bn in its New York float in May.
Over the years, Alibaba has grown from an online marketplace into an e-commerce giant with interests ranging from financial services to artificial intelligence.
The company said the new listing will allow investors across Asia to ""participate in Alibaba's growth,"" as it seeks to tap ""substantial new capital pools"" in the region.
The Hangzhou-based firm had originally considered a Hong Kong IPO in 2013, but opted for New York after failing to secure regulatory approval in the Asian territory.
The move to go ahead with the share sale in Hong Kong comes after Alibaba reportedly delayed plans to list there earlier this year, amid ongoing unrest and the US-China trade war.
The long-running protests have hurt the economy, which has fallen into recession, and knocked business confidence in the city.
The protests started in June against plans to allow extradition to the mainland - which many feared would erode the city's freedoms.
Hong Kong is part of China, but as a former British colony it has some autonomy and people have more rights.
While the extradition plans were withdrawn in September, the demonstrations have continued, with protesters calling for an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality, and democratic reform."

Guest essay by Eric Worrall
The Australian Journal of Pharmacy has just tried to link climate change, to the terrifying Zika Virus outbreak in South and Central America. The Zika Virus, a mosquito born disease, has been implicated in an upsurge of serious birth defects.
CLIMATE CHANGE COULD WORSEN DISEASES LIKE ZIKA VIRUS
The news of an outbreak of the Zika virus in South America is a grim reminder of the health hazards associated with a warming world, Climate and Health Alliance Executive Director Fiona Armstrong said today.
A study published in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases this week documents the spread of the virus in Columbia, while Brazil is experiencing the largest known outbreak of Zika virus, which is being linked to the deaths of babies affected by microencephaly, or abnormally small brains.
…
“Regions with increasing average temperatures are at increased risk of mosquito-borne diseases, as mosquitoes thrive in and move to warmer regions,” says Armstrong.

The abstract of the referenced study;
Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arthropodborne member of the genus Flavivirus of the Spondweni serocomplex and is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes (primarily Ae. aegypti in urban and periurban cycles). ZIKV emerged in Africa and has caused outbreaks of febrile disease that clinically resemble dengue fever and other arboviral diseases (1) but has been linked to neurologic syndromes and congenital malformation (2). Outbreaks have been reported in the Yap islands of the Federated States of Micronesia (3), French Polynesia (4), and Oceania; Brazil is currently experiencing the first reported local transmission of ZIKV in the Americas (5).
The future spread of ZIKV is unpredictable, but the history of ZIKV has been reminiscent of chikungunya virus (CHIKV), which reemerged in Africa and now circulates on all inhabited continents and is a major global health problem. ZIKV has been found in Colombia and is likely following the path of CHIKV, which reached the country in August 2014 (6). The virus co-circulates with other Ae. aegypti–transmitted arboviruses, including dengue virus (DENV) and yellow fever virus. We report ZIKV infection in Colombia and a recent ongoing outbreak in Sincelejo, Colombia, with resulting illness characterized by maculopapular rash, fever, myalgia/arthralgia, and conjunctivitis.
During October–November 2015, a total of 22 patients received a presumptive diagnosis of an acute viral illness by emergency department physicians at the Centro de Diagnostico Medico-Universidad de Sucre in Sincelejo. The patients began treatment for a dengue-like illness, and blood samples were obtained for diagnosis. The samples were analyzed at the Universidad de Sucre by using reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) to detect DENV, CHIKV, or ZIKV. Viral RNA was extracted from the serum samples by using the ZR Viral RNA Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA); reverse transcription was performed by using the Protoscript First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). Amplicons were produced by using the OneTaq Quick-Load 2X Master Mix (New England Biolabs) with primers specific to DENV (7), CHIKV (forward: 5′-CGCCAACATTCTGCTTACAC-3′; reverse: 5′-AGGATGCCGGTCATTTGAT-3′), and ZIKV. The CHIKV amplification target was 649 bp of nonstructural protein 1 (NS1). A positive PCR for a partial region of the envelope (E) gene with primers ZIKVENVF and ZIKVENVR (8) was considered indicative of ZIKV infection. ZIKV primers specific for the E gene and NS1 were designed and used to amplify the E gene and NS1 for phylogenetic analyses, and amplicons were produced by using the OneTaq One-Step RT-PCR Kit (New England Biolabs). E gene and NS1 PCR products were sequenced at the University of Wisconsin–Madison Biotechnology Center (Madison, WI, USA).

The tree was constructed on the basis of Bayesian phylogenetic analysis with 8 million generations and a general time-reversible substitution model using MrBayes software version 3.2 (http://mrbayes.sourceforge.net). Numbers to the right of nodes represent posterior p
Samples from all patients were negative by RT-PCR for DENV and CHIKV; samples from 9 (41%) patients were positive for ZIKV. Among those 9 patients, 7 (78%) were male; median age was 23; and none had a history of international travel. ZIKV was analyzed by sequencing the E gene and NS1 of 2 isolates. Phylogenetic analyses rooted with Spondweni virus showed that the ZIKV sequences belonged to the Asian lineage (Figure) and were closely related to strains isolated during the 2015 outbreak in Brazil (5). The sequences also showed 99% identity with sequences from a ZIKV isolate from French Polynesia (GenBank accession no. KJ776791) (9). These data suggest that ZIKV circulating in Colombia could have been imported from Brazil, most likely as a result of tourism activities on Colombia’s northern coast, where the first reported case was identified (the state of Bolivar).
We report ZIKV infection in Colombia in association with an ongoing outbreak of acute maculoexantematic illness. Since detection of ZIKV in Sincelejo, a total of 13,500 cases have been identified in 28 of the country’s 32 territorial entities (10), all of which have abundant populations of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes and co-circulation of DENV and CHIKV. These circumstances highlight the need for accurate laboratory diagnostics and suggest that monitoring whether the virus spreads into neighboring countries (e.g., Ecuador, Peru, Venezuela, and Panama) is imperative.

It is true that Aedes Aegypti, the mosquito which carries Zika, lives in tropical and subtropical regions. Global warming, if it occurs, might increase the range of Aegypti. But there are close relatives of Aegypti, such as Aedes Albopictus, which might be just as dangerous. Albopictus has a much greater range than Aegypti, but carries similar viral diseases to Aegypti. I don’t know whether Albopictus can carry Zika, but this has to be considered as a significant possibility.
Albopictus is currently spreading through temperate zones in Europe, and has been detected as far North as Germany.
Even if it turns out only Aegypti can carry Zika, I doubt the most efficient response to dangerous mosquito borne diseases is to build a few wind turbines.
A good start to controlling mosquito borne diseases, might be to remove the pointless bureaucratic obstacles to spraying DDT, one of the most effective anti-mosquito chemicals ever developed.
Use of DDT was almost outlawed after vigorous scare campaigns by green groups, but this much maligned chemical is harmless to humans. Professor Kenneth Mellanby, who campaigned for the use of DDT in the 1940s, used to eat a substantial pinch of concentrated DDT as part of his demonstration. Mellanby did not suffer any health problems from his massive consumption of DDT – he died in 1993, at the age of 85 years.
Part of the reason DDT was and is so popular in the third world, is DDT is very easy to produce, a simple one step reaction any backyard lab could perform. With a few litres of precursor chemicals, an amateur laboratory could produce enough DDT for thousands of treatments. I suspect if authorities don’t remove bureaucratic obstacles to DDT use, people in Zika affected regions might start cooking their own.

Dr. Thomas Karl recently retired as Director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
In 1989, Karl’s stated position was that global temperatures cooled between 1921 and 1979.  


Source: RealClimateScience
“Analysis of warming since 1881 shows most of the increase in global temperature happened before 1919 – before the more recent sharp rise in the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, said Thomas Karl of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Climatic Data Center in Asheville, N.C.   While global climate warmed overall since 1881, it actually cooled from 1921 to 1979, Karl said.”

Today, not only has the 1921-1979 cooling disappeared from NOAA’s official temperature record, it has been replaced by a +0.45°C warming trend during that nearly 60-year period.



1. Early NOAA Graphs Confirm Strong Cooling Through The 1970s – Before It Was Removed

As recently as the early 1980s, it was still widely accepted in the scientific community (National Academy of Sciences, hundreds of scientific papers) that the Northern Hemisphere had undergone a dramatic warming of nearly 1°C from about 1900 to 1940, and then, after the 1940s, the trend reversed to severe cooling, fomenting the 1970s global cooling scare.

Agee, 1980



NOAA’s Karl had also supplied plenty of evidence to support the original (1989) position that a global cooling trend persisted through the late 1970s.  Graphs appeared in his papers with strong warming trends through the 1920s and 1930s and then cooling trends from the 1940s to the 1970s.   For example, the NOAA graph of U.S. annual temperatures showed the cooling trend from 1921-1979, and even indicated there had been no net warming in the U.S. in the 90 years between 1895 and 1985.

Karl, 1988
U.S.A. (Annual Average)


Compare the graph above to the one below.  By starting their trend in 1901 rather than 1895 (as above from Karl, 1988), Karl and Jones (1989) could claim there was a net temperature increase of 0.16°C during the 20th century, or as of 1901-’84.  All of the 84-year warming occurred prior to the 1940s, and it only warmed overall because the post-1940s cooling didn’t quite eclipse the pre-1940s warming when the trend line started six years later (1901 vs. 1895).  The end point of the second trend (1984) is apparently 0.16°C warmer than where the first trend line began (1901).

Karl and Jones, 1989
“Temperature trends indicate an increasing temperature from the turn of the century to the 1930s but a decrease thereafter.”
“Over the twentieth century (1901-84) … the overall temperature trend in the United States during this time period, +0.16°C/84 yr.”

2. Case Example: NOAA Removes Strong Post-1940s Cooling Trend For Indiana (U.S.A.)

Like the hemispheric trend, this dramatic warming and cooling trajectory was found in the temperature record for much of the United States — before it was removed.  For example, Karl (NOAA) produced a graph showing there was a cooling of multiple degrees (°C) from the 1930s-1950s to the 1960s-1970s in central Indiana.  In fact, highest to lowest yearly anomalies reached more than 10°C, a warming-cooling separation of 18°F between the 1931 anomalous warmth and the mid-1970s cooling .

Karl and Riebsame, 1984


Today, NOAA has eliminated the multiple degrees of warming and cooling for Indiana, almost completely flattening out the earlier steep warming and cooling trends.


3. NOAA (1988, 1989): Artificial Heat From Urbanization Accounts For All 20th Century Warming

During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Karl was the lead author or co-author of several papers that affirmed urban temperature bias (locating temperature measuring stations near asphalt, buildings, airports, machinery, etc.) had compromised the U.S. temperature record and produced a substantial artificial warming.  The artificial warming bias identified in the temperature record was found to be larger than the overall temperature trend itself.  In other words, according to NOAA, all or nearly all the U.S. 20th century warming (through the mid-1980s) could be attributed to artificial (non-climatic) heating due to the effects of urbanization.

Karl and Quayle, 1988
“Karl et al., 1988) has shown that at some ‘sun belt’ cities in the West, the rise of temperature that can be attributed to the urban heat island is as much as 0.3 to 0.4°C per decade. In the East, the rise is over 0.1°C per decade. … The artificial warming in the primary station network, relative to the climate division data, is nearly 0.17°C over the past 34 years [since ~1950]. Such trends are at least as large as any of the observed trends over the United States (Karl, 1988) or the globe (Jones and Wigley, 1987).”

Karl and Jones, 1989
“Results indicate that in the United States the two global land-based temperature data sets have an urban bias between +0.1°C and +0.4°C over the twentieth century (1901-84).  This bias is as large or larger than the overall temperature trend in the United States during this time period, +0.16°C/84 yr.”
At present, only rough estimates of the potential impacts of urbanization can be given.  This includes an urban bias in the Hansen and Lebedeff (1987) [NASA] data over the United States between 0.3°C and 0.4°C over the 20th century, which is larger than the overall trend in the United States over this period. … To our knowledge, the United States is the only large area of the globe where the magnitude of this bias has been thoroughly studied.”
“The magnitude of this urban bias in two global, land-based data sets was found to be a substantial portion of the overall trend of global and regional temperatures.”

“Rapid increases in urbanization can lead to [warming] biases in the annual mean temperature at urban locations of over 1°C (Karl et al., 1988; Karl and Jones, 1989).”

Kukla, Gavin, and Karl, 1986
“Meteorological stations located in an urban environment in North America warmed between 1941 and 1980, compared to the countryside, at an average rate of about 0.12°C per decade.  Secular trends of surface air temperature computed predominantly from [urban] station data are likely to have a serious warm bias. … [W]e compared trends of the 34 urban/rural station pairs…urban stations show a warming with respect to the countryside throughout most of the year.  The average annual difference of the trends is about +0.11°C per decade [of non-climatic warming due to urban location]. … The average difference between trends [urban siting vs. rural] amounts to an annual warming rate of 0.34°C/decade.  Values from May through August averaged 0.44°C/decade while December showed the smallest difference. The reason why the warming rate in subset D is considerably higher [may be] that the rate may have increased after the 1950s, commensurate with the large recent growth in and around airports. … Our results and those of others show that the urban growth inhomogeneity is serious and must be taken into account when assessing the reliability of temperature records.”

4. NOAA (1989): Early Instrumental Records Have Up To 1°C Biases, Non-Uniform Calibration Standards

Karl et al., 1989
“Calibration errors are serious problems with early temperature records, some dating back to the seventeenth and 18th century.  Early thermometers consisted of a U tube with one open end and required pressure corrections.  Varying temperature measurement scales and instrument shelters were used.  Readings from these instruments are often difficult to interpret.  Temperature measurements over the last 100-140 years have been refined so that the accuracy and the precision of the measurement is at least [within] 0.5°C.”
“Changes in observing schedules and practices have been shown to produce biases in the mean temperature of up to 1°C (Bigelow, 1909; Schaal and Dale, 1977; Karl et al., 1986). Even today, there is not an international standard for the calculation of mean daily temperature, and archived data often include averages based on different formulae for calculating monthly means.”

5. NOAA (1989): Poor Coverage In Our Land Data – 1/3rd Of Land Area Has No Thermometer Within 1,200 Kilometers

Karl et al., 1989
“[There was] a large increase in [temperature measuring] stations from the late nineteenth century to the 1960s and a subsequent decline after the 1960s.”


6. NOAA (1989): ‘Uncomfortable Level Of Uncertainty’ In Our Sea Temperature Data – Poor Coverage, Large Measurement Biases

Karl et al., 1989
“[T]here are large geographic areas of the oceans which have not been adequately sampled, and even today, only two thirds of the global oceans are sampled in NOAA’s Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (COADS).  The tropical areas of the Pacific Ocean have few observations until the 1950s, and oceanic regions poleward of 40°S (which account for 15% of the world surface area) have few observations available until recent decades.  Even when observations are available for an individual grid box, there may be only one or two values for a given month, and adjustments may be required to convert the value to a midmonth or midarea equivalent. … [T]he poor spatial coverage in the tropical Pacific and southern oceans adds an uncomfortable level of uncertainty regarding long-term (50-100 years) changes of ocean temperatures.”
“For marine air temperatures, biases exist for a variety of reasons.  Ships have become larger over the years, and the height of the deck above sea level has increased.  As ships have become larger, their absorption of insolation has increased and caused a [warm] bias with respect to daytime observations of marine air temperature.”
“For sea surface temperature measurement, biases are known to be caused by changes in the vessel used to hold the seawater in which the temperature is measured.  Wooden buckets, metal buckets, canvas buckets, and intake tubes for engine cooling have all been used to measure sea surface temperature since the midnineteenth century. … The magnitude of the warm bias [in measuring sea temperatures] obtained using the modeling approach is similar to that obtained by comparison with the nighttime marine air temperatures (several tenths of a degree Celsius).  Differences among the types of buckets (for which the timing is uncertain) can translate into an uncorrected or uncorrectable bias of 0.1°C-0.2°C in the sea surface temperatures over the past century.”
“Oceanic measurements of sea temperature (i.e., data from research cruises) are … very poorly distributed for long-term global studies.  … In summary, with so few long-term observations of temperature over the oceans, particularly in the southern hemisphere, and the differing measurement practices, global and hemispheric time series extending into the nineteenth century should be used circumspectly.”

7. NOAA (1989): Surface Temperatures Can Be Raised Artificially By Moving/Eliminating Stations From Rural Locations

Karl et al., 1989
“Changes in station location, instruments, instrument shelters, and the height of instruments above the ground have led to biases of 1°C or more at many stations (Karl and Williams, 1987).”


8. NOAA (2012): To Be Reliable (‘Fact’), NOAA Temperature Records Should Be ‘Same’ As Satellite Records

Prior to the publication of his highly criticized 2015 paper that made the the nearly two-decade-long pause in global temperatures ‘disappear’ (by adjusting sea surface temperature data – cooling the past and warming the present), NOAA’s Karl was quoted saying (2012) that NOAA’s surface temperature trends should show the “same kind of a trend” as satellite temperatures do.  The agreement between NOAA surface instrumental data and satellite data would indicate that the temperature trend is fact, and not an assertion (his word choices).
However, with the adjustments to the data, the satellite records do not show the “same kind of a trend” as the NASA (NOAA) records do:

9. NOAA (1989): Comprehensive Coverage From Satellites ‘Striking’ – Will Likely Be Our Main Temperature Data Source

Back in 1989, NOAA’s Karl asserted that satellite data would soon be the “primary source” for climate change monitoring due to the “striking” coverage (85% of the Earth’s surface, observations every 30 minutes) satellites provide relative to the thermometric record.  In fact, he concluded that the eventual “marriage” of land data from temperature stations with satellite data would make the overall temperature record much more reliable.

Karl et al., 1989
“[S]pecial data sets from experiments and research projects are becoming available to climate researchers.  Some special data sets are also available from research satellites (such as the NOAA satellites) are likely to be the primary source of long-term data for monitoring climate change.  The operational satellite data record is now long enough to consider the statistical evaluation of changes of various climate variables.”
“Compared to ground-based data, the most striking characteristic of satellite data is its comprehensive geographic coverage. … Under normal circumstances, five geostationary satellites provide coverage for about 85% of the Earth’s surface.  … The geostationary satellites make routine observations every 30 min and are capable of scanning limited latitude bands at shorter intervals.”
“The marriage of space-based satellite observations with traditional surface-based observations with traditional surface-based observations offers the potential to significantly reduce our uncertainties in the climate record.”

10. How They Do It: NOAA In-Fills Unmeasured Land (And Sea) Regions With Made-Up Temperatures

The exposed “Climategate” e-mails from overseers of surface temperature data (for example, Phil Jones of the Climate Research Unit) have authentically established that there is a history of scientists making up data and “correcting” cooling temperatures (the “decline”) to satisfy an agenda.  The e-mails reveal that scientists are not above artificially removing “the 1940s blip” (that showed too much warming to be compatible with models) or the post-1960s trend (cooling, the “decline”) and making up their own “raw” temperatures when they can.  Here are a few sample excerpts from the purloined exchanges.





Because the temperature data coverage is so exiguous (i.e., Southern Hemisphere ocean temperatures are “mostly made up”), NOAA has to in-fill the vast non-measured land regions (that contain no thermometers) across the globe with their own numbers derived from modeling.
And because modeling presumes that anthropogenic CO2 emissions drive temperatures, and emissions have exploded since the mid-1940s, there is a modeling bias to cool down the 1920s to 1940s warmth, heat up the 1940s to 1970s cooling trend, and exaggerate the most recent warming.  This way, the overall trend will look more and more like the linear emissions post-1940s “hockey stick” trend, and less like the undulating pattern that was scientifically acceptable until the 1980s.
The land area with adequate temperature records available (containing both maximum and minimum uniform daily temperatures) is still woefully absent in regions such as Greenland, Antarctica, Africa, South America, Central America, and most of Asia, Canada, and Scandinavia.  The only regions with good coverage are the U.S., Europe, Australia, and China.  This doesn’t even include the dearth of coverage for the ocean surfaces, which is even worse.
In a NCDC/NOAA analysis by Peterson and Vose (1997), it was revealed that raw data with the uniform maximum/minimum daily temperatures available from the Global Historical Climatology Network have improved in the last century, but not enough to provide confidence in available global-scale records.

Peterson and Vose, 1997 (NCDC/NOAA)


Indeed, NOAA’s lack of adequate observational land coverage – real temperature measurements – is illustrated below.  The gray areas effectively contain no thermometric record, meaning the temperatures in those regions must be made up.  Keep in mind that the red-blue colored squares used to represent real measurements tend to exaggerate the coverage, as the square sizes depict a larger range of coverage than actual.



Conclusion

The global temperature dataset available from NOAA suffers from massive and uncorrected warm biases (as preferred by its purveyors), woefully inadequate contemporary measurement coverage, and even worse historical coverage (with inherently non-uniform data collection methodologies).  Consequently, a substantial portion of the temperature data available from NOAA should be regarded as artificial and untrustworthy.  Those who faithfully uphold NOAA’s global temperature dataset as “truth” will need to address its demonstrable speciousness – and why they are inclined to believe in it anyway.

"KABUL, Afghanistan  —   The attorney general of Afghanistan has ordered the arrest of nine   bodyguards over accusations of rape and torture made by a political rival, and the vice president himself remains under investigation, officials said on Tuesday. The arrest warrants, confirmed by the attorney general’s office, came after Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum, the more senior of Afghanistan’s two vice presidents, and his bodyguards refused to show up for questioning about the allegations, despite repeatedly being summoned by prosecutors. The case is testing the government’s resolve to deliver justice in the face of a potentially dangerous showdown between a powerful former warlord and the shaky coalition administration of which he is a part. Ahmad Ishchi, a    elder from General Dostum’s own Uzbek ethnic group, has accused the vice president of abducting him from a sports stadium in November, personally and repeatedly beating him, and ordering his men to sexually assault him with an assault rifle during five days of captivity in the northern province of Jowzjan. Attorney General Mohammad Farid Hamidi declined to discuss the case in detail on Tuesday but said that his prosecutors were focused on enforcing the law with precision. “We are following the law in this case hair by hair,” Mr. Hamidi said. President Ashraf Ghani has said that he takes the allegations against General Dostum seriously and that the case will be handled fairly within the judicial system to show that no one is above the law. Mr. Ghani has told Western diplomats that he is tired of officials breaking the law with impunity, and he characterized the Dostum case as a    challenge to his government. But many have said that Mr. Ghani shares the blame for bringing General Dostum onto his ticket in the first place, despite grave concerns about the former warlord’s human rights record. Spokesmen and aides to General Dostum could not be reached for comment about the warrants on Tuesday, but in recent weeks, they have rejected the summons against him as unconstitutional. Bashir Ahmad Tayanj, a spokesman for General Dostum, said last month that the allegations were baseless and that the vice president had constitutional immunity from prosecution as part of the president’s elected ticket. In recent weeks, however, senior government officials say General Dostum’s aides have been in contact with the attorney general’s office, where they have been clearly told that the vice president has no choice but to cooperate. The general’s aides have asked for time, two senior officials said. Mr. Ishchi welcomed the news of the warrants and insisted that the bodyguards be arrested immediately. But he said justice would only be served once General Dostum’s fate had been made clear. “Dostum committed an obvious crime, and when the crime is evident, the government can arrest the criminal even if he is a very   person,” he said. General Dostum is part of a generation of Afghan warlords who stand accused of human rights violations, mostly during the country’s civil war in the 1990s. But until now, most of those figures have seemed immune to the consequences, remaining in positions of power. Before issuing the summons for General Dostum, the attorney general sought the support of Mr. Ghani and the national security council, which includes all the security ministries. A detailed plan of action was discussed at a meeting of the council, at which all the agencies pledged support for the prosecutors. General Dostum’s supporters have insisted that Mr. Ishchi was not abducted but, rather, arrested by security forces on charges of aiding the Taliban in Jowzjan Province. “Force, injury, and mistreatment  —   we cannot deny that, because in the past these accusations have been there against Afghan forces, that they mistreat suspects during arrest and interrogation,” Mr. Tayanj said in the interview last month. But he denied the accusation of sexual assault. Both sides have also made emotional appeals to the public on the nightly news. On one news program, Mr. Tayanj presented a medical document that he said was from a government forensics examination he said it disproved Mr. Ishchi’s assertions of sexual assault but did not go into detail, simply brandishing the paper. A day later, Mr. Tayanj allowed two New York Times reporters to examine the document. It stated that there had been a wound next to Mr. Ishchi’s rectum but that it had been treated, making it difficult to determine what had caused it. Two other medical reports seen by The Times also attest to the presence of a significant wound. One was written by doctors at the United States military air base in Bagram, the other by doctors at the   Wazir Akbar Khan hospital, in Kabul. When the reporters pressed Mr. Tayanj about the wound, he said it was not evidence of sexual assault. “If someone hits someone with a rifle, no matter where they hit, is that sexual assault? Sexual assault has its own specific meaning,” Mr. Tayanj said. “They have made it seem as if he was an    girl who was taken and done something wrong to. ” Aides to General Dostum have called for traditional mediation by tribal elders to resolve the issue, flatly rejecting the judicial process. He is also said to have sent a delegation of elders to negotiate with Mr. Ishchi. Baktash Ishchi, one of Mr. Ishchi’s sons, said that they insisted on following the legal process and would not engage in traditional mediation. “This is not an issue for traditional mediation  —   it is not like he took our camel, so we accept a horse in return,” he said. “There is a crime that has taken place. ”"

Synchronized leaf aging in the Amazon responsible for seasonal increases in photosynthesis
High-tech photography in the Amazon reveals that young leaves grow in at the same times as older ones perish
Pictures like this one, taken from special cameras installed on towers above the rainforest canopy, recorded the changes in hundreds of individual tree crowns over the seasons in three different forests across the central Amazon. CREDIT Aline Lopes, INPA (National Institute of Amazonian Research).
UPTON, NY-One hundred and fifty feet above the ground in the Amazonian rainforest, a vast ocean of green spreads out in every direction. The rainforest canopy is made up of mostly tropical evergreen trees, which take in enormous amounts of carbon from Earth’s atmosphere. Understanding the carbon cycle in these forests – how carbon is stored in plants and soil and then returned to the atmosphere – is crucial to creating accurate models that predict how global climate will change in the future. Key to that puzzle is understanding photosynthesis in tropical forests.
“We want to understand whether photosynthesis in tropical evergreen forests is driven primarily by seasonal climate or by the internal dynamics of the rainforest,” said Jin Wu, a post-doctoral research associate at the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Brookhaven National Laboratory. Wu is the lead author on a study completed while he was a Ph.D. student with senior author Scott Saleska, Associate Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Arizona, published online in the February 26 issue of Science.
Wu, together with other members of Scott Saleska’s lab and international collaborators from Brazil, Australia, and Japan found that new leaf growth is synchronized with old leaf loss in the dry-season of the Amazon rainforest. This shifts the makeup of the tree canopy towards younger leaves, which display higher photosynthetic capacity, and explains the large observed seasonal increases in photosynthesis throughout the ecosystem.
Climate models have long represented the tropics in an overly simplistic way, often due to the lack of data from these hard to reach regions. That view assumed that tropical forests have consistent canopy greenness throughout the year–unlike the dramatic seasonal changes in temperate forests, heralded by vibrant reds and yellows.
“At the landscape level, it always looks evergreen,” Wu said. But broad-scale images–for example, those taken by satellites–often can’t discern the ground level subtleties that have a large impact on the level of photosynthesis. “Evergreen doesn’t mean there are no internal dynamics,” Wu said.
Seeing the trees through the forest
To better examine the impact of these internal dynamics on photosynthesis, Wu and his colleagues used all available data from four sites in the Amazon with a wide range of tree species, rainfall gradients, and soil types: three spots near the equator along the Amazon River, and one water-limited site on the southern side of the Amazon.
At these sites, the researchers measured variables that allowed them to calculate the aggregated photosynthesis rate across the whole forest. They found that the derived photosynthetic capacity from these measurements is seasonal. That is, though the forest is evergreen, the internal photosynthetic machinery changes throughout the year.
To determine what caused these changes, they used tower-mounted cameras perched over the treetops to survey a plot about a third of a mile square, observing the changing quantities and qualities of leaves in the canopy crowns. They found that leaf area increased significantly during the dry season, but these increases precede photosynthetic capacity by at least 1 month, which is increased twice as much as would have been expected from the increase in leaf area alone.
“It’s not just the quantity of leaves that makes a difference. In tropical evergreen forests, the overall quantity of leaves doesn’t change that much, so the quality of leaves is an important driver in photosynthesis,” Wu said.
Leaf age matters
To investigate the quality of the leaves, expert tree climbers accompanied the researchers as they trekked into the jungle, scaling the trees to tag individual leaves from the time they emerge and take photographs weekly and then monthly. This work revealed important changes in leaf biophysical and physiological properties through their life cycles.
“Photosynthesis is like a metabolism,” Wu said. “As human beings, our metabolic rates are strongly age-dependent. Leaves are similar. During their first two months, leaves expand and acquire more chlorophyll, becoming greener.” But Wu and his team found that leaves don’t reach their photosynthetic peak until they are fully expanded at two to five months old. At that point, they are more efficient in absorbing light and more efficient in converting light to food — that is, stored carbon. After six months, their photosynthetic rates decline as they enter ‘old’ age.
The effect of leaf age on physiology explained the surprisingly high seasonal changes in photosynthetic capacity.
Wu said that incorporating these details about tropical evergreen leaves into earth system models will allow for more accurate predictors of carbon exchange and, ultimately, their feedbacks to climate.
Taking the Tropics Into Account
“Tropical rainforests are biologically really important, but our understanding is so limited because the available data is very limited,” Wu said.
He is continuing his PhD research as a post-doc in a program designed to remedy the paucity of data from this region, the Next Generation Ecosystem Experiments – Tropics (NGEE-Tropics). This project is supported by the DOE Office of Science and led by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory’s Earth Sciences Division with partner institutes including Brookhaven.
NGEE-Tropics is an ambitious 10-year project to dramatically reduce the uncertainty in climate models and increase scientific understanding of how tropical forest ecosystems will respond to climate and atmospheric change.
Wu was recently in Panama, getting up close and personal with the rainforest. Together with Brookhaven scientists Kim Ely, Shawn Serbin, and Alistair Rogers, he is studying the impact of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on the response of photosynthesis to drought, and building relationships between important physiological properties that drive model uncertainty and other observations.
“If we want to advance our understanding about the terrestrial carbon cycle in tropical forests, we need to know what types of leaves are present at what times of year, and their physiological properties,” he said. “We can improve our models with this data, and better understand what to look for in the future with remote sensing from tower-mounted cameras, aircraft, and satellites.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman Klagermauer TV here shows a recent presentation made by veteran climatologist Prof. Dr. Werner Kirstein, in the lead up to the Marrakesh climate conference.

Prof. Dr. Werner Kirstein calls climate protection a form of populism where governments hope to garner praise for their climate protection efforts. Image cropped from Klagemauer TV. 
Kirstein has become an outspoken critic of the manmade global warming science. In his presentation, he explains in layman terms how the climate system works and why the often ballyhooed climate catastrophe is mostly “media propaganda”.
At the start, the 40-year climate science veteran explains how today’s climate is nothing unusual when taken in a historical context, and shows that previous interglacials were even warmer than the current one. Climate is a highly variable system and changes, even sudden ones, are nothing unusual. Another point he makes while explaining climate history is that CO2 rises always followed temperature rises, and not vice versa. Over history there has been very little correlation between CO2 concentration and global temperature.
Warming today not surprising, mostly natural
Kirstein maintains that the warming over the past decades has been mostly due to natural causes associated with the climb out of the Little Ice Age, and therefore is not surprising.
At the 17-minute mark he slams the greenhouse heat trapping theory, as it is taught today. Kirstein says the CO2 acts to diffuse long wave radiation from the earth and that the heat should appear at the mid to the upper troposphere, and not the earth’s surface. He says that the greenhouse effect as presented to the public has already been theoretically refuted and “falsified” by Tscheuchner and Gerlich.
At the 19-minute mark he says that there is indeed a greenhouse effect, but not the sort that heats the climate. Rather CO2 has a greening effect, as it serves as food for plants and in this aspect is positive for the planet. Plants grow optimally when concentrations are quadrupled (for C3 plants).
Observations have diverged from model projections
At the 25;20 mark Kirstein looks at the global warming temperature projections for the future, and says global temperatures have fallen way short of these projections. In the presentation he slams Al Gore for cherry-picking and inappropriately and unrealistically extrapolating trends out into the future when knowing full well that the chaotic climate system in fact doesn’t behave that way.
Media has hyped climate change

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




Professor Kirstein also criticizes the media for hyping the natural climate changes, reminding viewers that earlier they had warned in the 1970s of a coming ice age, before turning on a dime a decade later and predicting a sea level rise that would soon submerge half of the Cologne Cathedral. “They were making people crazy with it.” He adds at the 34:30 mark that the German media has lost credibility on the subject.
2°C target is nonsense
At the 32:30 mark he calls the 2°C target set by policymakers “nonsense”. Also the claims made by the German media that the Sahara Desert is expanding get refuted by Kirstein when he shows at the 35:50 mark how the Sahara is in fact shrinking. Kirstein slams a variety of tricks that the media use to mislead viewers.
At the 40:00 mark Kirstein presents a chart of Germany’s mean temperature over the past 28 years and asks where the warming is. The trend is behaving opposite to what was projected to happen!

Germany has not seen any warming in 3 decades! Chart: Josef Kowatsch, image from Klagemauer TV.
According to Kirstein, “Not a single model predicted the cooling of the last decade.”
At 44:00 Kirstein explains that climate has to be observed for minimum 30 years, better 50, or even 100, before one can draw conclusions. Making claims on events that occur over a period of only a few years “is a joke”, he says.
Some methods “bordering on fraud”
Later he shows that weather extremes such as cyclones show no trend. “No significant statistical trend at al over the past 40 years.” He labels “unserious scientific methods” used by climatologists as being “marginal in the least, at times false, and some even bordering on fraud.”
He slams German ZDF television at 50:00 for sloppy reporting in their failure to properly research sea level rise as related to tectonic plate movement in a show on sea level rise for Micronesia broadcast in 2009. Throughout the presentation Kirstein dispels of one media climate panic scenario after another — everything from polar bears in the Arctic to sea ice at the South Pole. The media often present future scenarios as fact and so misinform their audiences.
At the end Kirstein blasts how the state controlled media has in effect politicized the science. He says climate protection is now a form of populism where governments hope to garner praise for their climate protection efforts. At the end he quotes Danish astrophysicist Henrik Svensmark: “It has nothing to do with science”.

Satire.



Sorry, New Zealanders, but we have a major problem. In fact, the whole of planet Earth has a major problem. The problem is refugees. We can no longer stick our heads in the sand and pretend that it is nothing to do with us. We need to act now before we lose control and are completely overrun.



What am I referring to? Well, it is obvious. Betelgeuse.



The stargazers among you may be aware that Betelgeuse, part of the constellation of Orion, has been behaving very strangely lately. Even from Earth, it can be seen to be much dimmer than usual, resulting in astrophysicists concluding that it is turning into a supernova. As we know, these things happen on a regular basis, but the real issue is – what happens to all the Betelgeusians?



Betelgeuse has gone out of the main sequence and is burning helium into silicon & oxygen. The silicon is making the locals have terrible coughing fits. It is clear that they will soon be facing complete annihilation, and that something must be done to help the 100 billion inhabitants of its solar system.



Applications for asylum have been made by the leaders of Betelgeuse to a number of heavenly bodies, among them Mars, Jupiter and Earth. Our own prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, was the first to put up her hand to assist and has cleared all of the current refugees out of the Mangere refugee centre, awaiting the arrival of about 10 million Betelgeusians. It is understood that Rocket Lab is currently working on building suitable spacecraft to meet them halfway. The main issue involved with the relocation from Betelgeuse is the time difference, as the planet is approximately 700 light-years away from Earth. To put that in perspective, what we are now seeing probably happened around the time of the Hundred Years War, the rise of the Ottoman Empire, and the Black Death. (Thank goodness there are some similarities there, and the Betelgeusians will not be put off by our coronavirus.) This has not deterred Jacinda however, nor Justin Trudeau or Emmanuel Macron. **“Know Us By Our Deeds”** , they all say.



Nevertheless, something needs to be done, as it is a refugee crisis of astronomical proportions. Betelgeusians are currently boarding spacecraft, while charity ships from Earth and Mars sail around the universe, picking up as many stray Betelgeusians in leaky craft as possible to bring them back to Earth. Of course, these will be climate change refugees, because supernova has that effect. But warming through carbon dioxide? Whatever. By comparison to the effect of a supernova, well.. CO2 makes about as much difference as Kiwibuild.



As the leader of the government that brought kindness back, if Jacinda can do her bit to save the universe, she will.



The likely problems with integrating Betelgeusians with Earthlings and Martians are, to date, unknown. We know nothing about their religions, or if there are any oppressed Betelgeusians among them. We have no idea what a trans-Betelgeusian will look like. Actually, we have no idea what any Betelgeusian will look like. Nevertheless, provision is to be made on the spacecraft for safe spaces and gender-neutral toilets, and the craft themselves will be painted in rainbow colours, to make sure inclusivity is paramount. No Betelgeusian doing Greenface will be rescued, and straight, white ones will be the last on board the spacecraft. They have ruled their world for far too long.



United Nations warns us that this is a Betelgeusian crisis of universal proportions and that everything must be done to see that all those affected maintain all of their Betelgeusian rights, such as housing, food, sanitary products and crayons, if they need them.



UPDATE: After extensive negotiations with Earth’s leaders, particularly Ardern, Trudeau and Macron, Betelgeuse’s leaders have declined the offers to take any refugees from the region of the imploding star, because, in their opinion, there appears to be no intelligent life on Earth.



FURTHER UPDATE: the crisis is over. It seems that Betelgeuse has now stopped dimming, and is no longer in imminent danger of becoming a supernova. However, it is a dying star, and will almost certainly implode in the next 100,000 years or so. If Betelgeuse does blow up in our lifetime, we will have plenty of warning, as instruments on earth will start to detect neutrinos or gravitational waves generated by the explosion at least a day in advance. But with a delay time of about 700 years, I suggest we look to upgrade the instruments. You have to admit, that is quite a delay, and will cause a lot of operational issues with getting the refugees out of the area.



But for now, there is no need to panic. We can go back to merely bringing the population of the whole of the African continent into Western countries, as we were doing before.



(The geeks amongst you will know what I am talking about. For the others, [here is some](https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/what-will-a-betelgeuse-supernova-look-like-from-earth) further reading.)

Perhaps I ought to post a [View From Your Window](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/03/the-bfd-view-from-your-window-51/) photo, as it’s absolutely bucketing outside my window, right now. In fact, it’s right Flannerying down. The water tank’s overflowing, the pond’s near its brim and there are standing puddles everywhere.



A “Flannery”, as columnist **Tim Blair** describes it, is when Australia is drenched in the sort of rain that eminent climate hysteric **Tim Flannery** assured us we would never see again. When the dams that Flannery flatly stated would never fill again are full to bursting, they’re said to be “Thunberging”.



Many millimetres of Flannery continue to fall across NSW and all of our dams are Thunberged. The latest Flannery is so extensive that it’s extinguished remaining bushfires: The NSW Rural Fire Service on Monday announced that for the first time since July 2019 there were no active fires burning in NSW[…]Happily, much of that Flannery has fallen in and around NSW dams – Thunberging every single one of them.



The only thing wrong with this massive Flannery sweeping the nation is that climate-botherers who expect us to believe that they can accurately predict the climate centuries into the future are pretty much pants at predicting even a few months ahead.



Another summer has come and gone and with it much of the credibility of the Bureau of Meteorology’s climate modelling that has once again been shown to be worthy of fish and chip wrapping and not much else[…]



In late spring the BoM published its rolling series of climate predictions for the season ahead. On November 29, the seers at the BoM read the entrails and declared:



Drier than average summer likely for eastern Australia, but wetter for parts of the west coast. For summer as a whole (December to February), the dry signal contracts to the eastern States. Conversely, much of the western WA coastline has a slightly increased chance of above average rainfall in summer.



On December 5, they repeated this headline prophecy:



Drier than average January to March 2020 likely for eastern Australia, but wetter for parts of Western Australia.



As proof that its soothsaying powers rivalled the Great Predicto himself, the BoM published a handy map of just where the rain wasn’t going to fall. The map at right shows exactly where the rain **did** fall.



See any correlations with the predictions of three months earlier? Nor do I! The reality was about as close to the polar opposite of the prediction as one could possibly imagine.



Where there’s a laughably wrong climate claim, you’ll always find the ABC merrily honking its clown car with the rest of the parade of fools.



Not to be outdone, the ABC in its relentless mission to proselytise the anthropogenic global warming doomsday cult ran this horror story across its media platforms on Monday; Summers are now twice as long as winters in all Australian capital cities, report finds. What followed was a laughable sham of pseudo-science[…]We were then informed that two researchers crunched BoM numbers to find that apparently summers are now twice as long as winters in all Australian capital cities. Clearly, they haven’t spent much time in Melbourne or Hobart in recent times.



So, after I got soaked to the skin bringing the bins in this morning, excuse me if I treat the entrail-reading of the Cult of Gaia with some healthy scepticism.



Now, I’m going to put on something warm, put the Cure’s gloomy masterpiece, _Pornography_ , or maybe the Jesus and Mary Chain’s _Darklands_ , and enjoy watching the Flannery come down.

Dear Editor



The _Sunday Star Times_ ‘ editor **Tracy Watkins** went to some breast-beating length in last Sunday’s edition to explain why her paper is “staying neutral”. On politics, that is.



But in another equally topical and important field, Stuff’s attitude is this:



“Stuff accepts the overwhelming scientific consensus that climate change is real and caused by human activity. We welcome robust debate about the appropriate response to climate change, but do not intend to provide a venue for denialism or hoax advocacy.” 



This in spite of statements by such as **Michael Crichton** : 



“There is no such thing as consensus science. If it’s consensus, it isn’t science. If it’s science, it isn’t consensus. Period.”



Or the UK’s influential Financial Times: 



“Science is the pursuit of truth, not consensus”.



I am one of those that editor Tracy Watkins accuses of “denialism or hoax advocacy”. I do not deny that climate changes: it’s what climate does, and has been doing since Earth was formed all those billions of years ago, in natural cycles largely determined by the Earth’s orbits around the Sun. But I do agree current climate propaganda is a hoax, enriching the Al Gores of this world, and inflating the egos of political alarmists like Minister **James Shaw** , when there is not one single paper, by the proper scientific method, that shows that emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) can or do cause variation in temperatures outside natural cyclical limits long observed and recorded. (Our Coalition’s Augie Auer prize of $10,000, still unclaimed, awaits anyone who can cite such a paper).



 _Sunday Star Times_ editor **Tracy Watkins** would serve her readers more truly, and fulfil the principles enunciated by legendary Manchester Guardian editor C.P. Scott: “Comment is free, but facts are sacred”, by joining our call for an independent expert review of climate science before we wreck the primary production economy on which New Zealand is so dependent, and revert our modern comfortable lifestyle and preferred transport modes more to what the cave people had to ensure. After all, the precautionary principle works in both directions.



Terry Dunleavy MBE, 



Honorary Secretary  
New Zealand Climate Science Coalition

"**The Little Mermaid statue, one of the best-known attractions in Denmark's capital Copenhagen, has been spray-painted with a ""Free Hong Kong"" slogan.**
The words were found daubed in red and white on the rock the mermaid sits on.
It is just the latest incident in a long history of vandalism suffered by the tourist site.
Since first being put up more than 100 years ago, she has been decapitated, covered in graffiti and banned from Facebook over nudity.
The mermaid overlooking the waters at the port of Copenhagen is particularly popular with Chinese tourists.
In 2010, the 175kg (385lb) bronze statue was part of Denmark's pavilion at the World Exhibition in Shanghai.
Hong Kong has been gripped by months of protests demanding more democracy and less control from Beijing.
Created in tribute to the Danish storyteller Hans Christian Andersen, the mermaid has overlooked the entrance of the Copenhagen harbour since 1913 and over time has become a world-famous icon of the city.
Yet she has not enjoyed a quiet life. In 1964, her head was hacked off for the first time, never to be found.
Since then, one arm and the (replaced) head again have suffered the same fate while an explosion once knocked her off her rock into the water.
She has also been frequently sprayed with paint and graffiti, been covered with a burqa and banned from Facebook for breaching nudity guidelines.

"WASHINGTON  —   Scientists and environmentalists reacted with fear this week as the Trump administration purged nearly all mention of climate change programs from the White House and State Department websites and ordered a freeze on federal grant spending at the Environmental Protection Agency and other government agencies. Memos ordered employees of at least four agencies not to send out news releases or to create social media posts, blog entries or official website content, and to consult with senior officials before speaking to the news media. Such memos or oral communications landed this week at the E. P. A. and the Departments of the Interior, Agriculture and Health and Human Services, in a broad halt to external communications while the Trump administration struggles to put political appointees into position. Small   of communications  —   apparently in dissent  —   appeared on Twitter, but they were quickly stopped. The Twitter posts of the social media division of the Badlands National Park broadcasting the threat of climate change became something of a cause célèbre before they disappeared from the platform on Tuesday. A White House spokesman, Sean Spicer, attributed those Twitter posts to a former park employee who had commandeered the park’s account. Longtime employees at three of the agencies  —   including some career environmental regulators who conceded that they remained worried about what President Trump might do on policy matters  —   said such orders were not much different from those delivered by the Obama administration as it shifted policies from the departing White House of George W. Bush. They called reactions to the agency memos overblown. On Wednesday, Douglas Ericksen, a spokesman for the E. P. A. said that grants had been only briefly frozen for review, and that they would be restarted by Friday. “I’ve lived through many transitions, and I don’t think this is a story,” said a senior E. P. A. career official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the news media on the matter. “I don’t think it’s fair to call it a gag order. This is standard practice. And the move with regard to the grants, when a new administration comes in, you run things by them before you update the website. ” But the White House and State Department did delete nearly all mentions of climate change policy  —   which had been a top priority for Mr. Obama  —   and have begun replacing them with pages detailing Mr. Trump’s plans to roll back those policies  —   a top priority for the new president. It is standard practice for new administrations to make changes to their websites to reflect their different policy positions. The full contents of the Obama administration’s White House and State Department websites, including working links to climate change reports, have been archived and are readily available to the public. But environmental advocates and Democrats took advantage of the moves, noting that they appeared to target agencies that focus on environmental protection and scientific research, and calling them a chilling signal that the Trump administration intends to suppress communication about science and environmental policy, and possibly scientific data. If nothing else, the memos and ensuing reaction furthered the impression of turmoil throughout the government as Mr. Trump tries to assert control. Scientists said that even if no climate or other scientific data has been deleted from government websites, they remain fearful that it could be. Mr. Ericksen wrote in an email on Wednesday that the Trump administration team is now “reviewing” the E. P. A. ’s climate change page for changes. “People can’t tell whether data is being purged or not  —   it’s a confused situation,” said Michael Oppenheimer, a climate scientist at Princeton University and a member of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which supplies scientific reports to world governments. “If the Trump administration doesn’t want rumor, invective and anxiety running amok, they should get out there and say publicly and firmly that they believe in science and have no intention of hiding science from the public. And they haven’t done that,” Mr. Oppenheimer said. Environmentalists also criticized what appeared to be a Twitter war between some Interior Department employees and their new bosses, as the agency appeared to delete Twitter posts by National Park Service employees that highlighted the smaller attendance at Mr. Trump’s inauguration than at Barack Obama’s 2009 inauguration, as well as facts about climate change. Rebellious posts on social media became so plentiful from so many obscure sites that the management of the Interior Department appeared powerless to find them all. The Golden Gate National Park tweeted out concerns over a warming planet. After the Badlands Twitter posts were taken down, employees at the Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural Site in Buffalo ended Tuesday evening by quoting the first President Roosevelt on free speech  —   “a necessity in any country where the people are free. ” But it is far from clear how realistic the response has been. The Agriculture Department memo to employees was modeled after one written by Tom Vilsack, President Barack Obama’s agriculture secretary. “In order for the department to deliver unified, consistent messages, it’s important for the office of the secretary to be consulted on media inquiries and proposed responses to questions related to legislation, budgets,   policy issues and regulations,” wrote Mr. Vilsack, a former Democratic governor of Iowa, in 2009. “  statements should not be made to the press without notifying or consulting with the office of the secretary. ” Michael Young, the acting deputy secretary of the Agriculture Department, who has worked as a career civil servant in the department for 33 years, wrote a memo to employees telling them to consult the secretary’s office when responding to news media inquiries, and he said the memo was little different than the one that was issued during the transition to Mr. Obama’s administration. “This memo is not some sort of creative writing exercise,” he said. “This is almost exactly what was issued eight years ago. I just updated it a bit. ” Asked about the memos at a news briefing on Tuesday, Mr. Spicer said, “I don’t think it’s any surprise that when there’s an administration turnover that we’re going to review the policies. ”"
"Gas companies have touted their lobbying efforts to get pipeline and infrastructure projects on the radar of the commission advising the federal government on coronavirus recovery. The National Covid-19 Coordination Commission’s manufacturing taskforce discussions were reportedly “completely dominated” by the gas sector, and the body ultimately recommended the government should underwrite investment in new pipelines. Blue Energy, an exploration company with an estimated 3,000 petajoule gasfield in Queensland’s Bowen Basin, has been attempting to gain government support for a pipeline that would connect its tenements near Moranbah to the east coast. The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, announced last week the state would pay $5m for a feasibility study of the Moranbah pipeline. In its quarterly update to investors on 30 June, Blue Energy said it and two other companies – pipeline proponent APA and Arrow Energy – had been “working with” the coronavirus recovery commission and anticipated support from the federal government would be announced soon. “Blue continues to work with the [commission] to prioritise new gas supply for eastern Australia manufacturing and, in particular, the 15,000 petajoules of gas resource contained in the north Bowen Basin gas province,” the update to shareholders said.  “It is envisaged that there will be announcements forthcoming from the prime minister’s office … on this gas infrastructure and gas supply for the east coast, so that reliable long term gas supply is available for manufacturing to give certainty to manufacturers to plan for long overdue plant upgrades.” The general manager of major projects at the gas and pipeline company Jemena, Jonathan Spink, said recently he was “forecasting a pretty big order book over the next few years”. In an interview with the Australian Gas and Pipelines Association, Spink said the industry needed government support. “We need government to help us. They need to stop saying gas is bad and go along with the science and work with us.” The Queensland energy minister, Anthony Lynham, said the state had been pursuing the federal government to invest in gas infrastructure. “Queensland has been doing the heavy lifting on gas policy and supply for several years, facilitating exploration and development where the gas is guaranteed to the domestic market,” Lynham said. “Queensland has an economic strategy for recovery and it supports our traditional strengths, like the resources sector, as well as jobs in our emerging sectors like manufacturing. “We are doing this because we know that our manufacturers, and their workers’ jobs, rely on gas for energy and feedstock.” Global institutions, banks,  investors and a cross-sector collection of groups representing much of Australian society have called for economic recovery policies after Covid-19 to be designed to address the climate crisis. At the same time, the global gas market has been badly affected by the pandemic. The Lock the Gate Alliance Queensland spokeswoman, Ellie Smith, said public money should not be used to prop up financially unviable unconventional gas projects. “Around the world, unconventional gas projects are bleeding money because they do not stack up financially on their own,” Smith said. “More than $22bn has been wiped off the Australian LNG industry alone since the global oil market crash, which ravaged the sector even before Covid-19 was impacting global markets. “It’s clear the only way these unconventional gas companies can make money is if they stick out their hands for huge public subsidies. “Governments should not be subsidising an economically unstable, polluting industry, let alone one that leads to the destruction of farmland and the draining of precious underground water supplies.” The notion of a gas-led recovery has been championed by the gas sector, state and federal politicians."

Arrogant elitist hypocrisy is a byword for the Green-left. The modern-day nomenklatura take it as their right to flit about the globe, from their collections of mansions to luxury resorts, in Business Class and private jets, while sternly lecturing the rest of us to make do with less. Indeed, surveys show that the most ostentatiously “green” zealots have the most gargantuan environmental footprints.



Which shouldn’t be a surprise: they’re just following in the gilded footsteps of their Dear Leader.



 **George Soros** made big investment bets on fossil fuel companies in the fourth quarter of 2017 even though he claims these firms contribute to climate change, according to a Daily Caller News Foundation investigation.



In the last quarter of 2017, Soros Fund Management reported investments in eleven new fossil corporations totaling nearly $160 million, according to his company’s December 31, 2017, filing before the Securities and Exchange Commission reviewed by The DCNF.



Guess he’s got to destroy the planet in order to save it. It’s not as if he’s a greedy liar, surely?



His investments in fossil fuels undermine his public pledge to use his money to eliminate the oil, gas and coal industries, claiming they threaten the planet by accelerating climate change.



The billionaire’s most recent political efforts to warn about climate change was his underwriting of the organizations behind the April 29, 2017, “People’s Climate March” that marked the 100th day of President **Donald Trump** ’s administration. Soros donated $36 million to 18 of the march’s 55 steering committee organizations between 2000 to 2014, according to the Media Research Center.



He also agreed to give former Vice President **Al Gore** ’s Alliance for Climate Protection $10 million over a three-year period.



Further, Soros founded and operates his own climate change advocacy group called the Climate Policy Initiative. He pledged to give at least $100 million in 2009 to the institute over ten years and in 2015 he gave $26.5 million to the group, according to his latest filing with the Internal Revenue Service.



So, Soros gives $70 million to climate groups. At the same time, he invests $180 million in planet-killing fossil fuels. **George Soros is putting his money where his mouth isn’t.**



 **He’s also pouring tens of millions into some of the Green-left’s biggest bogey-men.**



His company’s second-biggest energy investment was **Halliburton** […]



Soros not only invested in oil and natural gas companies, but also into coal. Soros tried to position himself as an enemy of coal, stating at the 2009 Copenhagen climate change summit, “There is no magic bullet for climate change, but there is a lethal bullet: coal.”



In the last quarter, however, he invested $4.7 million into **Peabody Energy Corporation** , the largest “pure play coal company” in the United States, according to the company’s website. Peabody sold 188 million tons of coal to electric utilities in 2016. The company operates 23 surface and underground mines in the United States and in Australia[…]in June 2016 the billionaire invested $54 million in **Columbia Pipeline** […]



 **His firm currently invests in cars and airlines** , including holding stock in General Motors, Fiat-Chrysler, and Allison Transmission, which makes transmissions for heavy-duty trucks. He has supported airlines for many years and currently owns stock in Southwest Airlines and Spirit Airlines.



 **He also ploughs substantial money into Monsanto, and AmerisourceBergen, a company convicted for supplying contaminated syringes to cancer patients. What a guy!**



So, why the disconnect between Soros’s public virtue-signalling and his private money-making?



“These global elitists try to wrap themselves in this ‘sky-is-falling, fossil fuels are bad, climate change is real mantra,’ but the fact of the matter is they are doing that to manipulate markets,” [ **Craig Richardson** , president of the free market Energy and Environment Legal Institute] said.



Just like the nomenklatura of old, the globalist elite spout all the right-on slogans, but it’s really all about just keeping the rubes quiet while they wallow in their privilege. They’re the pigs who are more equal than the rest of us animals.

"The Carbon Sense Coalition has forwarded a submission to the Australian Senate Standing Committee on Economics in response to the Exposure Draft of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill 2009. The introduction states:
“This enquiry is focussed on The Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill 2009. The name itself is a deliberate deception – the only truthful word is “Scheme” which the Oxford Pocket Dictionary defines as “artful or underhand design”. It is not about carbon or about pollution – it is “The Carbon Dioxide Cap, Trade and Tax Scheme Bill” (referred to hereafter as “The Cap-n-Tax Scheme” or “The Scheme” for short).
“There is substantial doubt on the science on which this Scheme is justified. The chief justification is scare forecasts based on complex computerised climate models that few people believe and even fewer people understand.”

"**US President Donald Trump has signed into law a bill that supports pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.**
The Human Rights and Democracy Act mandates an annual review, to check if Hong Kong has enough autonomy to justify its special status with the US.
Mr Trump said he signed the law ""out of respect for President Xi [Jinping], China, and the people of Hong Kong"".
China's foreign ministry threatened ""counter measures"" if the US continued ""going down the wrong path"".
Mr Trump is currently seeking a deal with China, in order to end a trade war between the two countries.
""The US has been disregarding facts and distorting truth,"" a Chinese foreign ministry statement said.
""It openly backed violent criminals who rampantly smashed facilities, set fire, assaulted innocent civilians, trampled on the rule of law, and jeopardized social order.""
The foreign ministry summoned the US ambassador to demand that Washington stops interfering in Chinese internal affairs.
Hong Kong's government also reacted, saying the American bill would send the wrong signal and would not help to ease the situation.
But a key activist in the Hong Kong protest movement, Joshua Wong, said the US law was a ""remarkable achievement"" for ""all Hongkongers"".
Mr Trump had previously been non-committal about whether he would sign the bill, saying he was ""with"" Hong Kong but also that Mr Xi was ""an incredible guy"".
However, the bill had widespread congressional support, which meant that even if he vetoed it, lawmakers could potentially have voted to overturn his decision.
The president also signed a second bill, which bans the export of crowd-control munitions to the police in Hong Kong - including tear gas, rubber bullets and stun guns.
""[The bills] are being enacted in the hope that leaders and representatives of China and Hong Kong will be able to amicably settle their differences, leading to long-term peace and prosperity for all,"" Mr Trump said.
The bill was introduced in June in the early stages of the protests in Hong Kong, and was overwhelmingly approved by the House of Representatives last month.
It says: ""Hong Kong is part of China but has a largely separate legal and economic system.
""The [annual review] shall assess whether China has eroded Hong Kong's civil liberties and rule of law as protected by Hong Kong's Basic Law.""
Among other things, Hong Kong's special trading status means it is not affected by US sanctions or tariffs placed on the mainland.
The bill also says the US should allow Hong Kong residents to obtain US visas, even if they have been arrested for being part of non-violent protests.
Hong Kong's protests started in June against a proposed law to allow extradition to mainland China but it has since transformed into a larger pro-democracy movement.
The protests have also seen increasingly violent clashes, with police being attacked, and officers firing live bullets.
Protesters have thrown petrol bombs and attacked businesses seen as being pro-Beijing.
The protesters, meanwhile, have accused police of brutality.
On Sunday, Hong Kong held local council elections that were seen as a barometer of public opinion towards the government and the protesters.
The elections saw a landslide victory for the pro-democracy movement, with 17 of the 18 councils now controlled by pro-democracy councillors.
On Thursday, authorities moved into the Polytechnic University days after it had been the site of a fierce standoff between student activists and riot police.
The police searched the campus for dangerous items, to gather evidence and to see whether any students were still left on the site."
"WASHINGTON  —   President Trump on Wednesday began a sweeping crackdown on illegal immigration, ordering the immediate construction of a border wall with Mexico and aggressive efforts to find and deport unauthorized immigrants. He planned additional actions to cut back on legal immigration, including barring Syrian refugees from entering the United States. At the headquarters of the Department of Homeland Security, Mr. Trump signed a pair of executive orders that paved the way for a border wall and called for a newly expanded force to sweep up immigrants who are in the country illegally. He revived programs that allow the federal government to work with local and state law enforcement agencies to arrest and detain unauthorized immigrants with criminal records and to share information to help track and deport them. He also planned to clamp down on legal immigration in another action expected as early as Thursday. An   draft of that executive order, obtained by The New York Times, would indefinitely block Syrian refugees from entering the United States and bar all refugees from the rest of the world for at least 120 days. When the refugee program resumes, it would be much smaller, with the total number of refugees resettled in the United States this year more than halved, to 50, 000 from 110, 000. It would also suspend any immigration for at least 30 days from a number of predominantly Muslim countries  —   Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen  —   while the government toughened its already stringent screening procedures to weed out potential terrorists. White House officials declined to comment on the coming plan, but in a   interview that aired Wednesday on ABC, Mr. Trump acknowledged that it aimed to erect formidable barriers for those seeking refuge in the United States. “It’s going to be very hard to come in,” Mr. Trump said. “Right now, it’s very easy to come in. ” He also said his administration would “absolutely do safe zones in Syria” to discourage refugees from seeking safety in other countries, and chided Europe and Germany in particular for accepting millions of immigrants. “It’s a disaster, what’s happening there,” Mr. Trump said. Taken together, the moves would turn the full weight of the federal government to fortifying the United States border, rounding up some of the 11 million people who are in the country illegally and targeting refugees, who are often among the world’s most vulnerable people. It is an aggressive use of presidential power that follows through on the nationalistic vision Mr. Trump presented during his presidential campaign. “A nation without borders is not a nation,” Mr. Trump said Wednesday at the Department of Homeland Security, where he signed the orders alongside the newly   secretary, John F. Kelly. “Beginning today, the United States of America gets back control of its borders. ” The plans are a sharp break with former President Barack Obama’s approach and what was once a bipartisan consensus to devise a path to citizenship for some of the nation’s illegal immigrants. Mr. Obama, however, angered many immigrant groups by deporting millions of unauthorized workers, largely during his first term. But Mr. Trump, whose campaign rallies were filled with chants from his supporters of “build the wall,” has vowed to go much further. He has often described unauthorized immigrants as criminals who must be found and forcibly removed from the United States, as he did again on Wednesday. “We are going to get the bad ones out  —   the criminals and the drug dealers and gangs and gang members,” Mr. Trump said. “The day is over when they can stay in our country and wreak havoc. We are going to get them out, and we are going to get them out fast. ” The president had invited the families of people killed by unauthorized immigrants to watch him sign the orders alongside Homeland Security employees, and he asked each of them to stand in turn, telling of the deaths of their relatives, which he said had inspired his policies. “We hear you, we see you, and you will never, ever be ignored again,” Mr. Trump said, contending that they had been “victimized by open borders. ” The immigration orders drew furious condemnation from civil rights and religious groups as well as immigrant advocacy organizations. The groups described them as meanspirited, counterproductive and costly and said the new policies would raise constitutional concerns while undermining the American tradition of welcoming people from around the world. “They’re setting out to unleash this deportation force on steroids, and local police will be able to run wild, so we’re tremendously concerned about the impact that could have on immigrants and families across the country,” said Joanne Lin, senior legislative counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union. “After today’s announcement, the fear quotient is going to go up exponentially. ” Lynn Tramonte, the deputy director of America’s Voice Education Fund, an immigration advocacy group, said Mr. Trump was “wasting no time taking a wrecking ball to the Statue of Liberty. ” She called the orders “a dramatic, radical and extreme assault on immigrants and the values of our country. ” The orders also rankled officials in countries around the world. President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico, who had planned to travel to Washington next week to meet with Mr. Trump, let it be known that he was considering canceling his trip, senior Mexican officials said. Mr. Trump has claimed that Mexico will ultimately pay for the wall, but officials there have repeatedly said they have no intention of doing so. Conservative organizations in the United States and some Republican lawmakers praised Mr. Trump’s moves, saying they would usher in overdue enforcement of crucial homeland security laws that Mr. Obama had refused to carry out. “This looks like a return to enforcing the immigration laws, which is something that President Obama strayed from and has not been prioritized in a very long time,” said Tommy Binion, the director of policy outreach at the   Heritage Foundation. “To have President Trump focus on the problems immigration is bringing us as a nation is a relief. Finally, we have a government that recognizes the tragedies that we’re facing. ” Mr. Trump will not be able to accomplish the goals laid out in the immigration orders by himself. Congress would have to appropriate new funding for the construction of a wall, which some have estimated could cost tens of billions of dollars. Nonetheless, Mr. Trump directed federal agencies to use existing funds as a start to the wall and formally called for the hiring of an additional 5, 000 Border Patrol agents and 10, 000 immigration officers. The order would threaten the nation’s roughly three dozen sanctuary cities  —   jurisdictions that limit their cooperation with federal authorities seeking to detain unauthorized immigrants  —   with losing federal grant money if they do not comply with such requests. At the same time, Mr. Trump is reviving a program called Secure Communities, ended by the Obama administration, in which federal officials use digital fingerprints shared by local law enforcement departments to find and deport immigrants who commit crimes. The provisions are chilling to many immigration advocates, who argued that they could sweep up unauthorized immigrants beyond the criminals Mr. Trump says he wants to target. Among those listed as priorities for removal are those who have “engaged in fraud or willful misrepresentation in connection with any official matter or application before a governmental agency,” which would essentially include any undocumented worker who has signed an employment agreement in the United States. The order also includes a section that directs federal agencies to adjust their privacy policies to exclude unauthorized immigrants, in effect allowing the sharing of their personal identifying information, which could be used to track and apprehend them. “With today’s sweeping and constitutionally suspect executive actions, the president is turning his back on both our history and our values as a proud nation of immigrants,” said Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader. “Wasting billions of taxpayer dollars on a border wall Mexico will never pay for, and punishing cities that do not want their local police forces forced to serve as President Trump’s deportation dragnet, does nothing to fix our immigration system or keep Americans safe. ” The order on refugees is in line with a Muslim ban that Mr. Trump proposed during the campaign, though it does not single out any particular religion. It orders the secretary of state and the secretary of Homeland Security to prioritize those who are persecuted members of religious minorities, essentially ensuring that Christians living in predominantly Muslim countries would be at the top of the list. “In order to protect Americans,” the order states, “we must ensure that those admitted to this country do not bear hostile attitudes toward our country and its founding principles. ” It says that for the time being, admitting anyone from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen is “detrimental to the interests of the United States. ”"
"More than 80 years after the Hindenburg disaster, commercial airships could soon take to the skies again – carrying freight from Africa and as luxury transport for the super-rich on trips to the Arctic. A small Bedford-based company has emerged as the front-runner in a race to bring environment-friendly versions of the zeppelin-type aircraft back to the skies. Hybrid Air Vehicles (HAV), which has in the past attracted funding from Peter Hambro, a founder of Russian gold miner Petropavlovsk, and Iron Maiden frontman Bruce Dickinson, has raised £1.6m – £630,000 more than it sought – in its latest crowdfunding campaign.  Tom Grundy, the company’s chief executive, said the Covid pandemic and the flygskam movement against air travel, could drive huge demand for the low-emissions craft. “The pandemic has changed almost every aspect of our lives,” he said. “But one thing is for sure – it has given us all a glimpse of a cleaner future. In just weeks carbon levels dropped significantly, partly driven by a massive reduction in air travel, but it’s a temporary change and only a fraction of what we must achieve to keep global warming within target levels.” Grundy claims that if all goes to plan, HAV’s airships will be by 2025 able to transport people faster and with lower emissions than road, rail or sea. The company estimates that its Airlander 10 craft will fly with up to 90% fewer emissions than traditional aircraft. A second-generation of the company’s airship, due before 2030, will be electric-powered and emissions-free, the company hopes. The company says it has letters of intent for 15 commercial aircraft, and is “working to secure major defence contracts supporting both the UK and the US”. The craft was originally designed as a surveillance vehicle for intelligence missions in Afghanistan. HAV claims independent estimates put the value of the airship market at $50bn over the next 20 years. It aims to sell 265 of its Airlander craft over that period. “HAV is the only company in the world to have flown a full-scale prototype hybrid aircraft,” it says in its fundraising prospectus. “Over the past 10-plus years, we’ve spent £116m developing Airlander. We’re now production-ready, with a clear path to certification.” The £25m Airlander 10 prototype undertook six test flights, some of which ended badly. It crashed in 2016 on its second test flight, after a successful 30-minute maiden trip. HAV tweeted at the time: “Airlander sustained damage on landing during today’s flight. No damage was sustained mid-air or as a result of a telegraph pole as reported.” The aircraft, which can take off and land from almost any flat surface, reached heights of 7,000ft and speeds of up to 50 knots during its final tests. The company has had UK government backing and grants from the European Union. Other international firms are also developing airships. French company Flying Whales last month teamed up with the Nouvelle-Aquitaine regional government in south-west France to start building 154-metre airships near Bordeaux for cargo transport. In the US, Skunk Works, the innovation arm of defence giant Lockheed Martin, is designing airships to carry medical supplies to remote locations. “Burning less than a tenth the fuel of a helicopter per tonne, the Hybrid Airship will redefine sustainability,” Lockheed Martin says. “With unlimited access to isolated locations around the globe, hybrid airships safely and sustainably support a wide range of activities in areas with little to no infrastructure. The airship offers the simplicity of a pickup truck by carrying cargo loads and personnel in and out of remote areas daily.” HAV says its aircraft could be used to transport up to 90 people or 10 tonnes of cargo, and could fly for days at a time. It intends to tap the luxury travel market, offering the atmosphere of a five-star hotel in the skies. It has teamed up with Swedish firm OceanSky Cruises to promote future “experiential travel” over the North Pole with Arctic explorer Robert Swan. “The expedition will show that travel and transport by air can be sustainable. Lighter-than-air technology can supply humanity with ultra-efficient means of mobility, and operate in areas without infrastructure and civilisation,” the company says in its adverts. OceanSky said it would offer 10 luxury en suite bedrooms, “horizon-to-horizon views from the aircraft’s Infinity Lounge” and an “Altitude Bar” serving drinks with “the ultimate view”."

Guest essay by Eric Worrall
Australia has been repeated accused over the last few weeks, of successfully lobbying UNESCO to drop mention of the Great Barrier Reef from a climate report. My question – if a relatively minor world player like Australia can manipulate the content of a UNESCO climate report, what does this say about the scientific integrity of other UN bureaucracies, such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change?
Every reference to Australia was scrubbed from the final version of a major UN report on climate change after the Australian government intervened, objecting that the information could harm tourism.
Guardian Australia can reveal the report “World Heritage and Tourism in a Changing Climate”, which Unesco jointly published with the United Nations environment program and the Union of Concerned Scientists on Friday, initially had a key chapter on the Great Barrier Reef, as well as small sections on Kakadu and the Tasmanian forests.
But when the Australian Department of Environment saw a draft of the report, it objected, and every mention of Australia was removed by Unesco. Will Steffen, one of the scientific reviewers of the axed section on the reef, said Australia’s move was reminiscent of “the old Soviet Union”.
No sections about any other country were removed from the report. The removals left Australia as the only inhabited continent on the planet with no mentions.

The Guardian provides a link to a chapter which they claim was removed from the final report, thanks to Australia’s political manoeuvring;
Climate change is the primary long-term threat to the integrity and biodiversity of the world’s most extensive coral reef ecosystem. The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) was added to the world heritage list in 1981. It is one of the world’s most complex and diverse ecosystems, with at least 400 species of hard coral, 150 species of soft corals and sea fans, and more than 2,900 individual reefs and some of the most important seagrass meadows in the world – teeming with marine life of all sorts, including more than 1,600 fish species, seabirds, seahorses, whales, dolphins, crocodiles, dugongs and endangered green turtles. The GBR extends for 2,300km along the coast of Queensland in Northeast Australia and has evolved over a period of 15,000 years (Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority 2012, Unesco). The GBR region is important for the indigenous heritage of First Australians – Aboriginal and Torres Straits Islander people – who are the traditional wners. Climate change threatens hunting and fishing as well as other traditional and cultural practices. Some sacred sites are also at risk for the more than 70 traditional owner groups for whom natural resources are inseparable from cultural identity (Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority 2012).

Click here to see the official report. I haven’t read the full report, but just glancing through provided some interesting highlights. The Union of Concerned Scientists features in the list of credits. The Great Barrier Reef gets a mention on page 89, in the references, but as far as I can tell it is not mentioned elsewhere, which in my opinion supports the assertion of a hasty removal of censored material from the report.
The following is a statement by the Australian Environment Department, about their contact with UNESCO regarding this report;
The World Heritage Centre initiated contact with the Department of the Environment in early 2016 for our views on aspects of this report.
The department expressed concern that giving the report the title ‘Destinations at risk’ had the potential to cause considerable confusion. In particular, the world heritage committee had only six months earlier decided not to include the Great Barrier Reef on the in-danger list and commended Australia for the Reef 2050 Plan.
The department was concerned that the framing of the report confused two issues – the world heritage status of the sites and risks arising from climate change and tourism. It is the world heritage committee, not its secretariat (the World Heritage Centre), which is properly charged with examining the status of world heritage sites.
Recent experience in Australia had shown that negative commentary about the status of world heritage properties impacted on tourism.
The department indicated it did not support any of Australia’s world heritage properties being included in such a publication for the reasons outlined above.
The Department of the Environment conveyed these concerns through Australia’s ambassador to UNESCO.
The department did not brief the minister on this issue.

Regardless of whether you agree with the contents of the report, to me the far more damaging revelation is how easy it is for governments to manipulate UN climate processes – how susceptible the content of allegedly scientific UN Climate reports is to “political” input.

"Despite flying being the single fastest way to grow our individual carbon footprint, people still want to fly. Passenger numbers even grew by 3.3% globally last year alone. The hype around “Flygskam” – a global movement championed by climate activist Greta Thunberg that encourages people to stop travelling by plane – seems to have attracted more media attention than actual followers.  A 2019 survey found that although people in the UK were increasingly concerned about aviation emissions – they were also more reluctant to fly less. This might reflect how flying has become normalised in society, aided by ticket prices which are on average 61% cheaper in real terms than in 1998.  I’m increasingly asked by peers about how they can fly “sustainably”, the “greenest” airlines, or the “best” carbon offsets to buy. People want to avoid flight shame, without avoiding flights. The industry has reacted quickly. Websites like Skyscanner, used to compare flight options between destinations, now show customers a “greener choice” – displaying how much less C02 a certain flight emits, compared to the average for that route. These green choices are determined to be flights that use more direct routes, airlines that have newer aircraft, or can carry more passengers. While there are cases where two airlines operating the same route can produce very different emissions, on short-haul routes, emissions differences are invariably small – usually less than 10%. The greenest option would be to travel by train, which has as much as 90% fewer emissions than equivalent flights. However, Skyscanner stopped showing passengers train options in 2019. Meanwhile, popular budget airline Ryanair – whose CEO only recently admitted climate change isn’t a hoax – now claims to have the greenest fleet of air planes in Europe. The company’s modern, fuel efficient planes – alongside its ability to fill them with passengers – does make it the “greenest” air travel option out there. However, Ryanair had a total of 450 planes in operation in 2019 (compared to only 250 in 2010) – meaning that despite its fuel-efficient planes, the sheer quantity of fuel they burn is why they were named one of Europe’s top ten polluting companies in 2019.  Last year also saw carbon offset schemes become popular. These schemes allow passengers to pay extra so their airline can invest in environmental projects on their behalf – thereby making a flight theoretically “carbon-neutral”. British Airways now offsets all of its customers’ domestic UK flights, while Ryanair also has a scheme allowing passengers to buy offsets for their flights, with proceeds going to projects including a whale protection scheme – which appears completely unconnected to reducing carbon at all. Easyjet has also started buying offsets on behalf of all its passengers – costing a total of £25 million a year. This has apparently been a successful PR move, with internal research finding that passengers who were aware of the offsetting policy were more satisfied with their flight than customers who didn’t know.  Passengers might feel satisfied, but whether their offsets actually reduce carbon is less clear. Critics question the time-lag associated with offsets, especially tree-planting schemes. A plane that flies today pollutes today – but a tree planted today won’t remove carbon for years. As for “avoided deforestation” projects, which aim to protect existing trees, proving these trees wouldn’t have survived without offset funding is almost impossible. 


      Read more:
      Exaggerating how much CO₂ can be absorbed by tree planting risks deterring crucial climate action


 Airlines often claim that their offsets save high levels of carbon, at a conveniently low price. For example, Easyjet only invests £3 per tonne of carbon it emits in a carbon offset scheme. But such a low-ball investment might not even be able to give these carbon offset schemes the finances needed to actually offset the effects of one tonne of carbon. For context, the EU Emissions Trading Scheme currently trades carbon at £21 a tonne, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change thinks carbon should be traded at a minimum of £105 a tonne. Newer, and more expensive offset models – which extract carbon directly from the air look promising – but are hard to scale up.  The other danger of these cheap offsets is that travellers might believe they solve the problems caused by flying – so they won’t change their travel behaviour. Indeed, one government minister even argues that there’s no need for people to fly less, because low-carbon and electric flights are around the corner. Despite reports that solar or battery-powered planes are coming to the rescue, current plane technology is going nowhere fast.  This is partly because jet fuel on international flights isn’t taxed, which leaves little financial incentive for the industry to invest in big technological shifts. Aircraft manufacturers Boeing even predicts it will produce 44,000 planes by 2038 to accommodate the 8 billion passengers flying each year by then. Those planes will look, sound and pollute much like today’s ones.  Aviation is currently forecast to account for almost a quarter of global emissions, and be the UK’s most polluting sector in 2050. And if the government’s recent bail-out of failing airline Flybe is anything to go by, aviation will continue to be let off the hook.  Carbon offsets and “greener” tweaks might only help to further rationalise the status quo, and prevent tougher policies from coming into play – such as taxing frequent flyers, or stopping airport expansions. But as climate-related natural disasters become more common, radically changing our attitude to flying will soon be unavoidable."
"India must swiftly and permanently turn away from coal despite its need for cheap energy, the UN secretary general has urged, aiming to revive global action on the climate crisis as the world begins to emerge from the coronavirus pandemic. António Guterres told a virtual audience on Friday morning that coal use must be phased out in India, with no new coal-fired power stations after this year, and that fossil fuel subsidies must be ended.  “[Coal] spells stranded assets and makes no commercial sense – the coal business is going up in smoke,” he said. “India can become a true global superpower in the fight against climate change if it speeds up its shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy,” he said. Narendra Modi’s government has been reluctant to make new commitments on the climate crisis, often taking a combative stance by suggesting that rich nations should shoulder responsibility for emissions while developing countries continue to develop using fossil fuels. The government has continued to promote new coal-fired power generation even as the price of renewable energy has tumbled. Guterres rejected that stance, warning that Indians themselves would suffer from a continued reliance on coal, in the grim air pollution that blights many of their cities. “Investing in fossil fuels means more deaths and illness and rising healthcare costs,” he said. “It is, simply put, a human disaster and bad economics.” Wind and solar electricity costs have fallen so much that building new renewable generation is now cheaper than operating 39% of the world’s existing coal capacity, and this will increase to 60% of existing capacity in the next two years, according to the UN. Half of India’s current coal capacity will be uncompetitive against renewables in 2022. “That is why the world’s largest investors are increasingly abandoning coal – they see the writing on the wall,” said Guterres in the 19th Darbari Seth memorial lecture, held in honour of the founder of the Energy and Resource Institute, a renowned Indian centre of research. It was the UN chief’s second major intervention in recent weeks aimed at a key emerging economy. Last month he addressed a similar call to the Chinese government, calling for an end to investment in new coal-fired power plants. “There is no such thing as clean coal, and coal should have no place in any rational recovery plan,” he said in a lecture at Tsinghua University on 23 July. “It is deeply concerning that new coal power plants are still being planned and financed, even though renewables offer three times more jobs and are now cheaper than coal in most countries.” Guterres wants to revive momentum on climate breakdown that was lost as the Covid-19 pandemic hit. Some nations have reacted to the coronavirus crisis by offering help to stricken industries including fossil fuels and high-emitting sectors such as aviation and car-making, without attaching “green strings” or conditions that would require them to cut emissions. Governments including China and India have revived plans for new coal-fired power generation as a way to stimulate the economy and create jobs. Energy and climate experts are worried this will lock in high-emissions infrastructure for decades to come and destroy any hope of staving off climate breakdown. The chief of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birol, warned recently that the world had six months to change direction. Guterres has also urged rich countries to forsake fossil fuels and forge a “green recovery” as they seek to stimulate their economies amid the Covid-19 recession. Navroz Dubash, a professor at the Centre for Policy Research in Delhi, said Guterres was right to highlight the worsening economics of coal and benefits of clean energy, but warned that ending coal use in India would be “complex” as the new renewable energy jobs would not be in the same places as existing coal jobs. “Instead of more targets and pledges, India needs to actively plan to hasten and smoothen the path from coal to renewable energy. This means planning for new livelihood opportunities in coalmining areas to ensure a just transition, ensuring the robustness of the grid, and making sure the costs of transition are not borne by poor consumers,” he told the Guardian. “The secretary general could usefully also call out other countries, including far wealthier countries, who are dragging their feet on a renewable energy future.” Yannick Glemarec, the executive director of the Green Climate Fund, said: “It is difficult to phase out fossil fuel subsidies, but the low oil price gives an opportunity to phase them out and recycle the subsidies to help soften the impact.” China and India will be key players at the UN Cop26 summit next year, when all nations are expected to come up with fresh commitments to curb greenhouse gas emissions in line with the Paris agreement goal of holding temperature rises to no more than 2C, which scientists regard as the limit of safety. Postponed from this year, the Cop26 summit will be hosted by the UK in Glasgow next November, and is seen as a crunch conference to get the Paris agreement back on track. Current commitments under the accord would lead to 3C of global heating, which scientists say would spell disaster."
"By Alan Caruba
Every so often The New York Times slips up and lets some truth appear on its hallowed and vastly over-rated pages.
Such was the case on May 2nd when reporter John M. Broder wrote “Seeking to Save the Planet, With a Thesaurus.”  As he put it in the first sentence, “The problem with global warming, some environmentalists believe, is ‘global warming.’” This is a very real problem, especially when the word is getting out that the planet has been cooling for a decade.
The problem worsens for them as word leaks that the ice at the North Pole is a lot thicker than earlier suspected—something that does not happen if it’s supposed to be melting. And the same holds for the South Pole whose ice is growing, along with many of the world’s glaciers.

Having spent the past twenty years or so blaming “global warming” for everything happening on Earth, the public has grown tired of the endless blather about it. Since it has provided much of the funding that Green organizations have pulled in from the gullible, not to mention from millions in government grants to study something that is not happening, the time has come to “re-brand” global warming into something that will still generate the money these charlatans depend upon.
Broder had laid hands on a memorandum by ecoAmerica, “a nonprofit environmental marketing and messaging firm in Washington.” To rephrase that, ecoAmerica is no different from any Madison Avenue advertising or public relations firm whose job is to get you to buy or believe something.
When you have a lemon, make lemonade, and global warming is rapidly becoming a lemon. So the folks at ecoAmerica advise the Greens to avoid grim warnings about global warming and talk about “our deteriorating atmosphere.”
This has been tried. Remember the Ozone Layer that was supposed to be disappearing? It didn’t. It hasn’t. It won’t. Meanwhile you and everyone else has lost access to Freon, the miracle chemical that was vital to refrigeration as well as one of the best fire extinguishers ever invented. Those holes? They tended to show up over active volcanoes!
The atmosphere is not deteriorating. It hasn’t deteriorated for more than 4.5 billion years, permitting Earth to be the only planet in our solar system capable of sustaining life.
EcoAmerica went on to recommend moving away from discussing carbon dioxide (CO2) in favor of telling lies about “the dirty fuels of the past.” Well, those “dirty fuels” are not in the past. They are responsible for all of the energy we use every day and, unless you don’t like electricity and don’t want to drive or fuel anything, you better learn to like oil, natural gas, and coal.
Nuclear energy is nice too, but the Obama administration has just made it impossible to store nuclear waste in the multi-million dollar facility at Yukka Mountain in Nevada. Why? There is no good answer except to note this is the most anti-energy administration since the days of Jimmy Carter.
EcoAmerica doesn’t want to “confuse” the public about “cap and trade” legislation that would run up the cost of energy for everyone by thousands of dollars a year. Instead, they recommend that Greens talk about “cap and cash back” or “pollution reduction refund.”
Having apparently concluded that the Greens have been lying to them for years, all the polls and surveys reveal that “Environmental issues consistently rate near the bottom of public worry, according to many public opinion polls.
Indeed, ecoAmerica suggests that Greens stop using the word “environment” and begin talking about “the air we breathe, the water our children drink.”
The problem with that is that the air in America is as clean as humanly possible to achieve and the water is the safest on Earth to drink.
The truth means nothing to the Greens. Their game is all about power over everyone’s lives and the means to drain every dollar they can from the government and from gullible people who buy products whose prices have been jacked up by claiming it is environmentally friendly in some fashion.
They have spent several decades indoctrinating and frightening the newest generations of Americans in the nation’s schools and via the print and broadcast media.
These people are utterly contemptible.

A Robust Sun-Climate Connection 
Increasingly Affirmed By Scientists

“The emerging causal effects from SS [solar activity] to GT [global temperatures], especially for recent decades, are overwhelmingly proved” 
                                                          — Huang et al., 2017

(1)  Yndestad and Solheim, 2017
“Periods with few sunspots are associated with low solar activity and cold climate periods. Periods with many sunspots are associated with high solar activity and warm climate periods. … Studies that employ cosmogenic isotope data and sunspot data indicate that we are currently leaving a grand activity maximum, which began in approximately 1940 and is now declining (Usoskin et al., 2003; Solanki et al., 2004; Abreu et al., 2008). Because grand maxima  and minima occur on centennial or millennial timescales, they can only be investigated using proxy data, i.e., solar activity reconstructed from 10Be and 14C time-calibrated data. The conclusion is that the activity level of the Modern Maximum (1940–2000) is a relatively rare event, with the previous similarly high levels of solar activity observed 4 and 8 millennia ago (Usoskin et al., 2003). Nineteen grand maxima have been identified by Usoskin et al. (2007) in an 11,000-yr series.”
Below, the trends in Total Solar Irradiance for 1700-2013, which comes from the Yndestad and Solheim (2017) paper cited above, are shown to closely correspond to the temperature trends for the Northern Hemisphere (NH, derived from “the mean of 22 regional reconstructions of instrumental JJA [June-August] temperatures“) as shown in Stoffel et al., 2015.

“[T]he recent summer-time warming in Scotland is likely not unique when compared to multi-decadal warm periods observed in the 1300s, 1500s, and 1730s … All six [Northern Hemisphere] records show a warmer interval in the period leading up to the 1950s, although it is less distinct in the CEU reconstruction. [E]xtreme cold (and warm) years observed in NCAIRN appear more related to internal forcing of the summer North Atlantic Oscillation. … There is reasonable agreement in general between the records regarding protracted cold periods which occur during the LIA and specifically around the Maunder solar minimum centred on the second half of the seventeenth century and to some extent also around the latter part of the fifteenth century coinciding with part of the Spörer minimum (Usoskin et al. 2007).”

“Various scientific studies have investigated the causal link between solar activity (SS) and the earth’s temperature (GT). [T]he corresponding CCM [Convergent Cross Mapping] results indicate increasing significance of causal effect from SS [solar activity] to GT [global temperature] since 1880 to recent years, which provide solid evidences that may contribute on explaining the escalating global tendency of warming up recent decades. … The connection between solar activity and global warming has been well established in the scientific literature. For example, see references [1–10]. … Among which, the SSA [Singular Spectrum Analysis] trend extraction is identified as the most reliable method for data preprocessing, while CCM [Convergent Cross Mapping] shows outstanding performance among all causality tests adopted. The emerging causal effects from SS [solar activity] to GT [global temperatures], especially for recent decades, are overwhelmingly proved, which reflects the better understanding of the tendency of global warming.”

“Reconstructed long-term temperature variations match reasonably well with solar irradiance changes since warm and cold phases correspond with high and low solar activity, respectively. … The main driver of the large-scale character of the warm and cold episodes may be changes in the solar activity. The beginning of the reconstruction starts with the end of the Spörer minimum. The Maunder minimum, from 1645 to 1715 (Luterbacher et al., 2001) seems to be consistent with a cold period from 1645 to 1706. In addition, the Dalton minimum from 1796 to 1830 is detected for the period 1810 to 1838. However, a considerably cold period from 1778 to 1798 is not in agreement with a decrease in the solar activity. Four warm periods – 1626–1637, 1800–1809, 1845– 1859, and 1986–2012 – have been identified to correspond to increased solar activity.”

“The SST variation shows a millennial period of ~ 1500-yr and centennial periods of 131-yr and 113-yr. The ~ 1.5 kyr cycle dominated the period of 8.9–5.5 cal. kyr BP, suggesting a tele-connection between the Yellow Sea SST and global climate changes, might through the Kuroshio current. Centennial periods dominated almost all of cold periods recorded in core BY14, implying the signature of solar irradiance cycles by means of the strengthened East Asia Winter Monsoon (EAWM).”

“The results indicate that the climate of the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA, AD 900–1300) was similar to that of the Current Warm Period (CWP, AD 1850–present), which contradicts previous studies. … As for the Little Ice Age (LIA, AD 1550–1850), the results from this study, together with previous data from the Makassar Strait, indicate a cold and wet period compared with the CWP and the MCA in the western Pacific. The cold LIA period agrees with the timing of the Maunder sunspot minimum and is therefore associated with low solar activity.”

“The record represents the southernmost annually laminated (i.e., varved) archive from the Balkan Peninsula spanning the Little Ice Age, allowing insights into critical time intervals of climate instability such as during the Maunder and Dalton solar minima. … [W]et conditions in winter prevailed during 1740–1790 AD, whereas dry winters marked the periods 1790–1830 AD (Dalton Minimum) and 1830–1930 AD, the latter being sporadically interrupted by wet winters. … Representing one of the strongest global climate instabilities during the Holocene, the Little Ice Age (LIA) is marked by a multicentennial-long cooling (14the19th centuries AD) that preceded the recent ‘global warming’ of the 20th century. The cooling has been predominantly attributed to reduced solar activity and was particularly pronounced during the 1645-1715 AD and 1790-1830 AD solar minima, which are known as Maunder and Dalton Minima, respectively.”

“We suggest that solar activity may play a key role in driving the climatic fluctuations in NC [North China] during the last 22 centuries, with its quasi ∼100, 50, 23, or 22-year periodicity clearly identified in our climatic reconstructions. … It has been widely suggested from both climate modeling and observation data that solar activity plays a key role in driving late Holocene climatic fluctuations by triggering global temperature variability and atmospheric dynamical circulation (e.g., Haigh, 1996; Shindell et al., 1999; Bond et al., 2001; Fleitmann et al., 2003; Dykoski et al., 2005).  … The 100, 57 and 23 year periods for PANN [annual precipitation], as well as the 103, 50, and 22 year periods for TANN [annual temperature], correlate well with the 100, 50, 23 and 22 year cycles for the solar activity observed in various solar parameters (e.g., Wilson et al., 1996; Li et al., 1996; Chowdhury et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2014), therefore implying an in-phase relationship between the climatic oscillation in NC [North China] and solar activity.”

“The chironomid-based temperature reconstruction from Lake Atnsjøen in Eastern Norway with mean resolution of 30 years provided evidence that large-scale processes, such as the NAO fluctuations and solar activity modified local climate, and subsequently affected lakes functioning. The three minor cooling periods were reconstructed in the first half of the Millennium: 1050–1150, 1270–1370, 1440–1470 CE, that coincide with solar activity minima: Oort, Wulf, and Spörer respectively. Furthermore, a two peaked cooling period in the second half of the Millennium was identified that coincided with the LIA. These changes co-occurred with the prevailing negative NAO index.”
“The beginning of the 1270–1370 CE cooling coincide with Wulf solar activity minimum suggesting that the climate was responding to Sun activity. The climate cooling synchronous to this solar minimum had almost global range and it has been recorded from Europe, Arctic, North America and Antarctica (Osborn and Briffa, 2006; PAGES 2k Consortium, 2013) but again not in Greenland (Osborn and Briffa, 2006). … The beginning of the 1440–1470 CE cold period is synchronous to the pronounce negative NAO phase (Trouet et al., 2009). … Maunder solar minimum caused a very deep negative NAO index phase (Shindell et al., 2001), which consecutively lead to significant drop in the reconstructed temperature.”
“The temperature reconstruction from Lake Atnsjøen indicates that recent and ongoing climate warming began already in 1800 CE following the LIA. Temperatures increased very fast, from 8.5 to 12.8 °C during the first 75 years [1800-1875], but in the 20th century the increase became less pronounced. … The warming at the beginning of 19th century in the region of Lake Atnsjøen coincides with a reconstruction from Southern Finland (Luoto, 2013), and a record from Northern Sweden (Osborn and Briffa, 2006).  Its onset correlates with the positive NAO index and increased solar activity.”

“Late Holocene climate change in coastal East Asia was likely driven by ENSO variation.   Our tree pollen index of warmness (TPIW) shows important late Holocene cold events associated with low sunspot periods such as Oort, Wolf, Spörer, and Maunder Minimum. Comparisons among standard Z-scores of filtered TPIW, ΔTSI, and other paleoclimate records from central and northeastern China, off the coast of northern Japan, southern Philippines, and Peru all demonstrate significant relationships [between solar activity and climate]. This suggests that solar activity drove Holocene variations in both East Asian Monsoon (EAM) and El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). In particular, the latter seems to have predominantly controlled the coastal climate of East Asia to the extent that the influence of precession was nearly muted during the late Holocene.”


(11) Matveev et al., 2017
“An increase in atmospheric moisture for the warm period of the year (May–September) since 1890s, and mean annual temperatures since the 1950s was identified. During the same time period [1890s to 2014], there was a marked increase in amplitude of the annual variations for temperature and precipitation. … These [temperature and precipitation] fluctuations are consistent with 10–12-years Schwabe–Wolf, 22-years Hale, and the 32–36-years Bruckner Solar Cycles. There was an additional relationship found between high-frequency (short-period) climate fluctuations, lasting for about three years, and 70–90-years fluctuations of the moisture regime in the study region corresponding to longer cycles. … In the current work, sunspot data were used as a surrogate for solar activity and expressed as the Wolf Number (W). There are several solar cycles which were tested including the Schwabe–Wolf (11 years), Hale (22–24 years), Bruckner (33 years), and Gliessberg (70–90 years) cycles.  … This work revealed that there was a correlation between climatic variables and solar activity maxima and minima (W). The hydrothermal coefficient (HTC) has a phase relationship with W, and then both of these variables with the radial increment relative index maxima and minima in Pinus sylvestris L. (I) during the last 100–140 years.”

(12) Cosentino et al., 2017
“A review of the literature indicates that the climate was significantly less stable than previously supposed during the Holocene, since its warming trend was characterized by relevant short-term cooling events occurring at decennial and centennial scale (Dansgaard et al., 1993; Bond et al., 1999; Mayewski et al., 2004). The most recent cold phase was the Little Ice Age (LIA), which caused the expansion of glaciers in the alpine regions at lower latitudes. Several authors have linked this cooler climatic condition to a period of reduced solar activity (Mauquoy et al., 2002), which caused a decrease in summer insolation (Wanner et al., 2011). … [T]he cooling event known as Little Ice Age (LIA)… persisted more or less from the 13th to the 19th century (Perry and Hsu, 2000). … Furthermore, the fluctuations occurring in the frequency curve of H. balthica could be related to several brief cooling events which characterize the LIA, namely Wolf, Sporer, Maunder and Dalton [solar minimum periods] (Lamb, 1984; Mauquoy et al., 2002).”

(13) Schwander et al., 2017
“Influence of solar variability on the occurrence of Central European weather types from 1763 to 2009 … Weather types and reanalysis data show that the 11-year solar cycle influences the late winter atmospheric circulation over Central Europe with colder (warmer) conditions under low (high) solar activity. Model simulations used for a comparison do not reproduce the imprint of the 11-year solar cycle found in the reanalyses data.  … Atmospheric circulation over Europe is strongly correlated to the NAO and hence solar activity is thought to have an influence on weather conditions in Europe in winter.  Studies show a preference of cold winters in Europe to be associated with minima in the 11-year solar cycle (e.g., Lockwood et al., 2010; Sirocko et al., 2012). … The 247-year long analysis [1763-2009]  of the 11-year solar cycle impact on late winter European weather patterns suggest a reduction in the occurrence of westerly flow types linked to a reduced mean zonal flow under low solar activity. Following these observation, we estimate the probability to have cold conditions in winter over Europe to be higher under low solar activity than under high activity. Also similar [cold] conditions can occur during periods of prolonged reduced total solar irradiance. …  Solar activity can have effects on the atmospheric circulation through three different mechanisms. These effects may arise from direct changes in total solar irradiance (TSI), from changes in stratospheric ozone induced by changes in solar UV, or from changes in stratospheric ozone induced by energetic particles, whose flux is modulated by solar activity. The ~1 Wm-2 variation in TSI over an 11-yr sunspot cycle corresponds to a change in the radiation forcing of about ~0.17 Wm-2.”

“Western Mediterranean Holocene record of abrupt hydro-climatic changes … Imprints of North Atlantic meltwater discharges, NAO and solar forcing …Early Holocene winter rain minima are in phase with cooling events and millennial-scale meltwater discharges in the sub-polar North Atlantic. … [A] significant hydro-climatic shift at the end of the African Humid Period (∼5 ka) indicates a change in climate forcing mechanisms. The Late Holocene climate variability in the Middle Atlas features a multi-centennial-scale NAO-type pattern, with Atlantic cooling and Western Mediterranean winter rain maxima generally associated with solar minima.”

(15) Sun et al., 2017
“[A]t least six centennial droughts occurred at about 7300, 6300, 5500, 3400, 2500 and 500 cal yr BP. Our findings are generally consistent with other records from the ISM [Indian Summer Monsoon]  region, and suggest that the monsoon intensity is primarily controlled by solar irradiance on a centennial time scale. This external forcing may have been amplified by cooling events in the North Atlantic and by ENSO activity in the eastern tropical Pacific, which shifted the ITCZ further southwards. The inconsistency between local rainfall amount in the southeastern margin of the QTP and ISM intensity may also have been the result of the effect of solar activity on the local hydrological cycle on the periphery of the plateau.”

(16) Zhai, 2017
“ENSO is negatively/positively correlated with SSN [sunspot number] when SSN is large/small. … [S]olar activity may take effect on the ENSO, and such an impact should undergo an accumulation procedure (phase delay). XWT also indicates the existence of the impact. It is found that the index is negatively correlated with SSN when SSN is large during a certain long-term interval, and positively when SSN is small. Strong El Niño is inferred to be taken place in decade(s) to come.”

“Abrupt enhancements in the flux of pedogenic magnetite in the stalagmite agree well with the timing of known regional paleofloods and with equatorial El Niño−Southern Oscillation (ENSO) patterns, documenting the occurrence of ENSO-related storms in the Holocene. Spectral power analyses reveal that the storms occur on a significant 500-y cycle, coincident with periodic solar activity and ENSO variance, showing that reinforced (subdued) storms in central China correspond to reduced (increased) solar activity and amplified (damped) ENSO. Thus, the magnetic minerals in speleothem HS4 preserve a record of the cyclic storms controlled by the coupled atmosphere−oceanic circulation driven by solar activity.”

(18) Zhai, 2017
“The time series of sunspot number and the precipitation in the north-central China (108° ∼ 115° E, 33° ∼ 41° N) over the past 500 years (1470–2002) are investigated, through periodicity analysis, cross wavelet transform and ensemble empirical mode decomposition analysis. The results are as follows: the solar activity periods are determined in the precipitation time series of weak statistical significance, but are found in decomposed components of the series with statistically significance; the Quasi Biennial Oscillation (QBO) is determined to significantly exist in the time series, and its action on precipitation is opposite to the solar activity; the sun is inferred to act on precipitation in two ways, with one lagging the other by half of the solar activity period.”

“[W]e investigate the impact of internal climate variability and external climate forcings on ISMR on decadal to multi-decadal timescales over the past 400 years. The results show that AMO, PDO, and Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) play a considerable role in controlling the wet and dry decades of ISMR [Indian summer monsoon rainfall]. Resembling observational findings most of the dry decades of ISMR occur during a negative phase of AMO and a simultaneous positive phase of PDO.”

(20) Huo and Xiao, 2017
“In this paper, the authors investigate a particular feature, the ocean heat content (OHC) anomaly, in different phases of the total solar irradiance (TSI) cycle. The results show that almost opposite spatial patterns appear in the tropical Pacific during the ascending and declining phases of the TSI cycle. Further analysis reveals the presence of the quasi-decadal (~11-year) solar signal in the SST [sea surface temperature], OHC [ocean heat content] and surface zonal wind anomaly field over the tropical Pacific with a high level of statistical confidence (>95%). … In Misios and Schmidt (2012), the ensemble simulations from an AOGCM showed that the tropical SST oscillates almost in-phase with the 11-year solar cycle. White and Liu (2008) also found the fluctuation of the upper ocean warming to be in-phase with TSI [total solar irradiance] on the decadal scale during the twentieth century, governed by a resonant excitation of the tropical delay action oscillator and solar forcing, and the warming stage lagged the solar peak year by one to three years. … [P]atterns of OHC and potential temperature anomalies in the tropical Pacific are quite spatially symmetric in the ascending and declining phases, which seems phase-locked with the phases of the TSI cycle. The most significant regions of the OHC anomaly are locate just in the high correlation areas (beyond the 95% confidence level), which are ‘solar-sensitive’ regions with a clear quasi-11-year period.”

Increased Surface Solar Radiation (Via Reduced Cloud Cover) Explains Post-1980s Warming

(21) Sanchez-Lorenzo et al., 2017
“Trends of all-sky downward surface solar radiation (SSR) from satellite-derived data over Europe (1983–2010) are first presented. The results show a widespread (i.e., non-local dimension) increase in the major part of Europe, especially since the mid-1990s in the central and northern areas and in springtime. There is a mean increase of SSR of at least 2 W m− 2 per decade from 1983 to 2010 over the whole Europe, which, taking into account that the satellite-derived product lacks of aerosol variations, can be mostly related to a decrease in the cloud radiative effects over Europe. … Downward surface solar radiation (SSR) is a critical part of the Global Energy Balance and the climate system … A widespread decrease of SSR from the 1950s to the 1980s [when global cooling occurred] has been observed (Liepert, 2002; Stanhill and Cohen, 2001; Wild, 2009), followed by an increase of SSR since the mid-1980s [coincident with global warming]… Pinker et al. (2005) used a different product (2.5° resolution) and found that the derived global mean SSR series underwent a significant increase of 1.6 W m−2 per decade from 1983 to 2001. … On the other hand, Hatzianastassiou et al. (2005) derived a SSR product from 1984 to 2000 (2.5° resolution) and reported a significant increase of +2.4 W m−2 per decade in the global mean series, which is considerably higher than the results from Pinker et al. (2005) and Hinkelman et al. (2009).”

(22) Urban et al., 2017
“From the 1950s to the 1980s, a decline in the intensity of solar radiation was observed (Stanhill and Cohen 2001; Liepert 2002). This phenomenon was dubbed “global dimming”. Later research demonstrated that from the mid-1980s onwards, an increase in solar radiation followed, which was referred to as “global brightening” (Wild et al. 2005; Pinker et al. 2005). Reasons for shifts in radiation trends have not been fully determined; these may result from changes in atmospheric transparency caused by variations in cloud cover or concentrations of anthropogenic aerosols (Wild 2009). … An important work that covered as many as 237 stations grouped into the five climatic regions and concerned, inter alia, sunshine duration trends from 1961 to 2004 in six South American countries, was published by Raichijk (2012). The results of that study confirm downward trends in sunshine duration from the 1950s until the 1980s and upward ones since the beginning of the 1990s, which were also observed in other regions of the world. Satellite short-wave radiation data spanning the period from 1984 to 2005 confirm the results obtained at ground sunshine duration measurement stations in all five climatic regions of South America. Upward sunshine duration trends are associated with an increase in the intensity of solar radiation and a decrease in cloud cover (Raichijk 2012). It should be stressed that both insolation and cloud cover are primarily related to atmospheric circulation and are influenced by heat balance and local conditions (Dubicka and Limanówka 1994).”

"That was one of the final entries of a blog diary by Mark Baumer, a Rhode Island man who was walking barefoot across the United States to call attention to climate change. It was written on Day 90 of his trek, but his stream of photographs and anecdotes stopped on Jan. 21, Day 100. At 1:15 p. m. on that day, Mr. Baumer, 33, was walking on the shoulder of U. S. 90 in northern Florida when an S. U. V. left its lane and hit him, according to a Florida Highway Patrol report. He was pronounced dead at the site. The vast expanse of the United States has long been alluring to the men and women who set out on   hikes from coast to coast. Many have added to the tradition of travel literature, describing in their diaries the bouts of loneliness and moments of beauty, chronicling sleeping rough and under the stars, and writing of strangers who became friends. Mark Phillips was a graphic designer in New York City when he set off from Staten Island in March 2009, ending 4, 100 miles later in Los Angeles. “It was a way to drop out but have a set goal from beginning to end, but with an unpredictable journey in the middle,” he said in a telephone interview. But in the past few years, a few people who aimed to make the trip  —   whether for activism, adventure or escape  —   have died trying. For Joe Bell, the motivation was heartbreak. In 2013, Mr. Bell, 48, set off to walk from Oregon to New York City, where his gay teenage son, Jadin, who committed suicide after being bullied, had dreamed of working. After six months of walking, Mr. Bell was fatally struck on a road in Colorado by a   whose driver had apparently fallen asleep. In 2012, Andrew Moore, 20, was killed while walking on the median of a highway in Indiana, partway into his trek from Washington to San Francisco in support of a group that opposed abortion, The Mercury News in San Jose, Calif. reported. In 2010, Roger Grooters, 66, set out by bicycle from California to raise money for victims of the BP oil spill, and was just days away from completing his   trip when he was hit and killed by a pickup truck near Crystal Lake, Fla. The Pensacola News Journal reported. For Mr. Baumer, he had set up a crowdfunding campaign to draw attention to environmental problems and to benefit the FANG Collective, a   group that has opposed fracking. It has since raised more than $20, 000. He grew up in Maine but lived in Rhode Island, where he worked at Brown University’s library as a website specialist and was a student there, his website says. In 2010, he embarked on his first walk across the country, writing on his website about the animals that followed him, the people who fed him and the travails of   adventurers he met along the way, like the two bikers trying to get to Miami from Los Angeles for cancer research but who were halted in their tracks when a truck hit one of them. In October 2016, Mr. Baumer set out on his latest   hike, with financial help from a poetry fellowship he had been given from the Rhode Island State Council on the Arts. On Oct. 13, he published a video on his YouTube page as he set out on his journey with a barefoot run from Providence to Coventry. His diary took followers through Connecticut, the Bronx, Times Square and Pennsylvania. People offered him shoes, or a lift. In one encounter in Pennsylvania, he was asked if he was “one of those mountain people. ” He was on the road during the presidential election, and Mr. Baumer’s messages took on a political hue. “Since I began crossing America barefoot, I’ve seen more Trump signs than Hillary signs,” he wrote, referring to Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton. “I thought maybe I was walking through politically fringe areas or outlier territories, but last night as I sat scrolling through the news of Trump’s election on my phone, I had the weird feeling of being ignorant of how this was happening but also truly comprehending America for the first time. ” In December, he took a break from his walk down Interstate 70 and had an interview with Vice News, saying that he expected to finish his trek in March and that the best place to walk was along the white line of a road because it was smooth. “I’m constantly fighting for my space in the road,” he said. “A lot of [drivers] are like, ‘How dare you? !’” On his 98th day, in Florida, he encountered bicycle riders who were also on a   trip. They told him, he said, “We’ve met some of the worst people ever on this trip, but the landscapes are beautiful. ” On the 100th day, Mr. Baumer walked from Defuniak Springs to Mossy Head. He took a photograph of himself standing with his toes near the   word “killed” on the road, with an arrow pointing ahead. The image captured a gas line connection on a grassy lawn, and it was the last one on his blog. He sat on a bench in the rain and spoke to his father. Among the thoughts he wrote: “I spent most of the morning looking at my phone and wondering if any of the thoughts inside of it would survive. ” Lt. Eddie W. Elmore of the Florida Highway Patrol said that Mr. Baumer’s death was still under investigation. The police report said only that the driver, a    woman from Florida who had a child in the car, had “failed to maintain her lane” and entered the shoulder, striking Mr. Baumer. Mr. Baumer’s father, Jim, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday that the family was planning to set a date for a “celebration of his life” in Providence, where his son had “touched so many people,” from fellow students at Brown University, from which he graduated in 2011, to people at the farmers’ market. “We have received such an outpouring of love at a very dark and difficult period of time,” he said. Ada Smailbegovic, his girlfriend, was on a trip to Canada when she last heard from him in a brief text message. In a telephone interview on Tuesday, she said: “He wanted to have a real confrontation with the elements of the world with his body. He was moving between those two spaces. ”"
"**A man has died in Hong Kong after being hit on the head during clashes between government supporters and protesters.**
The government said the 70-year-old cleaner was on a lunch break on Wednesday when he was struck by ""hard objects hurled by masked rioters"".
In London, Hong Kong's Justice Secretary Teresa Cheng was hurt after being jostled by anti-government protesters, the Chinese embassy said.
Protests have rocked Hong Kong for months and violence is escalating.
Ms Cheng is seen as having played a key role in promoting an unpopular bill allowing extradition to mainland China, which triggered the protests. China strongly condemned the incident and called for a thorough investigation.
Chinese President Xi Jinping issued a strong warning to protesters. Speaking at a summit of BRICS countries in Brazil, he said ""radical violent activities"" in Hong Kong ""seriously challenged the [principle of] 'one country, two systems'"".
The 70-year-old was hit in the head during a protest in the Hong Kong border town of Sheung Shui.
Video purported to be of the incident shows two groups throwing bricks at each other before the man falls to the ground after being struck on the head.
A police superintendent told news outlet SCMP that the cleaner was not involved, and was ""only taking pictures at the scene"". He died in hospital on Thursday.
The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) said the man was an outsourced worker of theirs who had been on his lunch break.
The FEHD also condemned the protesters, calling them ""extremely dangerous"".
""[They] conducted violent acts in various districts three days in a row, where they wantonly assaulted other members of the public,"" the statement added. ""The acts are outrageous.""
Hong Kong has seen an escalation in violence this week, with intense street battles, violent clashes at universities, and flashmob lunchtime protests.
On Monday, a police officer shot an activist in the torso with a live bullet, and a man was set on fire while arguing with anti-government protesters.
A week ago, Alex Chow, a 22-year-old student, died after falling from a building during a police operation.
Ms Cheng was in London to promote Hong Kong as a dispute resolution and deal-making hub.
Video showed her walking towards a lecture at the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators when she was surrounded by a group of protesters.
Some held signs and shouted ""murderer"" and in the melee, Ms Cheng fell to the ground.
She regained her feet and was escorted away with no visible signs of injury, AFP reported.
A statement from the Chinese embassy in the UK said Ms Cheng had been pushed to the ground and sustained a hand injury.
It said the incident showed ""violent and lawless perpetrators"" were now taking their violence abroad.
London's Metropolitan Police told the BBC they were investigating an allegation of assault and no arrests had been made.
""A woman was taken to hospital by London Ambulance Service suffering an injury to her arm. Enquiries are ongoing to establish the full circumstances,"" a statement said.
Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam also condemned the protesters, saying ""the savage act breached the bottom line of any civilised society"".
Hong Kong - a British colony until 1997 - is part of China under a model known as ""one country, two systems"".
Under this model, Hong Kong has a high degree of autonomy and people have freedoms unseen in mainland China.
The protests started in June after the government planned to pass a bill that would allow suspects to be extradited to mainland China.
Many feared this bill would undermine the city's freedoms and judicial independence.
The bill was eventually withdrawn but the protests continued, having evolved into a broader revolt against the police, and the way Hong Kong is administered by Beijing.
Protests have taken place every weekend over the past few months, causing widespread disruption."

The Hockey Stick Collapses (2017)
A collection of 60 peer-reviewed scientific papers published in 2016 were displayed here last month in an article entitled, “The Hockey Stick Collapses: 60 New (2016) Scientific Papers Affirm Today’s Warming Isn’t Global, Unprecedented, Or Remarkable“.
Each paper from the 2016 collection cast doubt on claims of an especially unusual global-scale warming during modern times.
Yes, some regions of the Earth have been warming in recent decades (i.e., the Arctic since the 1990s), or at some point in the last 100 years.  Some regions have been cooling for decades at a time (i.e., the Arctic during the 1950s to 1980s, the Southern Ocean since 1979).  And many regions have shown no significant net changes or trends in either direction relative to the last few hundred to thousands of years.
In other words, there is nothing historically unprecedented or remarkable about today’s climate when viewed in the context of natural variability.
And the scientific evidence continues to accumulate for 2017.  In just the first month of this year, there have already been at least 17 papers published in scientific journals once again documenting that modern warming is not global, unprecedented, or remarkable.  In fact, several of these papers indicate that we are still living through some of the coldest temperatures of the last 10,000 years (just above Little Ice Age levels), and that a large portion of the amplitude of the modern warming trend (if there is one depicted) was realized prior to the mid-20th century, or before the period when human CO2 emissions began to rise dramatically.
Needless to say, these papers do not support the position that human CO2 emissions are the primary drivers of climate.

Köse et al., 2017 (Turkey, Europe)
“The reconstruction is punctuated by a temperature increase during the 20th century; yet extreme cold and warm events during the 19th century seem to eclipse conditions during the 20th century. We found significant correlations between our March–April spring temperature reconstruction and existing gridded spring temperature reconstructions for Europe over Turkey and southeastern Europe. … During the last 200 years, our reconstruction suggests that the coldest year was 1898 and the warmest year was 1873. The reconstructed extreme events also coincided with accounts from historical records. …  Further, the warming trends seen in our record agrees with data presented by Turkes and Sumer (2004), of which they attributed [20th century warming] to increased urbanization in Turkey. Considering long-term changes in spring temperatures, the 19th century was characterized by more high-frequency fluctuations compared to the 20th century, which was defined by more gradual changes and includes the beginning of decreased DTRs [diurnal temperature ranges] in the region (Turkes and Sumer, 2004).”


Flannery et al., 2017 (Florida, U.S.)
“The early part of the reconstruction (1733–1850) coincides with the end of the Little Ice Age, and exhibits 3 of the 4 coolest decadal excursions in the record. However, the mean SST estimate from that interval during the LIA is not significantly different from the late 20th Century SST mean. The most prominent cooling event in the 20th Century is a decade centered around 1965. This corresponds to a basin-wide cooling in the North Atlantic and cool phase of the AMO.”

Mayewski et al., 2017 (Antarctic Circle)

Rydval et al., 2017 (Scotland, Scandinavia, Northern Europe, Alps, France-Spain)
“[T]he recent summer-time warming in Scotland is likely not unique when compared to multi-decadal warm periods observed in the 1300s, 1500s, and 1730s … All six [Northern Hemisphere] records show a warmer interval in the period leading up to the 1950s, although it is less distinct in the CEU reconstruction. [E]xtreme cold (and warm) years observed in NCAIRN appear more related to internal forcing of the summer North Atlantic Oscillation. … There is reasonable agreement in general between the records regarding protracted cold periods which occur during the LIA and specifically around the Maunder solar minimum centred on the second half of the seventeenth century and to some extent also around the latter part of the fifteenth century coinciding with part of the Spörer minimum (Usoskin et al. 2007).”

Rosenthal et al., 2017  (Atlantic, Pacific Oceans)
“Here we review proxy records of intermediate water temperatures from sediment cores and corals in the equatorial Pacific and northeastern Atlantic Oceans, spanning 10,000 years beyond the instrumental record. These records suggests that intermediate waters [0-700 m] were 1.5-2°C warmer during the Holocene Thermal Maximum than in the last century. Intermediate water masses cooled by 0.9°C from the Medieval Climate Anomaly to the Little Ice Age. These changes are significantly larger than the temperature anomalies documented in the instrumental record. The implied large perturbations in OHC and Earth’s energy budget are at odds with very small radiative forcing anomalies throughout the Holocene and Common Era. … The records suggest that dynamic processes provide an efficient mechanism to amplify small changes in insolation [surface solar radiation] into relatively large changes in OHC.”
 




Li et al., 2017  (North China, Northern Hemisphere)
“We suggest that solar activity may play a key role in driving the climatic fluctuations in NC [North China] during the last 22 centuries, with its quasi ∼100, 50, 23, or 22-year periodicity clearly identified in our climatic reconstructions. … It has been widely suggested from both climate modeling and observation data that solar activity plays a key role in driving late Holocene climatic fluctuations by triggering global temperature variability and atmospheric dynamical circulation“
 
Kawahata et al., 2017 (Northern Japan)
“The SST [sea surface temperature] shows a broad maximum (~17.3 °C) in the mid-Holocene (5-7 cal kyr BP), which corresponds to the Jomon transgression. … The SST maximum continued for only a century and then the SST [sea surface temperatures] dropped by 3.5 °C [15.1 to 11.6 °C] within two centuries. Several peaks fluctuate by 2°C over a few centuries.”

Saini et al., 2017 (Tibetan Plateau)

Dechnik et al., 2017 (Tropical Western Pacific)
“[I]t is generally accepted that relative sea level reached a maximum of 1–1.5 m above present mean sea level (pmsl) by ~7 ka [7,000 years ago] (Lewis et al., 2013)”

Wu et al., 2017  (South China Sea)
“The alkenone-based SST reconstruction shows rapid warming in the first 1500 years of the Holocene … an increase of sea surface temperature from c. 23.0 °C to 27.0 °C, associated with a strengthened summer monsoon from c. 10,350 to 8900 cal. years BP. This was also a period of rapid sea-level rise and marine transgression, during which the sea inundated the palaeo-incised channel … In these 1500 years, fluvial discharge was strong and concentrated within the channel, and the high sedimentation rate (11.8 mm/yr [1.18 m per century]) was very close to the rate of sea-level rise.”

Sun et al., 2017  (China, Southwest)
“[A]t least six centennial droughts occurred at about 7300, 6300, 5500, 3400, 2500 and 500 cal yr BP. Our findings are generally consistent with other records from the ISM [Indian Summer Monsoon]  region, and suggest that the monsoon intensity is primarily controlled by solar irradiance on a centennial time scale. This external forcing may have been amplified by cooling events in the North Atlantic and by ENSO activity in the eastern tropical Pacific, which shifted the ITCZ further southwards. The inconsistency between local rainfall amount in the southeastern margin of the QTP and ISM intensity may also have been the result of the effect of solar activity on the local hydrological cycle on the periphery of the plateau.”

Wu et al., 2017  (Costa Rica)
“The existence of depressed MAAT [mean annual temperatures] (1.3°C lower than the 3200-year average) between 1480 CE and 1860 CE (470–90 cal. yr BP) may reflect the manifestation of the ‘Little Ice Age’ (LIA) in southern Costa Rica. Evidence of low-latitude cooling and drought during the ‘LIA’ has been documented at several sites in the circum-Caribbean and from the tropical Andes, where ice cores suggest marked cooling between 1400 CE and 1900 CE.  Lake and marine records recovered from study sites in the southern hemisphere also indicate the occurrence of ‘LIA’ cooling. High atmospheric aerosol concentrations, resulting from several large volcanic eruptions and sea-ice/ocean feedbacks, have been implicated as the drivers responsible for the ‘LIA’.”

Park, 2017 (Western Tropical Pacific)
“Late Holocene climate change in coastal East Asia was likely driven by ENSO variation.   Our tree pollen index of warmness (TPIW) shows important late Holocene cold events associated with low sunspot periods such as Oort, Wolf, Spörer, and Maunder Minimum. Comparisons among standard Z-scores of filtered TPIW, ΔTSI, and other paleoclimate records from central and northeastern China, off the coast of northern Japan, southern Philippines, and Peru all demonstrate significant relationships [between solar activity and climate]. This suggests that solar activity drove Holocene variations in both East Asian Monsoon (EAM) and El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). In particular, the latter seems to have predominantly controlled the coastal climate of East Asia to the extent that the influence of precession was nearly muted during the late Holocene.”

Pendea et al., 2017  (Russia)
“The Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) was a relatively warm period that is commonly associated with the orbitally forced Holocene maximum summer insolation (e.g., Berger, 1978; Bartlein et al., 2011). Its timing varies widely from region to region but is generally detected in paleorecords between 11 and 5 cal ka BP (e.g., Kaufman et al., 2004; Bartlein et al., 2011; Renssen et al., 2012).  … In Kamchatka, the timing of the HTM varies. Dirksen et al. (2013) find warmer-than-present conditions between 9000 and 5000 cal yr BP in central Kamchatka and between 7000 and 5800 cal yr BP at coastal sites.”
Stivrins et al., 2017  (Latvia)
“Conclusion: Using a multi-proxy approach, we studied the dynamics of thermokarst characteristics in western Latvia, where thermokarst occurred exceptionally late at the Holocene Thermal Maximum. …  [A] thermokarst active phase … began 8500 cal. yr BP and lasted at least until 7400 cal. yr BP. Given that thermokarst arise when the mean summer air temperature gradually increased ca. 2°C beyond the modern day temperature, we can argue that before that point, the local geomorphological conditions at the study site must have been exceptional to secure ice-block from the surficial landscape transformation and environmental processes.”
Bañuls-Cardona et al., 2017 (Spain)
“During the Middle Holocene we detect important climatic events. From 7000 to 6800 [years before present] (MIR 23 and MIR22), we register climatic characteristics that could be related to the end of the African Humid Period, namely an increase in temperatures and a progressive reduction in arboreal cover as a result of a decrease in precipitation. The temperatures exceeded current levels by 1°C, especially in MIR23, where the most highly represented taxon is a thermo-Mediterranean species, M. (T.) duodecimcostatus.”

For the first time, the Senate is about to vote on whether to restrict national emissions of carbon dioxide — the respiration of our civilization and our economy — in an attempt to control the world’s uncontrollable climate. This legislation has absolutely no basis in science. 



The bill in question is S.139, sponsored by Sens. Joseph Lieberman, Connecticut Democrat, and John McCain, Arizona Republican. Both are global‐​warming hawks who see an opportunity to bring about the Kyoto Protocol through a legislative back door. Both also know it won’t do a measurable thing about the Earth’s temperature and that it hasn’t a snowball’s chance in a Washington summer of passage. 



But that’s not the point. S.139 is designed to embarrass President Bush and to embolden the Senate’s green posturers by neutralizing the 1997 Byrd‐​Hagel “Sense of the Senate” Resolution which, 95–0, stated the Senate would never entertain any climate change treaty that would cost American jobs. Instead, expect S.139 to get between 30 and 40 votes. No doubt, the green lobby will crow about rapidly growing support for instruments like the Kyoto Protocol and (egad) beyond. 



Besides limiting emissions, S. 139 requires business and industry to tell the government precisely how much energy they are using, and in what forms. The purpose is to then allow businesses to “trade” their emissions with each other, for a price. Who do you think is going to pay for this? How few years does anyone think it will be before this is applied to individuals and their homes, in the form of some “environmentally responsible tax credit”? Do you want Uncle Sam knowing how you run your domicile? 



All this is intrusion into business, the economy, and, eventually, into your home, is totally unnecessary. 



Here’s what every American needs to know about global warming. Contrary to almost every news report and every staged hearing, including one held by Mr. McCain on Oct. 1, scientists know quite precisely how much the planet will warm in the foreseeable future, a modest three‐​quarters of a degree (C), plus or minus a mere quarter‐​degree, according to scientific figures as disparate as this author and NASA scientist James Hansen. The uncertainty is so small, in fact, that publicly crowing this figure is liable to result in a substantial cut in our research funding, which is why the hundreds of other scientists who know this have been so reluctant to disgorge the truth in public. 



All this has to do with basic physics, which isn’t real hard to understand. It has been known since 1872 that as we emit more and more carbon dioxide into our atmosphere, each increment results in less and less warming. In other words, the first changes produce the most warming, and subsequent ones produce a bit less, and so on. 



But we also assume carbon dioxide continues to go into the atmosphere at an ever‐​increasing rate. In other words, the increase from year‐​to‐​year isn’t constant, but itself is increasing. The effect of increasing the rate of carbon dioxide emissions, coupled with the fact that more and more carbon dioxide produces less and less warming compels our climate projections for the future warming to be pretty much a straight line. 



Translation: Once human beings start to warm the climate, they do so at a constant rate. And yes, it’s a sad fact that it took $10 billion of taxpayer money to “prove” something so obvious it can be written in a mere 100 words. 



So, once you demonstrate humans are indeed warming the climate, you know the amount of future warming. This is where the greens (and Mr. Lieberman and Mr. McCain) made a major miscalculation: They assumed that once you could demonstrate a human influence on the Earth’s surface temperature that people would be panicked into something like Kyoto. But, in reality, people are smart enough to know that a modest warming is a likely benefit, which is why they tend to move South as soon as they can afford it. 



Some more pretty straight physics, also known for a long time, is that human warming will be strongest and most obvious in very cold and dry air, such as in Siberia and northwestern North America in the dead of winter. And, not surprisingly, that’s where the lion’s share of warming is, which proves the human influence. (This is also one of the reasons Vladimir Putin opposes the Kyoto Protocol: Warming Siberia just doesn’t seem so bad to the Russians). So, now having proven humans are warming the atmosphere, ask the simple question: Is the warming indeed the straight‐​line predicted by $10 billion dollars? 



As shown in our chart, it couldn’t be straighter. Since the warming of the excessively cold air of winter began in earnest (how too bad), the deviations from a straight‐​line are vanishingly small, and projected future warming is right at the lower limit projected by the United Nations. 



Before sending me the hate mail claiming scientists would never exaggerate for political effect, let me submit it’s not just my idea this has been going on. Back in 1988, NASA’s Mr. Hansen lit the bonfire of the greenhouse vanities with some pretty incendiary testimony on the first day of summer, in the middle of a terrible and hot drought in the Midwestern and Eastern U.S. He later wrote he did this because he felt the need to call global warming to the attention of the public and the president. 



But, after a decade‐​and‐​a‐​half of reality, which resists exaggeration, it has become apparent that warming is indeed pretty modest. Jim wrote this in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2001: 



“Future global warming can be predicted much more accurately then is generally realized … we predict additional warming in the next 50 years of 0.75 ºC [plus or minus] 0.25ºC, a warming rate of 0.15ºC [plus or minus] 0.05ºC per decade.” 



This warming rate — the real one — is approximately 4 times less than the lurid top figure widely trumpeted by the United Nations and repeated ad infinitum in the press. And, just to drive my point home, here’s what Mr. Hansen wrote last month in his latest paper in the online journal Natural Science:  




Which brings us back to S.139. It’s easy to run the numbers on how much warming it “prevents,” because it’s very similar to the Kyoto Protocol, whose futility is well‐​known. The effect of both is included in our figure. You may need glasses to see the difference between doing nothing and S.139. It’s 6/100 of a degree Celsius in 50 years. That’s the amount of climate change you experience, on the average, every 10 seconds. 



Obviously, S.139 does nothing about climate, while intruding greatly into the economic life of this nation, as everyone voting for the Lieberman‐​McCain bill knows.

"Tropical forests are one of the world’s largest carbon stores and they help regulate the global climate. But they’re being erased at a terrifying rate. Deforestation claimed an area the size of Belgium in 2018. These habitats are often cleared to make way for palm oil plantations and grazing pasture for livestock. For most forests, destruction on this scale is a fairly modern phenomenon. Tropical forest ecosystems tend to have very high biodiversity, but often in the places you’d least expect. Research has found that there is often more wildlife in areas where there is an ancient history of human activity.  So how have indigenous people in tropical forests nurtured biodiversity in tropical forests while still domesticating tree species, building cities and growing crops? New research published in Trends in Plant Science suggests that the answer may be written in the trees themselves. Over 50,000 years ago, people in Borneo managed tropical forest vegetation using fire. They burned the edge of advancing forests, and this targeted disturbance was enough to prevent a large number of tall tree species dominating. It allowed habitats to regenerate that were rich in wild food plants and attractive to the animals that people hunted.

      Amazon fires: Indigenous people show fire can be used sustainably


 Other traditional methods of forest management included opening the forest canopy by carefully selecting trees to cut down. The light that flooded to the forest floor could then encourage edible species such as wild yams to grow amid the regenerating vegetation. These practices are similar to the modern ideas of edible forests and agroforestry, which maintain relatively high biodiversity and retain soil carbon and nutrient stores. Much of this is lost upon conversion to industrial plantations or ranches.   In the past, vast areas of the world’s tropical forests were managed by indigenous peoples in this way. Trees keep their own accounts of this history in their wood. It has always been thought that tropical trees have short lifespans, usually less than 400 years. But recent research shows that many tropical trees live for a very long time, and can preserve over 1,000 years of history in their timber. You’re probably familiar with the idea that you can measure how old a tree is by counting the rings beneath its bark. One ring usually equates to one year, so dendrochronology (the study of tree rings) offers a fairly easy way to understand the life of a tree. Thicker rings tend to denote a year when conditions were good for growth – ample sunshine and water – whereas thinner rings suggest a lean year of drought and competition with other trees.  Many tropical trees don’t lay down annual rings, but in the new study dendrochronologists identified over 200 species that do. Typically wider rings reflect higher rainfall, but many trees put on a growth spurt if light intensity rises. These are called release events and can happen if trees around them are cut down, allowing more light to break through the canopy. Finding these markers helps researchers to recognise and date past episodes of forest clearance. In the Amazon, these records help scientists understand the enormous extent of pre-Columbian agriculture and forest management. The rings also preserve evidence of changes in the climate through the different isotopes (types) of oxygen and carbon laid down in the wood. Carbon isotopes tend to reflect light availability and other factors that control photosynthesis, whereas oxygen isotopes help scientists track changes in a nearby water source and annual rainfall. Isotopic studies showed that the abandonment of Angkor Wat in the 14th century coincided with severe drought. Forest histories can also emerge from new DNA studies. Heavily logged species go through what we call “genetic bottlenecks”, where part of the genetic material of a species is lost as many individuals die or are unable to reproduce and pass on their genes. This leads to restricted gene pools. Researchers would expect to see the same patterns in species which were strongly affected by logging or fires started by people in the past. Genetics can also identify species that were spread by ancient people, like the Brazil nut. Living tropical trees record within themselves a history of human activity and the forest’s response to it. The regeneration of forests after disruption by people in the past offers some hope for the future, but only if current rates of deforestation can be halted, allowing the lungs of our planet to regenerate."
"**Students on exchange programmes to Hong Kong have been ordered to return to Scotland amid increasing civil unrest.**
The University of Edinburgh has recalled 21 students after Hong Kong University (HKU) cancelled classes for the rest of the term.
It follows escalating anti-government protests in recent days including violent clashes at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK).
The University of Edinburgh has partnership programmes across Asia.
CUHK saw clashes overnight on Tuesday as police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at masked protesters, who in turn started fires and threw petrol bombs.
All schools and kindergartens were closed by the education bureau on Wednesday.
On Thursday, on the HKU website, a notice was posted which effectively closed the campus down. It said it would only maintain ""essential and emergency"" services on campus.
It said: "" In view of the uncertain and unsafe traffic conditions for travelling to HKU, we are suspending classes on the main campus for the rest of the semester and making teaching and learning accessible online.
""This will enable students to stay away from campus, and even leave Hong Kong should they wish, while at the same time completing their courses and assessments.""
A spokeswoman from the University of Edinburgh said: ""The suspension of classes at educational institutions in Hong Kong has affected 21 Edinburgh students, who are currently on exchange there.
""We are therefore requesting that all of our students in Hong Kong return to the UK, at their earliest opportunity.
""We are providing advice and support to each affected student to ensure all are in a position to return to the UK.""
Tensions rose on Monday after a weekend of vigils and demonstrations after a 22-year-old student protester died on Friday.
Alex Chow fell from the ledge of a car park during a police operation a week ago.
Images on Wednesday showed students and demonstrators still at the CUHK campus, some armed with petrol bombs or other weapons including bows and arrows.
In a statement, CUHK said it was shortening the academic term and would not resume classes until 6 January 2020, ""in view of the escalation of social movements across the territory, the continuous disruption to public transport services [and] the severe damage done to facilities""."
"Dr. Heinz Lycklama (PhD in Nuclear Physics, McMaster University)
Earlier this year I started to look into the issue of Global Warming (GW) and attempted to understand why the issue had become such a controversial one. The general public has become attuned to the issue of GW and I (as an independent scientist) wanted to do my part in educating the public on the underlying science so that good public policy would be established. I assumed that science should be able to show the extent of GW and determine whether GW is due to man-made causes or to natural causes. Once we get the science right we would then know how to deal with GW. It turns out that things are a lot more complicated and unsettled than I thought they were. So I dug into the science behind GW much more thoroughly.

Guest essay by Jim Steele 
Director emeritus Sierra Nevada Field Campus, San Francisco State University and author of Landscapes & Cycles: An Environmentalist’s Journey to Climate Skepticism
Trenberth’s 1999 paper framing the effects of global warming on extreme precipitation declared, “With higher average temperatures in winter expected, more precipitation is likely to fall in the form of rain rather than snow, which will increase both soil moisture and run off, as noted by the IPCC (1996) and found in many models.” The 2001 IPCC 3rd Assessment repeated those expectations stating, “Northern Hemisphere snow cover, permafrost, and sea-ice extent are projected to decrease further.” Soon climate scientists like Dr. Viner proffered alarming scenarios that ‘children would no longer know what snow was’. Similarly in 2008 politicians like RFK Jr. warned DC children would be deprived of the fun of sledding due to global warming. But our climate naturally oscillates and by early February of 2010 Snowmageddon was blanketing the USA’s eastern seaboard with record snows, making global warming predictions the butt of many jokes. The heavy snows didn’t disprove CO2 had caused any warming, but it definitely highlighted failed predictions.
In 2011 Chris Mooney writing for the DeSmog blog noted heavy snowfall had become a “communications nightmare” for global warming theory and urged, “We need to move the public to a place where drawing a warming-snowstorm connection isn’t so challenging”. Kevin Trenberth was already on point. Just two weeks after the 2010 Snowmageddon, Trenberth appeared in a NPR interview flip-flopping to a new climate change framework in which a “Warming Planet Can Mean More Snow”. Now he argued, “The fact that the oceans are warmer now than they were, say, 30 years ago means there’s about on average 4 percent more water vapor lurking around over the oceans than there was, say, in the 1970s”. Thus “you can get dumped on with more snow partly as a consequence of global warming,” A year later the Union of Concerned Scientists held a press conference asserting global warming was no longer causing less snow, but causing heavier snow. And now, every year as heavy snowstorms approach, Trenberth and his well-groomed media outlets bombard the public, urging them not to be misled by their senses, but trust that cold and snowy days have worsened due to global warming.
Trenberth bases his warmer-earth-more-cold-and-snow alchemy on the Clausius–Clapeyron relation stating, “the water holding capacity of the atmosphere goes up exponentially at a rate of 7% per degree Celsius.” Indeed the Clausius–Clapeyron relation is undeniable physics. The problem is Trenberth misapplies it. First as seen in the graph below from the peer-reviewed paper Weather And Climate Analyses Using Improved Global Water Vapor Observations, there is little evidence of a steady increase in total precipitable water vapor (TPW) ever paralleling rising CO2. The important question Trenberth never asked was, “if TPW has declined since 1998, has there been no warming since 1998?” Indeed in accord with less water vapor, several top climate scientists have reported a global warming hiatus over the same period and the Climate Reference Network reports no warming trend over the USA for the past decade. Furthermore, ocean temperatures were in agreement. Based on Argo data a consensus of scientists reported heat content in the upper 300 meters of the ocean had “increased from 1984 to 1992 followed by a short cooling episode in 1992/93, and then increased from 1994 to 2003/2004, followed by flattening or a decrease.” Note the decline in water vapor from 1992 to 1994 and the decline since 1998 coincides with those ocean temperatures. All things considered, the uptick in heavier snow since 2009 cannot be explained by Trenberth’s new normal “warmer and wetter” assumption.
“Old school” scientists seek to understand causes of extreme events by examining changes in atmospheric circulation and other contributing weather dynamics. In contrast Trenberth does not want scientists to use the standard null hypothesis to test if CO2 warming was a contributing factor. He simply assumes CO2 must be and accuses other researchers of erroneously accepting the standard null hypothesis indicating no effect from rising CO2 (type 2 errors). Based on pure assumptions, he wants to allot some portion of every extreme event to rising CO2, even when an no anthropogenic signal emerges from standard scientific analyses and modeling experiments, as discussed in part 1. According to Trenberth, due to the dominating effects of natural variability, CO2-driven climate models do a very poor job of simulating large changes in atmospheric circulation. While one model run will force large changes, the next model run will not. To side step that problem, instead of asking if there have been trends in atmospheric and oceanic circulation changes that produced snowfall extremes, Trenberth wants researchers to simply ask, “Was it [snowfall] related to higher than normal SSTs off the coast or farther afield” and then assume those higher temperatures were partly due to rising CO2. But that’s bad science. Higher than normal sea surface temperatures often have no connection to any theoretical CO2 heating. Warmer sea surface temperatures associated with a storm can be solely caused by a redistribution of warm water during an El Nino event. A shift in the North Atlantic Oscillation, or a shift in the jet stream can reduce wind fields and warm sea surfaces because weaker winds ventilate less heat and reduce evaporative cooling. Elsewhere shifts in atmospheric circulation can reduce cloudiness and increase solar heating.

Trenberth has reported that 70% of the moisture involved in a storm is typically in place at the beginning of the storm, suggesting global warming has increased the available moisture. But again observations do not support Trenberth’s simplistic “warmer and wetter” attributions. For example in the 2011 Groundhog Day Blizzard the amount of available water vapor was far below normal as seen in the diagram posted by meteorologist Joseph D’Aleo at WUWT. So another question Trenberth’s attribution studies must ask, “where does the moisture come from for an extreme snow event when a region is not “warmer and wetter?”

Still there are many useful questions that can be asked to determine if the affects of climate change have exceeded the boundaries of natural variability. For example, do similar extreme snowfalls happen independently of sea surface temperatures that are warmer or cooler than normal? That question is easily answered from a historical perspective that encompasses just 100 to 150 years. Historical extremes like the Great Blizzard of 1888 dropped very similar amounts of snow on America’s northeast, despite a very different climate background with colder ocean temperatures from the Little Ice Age and extensive Arctic sea ice. Comparing the Great Blizzard of 1888 with Snowmaggedon, higher than normal SST temperatures do not appear to be a critical factor.
To separate natural weather dynamics from climate change scientists must also establish why snowfall varies greatly over small timeframes; timeframes that are too short for CO2 to hypothetically alter ocean temperatures. As anyone having lived in New England knows, during any given winter the depth of snowfall is totally dependent on 2 crucial factors: 1) how fast the storm moves along the coast and 2) how far from the coast the storm travels. Unquestionably slow moving storms cause the most extreme precipitation events, rain or snow. For the American east coast, colder than normal temperatures south of Greenland encourage more frequent blocking ridges of high pressure, and those blocks cause storms to slow down and even stall. These “Greenland blocks” were also responsible for Superstorm Sandy’s sudden shift back towards the coast.
Greenland blocks are more common during negative phases of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), a phase that has coincided with the recent rise in heavy snowstorms. So we must also ask if global warming has affected a shift to the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)? But previous research had suggested increased CO2 promoted a more positive NAO during the latter decades of the 20th century. Within a framework of a single year or a few decades, shifts in the NAO are often associated changes in snowfall. But if we ask if climate change altered trends in a given NAO phase, researchers report in the paper Need for Caution in Interpreting Extreme Weather Statistics, “no significant changes either in the mean or in the entire PDFs [Probability Density Functions]” of the NAO index over the last 140 years.
As illustrated in the diagram below, the positions of cold air masses on land and warm air masses over the ocean determine where precipitation falls as snow or rain. For example during the Blizzard of 2013, despite being surrounded by warm ocean waters Nantucket Island received the least amount of snowfall (6.3 inches) while further west Providence Rhode Island (18 inches) and Hartford, Connecticut (22.8 inches) surrounded by a colder air mass received record snow. For snow to form, moist warm air must be raised to an altitude where temperatures are below freezing, with an optimal snow forming temperature hovering around -12 degrees C (10F). Typically a cold air mass (or mountains) forces the rise in altitude. According to the Clausius-Clapeyron relation, air at 31 degree F can only hold a given amount of moisture, no matter how greatly the global average temperature varies. The critical factor that determines how much snow will accumulate is the temperature of the air nearer the ground. If lower air layers are warmer than 0°C (32F), the snow will melt as it falls forming rain, freezing rain or sleet. Only where the entire air column is below freezing do we get snow. If the storm track moves too far out to sea, or if the cold air mass is to far inland, the warm air mass gets less lift, and much less snow forms. Thus to attribute the cause of extreme snowfall a scientist must also ask, “what was the position of the storm track?” And how much cold air was in place?
Trenberth cavalierly suggests that it’s always cold enough to snow in winter, but that that is misleading. For blizzards to occur sufficient cold air must already be in place and that is not a given. Dips in the jet stream and storm tracks across North America pull cold Arctic air southward along the storms trailing edge. To produce Snowmageddon blizzards along the east coast, enough cold air had to reach the southeast and overflow the Appalachian barrier where it is dammed up along the coast (Rauber 2005). The snows that reached Jacksonville Florida in 2015 were the result of a stronger than normal flow of cold air over the Appalachians. Similar to “lake effect snow”, after flowing over the ocean, the cold dry air picked up enough moisture to dust Jacksonville with light snows.
Accordingly the National Snow and Ice Data Center experts tell us, “While it can be too warm to snow, it cannot be too cold to snow. Snow can occur even at incredibly low temperatures as long as there is some source of moisture and some way to lift or cool the air”. In contrast, Mooney relays Trenberth’s message contradicting those experts stating, “Heavy snows mean the temperature is just below freezing, any cooler and the amount would be a lot less.”… “Warmer waters off the coast help elevate winter temperatures and contribute to the greater snow amounts. This is how global warming plays a role.” Why would Trenberth make that up?
Dips in the jet stream and stronger storms capable of pulling an abundance of cold Arctic air equatorward are often associated with the negative phase of the North Atlantic/Arctic Oscillation (AO). Although December 2015 had been mild, when weather forecasters recognized a shift to the AO’s negative phase in early January 2016, they correctly predicted conditions would be just right for the Blizzard of 2016 that buried the mid-Atlantic States in 2 feet of snow 2 weeks later. So to explain contributions of extreme snowfall, scientists must ask how do natural cycles of the North Atlantic/Arctic Oscillation contribute to extremes.

As would be predicted by a shift to more frequent negative phases of the NAO/AO, the USA was experiencing greater incursions of cold Arctic air that promoted both more record low temperatures and greater snowfall, as was the case in the 1960s and 70s. Despite projections by CO2 driven models that the ratio of record high temperatures would exceed record low temperatures by 20 to 1 in 2050, in 2013 and 2014 record low temperatures exceeded record highs. However to counter such contradictory observations, Trenberth pushes another unscientific and non-falsifiable explanation. Suggesting risingCO2 was preventing extreme cold that he claims reduce snowfall, Trenberth submitted,
“below normal temperatures can be fully consistent with climate change but are likely warmer than they otherwise would have been.”
Winter storms are low-pressure systems, or cyclones, that spin in a counter-clockwise direction as they travel across North America. Most winter cyclones in North America are initiated by the curvature of the jet stream as it passes around the Rocky Mountains, or curve northward along the eastern seaboard. The North American topography favors two major storm centers in western North America. One lies just east of the Canadian Rockies where “Alberta Clippers” form. Clippers are fasting moving storms. Typically they will not produce record heavy snowfall because the moisture supply flowing into northern North America is relatively low and the Clippers’ swift passage does not allow for sustained snow accumulation. However Clippers can evolve into major storms over the Great Lakes or eastern seaboard where moisture is available or when they align with storms initiated by the subtropical jet stream. The other storm center lies just east of Colorado. These storms often gather more moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and are slower moving. Typically these storms deliver heavier snowfall. Of importance to east coast snowfall, either storm type will pull cold Arctic air southward and eastward toward the coast, setting the stage for greater snowfall totals from the next storm. In fact it was an Alberta Clipper that set the stage for the east coast Blizzard of 2015.
In general as illustrated below, there are 3 air masses that interact with a winter storm. 1) The cooler air that was left in place from a previous storm. This cooler air mass forces the approaching warm air to rise to altitudes where water vapor can turn to snow. 2) Warm moist air from the Gulf of Mexico or tropical Atlantic that is pulled northward by the storm’s leading edge. 3) The cold dry Arctic air pulled southward along the storms trailing edge. Mild warm conditions generated from the warm air mass typically precede a blizzard, and often catch people ill prepared for the bitter cold that follows. The most famous incident was the January 1888 School Children’s Blizzard that swept through the Great Plains. It was so named because of the 235 people who were killed, many were children who headed to school “lightly dressed because temperatures had been gradually rising to just above freezing as warm moist air was pulled up from the Gulf of Mexico. However within a few hours temperatures dropped to -29 degrees C, as the cold Arctic air advanced. Due to this counter-clockwise circulation pattern, strong storms can reverse a region’s normal latitudinal temperature gradient, temporarily making it warmer in the north and colder in the south.

When storms track along the east coast, they intensify due to the sharp contrast between warm Atlantic temperatures and cold land temperatures. The sharp contrast favors “explosive cyclogenesis”, a phenomenon that is most common along the Gulf Stream and along the Kuroshio Current and promotes extreme snowfalls in New England and Japan respectively. In addition to the land-sea contrast, there is also a steep temperature gradient over the Atlantic due to the warm Gulf Stream. Along the coast of North Carolina in February, coastal waters are typically 10 degrees C (50 F), while just 130 kilometers to the east, Gulf Stream waters register 22 degrees C (72 F) Reddy 1994. In addition to the heat and moisture evaporating from warm Gulf Stream waters, winter storms travelling up the coast will pull warm moist tropical air northward in what is called the “warm conveyor” as illustrated below in the Washington Post illustration of the 2015 blizzard. Notice the head of the storm’s “comma” shape is an area of extreme snowfall, where the storm had pulled warm and moist air northward and westward which then rose over the colder air already in place from previous storms.

Nevertheless ignoring all the potent weather dynamics that naturally drive anomalously warmer sea surface temperatures ahead of a storm, Trenberth emailed his favorite media outlets Joe Romm, Chris Mooney and others to assert, “At present sea surface temperatures are more the 2 degrees F above normal over huge expanses (1000 miles) off the east coast and water vapor in the atmosphere is about 10% higher as a result. About half of this can be attributed to climate change.”
Was this 50% contribution ever scientifically tested and peer reviewed? Did Trenberth determine “how much warmth was transported northward on the warm conveyor side of the storm?” Did Trenberth ask how much warmth was picked up from the Gulf Stream and carried westward to cooler coastal waters? Did the storm temporarily reverse the latitudinal temperature gradient? Trenberth’s untested opinion of a 50% contribution attributed to rising CO2 was simply an opinion. It was an opinion pushed to satisfy the “need to move the public to a place where drawing a warming-snowstorm connection isn’t so challenging” and thus protect the global warming theory.
More yellow journalism followed a few weeks later in Mooney’s “What the massive snowfall in Boston tells us about global warming”. Keeping the focus on global warming Mooney reported, “sea surface temperatures off the coast of New England are flashing red”. Michael Mann added to the global warming meme reporting, “Sea surface temperatures off the coast of New England right now are at record levels, 11.5C (21F) warmer than normal in some locations.” But Mooney, Mann and Trenberth were not interested in discussing the details of those fleeting warm anomalies. They never considered the warm conveyor delivered above normal warmth northwards and then dragged that warmth and Gulf Stream warmth westward. They never tell us how fleeting those warm anomalies were. Yet for the month of February 2015 temperatures on land and sea were all several degrees colder than normal as seen in the illustration by CBSBoston’s chief meteorologist. It was extreme cold that intensified the storm. And despite below normal sea surface temperatures and thus below normal water vapor, the storm gathered enough moisture and Boston experienced record-breaking snows.

Trenberth has now revised his 1999 framework. Despite the record cold that reduces water vapor, he still argues global warming causes more snow in winter. He maintains warming will still cause more rain and reduced snow in the fall and spring. But again the evidence contradicts his claims. Although Trenberth focuses public attention on a decreasing trend in spring snow extent, like the winter, there has also been an increasing trend in autumn snow extent as seen in the graph below from Rutgers Global Snow Lab.

So why does Trenberth persist in claiming extreme snowfalls are due to a warmer and wetter world. Trenberth betrays his intentions when he writes, “The main way climate change is perceived is through changes in extremes because those are outside the bounds of previous weather. Climate change from human influences is difficult to perceive and detect because natural weather-related variability is large. Even with a significant climate change, most of the time, the weather is within previous bounds.” So Trenberth has organized a media campaign to not only overturn the null hypothesis, but to reverse our understanding of the difference between climate and weather. He wants you believe every extreme weather event is worsened by CO2, whether or not there is any evidence.
In part three: Trenberth’s repression of alternative scientific explanations.

Coccolithophores are calcifying phytoplankton that comprise the base of marine food webs all across the world ocean. They play an important role in the cycling of carbon into the deep ocean and act as a feedback to climate change. Anything that alters their function or abundance, therefore, could have significant impacts on marine ecosystems and global climate. Thus, it is no surprise that scientists are interested in how coccolithophores will respond to future changes in atmospheric CO2 and climate. And in this regard, Krumhardt _et al_. (2016) say there has been “much speculation [that has] inspired numerous laboratory and mesocosm experiments, but how they are currently responding in situ is less well documented.” Working to provide just such an in situ analysis, the team of four researchers thus set out to analyze coccolithophore abundance in the subtropical North Atlantic over the period 1990 to 2014.   
  
To accomplish their objective, Krumhardt _et al_. used coccolithophore pigment data collected at the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) site (located at 31.7°N, 64.2°W in the Sargasso Sea) in conjunction with satellite estimates of surface chlorophyll and particulate inorganic carbon as a proxy measure of coccolithophore abundance. Results of their analysis revealed that “coccolithophore populations in the North Atlantic subtropical gyre have been increasing significantly over the past two decades. More specifically, they note there was a 37 percent increase in euphotic zone-integrated (integrated from 140 m depth) in coccolithophore pigment abundance at BATS and a larger 68 percent increase in the upper 30 m of the water column (see figure below). Such findings, in the words of the authors, add to those of a growing number of studies showing that coccolithophores in the North Atlantic “are increasing in abundance and are likely stimulated by additional carbon from anthropogenic sources.”   




The significance of Krumhardt _et al_.’s work is two-fold. First, they note that the increased coccolithophore abundance they found “is contrary to what numerous laboratory studies have predicted, highlighting the importance of in situ observations,” as observations clearly suggest that coccolithophores _benefit_ from higher levels of atmospheric CO2. Second, for those who are concerned about the potential climatic impacts of CO2-induced global warming, the increase in coccolithophore abundance is providing a natural brake on increasing levels of atmospheric CO2, as more carbon is exported to the deep ocean with their increased abundance. What is more, Krumhardt _et al_. note that in addition to transporting more carbon into the deep ocean, coccolithophores produce dimethyl sulfide, a marine trace gas that affects cloud formation and acts as a negative feedback to climate warming (see Dimethyl Sulfide for background on this topic). Thus, it is that the four researchers conclude that overall increases in coccolithophore abundance will likely induce “a multitude of effects on marine ecosystems in the North Atlantic, as well as global carbon cycling and climate,” all of which, we note, appear to be for the better.

"US climate advocates have their highest-profile evidence yet that putting the crisis first can win elections. And it arrived in an unlikely package: a 74-year-old Senate incumbent, who garnered intense grassroots support from young activists.  Ed Markey this week won a decisive victory in the Massachusetts Democratic primary election over Joe Kennedy who was challenging for his seat, the latest scion of the American political dynasty who had backing from the country’s top Democrat, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi. John Podesta, who was Barack Obama’s climate adviser, said Markey’s win “sent a resounding message: the politics of climate have changed and embracing bold climate action is a winning message in tough races”. Markey was trailing Kennedy earlier in the race, before the youth-led Sunrise Movement intervened to back him as one of their biggest allies in the Senate. Volunteers phone-banked and provided the content for a much-heralded campaign ad where Markey repurposed John F Kennedy’s historic phrase as president and told Americans to “start asking what your country can do for you”. It came as no surprise that climate was the major focus of Markey’s campaign. He introduced the Green New Deal alongside the New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez last year. And his name is on the Waxman-Markey climate bill of 2009, which is the closest Congress has ever come to taking significant action on climate change. For years, polls have shown that a majority of Americans are concerned about climate change, and many rank it among their top issues. But few campaigns have sought to make virtually an entire campaign about the crisis as Markey did. “We see that climate has risen as a major issue for Democrats and is especially important to the more progressive wing of the Democratic party,” said Edward Maibach, who directs George Mason University’s Center for Climate Change Communication and routinely surveys Americans on the issue. “I think that came through loudly and clearly, and we’re going to see it come through loudly and clearly in other elections this fall.” Varshini Prakash, the executive director of the Sunrise Movement, said the group’s volunteers made hundreds of thousands of calls to encourage voters to support Markey. A hub of high-schoolers in Lexington, Massachusetts, conducted 14 phone-banking events even before they joined up with the national group, she said. Prakash said: “There is no more visible leader on the Green New Deal than Ed Markey, save AOC [Ocasio-Cortez].  “We realized early on … this was a guy who we haven’t always agreed with necessarily but who championed our flagship policy and somebody that we had to defend at all costs.” As the group Data for Progress put it shortly before the election: “Markey is an ally, and the left is out to prove that becoming an ally is more than just not a hazard to your career – it’s a benefit.” Climate advocacy isn’t always a silver bullet. In another race in Massachusetts, Alex Morse, the progressive climate candidate challenging the House ways and means chairman, Richard Neal, lost. But Maggie Thomas, political director at advocacy group Evergreen Action, said the climate crisis is no longer just one campaign issue among many. With hurricanes on the Gulf coast, wildfires in California and a derecho – an intense wind storm – in Iowa, she said: “We are seeing the effects of climate all around us. “Climate change looks different in lots of different places. The specifics of how Markey campaigned on climate doesn’t mean it’s an exact plug-and-play for how someone else might run on climate, but I think that what it does show is that you can campaign on climate and you can win on climate.”"

Guest opinion: Dr. Tim Ball
The public face of climate science practiced by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), and their offspring the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) were for a political agenda and only secondarily for the money it engendered. However, their methods were made much more effective by magazines and journals who promoted their flawed science primarily for money and sometimes secondarily for politics. Magazines and Journals, often with considerable influence, latched on like giant sucker fish to further themselves not to promote truth, accuracy, and public understanding.
There was a time when Scientific American (SA) occupied a unique niche on the newsstands. It was a magazine about science for the public. It was genuine science usually written by scientists, not a popular pseudo-science magazine like all the others. It was interesting because most people did not understand much of what was written. People that knew about the topic realized it was a very broad overview, but realized it was for public consumption. They published fascinating articles drawing issues to public attention without political bias. Three I recall that were valuable in the climate debate were; John Eddy’s article on the missing sunspots; Stommel and Stommel’s piece on 1816, the year with no summer; and an early article about the influence on ocean temperature measurements of the switch from leather to metal buckets and then engine intakes.
Now, SA is a sensationalist, biased, apologist outlet for the IPCC global warming science. It appears the transition was driven, even before the full impact of the internet, by declining sales. Now, in my opinion, SA is no different from any of the other pseudo-science sensationalist magazines. Coincident with the shift was a decline in contributions from scientists and an increase in articles by professional (?) journalists. With climate articles, the majority came from scientists directly involved in the IPCC deception. Doom and gloom and sensationalism sells and even better if it fits the political bias of those involved in producing the magazine.
The same pattern developed with the two pre-eminent journals Science and Nature. There was a time when academics paid to have articles published and also paid for receiving a quantity of the article once published. There was a period when universities paid for subscriptions and a few academics purchased their own. As the cost of producing the journals increased subscription costs became prohibitive. This coincided with declining government and private monies to researchers and universities. Some publishing houses, such as Elsevier, saw a business opportunity and took over. We are all now familiar with the ‘paywall’. We also experience the merchandizing that occurs if you buy an article. It triggers an ongoing email promotion of “articles that might be of interest” similar to the follow ups from Amazon.
As global warming became a bigger political issue some in the media began searching for sensational scientific speculation articles. They were written up with the active voice headline declaring “scientist says,” then followed by an article with some of the conditional phrases academics use to temper their arguments. A major problem is that few journalists have science degrees or any scientific training. This means they only look at the science that feeds their sensationalist, “the story is everything” objective.
Some journals spawned different vehicles to expand circulation and exploit sensationalism. Nature started Nature Climate Change in 2007. I was made aware of its existence and bias at the 2009 Heartland Climate Conference when a reporter from that publication asked for an interview. I quickly realized he was not interested in objectivity or elucidation so terminated the interview.
Their editorial policy is set out on their home page as
Reading science
Scientists are often accused of poorly communicating their findings, but improving scientific literacy is everyone’s responsibility.
True, but only if it is balanced and objective. 
Nature Climate Change is owned by the Nature Publishing Group that is a division of Macmillan Publishers Limited. This is interesting because they were the publishers involved with the Velikovsky travesty, one of the most egregious examples of the conflicts that occur between publishers and a search for the truth. You can read Velikovsky’s side of the story in his book Stargazers and Gravediggers that Amazon describes as follows.
In one of the greatest acts of censorship in American history, a powerful lobby of establishment scientists forced Macmillan to suspend publication of Immanuel Velikovsky’s “Worlds in Collision” – the first shot fired in the campaign against Velikovsky’s “heretical” views. Here, with enormous dignity and intelligence, Velikovsky himself tells the full story of one of the most shameful book-burning episodes of our time. This is Velikovsky’s final word on the matter, and it forms an important inside account of a scandal that shook the worlds of science and publishing alike.
Velikovsky became a target for Carl Sagan, an early promoter of human CO2 caused global warming. That claim became central to the argument about the threat of higher CO2 levels. He challenged the claims of the levels and cause of temperatures on Venus. Sagan felt so threatened that he published a book Scientists Confront Velikovsky. It is about all his claims thus collectively including Venusian CO2. He is not to be believed on anything.
 

The interactions between publishers and scientists at the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) were revealed by the leaked emails in the Climategate scandal. On the web site Reason a 2009 article titled Climategate and Scientific Journal Chicanery by Ronald Bailey reports on the experiences of Eduardo Zorita.
By writing these lines I will just probably achieve that a few of my future studies will, again, not see the light of publication. My area of research happens to be the climate of the past millennia, where I think I am appreciated by other climate-research ‘soldiers’….
I may confirm what has been written in other places: research in some areas of climate science has been and is full of machination, conspiracies, and collusion, as any reader can interpret from the CRU-files. They depict a realistic, I would say even harmless, picture of what the real research in the area of the climate of the past millennium has been in the last years. The scientific debate has been in many instances hijacked to advance other agendas.
These words do not mean that I think anthropogenic climate change is a hoax. On the contrary, it is a question which we have to be very well aware of. But I am also aware that in this thick atmosphere and I am not speaking of greenhouse gases now- editors, reviewers and authors of alternative studies, analysis, interpretations, even based on the same data we have at our disposal, have been bullied and subtly blackmailed. In this atmosphere, Ph. D students are often tempted to tweak their data so as to fit the ‘politically correct picture’. Some, or many issues, about climate change are still not well known. Policy makers should be aware of the attempts to hide these uncertainties under a unified picture. I had the ‘pleasure’ to experience all this in my area of research.
The important point here is that Zorita expects retribution from the reviewers and editors thus making them accessories before and after the fact.
Another way to control the message is to be both reviewer and journal editor. This appears to be what happened in the dominance of IPCC and CRU scientists as editors of the Journal of Climate. Donna Laframboise poses the question
We’re supposed to trust the conclusions of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) because much of the research on which it relies was published in peer-reviewed scientific journals.
But what happens when the people who are in charge of these journals are the same ones who write IPCC reports?
After listing all the people, some 13 by my count, who served as editors or in some other editorial capacity on the Journal, Laframboise asks,
“Is no one concerned that there is no distance whatsoever – never mind anything approaching a firewall – between the people who decide whether a study deserves to join the haloed ranks of the scientific peer-reviewed literature – and the people who then write IPCC reports declaring what this peer-reviewed literature tells us about climate change?
And let’s not even talk about what percentage of the published papers authored by some of those mentioned above earned their peer-reviewed status via the Journal of Climate. That’s another story for another day.” 
In an article written shortly after the leaked emails appeared Robert Tracinski said,
“Not content to block out all dissent from scientific journals, the CRU scientists also conspired to secure friendly reviewers who could be counted on to rubber-stamp their own work. Phil Jones suggests such a list to Kevin Trenberth, with the assurance that “All of them know the sorts of things to say…without any prompting.”
Sadly, many were willing for various reasons. Tracinski summary is telling.
The picture that emerges is simple. In any discussion of global warming, either in the scientific literature or in the mainstream media, the outcome is always predetermined. Just as the temperature graphs produced by the CRU are always tricked out to show an upward-sloping “hockey stick,” every discussion of global warming has to show that it is occurring and that humans are responsible. And any data or any scientific paper that tends to disprove that conclusion is smeared as “unscientific” precisely because it threatens the established dogma.
A major factor in making journals and magazines vulnerable to persuasion from the people at CRU was the business model applied and the requirement for a profitable operation. It was the practice of the business world to either ignore the science as I explained in an earlier article or donate money to those attacking them in a form of corporate market place appeasement. Proof of this is seen in the fact that one company fighting back makes a headline – Exxon Stands Up to the green Bullies.
The real breakthrough will come when this headline appears in the mainstream media, but don’t hold your breath, there is much more money available as long as government funding continues.

For the record I’ve never supported Velikovsky’s ideas in the book Worlds In Collision. But I DO support discussing them in the context of learning, because if you can’t learn from mistakes, you aren’t doing science. – Anthony Watts

Of late, U.S.-China relations seem to be on a more secure footing.1 After the Sunnylands summit in May 2013, some modest steps have occurred to indicate an improving climate for security cooperation among the superpowers: a joint anti‐​piracy exercise was held in the Gulf of Aden, several Chinese ships came to Hawaii to participate in another exercise, and China’s navy chief has made an official visit to the United States. But don’t believe the hype.2



Such symbolic steps simply move the relationship from deeply fraught to extremely tense. Those largely cosmetic measures will do little to break down the veritable chasm of “strategic mistrust” that presently divides Washington and Beijing. Indeed, tensions arising in late 2013 over the new Chinese Air Defense Identification Zone over the East China Sea and a new naval incident involving a near collision between Chinese and U.S. warships in the South China Sea seem to demonstrate how strained the overall relationship remains. Moreover, active bilateral cooperation on the key global issues of the day, from nuclear proliferation to climate change, is almost completely stalled, in no small part as a result of the damage caused by the Obama administration’s rebalancing to the Asia‐​Pacific. To be sure, China is feeling its oats, and that quite natural process will continue to introduce significant tensions into U.S.-China relations. However, Washington can and must do much more to ameliorate those strains.



Above all, China is hardly the first‐​order threat to U.S. national security that proponents of the “pivot” and Air‐​Sea Battle are claiming. China’s military modernization is real and quite rapid, but the actual threat to the United States is minimal, and the risks can be mitigated quite easily with appropriate and limited steps to hedge against those lowprobability risks. This chapter evaluates China’s military modernization, explains the related risk scenarios, and lays out simple and costeffective U.S. hedging strategies. It will also touch on how creative diplomacy or “smart power” can further reduce risk in U.S.-China relations and thus decrease the burden on limited U.S. national security resources.



China’s rapidly modernizing military has brought with it more than a little analytical confusion. A side‐​by‐​side comparison against U.S. forces (e.g., 11 U.S. nuclear aircraft carriers versus a single Chinese conventional “test” aircraft carrier) makes for almost a joke in national security circles. The most inflated estimates of Chinese military power that see Beijing quickly converting its economic prowess into military might must, therefore, be rejected on two principal counts, aside from the stark numbers already mentioned. First, China’s armed forces are rising from a very low level of technology and proficiency. Second, China has prioritized internal economic development (e.g., high‐​speed rail) over military development, a trend unlikely to reverse in the near term. Nevertheless, it is important not to overestimate U.S. military advantages in any armed conflict with China. China has actually pulled ahead in some discreet but important domains of modern warfare. Moreover, the enormous weight of geography tends to negate many, if not most, U.S. advantages when actual scenarios are analyzed. However, the bottom line is that Beijing is building a military neither to attack the United States nor to conquer East Asia. Rather, the present trajectory for the development of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) befits a great power, with outsized insecurities to be sure, but that is also exercising considerable restraint and has certain specific global concerns.



It is natural at the outset of any serious analysis of U.S.-China strategic interaction to pose certain questions regarding the overall trajectory of China’s social, economic, and political conditions in the coming decades. Indeed, many of the most pessimistic assessments of China seem to be premised on the seemingly stark ideological contrast between Washington and Beijing; in other words, good versus evil. For that most skeptical of viewpoints, the Chinese are not simply out to dominate Asia, but they have designs on the Americas and Europe as well.3 At the opposite end of the spectrum are extremely dovish forecasts that claim that China’s rise is mostly a fiction or a “Potemkin village”—hardly worth a mention and certainly incapable of posing any kind of a threat, except to itself.4



A more complete analysis of China’s internal development dynamics and the relationship of those trends to China’s likely foreign policy goals in the future is beyond the scope of this chapter. Nonetheless, it is worthwhile to briefly state a few basic assumptions in that regard.



The Chinese economy is robust and growing, and its colossal energy is evident to anyone who has taken the time to stroll around any of its myriad second‐​tier cities that make up its enormous industrial base. Impediments to continued rapid growth exist, to be sure, and the Chinese economy will likely slow further from its previously blistering pace, but conventional forecasts show that the Chinese economy is on track to exceed that of the United States in aggregate size by 2020.5



Likewise, the Chinese polity is similarly less brittle than has often been assumed by Western commentators. Indeed, Chinese leaders have painstakingly studied the example of the disintegration of the Soviet Union and are determined not to follow that path. Nor have stagnation in Europe, paralysis in the United States, or chaos in much of the Middle East in the wake of the Arab Spring convinced them to rethink their skepticism regarding democracy and democratization. China’s political institutions remain in flux and are still afflicted by major problems—corruption foremost among them—but the notion that rule by the Chinese Communist Party is on the brink of collapse is belied by the apparently high levels of public trust that researchers have found in China, even compared with Western democracies.6 It is certainly possible that Beijing’s polity could undergo substantial change in the next few decades, but the political order put in place by Deng Xiaoping has proved remarkably stable in almost all respects, suggesting that continuity should form the baseline projection.



Three additional caveats should be kept in mind when considering linkages between Chinese domestic and foreign policies. First, the assumption that regime change in Beijing would fundamentally alter Chinese foreign policy is quite tenuous. Thus, it is possible to conceive of a situation in which a more liberal polity in China could be even more assertive as various political interests competed to showcase their nationalist credentials. Second, another liberal assumption that the Chinese regime is too dependent on economic growth and trade specifically to risk international conflict is somewhat persuasive, but it may not in the end form a reliable mechanism to preserve the peace. The explanation is simply that rationality may fail to carry the day, and Chinese elites may be even more prone to emotive nationalist appeals, especially given the country’s tortured modern history. Third and most fundamental, it should be kept in mind at all times that the situation confronting contemporary China (both domestically and internationally) is unprecedented. At a minimum, that means that there will be much uncertainty regarding Beijing’s preferred course in foreign policy, which also offers ample scope for both positive and negative reverberations across the Pacific expanse. In other words, U.S. policy, whether confrontational or accommodative, can play a major role in shaping future Chinese preferences and strategies.



Putting aside the many complexities and uncertainties of Chinese politics, let us return to the more narrow task of evaluating the military balance, wherein a side‐​by‐​side comparison of U.S. and Chinese military forces can be misleading for certain scenarios. A few quick comparisons serve to demonstrate the baseline of strong U.S. superiority in most military domains. For the foreseeable future, moreover, the United States will remain quite dominant in any total clash of arms. China’s “new” aircraft carrier Liaoning—launched in the fall of 2012 on a refurbished hull originally built by the Soviets back in the 1980s and acquired from Ukraine in 1998—may be taken as reasonably reflective of the overall balance of military forces. Although the primary J-15 fighter for the carrier seems to be reasonably capable, the capabilities of the initial Chinese carrier overall are vastly reduced by its conventional propulsion and lack of catapults. In practice, the carrier is much more difficult to sustain in combat, and its aircraft cannot carry heavy payloads (fuel and weaponry). There is no firm evidence, moreover, that the Chinese navy has definitively solved the crucial airborne early‐​warning and battle management problem for its carrier program. Suitable early‐​warning aircraft and even nuclear propulsion may be in development for future aircraft carriers, but it must be agreed that China’s initial sortie into the aircraft carrier realm has hardly altered the naval balance.



For the future of naval combat, however, submarines are likely to be significantly more important than aircraft carriers, because their inherent stealth characteristics afford them much higher survivability. Although China has made steady advances in modernizing its conventional submarine fleet, progress in further developing its nuclear submarine force has been slower than expected. China’s submarine force, therefore, could be quite effective in defensive combat in the East Asian littoral, but it is neither a major deep‐​ocean threat nor a genuine power projection asset. The buildup of China’s modern phased‐​array‐​equipped destroyer force has also been slow—though there are presently signs of acceleration. According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, China had just three Luyang II phasedarray destroyers operational in March 2013, compared with more than 60 Aegis‐​equipped destroyers fielded by the U.S. Navy, plus another 20 Aegis cruisers. For the crucial domain of fixed‐​wing anti‐​submarine aircraft, the U.S. Navy has more than 150 such aircraft against fewer than a dozen equivalent aircraft operated by the PLA Navy.7



The imbalance in nuclear forces is, if anything, even more stark from China’s perspective. Compared with the United States’ nuclear arsenal of approximately 5,000 warheads, China is thought to have just 300 to 400. Moreover, that smaller number is considered to be at a lower alert posture. As an example of the operational implications of that highly significant difference, one may consider the major gap in experience between the U.S. Navy and the PLA Navy with respect to using nuclear‐​armed ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs). The U.S. Navy has been making credible SSBN patrols since the 1960s with ever‐​increasing capabilities (e.g., superior range and stealth). By contrast, the Chinese navy successfully tested a submarine‐​launched ballistic missile only in 1988 and has still never made a single credible deterrent patrol with an SSBN. Accelerating progress in the nuclear weapons realm seems to be a current objective of the Chinese military. For example, Chinese sources reported flight tests of both the new JL-2 submarine‐​launched ballistic missile and the DF-41 truck‐​launched intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) during December 2013.8



It will likely be decades before Chinese nuclear forces could approach the nuclear capabilities wielded by the U.S. armed forces. Arguably, massive nuclear superiority may confer some strategic advantage on Washington in the form of escalation dominance and thus leverage. However, the Rubicon was almost certainly crossed in the past decade with respect to China’s firmly establishing a credible second‐​strike capability, which likely has the effect of diluting the impact of the nuclear balance overall, because it seems clear now that both sides would pay a heavy price were a conflict to reach beyond the nuclear threshold. That posture gives China an ability to threaten some U.S. cities or bases irrespective of U.S. offensive or defensive measures. That capability could be said to exist since the advent of the road‐​mobile DF-31 ICBM. The most recent announcement of a Chinese test of a hypersonic delivery vehicle only further confirms that trend.9



In general, even given the stated imbalances, it would be foolish and simplistic to assume that China poses no challenge whatsoever to American military supremacy. A few examples may serve to illustrate the larger point. Regarding undersea warfare, for example, the Chinese submarine force may not be well suited for global power projection and has comparatively less experience obviously with SSBN operations, but it could be extremely lethal against U.S. and allied ships in and around the East Asian littoral. Indeed, conventional submarines may even have certain advantages in those generally shallow waters. Current Chinese anti‐​ship cruise missiles (ASCMs) likely exceed the capabilities of those in the U.S. Navy’s inventory.10 China’s relatively new Type 2208 fast attack craft, of which more than 65 are said to be in service, may quite easily outduel the new U.S. Navy littoral combat ship, since the latter is not equipped with ASCMs.



Perhaps most threatening to the U.S. Navy is the much‐​discussed alleged development of a Chinese anti‐​ship ballistic missile (ASBM). If such a weapon exists in the Chinese arsenal, designated as the DF-21D, it would pose a very significant threat to the U.S. Navy insofar as the fleet’s current doctrine is built around the carrier battle group, which will likely be vulnerable to an ASBM attack. It would be an analytical mistake to consider the ASBM capability in isolation, especially because the capability is yet to be confirmed by successful tests. It is clear, however, that China’s conventional missile forces are the most formidable in the world and that they could seemingly destroy (or render ineffective) almost all of the U.S. bases proximate to China, including, for example, Kadena Air Base on Okinawa.



Apart from the missile threat, well over 500 fourth‐​generation fighter or attack aircraft are now in the Chinese arsenal. That formidable arsenal suggests that in any conflict in East Asia, the skies would be heavily contested or even dominated by Chinese aircraft—a major change in the strategic balance of power in East Asia. To state the obvious, that change would complicate almost all other U.S. military operations, for example, any attempt to hunt for Chinese submarines with maritime patrol aircraft.11



Thus, Beijing does not need to field a dozen aircraft carrier battle groups or thousands of nuclear weapons to pose major strategic dilemmas for the Pentagon, including the possibility of surprise attack and even defeat. Given those challenges, the somewhat bizarre appellation of “anti‐​access strategy” has evolved among Western strategists to describe Chinese military strategy.12



To sum up, the military picture is one of substantial contradictions. In aggregate forces, the United States generally outstrips China by a wide margin. An all‐​out war, if such a scenario could be imagined in the nuclear age, would certainly witness much greater devastation on the Chinese side. However, the fact that some American cities could survive a nuclear exchange with China would plainly be cold comfort when New York, Los Angeles, Seattle, or Washington (or all four cities) were left as smoking, irradiated holes in the ground. In a nearly all‐​out conflict, but one not crossing the nuclear threshold, the United States again might expect to prevail in a struggle for mastery in the Asia‐​Pacific, but the costs in both lives and resources for both sides would be frightful.



What could be most disturbing, however, is that a host of niche capabilities—whether missiles, drones, submarines, sea mines, or fast attack craft—might enable Beijing to gain victory or fight to a draw in a small‐​to‐​medium (Falklands‐​type) contingency along its flanks, especially if it can convince Washington that further escalation is not in its interest. Indeed, many insightful commentators on the AsiaPacific strategic balance have observed that a certain “asymmetry of interests” may give Beijing leverage in military–diplomatic crises around its periphery. Simply put, that concept suggests that in any given situation of that type, whether over Taiwan or the South China Sea, the stakes will likely be larger for Beijing than for Washington, and China will be more willing to accept losses and thus make credible military threats.



Despite the vitally important strategic quandary now confronting Washington, there is considerable good news from a U.S. perspective in current military developments as well. Most significantly, at present China does not represent a neo‐​Soviet type challenge. A comparison of building rates for submarines, for example, reveals that the Chinese buildup is moderate, not radical.13 Indeed, it seems that Chinese strategists are quite determined not to repeat Soviet strategic follies.14 Moreover, the PLA is notably weak in power projection, for example, with respect to aerial refueling. Its obvious orientation, with its focus on fighters and conventional submarines, is defensive. And defense spending remains well below where it could be. It is worth noting, however, that those tendencies could change if Beijing perceives that its strategic environment has substantially worsened.15



More good news regarding China’s rise may be found in the increasing number of major initiatives undertaken by Beijing to act as a so‐​called responsible stakeholder in upholding global security. Those initiatives include the anti‐​piracy mission in the Gulf of Aden, an ambitious program of training and participation in United Nations’ peacekeeping missions, and also the more limited deployment of the People’s Armed Police to the volatile upper Mekong area to combat instability and rampant smuggling. Indeed, for Chinese specialists on foreign policy and international relations, discussions regarding the provision of public goods (gonggong chanpin) are very much in vogue.16 Those developments highlight the crucial importance of discussing intentions and not just capabilities when determining whether China poses a significant threat to U.S. national security. The ends and means of Chinese foreign and security policy within various complex regional political contexts are surveyed in the next section.



Tensions continue to build in U.S.-China relations. At the outset, the Obama administration seems to have briefly flirted with a “strategic assurance” strategy that might have generated a more stable relationship. That concept was rapidly dropped in favor of more active policies to counter what was perceived as a “more assertive China.” Harvard professor Alastair Iain Johnston demonstrated recently in a comprehensive evaluation of the related episodes that the “assertive China” thesis is bogus, because it is ahistorical, selects on the dependent variable, and has generally arisen because of the phenomenon of blogging and such ill‐​informed sources.17 Moreover, Chinese sources do not appear to support the thesis that Chinese strategists perceive American weakness.18 But in the fall of 2011, the rebalance to Asia was officially unveiled. As part of an action‐​reaction escalation spiral, the many initiatives related to that overall policy have had the predictable effect of further souring U.S.-China relations and of intensifying many points of friction. Given the stabilizing factors that include, above all, the balance of financial terror and the balance of nuclear terror, armed conflict between the superpowers should be an extremely remote possibility. Disturbingly, the action‐​reaction escalation spirals described next, across a wide variety of subregions, suggest that the possibility of war is not as remote as it should be. Let us examine the most dangerous scenarios in turn.



The two Asian giants continue to spar over the uninhabited set of rocks called the Senkaku Islands in Japanese and the Diaoyu Islands in Chinese. After several promising developments in China‐​Japan relations during 2008–2009, the relationship went sour during the September 2010 “trawler incident,” in which a Chinese trawler captain and his crew were detained for supposed reckless behavior at sea. Beijing is alleged to have responded by temporarily halting shipments of rare earths to Japan. In 2012, a new round of escalation began, which has featured risky encounters at sea and also in the air, including most recently a drone deployed by the Chinese side. An article that appeared in the influential weekly newspaper Xuexi Shibao in mid‐​2013 and that examined the U.S.-Japan-China strategic triangle illustrates the Chinese perspective. It sharply criticizes Japan’s behavior as “extremely childish” and likewise asserts that “the U.S. is happy to see certain countries challenge China. These countries serve as American ‘pawns’ in the effort to contain China.” Even as the author calls for greater regional cooperation, he asserts that East Asia has become plagued by the risk of interstate war.19



Tensions remain high in Southeast Asia wherein U.S.-China rivalry seems to be in full bloom. Proponents of the pivot in Washington are lamenting the supposed major blow to American diplomatic interests that occurred when both of China’s top leaders arrived in Southeast Asia for extended visits and related summitry in October 2013, while the U.S. president canceled planned visits to the region because of a major budget showdown with Congress. Those same “rebalancers” could take succor in knowing that U.S. diplomacy has succeeded in “flipping” Myanmar during 2011–2012, thus greatly complicating China‐​Myanmar relations.20 However, such zero‐​sum games have threatened to get out of hand, especially with regard to the various contested maritime features of the South China Sea. A writer in the normally cautious PLA Navy magazine intoned: “We in China cannot have restraint without any limits. If Vietnam believes that it can treat Chinese forbearance like so much salt in the South China Sea with its penchant to say anything, then Hanoi has indeed made a strategic error in judgment.”21 During the summer of 2011, there seemed to be an elevated risk of war between Vietnam and China.



During 2012–2013, ships from the Philippines and China regularly tangled in the vicinity of Scarborough Reef, or Huangyan Island. Some retired Chinese flag officers are apparently eager to “yi luan ji shi” (break an egg with a stone) when it comes to the maritime dispute with Manila.22 The fact that the U.S. Navy has been regularly deploying its most advanced nuclear attack submarines to the Philippines may indicate that Washington considers a clash to be a disquieting possibility. 2014 has witnessed a new crisis in China‐​Vietnam relations as Vietnam sought to directly challenge oil and gas exploration in the vicinity of the Paracel Islands in the South China Sea.



The primary danger in a Korean conflict is not of a direct U.S.-China clash of arms. However, there is a substantial danger that a failure by Washington and Beijing to cooperate effectively in those most challenging circumstances could precipitate a further nuclear buildup by Pyongyang or could even fail to stop a catastrophic—possibly nuclear—inter-Korean conflict. There is no doubt that after North Korea’s third nuclear test in February 2013, many Chinese experts are pressing to reform their relationship with North Korea.23 And yet, the lack of trust between Beijing and Washington may inhibit any coordinated approach to the ongoing nuclear crisis on the peninsula.24



The finger‐​pointing in U.S.-China relations in the aftermath of the sinking of the South Korean corvette Cheonan in March 2010 seems to have been a major factor in the development of the Obama administration’s harder line in the region, especially after Beijing seemed to warn against major U.S. military exercises in the Yellow Sea in mid‐​2010. Such tensions are indicative of sloppy diplomacy on both sides; regrettably, U.S.-China cooperation regarding the Korean Peninsula is not much improved since that time. A not insignificant problem is the tendency on both sides to view the Korean Peninsula in zero‐​sum terms.25 In that most deleterious conceptual framework, interests in both Beijing and Washington seek to prolong the terrifying stalemate and brinkmanship for fear that the other will achieve inordinate relative gains. Thus, the Chinese are generally anxious about a unified peninsula in which the U.S. alliance with the Republic of Korea extends right up to the Chinese border, while the Americans are fearful lest China’s charms cause Seoul to question the value of the ROK-U.S. alliance. Those fears reflect excessive paranoia and distract from the shared purpose of achieving the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Regarding the problem of U.S. force structure on the peninsula, a recent study by a RAND Corporation analyst concludes that up to a quarter million U.S. ground troops could be required for a Korean contingency, but coordination with Beijing could obviate the need for such forces.26



After an era of relative quiet in Sino‐​Indian relations since rapprochement occurred in the 1980s, rivalry has now begun to develop with renewed vigor. Tense confrontations are occurring between Indian and Chinese forces both at sea and along the disputed mountain border.27 Undoubtedly, India’s stark defeat in the 1962 border war with China leaves a history of enmity in the relationship that feeds further rivalry. Still, many American strategists see opportunity in that rivalry, whether to sell arms to New Delhi or to distract Beijing. A recent analysis of American interests in the rivalry concludes that Washington should not encourage maritime rivalry in the Indian Ocean, which might just fuel China’s desire to build a superpower‐​type navy, but rather it should foster rivalry on the mountain border—the better to convince Beijing that it must invest further in land power vice naval power. At this point, one can only speculate on the reactions of Indian strategists to that less than subtle approach of being used to keep China’s rise in a box. Indeed, there can be little doubt that Chinese strategists now perceive a major threat from Washington’s efforts to build up its defense relationship with New Delhi.28



The Taiwan scenario has generally been out of the headlines, and that is a positive development for both U.S.-China relations and U.S. national security. It is no exaggeration to say that peace has been breaking out across the Taiwan Strait. For 2012, it was projected that 2.3 million tourists would visit Taiwan from the Chinese mainland—an almost eightfold increase from 2008.29 Some innovative proposals have emerged for reforming Taiwan’s status in U.S. foreign policy to take advantage of the warming in cross‐​strait ties.30 Some restraint in arms sales to Taiwan may be discernible in Obama administration policy, but the official line is that the arms sales are crucial to maintaining cross‐​strait peace and stability.31



Meanwhile, Beijing continues to be extremely suspicious of U.S. motives regarding the Taiwan issue. For example, a mainland analysis asserts that the Obama administration has shifted, in accordance with the “rebalance to Asia,” from “countering independence” to “countering unification.”32 What is essential to realize regarding the Taiwan scenario, which was by far the most dangerous scenario for East Asian security during 1996–2008, is that positive developments across the strait should be the building blocks of a larger U.S.-China strategic partnership. Instead, the tendency to forget about Taiwan in Washington amounts to a troubling phenomenon of what Professor Johnston calls “selecting on the dependent variable.”33 In other words, if China’s actions are peaceful and constructive on the difficult cross‐​strait issue, then the focus turns elsewhere, for example, to the East China Sea and South China Sea. But then, it is obvious that rivalry sells more than peace and interdependence.



The examples provided reveal troubling tendencies toward U.S.-China military rivalry across a wide variety of circumstances. However, the development of U.S.-China rivalry is not limited geographically to East and South Asia. A recent scholarly study of mineral exploitation in southern Africa in mid‐​2013, for example, finds, “Given the rising levels of Chinese demand for resources … the probability exists of friction and eventual conflict between China and the United States.”34 American officials have reportedly expressed serious concerns about Turkey’s major, prospective purchase of air defense systems from China.35 Major tensions have also arisen over various functional areas of future warfare, whether cyberwarfare or other new and potentially destabilizing weapons systems, such as the U.S. concept of “prompt global strike”—a significant concern among Chinese military strategists.36



As noted at length, tensions in the Asia‐​Pacific have been growing steadily since about 2009 with the noteworthy exception of the Taiwan Strait. Pinpointing the cause of that increasing tension is difficult, to say the least. The tensions, moreover, may well be attributable to certain factors completely outside of U.S.-China relations, for example, the election of conservative South Korean President Lee Myung‐​bak and leadership transition in North Korea, or alternatively the submission of the joint Vietnamese‐​Malaysian statement on the limits of their respective claims in the South China Sea to the United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf.37 Still, there was a widely held belief in Washington that China had become more assertive in 2008–2009, because of perceived U.S. weakness owing to the financial crisis and also a concomitant rise in China’s self‐​confidence. As previously suggested, recent scholarship has called into question that pervasive conventional wisdom.38 Moreover, the argument can be made that the positive trends in the difficult Taiwan situation should logically outweigh wrangling over rocks and reefs. However, it is quite clear that such notions were held by the key decisionmakers in the Obama administration.39 Out of that perception, it seems, the pivot or rebalancing to the Asia‐​Pacific was born.



The Obama administration’s policy of rebalancing—the single most important proactive foreign policy initiative undertaken by the administration—envisioned at least three key elements: diplomatic, military, and economic, with an emphasis on the latter. In theory, the primary driver of the rebalancing is the economic dynamism of Asia‐​Pacific economies, and the primary mechanism for realizing the rebalance is, therefore, the Trans‐​Pacific Partnership trade agreement. But in practice, economic factors seem to take a distinct back seat to diplomatic and especially military considerations.



There is insufficient space in this chapter to present a full critique of the Obama administration’s rebalance to the Asia‐​Pacific. Much of the criticism of the present policy is that it is not vigorous enough— nice words, but too little action or military muscle to back them up. That is not the approach taken here; quite to the contrary. Robert Ross succinctly described the policy’s shortcomings in Foreign Affairs in late 2012: “The new U.S. policy unnecessarily compounds Beijing’s insecurities and will only feed China’s aggressiveness, undermine regional stability, and decrease the possibility of cooperation between Beijing and Washington.” Ross asserts that Washington has turned to “costly initiatives whose force is disproportionate to the threat from China,” and he squarely blames former secretary of state Hillary Clinton’s clumsy diplomacy in Southeast Asia during mid‐​2010. He concludes quite ominously, “The outbreak of hostilities in the region will become a real possibility, as China pushes back.”40 Undoubtedly, the most significant danger of the rebalance is that it increases the risks of superpower military conflict over issues of trivial importance—myriad and rather insignificant “rocks” in the seas surrounding China.



A few other critiques of the present policy should be noted, including the drain on U.S. resources during an era of austerity and the inappropriate influence in Washington of other states and their various and sundry parochial interests. In addition, there is the misconception that American credibility and the global balance of power are both at stake in those sensitive disputes over maritime claims. In fact, the global balance of power is not remotely likely to swing against the United States given its fundamental military strength, and the fact that American friends and partners are unlikely to bandwagon against the United States under any circumstances. Perversely, American credibility is always under threat because Washington is so reluctant to make hard choices and to establish limits to U.S. security guarantees. If alliances were interpreted in a clearly defensive manner (e.g., defense of home islands), issues of credibility would not arise, U.S. credibility would actually be strengthened, and defense requirements would be clarified. Those defense requirements will be discussed briefly in the next section of this chapter.



If the current policy of rebalancing to the Asia‐​Pacific is both poorly conceived and poorly executed, what are the alternatives for reform? An obvious start is to rebalance the rebalance by prioritizing engagement (and especially military cooperation) with Beijing. Some preliminary evidence indicates that has now begun to occur, in part to limit the damage and risk that have already resulted from the overheating U.S.-China rivalry. A more responsible course for both U.S.-China relations and global order would not seek to avoid multipolarity but would embrace it. At the core of a functioning multipolarity—which would involve rising powers such as Brazil and India working together with risen powers, including Russia, Japan, and especially Europe—would be an effective “G-2 partnership” between Beijing and Washington. Such a partnership is unworkable at present, given numerous conflicting interests and clashing political ideologies, not to mention a gaping trust deficit.



To bridge that gap and form a strong foundation for partnership, the imperative is not for more dialogues, photo ops, and cocktail parties.



On the contrary, what is required is hard‐​headed bargaining that leads to compromise on some of the thorniest issues. Such compromises will serve U.S. national security interests by strictly limiting the costs and risks for the United States in an era of tremendous and somewhat dangerous flux in Asian politics. The process of a compromise or a grand bargain could take a variety of forms, but a few aspects are suggested here to illustrate the broad range of issues that would benefit from mutual accommodation. If the United States were to reform its Taiwan policy, could China also reform its policies with respect to nuclear proliferators (e.g., North Korea)? If China were to limit its development of the antiship ballistic missile and threatening space weaponry, could the United States halt development of Prompt Global Strike? If the United States were to decrease surveillance activities proximate to China’s coast, could China radically increase military transparency? If China were to accept a midpoint division for the demarcation of the East China Sea, could the United States push Japan to accept that the Senkaku/​Diaoyu islets are in dispute and to enter into negotiations? If the United States were to support bilateral “joint development” negotiations to resolve the contested claims in the South China Sea, could China redefine its U‐​shaped line claim to conform with the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea? Many more such compromises could be envisioned.



For those who think that the climate‐​change issue could outweigh in significance the disposition of tiny rocks and reefs thousands of miles from American shores, one could even consider American acceptance of using per capita emissions for setting country totals in return for a Chinese acceptance of the need for intrusive verification as part of any global climate‐​change treaty. Compromise is a bad word in Washington and may be even more so at Foggy Bottom, at least until recently. However, good diplomacy consists of much more than information operations or preparation of the battle space. Indeed, compromise will be the only way to work constructively with China in the emerging multipolar world.



U.S. defense policy has long suffered from overly ambitious goals. In the 20th century, the armed forces strayed far from the principles first laid down wisely by the country’s Founders. Those principles warned against both foreign entanglements and colossal military establishments that formed a drain on resources and an inappropriate influence on the nation’s policy. Arguably, the triple threat posed by the Soviet Union’s battle‐​hardened legions in the heart of Europe, Moscow’s development of nuclear weaponry, and the specter of hungry and desperate masses (including in China) across the globe turning to the Kremlin for leadership did perhaps warrant a massive military buildup, at least for a time. But already in the 1950s, President Dwight Eisenhower raised major concerns about the unseemly power of the military industrial complex and the threat posed by militarization to the American way of life. Despite his prescient warning, it is clear that during the Cold War the U.S. defense and intelligence establishment overreached more than a few times.



An unfortunate byproduct of the rapid demise of the Soviet Union in 1991, however, was that that victory in the Cold War provided a new and hallowed template for U.S. national security policy. Since that time, Washington has bestrode the world like a drunken sailor, searching for any opportunity to wield fists, taking a bloody nose and black eye here and there, while occasionally getting knocked to the ground. However, as the euphoria of the unipolar moment passes into the history books, it is imperative that the sailor undertakes more sober and prudent policies in order to forestall a looming disaster for U.S. national security.



Factions and interests on both the right and the left are now disturbingly united in an effort to cast China as the next multidimensional threat to the U.S.—on par with or even exceeding that of the Soviet Union in its dimensions. Many of those interests, moreover, are poised to profit from such a characterization. A few obvious facts, however, are worth repeating when considering the putative threat posed by China to U.S. national security: China has not resorted to any significant use of force in more than three decades, it has no foreign bases, and it remains rather weak (compared with U.S. forces) in the domains of power projection and nuclear war fighting. In the coming decades, all of those metrics may reverse, and China could morph from a bungling, paranoid panda into a fire‐​breathing, goose‐​stepping dragon. It seems likely that Beijing will have the requisite resources, bureaucratic discipline, and talent to make such a transition. Moreover, it is not short of strategists advocating for more aggressive steps to counter the United States.41 Washington’s overall goal should be to forestall that metamorphosis, in part by acknowledging China’s security concerns and by seeking compromises on the many issues that divide the United States and China, as outlined in the previous section. It is worth reiterating that Beijing is planning neither to attack the United States nor to conquer East Asia. Rather, its foreign policy behavior has, by and large, comported itself well with current international norms—in rather stark contrast to Moscow’s much more confrontational approach toward the West.



Strategy involves tough choices. The United States simply cannot defend to the maximum extent against all possible threats. The preceding analysis implies that some significant reductions in U.S. defense outlays are quite feasible. The most obvious place to cut involves the ground forces, which is presently occurring in light of the belated ending of counterinsurgency conflicts in Iraq and now Afghanistan.42 Indeed, a cynical interpretation of the pivot is that it is designed to focus and preserve the bulk of Defense Department spending even as that painful drawdown occurs. But major cuts can also be made to the other services. The U.S. Marines have gotten approval to return to beloved Australia, but it is hard to imagine how their still extensive presence in Okinawa could be useful in any of a range of contingencies, with the noteworthy exception of disaster relief operations as undertaken, for example, in the Philippines recently. The U.S. Air Force should scrap its costly dreams of a next‐​generation manned bomber. In the era of longrange precision strike, it is simply not clear that air bases can be defended. Navy carrier forces should also be substantially cut to perhaps six total vessels or fewer. They are too vulnerable and too costly to operate further as the fleet’s capital ships. Other major problems with the composition of the surface fleet are suggested by a littoral combat ship that lacks anti‐​ship cruise missiles and a next‐​generation destroyer built around a long‐​range gun optimized for shore bombardment. Nuclear forces can also be pared down much further. None of those capabilities are crucial, and most are hardly relevant to hedging against China. If those capabilities can be reduced, the resultant savings can be channeled to much more pressing priorities, whether homeland security or better schools.



One of the most serious problems with current Pentagon thinking is the inability to understand the concept of a hedge. A hedge is, almost by definition, not the main effort. It is a narrow and purposeful, secondary or tertiary effort to cope with the risk of a very low probability event. Some capabilities are useful for hedging against a U.S.-China conflict. A particularly suitable capability in that regard is the nuclear attack submarine force. At over $2 billion per boat, the vessels are not cheap, but they are useful for at least three reasons: (a) they are highly survivable given China’s weak anti‐​submarine capability; (b) they could be useful in applying military pressure against China’s merchant or naval fleets if the need arises in the intermediate range of escalation; and (c) they could also be employed effectively in the most intense war‐​fighting scenarios up to and including conventional mainland strikes and nuclear warfare. Approaching a low level of 40 boats in the 2020 time frame is not especially prudent. Rather, a fleet of nuclear attack boats of at least 80 vessels would form the most effective force to hedge against China’s rise. Although that number of vessels seems high, it would merely be taking account of the general transition from vulnerable surface forces to much less vulnerable subsurface forces as the fleet’s backbone. Eighty or more boats would be needed to account for the fact that submarines are highly complex systems that are difficult and slow to build, that require frequent maintenance, that are not completely invulnerable even at present, and that do not have large magazines. Furthermore, the Chinese navy may improve its anti‐​submarine warfare proficiency, and U.S. submarine bases could be targets for preemptive attack. Another pricey weapons system that could play a role in the hedge is the F-35 vertical takeoff variant. Such a capability, allowing for substantial stealth and dispersal, could be essential to the street‐​fighter aspect of future warfare in which there is no guarantee that any given air base would survive the first few hours of combat.



If hedging against China is not the main effort of U.S. defense policy in coming decades, then what should be the focus of the main effort in national security? It should be on integrating the U.S. armed forces into a multipolar system that has some capability to form coalitions to respond to the most dire, regional contingencies. Paramount in that integration process should be robust cooperation with the Chinese armed forces in all of the following areas: crisis management, search and rescue, disaster relief, environmental enforcement and mitigation, sea‐​lane security, counterterrorism, and even counterproliferation. Such activities should also be carried out on a bilateral and multilateral basis with other major powers, such as Brazil, India, Japan, and so forth. But the security relationship with China should not be neglected because it is problematic. To the contrary, because it is extremely difficult, that relationship deserves to be prioritized.



Recent events have shed greater light on the emerging multipolar world order. The Obama administration sensibly walked back from the brink on the question of war with Syria. With respect to the emergent Ukraine crisis, the use of force and the specter of a clash of arms between the United States and Russia have generally not been under serious consideration, thankfully. Hawks in Washington will undoubtedly attribute the Kremlin’s aggressive behavior to an alleged failure of leadership and a general lack of toughness by the Obama administration. But a more sophisticated analysis of the Ukraine situation reveals that American power and influence are finite, and there is little opportunity to affect that complex situation positively.



An analogy to the difficult situations along China’s flanks turns out to be instructive. Although Beijing is not on the verge of annexing large parts of neighboring states, Chinese strategists have repeatedly suggested their admiration for Moscow’s boldness. Certainly, some of the same dynamics with regard to historical grudges—anger at Washington’s predilection for interfering and a sense of great power prerogatives—are also at work. American diplomats would be wise to be a little less concerned with those episodes in the areas immediately proximate to China (as well as Russia). American leaders would likewise do well to spend more time thinking about domestic quandaries rather than obsessing about the integrity of various alliances or about the possibility of minor clashes over contested rocks brought on at least in part by the narcissism and parochial interests of regional states.



Renewed and reinvigorated American focus on domestic challenges is not the whole solution to developing more stable and productive U.S.-China relations, however. As outlined herein, the hardest part of achieving a modus vivendi with China will involve difficult compromises and concrete agreements that are not popular in either Washington or Beijing. An American withdrawal from the region altogether is hardly desirable and not what China seeks. But a key plank of more cautious and restrained policies in the Asia‐​Pacific would require from American leaders the courage to declare that islets are no more than “rocks” and hence not worth a drop of American blood. Developments, such as the current controversy over the Chinese Air Defense Identification Zone, need to be described merely as the teapot tempests that they are. Contrary to prevailing conventional wisdom, therefore, U.S. forces in the region can safely be reduced, U.S. security commitments could be substantially narrowed, and alliance relationships could be reformed in a way that brings U.S. strategy, interests, and capabilities into closer alignment and hence upholds our genuine national security interests.

12 The term is bizarre because it does not draw on any explicit Chinese formulation of military strategy or doctrine. “Access” is taken to be a universal good, but if that involved Chinese access into the eastern Pacific and proximate to U.S. shores and bases, then U.S. strategy for preventing such “access” could be termed an anti-access strategy. In that sense, all military strategy is “anti-access” in that it seeks to constrain the movement or striking power of the adversary. Therefore, not only does the term have built-in subjective bias, but also, in the end, it is rather tautological.

As many readers know, the popularity of WUWT has caused some angst and envy in alarmist circles. As a result, I have a collection of hangers on, fake named wannabees, and Internet stalkers. I wear the effort of these clowns  as a badge of honor, in addition to the entertainment they provide.
Most of these people are angry and often incompetent  trolls that have been booted off WUWT and other websites because they just don’t play well with others. They serve as prime examples as the sort of ridiculously hateful rhetoric that permeates the alarmist side of the debate. They are all long on emotion and denigration, and short on sensibility.
As an example, Andrew K. aka “poptech” says he was being harassed by one of my blog spawn. Some people just need to learn to pick their battles, and Andrew was not amused. This is the result: The Truth about What’sUpWithThatWatts, et al.

I generally admire the work of Roger Pielke Jr., a political scientist in the University of Colorado-Boulder's Center for Science and Technology Policy Research. His new book on climate change is refreshingly honest and non-ideological, if a bit overly technophilic. His broader work offers the important insight that science alone cannot direct public policy, but rather it can only lay out possible results of different policy choices.   
  
Given the quality of his work, I was disappointed by Pielke's op-ed in today's _NYT_ defending Congress's legislated obsolescence of the incandescent light bulb. He argues that government standard-setting is an important contribution to human welfare, and the light bulb standard is just part of that standard-setting (though he does suggest some minor policy tweaks to allow limited future availability of incandescents).   
  
To justify his argument, Pielke points out the great benefit of government-established standard measures, as well as quality standards: 



Indeed, [in the United States of the late 19th century] the lack of standards for everything from weights and measures to electricity — even the gallon, for example, had eight definitions — threatened to overwhelm industry and consumers with a confusing array of incompatible choices.   
  
This wasn’t the case everywhere. Germany’s standards agency, established in 1887, was busy setting rules for everything from the content of dyes to the process for making porcelain; other European countries soon followed suit. Higher-quality products, in turn, helped the growth in Germany’s trade exceed that of the United States in the 1890s.   
  
America finally got its act together in 1894, when Congress standardized the meaning of what are today common scientific measures, including the ohm, the volt, the watt and the henry, in line with international metrics. And, in 1901, the United States became the last major economic power to establish an agency to set technological standards.



Alas, this argument **doesn't** support Pielke's light bulb standard.   




The weights-and-measures and product standards that he cites are examples of government response to market failures—instances where private action is unable to reach efficient results. Concerning weights and measures, a type of market failure known as the collective action problem can make it difficult to establish standard measures privately. Getting everyone to agree can be like herding cats, and there is ample incentive to secretly defect from that standard — e.g., a gas station would love to sell you a 120-ounce ""gallon"" that you assume is a standard 128 ounces. (OTOH, there are plenty of examples of private action overcoming this problem, such as the standardization of railroad track gauges in the late 19th century.) Likewise, quality standards can be understood as a response to a kind of market failure known as the information asymmetry problem— e.g., a producer of low-quality goods may knowingly try to pass them off as high-quality goods. (Again, there are plenty of examples of private action overcoming this problem.)   
  
As libertarians, we recognize that there are market failures, and that government can sometimes mitigate them. (That's why we're not anarchists.) Also as libertarians, we recognize that government intervention can result in outcomes even less efficient than the original market failure. (That's why we're not run-of-the-mill Democrats or Republicans.)   
  
But where is the market failure with incandescent bulbs? After nearly 125 years of use, people know the drawbacks and advantages of incandescents—that they use more electricity than other types of bulbs and have a shorter lifespan, but they cost very little and work much better in certain applications—from dimmer switches to Easy-Bake Ovens—than other bulbs. Besides, CFL bulbs were widely available before Congress's 2007 legislation, and LED lights were already in the R&D pipeline.   
  
Perhaps Pielke would argue that there is a market failure with incandescents: the negative externality of air pollution, including greenhouse gas emissions. But incandescent lighting is only one of many, many electricity-using devices, and electricity generation is just one of many, many sources of air pollution. So why the focus on just this one externality source instead of advocating a policy that broadly addresses emissions? And why devote his op-ed to discussing technology standards, and make no mention of air pollution?

"**Several protesters have been arrested while trying to run from a Hong Kong university campus surrounded by police.**
Around 100 people tried to leave the Polytechnic University, but were met with tear gas and rubber bullets.
In the past week, the campus has turned into a battleground as long-running anti-government protests become more violent.
A small number managed to successfully leave the campus using rope ladders before being picked up by motorcycles.
Hong Kong's Hospital Authority says 116 people have been injured and taken to hospital.
The violence is some of the worst seen during months of unrest in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory. The protests started over a controversial extradition bill, and have now evolved into broader anti-government demonstrations.
China has warned that ""no-one should underestimate [its] will to safeguard its sovereignty and Hong Kong's stability"", and its ambassador to the UK said the central government would not sit back and watch if the situation became ""uncontrollable"".
Hong Kong is a part of China, and the protests are, in part, about the fear that the special freedoms the territory enjoys as a former British colony are being eroded.
Earlier, Hong Kong's High Court ruled that a ban on protesters wearing face masks was unconstitutional. The colonial-era emergency law was invoked in October, but protesters largely defied it.
Hong Kong's government said the weekend's events had ""reduced the chance"" of district elections being held on Sunday as planned, public broadcaster RTHK reports. Postponing or cancelling the vote could further inflame the protests.
The UK has urged an ""end to the violence and for all sides to engage in meaningful political dialogue"" ahead of the elections.
Police are still besieging the university where several hundred protesters are thought to be trapped. Officers have ordered those inside to drop their weapons and surrender.
A protester inside the university told the BBC supplies, including first aid equipment, were running low.
Meanwhile, a fire broke out on campus and loud explosions were heard, according to the South China Morning Post.
PolyU has been occupied by protesters for several days. On Sunday night, police warned protesters they had until 22:00 (14:00 GMT) to leave the campus, saying they could use live ammunition if the attacks continued.
On Sunday, the university said it had been ""severely and extensively vandalised"".
A number of protesters left inside in the university have identified themselves as current students in media interviews but it is unclear exactly how many of them are, in fact, university students.
**By Grace Tsoi** **, BBC** **News, Hong Kong**
Worried parents whose children were trapped inside the Polytechnic University were among the 200 protesters who joined a peaceful rally on Monday night in eastern Tsim Sha Tsui, a tourist area which is only 300 metres away from the besieged campus.
Ms Ng - who only wanted to be identified by her last name - found out on Sunday night her son was among those trapped inside. ""He's frightened because he has not faced any emergency situation on his own. She has been on the streets near the university since then.
The teary-eyed mother is proud of her 18-year-old son despite the circumstances. ""My son didn't cry. He's strong and likes to help others,"" she said. ""I told my son that you did nothing wrong and you are an outstanding kid. I wouldn't blame you.""
She told him to stay inside the campus and wait for her to pick him up. Ms Ng said the government should bear the responsibility for the chaos in Hong Kong.
""Our government is more and more reckless. It ignores the very lowly demands from the citizens!"" she said. ""I wasn't born in Hong Kong but I love Hong Kong so much! Hong Kong is a wonderful place but it has turned into such a state. It breaks my heart!""
Campuses remained relatively free of violence during the Hong Kong protests but, last week, the Chinese University of Hong Kong became a battleground.
Police say protesters threw petrol bombs on a major road near the university in an effort to stop traffic. Officers attempted to reclaim the road, leading to major clashes.
The university then cancelled all classes for the rest of the term. Days later, protesters at PolyU also tried to block access to a key tunnel near the university.
Protests have also been held at other locations in Hong Kong.
Hong Kong - a British colony until 1997 - is part of China under a model known as ""one country, two systems"". Under this model, it has a high degree of autonomy and people have freedoms unseen in mainland China.
The protests started in June after the government planned to pass a bill that would allow suspects to be extradited to mainland China. Many feared this would undermine the city's freedoms and judicial independence.
The bill was eventually withdrawn, but the demonstrations continued, having evolved into a broader protest movement against alleged police brutality, and the way Hong Kong is administered by Beijing."

Guest Post by Willis Eschenbach
After a very long night, with a ten-hour flight somewhere in the middle, I blew into Fiji at about five in the morning.
I was reminded during my trip of the old story about the guy who decided to leave the ocean behind. He said he was going to put an anchor on his shoulder and walk inland until someone asked him what kind of crop you use that funny-looking plow on, and that’s where he’d settle … the trip was relatively uneventful, except for the part where I had to convince the TSA folks that a sextant is not a weapon of mass destruction. Someone watching asked if they could take a picture of the sextant, said they’d never seen one and figured they’d never see another one.
I grabbed a cab to Vuda Point Marina. Since it is in Fiji, the “d” is pronounced “nd”, so it’s actually called “Vunda Point”. I found the  boat, but there was no one there, so I just took a photo of the boat and kicked back to watch the world go by.
I wasn’t waiting, you understand. I gave up waiting not long after I first moved to the South Pacific. I was in a traffic jam riding a bus in Suva. I looked around. All the expatriates in their cars were all sitting and obviously fuming, waiting for the jam to clear. The Fijians, on the other hand, were leaning out their windows and talking to people on the streets, or in discussions with people in their cars … but none of the Fijians were waiting. I realized that waiting is a state of mind where the future is the only subject, and all it does is make me crabby … so instead, I walked around and looked at the ships up on the hard. Ships out of water are like naked people, all of their faults and strengths are on display.
After while, one of the crew woke up on the boat, and we went to the cabin where my mad mate Mike is staying. The boys on the boat said there was nothing for us to do for a couple of days, so Mike decided to roll with me to Pacific Harbour, where I had some business to transact and some friends to catch up with. It’s been six years since I’ve gone to Fiji, so I wanted to see the guys that Mike calls “The Dogs of Winter”. The sobriquet refers to the fact that most of them spend their summers in the US making money, which lets them spend their winters in Fiji …
As you might imagine, almost all of my Fiji friends are surfers like myself. Mike and I showed up on their hill unannounced, where the jungle argues with the ocean …I had to break the sad news to them that I didn’t have time for a surf trip this go-round, but that I’d be back in February. Here’s why. There are lots of small breaks alongshore, but our main big-wave spot is called “Frigates Passage”. It’s on the far eastern end of the barrier reef that surrounds Beqa Island (pronounced “Mbengga”, it’s Fiji), about 17 miles (30 km) offshore of the main island of Viti Levu. It’s a magic spot out in the middle of the ocean, full of life, and it will hold a good-sized wave.

A few years ago, I went to Fiji in order to surf Frigates on my 60th birthday … and at the time, I swore a big swear that I would come back and surf Frigates on my 70th birthday, which is this coming February. So I was able to fend of their importuning me to stick around and surf by saying that a) I’m leaving Fiji in a couple days, no time and b) I’ll be back to surf Frigates in about ten months.
I asked them about whether the current coral reef bleaching episode affected Frigates, and they confirmed my own experience. A few years back, there was bleaching in Kadavu, one of the outer islands of Fiji. I dove there about a year later, and the reef was well on its way back to recovery.
The Dogs told me that they’d been out surfing Frigates almost every day, both before and after the bleaching. They said the water got hotter and hotter, and as it did, the reef got brighter and brighter and full of life. But then as the temperatures continued to rise, literally overnight the reef turned white—one day full color and radiant, the next day white.
But now, they said, a couple of months have passed and the reef is already recolonizing. They can see the new polyps. I said this was because they don’t have to build the structure of the reef, that’s the white skeleton that remains after bleaching. It’s the perfect home for coral polyps, which settle down out of the water when they find such a spot and set up housekeeping. since they don’t have to build a new skeleton, they start flourishing right away and in a surprisingly short time, the reef is back in business. People think coral bleaching is the death of the reef, but nothing could be further from the truth. All that happens is that a species of coral polyps which is more heat-tolerant will colonize the homesites, and the life of the reef will continue.
Anyhow, Eric and Geeta were having a potluck barbecue, so naturally the Dogs rounded me and Mike up and took us to the BBQ. There, we had one of Geeta’s famous Indian dinners that she learned to make from her mom, full of tomato chutney and rotis and whatever else. My great thanks for their hospitality to wandering miscreants and minstrels …
Paul and Shiloh and Ryan all brought their guitars, so we set up in the living room and I played some with them. I sang:
""If you're nobody's business or you're front-page news

Folk, rock, country, or Delta blues

Tell your truth however you choose

And do it all for the sake of the song.

Well, it's hitchhike, bus ride, or rental car

Living rooms, coffee houses, rundown bars

Ten thousand people, or alone under the stars,

It's all for the sake of the song ...""
That’s about all of the news that’s fit to print. The usual diurnal tropical cycle is going on here, clear in the morning, clouding up in the afternoon …
Now, it’s about 5 PM. A few minutes ago it got that hot, sticky feeling that presages a thunderstorm, and now the rain has come to cool the surface. The weather is working exactly as it should and as it has for millions of years. The sky is blue between the clouds, the ocean is bluer yet, so all I can say is, keep singing, dear friends, it is definitely all for the sake of the song …

"**Anti-government protests have rocked Hong Kong for months and the situation shows no sign of dying down.**
Here's all the background you need to know in 100 or 500 words - you can read each individually or in turn.
Hong Kong's protests started in June against plans to allow extradition to mainland China.
Critics feared this could undermine judicial independence and endanger dissidents.
Until 1997, Hong Kong was ruled by Britain as a colony but then returned to China. Under the ""one country, two systems"" arrangement, it has some autonomy, and its people more rights.
The bill was withdrawn in September but demonstrations continue and now demand full democracy and an inquiry into police actions.
Clashes between police and activists have become increasingly violent, with police firing live bullets and protesters attacking officers and throwing petrol bombs.
The extradition bill which triggered the first protest was introduced in April. It would have allowed for criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China under certain circumstances.
Opponents said this risked exposing Hongkongers to unfair trials and violent treatment. They also argued the bill would give China greater influence over Hong Kong and could be used to target activists and journalists.
Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets. After weeks of protests, leader Carrie Lam eventually said the bill would be suspended indefinitely.
Protesters feared the bill could be revived, so demonstrations continued, calling for it to be withdrawn completely.
By then clashes between police and protesters had become more frequent and violent.
In September, the bill was finally withdrawn, but protesters said this was ""too little, too late"".
On 1 October, while China was celebrating 70 years of Communist Party rule, Hong Kong experienced one of its most ""violent and chaotic days"".
An 18-year-old was shot in the chest with a live bullet as protesters fought officers with poles, petrol bombs and other projectiles.
The government then banned protesters wearing face masks, and in early November a pro-Beijing lawmaker was stabbed in the street by a man pretending to be a supporter.
One week later, a policeman shot one protester at close range when activists were trying to set up a road block. Later that day another man was set on fire by anti-government protesters.
In November, a standoff between police and students barricaded on the campus of Hong Kong's Polytechnic University became another defining moment.
Later that month, the territory held local council elections that were seen as a barometer of public opinion.
The vote saw a landslide victory for the pro-democracy movement, with 17 of the 18 councils now controlled by pro-democracy councillors.
Some protesters have adopted the motto: ""Five demands, not one less!"" These are:
The fifth demand, the withdrawal of the bill, has already been met.
Protests supporting the Hong Kong movement have spread across the globe, with rallies taking place in the UK, France, US, Canada and Australia.
In many cases, people supporting the demonstrators were confronted by pro-Beijing rallies.
Chinese president Xi Jinping has warned against separatism, saying any attempt to divide China would end in ""bodies smashed and bones ground to powder"".
Hong Kong is a former British colony handed back to China in 1997.
It has its own judiciary and a separate legal system from mainland China. Those rights include freedom of assembly and freedom of speech.
But those freedoms - the Basic Law - expire in 2047 and it is not clear what Hong Kong's status will then be.

"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the  .) JoAnna Klein, a science writer, brings us today’s introduction. Earlier this month, the scientific journal Conservation Biology published a study that found that nearly half of the fish sampled at roughly 10 percent of Los Angeles sushi restaurants were not what they were purported to be on menus. In many cases fish were substituted with cheaper, more environmentally sustainable catches. But in some instances, replacement fish were actually endangered or threatened. Halibut and red snapper were found to be the most frequently misidentified. Between 2012 and 2014, researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles and Loyola Marymount University sent their students to 26 Los Angeles restaurants with various price points and high ratings on Yelp and Zagat. Their mission was simple: Order dishes containing each of nine targeted fish that are common on menus and often mislabeled confirm with the restaurant that the fish was what the menu said it was collect a piece of sushi about the size of a kernel of corn drop it in a labeled jar of ethanol and take it back to the lab for DNA analysis. Knowing rates of mislabeled fish is important, the authors say, because it threatens consumer health. It also threatens a marine ecosystem and the billion dollar fishing industry that depends on it. But studies in the past have been inconsistent in terms of seafood mislabeling rates. “We wanted to see why there is that huge level of variation,” said Demian Willette, a biologist who helped lead the study. So they did the same thing at the same place each year for four years. The students collected more than 350 samples over all. In every restaurant, there was at least one case of mislabeled fish. But the researchers say you can’t blame the restaurant in every case. Like their diners, and even their grocers, the restaurants were most likely victims of fish fraud. For consumers going forward, Mr. Willette suggested asking your waiter directly what you’re ordering. The Monterey Bay Aquarium’s Seafood Watch also offers resources and a phone app to help  .

Recently declassified documents on the USS Independence freely available online in the Journal of Maritime Archaeology
The newly declassified images show the World War II aircraft carrier which was one of nearly a hundred ships used as targets in the first tests of the atomic bomb at Bikini Atoll in 1946. Here, Sailors watch the ‘Able Test’ burst miles out to sea from the deck of the support ship USS Fall River on 1 July 1946. Image: Naval Archives
The April issue of Springer’s Journal of Maritime Archaeology (JMA) focuses on a single shipwreck as the lens through which maritime archaeology assesses the advent of the Atomic Age and the Cold War. The wreck is the World War II veteran aircraft carrier USS Independence, which was one of nearly a hundred ships used as targets in the first tests of the atomic bomb at Bikini Atoll in the summer of 1946.
The light aircraft carrier USS Independence (CVL-22) off Hunters Point in June 1944. Independence shows the unusual tumble-home hull form of her class. The deck cargo consists of twin-engined Lockheed PV-1 Ventura patrol bombers en-route to the combat area. USN photo. Photo and text from U.S. Aircraft Carriers: An Illustrated Design History, by Norman Friedman.
In addition to three original papers and two commentaries, the issue¹ also includes the now declassified files² on USS Independence’s post-Bikini history from the National Archives, published for the first time. The files are freely available online to the general public until 15 June 2016.
The Bikini tests, in the immediate aftermath of the atomic end to World War II in Japan, signaled a new era in world history. This era was grimly summarized in a then-classified report on the Bikini tests which suggested that, with the coming of the “Bomb,” it was possible to depopulate the earth, leaving only “vestigial remnants of man’s works.” While that fate has yet to (and hopefully will never will) come, what is presented in this issue is one of the remnants of the dawn of the nuclear age.
Aerial view of ex-USS Independence at anchor in San Francisco Bay, California, January 1951. There is visible damage from the atomic bomb tests at Bikini Atoll. The remains of Independence are resting in 2,600 feet of water off California’s Farallon Islands.
The wreck of the USS Independence lies nearly 30 miles off the central California coast. This is where the US Navy scuttled it to take it beyond the reach of potential Soviet espionage at the end of its usefulness as a nuclear test platform in 1951. The US National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Office of Ocean Exploration and Research and the Office of National Marine Sanctuaries worked with the Boeing Company in 2015 to pinpoint the wreck. The goal was to learn more about it in a deep water test that merged high-resolution sonar and a free swimming underwater robotic vehicle, “Echo Ranger.”

“The Journal of Maritime Archaeology is honored to be able to present the case study of the USS Independence,” says JMA’s co-editor-in-chief, Annalies Corbin. “NOAA’s achievements in contextualizing the work ahead for maritime archaeologists around the world as it relates to post-World War II and Cold War archaeology is critical to launching meaningful conversation and developing initial plans for underwater cultural heritage management of vessels like the USS Independence.”

The sonar image with oranges color tones (lower) shows an outline of a possible airplane in the forward aircraft elevator hatch opening. Credit: NOAA, Boeing, and Coda Octopus
“Historical and, by extension, maritime archaeology of the recent past can and should include merging documentary evidence with physical remains,” notes NOAA’s James Delgado, Director of Maritime Heritage for NOAA’s Office of National Marine Sanctuaries and lead scientist for the Independence mission. For this issue in the Journal of Maritime Archaeology, Delgado co-authored the report “Initial Archaeological Survey of the ex-USS Independence (CVL-22)” and also prepared a bibliographic essay on the subject and an article summarizing the fates of the Bikini target not sunk at Bikini.
The issue was edited by Annalies Corbin, who solicited contextual essays on the significance of the project and the subject of Cold War archaeology from Todd Hansen, Chief Historian and Archaeology for Los Alamos National Laboratory, and Robert E. Neyland, the Head of the US Navy’s Underwater Archaeology Branch.

From the Appendix: The archaeology of the Cold War can be said to involve ”excavating” through long-sealed, once classified files. In the National Archives branch in San Bruno, California, the files of the former Hunters Point Naval Shipyard contain a series of documents, all now declassified, which speak to the post-Crossroads history of the USS Independence. Dating from the incipient arrival of the USS Independence at San Francisco in May 1947, the documents discuss important matters such as the retention of some of the Crossroads target vessels, such as the Independence, their use in subsequent tests, radiation levels, and the decisions to remove machinery, stow radioactive materials in the ship, firing up the ship’s boilers to burn off the contaminated fuel oil left aboard, and finally the orders to dispose of it by sinking. Intermixed are more mundane documents that speak to the removal of small equipment, the installation of a watertight door to provide access at dock side, the shifting of berths, dry docking instructions, and security precautions. Together, they provide a detailed look into the beginning of the Atomic Age. They also provide some sense of what more detailed archaeological study of the wreck might reveal. The declassified documents and images are reproduced here in their original format. They have not been cropped or altered in any way.

How he keeps enjoying the privileges of the elite is a complete mystery that clearly has fossilised communist **Bernie Sanders** worried. After all, he’s a socialist who’s lived off the taxpayer all his life, yet somehow he has ended up being a multimillionaire who owns three houses.



Even worse for the dedicated climate activist, he somehow just keeps on finding himself kicking back in luxury jets. **A lot.**



A fellow passenger tweeted out a photo of Sen. Bernie Sanders flying first class on Wednesday, sparking an online debate over whether the 2020 presidential candidate was living out his socialist ideals.



“A nervous democratic socialist in first class,” tweeted **Hank Thomas** , the CEO of Washington, DC-based cybersecurity firm Strategic Cyber Ventures.



Like so many Marie Antoinettes, the fist-shakers and finger-waggers of the green-left sternly admonish us commoners against enjoying the odd cupcake, even as they gorge their way through the entire patisserie.



Sanders has forcefully railed against the injustices of economic inequality and painted the divide between wealthy Americans and everyone else as an “us versus them” scenario.



“Bernie keeps getting caught in first class. You’d think he would suck it up and fly coach or just get the private jet and avoid anyone seeing him,” said one commenter.



“Socialism for you Capitalism for me,” tweeted Brazilian pastor **Ronald Gustavo**.



Sanders used to rail against millionaires – until he became one, and was forced to upgrade his class rhetoric to billionaires.



In 2018, filings made by Sanders’ campaign showed he became a millionaire in 2016, thus joining the elite “1 percent” he so often lambasts[…]Sanders’ critics find it odd for a man with a burgeoning $2 million net worth and three-homes to be lecturing Americans on the excesses of wealth.



Ol’ Bernie just **loves** him some private jet luxury, though.



Bernie Sanders spent more on private jet travel in three months than his closest competitors in the Democratic presidential race […]after he endorsed former rival **Hillary Clinton** in 2016, he reportedly “repeatedly requested and received” a private jet to campaign on behalf of his former Democratic primary rival. 



He’s not the only fist-shaking wealthy green socialist to have a bent for the planet-killing perks of privilege, though.



Senator **Elizabeth Warren** has been branded a hypocrite after she was filmed getting off a private plane – despite railing against gas-guzzling rivals.



The presidential hopeful and environmental advocate touched down in Des Moines on Monday ahead of the crucial Iowa caucus.



Footage obtained by Fox News showed the Massachusetts Democrat stepping off the luxury jet with several of her campaign team in tow.



At one point in the video, she appears to wander behind a staffer sparking accusations she was trying to hide from the camera.



Elizabeth Warren deboards a private plane in Des Moines, Iowa last night.  
  
So much for the environment eh Pocahontas?  
  
? [pic.twitter.com/JStHyrQ7VF](https://t.co/JStHyrQ7VF)



Well, she should try and hide, given just how shockingly she is violating her own high-falutin’ principles. **By flying on a private jet Warren is vomiting out eight times as much carbon dioxide as one of us shmucks flying cattle class on a Boeing 737.**



But, hey, why should the socialist nomenklatura be expected to live like a damned pleb? They’ve got a planet to save.



Meanwhile, the _Babylon Bee_[suggests a better way](https://babylonbee.com/news/elizabeth-warren-sneaks-off-private-jet-under-large-cardboard-box) for Warren to avoid scrutiny.

"A group of artists and writers including Zadie Smith and Sir Mark Rylance have spoken out against the thinktanks and lobbyists at the heart of Westminster, gathering with hundreds of protesters near their offices on Wednesday night. Speakers from Writers Rebel, a group formed in support of the aims of Extinction Rebellion, blocked Tufton Street in London amid a noticeable police presence.  Offices on the street include that of the Global Warming Policy Foundation, which states on its website “while [it is] open-minded on the contested science of global warming, [it] is deeply concerned about the costs and other implications of many of the policies currently being advocated”. Four people, including author and XR member Rupert Read and Writers Rebel co-founder Jessica Townsend, were later arrested after spraying stencils reading “Lies, Lies, Economics and Lies” on the entrances to 55 Tufton Street. The group also occupied the street on large tripod constructions, and Read poured paint representing blood down the steps of the building. Speaking earlier, Smith, author of the novels White Teeth and On Beauty, said she had come to realise that her previous belief, that climate change denial was rooted in a genuine fear, was “naive”. “Now we know better. Now we know the outsized, unruly emotions that surround the scientific fact of climate change are fuelled by something far more calculated and external than species shame. They are not organic, natural or unavoidable, but rather feelings manufactured, targeted, organised, and paid for, largely by oil companies and other vested economic interests who are prepared to sacrifice your long-term future for their short-term profit. “There are people whose business it is to make science look like opinion. Who aim to transform genuine feelings of climate grief and guilt into defended ignorance and positive denial,” Smith said. “This is no longer, if it ever was, a question of personal morality. This is a structural question of corrupt politics, of lobbying at the highest level of our government. It involves the economic exploitation of the greatest existential challenge the human race has ever known, the survival of the planet. The fate of this planet cannot be decided by well-remunerated men and women in shadowy offices. This planet belongs to the people. More accurately, we all belong to it.” The protest was compered by the actors Juliet Stevenson and Rylance, who resigned from his role at the Royal Shakespeare Company in 2019, after 30 years, over the company’s ties to British Petroleum (BP). “It is a great comfort for me to be out here among people who I feel share my sense of confusion,” said Rylance, to applause. “There is a culture of misinformation and lying that surrounds us. And it is only getting worse.” Other speakers included Dame Carmen Callil, founder of the publisher Virago, and the MP Caroline Lucas, who came from tabling the climate and ecological emergency bill. “It is a fundamental proponent of democracy that we should know who is speaking,” said the environmentalist George Monbiot. “And what is speaking here is the power of money. And the power of money is the greatest threat to democracy and the greatest threat to life as we know it.” Margaret Atwood, author of books including The Handmaid’s Tale, lent her support via video message. “Climate change due to human activity is not a theory, it is not an opinion, it is a fact,” she said. “Denial of this fact in the interests of big money will lead to our extinction as a species.” Writers Rebel has previously been supported by the novelists Ali Smith, Naomi Alderman and Irenosen Okojie, the historian Simon Schama and the environmental writers Robert Macfarlane and Philip Hoare. At the launch of the Writers Rebel campaign last week, the writer and actor Stephen Fry said people had a duty to “expose the lies” of climate change denial. The demonstration was organised in conjunction with the nascent Extinction Rebellion group Money Rebellion, which will target the finance industry for its inaction on the climate emergency. The event took place as part of XR’s 10-day protest to demand government action on the climate crisis. The Metropolitan police said more than 230 people involved had so far been arrested. "
"EARNING THE ROCKIES How Geography Shapes America’s Role in the World By Robert D. Kaplan 201 pp. Random House. $27. Well over half of American voters, having cast ballots for Hillary Clinton or   candidates, awoke the next morning to a country that seems not only unfamiliar but  . Populists embrace a celebrity billionaire, evangelicals welcome a   Lothario, conservatives accept an opportunist whose only ideological commitment is to himself. The Republican establishment proves helpless against the hijacking of the party, the mainstream media prove ineffectual against the tide of fake news and the political system proves vulnerable to the machinations of a sinister foreign government. Longstanding global alliances are questioned, longstanding political norms are trashed  —   and then the candidate with the    plurality loses. In what alternative universe does this make any sense? As Karl Marx said, in a very different context: All that is solid melts into air. Or maybe not. Maybe the political air is turbulent but the country’s tectonic fundamentals remain solid. Maybe American politics and geopolitics rest on a foundation as immovable as the rivers and plains of the country itself. For those who feel disoriented, and also (perhaps especially) for those who feel triumphant, Robert D. Kaplan’s small but magisterial new book, “Earning the Rockies,” is a tonic, because it brings fundamentals back into view. With only 180 uncrowded pages of text, this is a book that can be read on a    flight, but fully digesting it will take much longer. Every page brings a fresh insight, a telling aperçu, a bracing reality check. If you do read the book at 30, 000 feet, it will make you yearn to be down below. To understand the country, Kaplan posits, one must still “earn the Rockies,” reaching them on terra firma as our ancestors did. “To fly to California and set your clock back three hours is not to know the ground you have covered, because you haven’t seen all the different mornings and evenings along the way. ” Kaplan is one of America’s most distinguished writers on foreign affairs, with 16 prior books to his name. (He and I are both contributing editors of The Atlantic, though we don’t know each other.) Many will recall his 1994 Atlantic article (then book) “The Coming Anarchy,” which looks eerily prescient today. In his teens as a hitchhiker and again in middle age as a journalist, Kaplan trekked across the continental United States. Today, perplexed by America’s pivot against the successful global order that Americans built, he repeats the journey, “for the answers to our dilemmas overseas lie within the continent itself. ” He returns with a musing travelogue, one that seeks, in words as carefully chosen as gemstones, to bring America’s geographic and geopolitical fundamentals back into the picture. He begins in the East, where the landscape is vertical, cluttered with tall trees and taller cities. Walking streets that are thriving and dismal by turns, and overhearing conversations in rural diners and urban coffeehouses, he encounters not one country but two. Wheeling, in West Virginia coal country, is in a shocking state of collapse, but across the bridge in Marietta, Ohio, he finds prosperity fueled by   fracking. In Bloomington, the home of Indiana University, he finds “a truly global civilization,” demarcated by “miles and miles of expensive restaurants and   people. ” The new “universal civilization” is slowly dissolving local distinctiveness, but only for some: Bloomington’s elites understand their British counterparts better than they do their compatriots in Wheeling. In place after place, Kaplan encounters people who, though friendly and   “have in some important ways just given up. ” Even in blue states, many “feel their way of life is being endangered and fear being economically left behind in this new world of slim people on   diets with stylish clothes. ” Then the “horizontal landscape” of the Great Plains unfurls before him, followed by the great American desert of the West, endless landscapes that forged an independent ethos yet, paradoxically, were built with the aid of enormous government investment. Here he finds the cradle of America’s international ambitions: “If this unending vastness could be conquered, then, after some fashion, the world could be, too. ” At last, he arrives in San Diego, overlooking the port of the mighty United States Pacific Fleet and peering over the horizon toward Asia, where the fleet’s patrols keep an uneasy peace. What do we learn along the way? For all the turbulent change swirling about us now, America was and remains the product of an exceptional geography. North America has more miles of navigable inland waterways than much of the rest of the world combined. Better still, its rivers run diagonally rather than (as in Russia) north and south, forming an ideal network for internal communication and trade. Moreover, America’s continental span and rich resource base shield it from external threat and dependency. Thus the United States is uniquely blessed by geography to form and sustain a cohesive continental union. Union is not the same as unity, but it’s a good start. America’s geographical and hydrological blessings ramify not only inward but also outward. “The United States is not a normal country: Its geographic bounty gave it the possibility of becoming a world power, and with that power it has developed longstanding obligations, which, on account of its continued economic and social dynamism relative to other powers, it keeps,” Kaplan writes. “We are,” he says (his italics) “fated to lead. ” For a host of reasons, ranging from geography to culture, no other country can play the same role. Kaplan embraces America’s   role but is no imperialist. His book is most challenging, and most valuable, for the layers of paradox it mines. Geography and union make the United States a hegemon whose auspices create the conditions for globalization  —   but globalization diminishes America’s geographical advantages and erodes American unity. Meanwhile, as globalization uproots local economies and norms, the communications revolution spawns new tribal and ideological identities, everything from jihadism to  . “It isn’t the clash of civilizations so much as the clash of artificially reconstructed civilizations that is taking place,” Kaplan writes. Finally, globalization, a product of American influence and a bulwark against chaos, erodes American influence and births new disruptions. For all its unrivaled military and economic power, the United States “now has no possibility of bringing order to the world. ” The best we can hope for is to reduce disorder. Doing that requires projecting power, yes, but with a “light and subtle footprint. ” It won’t be easy. “Earning the Rockies” was written before the 2016 election. The name “Trump” appears only a few times. Yet there is more insight here into the Age of Trump than in bushels of    journalism. George H. W. Bush imagined a new world order and, for a time, built one Bill Clinton embraced soft power and democratic globalization and, for a time, made them work George W. Bush rediscovered history, confrontation, hard power and blowback Barack Obama sought to revive Clinton’s formula but, in the end, left too many behind. And then came Trump, repudiating all of the above for irredentist nationalism, and smashing crockery as none have done since Andrew Jackson. Where are we now? In territory that is uncharted but not altogether unfamiliar. President Trump may try to ignore the paradoxes of geography and globalism, but he cannot escape them. In the long run, Kaplan reminds us, the shape of the river constrains the pilot’s course. America will continue to lead, because it must."

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: March 31, 2016
(March 31, 2016) The U.S. premiere of CFACT’s groundbreaking new documentary, Climate Hustle will take place at a Capitol Hill briefing in the historic Rayburn Office Building, including a riveting panel discussion on climate change featuring Gov. Sarah Palin and other notable guests. The invitation-only briefing and panel discussion will be held on April 14, 2016 from 4 to 6 p.m. The event comes just a week prior to the opening for signature of the U.N. Paris Agreement on climate change on Earth Day (April 22), and just a short time before Climate Hustle is seen in select U.S. cinemas for a one-night presentation by Fathom Events and SpectiCast on May 2, 2016 at 7:00 p.m. local time.
With welcoming remarks by Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX), Chairman of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee and headlined by Gov. Sarah Palin (2008 Republican Vice Presidential Candidate; 9th Governor of Alaska), the panel will be taped and shown during the national theater event. The discussion will be moderated by Brent Bozell, Founder and President of the Media Research Center, and will also include other notable experts including respected climatologist Dr. David Legates and a special video appearance by Emmy Award-winning educator Bill Nye the Science Guy. The panel will further examine some of the science, politics, and media coverage of the climate issue, and go far toward helping debunk much of the alarmism and hype exposed in the Climate Hustle film.
David Rothbard, Executive Producer of the film and President of CFACT, said “We are honored to be having Climate Hustle’s U.S. premiere take place on Capitol Hill, and are excited to be bringing the film to life with a provocative discussion featuring some of the biggest names in the climate debate.”
About Climate Hustle
Climate Hustle presented by CFACT and CDR Communications, in partnership with Event Cinema provider SpectiCast, will be seen nationwide in a one-night engagement in select cinemas that debunks the myths and hype about man-made global warming in an informative and entertaining style. The film examines the question of whether there is a genuine scientific consensus about alleged man-made global warming and features more than 30 scientists and experts.

L. Ron Hubbard famously said that, if you want to make a million dollars, start a religion. Today, he would probably advocate starting a left-wing NGO.



As [already reported on _The BFD_](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/02/yes-the-left-really-do-have-a-media-stranglehold/), left-wing advocacy groups are raking in the (usually taxpayer-funded) millions and paying themselves quite handsomely. Hey, you didn’t think all that first-class travel to Swiss resorts, to bang on about climate change, comes cheap, did you?



 **These people have a lifestyle to maintain – and they’re making damned sure someone else pays for it.**



GetUp spent more than 70 per cent of the $12.4m in public donations it raised last year on staff salaries, administration costs and travel, despite telling supporters “every dollar” they gave would be used to build a fairer Australia with spending on billboards, hard-hitting TV ads and rallies.



[…]GetUp appears to use a high proportion of supporters’ donations to pay for running costs — especially salaries — compared with other organisations in the charities and non-profit sector.



The nomenklatura are nothing if not defensive about enjoying the perks of unelected office.



[National Director **Paul** ] **Oosting** defended $7.2m paid to more than six top GetUp executives, including himself, and 50 other lower-level staff on the group’s payroll, telling The Australian they were the “driving force” behind the group’s issues-based campaigns.



“GetUp’s strategists, campaigners, organisers and developers are some of our greatest assets,” he said.



The GetUp chief declined to respond when asked how his organisation’s donations income-to-expenditure ratio compared with others in the charities and non-profit industry. He declined to confirm salary levels for individual leaders, including himself, which are figures commonly disclosed in the filed reports of major companies and trade unions.



Like all scoundrels, when caught with their hand in the till, they’re quick to try and deflect their guilt by pointing the finger at someone else.



“False reporting from News Corporation papers is frustrating for everyone, but GetUp members are confident that every dollar we raise works to achieve progressive outcomes,” he said.



“Progressive outcomes”…like [bullying and stalking female politicians](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/07/political-net-closing-in-on-getup-thugs/)? Trying to take over institutions like the [Press Council](https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/getup-activist-set-to-get-the-boot-from-press-council-board-20180510-p4zeln.html) [Scamming money](https://www.skynews.com.au/details/_6103284227001) on the back of this summer’s bushfire tragedy?



For its “bushfire relief efforts” appeal, GetUp’s website tells supporters their donations will be used to help cover the cost of ongoing GetUp campaigns that have the same purpose “if we raise more than the cost of this campaign”.



 **Compare GetUp to other non-profits.** Red Cross spends a higher-than-usual amount, 50%, on salaries – but much of those salaries are for people doing useful things like delivering blood and other humanitarian services. Not lining the pockets of professional left-wing agitators.



St Vincent de Paul spent half as much as GetUp does on salaries. The Starlight Children’s Foundation just one-tenth as much. But, again, **both of those do actual charitable works rather than bullying and brow-beating and trying to stack elections with leftist puppets**.



They also don’t cloak themselves in Stalinist secrecy.



GetUp’s only members under its corporate structure are the nine people listed in annual reports who sit on its board, plus three founding members. All others that GetUp calls its “million-plus”, “1.45 million” and “998,652” members in annual reports are supporters, volunteers or names on an email database with no voting or other rights.



Even GetUp’s fanatical army of nosey-nannas and unemployables are starting to notice.



GetUp faces rising dissent in its ranks from supporters who claim the left-wing campaign group’s leadership is “secretive” about how it spends millions of dollars raised from public donations, and no real power is allowed to so-called “members” in running the organisation.



Longtime GetUp volunteers who have worked in senior campaign roles said the group’s senior executives disliked criticism, and questions about operations were often rebuffed.



“GetUp is terribly secretive,” a former volunteer said. “They seem to take the view that new people are coming in all the time, so it doesn’t matter if they lose others.”



Well, they’re not wrong. There’s always another useful idiot waiting in the wings for the next purge.

"After years studying the climate, my work has brought me to Sydney where I’m studying the linkages between climate change and extreme weather events. Prior to beginning my sabbatical stay in Sydney, I took the opportunity this holiday season to vacation in Australia with my family. We went to see the Great Barrier Reef – one of the great wonders of this planet – while we still can. Subject to the twin assaults of warming-caused bleaching and ocean acidification, it will be gone in a matter of decades in the absence of a dramatic reduction in global carbon emissions. We also travelled to the Blue Mountains, another of Australia’s natural wonders, known for its lush temperate rainforests, majestic cliffs and rock formations and panoramic vistas that challenge any the world has to offer. It too is now threatened by climate change. I witnessed this firsthand. I did not see vast expanses of rainforest framed by distant blue-tinged mountain ranges. Instead I looked out into smoke-filled valleys, with only the faintest ghosts of distant ridges and peaks in the background. The iconic blue tint (which derives from a haze formed from “terpenes” emitted by the Eucalyptus trees that are so plentiful here) was replaced by a brown haze. The blue sky, too, had been replaced by that brown haze. The locals, whom I found to be friendly and outgoing, would volunteer that they have never seen anything like this before. Some even uttered the words “climate change” without any prompting. The songs of Peter Garrett and Midnight Oil I first enjoyed decades ago have taken on a whole new meaning for me now. They seem disturbingly prescient in light of what we are witnessing unfold in Australia. The brown skies I observed in the Blue Mountains this week are a product of human-caused climate change. Take record heat, combine it with unprecedented drought in already dry regions and you get unprecedented bushfires like the ones engulfing the Blue Mountains and spreading across the continent. It’s not complicated. The warming of our planet – and the changes in climate associated with it – are due to the fossil fuels we’re burning: oil, whether at midnight or any other hour of the day, natural gas, and the biggest culprit of all, coal. That’s not complicated either. When we mine for coal, like the controversial planned Adani coalmine, which would more than double Australia’s coal-based carbon emissions, we are literally mining away at our blue skies. The Adani coalmine could rightly be renamed the Blue Sky mine. In Australia, beds are burning. So are entire towns, irreplaceable forests and endangered and precious animal species such as the koala (arguably the world’s only living plush toy) are perishing in massive numbers due to the unprecedented bushfires. The continent of Australia is figuratively – and in some sense literally – on fire. Yet the prime minister, Scott Morrison, appears remarkably indifferent to the climate emergency Australia is suffering through, having chosen to vacation in Hawaii as Australians are left to contend with unprecedented heat and bushfires. Morrison has shown himself to be beholden to coal interests and his administration is considered to have conspired with a small number of petrostates to sabotage the recent UN climate conference in Madrid (“COP25”), seen as a last ditch effort to keep planetary warming below a level (1.5°C) considered by many to constitute “dangerous” planetary warming. But Australians need only wake up in the morning, turn on the television, read the newspaper or look out the window to see what is increasingly obvious to many – for Australia, dangerous climate change is already here. It’s simply a matter of how much worse we’re willing to allow it to get. Australia is experiencing a climate emergency. It is literally burning. It needs leadership that is able to recognise that and act. And it needs voters to hold politicians accountable at the ballot box. Australians must vote out fossil-fuelled politicians who have chosen to be part of the problem and vote in climate champions who are willing to solve it. This article originally appeared in The Guardian and is republished here as part of Covering Climate Now, a global journalistic collaboration to strengthen coverage of the climate story."

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhat follows is a press release from the Alfred Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven, Germany. 
It turns out that microalgae — “an important source of food in the oceans” — are far more resilient to changes in ocean pH values than alarmists would like us to believe.
Hat-tip: Die kalte Sonne.
===================================
Tiny algae, hugely resilient

Microalgae are microscopically small, single-celled algae species and an important source of food in the oceans. Dr Clara Hoppe of the Alfred Wegener Institute examines how changed living conditions as a result of climate change affect Arctic microalgae.

Clara Hoppe has been observing how Arctic microalgae react to climate change since years. (Photo: Paolo VeAWI biologist)
Dr Clara Hoppe has always had a plan B in place for her Arctic expeditions. “Three years ago, when I started to work in the Arctic, everyone told me to think carefully about what I should do in case the Kongsfjorden area in Svalbard freezes over and I can’t leave with a small ship,” says Clara Hoppe. Many times she ran through the scenario of thick ice blocking the way into the fjord. But plan B never materialised.
“So far, I have never experienced ice on the fjord. The water temperature was always above zero degrees Celsius,” the 32-year-old tells us. The factors that make Clara Hoppe’s job easier in practice, are also the subject of her research: She tries to understand how environmental conditions that are changing as a result of climate change, affect the microalgae of the Arctic Ocean. This includes the rise of the water temperature as well as the acidification of the oceans and changed light conditions in the water due to the decrease in sea ice.
Unlike macroalgae, microalgae are not visible to the naked eye, they are microscopically small, single-celled algae species. They are so tiny that one millilitre of water can contain thousands of them. Because microalgae are an important source of food, such as for crustaceans like krill, a change in their growth, for example, could have far-reaching implications for the Arctic food web.

A special feature about Clara Hoppe’s research: While traditional research on ocean acidification is often carried out in the laboratory, she and her team regularly take several hundred litres of water samples in the Arctic, which allows them to study a diverse community of several dozen algae species that are there at that time. “This greater diversity of species means that we can perform experiments to analyse, which of the many species benefit from climate change and which suffer from it. Also, the relationships between the species can be studied,” Clara Hoppe explains.


Back in Bremerhaven, she, too, spends many hours in the lab. There she subjects the microalgae to different conditions: “For example, we raise the temperature or the carbon dioxide content of the water to observe how the different species from the Arctic respond to this.” One of the things Clara Hoppe analyses is how much biomass the algae create. Do they store more carbon when conditions change? Or more nitrogen? The latter makes the algae much more valuable as a food.
The most important microalgae in the Arctic are diatoms. They create a hard skeleton out of silica to protect themselves from predators. What happens when the water gets warmer or contains more carbon dioxide? If, for example, the diatoms build heavier skeletons, they would sink to the ground more quickly. This also includes the carbon they have fixed into biomass, which means that it would not be part of the global carbon cycle for many years.
These would all be conceivable scenarios. But the surprising thing is this: “I spent years at the microscope and noticed hardly any differences”, Clara Hoppe explains. This is intrinsically a good thing, but the biologist had to get used to it. “As a researcher, I am hardwired, as it were, to detect changes and effects. But in the end I realised that the fact that these organisms do not react as strongly as other species in other regions is incredibly exciting. I want to find out why this is the case. Why are Arctic microalgae so resilient? What are the mechanisms behind this?”
She already has a hypothesis: The microalgae respond differently to environmental changes such as temperature rises. Even within a species, not every microalgae deals with it in the same way. It seems that this flexibility makes the species community as a whole more robust. The greater the diversity within a species, the better the microalgae are able to soften the effects of environmental changes.
“This is a bit like good teamwork,” the biologist says. “To achieve a better overall result, it’s often better to have a team of individuals with different skills and preferences, because whoever is best at something does the job.”
Over time, in a community of algae, the individuals who best adjust to the respective conditions represent a greater percentage of a population and thus make up for the “deficits” of the others. And that could be why the productivity of the algae community can stay the same in the long term.
That’s as far as her hypothesis goes. In practice, Clara Hoppe will continue to go out into the Kongsfjorden to find answers to her questions – but she worries less and less about having to execute plan B.

Guest essay by Eric Worrall
h/t James Delingpole – Disgraced former head of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Rajendra Pachauri has struck back at accusations he has been , with claims that he was set up by his opponents.
According to The Guardian;
Faced with prison, ruin and disgrace when his case comes before the Delhi courts next month, Pachauri has resigned from the IPCC and stepped back from Teri, the huge energy research institute that he founded and which has taken solar lighting to hundreds of millions of Indians. Meanwhile, his many enemies are revelling in his discomfort, his health has suffered and he has been subject to death threats and demonstrations by women’s groups.
His accuser, who cannot be named, is a science graduate. She says he besieged her with offensive messages, emails and texts in the 16 months she spent working with him. In February 2015, she gave police a cache of several thousand electronic messages as evidence.
She says she rejected Pachauri’s “carnal and perverted” advances. “On many occasions, Dr Pachauri forcibly grabbed my body, hugged me, held my hands, kissed me and touched my body in an inappropriate manner,” she told police.
…
Until now, Pachauri has said nothing about the case beyond denying all the charges, and claiming that his emails and computers had been hacked or misused. Now, however, in a series of emails with the Observer and in one meeting in London, he claims that his accuser was acting for money, and was probably set up to trap him by persons unknown.
He claims that she had access to all his five email accounts, and to his electronic files which included personal correspondence and many poems that he had written over the years.
“What is disturbing [is] that right from the first day over a period of about 16 months she was creating and assembling an archive of messages, which to anyone would seem very unusual. As far as I know, the emails, text messages etc that she collected were personal, semi-personal and only in a few cases official,” he says.
He claims it would have been easy for someone to have assumed his identity and sent messages seemingly from him to her, without his knowledge.
Read more: http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/26/rajendra-pachauri-hits-back-harassed-female-colleague-claims
In my opinion Pachauri’s defence is implausible. Quite apart from the confused nature of Pachauri’s claim, in which he appears to suggest he was entrapped and hacked at the same time (so which perverted messages were sent by Pachauri, as part of the “entrapment” process, and which messages were sent by hackers?), it simply seems implausible that the alleged victim received perverted sexual messages over a period of 16 months, without mentioning it to someone.
If you received suggestive, perverted messages from a friend or colleague, messages which seemed completely out of character, surely the first thing you would do is tell your friend or colleague that something was wrong. At the very least you would ask them to stop, or if it seemed utterly implausible that they were sending such messages, you would tell them their account had been hacked.
If your polite request to stop making lewd suggestions was rebuffed, and you were worried about your job and reputation, then the obvious next step would be to collect evidence that you were the victim of sexual harassment – especially if the perpetrator was an authority figure. So in my view there is nothing odd about the fact that the alleged victim has a large record of messages received from Pachauri, which she submitted to the police, when her alleged situation finally became unbearable.
This is not the first time Climate Alarmists have attempted to deflect criticism of their conduct with wild conspiracy theories. Perhaps conspiracist ideation is what climate alarmists do, when they are caught with their pants down, metaphorically or otherwise, when there is no reasonable defence for their actions.
If you have any lingering doubts about who the victim in this case is, consider the credibility destroying gaffs Pachauri has made over the years, such as his ridiculous melting Himalayan glacier claim. Pachauri was far more valuable to skeptics as the bungling Chairman of the IPCC, than he will be as a forgotten nobody. His entertaining IPCC clown show will be missed.

A paywalled article in the _Financial Times_ reports the musings of Cambridge Professor of Engineering and the Environment, **Julian Allwood**. His conclusion is that the only way for aviation to hit net zero by 2050 is to stop flying. Yeah right!



Dreaming of electric planes and planting trees will not save our planet



The UK aviation industry this week promised to bring its net carbon emissions down to zero by 2050 while growing by 70 per cent, and Prime Minister **Boris Johnson** boldly predicted that “viable electric planes” would be available in just a few years.



In response to an [earlier post](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/02/this-is-the-type-of-thing-the-facepalm-emoji-was-invented-for/) on _The BFD_ , reader **Brian Dingwall** posted some interesting facts: _“An Airbus A320 Neo carries 266MWh of fuel energy. A battery pack carrying the same energy would weight 1640 tons, 19 times the maximum, take-off weight. [Plugged into] a 1MW source it would take 11 days to charge.”_ We are going to need a lot more space at the airports to park all the planes while charging.



“A ha”, I hear you say, “what about Moore’s Law and everything getting smaller, faster, lighter like computers and smartphones?” Brian’s factoids go on to point out: _“Not applicable. Electrons in a microprocessor do not take up space but ions in a battery do. Only major new battery chemistry will bring major changes.”_



So we have a wee way to go before we take our first battery-powered long-haul vacation.



But past experience with innovation in aviation suggests that such **ambitious targets are unrealistic and distracting**. The only way the UK can get to net zero emission aviation by 2050 is by having **a substantial period of no aviation at all**. Let’s stop placing impossible hopes on breakthrough technologies, and try to hit emissions targets with today’s technologies. Our recent report “Absolute Zero” draws on work at six British universities to explain how. […]



So the commitment to net zero aviation by 2050 is **really a commitment to zero aviation**. Rather than hope new technology will magically rescue us, we should stop planning to increase fossil-fuel flights and commit to halving them within 10 years with an eye toward phasing them out entirely by 2050.



Taxing aircraft fuel at the level of the UK’s current road fuel tax would be a useful first step: **I estimate that it would make flights up to four times more expensive.**



Climate policy announcements so far have failed to account for the limited rate at which new technologies can reach significant scale. Fifty years after the Danes began developing wind turbines, **they contribute just 2 per cent of world primary energy.** Regardless of prices or incentives, new energy generation, transport and industrial processes require public consultation on regulations, land use, funding, environmental impacts and more. This all slows down their adoption.



So the first step is to hike fuel costs and thus ticket prices by a factor of 4 and if that doesn’t work then ground all the planes – simple. Although I do wonder how the CoP delegates are going to get to their annual ~~wasteful talkfests~~ conferences. Perhaps St Greta can organise [a fleet of yachts?](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/08/st-greta-nails-her-colours-to-the-mast/)



Shaw’s Zero Carbon plan must include the zero carbon plane, shawley?

Before he noticed that China was staging a _Silent Invasion_ of Australia, academic **Clive Hamilton** was claiming that the communist nation might well be the model state to tackle climate change. While democracies are hamstrung, supposedly, by the stupid ‘denying’ masses, authoritarian states like China can just snap their fingers and get it done. (Which, oddly enough, were the kinds of arguments made for fascism in the 1920s.)



Yet Hamilton also, ludicrously, claims that China “have reached their peak and will now decline. Possibly reasonably rapidly”. Which suggests that he may be far more immune to evidence than the ‘deniers’ he sneers at.



The failure of the communists with regard to COVID-19 is likewise evidence that his faith in authoritarian states’ ability to deal with crises is ridiculously misplaced.



We can be sure the ­Chinese Communist Party will deny any responsibility for the coronavirus outbreak until its dying day, since autocratic elites are incapable of acknowledging mistakes, let alone learning from them[…]From the transmission of the virus from wild animals to ­humans, to the suppression of ­information that might have allowed it to be contained, every­thing about this story is stamped Made in China.



The authoritarian, top-down model of society that Beijing outrageously claims is the solution to the crisis was the reason it started.



China’s first instinct in a crisis is to lie, obfuscate and censor. Yet its useful idiots in the media and academe eagerly spread its lies – ironically using the very social media banned and censored in China.



The Chinese live-streaming platform YY began censoring key words related to the coronavirus outbreak on New Year’s Eve, a day before the Wuhan Seafood Market was shut down and three weeks before Chinese health officials admitted human-to-human transmission.



Researchers at Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto demonstrated the effectiveness of social media censorship by sending sample messages on WeChat.



The message “Hello. US Centre for Disease Control says hand washing is more effective to prevent catch coronavirus than face masks” turned up in the recipient’s inbox as simply “Hello”.



On the other hand, China’s near-neighbours such as Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan – relatively open and free – are dealing far more successfully with their respective outbreaks.



China’s efforts to persuade the world that it is on top of the crisis are believed by almost no one.



The figures announced by the Hong Kong health department, on the other hand, are believed by almost everyone. As of Sunday there were 114 confirmed cases in the territory and two deaths, remarkable given Hong Kong shares a land border with China and is among the most population-dense places in the world[…]



Singapore (138 cases) has also managed to control the virus without resort to unnecessary repression. Taiwan (45 cases) is doing particularly well. The authorities invested heavily in prevention measures for pandemics after SARS killed 181 Taiwanese in 2003.



Taiwan’s response — low on compulsion, high on voluntary compliance — is so far the most successful of any country.



This has been China’s model from the very instant it arrested the first doctor to even admit that something was going wrong. Nothing else symbolises China’s flaws, perhaps, than the fate of one of its treatment centres. Just a week ago, the communist bosses were flooding social media with boastful stories that they had built a “coronavirus hospital” in a week. This week, a hotel converted into a quarantine facility collapsed.



China’s determination to blow its own trumpet would be laughable if it were not being accepted so unquestionably by those who should know better, including the World Health Organisation.



Reliable reports from inside China are becoming rarer. Li Zehua, who quit his job at state-run TV station CCTV to expose the reality of life inside the Wuhan lockdown zone, live-streamed his own arrest two weeks ago and hasn’t been heard of since. At least two other citizen journalists in Wuhan suffered the same fate.



Once again the brute facts give the lie to the authoritarian fantasies of those who insist that democracy is ‘weak’ and let down by the ‘stupidity of the masses’. The only thing authoritarian states like China excel at is secrecy and repression. No wonder the globalists are so bewitched by China.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThere are a few dozen very high profile climate science skeptics/dissidents who are constantly in the cross hairs of the alarmist climate  activists, and Marc Morano is certainly near the top of the list among them.

Leading climate science skeptic says science underpinning man-made global warming and consensus are crumbling to pieces before our eyes. Image cropped from documentary The Climate Hustle.
Long a festering thorn in the side of climate activists, Morano is often seen bringing his message to the public through the national news media, and is often the object of vicious attacks, something he seems to relish.
He was prominently featured in the powerful climate skeptic documentary film “The Climate Hustle,” which focused the public’s attention on the widespread scientific inaccuracies plaguing climate science, how the scientific consensus is crumbling, and how global warming is just dogma.
Recently he gave a speech at the 2016 Energy Summit where he says that global warming is just the latest in a string of earlier scares that never came to pass. In his speech he describes the hostile environment that climate science skeptics face, where they are equated to Holocaust deniers who need to be prosecuted and jailed.
The former aide to US senator James Inhofe says the often-heard claim of a 97% consensus was pulled out of thin air, but has been repeated over and over again by mainstream media. He reminds that a number of leading scientists have reversed their positions on man-made climate science, saying:
You find not only is there no consensus, huge numbers of scientists are openly skeptical.”
Moreover, climate has become less severe, in fact.

google_ad_height = 200;

Later in the speech he calls IPCC science government-bought and that it is a “political body posing as a scientific institution“. On how science is being exaggerated to spread fear, Morano debunks the claim, citing a leading extreme weather expert (15:00):
On every single metric of hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, droughts, not only are they not increasing or staying stable, they are actually decreasing on climate scales.”
He points out that the climate warming is still in its pause, despite the recent warm year. Morano then equates climate science to modern day witchcraft as politicians claim their policies impact the weather — as if to say that the more regulation and taxes that get imposed, the better the weather will get. And should the weather remain bad, then it simply means that regulation and taxes need to be even higher.
Morano says policymakers have become so zealous with climate change that they no longer care if the science is right or not, and that what matters is more regulation. The situation is urgent and there’s no time for more debate, they claim.
Wackiness knows no limits
He then mocks the notion that CO2 has “poisoned” our weather, and no matter what happens, it’s global warming’s fault – comparing the hysteria to Moslems blaming yoyos for bad weather back in 1933.
He ridicules how studies have claimed an increase in both opposite extremes: more drought/less drought, more malaria/less malaria, more snow/less snow, less rain/more rain, etc.. No matter what happens, they’ll claim they predicted it. The wackiness in climate science knows no limits. Overall global warming is good for bad, and bad for good. “Global warming caused Hitler, global warming saved Hitler.”
Later in the speech, Morano describes climate science as a religion, cult-like, where anyone challenging it is labelled a heretic and could face suffering in the afterlife. He then calls the father of modern global warming movement, NASA’s James Hansen, “a hardcore ideological activist”.
Morano ends by pleading for a return to sanity, reminding us that “acts of the U.N. and the U.S. Congress or EPA cannot control the climate or weather“.
He says what is needed is a defunding of the EPA and UN and to not sign any UN climate treaty.

It was approximately a month ago that _The BFD_ [featured](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/01/apparently-the-north-never-got-the-memo/) this graph, so it is time to check in again on **Dr David Viner’s** prediction that children soon won’t know what snow is. Dr Viner predicted in 2000 that “ _within a few years winter snowfall will become a rare and exciting event_.”



We are now 20 years beyond then, and although a “few years” was not strictly quantified in the good doctor’s prediction I submit that two decades is a tad longer than ‘within a few’.



So how is the [snow mass graph](https://globalcryospherewatch.org/state_of_cryo/snow/fmi_swe_tracker.jpg) getting on?



Eyeballing that graph suggests that this year is 15% up on the 1982 -2012 average. Time for David to update his prediction? 



“Ah, but!” I hear the Doomers say, “What happens when it all melts? Sea level rise, that’s what! – We Doomers have covered all the bases with our ‘Climate Change’ scenarios.”

"Extinction Rebellion was once criticised by other activists for “love bombing the cops”, but now it has found itself labelled a terror threat. In a guide sent to teachers by counter-terrorism police, the non-violent group’s logo and activities were described to help them spot students who may be involved.  The guide – which includes neo-Nazi and Islamist terror groups – has since been withdrawn and Extinction Rebellion may yet sue, but this extreme response should come as no surprise to anyone who has been paying attention to how states are treating environmental protest.  In 2015, the Federal Australian government released a similar booklet called “Preventing Violent Extremism and Radicalisation in Australia”. It shared the story of “Karen”, who “attends an environmental protest and gets mixed up with a radical green group”, eventually dropping out of school to “devote herself to forest protests”. Here also, Karen the environmentalist appears alongside neo-Nazis.

      Radical environmentalists are fighting climate change – so why are they persecuted?


 Alerting teachers to environmental protest is one thing, but more direct state confrontation has a much longer lineage in the UK. In 1968, in response to anti-Vietnam War protests that turned violent at the US Embassy, the Metropolitan Police was instructed by the government to establish the Special Demonstration Squad, nicknamed “the Hairies”.  In its 40 year history, the squad deployed officers in a range of (mostly left-wing) protest groups. I was at the Earth First! gathering in 2003 when Mark Stone (actually Mark Kennedy) made his first appearance. In 2010, having been involved in environmental protests across Europe, Stone was finally exposed following an investigation by his erstwhile comrades. Other police officers deployed in Climate Camp were also uncovered, and a public inquiry is still underway. Several women were targeted by police spies for relationships. In one case, an activist was impregnated and deserted by an undercover police officer. But this sort of spying isn’t merely the preserve of national government. Recently, it was revealed that Sheffield council wanted the police to hand over details of tree campaigners. In the US, the FBI has had a long history of spying on environmental organisations, and even encouraging violence against them. In 1990, Earth First! activist Judi Bari was seriously injured after a nail bomb detonated in her car. In 2002, four FBI agents were found guilty of trying to frame Bari for the bombing. Since then, the persecution of environmental activists has only worsened, with the high-profile murder of Berta Caceres in 2016. The work of Peace Brigades International – a non-violent peace-keeping organisation – now includes protecting environmental campaigners. Meanwhile, as the ecological crisis deepens and more people feel obliged to do something, security forces around the world are becoming more involved in the surveillance – and interruption – of peaceful movements for environmental protection. Reputational smears and the threat of violence are intended to make recruitment and retention more difficult for protest groups, and this can be very effective. But will increased police scrutiny hamper Extinction Rebellion? Research on social movements suggests that getting involved in high-risk action usually takes place via friendship or community networks, but one of the interesting features of Extinction Rebellion is just how many people, little known to each other initially, were “up” for arrestable action.  This could mean that existing theories of social movements are inadequate for understanding Extinction Rebellion, but it may also mean that, without strong interpersonal links to rely on when the going gets tough, the group will go up like a rocket and down like a stick.

      Climate change: COP26 Glasgow will provide world stage for Scotland's green innovation


 Time will tell, but there is a certain naïveté here. If you call yourself a “rebellion” and demand fundamental change from powerful forces like the state and corporations, you should expect a response. The next foreseeable arena is Glasgow, as the world prepares for COP26. Extinction Rebellion has told its followers that “all roads lead to COP26 … We must be there in our droves”. There is a lot at stake, for the movement and climate action. Don’t be surprised if the crackdown continues against Extinction Rebellion."
"The 2020s will have to involve some very big decisions about transport – the UK’s most polluting sector. The UK government’s response so far has been erratic, choosing to intervene to prevent the collapse of Flybe (Europe’s biggest regional airline) and give the green light for the high-speed rail project, HS2. Decarbonising transport would eliminate 26% of UK CO₂ emissions that come from how people get around. But Prime Minister Boris Johnson recently said that doing this poses “difficult and complicated” questions. On this, Johnson is almost certainly right. The gilets jaunes protests against fuel duty rises in France show the delicate balancing act between decisive climate action and continued economic growth and convenience. But shouldn’t the government allow a regional flight operator to fail and invest in high-speed rail instead? The answer is not so simple. Aviation is one of the fastest growing fossil fuel consumers, with airlines contributing about 3.5% of all man-made greenhouse gas emissions. This might seem small, but a single transatlantic flight from London to New York can grow your personal carbon footprint by as much as the entire heating budget of the average European. At high altitudes, contrails – the white lines we see in the sky – are formed in the wake of aircraft. These high altitude clouds are too thin to reflect much sunlight, but the ice crystals inside them can trap heat. Unlike low-level cloud, which has a net-cooling effect, contrails contribute significantly to global warming, effectively boosting the aviation industry’s share of greenhouse gas emissions to around 4.9%. For the most part, the environmental benefit of high-speed rail is taken for granted. Most, but not all, research suggests that high-speed rail can offset emissions from aviation if it can attract enough passengers from alternative air routes. But the relative climate impacts of aviation to other modes of transport depend on more than just engines and altitude. We can compare the emissions of different forms of transport by calculating the emissions produced by each one when moving one passenger one kilometre. This effectively compares how much CO₂ leaves each vehicle’s exhaust, but it ignores greenhouse gas emissions from the building and maintenance of the vehicles, the infrastructure – such as tracks, runways and airports – and the production of fuel. The warming effects of different greenhouse gases happen over different time periods, from a few days of short intensive warming to centuries of gentle influence. In order to provide a common unit to measure the impact of different gases, warming effects are standardised over a given time period. The time period normally used is 100 years.  But if it were five years, the effect of contrails would account for more global warming than all the cars in the world. They raise the temperature of the atmosphere in short, intense bursts. On longer timescales, like 20 years, the short term effects are less important and make aviation look considerably better – with flying looking potentially less damaging than some cars over the same distance. This is still not the whole story though. The energy inputs for different modes of travel vary. The direct burning of fossil fuels in engines, for example jet kerosene in aircraft, emits greenhouse gases. In electrically powered high-speed rail, operating the train produces no emissions, except from the fossil fuels used to generate that electricity elsewhere.

      Electric cars won't save the planet without a clean energy overhaul – they could increase pollution


 Developing HS2 will mean deploying stations, tracks and centres of communication, and they’ll need ongoing maintenance. These all need energy and material investments, which will create further greenhouse gas emissions through manufacture, transport, and use. That could increase the carbon footprint of rail by between 1.8 and 2.5 times, over just accounting for the operation of the trains. For aviation, the same infrastructure requirements are relatively small, and are responsible for a 1.2–1.3 increase, with road transport showing a 1.4–1.6 increase. A life cycle approach gives a better understanding of where emissions are occurring and compares transport modes on a much more level playing field. This helps us understand that most greenhouse gas emissions in air and road travel come from flying and driving, whereas in rail travel, the climate effects are dominated by those emissions produced building the infrastructure itself. Emissions from operating trains are generally lower because of the heavy reliance on electricity. But there are still emissions from the manufacture and maintenance of renewable energy technologies to consider. All modes of high-speed travel come with a cost to the environment. Being able to accurately compare the energy requirements and emissions of different transport options is the first step towards addressing their climate impact. Governments often try to encourage people to change their behaviour and reduce the number of flights they take. But in the case of HS2, the continued availability of regional flights means that only 4% of drivers and only 1% of aeroplane passengers are likely to change their behaviour.  It’s easy to point the finger at aviation and view rail as a low carbon alternative. But governments need to consider and carefully balance the true climate impacts of a transport project, in every phase of its development."

“Snowshoe Hare, Shirleys Bay” by D. Gordon E. Robertson – Own work. Licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0 via Commons.
Guest essay by Eric Worrall
Snow hares – fluffy, cute, less likely to eat you than a Polar Bear. The ideal candidate for the next green icon, except for their distressing lack of rarity, and their unfortunate ability to adapt to changes in their environment.
Can Evolution Save Snow Hares From Climate Change?
Species go extinct unless they can adapt to changes to their environment. And while the climate change caused by humans is often viewed as a future threat to wildlife, it’s already having a measurable impact on species today.
One potential casualty of climate change is the snowshoe hare. A close relative of rabbits, the hare’s hind feet (its ‘snowshoes’) have a large surface area to stop it sinking into snow. It also has another adaptation for life in North America: the animal’s brown summer coat turns white in winter, providing camouflage to hide it from predators.
…
“This is one of the most direct demonstrations of mortality costs for a wild species facing climate change,” [L Scott] Mills said in a press release. And while snowshoe hares aren’t currently endangered, the biologists predict that the higher death rate will lead to a significant drop in population levels by the end of the century.
…
But the chances of extinction can be minimized by a conservation strategy called ‘evolutionary rescue’: if a population is made-up of a large variety of individuals, it will have a deep gene pool, maximizing the likelihood that at least some individuals carry a genetic variant that would help them to survive and reproduce. This would enable a population to adapt through natural selection. For hares, this means individuals with genes that make them molt at times which match snow cover (it’s unknown whether they would be able to adapt in time).
Read more: http://www.forbes.com/sites/jvchamary/2016/01/29/snow-hare-climate-change/
The abstract of Scott’s study;
Anthropogenic climate change has created myriad stressors that threaten to cause local extinctions if wild populations fail to adapt to novel conditions. We studied individual and population-level fitness costs of a climate change-induced stressor: camouflage mismatch in seasonally colour molting species confronting decreasing snow cover duration. Based on field measurements of radiocollared snowshoe hares, we found strong selection on coat colour molt phenology, such that animals mismatched with the colour of their background experienced weekly survival decreases up to 7%. In the absence of adaptive response, we show that these mortality costs would result in strong population-level declines by the end of the century. However, natural selection acting on wide individual variation in molt phenology might enable evolutionary adaptation to camouflage mismatch. We conclude that evolutionary rescue will be critical for hares and other colour molting species to keep up with climate change.

The main thrust of Scott’s point seems to be the need for a healthy, diverse population. But imagine if Scott’s findings apply to other species? Could it be possible, that species are capable of adapting to altered conditions, through natural selection, and that a couple of degrees of global warming isn’t quite the catastrophic threat we’ve been led to believe?

Why did a bare majority (219–212) of the members of the U.S. Congress vote for the largest tax increase in American history this past Friday, under the claim it was a vote to save the climate?



Before you answer the question, consider the following facts. The proponents claim this tax bill will reduce U.S. carbon dioxide emissions, which are purported to cause global warming. First, despite the claims of President Obama, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and many in the media, there is no consensus in the scientific community about how much climate change, other than the normal cycles, is taking place, nor how severe it will be, and how much man‐​made CO2 is responsible. None of the climate models predicted the unexpected global cooling of the last decade.



It is known that the legislation will have a negligible effect on global CO2 emissions, particularly since the big polluters, such as China and India, are not playing ball. It is also known that the “cap and trade” system that the legislation calls for has been a failure in Europe, where it has been in operation for the last few years, in that it has proven to be far more costly than envisioned, has not met the CO2 reduction targets, and has been highly susceptible to corruption and abuse.



In addition, because the legislation requires Americans to use more inefficient energy (wind and solar) sources, it cannot help but raise costs for American businesses and citizens, and hence will kill jobs rather than create them (as contrasted to what Mr. Obama and Mrs. Pelosi have incorrectly claimed).



In sum, serious people understand the legislation will hurt the U.S. economy, reduce the standard of living and yet not accomplish its claimed intent; therefore, why were so many members of Congress willing to vote for it?



Are they idiots, or do they have another agenda? Yes, a few are not that bright, but many more see this as an opportunity to extract wealth from one group of Americans, give it to other groups of Americans they favor, and to their political cronies who will reward them in campaign contributions and in other ways — both seen and unseen. They are willing to engage in more tax oppression in exchange for more political power to themselves.



The tendency for political leaders — even those fairly elected — to look out more for their own personal interests rather than the greater good is not confined to America. The Organization for Cooperation and Development (OECD), whose 30 members are the major industrialized democratic countries, was formed half a century ago to promote policies to increase economic growth and free trade.



Unfortunately, political leaders in high‐​tax states (notably France and Germany) have captured part of the OECD and are using it as an instrument — by creating “black” and “gray” lists — to squash tax competition from low‐​tax‐​rate countries and financial freedom and privacy (which are important for global economic growth).



A European economic policy organization, Institut Constant de Rebecque, has just published an important study, “Tax burden and individual rights in the OECD: an international comparison.” As part of the study, the author, Pierre Bessard, created a Tax Oppression Index by using OECD and World Bank data to measure the overall tax burden, public governance, and taxpayer rights. Italy and Turkey were judged to have the most tax oppression, while Austria, Luxembourg and Switzerland were judged to have the least oppressive tax systems. A sample of the major countries in the index can be seen in the accompanying table.



Those who advocate bigger governments and more repressive tax systems claim that the additional tax revenue is needed to promote the common good. In 2007, the government spending in Switzerland was equal to 35.7 percent of GDP (very close to the government share of GDP in the United States of 37.4 percent) while the Italians had a government sector equal to 48.5 percent of GDP.



The Italians and the Swiss share a long peaceful border, but Italy is far richer in natural resources and access to the sea than land locked Switzerland. Yet the Swiss are far more prosperous and do a much better job in delivering government services than do the Italians (or French with 52.4 percent of government spending) while, at the same time, engage in far less tax repression. The Austrian government spends 48.2 of its GDP, which is almost equal the size of the Italian government spending, but manages to raise the necessary tax money in a far less oppressive way.



The United States is in about the middle of the pack, but could have a lower score if it improved its public governance by reducing the corruption and inefficiency in Washington, and did a much better job in protecting taxpayer rights. (The U.S. Constitution explicitly gives citizens the presumption of innocence, but the Internal Revenue Service chooses to ignore the Constitution in this and many other matters.)



The world would be richer and more just if the low‐​tax‐​rate countries that protect taxpayer rights and privacy could penalize the states that engage in high levels of tax oppression, rather than vice versa, which is now the case.



The empirical evidence from the new Institut Constant study clearly shows (as have many other studies) that it is not necessary to have high tax rates or deny taxpayers basic rights and financial privacy for the government to obtain all of the revenue it legitimately needs. But as the vote on the “climate” (tax) bill in the Congress clearly showed last week, for all too many politicians, tax policy is not about revenue but political power and control.

"Species are being lost at about a thousand times the natural rate of extinction. This is faster than at any other period in human history. Ecosystems — the vital systems on which all life depends — are being degraded across the globe.  This crisis of biodiversity loss is finally getting some attention. But its connection to another loss – that of indigenous cultures – is rarely mentioned. From animals to insects and plants, biodiversity loss cannot be effectively addressed without tackling the rapid disappearance of indigenous cultures. The two are inextricably linked. Indigenous peoples have conserved biodiversity for millennia. They have created much of the world’s agricultural biodiversity, including thousands of crop varieties, livestock breeds and unique landscapes. These practices continue today in many of their territories, creating new varieties of crops and livestock that are often more resilient than modern equivalents. So it is unsurprising that the rich diversity of nature is declining less rapidly on indigenous peoples’ lands than in other areas. This clearly shows that the world’s 370 million to 500 million indigenous people play a critical role in conserving biodiversity. This is backed up by extensive research. According to several studies, traditional ecological knowledge is effective in conserving biodiversity and regulating sustainable resource use, including hunting, wild harvesting, fishing, farming and pastoralism, a form of animal husbandry. Living in harmony with nature is a fundamental part of indigenous peoples’ core values and beliefs. Similar ecological values and worldviews can be seen across indigenous cultures, from southern China to the Americas. Among Andean peoples, for example, the world is divided into three parts: the human and domesticated; the wild (species, ecosystems, water); and the sacred and ancestral. Rather than focusing on economic development, their goal is holistic wellbeing, which is achieved through balance between these three worlds. Yet across the world, indigenous cultures and practices are being eroded by modernisation, commercial development pressures, lack of secure rights to land and resources, migration and lack of cultural education. As a result, many are struggling to save their unique cultures, knowledge systems and identities from extinction. This is despite growing recognition that they hold the key to solving many of today’s environmental problems. Up to 80% of biodiversity is located on indigenous peoples’ lands, while at least a quarter of all land is traditionally owned or managed by indigenous peoples. Evidently, these cultures need to be protected. This should be part and parcel of broader tactics to conserve biodiversity. New biodiversity targets, for example, must protect indigenous cultures.

      Bolivia: contribution of indigenous people to fighting climate change is hanging by a thread


 Yet the role of indigenous peoples is poorly recognised in most biodiversity strategies and targets. Limited progress has been made on the Convention on Biological Diversity’s Aichi Target 18 since it was agreed in 2010, calling for traditional knowledge and customary use to be fully integrated into the convention’s implementation. Alarmingly, none of the Aichi Biodiversity Targets for 2020 are likely to be fully met. Only a few will see significant progress, largely due to the continuation of economic policies that drive biodiversity loss. A change in perspective is needed. In 2005, IIED, the sustainable development research institute where I work, and its partners developed a definition of biocultural heritage in order to address this dual extinction crisis. Our research with 11 indigenous groups in Peru, Panama, Kenya, India and China has revealed multiple interlinkages and interdependence between indigenous knowledge, biodiversity, landscapes, cultural and spiritual values and customary laws. These form key components of biocultural heritage, along with indigenous languages.  Consider the territory of Peru’s Potato Park, which is governed collectively by an association of five Quechua communities. The park shows how the biocultural heritage approach can achieve multiple conservation and development goals. The Potato Park has tripled potato diversity to about 650 native varieties, through the revival of Quechua culture and customary laws and a repatriation agreement with the International Potato Centre to restore native varieties. It has also led to conservation of Andean wildlife, crop diversity and water across 9,000 hectares. Potato diversification and collaborative research with scientists have enhanced yields despite severe climate change impacts. And landscape-based biocultural products and services, such as eco-tourism, a traditional restaurant, herbal teas, skin creams, potato shampoo and textiles, have doubled incomes. Key to this success has been the highly participatory, indigenous-led approach, supported by the NGO Asociaciόn ANDES. This approach has built strong community ownership and self-sustainability. My PhD explores whether and how the Potato Park model can be applied in different contexts. This research in northeast India, coastal Kenya and southwest China suggests that the model can be adapted to establish similar biocultural heritage territories in different socio-cultural, ecological and political contexts. In China, the Naxi people in the Stone Village, Yunnan have started to revive their unique crop diversity, culture and ancient terraced farming landscape, with support from the Centre for Chinese Agricultural Policy and the National Farmer Seed Network in China. The process will require the restoration of traditional beliefs, close collaboration with the local government and creativity to support the emergence of collective management in a centralised political system. What all this shows is that efforts to save the rich variety of nature cannot be achieved without working to save indigenous cultures. Governments must legally recognise and protect indigenous peoples’ rights to territories, natural resources, traditional knowledge and self-determination. And indigenous peoples must be fully and effectively involved at every level in efforts to save biodiversity.  This will be particularly important this year when the new global biodiversity targets are negotiated. Not only is this key to humankind living in harmony with nature. It is also vital for enhancing support for poor and marginalised indigenous peoples in order to achieve the UN 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. Measures to protect both biodiversity and indigenous cultures must be included across all of the sectors that are driving their loss, including agriculture, mining and forestry, if the diversity of life is to survive.

"The Concept is Similar to a Gambling Casino Based on Hot Air
ABA Chairman, Brad Bellinger said, “The ABA Board had met last week and decided to oppose any form of Emissions Trading. He said that the Australian Government will be acting like speculative fools, if it goes down a path of trading something that cannot be accurately measured.”

He continued, “Since the 1997 Kyoto Summit, we have seen the UN try to run a Clean Development Mechanism, – with no success. We have seen the European Commission try Carbon Permits. They got their sums wrong and the large power and oil companies made fortunes at governments’ expense. The people are taxed – as they will be in Australia if we go down this mad path.”
“We have seen the World’s bankers make complete fools of themselves and bankrupt millions, as they trade in derivatives, which they haven’t completely understood. Now, Emissions Trading will be even worse, as people trade an unmeasurable commodity, as if in a gambling casino run by the unknowing. To see it even considered as the recession deepens; – makes one wonder,” Mr Bellinger said.
Mr Bellinger said, “The members of ABA try to make a living from raising cattle in a harsh environment. They have their feet on the ground. They hold in contempt the speculative airheads who are pushing unscientific hot air drivel onto Australians. These people have already demonstrated their utter impracticality in their inability to even sort out our major water problems.
“ABA gives its full support to Barnaby Joyce and anyone else in Parliament who has the courage to point out the bleeding obvious – Emissions Trading is a con-act,” Mr Bellinger stated.

"The connection between your next flight and climate change is likely clear in your head. More aeroplanes emitting greenhouse gases means more global warming. Simple enough, but there’s an opposite side that you probably hadn’t thought of.  As the local climates at airports around the world have changed in the past few decades, the conditions that pilots have relied on in order to take off safely have changed too. Our new research suggests that higher temperatures and weaker winds are making take-off more difficult. In the long run, this means that airlines are delivering fewer passengers and cargo for the same amount of fuel. “Climate” essentially means the average weather conditions at any given place. Scientists know this is changing, but not uniformly. While global temperatures have risen by about 1°C on average, some places have warmed by much more already – and others may be getting cooler.  


      Read more:
      Travel the world without destroying it – Imagine newsletter #5


 But climate change isn’t just about temperature – winds are slowing down and changing direction around the world too. This is a problem for airport runways that were built many years ago to align with the prevailing winds at the time.  Research has predicted that take-off distances will get longer as the climate warms. This is because higher temperatures reduce air density, which the wings and engines need to get airborne. With reduced headwinds, aeroplanes also need to generate more groundspeed just to get into the air. Once they’re up there, they’re subject to in-flight turbulence, which is getting worse due to climate change increasing the energy in jet stream winds.  More than 100,000 aircraft regularly take off and land around the world each day. The record so far is 202,157, on June 29 2018. How are all these changes likely to be affecting them? With colleagues in Britain and Greece, we decided to look at what has happened so far.   We have been recording the weather at ten Greek airports since 1955. For each year, we took the average wind and overnight minimum temperatures, and then plugged that into performance graphs. These are used to calculate the safe runway lengths and aeroplane weights that are needed to ensure that airlines can carry their passengers safely. Temperature changes varied a lot between the airports we studied, between a 2°C and 5°C temperature rise over the 62 years we had data for. So did wind. At one airport, the average speed of wind passing down the runway towards the aeroplane as it took off (known as headwinds) increased by about 25%. At the other extreme, another airport saw average headwinds on the airport’s runway fall by 90% over 43 years.  We found that in every case the conditions had changed over the 62 years to make aeroplane take-off more difficult. Safety regulations ensure that aeroplanes are never allowed to take off without enough runway, but on the longer runways we studied, the take-off distances necessary to get a large jet plane into the air had increased by about 1.5% every decade, and about 1% for a smaller turboprop airliner.   In airports with shorter runways, aircraft have to reduce weight. This is all worked out before take-off – cargo, passenger numbers and fuel loads are adjusted accordingly. In the most extreme case we studied this meant that planes were taking off with one passenger fewer (or about 40 kilometres worth of fuel less) each year. These aeroplanes are climbing less steeply after take-off, creating more pollution and noise nuisance on the ground. We conducted this research in Greece, but other global studies have found similar trends elsewhere in the world. Small airports – such as those on islands off Scotland or in the Caribbean – are likely to suffer the most as the climate continues to change. That could mean that airlines must reduce the numbers of passengers they carry on flights, or search for ways to lengthen their runways. In some extreme cases, it could become impossible for some aeroplanes to use some airports altogether. This is another reminder of how rapidly and extensively human actions are transforming the world around us, and how ill equipped we are to deal with the consequences.

"The amount of carbon dioxide emitted by Arctic wildfires this year is already 35% higher than the figure for the whole of 2019. The latest data, provided by the EU’s Copernicus atmosphere monitoring service, shows that up to 24 August 245 megatonnes of CO2 had been released from wildfires this year. The figure for the whole of last year was 181 megatonnes.  The peak number of active fire observations was about 600 in late July, compared with 400 in 2019. The average equivalent number between 2003 and 2018 was about 100. Copernicus estimated that 205 megatonnes of CO2 was emitted between 1 June and 31 July alone. The wildfires coincided with a heatwave in Siberia, where temperatures soared to more than 30C (86F) in some areas. Dr Mark Parrington, senior scientist at Copernicus, said the Arctic wildfires this summer may be setting a new precedent. Emissions increased significantly in July and early August compared with 2019. “In some respects [the data] has been similar to 2019 in terms of the dry and warm conditions in the Siberian Arctic. This year, the difference was a large cluster of fires that burned through July for many days leading to higher estimated emissions.” Dr Thomas Smith, assistant professor in environmental geography at the London School of Economics, said 2019 had already been an anomalous year in the Arctic circle. “We have seen two years of anomalously high activity, according to the satellite record that goes back to 2003,” he said. Smith also warned that some fires were destroying ancient peat bogs containing carbon that has accumulated over thousands of years, a process similar to fossil fuel burning. Analysis performed by Smith, covering May and June of this year, suggested that about 50% of the fires in the Arctic Circle were burning on peat soils, with the vast majority of the fire activity occurring in eastern Siberia. Arctic wildfires have become a cause for concern in recent years, with fires becoming more widespread and persistent in 2019 and 2020. In June, Russia’s aerial forest protection service reported that 3.4m acres of Siberian forest were burning in areas unreachable to firefighters. Last summer, the Arctic fires were so intense that they created a cloud of smoke and soot bigger than the EU landmass."

Share this...FacebookTwitterCriticism and harsh words on Germany’s out-of-control renewable energy policy continues to mount and grow in volume as the energy sector approaches potential catastrophe.
Cologne’s online Kölner Stadt Anzeiger (KSta) here reports on a speech made by Germany’s former federal economics minister Wolfgang Clement on the subject of Germany’s green energy policy before the IGBCE-Angestelltengruppe Fortuna trade union group, which represents Germany’s once formidable mining, energy and chemicals sector. Clement earlier served as the country’s “super economics minister” under Gerhard Schroeder, from 2002–2005.
Energy policy “perversions”
The 76-year old socialist SPD party leader did not mince any words as he blasted Germany’s “perversions of its current energy policy” and “gigantic faulty developments” under the current government, led by Angela Merkel. What started as a reasonable shift over to renewable energies some 15 years ago has since morphed into a development that has totally run amok, the former federal minister described.
The current energy policy is marred by “unreasonableness and totally lacks basis” and is characteriszed by “a go-it-alone stoppage of nuclear energy” that he called “needless” because Germany faces no such catastrophe like the reactors at Fukushima.

“Capital destruction of difficult-to-fathom dimensions”
Clement told the audience “that with respect to cutting CO2 emissions, nuclear power in fact should be continued“, the online KStA writes. Later the former economics minister stated that the government got “carried away with the subsidies” for green energies. The KStA adds:
The ‘huge subsidies’ in the meantime cost consumers more than 23 billion euros annually’ and ‘especially lignite coal never needed such subsidies.'”
Clement blasted current energy policy for “putting climate protection too high above economy and supply stability” and that it is “a capital destruction of difficult-to-fathom dimensions”  He added that “it would be unthinkable in any other country on the planet.“ The KStA writes that the former super minister hopes for a “transition away from the energy transition” and that Germany’s Rhineland industrial belt survives.
He called on the trade unions “to fight with all their strength“.
The KStA writes that Clement’s call was greeted with great applause.

When Renae Maihi went to court, I couldn’t help but wonder where Don Brash, David Seymour and the free speech brigade were. Given that Brash and his “Free Speech Coalition” quickly rushed to court to defend Lauren Southern and what’s-his-face Molyneux’s right to free speech, I waited for them to run to the media to express absolute outrage at the defamation action against Maihi. I waited for them to launch a public fundraising effort to support her defence. I searched far and wide for their expressions of unwavering support.



That’s because neither Southern or Molyneux were attacking anyone’s reputation.



[…]Outspoken free speech advocates seemed strangely reserved last week when [Sir Robert] Jones and Maihi faced off in court. In my honestly held opinion, I can’t say I’m surprised.



Um, free speech doesn’t give anyone the right to attack someone’s reputation with impunity.



[…]It’s difficult to imagine a mechanism that has a more chilling effect upon free speech than defamation proceedings. And as for freedom of speech, if, as “Free Speech Coalition” member Chris Trotter wrote in a blog recently, “At the core of the free speech argument is the proposition that every citizen is obliged to uphold the right of every other citizen… to express their opinions freely and without the fear of any retribution beyond their opponents’ vigorous refutation,” then shouldn’t he, Brash and the entire so-called “coalition” have been at pains to defend Renae Maihi’s “right… to express [her] opinions freely and without the fear of any retribution beyond [her] opponent’s vigorous refutation”?



Let’s stop right here. Maihi has every right to call the great Sir Bob Jones a racist. But if in doing so, she harms his reputation then she has to pay for that harm. It’s not rocket science.



[…”]How much do we tolerate of ridiculous offence-taking?” Jones asked last week, whilst sitting in court because a young woman started a petition that he apparently never read but that nonetheless offended him so deeply that he launched proceedings against her.



It felt like theatre of the absurd. Jones voiced an opinion that offended Maihi, who in response voiced an opinion that offended Jones. And round and round we went.



If the great Sir Bob only sued because he got offended then, with all respect to the great Sir Bob, that was a mistake. But it doesn’t take much brain power to see that, as Sir Bob is a businessman who deals with people of different races, how being called a racist can be damaging.



[…]Whether Jones is racist or not (and I have some honestly held views about that) in a free society you are absolutely entitled to feel offended and outraged, and to express such feelings. You are also entitled to express stupid, offensive, controversial, morally-bereft, inane, badly written opinions. You are also, if you’re wealthy enough, entitled to go to court to ask it to give someone who’s hurt your feelings and written or said something not very nice about you a telling off. But just because we have these rights – to say stupid things, to express outrage, and to go to court – doesn’t mean it’s always wise, or indeed reputation-enhancing, to exercise them.



Actually no. You have no right to seek redress for hurt feelings, except for cases of intentional infliction of emotional distress. And that involves more than just being called a name.



Defamation is not about hurty feelings.



Funnily enough, in some ways, defamation legislation is one of the most significant threats to the freedom of expression. As legal commentator Graeme Edgeler recently [wrote](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12299280) for the Herald, “In theory, there are other laws that could more greatly impact freedom of expression in New Zealand, but defamation laws far exceed them in practice.” He went on to suggest that the courts should not be concerned with simple name-calling, because, “if your reputation can be harmed by someone calling you a name, your reputation may not have been as good as you thought it was”, and that “the outdated, restrictive defamation laws applying in New Zealand” should be changed “the sooner the better”.



Edgeler is of course right in that defamation is about reputation. But if a journalist has a reputation for honest and original writing and someone calls him a plagiarist, it’s easy to see that he has a good case for defamation.



And so I find myself waiting again, this time for our cherished free speech advocates to co-sign Edgeler’s missive. Otherwise, I can’t help but wonder whether some of those calling for “free speech” secretly just want to be able to say whatever they want without anyone being able to tell them that, in their honestly held opinion, they’re a dickhead for saying it.



This is the same as saying people who want drug law reform just want to be able to get high every day. No, what people who advocate for free speech want is to be able to say what we want without being arrested or deplatformed by the State. Which brings me to my final point.



Free speech is not concerned with the individual and other individuals. It’s about the individual and the State. I could submit a piece to a left-wing blog saying that man made climate change is bollocks and they have every right to not publish it (left-wing blogs tend to be a lot less tolerant of dissenting views than right-wing blogs). But if the government were to pass laws saying that those who question MSM made climate change could be arrested and thrown in jail, then we are talking about free speech.

"Gas-fired space heating accounts for around 720 terawatt hours (TWh) of energy consumption each year in the UK. That’s more than double the UK’s annual electricity consumption of around 350TWh. Burning all that natural gas isn’t sustainable, which is why the UK government announced in April 2019 that no new properties should be fitted with gas-fired boilers from 2025. Of the 25 million homes in the UK, over 23 million have a gas supply for heating and cooking. That accounts for about 60 million tonnes of CO₂ emissions each year. So how could the carbon footprint of the UK’s gas network be eliminated? One approach is to transform a network based on natural gas into one that uses hydrogen. The H21 project aims to swap out the methane burners in gas appliances, such as boilers, hobs and ovens, for hydrogen burners across the city of Leeds, to demonstrate that such a network is possible. Even though hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe, generating hydrogen gas that can power a boiler isn’t that simple. One option is to use electricity to split the water molecules to produce hydrogen gas. With (expensive) solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), this process can be up to 92% efficient. With affordable proton-exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells, the figure is more like 75%. Either way, for every 1,000 joules of electricity used to make hydrogen, less than 920 joules can be released by burning it. An alternative to burning fuels to heat homes is to use electricity. Electricity can be converted directly to heat with 100% efficiency using cheap resistive elements – the same parts that are present in fan heaters and oil-filled radiators. With this, every terawatt hour (TWh) that’s currently provided by gas heating could be replaced by exactly one TWh of electrical heating. Sounds ideal, but this would require huge upgrades to the electrical grid that are unrealistic in the few decades that we have to achieve decarbonisation.

      Despite good progress, 100% low-carbon energy is still a long way off for the UK


 Heat pumps are a better idea because they can typically achieve an “efficiency” of 400%. For every one kilowatt hour (kWh) of electricity used, you can get four kWh of useful heat into your house. The other 3 kWh of heat has to be drawn from somewhere. Heat pumps use electricity to extract the input heat from a nearby river or stream, from the ground or from the air itself. This is known as the “cold source”. The process of extracting heat works similarly to how refrigerators remove heat from the food that’s put into them. Few properties have convenient access to flowing water outside and ground-sourced heat pumps need water to be circulated through a closed loop well below the ground surface. The loop can be installed vertically in a borehole or spread horizontally beneath a garden, but retrofitting these on homes is difficult. There is another alternative. Rather than delivering natural gas to homes, the gas network would deliver water from which domestic heat pumps could extract heat. Water is, after all, never scarce in the UK at the coldest times of year. A house could take in water, extract heat from the water so that it forms ice slurry and dump the slurry down the drain where it would melt again. On the coldest days in winter, the average UK home uses up about 160 kWh of heating energy each day – equivalent to having two big electric kettles turned on continuously.  By slightly modifying existing heat pumps, you could extract 120 kWh of heat in a day from cold water by making about one 1.35 tonnes (1,350 kg) of ice slurry. A further 40 Wh of electricity put into the special heat pump would make up the required total of 160 kWh of heat. As housing insulation standards improve, this number will reduce. Instead of using drinking water, water drawn from rivers and collected rainwater runoff could be distributed through the existing gas network to houses. That water would be stored in tanks at convenient points in the network, and could also replace the drinking water that’s currently used to flush toilets. Some of the water turned into ice slurry could be the “grey water” from the house itself – the outflows from showers, baths, dishwashers and washing machines. But would Britain’s gas network be up to the task of transporting water? The flow rates needed for this to work aren’t high. Making even two tonnes of ice slurry per day requires a steady flow of less than 25ml each second. It would take 30 seconds to fill a wine bottle at that rate. The pipes used for gas supply are at least 22mm wide. In these, the average water velocity for a flow of 25ml per second would be less than 75mm per second – about one-twentieth of a normal walking pace.  The drainage system should have little trouble accommodating this either. The extra water burden of a renovated gas network is still much smaller than what might fall as rain on a typical day. If rain is falling, the air temperatures cannot be much below 0°C and rainwater from the house roof could itself provide much or all of the cold source.  Houses could also gather heat from the sun. Solar thermal collectors are less commonly installed than photovoltaic panels but in the future, homes could use them to gather the same amount of electricity as normal solar panels, but also collect some heat. Perhaps the gas network that has served Britain so well for decades has a surprising future. It would be quite a turnaround to no longer heat our homes with the help of an expensive and finite fossil fuel, but with rainwater – something we’ll never run out of during the winter in the UK.

"**China has suspended visits by US Navy ships and aircraft to Hong Kong after Washington passed legislation last week backing pro-democracy protesters.**
Beijing also unveiled sanctions against a number of US human rights groups.
It comes after President Donald Trump signed the Human Rights and Democracy Act into law.
The act orders an annual review to check if Hong Kong has enough autonomy to justify special trading status with the US.
President Trump is currently seeking a deal with China in order to end a trade war.
The foreign ministry said it would suspend the reviewing of applications to visit Hong Kong by US military ships and aircraft from Monday - and warned that further action could come.
""We urge the US to correct the mistakes and stop interfering in our internal affairs,"" ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters in Beijing.
""China will take further steps if necessary to uphold Hong Kong's stability and prosperity and China's sovereignty.""
Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) targeted by sanctions include Human Rights Watch, Freedom House, the National Endowment for Democracy, the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs and the International Republican Institute.
""They shoulder some responsibility for the chaos in Hong Kong and they should be sanctioned and pay the price,"" Ms Hua said, without specifying what form the measures would take.
Several US Navy ships usually visit Hong Kong every year, although visits are sometimes suspended when ties between the two countries become strained.
The USS Blue Ridge, the amphibious command ship of the US Seventh Fleet, was the last American navy ship to visit Hong Kong, in April.
Mass protests broke out in the semi-autonomous territory in June and Chinese officials accused foreign governments, including the US, of backing the pro-democracy movement.
In August China rejected requests for visits by the guided missile cruiser USS Lake Erie and transport ship USS Green Bay, but did not give specific reasons.
In September last year, China refused a US warship entry to Hong Kong after the US imposed sanctions over the purchase of Russian fighter aircraft.
And in 2016, China blocked the nuclear powered aircraft carrier USS John C Stennis, and its escort ships, amid a dispute over China's military presence in the South China Sea.
Michael Raska, a security expert at Singapore's Nanyang Technological University, said that from a military point of view the US would not be affected by the latest ban ""as they can use many naval bases in the region"".
However, it sends a signal that US-China tensions will continue to deepen, he told AFP news agency.
Protesters celebrated on the streets of Hong Kong after President Trump signed the act last week.
However, China quickly warned the US it would take ""firm counter-measures"".
The new law requires Washington to monitor Beijing's actions in Hong Kong. The US could revoke the special trading status it has granted the territory if China undermines the city's rights and freedoms.
Among other things, Hong Kong's special status means it is not affected by US sanctions or tariffs placed on the mainland.
The bill also says the US should allow Hong Kong residents to obtain US visas if they have been arrested for being part of non-violent protests.
Analysts say the move could complicate negotiations between China and the US to end their trade war.
The bill was introduced in June in the early stages of the protests in Hong Kong, and was overwhelmingly approved by the House of Representatives in October.
Hong Kong - a British colony until 1997 - is part of China under a model known as ""one country, two systems"".
Under this model, Hong Kong has a high degree of autonomy and people have freedoms not seen in mainland China.
However, months of protests have caused turmoil in the city.
Demonstrations began after the government planned to pass a bill that would allow suspects to be extradited to mainland China.
The bill was eventually withdrawn but unrest evolved into a broader protest against the police and the way Hong Kong is administered by Beijing."

English Translation provided by the Hungarian Government



Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I am extremely fortunate not to be delivering a state of the nation address in the Hungary of one hundred years ago. I say this because this year is the centenary of the Trianon peace diktat. One hundred years ago the Hungarian prime minister’s name was Károly Huszár. If he had given a state of the nation address, he would have had to say that we had suffered tremendous loss of life in the Great War, in which not a single family was spared. Together with our allies, we came out of the hostilities on the losing side.



The Austro-Hungarian Monarchy – which provided the state framework for our lives – had been destroyed. He would have had to say that peace in society had come to an end and that the life-force of the Hungarians was being consumed by a state of civil war. The communist putsch delivered the coup de grâce. There were all kinds of experiments here: a constitutional monarchy, a people’s republic and a communist Soviet republic.



One hundred years ago all that the prime minister could have told his audience was that none of these had worked. In fact, we had reached the point, we had sunk so deep, that our enemies were watering their horses wherever they chose on the streets of Budapest. And if the unfortunate prime Minister had been able to see into the future, he would have had to say that within just four months the diktat ending the war would be proclaimed.



Not only did this diktat end the First World War, it also ended the era of Hungarian history leading up to it. The diktat saw two-thirds of the country’s territory and 63 per cent of its population shorn from us; thus one in three Hungarians found themselves outside our borders. The verdict was obviously a death sentence. History has not recorded a nation that could survive such a loss of blood. Those responsible for the decision were versed in history, and delivered their verdict in the light of that knowledge.



Count Apponyi, who led the Hungarian delegation in negotiations, was right to say that Hungary’s grave had been dug. The loss was devastating in itself, but even more traumatic – if that were possible – was the fact that state formations such as Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia were being constructed around us. Indeed, as if all this were not enough, the diktat after the Second World War made the Soviet Union one of our neighbours to the east: “Hello, I see you’ve got a limp,” as the joke goes, “Here’s a hump for your back as well.”



Enemies all around us. This meant political quarantine, economic isolation, debilitated national defence, cultural solitude and spiritual loneliness. So we hunkered down and set our sights on survival. We knew we had to wait: wait until the enemy state formations weakened, and the key was duly given to us. This is what happened. **Legend has it that one hundred years ago Apponyi also said that although Hungary’s grave had been dug, we Hungarians would be there at the funerals of our gravediggers.**



And indeed with our own eyes we saw the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, the disintegration of Yugoslavia and the dismantling of the Soviet Union. Today, one hundred years after the Trianon death sentence, I can tell you that we are alive and that Hungary still exists. And not only are we alive, but we have escaped from the grip of the surrounding circle of enemies. Instead of Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, we now have Slovaks, Slovenians, Croatians and Serbs.



Surprisingly, I see that, together with Slovakia, Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia on re-established national foundations, we can find a common voice and broad cooperation. We can even form alliances.



History has once again given the peoples of Central Europe the opportunity to build a new system of alliances **based on their own national interests.** Thus they have the ability to protect themselves from threats approaching from both the East and the West. How have we been able to withstand this one hundred years? **How were we able to find a way out of this hopeless situation?** There is an answer to this question: a short sentence that for hundreds of years has aided us, and which has been passed down by every generation to the next. As a prime minister of Hungary, after one hundred years, I can say nothing other than this: **“I believe in one homeland.”**



Ladies and gentlemen, after an anniversary of one hundred years, an anniversary of ten years: we also have a tenth anniversary. **Ten years ago people put an end to the nightmare of socialist governance** , and the national government began its work. People’s hopes and despair were brought together to produce the two-thirds election victory of 2010. **The country was on the verge of bankruptcy** and trapped in the International Monetary Fund’s life-support machine. Unemployment was sky-high, families were burdened with debt, and foreign-currency debtors were virtually underwater – if that could be described as water. Despair was more than justified.



But of course there was also hope: hope that can fill us with spirit, that can enable us to rally, that can dispel our sense of decline and the worthless philosophy that things can only get worse; hope that convinces us we can find the upward path and that Hungary will once again be a byword for what is fine, and that it will be worthy of its former glory.



We cannot know how many were desperate and how many were hopeful, but perhaps that does not matter when the flood is approaching. In such times what is important is to convince people not to give up, but to take action, and to believe that there is a point in renewed effort and mustering their remaining strength. This is the secret of all crisis management.



In my decades in politics, I have observed that every success story – the success story of every rising nation – **begins with the strengthening of self-esteem**. Just think of the two most recent Western examples: **Trump’s America** and the success of **Boris Johnson.** And I have also noticed that the personal self-esteem of citizens in a troubled country can only return together with that of their nation. So **the key to upward progress is the restoration of national self-esteem.**



So in 2010 we set ourselves the goal of proving to ourselves – and, of course, to the world – that we are still somebody, and not the people we seemed to be, anxiously cowering as we pleaded for IMF loans and EU money. The programme was simple. It was to reveal who we really are, to show that we are the Hungarians: **with one thousand years of Christian statehood, monumental cultural achievements, a dozen Nobel prizes, 177 Olympic gold medals, a sublimely beautiful capital city, superb technical and IT professionals and a rural Hungary blessed with agrarian genius.**



We thought that we would either find our path or create one. And as we saw that the paths marked out for us by Brussels and Washington were not viable, we were forced to create a new one. Ten years ago I thought that a people who had invented Rubik’s Cube could also figure out how to solve a seemingly hopeless crisis.



In all modesty, ten years later I can say that we did indeed figure it out, we managed to do it. We took a deep breath, laid the foundations, and **finally we had a Christian, national constitution.** We thank our president in that constitutional process, Pál Schmitt! God preserve you – vivat, vivat, vivat! We sent the IMF packing, we repaid the money they lent us before the due date, we **created 850,000 jobs** , we put an **end to freeloading** , we put our finances in order, we **gave workers respect and appreciation, families received recognition, large families received enhanced recognition, we launched the unification of the nation, and we connected Hungarian communities across the borders with the motherland.** And in the economic reports published this week in Brussels, the whole of Europe can read that **the entire continent’s fastest-growing economy in 2019 seems to have been that in Hungary.**



For ten years we have been debating how to evaluate the economic and social model that we have built in Hungary: it’s been called illiberal, post-liberal, Christian Democrat, a “democtatorship”, an authoritarian and hybrid system, and goodness only knows what else. No wonder commentators are so vexed, because a convent like our state system cannot be found anywhere else in Europe today – perhaps only in Poland.



They refuse to accept that in this part of the world, dispensing with liberal theorising, **we can derive our freedom from three simple Christian laws:** we have acquired the ability to distinguish between good and bad; God has created all of us in His own image, so we are all equal – regardless of origin and skin colour; and Christianity teaches us to do unto others as we would have them do unto us.



 **Europe has forgotten that the world of political freedom can be built from these laws.** What has happened and is happening in Hungary cannot be expressed in the liberal language of Brussels Eurobabble. In Brusselese it cannot be said that the Hungarians have not only taken their axe to a big tree, but to a primeval forest, and have managed to make their way out of it. With an IMF brain one cannot understand that we summoned up the courage to resist, even though we were in the grip of international capital, the banks had a stranglehold on us, we were drowning in debt, and international financial experts in sharp suits were demanding austerity measures from us.



With a Brussels or Washington mentality, it is not even conceivable that on the EU’s eastern border there is a down-at-heel country on its knees, accounting for only about 2 percent of the entire European Union, which still declares that there is something that it won’t have: austerity. Instead it declares that there will be a Hungarian way of life, tax cuts, production instead of debt, work instead of welfare benefits, enterprise instead of sharp practice, a patriotic economy instead of globalist wheeler-dealing, national identity and character instead of servility, and Hungarian children instead of migrants.



Looking back now this was more than risky, and was a bold adventure at the very least; but we could also call it Hungarian bravura. Today I see that the key to success was that the Government was not left to its own devices – probably because we never ruled over the heads of the people, we never ignored them, but we found a way to act together with them. This is called governance based on national consultation.



 **Nobody believed us, and they wouldn’t have bet a penny on us.** Instead, there was malicious mockery and doom-mongering scorn. The loudest prophets of doom were those who led the country towards bankruptcy before 2010. Interestingly, **Hungary was led to bankruptcy by a government of former communists pursuing liberal policy.**



This example strengthens the conviction that in fact there is no such thing as a liberal: **a liberal is nothing more than a communist with a university degree.** If we had taken their advice, right now Hungary would be in the intensive care ward, with the tubes of IMF and Brussels credit attached to every limb. And the fingers on the valves regulating the flow of credit would belong to **George Soros**. This is no exaggeration. I’ve been plying the craft of politics for more than thirty years now, and with my own eyes I’ve seen George Soros attempt to plunder Hungary on three separate occasions.



The first time was in the early nineties, when he wanted to buy up all the country’s state debt: all of Hungary’s state debt in the hands of one person, the fate of every Hungarian in the hands of George Soros. It’s spine-chilling even thinking about the situation we managed to avoid. Gratitude and recognition are due to József Antall for preventing this from happening. And I remember 1994, when Soros wanted to plunder us a second time. He tried to acquire OTP Bank, which was then the uniquely dominant Hungarian retail bank. No less spine-chilling is the vision of almost every Hungarian’s money in the hands of one person. Gratitude and recognition are due to Gyula Horn for not allowing that to happen. Today the soaring success of OTP is proof that he was right to do so.



Even young people can remember the third attempt. In 2015, **people-smuggling networks disguised as human rights organisations** brought hundreds of thousands of migrants to the Hungarian border. And when Europe was already straining under the weight of migration, Soros announced that he was ready to offer credit to finance the settlement of one million migrants a year. Please bear in mind that the Soros Plan, the planned settlement of foreign population groups, is still on the agenda: the operation is in progress and **we must man the defences** , stoutly and unwaveringly.



Young audience members, for you all this is history. I also realise that over the past ten years a generation has come of age which doesn’t know the meaning of the word “austerity”. A generation has come of age not knowing the Balatonöszöd Speech, the police attack, or having people’s eyes shot out. When young people hear the words “Nokia box” they only think of a telephone – or perhaps not even that. Ten years ago our aim was for our children and grandchildren not to have to come face to face with these abominations. **But we have to talk about them, because someone who has never seen a bear will not be afraid of one;** and if one day one comes up to you, you won’t know what to do. It’s as well to know that the bear isn’t a cuddly toy.



Dear friends, we have literally been through this whole period of ten years together. If my calculations are correct, we’ve used eight national consultations to decide on the most important issues. Together we’ve agreed on the Constitution, reductions in household utility bills, social questions, the banking tax, family support, and **rejection of the Soros Plan**.



Those who want to lecture us on democracy should first show us something even resembling our national consultation. By now we are almost used to the fact that **anyone in politics today who doesn’t dance to the tune played by the liberals will immediately be branded a populist.** This is a new version of the term “class enemy”. But, dear friends, a populist is someone who makes promises to the electorate that he knows he cannot keep. **Those who make promises and keep them are not populists, but democrats.** And we Hungarians should not hesitate to place our selves in that category.



We are now preparing for another national consultation. We are again irresistibly drawn back to this. For decision-makers in Europe the rights of violent criminals have taken precedence over those of law-abiding people. They make a mockery of justice and the sound instincts of honest people, and defend perpetrators instead of victims. This dangerous phenomenon has also reached Hungary. We can expect intense debates and international trials of strength related to this. Therefore we must once again arrive at points of consensus so that the Government has a base to stand on and something firm under foot.



Foreign-funded – and, of course, Soros-affiliated – organisations and their hired lawyers are abusing legal protection to launch a host of lawsuits in order to extract large sums of money from Hungarians and make pay-outs to violent criminals – and, of course, to themselves. This plethora of lawsuits – twelve thousand of them – is costing billions of forints. We can no longer look on passively, and so we are launching another national consultation.



Ladies and gentlemen, I do not want to leave the stage without speaking about the Gyöngyöspata case. We are talking about one of Hungary’s beautiful and attractive small towns and the people who live there, to whom I send my greetings. In that town about 20 percent of the population are Hungarians of Roma origin, living alongside a majority of 80 percent.



A court ruling citing segregation has stirred up public opinion by awarding large sums of money to some Roma residents. Furthermore, this money would need to be paid from local government funds, which cannot provide such an amount. And so this would bankrupt the entire town. This is happening at a time when Roma families – or many of them, at least – are embarking on a change in their way of life.



We cannot speak dispassionately about the great change represented by the fact that tens of thousands of Roma families have taken up offers of work, and that after working in public works schemes tens of thousands of them are making headway in the private sector. They are living off the proceeds of their work instead of welfare benefits, they are raising their children properly, and they have thus earned recognition from all of us. Their children are attending kindergarten from the age of three, something which prepares them for school and gives them the chance of keeping up with their peers from more advantageous backgrounds.



It is well known that the Government has openly committed itself – and I also see this as my personal responsibility – to eradicating poverty in Hungary. We have therefore also committed ourselves to the advancement of Roma families. Indeed we have also succeeded in establishing consensus across society on this point. This court ruling, which has once again set the people of Gyöngyöspata at odds with one another, has struck this promising process like a bolt of lightning.



I hardly need to say that George Soros is also financing the organisation initiating these court proceedings. As you can see, nothing is a coincidence. I want to make it clear that we shall not allow ourselves be distracted from our goal. We continue to believe in a Hungary which is a safe home for all Hungarians, and which gives everyone the opportunity to live a good life. We continue to reject the notion that origin or ethnicity should be a stigma or disadvantage, or that conversely it should confer any advantage or privilege. And **to receive money everyone –regardless of origin – must work.**



Ladies and gentlemen, this centenary and tenth anniversary encourage people to project the two periods on each other. What does the past ten years look like when embedded in the past one hundred years? When I made that comparison, I became nervous about what I was going to say. I was anxious that what I need to say to you, to the honourable Hungarian public, would simply not be believed.



People would think that I was shamelessly blowing my own trumpet. But this is not about me. It’s not even about the Government, but the performance of Hungary as a whole. And so I have chosen to tell the unusual truth. It’s a thankless enterprise, as history is history and culture is culture, and ultimately this is what shapes the attitude of peoples.



Hungarians have lost the habit of seeing themselves as a successful people. Hobo [the Hungarian blues singer]was right: we were down for so long that we don’t know what it means to be up. And when at last after much struggle we get to a higher place, we don’t believe reality – or even our own eyes. When we can no longer avoid calling success, development and record highs by their names, then of course we add that these are only temporary and lack solid foundations – and are in fact not due to us, but to external circumstances. In this we are inexhaustible and invincible.



Lord, what a rapturous speech the American President could base on the following sentence, which I say with caution – and even trepidation. The facts show that the past ten years were the most successful decade in the past one hundred years of Hungarian history. So instead of rapturous rhetoric and rapturous enthusiasm, let’s hold true to the Hungarian style, to the emotionless world of cold facts.



Longer periods of growth are rare in the history of our country. But since 2010, economic performance has grown at an average annual rate of 2.8 percent – and since 2013, after the crisis management period, at 3.8 percent a year. Earlier we could only achieve such growth with foreign debt. But the growth of the past ten years has occurred while maintaining external and internal fiscal balance: current account surpluses, fiscal discipline and a declining rate of government debt.



In summary, sustained growth alongside external and internal balance has not been characteristic of any other decade in the last hundred years of our history. All of this has happened with wealth inequalities remaining moderate by European standards, so that the benefits of growth have been spread across a wide section of society. Vulnerable groups – young people, those over the age of 50, women with children, and the relatively unqualified – have been able to find employment.



Wages have also started to rise, with the minimum wage and the guaranteed minimum wage for skilled workers doubling. For fans of economic statistics, wealth inequality in Hungary is the lowest in the entire European Union: in Germany and Austria the difference is 79 percent, while in Hungary it is only 45 percent. The policy of general tax reduction has therefore been a success, with a rising tide lifting all boats.



Ladies and gentlemen, we have reason to marvel if we add to all this the fact that in 2019 decisions on investments reached an all-time high: 101 large investments worth HUF 1,700 billion. And 60 percent of the value of these investments has come from the East. In this we see the meaning of the policy of Eastward Opening. To this we can add that in 2019 we broke our export record.



Around the world there are 35 countries capable of generating exports of over $100 billion, and we are among that 35. We are ranked 94th in the world in terms of population, but 34th in terms of exports. In the world rankings for exports we’re in third position in seed production, fifteenth in grain production, seventeenth in livestock production, eighteenth in pharmaceutical production and twentieth in car manufacturing. I repeat: in the world rankings!



 **This has been achieved by a country of ten million people.** Is there any clearer evidence of talent and hard work? What I’m prompted to note here is that we could see more moderation from those who are scathing in their criticism of Hungarian teachers, and the quality of our education and vocational training.



The workers, professionals and engineers operating state-of-the-art factories here in Hungary all come from our schools and universities. Let’s show more respect for Hungarian workers and Hungarian engineers! Not to mention teachers. I know that many people are concerned about the relatively high share represented by the automotive industry in Hungary, and the questions hanging over the future of that industry. I want to reassure everyone that Hungary is already part of the new era in the automotive industry, with significant capacities here for the future production of electric vehicles.



Ladies and gentlemen, we’ve learned a lot over the past ten years. This is valuable knowledge, and we’ve sweated for it. For example, we’ve learned that **a country cannot be taken seriously and cannot have national self-esteem without a national army.** How can a country be proud of itself if it cannot defend itself? We need a strong, modern army that can halt attacks from our surroundings, fulfil its obligations anywhere in the world, and link us to a major alliance system in times of global turmoil.



Technology is important, weaponry is important and military diplomacy is important. But most important of all is the soldier: we need good soldiers and good officers. This is why I am pleased that the officers with us here have accepted my invitation today. Welcome! Everyone can see that the Hungarian army has returned. I ask you to make sure that soldiers are not only present at party events, but also at governmental and civilian meetings, and that they occupy their respected place in Hungarian life.



Let it be as it was long ago. We also learned that Europe is not in Brussels. Europe is us, and we do not have to measure up to the tired Brussels elite, who will soon be disillusioned even with themselves. **We used to think that Europe was our future; today we know that we are the future of Europe.** We have learned that threats of a caning from Brussels are not the end of the world. We have learned that we can withstand far more than we once thought we could. We can withstand much more because today the Carpathian Basin radiates strength. This strength stems from the realisation that being Hungarian is something good, uplifting and full of promise.



We no longer sit in rapt wonder at every kind of liberal folk-tale about the self-regulating market, good capitalism, the European Union and the beautiful world order. We live in our own way, according to our own rules and our own decisions. Our nation knows this: Hungary comes first. Those who dispute this need to tell us what on earth comes first, if not Hungary? There is no sensible answer to this, so let’s be satisfied with the fact that Hungary comes before all else.



Ladies and gentlemen, so this looks quite good. It is understandable that there are some who call this the Golden Age. But I have bad news for them: that time has not yet come. In fact, looking forward to the years ahead, we have cause for concern. I see the arrival of particularly dangerous years – including 2020, the present year. **We need to take serious action to protect what we have already achieved.** And if we don’t want to be forced onto the back foot – but want to continue to progress, develop and resume our ascent – our efforts must show soldierly grit. We are threatened by the climate crisis, by demographic decline and by sinister shadows gathering over the European economy. Instead of talking about a golden age, today **I need to sound the alarm.**



Ladies and gentlemen, the climate crisis is not a new issue. Hungarians are well aware of this. This is most of all thanks to President of Hungary János Áder, who has tirelessly fought against apathy and indifference. We have finally reached an agreement in Brussels: we are aiming for the European economy to be carbon-free by 2050. This is difficult, but it is possible in Hungary as well.



It is also true that 2050 is a long way off, and politicians have never been so poor that they haven’t been able to make promises – especially when no one knows where they will be in 2050. Climate protection has become a political fashion, and a lot of empty talk is tarnishing the gravity of the matter. If we truly fear for our land, our natural environment and our climate, then it is time to act and not simply talk.



When I talk about climate change, I do so not only as prime minister, but also as the father of five children – and indeed as a grandfather. I mention this because I am annoyed by the stupidity of those who seek to portray children as a danger to the climate. I’ve read that there are some who preach that the most effective way of saving the planet is to not have children. This is complete insanity! **Yes, let’s save the earth, but if we have no children or grandchildren who are we saving it for?**



Our Constitution also says that we bear a responsibility for future generations, and that is why we must protect the wonderful ecology of the Carpathian Basin. To put it bluntly, protecting the climate and nature is truly our Christian and patriotic duty. I can inform you that this week the Government has adopted a climate action plan. We have designed a programme to reach 90 percent carbon-neutrality for energy production in Hungary by 2030.



This also shows that we believe that in 2030 we will still be the people being held to account. On July 1 we will begin to eliminate illegal landfills and punish the polluters. Within two years we want to be able to show you a clean, orderly and well-kept country. We are banning the sale of disposable plastics and facilitating the return and recycling of glass and plastic bottles and metal cans. Thirdly, we will protect our rivers from waste coming from outside the country. We are already running a pilot programme, and the results are encouraging.



As I see it, we will be able to remove all plastic from the Danube and Tisza rivers. We will take strong action against multinational companies operating in Hungary, requiring them to use environmentally friendly technologies. In parallel with this, over the next two years we are providing SMEs with funding of HUF 32 billion for renewable energy production. We will plant ten trees for every new-born baby. This will translate into one million new trees per year, and so by 2030, we will have increased the country’s forest cover by 27 percent. Sixthly, over the next ten years we will increase the capacity of solar power plants, which will not only be environmentally friendly, but will also provide cheap energy for Hungarians. The seventh point is that electric cars will not only be the preserve of the rich, as we will support the introduction and use of affordable electric cars.



From 2022 onwards, new buses in our towns and cities must be electric. And finally, like the Poles, we are introducing green government bonds. Whoever buys such a bond will be supporting climate protection, because the Government will undertake to spend the money it raises through this only on climate-friendly programmes. Let us take action, instead of simply whining! This is my advice to Hungary.



Ladies and gentlemen, at this point one year ago I announced the **Family Protection Action Plan.** Now I shall report on the results in the language of numbers. First, let’s be modern and “sexy”: according to Google Analytics – such a thing exists – the tenth most popular internet search term was “baby-planning credit”. More than one hundred thousand people have received these loans. Interestingly, around 33 percent of the recipients of allowances for those awaiting children live in small towns, 29 per cent in villages, 21 per cent in provincial cities, and only around 18 per cent in the capital.



This also shows that we still have spare capacity. Dealers are having difficulty meeting the demand for large family cars. The construction of crèches is going ahead at full steam, with ten new infants’ places being added every working day. Income tax exemption for mothers with four children has also begun. This is making life easier for 40,000 families.



Although not included in the Family Action Plan, one step forward has been taken – or even two steps – in the fight against infertility: the state has purchased private companies treating infertility. This is also justified on the grounds of bioethical considerations related to embryos. But the most important thing was to make examinations and interventions – and even medicines – freely available to all. Today public service providers can serve everyone who turns to them. And important steps have been taken for parents caring for children with extreme dependency and for families with diabetic children.



It is also good news that between 2010 and 2018, 90,000 more children were born than would have been if the trend leading up to 2010 had continued. More good news is that the number of marriages has surged upwards, and the number of divorces has never been so low. The number of miscarriages is steadily declining, and is at a historic low.



The bad news is that the population decline has not stopped: **Hungarians are still an endangered species.** In 2010, 60 percent of parents’ preferred number of children were born, and although ten years later this figure has risen to 70 percent, there is apparently still a financial deterrence. A child is not a question of money, but money still matters. If we really want to make a difference, we need to cross the Rubicon: we need to build a country in which those making the commitment to have children are financially better off than if they had chosen not to have children.



Dear friends, we know what we need to do to achieve this, but we just don’t know if we will have the money to do so in the coming years. Either way, I’m determined – and I’m even trying to win over the Minister of Finance. I know that sooner or later mothers with three children – as well as those with four children– must be exempted from personal income tax. I also know that today mothers receive 70 percent of their previous year’s average earnings in the first six months after they have given birth to a child, and that this should be raised to 100 percent, and then they would receive more money in the first six months following childbirth than they would have if they had not given birth.



I also know that we have successfully introduced free language examinations and free driving tests for young people, and that this should be extended to mothers on maternity leave, so that they can gain the skills that they can use later in their work. Today these are just intentions, Ladies and Gentlemen. They may be commendable and vital to our future, but we must cut our coat according to our cloth. This will be especially true in 2020 – and, unfortunately, in the decade ahead. But we commit ourselves to making gradual but unwavering progress



Ladies and gentlemen, and finally the sting in the tail, the ominous shadows, or the bird of doom that haunted our childhoods: it seems that the European economy – and particularly the economy of the eurozone – has come to a halt. If it grows at all in 2020, that growth will be microscopic. We could casually dismiss this as their problem, saying that they didn’t worry too much when we were floundering in crisis. The problem with that attitude – apart from its lack of class – is that some 85 percent of Hungarian goods are exports to those countries. That’s where we make our sales, or that’s where they buy from us. So their problem is also our problem.



The only question is how much of a problem it will be for us. Looking at the economic data for 2019, at first I couldn’t believe my eyes: Germany’s industrial production declined significantly, while Hungary’s increased by 5 percent. This is a difference of at least 7 points in our favour. As an aside, in Bern in 1954 [in the World Cup Final]just one would have been enough. In 2020 we will face a true intellectual and economic policy challenge. Will the Hungarian economy be able to grow if the EU economy stagnates? Can our paths diverge, as they did in 2019, as they did last year? And if so, for how long, for how many years?



What processes will this trigger in the Hungarian economy, and what impact will it have here on people’s lives? And, dear friends, it is a matter of particular concern that in the West unemployment has also begun to increase. As I see it, in 2020 – and perhaps even in the following years – we will have to concentrate our efforts on preserving jobs. If there is work, there is everything – this law will definitely not be superseded. We know that at times like this we must reduce taxes. This has already proved successful, and this is what we are preparing to do now: we will reduce the taxes on small businesses and on employment.



And you can also rest assured that, no matter how much turmoil there is in Europe, we will preserve the value of pensions, as this is what we’ve agreed with seniors. But do we have enough financial room for manoeuvre, and will this be enough on its own – especially as European national economies are about to dive headlong into an economic world order with technology based on digitalisation and artificial intelligence?



In plain Hungarian, we will have to simultaneously preserve jobs and modernise them. Furthermore, today Europe is at a disadvantage compared with the other giants. In the US and China there is higher growth, lower unemployment, and they’re spending more on the growth-generating areas of innovation and defence. By contrast, Europe has been unable to muster military capabilities, tech giants with the ability to shape the future, or a civilisational mission. The other great powers understand that, whether we like it or not, competition in the world is unceasing. Europe appears to want to drop out of the competition, however. It also wants to restrict competition within the EU in the fields of taxation, employment and services.



Sometimes I have the feeling that people in the West have learned nothing from our history, and **fail to understand that socialism destroys nations.** If we don’t want Europe to be swept aside, we will have to create cooperation among EU Member States, so that – in competition with one another – they can bring out the best in themselves. If Hungary, the Hungarian system of taxation, the Hungarian social system and the Hungarian labour market were regulated within the economic order of a United States of Europe – as the opposition here at home proposes – then our economic growth would also come to a halt. Our economic structure would become rigid, and instead of integration and growth we would enter a period in which we were treading water. Dear friends, this is why we must also be cautious in the matter of joining the eurozone. I advise that we do not board a train to an unknown destination.



Ladies and gentlemen, that was the bad news. It was more than we would have liked. Finally, it’s good news that 2019 was a busy year of campaigns and elections, which has come to an end. We have finished campaigning for another two years. Both 2020 and 2021 will be about governance and the continuing work of country-building.



I know that there are some who find this less interesting, and are far more interested in the 2022 election struggle. They are already asking me about our election tactics for 2022. That’s a long way off! Today all we can say is that we’ll heed the advice of one of my favourite political philosophers, a certain Muhammad Ali: “Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.” I can tell you that we’re doing well at stinging, and while not all the preconditions for floating are in place yet, they will be by the beginning of the campaign. We’re not burying our heads in the sand, as we can see that the opposition is already making its preparations.



All life that grows, crawls and hops in field and hedgerow is welcome on their team, just as long as they can clamber back into power. They’re already trying on their uniforms, but the results are jarring. There are some fairly avant-garde ensembles: Nazi-style Arrow Cross jodhpurs, together with red waistcoats sporting rainbow-coloured badges. This reminds me of what the Szekler peasant said when he saw a tortoise for the first time: “Either this is something, or it’s going somewhere.”



In politics the best way to find out in what direction people are going is to look at the programmes of the parties. But here again with the opposition this isn’t easy to determine. It’s like the newly-wed couple, when, as the wife is serving dinner, she says “The only dishes I can cook are poppy-seed pasta and chicken stew.” Her husband asks, “And which one is this?” So, Ladies and Gentlemen, this is where we stand with our opponents, two years before the election.



But let’s now concentrate on Hungary. The achievements are those of the nation, the responsibilities are those of the Government. It is an old wisdom that if the nation does well, it should receive all the praise and glory; if it doesn’t do well, it is because it has been governed badly. Now our duty is to prepare the nation for the trials we face in the years ahead. We must not find ourselves with an empty pantry, and without reserves of dry gunpowder. There is no need to be afraid: if anyone knows all too well that challenges, tests and decisive trials are all part of a nation’s life, the Hungarians know it.



The only thing we can ask – and which we do ask – is for Hungarians to live and flourish in prosperity and security in their own homeland, which they deserve in return for their work and sacrifices and those of their ancestors. Let’s not be bashful: let’s say loud and clear that over the past one hundred years our forebears made great sacrifices, and that over the past ten years we, too, have worked hard. We have always given more to the world than we have received from it. Hungary deserves to be successful. Let us show everyone that those who dig traps for the Hungarians will fall into their own traps.



Ladies and gentlemen, we have fought and won many great battles. Those ahead of us will be no easier. Many of us believe that to be still standing here after such a century of history is proof that God has plans for this country. With all due humility, we can only say that we stand ready for the call, and we are ready for the journey into the next one hundred years. Hungary before all else, God above us all!



Go for it Hungary, go for it Hungarians!

"New Zealand has had its warmest winter since records began more than 100 years ago, according to official climate data. The National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research’s (Niwa) Seven Station Temperature Series, which began in 1909, shows the 2020 winter was 1.14C above average.Niwa forecaster Ben Noll said that seven of the 10 warmest winters on record in New Zealand have now occurred since 2000. “It just showcases the trajectory that we are on,” he said.  Noll said that, decades into the future, these present-day records might be more like average winters for the country and that would have impacts across many sectors of society.Seventeen locations around the country had record breaking-mean winter temperatures, and 53 other locations ranked within their top four warmest winters.The highest recorded winter 2020 temperature was 25.1C on 30 August in Timaru. It was the highest temperature recorded there during winter since records began in 1885. It was also the equal-fourth warmest winter temperature on record for the whole of New Zealand.The lowest temperature was -12.3°C, observed at Middlemarch, in the South Island’s Otago region, on 14 June.“It might feel nice to have a warm winter,” Noll said. “But you have to appreciate the full reasons behind it.”He said the winter warmth can be attributed to several “natural” factors including more warmer, sub-tropical winds, and higher air pressure than usual.“This contributed to a sunnier-than-normal winter in much of the South Island and lower North Island.”There were also above average sea-surface temperatures and, as an island nation, New Zealand’s air temperatures are strongly influenced by the waters surrounding it. In November, New Zealand passed landmark climate change legislation, with historic cross-party support, committing the nation to reduce its carbon emissions to zero by 2050 and to meeting its commitments under the Paris climate accords. At the time, the climate change minister, James Shaw, said the bill, which committed New Zealand to keeping global warming below 1.5C, provided a framework for the country to adapt too, and prepare for the climate emergency.Noll said the above average temperatures recorded was consistent with the country’s long-term climate-change trend, caused by greenhouse gas emissions.“You have to look under the hood, and you have climate change and are living in a warming world.” Noll said the higher temperatures contributed to a difficult ski seasonas the tourism industry struggled to get enough snow to lure customers.Of the six main centres, Auckland was the warmest during this past winter. Christchurch was the coldest, Tauranga had the most rain as well as being the sunniest. Dunedin was the driest, and Hamilton had the least sun.There were only a few locations around the country which had near average temperatures, including Tararua, Kaikoura, and parts of Southland and Otago."

There was a time in America when the Left could be counted on to defend free speech. But as countless examples today demonstrate, those days are long gone. From campus speech codes to campaign finance to prosecutorial threats against climate change critics and more, the evidence is as fresh as this morning’s newspapers.   
  
  
Campus assaults have been so well documented by the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) that they need no elaboration here. But the latest campaign finance “reform”—“until the court reverses its decision in _Citizens United_ ”—can be found championed in an op‐​ed in this morning’s _Washington Post_ by such stalwarts of the Left as Yale Law School’s Bruce Ackerman and Ian Ayers. On Tuesday last, it seems, Seattle voters approved a measure that would “give” each registered voter a $100 “democracy voucher” that could be spent “for only one purpose—to support their favorite candidates for municipal office.” The city can of course “give” that $100 voucher only if it first “takes” the $100 from its taxpayers, which it will do in all the unequal ways that modern tax systems exhibit. Thus is the political speech of private individuals reduced by forcing the funds they might otherwise direct to candidates of their choice to be redirected through this public funding scheme to candidates they may oppose.   
  
  
But that inroad on free speech pales in comparison to recent attacks on what most Americans would have thought were the free speech rights of climate skeptics, the RICO‐​ing of whom my colleague Walter Olson has been covering—along with the machinations of New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. The latest from the latter is all over the papers today, the _Post_ ’s headline reading “Exxon investigated over climate change research.” The Left has already browbeaten Exxon Mobil into ending its funding for think tanks and advocacy organizations that express climate change skepticism. Now, however, it’s getting more serious, with Schneiderman issuing a subpoena that focuses, we’re told, “on whether Exxon Mobil intentionally clouded public debate about science and hid from investors the risks that climate change could pose to its business.” “Clouded?” What, a debate that is crystal clear? That of course is what the environmental establishment would like as to believe.   
  
  
And circling back to the academy, so too, apparently, would one Naomi Oreskes, a professor of the history of science at Harvard University and a critic of Exxon who laments that we haven’t yet implemented a carbon tax. There are many reasons we haven’t, she tells the _Post_ , but a significant one “is the role of Exxon Mobil and others in fomenting disinformation, undermining public support for such initiatives, and lobbying against policies that would have begun to decrease our fossil fuel dependency.” And this from a professor of the history of science, the annals of which are littered with the corpses of “settled science.” Clearly, if we don’t stop this speaking and lobbying, we could have one more corpse.

"TOKYO  —   President Trump’s decision to pull the United States out of the   Partnership trade deal should have been good news for Hitoshi Kondo, a Japanese rice farmer. The sweeping   agreement, negotiated by the Obama administration and formally rejected by Mr. Trump on Monday, would have opened swaths of Japan’s highly protected agricultural sector, and was bitterly opposed by farmers. Now, without American involvement, the deal looks as good as dead. Mr. Kondo isn’t celebrating, though. “It’s actually scarier, because what comes next will be a lot harsher,” he said on Wednesday, as Japanese leaders scrambled to find a coherent response. What comes next, many in Japan believe, could be a bruising showdown between Tokyo and Washington. They fear a return to the trade wars of the 1980s and early ’90s, when many Americans saw Japan as an untrustworthy economic adversary. The   is a setback for Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe. Mr. Abe viewed the   Partnership as a way to advance two cherished goals: drawing the United States closer to Japan and other friendly Pacific Rim countries (the trade deal, known as TPP, does not include China, the region’s increasingly bristly superpower) and bolstering Japan’s lackluster economy. Such is Mr. Abe’s enthusiasm for the deal that his government finished ratifying it on Friday, just before Mr. Trump’s inauguration, despite Mr. Trump’s promise to withdraw. Mr. Trump has repeatedly said he wants to alter the American trade relationship with Japan, in which Japan sells far more goods to the United States than it buys in return. In a meeting with executives from Ford Motor and other American manufacturers this week, the president again said that such an imbalance was “not fair. ” And Mr. Trump says he wants to pursue trade agreements with individual nations, in lieu of group deals like TPP, which would have included countries comprising as much as 40 percent of the world’s economic output. Japan has long preferred multilateral   to    deals, but pressure to go along with Mr. Trump’s approach will be strong. “Japan may eventually agree to bilaterals with the U. S. to ensure that the U. S. stays engaged in Asia  —   both economically and to provide a security counter to China,” said Glen S. Fukushima, a former United States trade official who is now a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a think tank in Washington. Officially, Japan has not given up on the TPP, or on keeping the United States involved. The day after Mr. Trump signed his executive order committing to withdrawal, Mr. Abe said in Parliament he would “resolutely continue to seek understanding” from Washington of the deal’s strategic and economic importance. Mr. Abe’s advisers express hope that members of Mr. Trump’s cabinet with business and national security experience will lend their voices to the effort. Sadayuki Sakakibara, chairman of Keidanren, the lobbying group representing Japan’s largest corporations, encouraged Mr. Abe this week to take a   approach. Mr. Abe, he said, should try to keep the deal alive while engaging the United States directly, if necessary, “with the goal of eventually broadening negotiations to a multilateral level. ” Barring a drastic change in Mr. Trump’s views on trade, however, that could mean stringing matters out for years  —   possibly until the next administration, if not longer. The TPP’s demise doesn’t pose an immediate threat to Mr. Abe, whose poll numbers remain high. About as many Japanese voters favored the trade deal as opposed it. But none of Japan’s other trade options serve Mr. Abe’s goals the way TPP does. Japan and others could move on without Washington, which would require changing a condition that requires the United States to ratify the deal before it can take effect. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia said on Tuesday that he had been promoting that idea to Mr. Abe and several other leaders. Japan, with the   economy in the group, after the United States, would be a crucial participant. But it could be politically awkward for Mr. Abe, who sold the deal on the merits of American involvement. Even on narrow commercial grounds, he would have some explaining to do: Accepting more agricultural imports was supposed to be the price Japan paid for cheaper access to the vast United States market for cars and other manufactured goods. With the United States out of the picture, Mr. Abe could be accused of selling out farmers for little gain. Japan is negotiating other deals. One, with the European Union, predates Mr. Abe’s embrace of the TPP, in 2013, but talks had been put on hold. European negotiators want concessions on agriculture, too  —   another reason Japanese farmers are not breathing sighs of relief. In at least one area, dairy products, European demands go beyond what Japan agreed to in the TPP. Japan is also part of an Asian trade initiative, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. But that effort is being led by China, which has that partnership’s largest economy. China’s rise represents perhaps the biggest change from the United   trade battles of a generation ago. For Japan, it is both an added risk and a potential buffer. Many in the Abe administration hope that Mr. Trump will target China first, making Japan a lower priority, said a senior government official involved in trade matters, who asked for anonymity to discuss a sensitive issue. Companies, however, are dusting off their 1980s playbooks. Japanese carmakers built factories in the United States to head off American protectionism then  —   investments that Akio Toyoda, president of Toyota Motor, and others have made a recent point of highlighting. Only about a quarter of the   cars sold in the United States are imported, though Japan remains the source for many   components as well as design work. One of Mr. Trump’s complaints about Japan, repeated for decades by American trade negotiators, is that its economy is organized to keep foreign products out even without overt trade barriers like tariffs. By this logic, American carmakers have failed to penetrate the Japanese market because dealers and regulators collude against them. (Japan imposes no border taxes on cars the United States adds a 2. 5 percent levy to most imported Japanese vehicles.) Japan has been addressing     barriers  —   in some cases as a direct response to the TPP talks. It agreed during the negotiations to recognize some American automobile safety standards, for instance, and has narrowed a tax loophole that favors ultralight Japanese cars. In agriculture, Mr. Abe has moved to curb the power of Japan’s monopolistic farm cooperatives. Under TPP, Japan agreed to phase out import duties on about 2, 000 agricultural products, more than in any previous trade deal, but a smaller percentage of the total than other signatories. Sensitive products like rice were exempted. Mr. Kondo, the rice farmer, worries that Mr. Abe will concede more ground to the United States in order to appease Mr. Trump. “We have to sell cars to the U. S.,” he said, “and farmers will be traded away for access. ”"
"Climate change no longer seems just a future threat. In 2019, major fires in Australia, Russia and California burned over 13.5 million hectares of land – an area four times greater than the size of Belgium. Major floods and cyclones displaced over four million people in Bangladesh, India and Iran, while entire townships were laid to waste by storms such as hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas.  This year, things show no sign of letting up: the Australian fires continue, Greenland ice sheets are expected to lose another 267 billion tonnes of ice and thawing Arctic permafrost is causing positive feedback effects that will intensify climate heating and future impacts. In the face of such a global catastrophe, it can seem futile to take any action, individually. Over 36 billion tonnes of CO₂ are emitted globally every year, with each of us responsible for a fraction of this (for example, each person in the UK is responsible for around 5.8 tonnes; each person in India 1.8 tonnes). Even if we reduce personal CO₂ emissions, there are billions of other people who might not, plus a vast global economic system whose trajectory seems immovable. It seems unlikely that our lone actions and voices can really make a difference. But our actions do matter. The global environment is withering from the accumulation of billions of small impacts. Each of our individual purchases or travel choices is a vote for how we treat other people and the natural world, and even if we don’t directly see the results, our votes do count.  Our choices ripple across the surface of the globe and accumulate to create seemingly unstoppable tidal waves of destruction. And those big global institutions that seem so powerful are actually just made up from our collective worldviews (past and present). We are not individuals fighting against some kind of faceless system: we are the system that needs to change. As I explore in my new book The Self Delusion, scientific evidence from a wide range of disciplines shows that we are not isolated individuals, despite often perceiving ourselves this way.  There are many ways in which this can be observed. To start with, most of our 37 trillion human cells have such a short lifespan that we are essentially made anew every few months, directed by a genetic code that is a shared heritage not just of humanity but all life on Earth. Our minds, meanwhile, are deeply influenced by other people – every word, touch, pheromone received from others alters the neural network in your brains, so you cannot really call yourself the same person you were when you woke up this morning. And the new science of social networks shows that we are linked together so closely that ideas, behaviours and preferences flow between us in a way that makes it unclear where one mind ends and another begins. What’s more, new research in the field of environmental psychology finds that when we acknowledge this interconnectedness, we care more for others and the natural world. This idea was first speculated by “deep ecology” philosophers such as Arne Naess and has now been confirmed through modern quantitative surveys.  When people feel more connected to nature according to various metrics, they tend to have greater happiness, autonomy and personal growth, as well as stronger attitudes and behaviours towards protecting the environment. Similarly, when people score highly on metrics assessing social connectedness, they tend to have lower anxiety, greater wellbeing and more empathy. To gain all these benefits, we need a change of mindset. It is often said that when we are young and optimistic, we strive to change the world around us, but when we are older and wiser, we realise the futility of this and aspire to change ourselves instead.  Yet to solve the major environmental problems the world now faces, we actually need to do both – to change the world and ourselves. In fact, it is even more nuanced than that – because changing ourselves is a prerequisite for changing the world. Realising the true nature of our human connectedness actually engenders more ethical and environmentally responsible behaviours.  So how do we achieve this? Once again, recent scientific research can help by identifying the most effective approaches. Outdoor community activities and environmental education increase both our psychological connectedness to others and the natural world, as do meditation and similar practices. Even computer games and books can be designed to increase empathy. These offer empowering ways to become part of something bigger, to overcome the delusion of individual isolation. So although the impact of a lone individual to tackle climate change is negligible, fortunately, you are not just a lone individual – you are part of something much greater. We are deeply connected to one another at both a physical and psychological level, and when that truth is genuinely acknowledged, we act differently, becoming more compassionate and caring for each other and the environment.  Our interconnectedness also means that positive behaviours can cascade to influence many others. When we consider ourselves part of a collective, we can tackle the climate crisis.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe other day as I was looking to book a hotel in the city of Hamburg I came across the Novum Style Hotel Hamburg.
What caught my eye was that the booking and price conditions allow guests the option of offsetting the CO2 emissions that their stay produces.
According to the Novum’s reservation page and price calculator, a two-night stay in a “Style Class” room (for example) from November 25 to 27 costs 458.00 euros, but that such a stay would produce some 144 kilograms of climate-damaging CO2. But not to worry, for only €3.86 extra, it is possible to offset these emissions and allow you as the guest to sleep soundly without any burdening of your green conscience.

Pay it and you’ll feel as if you’ve done a great deed and played your part in protecting our supposedly increasingly agitated climate. You’ll then be able to relax with a clear conscience as you go sightseeing along the Reeperbahn or Herbertstrasse.
Thie Novum’s CO2 offset scheme of course reminds us of the old scam of almsgiving and paying indulgences to the Catholic Church to dodge going to Hell and suffering eternally.
Indeed the Novum’s site here explains that “climate change is the greatest challenge of the 21st century” and hints that it is all causing “increasing weather extremes, glacier melt, more frequent droughts and floods” and many other terrible things. However, this all could be avoided as the site assures visitors that it’s a “small contribution with a big impact“. The Novum site adds:
For offseting the CO2 emissions, additional costs of only 0.5 – 2.0% of the accommodations expenses are incurred.”

What a deal!*
Earmarked for climate protection projects
So what happens to the CO2 offsetting €3.86 that guests agree to pay?
The Hotel Novum’s site writes that it will “support a climate protection project that is certified according to international standards, one that otherwise would not be possible without your contribution.”
The project is proven to save CO2 and is checked by an independent third party on a regular basis.”
And naturally there’s full transparency, the Novum Hotel site promises. Guests who choose to have their emissions offset receive an ID number, which they can later enter at www.climatepartner.com to make sure that the voluntary contribution indeed leads to “climate neutrality”.
You can precisely check the level of greenhouse gases resulting from your overnight stay and which climate protection project was used for offsetting.”
Note that we are not singling out the Hotel Novum here, as surely many other hotels now offer their guests these conscience-soothing CO2 offsetting schemes. Also a host of other industries, like airlines, also offer the opportunity of climate almsgiving.

"**""I've been tear gassed a few times, but never when I was outside my office - popping out to get my lunch,"" says one trader at HSBC.**
He is describing the moment this week when Hong Kong's protests came to the central financial district , one of the world's biggest commercial hubs.
He says it was a watershed moment, that's made him and many of his peers question their future in the city.
Speaking to the BBC under condition of anonymity, directors at some of the biggest international banks and law firms said they are seeing their business in Hong Kong shrink as the protests continue to escalate.
Financial services make up a fifth of Hong Kong's economy and people come from all over the world to live and work here. Its large expatriate community is attracted by the low taxes, well-paid jobs, stability and high standards of living.
However, the lure of prosperity and stability in the East Asian hub has been undermined substantially since Hong Kong has been racked by five months of anti-government protests, backing increased democracy and opposing the actions of the police.
This last week where violence has intensified has made many firms reconsider the safety of their staff in the city.
One hedge fund manager has even been given a panic button app in case of an emergency and plans are in place with his work to evacuate him and his family to another major city ""if we were in danger they have a team of people who would get us out"".
A banker at HSBC says only half of their staff came in to the office on Friday as people are encouraged to work remotely if they can't get in safely.
Staff are kept closely informed about the situation on the ground according to a BNP Paribas employee ""We get regular emails early in the morning and through the day from the business continuity management team - telling us whether it's safe to go into offices - and whether we should go home early.""
Anecdotally, the political pressure from the Chinese government on banks and law firms is also growing - and it's putting pressure on staff.
Some partners in law firms are being asked to pin their colours to the mast and state whether they support the protesters or the Chinese government before winning business from Chinese firms.
Firms are under pressure to keep a lid on their staff speaking in public about their views.
One lawyer explains ""I've been on calls where people are asked to verbally communicate restraint and caution when sharing their views. Given the amount of people we employ here, it's a minor miracle nothing has happened"".
In the workplace, people are making informal rules not to discuss the subject within their teams because emotions are running so high.
""Clearly it's the only topic of conversation in the office, but opinions are so split,"" one banker says.
""In my team of nine, three are Chinese and two are Hong Kong Chinese and the rest are expats - it's a bit like Brexit - we all have violently different views.""
A video on social media of a man who claims to work at Citigroup being arrested by police has been widely shared in the banking community.
""This has scared people here - it makes you feel we could all get caught up in this""
A spokesperson for the US-headquartered banking group said: ""We are investigating this incident and while investigations continue it would be inappropriate to comment further"".
One of the biggest concerns for financial firms is the impact all of this is having on the economy as its reputation for stability unravels.
A source at one of the world's biggest international banks says it expects its Hong Kong revenue to be down by 25% in the last quarter of their financial year as a result of the violence.
Many banks are now reviewing their investment plans in Hong Kong over the next few years ""If we're still talking about this in six months time, people will start giving up on Hong Kong""
They are concerned that people who are planning major deals will now turn to banks and law firms in Singapore because, in the words of one, ""it has a more predictable medium-term outlook"".
So far most of the business impact has been on small companies - restaurants for example. There is concern amongst bankers, borne out in recent economic statistics, that this could spread more widely.
""The classic company we deal with would be lending money to a Chinese shipping company that does its financial transactions through HK. They rely on a healthy business environment in Hong Kong. Now we worry they will go bankrupt""."

Does it feel like you’re walking on eggshells lately when talking about politics? You’re not alone. A new national survey of 2,000 Americans I conducted at the Cato Institute finds that 62 percent of Americans say the political climate these days prevents them from saying what they believe because others might find it offensive. This share is up from 58 percent in 2017.



Notably, self‐​censorship is not a partisan issue. Majorities of Democrats (52 percent), Independents (59 percent), and Republicans (77 percent) all agree they have political views they are afraid to share.



 **Only Far Left Feels Free to Express Political Opinions**



Only staunch progressives reach a majority (58 percent) who feel free to speak their minds. But centrist liberals disagree: a slim majority (52 percent) feel they _cannot_ say what they believe in the current environment—up from 45 percent in 2017. Yet, just a few years ago, liberals felt they could openly express themselves (54 percent). In fact, nearly all political groups are self‐​censoring more today.



Could this simply be people self‐​censoring bigotry and prejudice? Perhaps for some. But the survey found that large majorities or near majorities of people across race, sex, and income all feel like they can’t say what they believe. That means this effect is not simply concentrated in one identity group, but pervasive across all.



The survey found that nearly two‐​thirds of Latino Americans (65 percent), Asian Americans (65 percent), white Americans (64 percent), as well as nearly half (49 percent) of African Americans, feel uneasy sharing their views. Similarly, both men (65 percent) and women (59 percent) self‐​censor.



Some may ask, perhaps the 62 percent are simply being polite and avoiding unnecessary offense? This is likely true for some. But the survey data offer some warnings against this interpretation.



Causing offense isn’t the only thing people are worried about. Many are concerned about their livelihoods and ability to provide for their families. 



Self‐​censorship is on the rise since 2017. It’s up 12 points among progressives (30–42 percent), and up 7 points among centrist liberals (45 to 52 percent), moderates (57 percent‐​64 percent), and centrist conservatives (70–77 percent). Only staunch conservatives haven’t changed much, perhaps because 76 percent said they were already self‐​censoring three years ago.



Also, consider how the question was asked. Respondents were asked if the _political climate_ prevented them from saying things they believe because others might find their ideas offensive. It did not ask if standards of decency and politeness prevented them from being rude.



Also, centrist liberals flipped from feeling free to express themselves (54 percent) in 2017 to now feeling they no longer can (52 percent) in 2020. These data align with the largely liberal signatories of the Harper’s open letter defending political expression and criticizing cancel culture. These writers and scholars were not decrying being polite, but the spread of an illiberal zeitgeist that restricts free thought and discourse.



 **One‐​Third Worry about Their Views Affecting Careers**



Causing offense isn’t the only thing people are worried about. Many are concerned about their livelihoods and the ability to provide for their families. Almost one‐​third (32 percent) of employed people say they worry they could get fired or miss out on job opportunities if their political views became known.



It’s not just one side of the political spectrum who feels this way. Similar shares of liberals (31 percent), conservatives (34 percent), and moderates (30 percent) are all worried about their jobs. These fears cut across demographics as well: 38 percent of Hispanic Americans, 31 percent of white Americans, 22 percent of African Americans, 27 percent of women, 35 percent of men, 36 percent of people earning less than $20,000 annually, and 33 percent of those earning more than $100,000 annually all fear “cancel culture.”



People with more education are more likely to worry about their politics affecting their career trajectory. But Republicans and Independents are driving the difference. Sixty percent (60 percent) of Republicans and 49 percent of Independents with post‐​graduate degrees fear being penalized at work if their political opinions became known, compared to 25 percent of Democrats with post‐​graduate degrees. Less of a gap exists between Republicans (27 percent), Democrats (23 percent), and Independents (18 percent) with high school diplomas.



It could be that the industries that employ more people with college and post‐​graduate degrees are lopsidedly left‐​of‐​center, leading independents and Republicans to self‐​censor. It could also be that independents and Republicans learn in college and especially in graduate school that their political views are penalized.



 **Left Especially Supports Firing Opposition Donors**



Are people overreacting? Perhaps not. The survey found that nearly one‐​third (31 percent) of Americans would support firing a business executive who personally donated to Donald Trump’s campaign. This share rises to 50 percent among staunch progressives. It’s not just the far left willing to punish their political adversaries. Almost one‐​quarter (22 percent) of all Americans and 36 percent of staunch conservatives would support firing Biden donors as well.



Although most Americans _overall_ oppose firing either Trump or Biden donors, it’s important to recognize that many industries and regions may be comprised of people with rather homogenous political views. Take, for instance, industries like academia, media, Hollywood, and tech, which overwhelmingly employ people who are left of center. Or industries like mining, oil and gas, home building, automotive, and construction that are largely right of center.



Even within industries, you can find clusters of political homogeneity. For instance, The New York Times reports that 77 percent of infectious disease specialists are registered Democrats while 67 percent of surgeons are registered Republicans. So an industry that slants left or right could reach a majority (or close to it) in favor of firing Trump or Biden donors in their midst.



 **‘Cancel Culture’ Isn’t New**



In his 1940 essay, “On Freedom,” Albert Einstein argued that scientific progress depends on open discourse, and that “laws alone cannot secure freedom of expression; in order that every man present his views without penalty there must be a spirit of tolerance.” This spirit of tolerance goes beyond constitutional protections from government censorship. Private censorship can also raise the cost of expression and thereby stifle open discourse.



Although the principles of free expression and tolerance are deeply engrained in American culture, many throughout American history have resisted this pluralistic approach. In other words, so‐​called “cancel culture” is not new. Political scientists have long documented this urge in American political life, found on both the left and right.



Dating back to the early 1970s, the General Social Survey found that 60 percent of Americans supported firing a communist college professor, 52 percent supported firing an “anti‐​religionist” professor, and 48 percent thought a gay professor shouldn’t be allowed to teach at a university. Notably, there wasn’t much difference between Democrats and Republicans.



For example, in 1973, 53 percent of Republicans and 52 percent of Democrats thought a gay person shouldn’t be allowed to teach at a university. Although far fewer today, substantial shares continue to support severe economic penalties for professors who are gay (11 percent), communist (31 percent), or against organized religion (31 percent).



 **Why Some People Want to Punish Others for Their Ideas**



Why do some want to inflict severe punishment on their fellow Americans over political disagreements? This desire to silence one’s political opponents is separate from efforts to marginalize overtly bigoted speech and behavior—efforts most Americans support. But what explains the psychological motives behind cancel culture that increasingly capture innocent people and shut down political discourse?



Research in political psychology has found some personality styles are more demanding of conformity and more willing to squash dissent. In academic parlance, it’s called the “authoritarian personality.” (See here, here, and here.)



In response to World War II, academics tried to identify what personality types would be drawn to totalitarian ideologies. Much of this research inappropriately ascribed the authoritarian personality near‐​exclusively to the political right. However, new research is finding evidence that there is both a left‐​wing and right‐​wing variant of the authoritarian personality.



Thus, these authoritarian tendencies may manifest in different ways and in reaction to different issues, but there appear to be some core psychological tendencies shared between left‐​wing and right‐​wing “authoritarians.” Observing how both groups think alike can help pinpoint the core features of this illiberal style in American politics.



Surveys that identified left‐​wing and right‐​wing “authoritarians” found that both scored significantly higher on psychological measures of dogmatism, confirmatory thinking, moral disengagement, need for closure, affective polarization, political certainty, and tolerance of political violence, and both scored significantly lower on intellectual humility.



In other words, Americans with left‐​wing or right‐​wing authoritarian tendencies are more likely to be dogmatically rigid and eschew nuance. A key feature is a failure to recognize the possibility that some of what they assume, observe, or interpret might be wrong. They tend to believe they have all the facts.



Partly contributing to this is the tendency to discount or ignore disconfirming evidence. But it’s more than just rigid, confirmatory thinking. “Authoritarians” begin to dehumanize their political opponents, assume the worst possible of intentions, lack compassion for them, and then rationalize and even support harm against them. While each of these tendencies independently may not mean someone has authoritarian inclinations, these traits combined make one more likely to seek to squash political dissent when threatened.



Threat, particularly ideological threat, is the necessary ingredient to activate people with latent authoritarian tendencies and motivate their desire to punish others. Social media may have a catalyzing effect in activating latent authoritarianism on left and right, as it constantly barrages people with ideas, images, and videos that threaten their ideological boundaries, norms, and authorities. In short, some social media companies could be making Americans more authoritarian.



 **Why We Should Care**



There are many reasons to resist this authoritarian urge to squash dissent. The first is that scientific progress, and by extension, the improvement of human well‐​being generally, requires free thought and open discourse. As Jonathan Rauch explains in his book, “Kindly Inquisitors,” the scientific method breaks down when people become reluctant to ask questions, be creative, challenge each other, and seek out and understand evidence.



Further, as Thomas Chatteron Williams explained in a New Yorker interview, the culture of canceling signals to people what the boundaries of “acceptable” ideas are or else suffer severe economic and emotional punishment. Thus many “steer far clear of the boundary,” causing a “narrowing…stifling effect on not just speech but on thought,” he explained.



Yet silencing people and stifling free thought isn’t an effective long‐​run strategy. It rarely _changes minds._ It just shuts down civil discourse and prevents people from having opportunities to modify their ideas in the face of new information. Instead, people hold onto their opinions, and just sweep them under the rug.



Political opponents’ disengagement doesn’t necessarily mean victory. Americans still vote. And their political views, silent or expressed, affect how they vote. Persuasion is necessary to change how people think and thus who and what they vote for. But persuasion is hard and requires open dialogue.



Social psychologists have found evidence that we aren’t very good at updating our opinions by ourselves. We need other people we respect to ask us to explain our views and then challenge us with new considerations. It’s typically through this back and forth process that we update our views when people we trust present us with new, compelling information.



But this only works when we feel comfortable to engage in a dialogue. Thus it is only with open dialogue that people’s opinions can be examined, understood, or reformed. Thereby, the best long‐​term strategy is persuasion, not silencing. And persuasion requires open debate.



I propose we take this wise advice from social psychologist Jonathan Haidt: let us first try to “give less offense” and then let us make efforts to “take less offense” ourselves.

"In recent years there has been a resurgent scientific interest in the psychological effects of psychedelic drugs. Consider the example of recent trials in which psilocybin was administered to people diagnosed with treatment-resistant depression. Those involved reported significantly positive responses even six months later.  Such studies point with increasing confidence to the therapeutic potential of psychedelics for treating depression, addiction, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and enhancing palliative care. Amidst this “psychedelic renaissance”, there is one recent study in particular that has grabbed my attention. This study, published in a reputable, peer-reviewed international journal, makes even bolder claims about the potential of psychedelics – not only for improving mental health, but also, remarkably, as a key to overcoming inaction in the face of the climate crisis. On what grounds? The authors justify their claim by zooming in on one explanation for their apparently positive effect on well-being, established in previous research. As well as “resetting” key brain circuitry and enhancing emotional responsiveness, psychedelics commonly increase people’s positive feelings of connectedness – to one’s self and others, and to the natural world. Connection to nature is something I’m interested in and have researched with colleagues, especially in relation to mental health. “Nature-connectedness” is now considered a research topic in its own right in the field of psychology, an individual quality that can be measured. It refers not just to the extent of an individual’s contact with natural settings, but the extent to which they report feeling connected to and part of the natural world. Using established measures of nature connectedness with more than 600 participants before and after one or more psychedelic experiences, the researchers found that psychedelic drug use enhanced participants’ sense of being connected to nature, an effect that deepened when that experience took place in natural settings. Perhaps this isn’t that surprising. It is what they argue on the basis of these results that is especially interesting. They cite evidence suggesting direct experiences of nature and a sense of nature connectedness underpin enhanced environmental awareness and a desire to care for nature, therefore reducing people’s “environmentally destructive behaviour”. This is nothing new. What is new is their claim that if psychedelic interventions significantly deepen a sense of connection, they might also have a role in contributing to both mental and planetary health. Could this be true? What is happening, psychologically speaking, during psychedelic experiences of connectedness? Accounts point to feelings of self-transcendence, whereby the boundaries between one’s self and others, or the self and the natural world, are temporarily dissolved. This is not so much an experience of one being connecting to another, as a temporary collapse of the very distinction between the self and nature.  On taking psychedelics, one can be momentarily absorbed in a state of “oneness” or “oceanic boundlessness”. This reminds me of a participant’s response in another study, published in 2017, exploring psychedelic treatments for depression: Before I enjoyed nature, now I feel part of it. Before I was looking at it as a thing, like TV or a painting. [But] you’re part of it, there’s no separation or distinction, you are it. The authors claim that such experiences, in which the self seems to have extended into nature, deeply impress an affiliation with nature that motivates us to care and protect. They argue that this cannot but engender an increased sense of environmental responsibility. As a result, they suggest that administering controlled amounts of psychedelic drugs to people while they are immersed in natural environments could hold potential for fostering greater environmental awareness and the motivation to act in more environmentally responsible ways. You may or not be convinced by their argument, and the potential of psychedelics for provoking environmental awareness, behaviour change and activism is still to be seen. There is certainly no magic pill that can mobilise environmental responsibility on a mass scale, psychedelic or otherwise.  And as a critical psychologist engaging with the climate crisis, I can see the danger here in focusing on individual behaviour change, when part of the problem is that our energies are not directed at structural change and those wielding the greatest power, which the authors of this study acknowledge. Workable solutions to the climate crisis require more than shifts in individual perspective, however radical or profound. Nonetheless, for me at least, seriously considering the physical, psychological, social and even environmental value of psychedelic drugs is in itself a welcome challenge to the deeply held, and often hypocritical, cultural assumptions we have about drugs and their prohibition. To be clear, I am not advocating an unregulated psychedelic free for all. The trials mentioned here consist of carefully controlled doses, with participants supported by professional therapists. But there is value in considering how profound experiences, not necessarily unchallenging ones, might have transformative power. For a start, psychedelic experiences of connectedness might help get beyond feelings of futility and isolation in the face of the climate crisis, when we think of ourselves only as helpless individuals, helping us to forge connections and see wider patterns.     Powerful experiences of nature might be especially significant today too. We increasingly live in an age of extinction. Nature is in retreat, urbanism and everyday alienation from nature is establishing itself as the norm, and we are confronting loss on a scale we find difficult to acknowledge and process. In such unprecedented times, we can find ourselves trapped in dissociative psychological states, knowing about environmental crisis while doing all we can to stop that knowledge affecting us. This is true at an individual level but also in familiar social settings of shared silence and discomfort. When we lack direct experiences of nature, are we missing a vital component of what is needed to really care for and take action on behalf of the environment of which we are an integral part? Maybe, just maybe, the profound experiential connectedness arising from psychedelic experiences in nature is analogous to the application of a defibrillator following cardiac arrest. Perhaps psychedelics could give us the shock that is needed to restart the beating heart of ecological awareness before it is too late."
"**Political protests and petrol bombs aren't the ideal backdrop for a top global company looking to raise billions of dollars from investors.**
But that's exactly what Alibaba is doing.
The Chinese e-commerce giant is preparing to raise at least $11bn (Â£8.5bn) by listing its shares on the Hong Kong stock exchange next week, in what could be the year's biggest public share sale.
""Hong Kong is one of the world's most important financial centers,"" reads a letter to potential investors from Alibaba's chairman, Daniel Zhang.
""During this time of ongoing change, we continue to believe that the future of Hong Kong remains bright.""
That's a pretty optimistic assessment given the violence on university campuses and the streets of Hong Kong this week alone.
So why now? And what does the multi-billion dollar listing tell us about investor confidence in Hong Kong?
Sources close to the company say political unrest in Hong Kong wasn't a factor in whether to go ahead with the listing, and the social upheaval doesn't appear to have affected appetite for Alibaba's shares.
The share offer closed ahead of schedule, which means that investors snapped up the stock at a faster pace than expected.
But some say the timing of the listing is questionable.
Max Bondurri, founder of SGMC Capital, says Alibaba could have raised more funds if it had waited.
""From a purely economic point of view they could have waited till next year to list, at a time when some of the unrest may perhaps have died down.""
However, he believes the decision to list now was motivated also by political, rather than purely financial, concerns.""
The suggestion is that Beijing can influence decision-making at Chinese companies to serve its political interests.
""It's an attempt to take the negative headlines away from what's going on in the streets and universities,"" he says.
""It will help to remind international investors that Hong Kong is still open for business.""
Still, the protests have had an impact. The listing event itself is likely to be low-key and low-profile.
It is unclear whether Jack Ma, the exuberant former chairman whose name has become synonymous with the e-commerce giant, will attend. It's also not clear if Mr Zhang will be there.
This raises questions about the level of concern the firm might have about potential violence outside the exchange or near its executives.
Investors won't queue up outside the exchange or banks to get their hands on paper receipts because Alibaba has decided to go paperless for this listing - the first time a firm has done so in Hong Kong. Some have said this is to avoid the risk of protestors attacking investors who might be out on the streets.
Alibaba's listing is likely to distract from the violence playing out on the streets, for a few days at least.
It may also reassure investors that if a giant such as Alibaba is willing to take the risk and list its shares in Hong Kong, the city's reputation as a financial hub must still be intact.
Weijian Shan, the man often described as Asia's private equity ""king"", told me the Hong Kong Stock Exchange was the only ""bright spot"" in an economy currently beset by violent turmoil and recession.
More than two hundred Chinese companies are listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, making up almost half of the exchange's value.
Their value is unlikely to be affected by the day-to-day protests, although negative sentiment from the political crisis no doubt filters through to the stock market in moments of heightened tension.
Still, concerns over Hong Kong's reputation should be taken seriously - and it's not just because of the unrest.
Increasingly, there's a perception in the business community that Beijing calls the shots in Hong Kong.
This week, Chinese state media came out strongly against a decision by Hong Kong's courts that the anti-mask ban was unconstitutional, raising fears that Beijing will wade in even further.
This potentially threatens the independence of Hong Kong's judiciary, the sole reason international companies come to the city and list there.
Hong Kong's courts are - for now at least - still independent from China's. The more that fades, the more Hong Kong's future as an international financial centre is diminished - whether companies like Alibaba choose to list there or not.
Against a complicated political backdrop, Alibaba has long expressed a desire to bring the company ""home"" to Hong Kong.
It had hoped to list its shares there in 2014, when the firm first went public. But the city's listing rules at the time meant it made more sense for the company to float in New York.
An investor in Alibaba's US shares told me that the Hong Kong listing was a ""genius move"", because it will allow mainland Chinese investors to buy shares in a company they know well.
""Expect the shares to pop on the first day of trade,"" says the investor, who didn't want to be named.
""Mainland Chinese investors will want to show their support for a company they see as one of their own.""
Even though Alibaba has no shortage of cash, the Hong Kong listing could help to raise money for future challenges, especially in the US.
""Because of the US-China trade war, there's more scrutiny of Chinese companies listed in the US,"" he says.
""If Alibaba raises this cash in Hong Kong, it allows them to potentially delist their shares in the US if they run into any trouble with US authorities in the future over any potential national security concerns.""
For now, Alibaba says there are no plans to delist its shares in the US.
""The New York Stock Exchange is the primary listing venue"" an Alibaba spokesperson told me. ""We will continue to be listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange."""

Ardern’s globalist position in the standoff with **Scott Morrison** over thugs, paedophiles, wife bashers and bikies being sent packing back to New Zealand was downright embarrassing. There are a time and place for most things, but Ardern displayed no diplomacy when she publicly insulted the Australian PM, demanding that Morrison rewrite Australian citizenship laws to fall in line with ours. Generally speaking, after 10 years we take responsibility for Australians living and working here. [Simon Bridges saw the opportunity](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/119895694/getting-a-win-from-an-australian-loselose) and chipped in saying he would change our rules to follow the Australian regime if he was PM – as usual, too little too late, Simon. 



“Ardern’s statement, while standing alongside Morrison, that “We will own our people. We ask that Australia stop exporting theirs”, was met with a tight smile and a polite rebuff.”



Australian law is very clear about the position of New Zealanders living in Australia. Australian deportees either currently hold or previously held current NZ passports when they moved across the Tasman but unlike New Zealand, they are not given Australian citizenship rights simply because they were born in, or grew up in Australia. 



The question needs to be addressed as to why long-term Australian residents never applied for Australian citizenship.



To be eligible to apply for Australian citizenship, you must have: 



– Been an Australian permanent resident for at least 1 year and lived in Australia for at least 9 out of 12 months before you apply



– Been lawfully resident in Australia for at least 4 years before you apply



– Not been absent from Australia for more than 12 months in the last 4 years before you apply



– Good moral character”



The simple answer is that these people would be turned down for lack of good moral character after their enforced stays in Her Majesty’s Australian lockup. Australia doesn’t want these dregs of society, and neither do we, but legally they are still our responsibility. Ardern is on thin ice and exhibits desperation by canvassing votes from the dregs of society.



Australia affords New Zealanders seeking to live and work in Australia special dispensation, a reciprocal arrangement, but Ardern says Australia should follow our lead and adopt a 10 year automatic right to citizenship. 



“New Zealand citizens are granted a Special Category visa (SCV) upon arrival to Australia. A SCV is a temporary visa but it grants the New Zealand citizen the right to live and work in Australia for the duration of their stay. The SCV automatically expires when the New Zealand citizen departs Australia.”



Despite Ardern being well outside the bounds of diplomacy, New Zealand media rushed to pat her on the head with the headline “PM Jacinda Ardern gets a win in Scott Morrison’s territory”. UK media took the opposite stance. 



“But that would leave Australia stuck with dangerous and violent offenders, 40 per cent of whom go on to re-offend. 



More than 1,000 New Zealanders have been deported from Australia since 2014 when changes were made to the Migration Act. 



Drug offences, assault and child sex offences are the most common charges that result in deportation. The law means even if an individual is an Australian permanent resident, and has lived and worked in the country for decades, they can still be deported. 



In the name of national security, they can be ejected on ‘bad character’ grounds if they are sentenced to 12 months or more in prison. New Zealanders are thought to be the largest group to have had their visas cancels and be held in Australian immigration detention centres.”



Australian media are waking up to the hypocrisy, poor performance and cracks in Jacinda Ardern’s coalition government. Extracts from an editorial in _The Australian_ show a turnaround from Australian media recently clamouring for Ardern to cross the ditch.



“Last August Ms Ardern said Australia had “to answer to the Pacific” for its position on climate change. She did not mention, conveniently, New Zealand is forecast to fail to meet its Paris target to reduce emissions by 30 per cent of 2005 levels by 2030. By contrast Australia is on track to meet its 26 per cent to 28 per cent reduction target, with or without Kyoto carry-over credits. New Zealand failed to meet first-round Kyoto targets and did not sign up to Kyoto for 2020.



At last year’s Pacific Islands Forum in Tuvalu, Ms Ardern asked Mr Morrison to back a UN push for a carbon-neutral economy by 2050, declaring every nation had to “do its bit” to fight global warming. Yet New Zealand has excluded agriculture and methane from its carbon-neutral pledge. That is cute, if not convenient, given agricultural products and meat are New Zealand’s major exports, accounting for 40 per cent of sales. Agriculture makes up half of its CO2 emissions. 



On Thursday senator Matt Canavan argued online that New Zealand’s “brave” target, welcomed by environmental activist groups, was “literally an example of doing things by half”. Even with some heroic assumptions (a methane vaccine for sheep), official modelling shows net zero emissions by 2050 would smash New Zealand’s agriculture and shrink its economy by 10 to 20 per cent.



Ms Ardern’s Labour has not delivered on major promises. It pledged to build 100,000 high-quality, low-income houses over a decade via the KiwiBuild program; so far the tally is 315 houses. Ending child poverty may be as elusive for Ms Ardern as it was for Bob Hawke four decades ago. 



GDP is growing at a touch above 2 per cent. The small trading nation, dependent on China, will be rocked by a drying up of tourists due to the COVID-19 outbreak and a slide in global demand for its exports. Ms Ardern is tethered to periodic shocks from her “coalition of losers” partners. New Zealand First leader Winston Peters, a deputy prime minister from the Barnaby Joyce school of parochial populism and deportment, will tug Labour one way. The Greens, fixated on cannabis legalisation and carbon neutrality, whatever the cost, will push the other way. 



One thing you can be sure about, Australia won’t be goading its Tasman cousins about the hypocrisy of their climate postures or trying to steal the Kiwi leader’s global limelight.”



Ouch! Scott Morrison was not bothered by Ardern’s blustering demand either, brushing her aside with the same concern one might use on an annoying insect.

"A Professor of Climate Change at Adelaide University thinks we should halve Australia’s domestic ruminant numbers within two years.
When we have removed our cattle, sheep and goats, when water buy-back has diverted our irrigation water to Environmental Flows, and Australia is covered by regrowth brigalow, carbon credit forests, ethanol crop farms, protected remnant vegetation, Wilderness No-Go areas, National Parks, aboriginal reserves, World Heritage Areas, marine parks and Wild Rivers Reserves, I have just one question: “What are we going to eat?”

Well, maybe not.  Scientists are increasingly finding that the two fundamental points cited above may not be supported by the evidence.
In 2016, an examination of the peer-reviewed scientific literature has uncovered dozens of paleoclimate reconstructions that reveal modern “global” warming has not actually been global in scale after all, as there are a large number of regions on the globe where it has been cooling for decades.   Even if it was warming on a global scale, the paleoclimate evidence strongly suggests that the modern warm climate is neither unusual or profoundly different than it has been in the past.  In fact, today’s regional warmth isn’t even close to approaching the Earth’s maximum temperatures achieved earlier in the Holocene, or as recently as 1,000 years ago (the Medieval Warm Period), when anthropogenic CO2 emissions could not have exerted a climate impact.
In fact, there is a growing body of evidence that the warming in recent decades is not even unprecedented within the context of the last 80 years.   That’s because the amplitude of the 1930s and 1940s warm period matched or exceeded that of the warmth in the late 20th and early 21st centuries in many regions of the world.  Furthermore, between the warmth of the 1930s and ’40s and the warmth of the 1990s to present, there was a very widely publicized cooling period (late 1950s to early 1970s) that was heavily discussed in the peer-reviewed scientific literature.
Today’s instrumental datasets curiously do not reflect this 20th century warming-cooling-warming oscillatory shape, however, as doing so would not lend support to the modeled understanding that climate is shaped by anthropogenic CO2 emissions, which have increased linearly, not cyclically.  In fact, not only has the high amplitude of the 1930s and 1940s warmth been “adjusted” down or depressed in global-scale representations of instrumental temperatures by NASA or the MetOffice, the substantial cooling (-0.5°C in the Northern Hemisphere, including -1.5°C cooling in the Arctic region) that occurred in the 1960s and 1970s has all but disappeared from today’s temperature graphs.
Scientists, meanwhile, keep on publishing their results.  And their results don’t lend support to the narrative that the globe has been synchronously warming, or warming in linear fashion and in concert with the rise in anthropogenic CO2 emissions.  Indeed, in many regions of the world, decadal-scale cooling has occurred since the mid-20th century.
Listed below are a collection of 60 peer-reviewed scientific papers published within the last year (2016) undermining the “consensus” position that modern warming patterns are global in extent and synchronization, and that today’s warmth is both unusual and unprecedented.  The first section (1) identifies the regions of the world where there has been no net warming in recent decades.  The second section (2) puts modern climate into its much larger Holocene context, revealing just how insignificant and unremarkable this current (regional) warming trend has been relative to history.
(1) ‘Global’ Warming? No Net Warming In These Regions Since Mid Or Late 20th Century
De Jong et al., 2016  (Andes, South America)
[T]he reconstruction…shows that recent warming (until AD 2009) is not exceptional in the context of the past century. For example, the periods around AD 1940 and from AD 1950–1955 were warmer. This is also shown in the reanalysis data for this region and was also observed by Neukom et al. (2010b) and Neukom and Gergis (2011) for Patagonia and central Chile. Similarly, based on tree ring analyses from the upper tree limit in northern Patagonia, Villalba et al. (2003) found that the period just before AD 1950 was substantially warmer than more recent decades.

Zhu et al., 2016 (China)
[W]e should point out that the rapid warming during the 20th century was not especially obvious in our reconstructed RLST.

Zhang et al., 2016  (Scandinavia)
[P]resent-day global mean air temperatures may have been equally high around 1000 years ago during the so-called Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA; Lamb, 1969; Grove and Switsur, 1994). However, since regional temperature reconstructions display large variability in the timing and magnitude of the MCA (PAGES 2k Consortium, 2013), this issue has not yet been adequately settled. Hence, there is still a great need to produce and improve empirical proxy data to further our understanding of near and distant climate changes.

Chandler et al., 2016 (South Iceland)
Analysis of climate data for SE Iceland also indicates that the three periods of ice-frontal retreat [1936-’41, 1951-’56, and 2006-’11] identified are associated with similar summer air temperature values, which has previously been shown to be a key control in terminus variations in Iceland. We, therefore, demonstrated that the coincidence of the most recent phase of ice-frontal retreat at Skálafellsjökull (2006–2011) and warming summer temperatures is not unusual in the context of the last ~80 years. This highlights the need to place observations of contemporary glacier change in a broader, longer-term (centennial) context.

Jones et al., 2016    (Southern Ocean)
 [C]limate model simulations that include anthropogenic forcing are not compatible with the observed trends.

Zhu et al., 2016 (Northeast China)
We identified four major cold periods (1839–1846, 1884–1901, 1906–1908 and 1941–1958) and three major warm periods (1855–1880, 1918–1932 and 1998–2013) in the past 211 years. The multi-taper method spectral analysis revealed significant cycles at 48.8, 11.5, 8.9, 3.9, 3.5 and 2–3 years, which might be associated with global climate oscillations and land-sea thermal contrasts, such as the sea surface temperatures, El Niño-Southern Oscillation, Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and solar activity.

Rydval et al., 2016  (Scotland)

Hasholt et al., 2016 (Southeast Greenland)
We determined that temperatures for the ablation measurement periods in late July to early September were similar in both 1933 and the recent period [1990s – present], indicating that the temperature forcing of ablation within the early warm period and the present are similar.

Incarbona et al., 2016  (Sicily, Aegean Sea)
Solar activity modulates patterns in surface temperature and pressure that resemble NAO phases, through dynamical coupling processes between the stratosphere and the troposphere that transmit the solar signal to the Earth’s surface.

Tipton et al., 2016 (Hudson Valley, New York)

Serykh, 2016
The very fast climate warming of the Euro-Asian continent that began in the 1970s may be associated with the enhanced heat transport from the North Atlantic in this period. This is evident from the fields and time series obtained in the present paper. The hiatus of this warming after 1999 may be due to the decreased heat transfer from the North Atlantic Ocean to the Eurasian territory.

Ogi et al, 2016  (Greenland, West and South)

Zinke et al., 2016  (Indian Ocean)
We calibrate individual robust Sr / Ca records with in situ SST and various gridded SST products. The results show that the SST record from Cabri provides the first Indian Ocean coral proxy time series that records the SST signature of the PDO in the south-central Indian Ocean since 1945. … Marked negative Sr /Ca anomalies (warmer) are observed during the first half of the 20th century centred at 1918/19, 1936–1941 and in the period 1948–1951 that exceed anomalies in the 1961 to 1990 reference period.

de Jong and de Steur, 2016 (North Atlantic)

 
O’Donnell et al., 2016 (Australia SE)

Moreno et al., 2016   (Portugal)
The major external forcing of the climate system derives from the Sun. A solar signature has been found in global mean surface temperatures, with evidence directly related to two noticeably different features of the Sun’s dynamics: its short-term irradiance fluctuations and secular patterns of 22-year and 11-year cycles (Scafetta and West, 2008). … [I]t is recognized that solar forcing manifestations denote a strong spatial and seasonal variability (Usoskin et al., 2006), and this would be the reason why it might be illusive to seek a single global relationship between climate and solar activity (de Jager, 2005). Thus, Le Mouël et al. (2009) stated that a regional approach may allow one to identify specific forms of solar forcing, where and when the solar input is most important. … [S]olar footprints on terrestrial temperatures [are] due to the strong non-linear hydrodynamic interactions across the Earth’s surface, and the accepted longerterm solar activity influence creating temperature oscillations for tens or even hundreds of years (Scafetta and West, 2003, 2007, 2008). … These spectral analysis results appear to support a solar forcing with regards to Minho GHD [grape harvest dates]

Christy and McNider, 2016  (Alabama, U.S.)
The time frame is 1883-2014. … Varying the parameters of the construction methodology creates 333 time series with a central trend-value based on the largest group of stations of -0.07 °C decade-1 with a best-guess estimate of measurement uncertainty being -0.12 to -0.02 °C decade-1. This best-guess result is insignificantly different (0.01 C decade-1) from a similar regional calculation using NOAA nClimDiv data beginning in 1895. … Finally, 77 CMIP-5 climate model runs are examined for Alabama and indicate no skill at replicating long-term temperature and precipitation changes since 1895.

van As et al., 2016 (Greenland Ice Sheet)
We conclude that at our study sites annual net ablation is likely to be larger in recent years than during any previous period in the instrumental era, covering up to 150 years. … [I]n southern Greenland ablation peaked significantly around 1930. While most of Greenland underwent relatively warm (summer) conditions in the 1930s (Cappelen 2015), this was most notable at the more southern locations, resulting in amplified ablation values according to our estimates. JJA [summer] temperatures were higher in 1928 and 1929 than in any other year of the Qaqortoq record, both attaining values of 9.2°C. This suggests that ablation in those years may have exceeded the largest net ablation measured on the Greenland ice sheet ( 2010).

Distal lakes document rapid early Holocene deglaciation from the coast and across the highlands south of the glacier. Sediment from Skorarvatn, a lake to the north of Drangajokull, shows that the northern margin of the ice cap reached a size comparable to its contemporary limit by ~10.3 ka. Two southeastern lakes with catchments extending well beneath modern Drangajokull confirm that by ~9.2 ka, the ice cap was reduced to ~20% of its current area.

Jalali et al., 2016  (Mediterranean Sea)
Several proxy records have documented surface water variability of the Mediterranean Sea during the Holocene (Kallel et al., 1997a, b, 2004; Cacho et al., 2001; Guinta et al., 2001; Rohling et al., 2002; Emeis et al., 2003; Essalami et al., 2007; Frigola et al., 2007; Castañeda et al., 2010; Boussetta et al., 2012; Martrat et al., 2014). Most of them reveal that Mediterranean Sea surface temperatures (SSTs) have undergone a long-term cooling punctuated by several cold relapses (CRs; Cacho et al., 2001; Frigola et al., 2007). While orbital forcing likely explains this long-term tendency, solar activity and volcanism contribute to forced variability (Mayewski et al., 2004; Wanner et al., 2011) together with internal variability (i.e. Atlantic multi-decadal variability (AMV), North Atlantic Oscillation; NAO) all together embedded in the multi-decadal scale variability seen in paleorecords.

[R]ecent air temperatures (1993–2003) are, on average, 0.5 °C lower than air temperatures estimated during the MWP [Medieval Warm Period] and Holocene Climate Optimum. … [P]eriods warmer than modern periods occurred for ∼6.5 ka [6,500 years] including during the HCO and Medieval Warm Period.

Finsinger et al., 2016   (Romania, Carpathians)

Ge et al., 2016  (China)
Results of this study show that warm intervals over the last 2000 years were in AD 1-200, AD 551-760, AD 951-1320, and after AD 1921, while cold intervals were in AD 201-350, AD 441-530, AD 781-950, and AD 1321-1920. Interestingly, temperatures during AD 981-1100 and AD 1201-1270 were comparable to those of our Present Warm Period, but have an uncertainty of 0.28°-0.42°C at 95% confidence level. Temperature variations over the whole of China are typically in phase with those of the Northern Hemisphere (NH) after AD 1000, the period which covers the Medieval Climate Anomaly, the Little Ice Age (LIA), and the Present Warm Period.

Thomas et al., 2016 (Greenland, West)
Paired climate and ice sheet records from previous warm periods can elucidate the factors influencing GrIS mass balance on time scales longer than the observational record [Briner et al., 2016]. During the middle Holocene, temperature on Greenland was ~ 2°C higher than present [Cuffey and Clow, 1997; Axford et al., 2013].


 
Thirumalai et al., 2016  (Tropical Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico)

Sanchez-Lopez et al., 2016  (Iberian Peninsula)
The dominant warm and arid conditions during the MCA [Medieval Climate Anomaly, 900-1300  CE], and the cold and wet conditions during the LIA [Little Ice Age, 1300-1850 CE] indicate the interplay of the NAO+, EA+ and NAO- , EA- [positive/negative North Atlantic Oscillation, East Atlantic phases], respectively. Furthermore, the higher solar irradiance during the [“warm conditions”] RP [Roman Period, 200 BCE – 500 CE] and MCA [Medieval Climate Anomaly, 900-1300 CE] may support the predominance of the EA+ [positive East Atlantic] phase, whereas the opposite scenario [“colder temperatures”] during the EMA [Early Middle Age, 500-900 CE] and LIA [Little Ice Age, 1300-1850 CE] may support the predominance of the EA- [negative East Atlantic] phase, which would favour the occurrence of frequent and persistent blocking events in the Atlantic region during these periods.

Rosenthal et al., 2017 (Pacific, Atlantic Oceans)
Here we review proxy records of intermediate water temperatures from sediment cores and corals in the equatorial Pacific and northeastern Atlantic Oceans, spanning 10,000 years beyond the instrumental record. These records suggests that intermediate waters [0-700 m] were 1.5-2°C warmer during the Holocene Thermal Maximum than in the last century. Intermediate water masses cooled by 0.9°C from the Medieval Climate Anomaly to the Little Ice Age.

Jones et al., 2016 (East Antarctica, Antarctic Plateau)
Over the 36-year satellite era, significant linear trends in annual mean sea-ice extent, surface temperature and sea-level pressure are superimposed on large interannual to decadal variability. Most observed trends, however, are not unusual when compared with Antarctic palaeoclimate records of the past two centuries.

Mark, 2016  (North Atlantic)
Much of the North Atlantic shows a maximum between 5000-8000 years B.P. Bradley et. al (2003) compiled a number of marine and terrestrial paleoclimatic proxies from throughout the Holocene which show fairly consistent broad trends in the climatic history of the North Atlantic region. Drawing from isotopic concentrations in ice cores, diatoms, pollen, and dendrochronological analyses, a clear period of elevated temperature, beginning at about 10,000 B.P and concluding at about 6,000 B.P precedes a slow and steady trend of cooling until present day


Otto and Roberts, 2016  (Northern Hemisphere)
In addition to temperature records limited to the past 4000 years, data for the past few thousand years were tested. When the data were explored over the past 10,000 years, greater fluctuations in the temperature can be seen with a significant rise in temperature beginning at about 11,000 BCE and ending at 2000 CE with a maximum at about 5,000 BCE.

Fortin and Gajewski, 2016 (Canadian Arctic)
A study of chironomid remains in the sediments of Lake JR01 on the Boothia Peninsula in the central Canadian Arctic provides a high-resolution record of mean July air temperatures for the last 6.9 ka …. Biological production decreased again at ~ 2 ka and the rate of cooling increased in the past 2 ka, with coolest temperatures occurring between 0.46 and 0.36 ka [460 and 360 years ago], coinciding with the Little Ice Age. Although biological production increased in the last 150 yr, the reconstructed temperatures do not indicate a warming during this time. … Modern inferred temperatures based on both pollen and chironomids are up to 3°C cooler than those inferred for the mid-Holocene.

Barbara et al., 2016  (Antarctic Peninsula)

Briner et al., 2016   (Greenland Ice Sheet)
The temperature decrease from the warmest to the coolest portions of the Holocene is 3.0 ± 1.0 °C on average (n = 11 sites). The Greenland Ice Sheet retracted to its minimum extent between 5 and 3 ka [5,000 and 3,000 years ago], consistent with many sites from around Greenland depicting a switch from warm to cool conditions around that time.
The temperature record, which integrates all seasons, shows rapid warming from the onset of the Holocene until ~9.5 ka [9,500 years ago], relatively uniform temperature at the millennial scale until ~7 ka [7,000 years ago], followed by ~3.5 °C temperature decline to the Little Ice Age [1250-1850 C.E.], followed by ~1.5 °C warming to today.  [Today’s Greenland Ice Sheet temperatures are 2.0 °C colder than the Early and Middle Holocene] .  The record also shows centennial-scale variability on the order of 1-2 °C, and a ~3 °C temperature oscillation during the 8.2 ka event.

Brocas et al., 2016 (Tropical Atlantic)
[W]ithin the mid-LIG [Last Interglacial, ~125,000 years ago], a significantly higher than modern SST seasonality of 4.9°C (at 126 ka) and 4.1°C (at 124 ka) is observed. These findings are supported by climate model simulations and are consistent with the evolving amplitude of orbitally induced changes in seasonality of insolation throughout the LIG, irrespective of wider climatic instabilities that characterised this period.

Gjerde et al., 2016  (Norway)
The resulting Pw record is of higher resolution than previous reconstructions from glaciers in Norway and shows the potential of glacier records to provide high-resolution data reflecting past variations in hydroclimate. Complete deglaciation of the Ålfotbreen occurred ~9700 cal yr BP, and the ice cap was subsequently absent or very small until a short-lived glacier event is seen in the lake sediments ~8200 cal yr BP. The ice cap was most likely completely melted until a new glacier event occurred around ~5300 cal yr BP, coeval with the onset of the Neoglacial at several other glaciers in southwestern Norway. Ålfotbreen was thereafter absent (or very small) until the onset of the Neoglacial period ~1400 cal yr BP. The ‘Little Ice Age’ (LIA) ~650-50 cal yr BP [1350 to 1950] was the largest glacier advance of Ålfotbreen since deglaciation, with a maximum extent at ~400-200 cal yr BP, when the ELA was lowered approximately 200 m relative to today.

Yu et al, 2016 (Western Antarctica Peninsula)
The period at 900–600 cal B.P. was coldest as indicated by ice advance, abundance of kill ages from ice-entombed mosses exposed recently from retreating glacial ice, and apparent gap in peatbank initiation. Furthermore, the discovery of a novel Antarctic hairgrass (Deschampsia antarctica) peatland at 2300–1200 cal B.P. from the mainland Antarctic Peninsula suggests a much warmer climate than the present. … [T]he sea surface temperature record from Palmer Deep off Anvers Island suggests a pronounced climate warming of ~3°C at 1600–500 cal B.P. [Shevenell et al., 2011].

Solomina et al., 2016 (Caucasus Mountains)
The climate was warmer and glaciers were likely receding in the beginning of the past millennium CE (the “Arkhyz break in glaciation”). … In this pass, remains of wood radiocarbon dated to 700 ± 80 BP  (1180–1420 CE) were buried in a 1.5-m-thick layer of alluvium (Kaplin et al., 1971; Kotlyakov et al., 1973). Currently, the upper tree limit is located 800–900 m below this elevation. … According to indirect estimates based on pollen analyses, the upper tree limit in the “Arkhyz” period was 200–300 m higher than today (Tushinsky, Turmanina, 1979). The remains of ancient buildings and roads were also found in the Klukhorsky pass at an elevation of 2781 a.s.l. [above sea level] (Tushinsky et al., 1966), and the glacier was still present at this elevation in the mid 20th century.  …  [I]n Central and East Transcaucasia, there are artificial terraces at elevations where agriculture is not currently possible and that there are remnants of forests in places where forests have not grown since the 16th century CE. ...
Turmanina (1988), based on pollen analysis, suggested that, in the Elbrus area, the climate during the “Arkhyz” time was dryer and warmer than in the late 20th century by 1–2 °C. … Solomina et al. (2014) determined the Medieval warming in the Caucasus to be approximately 1 °C warmer than the mean of the past 4500 years. According to the Karakyol palynological and geochemical reconstructions, the warm period was long and lasted for five centuries. Considering the suggestion of Turmanina (1988) that it was also less humid, the likelihood that many glaciers, especially those located at relatively low elevation, disappeared is very high.  … The maximum glacier extent in the past millennium was reached before 1598 CE.  The advance of the 17th century CE, roughly corresponding to the Maunder Minimum, is recorded at Tsey Glacier. … General glacier retreat started in the late 1840s CE and four to five minor readvances occurred in the 1860s–1880s CE.  In the 20th century CE, the continued retreat was interrupted by small readvances in the 1910s, 1920s and 1970s–1980s.
Bolch et al., 2016   (Himalayas, Karakoram)
Glaciers in the Hunza Catchment (Karakoram) are in balance since the 1970s … Previous geodetic estimates of mass changes in the Karakoram revealed balanced budgets or a possible slight mass gain since the year ~ 2000. Indications for longer-term stability exist but no mass budget analyses are available before 2000. Here, we show that glaciers in the Hunza River basin (Central Karakoram) were on average in balance since the 1970s based on analysis of stereo Hexagon KH-9, SRTM, ASTER and Cartosat-1 data. Heterogeneous behaviour and frequent surge activities were also characteristic for the period before 2000.
Lundeen and Brunelle, 2016  (Idaho, United States)
Together, the proxies suggest that the early Holocene experienced larger than average snowpacks but very warm summers. Warmer than modern summer temperatures were maintained through much of the mid-Holocene, but snowpacks decreased dramatically, creating the most extreme xeric conditions in the Holocene between ~7100 and 6000 BP.
Spolaor et  al., 2016 (Arctic Ocean, Region)
Researchers have found that 8000 years ago the Arctic climate was 2 to 3 degrees warmer than now, and that there was also less summertime Arctic sea ice than today.
MacGregor et al., 2016  (Greenland Ice Sheet)
[T]he interior of the GrIS [Greenland Ice Sheet] is flowing 95% slower now than it was on average during the Holocene [the last 9,000 years].
Sun et al., 2016  (China)
Comparing the climate between the mid-Holocene and present in the Xi’an area, the MAT [mean annual temperature] was about 1.1°C higher than today and the AP [annual precipitaion] was about 278 mm higher than today, similar to the modern climate of the Hanzhong area in the southern Qinling Mountains.
Paus and Haugland, 2016  (Scandinavia)
Around [9,500 years ago], pine suddenly established vertical belts of at least 200 m. These represent the highest pine-forests during the Holocene, ca. 210–170 m higher than today when corrected for land uplift. By this, summer temperatures at least 1–1.3°C warmer than today are indicated for the early Holocene thermal maximum around [8,500 to 9,500 years ago].
Easterbrook, 2016  (Greenland)
In the past 500 years, Greenland temperatures have fluctuated back and forth between warming and cooling about 40 times, with changes every 25–30 years. … Comparisons of the intensity and magnitude of past warming and cooling climate changes show that the global warming experienced during the past century pales into insignificance when compared to the magnitude of profound climate reversals over the past 25,000 years. At least three warming events were 20–24 times the magnitude of warming over the past century, and four were 6–9 times the magnitude of warming over the past century.

Share this...FacebookTwitterTrick of the radiative forcing of 3.7W/m2 at the tropopause
by Kyoji Kimoto
Radiative forcing is defined as 3.7W/m2 for 2xCO2 at the tropopause by the IPCC Third Assessment Report (2001) to avoid the usage of the surface radiative forcing of around 1W/m2. It is greatly reduced from the radiative forcing of around 4W/m2 at the tropopause due to IR absorption overlap between CO2 and water vapor plentifully existing at the surface.
Kiehl & Ramanathan (1982) developed a basic idea of the IPCC trick to overcome Newell & Dopplick (1979) claiming a climate sensitivity of 0.24K with the surface radiative forcing of around 1 W/m2 as shown by the following history of the AGW theory.
1959: Plass wrote:
In addition, nearly all water vapor remains close to the ground, while carbon dioxide diffuses more evenly through the atmosphere. Thus throughout most of the atmosphere carbon dioxide is the main factor determining changes in the radiation flux.
 Wiscombe (2013) explains the Plass’s idea as follows in his lecture at NASA.
Plass also notes that CO2 greenhouse action is relatively unimpeded above 2-3km.
1967: Manabe & Wetherald obtained a climate sensitivity of 2.4K with one dimensional radiative-convective model (1DRCM) utilizing the fixed lapse rate assumption of 6.5K/km for 1xCO2 and 2xCO2 giving uniform warming throughout the troposphere and the surface. They did not mention the Plass’s idea that CO2 greenhouse effect is greatly reduced at the surface due to IR absorption overlap with water vapor because their careless assumption of the fixed lapse rate prevented their study from self-criticism of uniform warming (see Fig.2).
1975: Manabe & Wetherald obtained an averaged climate sensitivity of 2.9K and polar climate sensitivity of 7-9K with 3DGCM which is based on the 1DRCM study of Manabe & Wetherald (1967).
1979: Newell & Dopplick obtained a climate sensitivity of 0.24K with the surface radiative forcing of around 1 W/m2 to criticize Manabe & Wetherald (1975).
1979: Ramanathan et al. wrote:
For example, with a doubling of CO2, Manabe & Wetherald (1975) estimates an increase in surface temperature of 2.0-2.5K within equatorial regions. From Fig.5 the surface heating of 1.1 W/m2 at the equator, due to the radiative effects of doubled CO2, can cause a maximum surface warming of about 0.2K, and hence roughly 90% of the 2.0-2.5K surface warming obtained by Manabe & Wetherald (1975) is caused by the atmospheric feedback processes described above.
1981: Ramanathan obtained the following surface warming with the feedback mechanism shown by Fig.1 copied from his review in 1998.


1981: Hansen et al. showed a climate sensitivity of 1.9K with 1DRCM study following Manabe & Wetherald (1967) utilizing the radiative forcing of 4 W/m2.
1982: Kiehl & Ramanathan obtained the following results for 2xCO2 utilizing H2O continuum absorption in the 12-18 microns region.
Kiehl & Ramanathan wrote:
But, the influence of this H2O overlap with CO2 bands is relatively smaller on the radiative heating of the joint surface/troposphere system. In particular, the effect of CO2 increase on the radiative heating of the joint surface/ troposphere system is affected very little by the presence of the water vapor continuum in the 12-18 microns region. We stress the importance of considering the troposphere/ surface system as a whole, when analyzing the effects of increasing CO2. As pointed out recently by Ramanathan (1981), results based upon surface energy balance alone can lead to incongruous conclusions.”
From Hansen et al. (1981) and Kiehl & Ramanathan (1982), the radiative forcing for
2xCO2 is 4 W/m2 at the tropopause giving the no-feedback climate sensitivity of 1.2K with the sensitivity factor of 0.3K/(W/m2) based on Cess (1976) as follows:
 4 W/m2 x 0.3 K/(W/m2) = 1.2K
 Soden & Held (2006) shows climate sensitivity is 3K for 2xCO2 from the 14 GCM studies for the IPCC 4th Assessment Report (2007) as follows:
  Climate sensitivity = no-feedback sensitivity (Planck response) x feedbacks
= 1.2K x 2.5 = 3K

Here, feedbacks are water vapor, ice albedo, lapse rate and cloud feedback.
The no-feedback sensitivity is uniform warming throughout the troposphere and the surface, which is originated from the 1DRCM studies of Manabe & Wetherald (1967) and Hansen et al. (1981) utilizing the fixed lapse rate assumption of 6.5K/km for 1xCO2 and 2xCO2.
The 1DRCM studies, however, are fudged due to their strong dependence on lapse rate used according to Hansen’s idea expressed in an interview with Spencer Weart held on 23 October, 2000 at NASA here.
And Cess admits his mathematical errors of the derivation to obtain the sensitivity factor of 0.3 K/(W/m2) in Cess (1976) here and here.
Kiehl & Ramanathan (1982) is based on the joint surface/troposphere system which is originated from Cess (1976) and is in line with the 1DRCM studies giving uniform warming throughout the troposphere and the surface due to the fixed lapse rate assumption of 6.5K/km for 1xCO2 and 2xCO2. Since it is a blanket model, the OLR decrease at the tropopause heats the troposphere and the surface as shown by their conclusion above.
On the contrary, a radiation height change model is the orthodox AGW theory as shown by Mitchell (1989) and Held & Soden (2000). In Fig.2, radiation height increases from point a to point b due to increased opaqueness when CO2 is doubled. This decreases the temperature at the effective radiation height of 5km causing an energy imbalance between the absorbed solar radiation (ASR) of 240W/m2 and the outgoing long wave radiation (OLR) in Fig. 3.
In order to restore the balance of energy, the radiation temperature increases from point b to point c. Based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law, a warming of 1K at the effective radiation height is enough to remove the energy imbalance caused by the radiative forcing of 4 W/m2 for 2xCO2 in Fig. 2.
For the Manabe method, the surface temperature increases in the same degree of 1K utilizing the fixed lapse rate assumption of 6.5K/km in Fig. 2. It, however, is erroneous since the 1DRCM studies are fudged according to the Hansen’s idea above.
In contrast, Kimoto model follows Ramanathan (1981) giving the no-feedback sensitivity of 0.17K with the direct heating of 1.2W/m2 for 2xCO2 from the Stefan-Boltzmann law at the surface. It is also in line with Newell & Dopplick (1979) giving a surface climate sensitivity of 0.24K based on the surface radiative forcing of around 1W/m2 and the evaporation cooling from the surface of the ocean.
In conclusion, the surface warming should be calculated with the surface radiative forcing of around 1 W/m2 utilizing the Stefan-Boltzmann law at the surface. The upper troposphere warming nullifies the radiative forcing at the tropopause due to CO2 increase with restoring OLR which is decreased by the opaqueness increase of the atmosphere.

"Glacial lakes have grown rapidly around the world in recent decades, according to satellite images that reveal the impact of increased meltwater draining off retreating glaciers. Scientists analysed more than quarter of a million satellite images to assess how lakes formed by melting glaciers have been affected by global heating and other processes.  The images show the number of glacial lakes rose by 53% between 1990 and 2018, expanding the amount of the Earth the lakes cover by about 51%. According to the survey, 14,394 glacial lakes spread over nearly 9,000 square km of the planet’s surface. Based on the figures, the researchers estimate the volume of the world’s glacial lakes grew by 48% over the same period and now hold 156.5 cubic km of water. “Our findings show how quickly Earth surface systems are responding to climate change, and the global nature of this,” said Stephan Harrison, a professor of climate and environmental change at Exeter University. “More importantly, our results help to fill a gap in the science because, until now, it was not known how much water was held in the world’s glacial lakes.” Glacial lakes are an important source of fresh water for many of the world’s poorest people, particularly in the mountains of Asia and parts of South America. But the lakes also present a growing threat from outburst floods that can tear down villages, wash away roads and destroy pipelines and other infrastructure. The fastest-growing lakes are in Scandinavia, Iceland and Russia, which more than doubled in area over the study period. Because many of the lakes are relatively small, the rise in volume is not substantial on a global level. Elsewhere, such as in Patagonia and Alaska, glacial lakes grew more slowly, at about 80%, but many of the lakes in these regions are vast, making the absolute increase in water volume huge. According to the report, published in Nature Climate Change, three of the largest Patagonian lakes grew at a much slower rate, but still reached 3,582 square km in 2018, up 27 square km since 1990. In other regions, the picture was more variable. In the north of Greenland, glacial lakes were growing rapidly, in line with global heating being more extreme in the Arctic. In south-west Greenland, some glacial lakes had shrunk, but often this was because they had already drained. Though meltwater is crucial for many communities living in valleys beneath glaciers, sudden outbursts from glacial lakes can be devastating. Writing in the journal, the scientists highlight particular threats to hydroelectric power plants in the Himalayas; the Trans-Alaska pipeline, which traverses mountains hosting glacial lakes; major roadways such as the Karakoram highway between China and Pakistan, a corridor that carries billions of dollars of goods annually. “As lakes get bigger there is more water in them to drain quickly and produce glacial lake outburst floods,” Harrison said. “These are a real hazard in many valleys connected to retreating glaciers in parts of the Himalayas and Andes, for example. “Such glacial lake outburst floods, or GLOFs, have killed tens of thousands of people over the past century and destroyed valuable infrastructure such as hydroelectric power schemes. However, this is a complex issue. Some lakes become less vulnerable to GLOF triggers as they get bigger, but the more water that is available will tend to make the GLOF worse if one occurs.”"
"Can your individual behaviour make a real difference to the environment? And should you be expected to voluntarily change your life in the face of our worsening environmental crises? Some argue this emphasis on personal responsibility is a distraction from the real culprits: companies and governments. We often treat the decisions to find alternative ways of living more sustainably and to pursue political resistance against big polluters and inactive governments as separate. But our recent research found that the relationship between alternatives and resistance is really far more complex. One can often lead to the other. Previous studies have shown that taking individual responsibility for the environment or developing green alternatives often go hand in hand with political action. Our research suggests that this relationship can form over time, and that when people change their lifestyles for environmental reasons this can galvanise their political action more generally. But we also found that this doesn’t always happen and that bringing the two together can be difficult. Our first study, carried out with Soetkin Verhaegen of UCLouvain in Belgium, looked at the environmental actions of a group of over 1,500 politically interested Belgians between 2017 and 2018. We found that citizens who took individual actions such as buying ethical products, changing how they travelled or producing their own food or energy, became more politically active over time. This included interacting with political institutions (for example, contacting elected politicians) and other actions such as taking part in protests. Our research suggests that taking individual responsibility for the environment increases your concern for it, which in turn motivates you to participate in other forms of action. While the effect was quite small, this seems to be good news for environmental movements. It shows that when people (at least the politically interested ones) can be motivated to adopt modest lifestyle changes, they can, in turn, become politically active in more a general sense. Yet on a practical level, trying to encourage both individual alternatives and political resistance isn’t easy, as we found in our study of two organisations promoting local food and energy systems in Manchester in the UK. As well as having limited time, the organisations found political activism sometimes conflicted with their aim of promoting alternative lifestyle projects to the broadest possible audience. As one interviewee put it: “If we’re trying to influence the uptake of solutions, then being seen as the opposition … isn’t particularly productive.”  However, we’ve also seen how bringing alternatives and resistance together can be done, and that its success can depend on location. In a series of in-depth interviews with environmental organisers in Bristol, we found the activists strongly benefited from their city’s compact size and layout (when compared to Manchester). Being more likely to bump into people from other activist groups means that, according to one interviewee, “your socialising is political”. The result was that activists in Bristol were better at maintaining relationships between different groups and at keeping the social side of activism going than in Manchester. This enabled a crossover of participants between the alternatives and resistance sides of the movement. Some started growing their own food and ended up defending their allotments against urban developments. Others who were initially protesting against supermarkets ended up in a food-growing scheme. Pursuing alternatives also helped sustain the resistance activities. This was both because the alternatives often involved a more positive experience and because they made it easier to point to viable solutions during environmental protests. So from a campaigner’s point of view, there’s little evidence that promoting alternative lifestyle choices and political resistance are mutually exclusive. In fact, in many cases the two feed into each other in positive ways, especially in the form of spillover from participation in one form of action to another. The effect we found was quite small and spillover will certainly not happen automatically. But that suggests there’s an important role for organisers to stimulate it further. Different organisations are needed to provide both personal and political activities and encourage more (and more diverse) people to get involved. For most ordinary people concerned, the debate over the effectiveness of taking individual responsibility for the environment is likely to continue. Our research at least suggests that people motivating each other to take personal action doesn’t undermine a broader environmental project. But it’s still important for people to discuss what other action is needed, and to look for or even organise ways to put pressure on powerful actors to take their responsibility.

 ** _Monday’s Experts always know what’s best. Always tell you what you should’ve done – Weddings, Parties, Anything._**



There’s certainly no shortage of Monday’s Experts in the wake of Australia’s bushfire crisis. Everyone from politicians to activists to That Bloke Down the Pub is more than willing to offer the benefit of their boundless wisdom and expertise to anyone who’ll put up with them.



Even while the fires were raging, the Greens and their useful idiots were furiously whipping their hobby horse, shrieking that climate change, and climate change only, was the sole culprit. Ignore fuel loads in state-managed forests, ignore the dead hand of Green-inspired land-management regulation, and definitely, definitely ignore the maniacs running amok with matches in the tinder-dry bush. State governments and their bureaucrats have been happy enough to go along with that particular narrative, as it conveniently lets them off the hook.



But other Monday’s Experts who just happen to have a bit more expertise than an inner-city Green are offering their own wisdom of hindsight.



Six farmers are preparing to take legal action against the state government, arguing a massive bushfire in northern NSW could have been prevented if more hazard reduction had been allowed.



In what could be the first class action after this summer’s horror bushfire season, graziers hit by the August blaze in the Guy Fawkes National Park, west of Coffs Harbour, say it was “a disaster waiting to happen”.



Beef farmer **Tony Brazier** , who lives just outside Guyra, said[…]Mr Brazier said since cattle had been prohibited from grazing in national parks, the fire threat had increased significantly resulting in a firestorm that tore through the park.



“But the big problem is that there was just no burning, everyone is too scared to burn anything because they think they will end up in jail,” he said.



There’s a whiff of self-interest for graziers there, for sure, but also a huge dollop of truth. Rural landowners who’ve cleared fuel loads on their properties have been subjected to relentless lawfare by local government authorities, sometimes racking up hundreds of thousands of dollars in costs and fines.



In any case, fire is inherently uncontrollable. Even the best-managed burn can get away. Acrimony and almost-certain lawsuits follow. Even when a burn behaves, townsfolk, especially “tree changers” unfamiliar with the norms of rural life, complain about the smoke. Then there are [the activists who try to prevent burns altogether](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/01/taxpayer-funded-media-controlling-the-fires-narrative/) – as well as banning other long-standing rural practices, such as cattle grazing in national parks.



The lawyer representing the farmers, **Peter Jackson** , said some graziers were seeking compensation while others wanted to see significant changes made to land clearing policies.



Mr Jackson said the farmers had been told by National Parks that the fire was “blacked out”, meaning extinguished, after three days only for a burning log to roll down a hill and reignite it.



It then quickly became a firestorm that swept across the state.



“My clients have been fighting fires for decades but they say they have never seen anything like it,” Mr Jackson said.



“They want to protect the biodiversity of the national park and certainly don’t want to destroy it but since the park has been locked up, the fuel loads have increased significantly.”



Farmers are relentlessly demonised by the Green lobby. But the same Green lobby who coo over Aboriginal practices which were intended to manage the land for human benefit, refuse to even countenance the idea that farmers might be similarly motivated or have similar expertise.



Sure, graziers are looking out for their own interests, here – not least their interest in not seeing their land reduced to a blackened wasteland – but they also have generations of experience that makes them worth at least listening to.

"GREENVILLE, Del.  —   The state beverage of Delaware is milk, and as Angelina Squillace was stocking it in a grocery store here, she paused, in response to a question, to think about what else defined this state. “It’s like, tax free,” said Ms. Squillace, 17, referring to her home state’s zero percent sales tax, “and it’s Joe Biden. That’s really what it is. ” The handover of presidential power in Washington, 110 miles away, has brought joy to many in the country and thoroughly unsettled others. But here in Delaware, it foretold an especially bittersweet adjustment. The end of the vice presidency of Joseph R. Biden Jr. has dimmed an   spotlight on a state that, even its own residents admit, can sometimes get lost in the shuffle. “There’s this big joke, people say, ‘ ? ’” Karen Friday, 48, a   mother in Hockessin, Del. said as she waited recently at the Wilmington train station  —   which is named after Mr. Biden  —   for a friend to disembark. “He’s contributed so much to letting people know who we are. ” “I think,” said Bob Jones, 72, a shoe shiner at the station, “he’s the   person we ever had. ” Mr. Biden was born in Scranton, Pa. (and he speaks of it often) but he moved to Delaware as a young teenager and has considered it home, more or less, since. Over some 36 years of commuting from here to his job in the United States Senate, and after eight years as the No. 2 man in the Obama administration, Mr. Biden has kept his indelible link, forged by family and framed by tragedy, to the nation’s   state. He owns a home here in Greenville, close to Wilmington, and is expected to keep spending weekends here even though he also plans to have a house in Washington. For decades, he has been Delaware’s biggest cheerleader, and the state has loved him right back. “One of the historians who specialized in Delaware history pointed out that he probably ranks in Delaware history at the same level as the Delaware leader during the Revolution who rode to Philadelphia to sign the Declaration of Independence,” said Joseph Pika, an emeritus professor of political science at the University of Delaware, referring to Caesar Rodney, who was a lawyer, a member of the Continental Congress and the president (governor in modern political view) of Delaware during most of the Revolutionary War. “There are people who if he put his foot in his mouth would say, ‘Oh that’s typical of Biden,’” Mr. Pika said. “That’s about the harshest criticism you would hear. ” The University of Delaware is Mr. Biden’s alma mater and he is planning some kind of partnership as he   civilian life, although the details are still hazy. “This is a time we could make history,” said Dennis Assanis, the president of the university. “He’s one of our most prominent alumni. ” Mr. Biden, who is 74, is also planning to have a center at the University of Pennsylvania, and to work on a cancer initiative. Mr. Biden had been a lawyer and a councilor for New Castle County  —   one of Delaware’s three  —   when he won his upstart bid for Senate in 1972, at the age of 29. His first wife and their daughter were killed in a car crash that injured his two sons. Mr. Biden took his oath of office at the bedsides of his sons and decided to come home every night, binding the state to his grieving family. “Everyone could relate to the tragedy that he experienced,” Mr. Pika said. He became a ubiquitous presence on the Amtrak train, commuting between Washington and Wilmington as he climbed the ranks in the Senate, and mounted his own failed bids for the presidency before he became the vice president in 2009 as Barack Obama’s running mate. “We’re not a big state that’s produced a lot of presidents or vice presidents  —   or any presidents or vice presidents,” said Mike Castle, the former Republican governor and congressman for Delaware who described himself as a friend of Mr. Biden’s, “and all of a sudden, one of our residents is plucked out to be the vice president of the United States. ” “It’s a real honor for us,” Mr. Castle added. Mr. Biden’s family remained closely linked to the state. His second wife, Jill, was a longtime community college teacher here (she now teaches in Virginia) and their daughter, Ashley, now runs a nonprofit organization in the state. But no one was more prominent than his son, Beau Biden, who became the state’s attorney general and was widely expected to become the state’s governor, before he died of a brain tumor in 2015. “Joe Biden stood for eight hours one day as mourners visited to give their condolences,” Mr. Pika said. “It was felt by the entire state. ” Other American statesmen have, of course, become closely associated with their home states. Everyone knows Abraham Lincoln is from Illinois, that the Bushes call Texas home, and that Ronald Reagan lived in California. But this is a state with a population the size of a large city, and one that so many Americans have simply driven through without stopping. So Mr. Biden, who knows everyone and always came back, looms large. “We really haven’t had national figures,” said Bill Gee, a commercial and real estate lawyer who sometimes sees Mr. Biden at the Wilmington Country Club, and had voted for him for Senate despite being a Republican. “It was kind of nice for little Delaware. ” Mr. Gee, like others here, pointed out that Delaware “punches above its weight,” like with the tax laws that have drawn scores of businesses to incorporate here. It is close to Washington, Baltimore and Philadelphia. And there are nice beaches. “If you said name something in Delaware, a lot of people would know DuPont,” Mr. Gee said, referring to the chemical company. “After that, hm, people know that we’re one of the large   states. ” While the state’s corporate clout is significant, it has, like much of the rest of country, shed manufacturing jobs, and even DuPont has had layoffs in recent years. Mr. Biden has “outlasted the DuPont reputation,” said Nancy Karibjanian, a former reporter who has covered Mr. Biden, and the director of the University of Delaware’s Center for Political Communication. “The sales tax is nice, but I think Joe Biden is in a category of his own. ” It helps that, in a state so small, it is easy to get to know the power players  —   and just about everyone else, too. Indeed, nearly every single person approached at random by a reporter on a recent day at Wilmington’s train station claimed to have personally met the man. “The very first year he ran for Senate, he was out campaigning in a strip shopping center, all by himself,” Margo Johnson, a retiree, recalled. “He just chatted it up with my mother. She just thought he was wonderful. ” Tyrone Young, 63, a denture maker, said he had waited in line for an hour and a half to pay his respects to the Biden family after Beau died. “That’s honor, dignity, respect,” Mr. Young said, adding that the Bidens “showed you the same thing. ” Mr. Biden speaks often of his love for the state. When he arrived at the train station here on Friday, after President Trump’s inauguration, he made a characteristic Joycean reference: “When I die, Delaware will be written on my heart. ” He sounded a similar note eight years ago, during a speech days before he and Mr. Obama were inaugurated. “Delaware,” Mr. Biden said, “I’d not be taking this journey were it not for you. ”"
"**China has condemned what it called an ""appalling attack"" by protesters on Hong Kong's justice secretary in London on Thursday evening.**
Teresa Cheng fell and was treated for an arm injury in hospital after being jostled by about 30 supporters of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement.
Chinese official Geng Shuang said some in the UK ""supported violent acts... to create chaos"" in its former colony.
Hong Kong has been racked by five months of anti-government protests.
The campaign started in opposition to a now-withdrawn plan to allow extradition to mainland China, but it has since morphed into wider demonstrations backing democracy and opposing the actions of the police.
The protests have continued unabated - Friday was the fifth consecutive day - and have often turned violent. On Thursday, a 70-year-old man died after being hit by a brick thrown during clashes. A murder inquiry has been opened.
Hong Kong meanwhile confirmed it had entered its first recession for a decade, with the economy shrinking 3.2% in July to September, compared with the previous quarter.
The justice secretary had been in Camden, north London, to promote Hong Kong as a dispute resolution and deal-making hub.
Video showed her walking towards a lecture at the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators (CIArb) when she was surrounded by a group of protesters.
Some held signs and shouted ""murderer"" and in the melee, Ms Cheng fell to the ground.
London's Metropolitan Police said they were investigating an allegation of assault and no arrests had yet been made.
""A woman was taken to hospital by London Ambulance Service suffering an injury to her arm,"" a statement said.
In a statement, CIArb said Ms Cheng had been ""assaulted by a crowd"".
But one of the protesters told the Guardian she had slipped trying to escape from the crowd and ""nobody laid a hand on her"".
Tom Tugendhat, chair of parliament's foreign affairs committee, condemned the behaviour of the protesters.
Ministers ""visiting the UK should be able to go about their business free from abuse and assault. This is not right"", he tweeted.
Mr Geng, China's foreign ministry spokesman, said the attack was ""directly related to certain British politicians confusing right from wrong on the Hong Kong issue and their support for violent acts, giving a platform to those who are anti-China and want to create chaos in Hong Kong"".
He said if the UK did not alter its approach ""and continues to add fuel to the fire, sow discord and instigate others"" it would ""bring calamity on itself"".
He urged the UK to ""bring the culprits to justice and... also protect the safety and integrity of all Chinese people in the nation"".
Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam also condemned the protesters in the UK, saying ""the savage act breached the bottom line of any civilised society"".
Ms Cheng's office said she ""castigates the violent mob in London causing her serious bodily harm on her way to an event venue"".
Protesters say Ms Cheng played a key role in pushing for the extradition bill.
Protesters, including thousands of office workers, were on the streets again on Friday, many of them chanting ""stand with Hong Kong"".
A number of roads were blocked and there was more disruption on the underground rail system. Black-clad protesters also continued to occupy university campuses.
It comes a day after Chinese President Xi Jinping warned the protests were threatening the ""one country, two systems"" policy under which Hong Kong retains a high level of autonomy and personal freedom unseen in mainland China.
Police in Hong Kong are treating as murder the death of the 70-year-old hit by a brick during unrest in the border town of Sheung Shui on Wednesday.
The government said the cleaner was on a lunch break when he was struck by ""hard objects hurled by masked rioters"".
Video purported to be of the incident shows two groups throwing bricks at each other before the man falls to the ground.
On Monday, a police officer shot an activist in the torso with a live bullet, and a man was set on fire while arguing with anti-government protesters.
A week ago, Alex Chow, a 22-year-old student, died after falling from a building during a police operation."
"In February 1997, Dr. Terence Kealey published his book titled The Economic Laws of Scientific Research. He was then lecturing at Cambridge University as a Clinical biochemist.
He points out that nearly all of the great leaps of classical science – astronomy, newtonian physics, the massive development of alternating electricity, relativity, atomic theory and practice we made by individuals or privately funded research efforts.
The purpose of the book assesses the myth that government-funded science works economically. Terence Kealey argues that the free market approach rather than that of state funding is what produces results which benefit humanity.
The European edition of the Wall Street Journal wrote: “It is the first book by a practising scientist to challenge the orthodoxy for decades, and should be read by those who are involved in science or merely wish to promote it.”
Today Dr. Terence Kealey is Vice Chancellor at the University of Buckingham.
The University of Buckingham is the only degree-awarding independent university in the United Kingdom. The university has the highest ranking in the UK for student satisfaction. The university’s five main faculties are Law, Humanities, Business, Science, and Medicine. Each of these is presided over by a Dean of Studies, an academic leader in their field.
The book shows the fatal flaws of the states indulgence in research through its own agencies such as the CSIRO.

Andrea Vance looks like she is putting her hand up for a leading role in the Media Party. [She has an opinion piece](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/opinion/120071642/shane-jones-legitimises-the-dishonest-tactics-of-climate-deniers-antivaxxers-and-prolifers) that is as vitriolic as it is wrong, about Shane Jones and his alleged racism:



[…] in this era of [alternative facts](https://www.stuff.co.nz/world/americas/88667409/lies-falsehoods-donald-trumps-team-prefers-to-say-alternative-facts), it’s not hard to see why interest groups indulge in misinformation when constructing and communicating their political message.



The tone is set from the top. And when politicians like Shane Jones spray out [virulently racist, and blatantly false, claptrap about Indian students](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/119966947/shane-jones-racist-and-must-be-reprimanded-simon-bridges-says?rm=a) you cannot blame others for losing their moral compass in public discourse. 



Politicians ought to use restraint and reason in their statements. As Prime Minister, responsible for the conduct of ministers in her Government, Jacinda Ardern should have censured him.



Jones will be undeterred – this kind of messaging is easy and effective. Lobbing incendiary charges and stoking fears against a minority guarantees attention. 



For all the critical commentary, Jones knows there will be a rump of supporters cheering him on. To condemn a politician for racism is to implicitly accuse their supporters of harbouring the same bigoted tendencies. They will rail against the cult of political correctness.



The fact that there was no evidence, or justification for his vague claims got a bit lost in the howl of outrage.



But allowing false claims and a disregard for truth to seep into policy debates is destructive and irresponsible. It legitimises the tactics of climate deniers, anti-vaxxers and other groups who don’t have truth on their side.



If Shane Jones can spit out a xenophobic tirade, on national television – and ‘get away’ with it, can we really expect pressure groups not to blur the lines between between fact and opinion, informed argument and blustering conjecture?



The [Media Party](https://thebfd.co.nz/the-bfd-dictionary/) is becoming completely unhinged.



Shane Jones merely pointed out that a lot of dodgy [“curry munchers” ](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/03/how-national-were-trapped-into-backing-dodgy-curry-munchers/)had their immigration applications rejected. That is a hard, incontrovertible fact. It happened and there are serious issues in tertiary institutions that are enabling this behaviour. All Jones has done is to say that it needs to stop.



No one is actually arguing that it happened or otherwise. Not a peep about the actual facts of the issue. Yet Andrea Vance has the temerity to accuse Jones of having a fact-free argument. They are not false claims and for her to make her own false claims in that regard shows that the Media Party hasn’t learned from overseas experience. Saying something is so doesn’t make it so when pesky details called facts are raised. The Media Party are telling Jones he is wrong because he pointed out a fact.



It isn’t racist, no matter how hard the vested interests howl that it is. Facts are facts and Shane Jones has that on his side.



And that is before politics enters the fray. It is only globalists who howl about racism when others point out facts. They want unfettered immigration which, perversely, is what has landed us all with the coronavirus. Shane Jones is merely saying what many in the streets of Auckland and any other city with large migrant populations are saying. For every howling and mewling globalist, or National party sycophant who goes on about racism, there are plenty more people who will be liking what that Jones boy from Northland is saying. They will be saying over their beers at the BBQ or the pub that New Zealand doesn’t need any more dairy owners, or liquor store owners or even more Uber drivers. They’ll be saying Jones is right and the whingers, including the Prime Minister, are wrong.



Jacinda Ardern has implored voters to prove Shane Jones wrong, but what is more likely is that the voters will prove that they like what Jones is saying. Then what will the Prime Minister say?

"**Hong Kong's district elections have delivered an unprecedented landslide victory for the city's pro-democracy movement, leaving the government reeling.**
For months, young people have visibly been at the helm of demonstrations, protests and clashes, sparked by a now-withdrawn extradition bill which morphed into a broader cry for democracy and police accountability.
These elections saw many young and novice candidates take on political heavyweights - in the name of Hong Kong's democracy movement - and emerge victorious.
Here are four of their stories.
In the months since the protest movement began, Jimmy Sham has been beaten up twice - by unknown hammer and bat-wielding assailants for reasons that still remain unclear.
Nevertheless the 32-year-old leader of the Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF), one of Hong Kong's largest pro-democracy groups which has organised several major rallies, has emerged one of the biggest winners.
He won his seat in the Lek Yuen constituency by almost 1,000 votes over the incumbent Michael Wong of the pro-Beijing Civil Force.
Mr Sham might have risen to prominence as leader of the CHRF but he has been an active LGBT rights campaigner for years and even in the last few months his gay identity became the focus of attacks on him on social media.
The most recent physical assault on Mr Sham in October left him lying in the street and covered in blood. The CHRF linked that attack to government supporters.
He persisted with his vocal campaign and is quoted as saying after his victory: ""No matter how strong Carrie Lam is I hope she can comply with the wishes of the people, fulfil the five demands [and] give the youngsters a chance.""
Karrine Fu won her Fort Street constituency by the smallest of margins - just 59 votes.
The 23-year-old was born and bred in the Fortress Hill area. She is a third-generation Fujianese Hong Konger - so is part of a community who came over from China's Fujian province and which is known to be more conservative and pro-Beijing.
It makes her victory all the more remarkable.
She defeated the incumbent, 45-year-old Hung Lin Cham, a secondary school teacher representing the main pro-Beijing Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB), who won the past three elections without contest.
He is also of Fujianese descent and has held sway over this relatively conservative pro-Beijing stronghold since 2007.
According to news outlet HK01, Ms Fu, an arts graduate from the University of Hong Kong, decided to run in the district elections precisely because of the anti-government protests.
She told the news outlet that she felt ""encouraged"" to do more for Hong Kong as a result of the movement. Reports say she was offered a job in a school but turned it down because of the protests.
By winning the Sai Wan constituency last night, a fourth-year politics and public administration student took out one of the biggest political scalps of the election: Horace Cheung.
Mr Cheung is the vice-chairman of the DAB - Hong Kong's largest pro-Beijing party.
Jordan Pang made his name with his articulacy and passionate advocacy of the protesters' cause as leader of the Hong Kong University Students' Union.
He defeated Mr Cheung, a 45-year-old solicitor who had represented Sai Wan since 2011, by almost 800 votes: a man who was known as a ""triple councillor"" having held positions in the district council, Legislative Council and Executive Council.
His opponent said the results of the elections were ""not much to do with local district work"".
In a statement on Facebook, Mr Pang said he was ""humbled"" by the victory but added that there was ""still a long road ahead"".
The 21-year-old is one of several high-profile student leaders who have received threatening anonymous messages. Mr Pang said he was told to surrender to the police, or face death - but he continued with his campaign.
""The victory today and record-shattering turnout rate reflects exactly the voice of the people amidst this critical plight,"" he told supporters.
In what is being celebrated as perhaps the most unexpected victory by pro-democracy activists, Cary Lo of the Democratic Party unseated pro-Beijing politician Junius Ho.
The 37-year-old compliance officer beat Mr Ho - one of the city's most controversial politicians - by around 1,200 votes in the Lok Tsui constituency.
Mr Ho, a 57-year-old lawyer, became a member of Hong Kong's Legislative Council in 2016 and so he remains a lawmaker.
But he has recently become a hate-figure among pro-democracy activists, who accused him of helping orchestrate an attack on activists and passers-by in the district of Yuen Long.
He denies such links but the anger persisted and earlier this month he was stabbed while campaigning by a man who pretended to be one of his supporters.
After the results came out, images of crowds apparently cheering his defeat were circulated on social media.
""I'm moved, the opposition overwhelmed me with congratulations,"" said Mr Ho on social media. ""It is not a bad things to transform their brutality to harmony.""
As far as the man who defeated him goes, his Facebook campaign page features footage of him jogging along Hong Kong's waterfront amid friendly exchanges with residents.
For all his campaign cunning, many analysts would argue that simply being an alternative to Junius Ho was Cary Lo's major advantage."
"**Hong Kong will hand out cash to adult permanent residents, to help boost spending and ease financial burden.**
As part of the annual budget, $10,000 Hong Kong dollars ($1,280; Â£985) was announced for about seven million people over the age of 18.
The territory's economy has been battered by months of violent political unrest, and more recently suffered from the impact of the coronavirus.
The city has had 81 confirmed cases of the virus and two deaths.
""Hong Kong's economy is facing enormous challenges this year,"" Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Wednesday.
""After careful consideration, I have decided to disburse HK$10,000 to Hong Kong permanent residents aged 18 or above, with a view to encouraging and boosting local consumption on the one hand, and relieving people's financial burden on the other,"" Mr Chan said.
The individual handouts are part of a HK$120bn relief package to ease the impact of the protests and virus on the economy.
Authorities will also lower public housing rent and there will be rebates in salary and property taxes.
The budget deficit is projected to rise to nearly $18bn by 2021 - a record for the territory.
Hong Kong had previously announced a relief fund for sectors that have suffered because of the outbreak, including cash handouts for businesses like restaurants and travel operations.
The territory's economy is suffering from months of political unrest which has seen pro-democracy activists in often violent clashes with the police.
In the last weeks, the threat of the coronavirus spilling over from the mainland has slowed down much of public life and dealt a serious blow to the tourism sector.
The financial hub is also reeling from the ongoing US-China trade war, slowing down trade between the world's two largest economies.

What is electric cars’ dirty little secret? Is it the batteries made with minerals [dug up by children](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/09/bdf-transcript-mike-hosking-on-why-evs-are-a-very-bad-idea/) in dirty, dangerous, slave-like conditions? Is it the greenhouse gas 1,400 times more potent than CO2 [which is used as a coolant](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/20140319/electric-cars-have-dirty-little-secret) by Chevy, Nissan and Tesla?



It’s something – several somethings in fact – which, whilst perhaps not as awful as child miners (a shameful burden shared by all manner of modern devices), demolishes the smug superiority assumed by the wealthy boomers who are the EVs’ most enthusiastic market.



First off, despite the endless spruiking by the bourgeois greenies of the legacy media, **almost nobody actually bothers with EVs**. Even in Norway, the poster child for EV spruikers, only nine percent of buyers would purchase an EV if the taxpayer wasn’t carrying $70,000 of the cost.



Battery-powered electric vehicles are fairly popular in urban China and California, as well as a few countries that heavily subsidise their drivers. But globally, fewer than 0.3 per cent of all cars are pure electric, and across Europe, BMW says, customers don’t want them.



For all their chest-puffing about “fairness”, EVs are luxury cars, driven almost exclusively by rich people who are driving with poor peoples’ taxes.



Unsurprisingly given the price tag, electric cars are often playthings for rich people. One US study shows the richest quarter of people receive almost all the public money spent on electric car subsidies. Moreover, electric cars in the US are driven fewer kilometres on average each year than conventional vehicles[…]Combine this with the fact 90 per cent of households that buy an electric car also have a conventional car that is driven farther, and a clear picture emerges: most electric vehicles are a second car used for shorter trips such as shopping and small errands — and for virtue signalling.



So, rich people using poor peoples’ money to drive their smugmobiles. **But, aren’t they saving the planet? In a word: _NO_.**



A new study from the International Energy Agency shows that an electric car with a 400km range and charged with electricity produced at the global average will have to be driven 60,000km just to pay off its higher CO2 emissions in production. That means a new electric car driven the average 11,200km each year will have paid off its carbon debt only after five years. The IEA hopes the world can reach 130 million electric cars in 10 years — a breathtaking ask given we have spent decades reaching just over five million. Even if we could do that, emissions would be reduced by only 0.4 per cent of global emissions. In the words of IEA director **Fatih Birol** , “If you think you can save the climate with electric cars, you’re completely wrong.”



[…]And surprisingly, more electric cars often mean more air pollution. In China, which is the world’s leading electric car market, a study reveals that because China’s coal power plants are so dirty, electric cars worsen local air: in Shanghai, pollution from an additional million electric-powered vehicles would kill nearly three times as many people annually as an additional million petrol-powered cars.



Expensive, bourgeois toys for smug, rich people, which do practically nothing for the environment while hoovering a river of taxpayer’s money. **Is there anything about EVs which shouldn’t make any decent person violently ill?**

At the Guardian’s “Comment is free” site, skeptical environmentalist Bjorn Lomborg has some tart words for the Nobel committee: 



This year’s Nobel Peace Prize justly rewards the thousands of scientists of the United Nations Climate Change Panel (the IPCC). These scientists are engaged in excellent, painstaking work that establishes exactly what the world should expect from climate change.   
  
  
The other award winner, former US vice president Al Gore, has spent much more time telling us what to fear. While the IPCC’s estimates and conclusions are grounded in careful study, Gore doesn’t seem to be similarly restrained.   
  
  
Gore told the world in his Academy Award‐​winning movie (recently labelled “one‐​sided” and containing “scientific errors” by a British judge) to expect 20‐​foot sea‐​level rises over this century. But his Nobel co‐​winners, the IPCC, conclude that sea levels will rise between only a half‐​foot and two feet over this century, with their best expectation being about one foot — similar to what the world experienced over the past 150 years. …



The IPCC engages in meticulous research where facts rule over everything else. Gore has a very different approach.

"By Viv Forbes, Chairman, The Carbon Sense Coalition.
Australian electricity consumers can look forward to soaring charges for electricity and blackouts if state and federal politicians continue to undermine the power grid by mandating and subsidising solar power generation.
Solar power can never produce continuous, predictable low cost power. It must always be supported by expensive power storage systems or by reliable power sources such as coal, gas, hydro or nuclear.
No matter how many millions of taxpayer money is poured into “research”, it can never solve the two fatal flaws of solar power.

Firstly, sunlight energy arrives in very dilute form, and thus needs vast areas of collectors to harvest significant energy. This results in high capital costs and much environmental disturbance. Solar power can light one 75-watt bulb for every card table of collectors (in the middle of the day only). How many card tables do we need to run the trains, factories, fridges, homes, heaters, hospitals and tools of a big city?
Secondly, the solar energy produced during daylight hours is constantly variable and unpredictable, and zero power is generated at night. As a result, solar power farms seldom produce more than an average of 15% of their rated capacity over a year and as low as 1% for a day or so.
In Australia, the maximum electricity demand occurs at about 6.30 pm in mid-winter in the big southern cities. The maximum solar power is generated at noon in mid-summer in clear northern deserts. If the nightly solar curfew is to be covered by solar power alone, this necessitates a vast area of collectors to provide grid power as well as charge a storage backup during the day and run it down at night. The scattered solar collectors also need a huge new transmission network. Such a system is inefficient and very costly.
More likely, however, is that the solar farms will be backed up by gas or coal power stations running on idle and wasting fuel and capital until they are needed to supply power during the nightly solar blackouts.
Solar energy has useful applications, but supplying the power grid is NOT one of them. Solar power can never supply the reliable low cost electricity needed for Australian cities and industries. In that application, it can only exist as a subsidised and troublesome appendage propped up by serious power sources such as coal, gas, nuclear or hydro.

"The UK’s official climate advisor, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), recently published a report outlining how to reduce the 12% of greenhouse gas emissions that come from land use by two thirds by 2050. Alongside recommending cutting meat and dairy consumption by 20%, the report calls for the annual creation of up to 50,000 hectares of broadleaf and conifer woodland for the next three decades. This would increase forest cover from 13% to at least 17% – a level not seen in Britain since before the Norman invasion. Reforestation at that rate would mean creating roughly the area of the city of Leeds every year for the next three decades. At typical stocking densities of 1,500 stems per hectare, the ambition is to establish some 2.25 billion additional trees. Given that the UK, as with most of Europe, is in the grip of ash dieback, a disease likely to prove fatal for many millions of native ash trees, the scale of the challenge is massive. On a crowded and intensively farmed island like Britain, unlocking a million and a half hectares of land will be no mean feat. But it’s not impossible – and is an unprecedented opportunity not only to tackle the climate crisis but also the biodiversity crisis that is every bit as detrimental to our wellbeing. One million and a half hectares is just 6% of the mainland UK’s land area. To give some sense of perspective on this, 696,000 hectares of “temporary grassland” were registered in 2019. So if land supply is not the problem, what is? Often it’s cultural inertia. Farmers are firmly rooted to the land and perhaps understandably reluctant to stop producing food and instead become foresters. But the choice need not be so binary. The intensification of agriculture has caused catastrophic declines in many species throughout the UK by reducing vast wooded areas and thousands of miles of hedgerows to small pockets of vegetation, isolating populations and making them more vulnerable to extinction.

      Rewild 25% of the UK for less climate change, more wildlife and a life lived closer to nature


 Integrating trees with the farmed landscape delivers multiple benefits for farms and the environment. Reforestation doesn’t have to mean a return to the ecologically and culturally inappropriate single-species blocks of non-native conifers, which were planted en masse in the 1970s and 1980s. Incentivised under tax breaks to secure a domestic timber supply, many of the resulting plantations were located in places difficult or in some cases impossible to actually harvest. Productive farmland needn’t be converted to woodland. Instead, that 6% of land could be found by scattering trees more widely. After all, more trees on farmland is good for business. They prevent soil erosion and the run-off of pollutants, provide shade and shelter for livestock, a useful source of renewable fuel and year-round forage for pollinating insects. The first tranche of tree planting could involve new hedgerows full of large trees, preferably with wide headlands of permanently untilled soils, providing further wildlife refuge. Where appropriate, new woody habitats can be created simply by stopping how the land is currently used, such as by removing livestock. This process can be helped by scattering seeds in areas where seed sources are low. But patience is a virtue. If people can learn to tolerate less clipped and manicured landscapes, nature can run its own course. A focus on deliberate tree planting also raises uncomfortable truths. Most trees are planted with an accompanying stake to keep them upright and a plastic shelter that protects the sapling from grazing damage. All too often, these shelters aren’t retrieved. Left to the elements, they break down into ever smaller pieces, and can be swept into rivers and eventually the ocean, where they threaten marine wildlife. Two billion tree shelters is a lot of plastic. The main reason for using tree shelters at all is because the deer population in the UK is so high that in many places, it is all but impossible to establish new trees. This also has serious implications for existing woodland, which is prevented from naturally regenerating. In time, these trees will age and die, threatening the loss of the woodland itself. Climate change, pests and pathogens and the lack of a coordinated, centrally supported approach to deer management means the outlook for the UK’s existing treescape is uncertain at best. An ecologically joined-up solution would be to reintroduce the natural predators of deer, such as lynx, wolves, and bears. Whether rewilding should get that far in the UK is still the subject of debate. Before that, perhaps the focus should be on providing the necessary habitat, rich in native trees. A positive response would be to implement the balanced recommendations, made almost a decade ago in a government review, of creating more new habitat, improving what’s already there, and finding ways to link it together. More habitats that are bigger, better, and more connected. But the UK is losing trees at increasing rates and not just through diseases. The recent removal of Victorian-era street trees in Sheffield and many other towns and cities is another issue to contend with. As the climate warms, increasing urban temperatures will mean citis need shade from street trees more than ever. Trees aren’t the environmental panacea that the politicians might have people believe – even if they do make for great photo opportunities – but we do need more of them. Efforts to expand tree cover are underway across the world and the UK will benefit from contributing its share. Hitting the right balance – some commercial forestry, lots of new native woodland and millions of scattered trees – will be key to maximising the benefits they bring.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe sun in December 2016, and a look ahead
By Frank Bosse and Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/summarized by P Gosselin)
In December solar activity was rather quiet, with the sunspot number at only 19.5.  The sun was spotless over 6 days, and already this month there have been 10 spotless days so far.
In December solar activity was only 35% of what the mean is for this month into a cycle.

Figure 1: Sunspot activity for solar cycle (SC) 24 (red) compared to the mean cycle (blue) and the comparatively very similarly behaving SC 5 (black) from the year 1798 to 1810.
We are now 97 months into SC 24 since it started in 2008. It is very clear just how much weaker than normal it has become. And it is in fact the third weakest cycle since observations began in 1755.

Figure 2: Comparison of all the solar cycles. The chart shows the accumulated sunspot number anomaly from the mean value.
No year of the current cycle reached the mean value:

Figure 3: The relative sunspot activity for each year of SC 24.
So far SC 24 has reached only 56% of the average activity of all cycles occurring since 1755.
For estimating what may be in store for SC 25, which is expected to begin around 2020, it is of great interest to look at the polar fields of the sun. The following chart of the arithmetic mean of the fields of both poles:

Figure 4: Plot of the solar polar field since 1977.
Here we see that both the polar fields and sunspots reached their maximum value fairly early in the cycle, approximately 3 years after reaching the zero-point and that the decline takes place until the 11th year on average. The current cycle reached its peak at about March 2013. The height of the maximum is a strong indicator of how strong the next cycle will be. From Figure 4 we see it will be about as strong as the current one, possibly a bit weaker.
The current weak activity is no one-time outlier, and also SC 25 will be a weak one. That means that the period after 2005 will be considerably different from the the strong activity period of SC 18-23.
Another observation in relation to the polar fields is interesting: The field strengths of both poles are in fact not completely independent of each other, but asymmetries can occur:

Figure 5 : Comparison of both polar fields. The smoothed field of the northern pole (blue) and the southern pole (red) are shown as values, as is the mean value (black).
In solar cycle 23, there was a switch in solar fields, which is normal. But during the current cycle there has been no switch in strength as the southern pole was the stronger pole over the entire time. This has never happened since satellite observations began in 1977, and means that the fields appear to be quite decoupled.
What does this decoupling mean? Could it be a sign for SC 25? The answer to this question is unknown because the satellite observations began only in 1977.
Yet, recently the results of a new study by Kalevi Mursula et al of the University in Oulu in Finland allow us to look back 100 years. Here the authors looked at the strength of coronal holes in order to get information about the polar fields since 1910. Coronal holes, like solar flares, are sources of plasma discharges from the sun and act to strengthen solar winds, which in turn impact the earth’s magnetic fields. What follows is an example image made by a space craft:

Examining archives on polar lights, which are caused by flares and coronal holes, the authors were able to trace back the strengths of the solar polar coronal holes. The result: they were predominant on the downside of the SC 18 and SC 19, with the peak in 1957 – and then followed the most active cycle of the systematic observation record.
The situation was entirely different after the peak of solar cycle 23, starting at about 2002. The authors conclude that both events mark records for the period since 1910 and are at the start and end of the long-term maximum of solar activity (see Figure 2) in the second half of the 20th century. With regards to the polar fields, solar activity shifted up a gear in the 1950s and then shifted down at the end of the century.
This is confirmed by the results of the study.
Stratospheric radiation up 11% over past 2 years
And the sun impacts the earth through its non-activity: The diminishing solar winds means the earth gets hit by more cosmic rays, which leads to opper atmospheric reactions which ultimately lead to the generation of gamma and X-rays — to which we are subjected to a greater extent than at times of a more active sun. We’ve reported frequently on the possible effects of cosmic rays on cloud formation. A comprehensive measurement program has been started to determine which dosage man receives and how much it changes with little solar winds. Here are the first results:

Figure 7: Radiation into the stratosphere during the course of diminishing solar activity, Source.
The solid gain of 11% growth in radiation clearly shows the effect of diminishing solar winds. Moving up into the stratosphere means increasing the dose of radiation by 80 times than that at sea level. A flight at 12,000 meters elevation impacts the the human body 50 times more than being at sea level. Such an increase on the earth’s surface would normally activate a variety of emergency responses. But the effects on the body of course depend on the exposure time. A ten-hour transcontinental flight has the same impact as about 20 days at the earth’s surface.
Therefore over the course of one’s life, over time an infrequent flier is far more effected by the much lower radiation at the surface that he is up in the atmosphere, and so there is no need to panic about flying.
Just how much will the present X-ray and gamma ray radiation rise until the solar minimum is reached? We will keep you up to date on this here as well!

"President Trump, who flew across the country on hundreds of nights during the 2016 campaign to sleep in his own bed, has now spent five straight days in the unfamiliar surroundings of the White House. His aides said privately that he seemed apprehensive about the move to his new home, but Mr. Trump has discovered there is a lot he likes. “These are the most beautiful phones I’ve ever used in my life,” Mr. Trump said in a telephone interview Tuesday evening. “The world’s most secure system,” he added, laughing. “The words just explode in the air. ” What he meant was that no one was listening in and recording his words. The president sat at his desk  —   the one used by former Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, Ronald Reagan and John F. Kennedy, among others  —   at the end of his fourth full day in office. His mornings, he said, are spent as they were in Trump Tower. He rises before 6 a. m. watches television tuned to a cable channel first in the residence, and later in a small dining room in the West Wing, and looks through the morning newspapers: The New York Times, The New York Post and now The Washington Post. But his meetings now begin at 9 a. m. earlier than they used to, which significantly curtails his television time. Still, Mr. Trump, who does not read books, is able to end his evenings with plenty of television. In between, Mr. Trump signs executive orders in the Oval Office and has meetings in the West Wing. “They have a lot of board rooms,” he said of the White House, an apparent reference to the Cabinet Room and the Roosevelt Room. The White House is the only property that Mr. Trump has slept in that is more famous than one of his own, and he seems in awe. Although he made his name building extravagant, gilded properties, the new president has marveled to aides about the splendor of the White House and the lengths he must walk to retrieve something from a   room. His preference during the day is to work in the Oval Office. And to stare at it, still. So do his staff members and relatives. “I’ve had people come in they walk in here and they just want to stare for a long period of time,” Mr. Trump said. Among modern American presidents, Mr. Trump may be best situated to work where he lives. For decades, he has lived in a penthouse apartment on the 58th floor of Trump Tower and taken an elevator down to the 26th floor, where he has a corner office with views of Central Park. Many presidents have complained of being cooped up inside the White House  —   George W. Bush in particular said he missed the outdoors  —   but Mr. Trump can go for days without breathing in fresh outside air. Mr. Trump’s wife, Melania, went back to New York on Sunday night with their    son, Barron, and so Mr. Trump has the television  —   and his old, unsecured Android phone, to the protests of some of his aides  —   to keep him company. That was the case after 9 p. m. on Tuesday, when Mr. Trump appeared to be reacting to Bill O’Reilly’s show on Fox News, which was airing a feature on crime in Chicago. At 9:25 p. m. Mr. Trump posted on Twitter: In the interview, Mr. Trump demurred when asked about whether it was hard having his family away from him, and he pointed to Thursday, when Mrs. Trump and Barron, who is finishing the school year in New York, are expected to return. “They’ll come down on weekends,” Mr. Trump said. “She’ll come down on Thursdays and stay. ” He said he was enjoying himself so far, despite his visible displeasure with the coverage of his inauguration and the first performance of his press secretary, Sean Spicer, who shouted at the news media and made numerous false statements about Mr. Trump’s inaugural crowds in the White House briefing room on Saturday. Mr. Trump and his chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, and his chief of staff, Reince Priebus, watched Mr. Spicer’s   on Monday while eating lunch in the West Wing dining room, where the president murmured approval of Mr. Spicer’s Monday performance and called his press secretary a “superstar. ” His first breakfast at the White House was Saturday morning  —   a buffet in the residence spread with fresh fruit, pastries and other treats  —   where his adult children and their families joined him. The kitchen has been stocked with the same types of snacks that Mr. Trump had on his private plane, including Lay’s potato chips. His oldest daughter, Ivanka, and her husband, Jared Kushner, the president’s senior adviser, stayed with him in the White House through Sunday. They left for their own new home at the end of the weekend to get their children ready for their new schools. Mr. Trump has not brought along any household staff from Trump Tower, an aide said. The president spent a part of Tuesday poring over artwork from the White House collections, settling on a portrait of Andrew Jackson  —   America’s first populist president, who has been invoked by Mr. Trump’s aides as inspiration  —   to hang in the Oval Office. “Now, I’m working,” Mr. Trump said in the interview, punctuating his focus by cataloging the work of the day: an executive order restarting the Keystone XL pipeline and his plans for   actions over the next days. Mr. Trump is in the meantime pondering his first break away from the White House, a potential trip to    his private club in Palm Beach, Fla. possibly the weekend of Feb. 3. Until then, he is breaking in the residence, which Mrs. Trump is still working on decorating. “It’s a beautiful residence, it’s very elegant,” Mr. Trump said, deploying one of his highest forms of praise. “There’s something very special when you know that Abraham Lincoln slept there,” Mr. Trump said. “The Lincoln Bedroom, you know, was his office, and the suite where I’m staying is actually where he slept. ” Mr. Trump was referring to the White House master bedroom, which is now his own. “Knowing all of that, it’s different, than, you know, just pure elegance and room size,” Mr. Trump said. “There’s a lot of history. ”"
"Carbon emissions from Great Britain’s electricity system plunged by more than a third during the coronavirus lockdown after renewable energy played its largest ever role helping to keep the lights on, according to a report. During the spring bank holiday weekend in May, the energy grid’s carbon intensity reached a record low of 21 grams of CO2 per kilowatt-hour due to a slump in energy demand triggered by lockdown measures and a surge in renewable energy. The quarterly report, undertaken by Imperial College London for Drax, one of the UK’s largest power generators, found that lockdown measures caused electricity demand in England, Scotland and Wales to fall by 13% in the second quarter, compared with the same months last year, which helped the share of renewables to grow by a third to 40% of the energy mix. The renewable energy data includes electricity generated by wind turbines, solar farms, hydropower projects and burning sustainably sourced wood pellets, known as biomass. The record renewables also led to Britain’s longest coal-free streak on record. The Covid-19 impact also caused electricity market prices to tumble by more than 40% to £23 per megawatt-hour while the carbon intensity of the electricity system fell by a fifth to an average of 153 grams of carbon per kilowatt-hour. Although electricity has become cheaper and greener in recent months, the energy system has become more expensive for National Grid to operate, according to the report. The electricity system operator has spent an average of £100m every month over the first half of the year paying companies to turn off their generation projects, or charge their batteries, when there is more electricity than the grid can use. Dr Iain Staffell of Imperial College London, and the lead author of the report, said the past few months have “given the country a glimpse into the future for our power system, with higher levels of renewable energy and lower demand make for a difficult balancing act”. “To help the country decarbonise further it is vital that flexible technologies which provide power and system stability play an increasing role in our grid,” he added. At the start of the decade, the cost of balancing the grid added about £1 per megawatt-hour to the cost of electricity shouldered by energy users. But in the last quarter the cost surpassed £5 per megawatt-hour for the first time, up more than a third higher than expected. The £100m cost includes a National Grid contract worth between £55m and £73m offered to the nuclear operator EDF Energy to halve the power output from the Sizewell B nuclear plant, Britain’s largest reactor. National Grid also warned earlier this year that it would need to pay wind turbines to turn off to avoid overloading the power grid while demand for electricity is low. • The headline of this article was amended on 31 August 2020 to remove a reference to ‘UK’ carbon emissions. The quarterly report relates only to electricity in Great Britain."
"When you think of the effects of climate change on wildlife, what’s the first image that pops into your mind? Perhaps it’s a lonely, starving polar bear desperately searching for food on a melting ice sheet, or a burnt koala struggling across the Australian bush as fires devastate its habitat. What you’re probably not picturing is a herd of wild camel relatives atop Chile’s warming mountain ranges.  Chile is home to two wild camelid species: the smaller vicuña, found in the Andean plains, and its larger cousin, the guanaco, found in deserts, shrublands and steppes across the country. Guanacos aren’t well known to many people outside Latin America, but you may know their woolly domesticated relatives, the llama and the alpaca. Guanacos of central Chile can be found in the mountainous Valparaíso Region on the border with Argentina, where they eke out a harsh existence in dry grassland. But, as these areas become drier due to climate change, guanacos are increasingly getting on the wrong side of their human neighbours. So how could a fluffy, non-threatening, llama-like herbivore cause problems with local communities? There have been increasing complaints from local Chilean livestock ranchers that guanaco population numbers have been expanding and are now competing with their livestock for grass. These complaints have risen in recent years as the effects of climate change have become more pronounced in the mountainous areas. As the climate warms, the usual habitat of dry, mountainous grassland that the guanacos inhabit is turning to desert, which means there’s less grass for guanacos to eat, so they’re having to travel down slopes to graze the pasture of livestock. We wanted to understand what was really happening here, so we interviewed the ranchers to understand what they thought was driving the conflict between people and guanacos. What we found is a troubling reminder that no corner of the world is likely to escape the strife that climate change will bring. Since the late 1970s, there has been a 3cm decline each decade in the amount of snow falling onto the mountains of Chile. In our study, the ranchers we spoke to felt that heavy snow used to regulate guanaco numbers in the winter but, as snowfall has declined, more are surviving each winter. With less snow on the mountains, ranchers said that guanacos were able to travel more easily between the mountain ranges, coming into contact with livestock who share their appetite for grass. In such a desolate place, good grazing is hard to come by. Ranchers who graze their livestock in vegas, the high-altitude wetland areas, felt that the guanacos had the upper hand over their cattle. Guanacos, they reasoned, could rely on a more varied diet and were able to move down the mountain to find better grazing in the vegas as their traditional grasslands dried up. But the vegas are changing too as the climate warms. One rancher explained: The guanaco survives because it eats very little grass, but they are also able to eat bushes, whereas cattle do not, they graze only grass. In conditions of scarcity guanaco will eat shrubs. Now the grass is almost at ground level, and the recent years with low precipitation have not helped either. The vegas are drying up, many have turned yellow and the cattle only graze the vegas. The vegas have shrunk and some have dried up, and that’s because of the drought and the lack of rain. Guanacos have long been hunted for their fibre and meat. The legs and feet of this species are also valued as traditional remedies for ailments such as facial paralysis, lung diseases and muscular-skeletal disorders. But hunting this species was banned in the 1990s. The ranchers explained that hunting of guanacos was common until the mid-1990s, particularly during the military occupation of the country from 1973 to 1990, when troops hunted guanacos for food. Many of the ranchers said they had eaten guanaco meat in the past and valued it for its taste and low cholesterol. The ranchers we spoke to felt that they had been abandoned by the local government, who they believed had favoured conservation of guanacos over the livelihoods of ranchers.

      When rewilding isn't mad: guanacos can transform the espinal of Chile


 Some of the ranchers wanted to reinstate hunting to control the number of guanacos, but the species is listed as “vulnerable” in Chile by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), due to the desertification of its habitat from climate change, over-hunting for its pelt and, now, competition for grazing habitat with livestock. It’s not clear how a sustainable hunting quota could be managed given these pressures. Ranchers also suggested that they should receive compensation for the grazing they were losing as guanacos ate more of the grass. As climate change alters environments such as the mountaintops of Chile there will be increased competition for resources between people and wildlife. The bush fires in Australia, widely claimed to have increased in severity in recent years due to climate change, have resulted in humans and wild animals competing for scarce water. These human-wildlife conflicts are likely to worsen as global temperatures rise, which is why it is so important that action is taken now to limit greenhouse gas emissions – to benefit people and wildlife.

"**A US law supporting pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong may unsettle trade talks with China, but is unlikely to derail them, analysts say.**
The US president has signed into law a bill that requires an annual review of Hong Kong's special status with the US.
Hong Kong has seen months of increasingly violent clashes between protesters and the police.
The law comes as the world's two largest economies are trying to end their trade war.
US President Donald Trump said he signed the law, known as the Human Rights and Democracy Act, ""out of respect for President Xi [Jinping], China, and the people of Hong Kong"".
China responded strongly, with its foreign ministry threatening ""counter-measures"" if the US continued ""going down the wrong path"".
Michael Hirson at Eurasia Group said that Mr Trump's signing of the bill ""will not derail trade negotiations"".
""To be sure, Beijing is angered at the US for interfering in what China considers its domestic affairs and for emboldening the protest movement,"" he said.
""But some of China's anger over the bill is posturing for the domestic audience, and Beijing will not be so upset as to let this stand in the way of a truce over trade.""
Analysts say the US and China both want to keep the negotiations from stalling, given that stakes are high.
They have been fighting a trade for more than a year, placing tariffs on billions of dollars of each other's goods.
China faces another round of US duties on 15 December, and if talks break down, these are likely to go ahead.
That would place an additional burden on an economy which is already growing at its slowest pace in decades.
The US also wants to avoid higher costs and economic hardship for American consumers, particularly ahead of US elections next year.
The December tariffs are concentrated on consumer goods and would therefore have ""a bigger impact on inflation and households than previous rounds of tariffs did"", said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics.
""The Trump administration appears reluctant to go ahead with the December tariffs because we're reaching the stage where tariffs are starting having a negative impact on the US economy,"" he added.
""There are still incentives on both sides to push for a deal, provided they can agree on the terms.""
The Human Rights and Democracy Act mandates an annual review to check if Hong Kong has enough autonomy to continue to justify its special status with the US.
Among other things, Hong Kong's special trading position means it is not affected by US sanctions or tariffs placed on the mainland.
The bill also allows for sanctions to be imposed ""on those responsible for human rights violations in Hong Kong"".
But analysts said the bill would have no immediate consequences.
""The US law calls on the administration to review Hong Kong's special status and to sanction Chinese officials for repression in Hong Kong, but [Mr] Trump is very unlikely to take action in either area,"" said Hirson.
US-China trade talks over the past year have been volatile. Sticking points have included how to enforce any deal that is agreed.
More recently, both sides seem to be nearing an initial so-called ""phase one"" deal, which will reportedly cover matters such as agricultural purchases, but avoid more sensitive structural issues.
A looming 15 December deadline has made the need for an agreement more urgent, but for some analysts, the passing of the Hong Kong rights law in the US has thrown a spanner in the works.
""All of the economic logic in favour of reaching a deal and forestalling further tariff increases remains in place,"" said Stephen Olson, research fellow at the Hinrich Foundation.
""The open question is whether [China's] displeasure will be sufficient to scuttle the Phase One trade deal, which by most accounts appeared to be close to conclusion. At a minimum, it will complicate - and likely delay - resolution."""

Of course that claim is preposterous because climate change will bring benefits and relief to places that have long been climatically stressed.
Already the Sahara region has greened up significantly over the past 35 years many studies and satellite images show. It’s be stupid to try to reverse this.

New studies on Ethiopia’s water supply: Harsh droughts more seldom, more precipitation expected in the future
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(German text translated by P Gosselin)
The outlook for Ethiopia looks good. Scientists at Virginia Tech University project that rains will be more frequent in the area of the Blue Nile in Ethiopia as a result of climate change. Here is the press release dated October 10, 2016:
Virginia Tech researchers: Climate change may benefit Ethiopia, increase the country’s access to water
Despite the many disastrous impacts of climate change, there are some regions of the globe that might benefit from hotter temperatures. A team of researchers from Virginia Tech have predicted that water availability in the Blue Nile Basin of Ethiopia may increase in coming decades due to global climate change. It could also lead to increased crop production, spur massive hydroelectric power projects, and foster irrigation development in the region. ‘For all the catastrophic impacts of climate change, there are some silver linings,’ said Zach Easton, associate professor of biological systems engineering. ‘The sad irony is that climate change may be the catalyst Ethiopia needs to become a food-exporting country.’

The research team used a suite of climate and hydrologic models to predict the impact of climate change on water availability and sediment transport in the Blue Nile. Most previous Nile Basin climate impact studies have only focused on water availability, but the study conducted by the team at Virginia Tech was a first of its kind to to assess sediment transport, a big problem in the basin where some of the highest erosion rates in the world have been measured. The findings of the study were recently published in the journal Climatic Change.
‘Ethiopia could experience increased water accessibility making growing seasons longer and potentially allowing for two crops to be grown per year,’ said Moges Wagena, from Assosa, Ethiopia. Wagena is first author on the paper and also associated with the Abay Basin Authority, a water resource management entity for one of Ethiopia’s 12 water basins. Wagena is one of Easton’s doctoral candidates in the Department of Biological Systems Engineering, housed in both the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences and the College of Engineering. The team also included Andrew Sommerlot, another of Easton’s doctoral candidates; Daniel Fuka, a post-doctoral student working with Easton; researchers from the University of Maryland; and the International Water Management Institute, Nile Basin Office. The work was funded by the World Bank and the International Water Management Institute.
The team coupled hydrologic models with bias-corrected and downscaled Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 models, known as CMIP5, for the project. Previously, studies that looked only at temperature and precipitation from the climate models found an increased rate of water availability of just 10 percent, where Easton and Wagena found potentially 20 to 30 percent more streamflow available in the region in the coming decades.
One potential problem that the analysis identified was increased sediment transport in the rivers due to increased water flow. The increased sediment has the potential to reduce the capacity of reservoirs and dams, making massive hydroelectric projects like Ethiopia’s largest dam currently under construction, the Grand Renascence Dam, less efficient in storing the 65 billion cubic meters of water that could potentially turn its turbines. ‘Greater water availability is certainly a positive outcome, but this is countered by more sediment. One way to combat that is through installing conservation practices  on farms, for instance using cover crops and low- and no-till planting methods to make the soil healthier, more stable, and reduce erosion,’ said Easton. While climate change is and will continue to cause untold problems, nuances in climate-induced weather events could benefit the Blue Nile Basin with increased rainfall in the area. ‘It’s interesting, because much of the Blue Nile Basin is well above 5,000 feet in elevation, giving it pretty much an ideal climate for agriculture with low humidity, low disease and pest pressure, and potentially great water availability, which could spur development,’ said Easton.”
The same is true in another study conducted by El Kenawy et al, which appeared in March 2016 in the Cuadernos de Investigación Geográfica. The researchers studied the development of droughts in Ethiopia over the past 50 years and found that the occurrence of severe droughts has declined significantly over the period. The abstract follows:
Changes in the frequency and severity of hydrological droughts over Ethiopia from 1960 to 2013
Here we present an analysis of drought occurrence and variability in Ethiopia, based on the monthly precipitation data from the Climate Research Unit (CRU-v3.22) over the period from 1960 to 2013. The drought events were characterized by means of the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) applied to precipitation data at a temporal scale of 12 months. At the national scale, the results reveal a statistically significant decrease in the severity of droughts over the 54-year period, a pattern that is mostly attributed to a statistically significant decrease in the frequency of high intensity drought episodes (i.e., extreme and very extreme droughts), compared to moderate droughts. To assess the general patterns of drought evolution, a principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to the SPI series. PCA results indicate a high spatial heterogeneity in the SPI variations over the investigated period, with ten different spatially well-defined regions identified. These PCA components accounted for 72.9% of the total variance of drought in the region. These regions also showed considerable differences in the temporal variability of drought, as most of the regions exhibited an increase in wetness conditions in recent decades. In contrast, the regions that receive less than 400 mm of annual precipitation showed a declining  trend, with the largest changes occurring over Afar region. Generally, the highly elevated regions over the central Ethiopian Highlands showed the weakest changes, compared to the lowlands. This study confirms the local character of drought evolution over Ethiopia, providing evidence for policy makers to adopt appropriate local policies to cope with the risks of drought. Over Ethiopia, the detailed spatial assessment of drought evolution is required for a better understanding of the possible impacts of recurrent drought on agriculture, food production, soil degradation, human settlements and migrations, as well as energy production and water resources management across Ethiopia.”

Germany’s national business daily Wirtschaftswoche here reports that the country’s Economic Minister/Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel aims implement a plan that will throttle the expansion of north Germany’s onshore wind parks — due to the fact that rapid building is “overloading the power grid”. 

Photo: wind park in Lower Saxony, Philip May, CC BY-SA 3.0.
This will impact the northern states of Schleswig Holstein, Mecklenburg Western Pomerania and northern Lower Saxony.
Wirtschaftswoche writes that the planned scale-back will profoundly hit the three northern states because they will receive support for only 902 megawatts of power capacity each year– far below the 1300 MW installed just in Schleswig-Holstein in 2014.
This limitation will be a major blow to the German wind industry, which is already reeling from uncertainty in the branch.

The measure is part of this year’s reforms to the German EEG renewable energy feed in act and will be enacted without needing Parliamentary approval, Weltwoche writes. According to the draft measure:



Power grid expansion is not keeping pace with the growth in renewable energies.”
In northern Germany wind parks are often shut down because there still does not exist enough grid power transmission capacity to deliver the power to the industrial markets to the south where demand is big.
The measure is expected to go into effect on March 1, 2017 and stay in effect until the end of 2020 – a period of four years.
The Weltwoche writes that the German greens and renewable energy lobbyists are angered by the upcoming move, claiming that the German government is putting climate protection in doubt and that it should focus on preventing coal and nuclear power from clogging up the power grid.
While Germany expresses bold intentions to make a rapid transition to renewable energies, it is in fact scaling them back.

"**China has sacked the official in charge of relations with Hong Kong, Chinese state media reports.**
Wang Zhimin was director of Beijing's liaison office for the territory.
The Xinhua news agency said Mr Wang had been replaced by Luo Huining, the Communist Party secretary for the northern province of Shanxi.
The sacking follows six months of often violent pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong that have tested Beijing's patience with top officials there.
Carrie Lam, the chief executive of Hong Kong, remains in office with the public support of the mainland leadership, despite being the face of a proposed bill which initially sparked unrest in March 2019.
The bill would have allowed for criminal suspects to be extradited from Hong Kong to mainland China, raising fears that the new law would be abused to detain dissidents and remove them from the territory.
Hong Kong's protesters welcomed the new decade on Wednesday with a New Year's Day rally, which saw tens of thousands of people join a pro-democracy march. The gathering was largely peaceful, save for some small pockets of violence.
Police used water cannon to clear the Mong Kok market district and fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters.
Some 40 parliamentarians and dignitaries from 18 countries sent an open letter to Ms Carrie Lam on New Year's Eve, urging her to ""seek genuine ways forward out of this crisis by addressing the grievances of Hong Kong people"".
Hong Kong was a British colony until 1997, when it was returned to Chinese control under the principle of ""one country, two systems"". While it is technically part of China, the territory has its own legal system and borders, and rights including freedom of assembly and free speech are protected."

The skeptic European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) here brings our attention to a documentary on electric cars by German flagship ARD public television broadcast recently
The news on the electric car situation in Germany does not look good. As it turns out that the government and industry are not really that serious about it, despite all the lofty green rhetoric.
In fact the ARD reports that Daimler has even stopped production of electric cars so that the production line could instead be used to produce regular internal combustion engine cars (ICEs) for deliveries to China and USA. So much for Daimler CEO’s pledge to “become a leader in electric cars.” In fact all German automotive CEOs posture as leaders in electric cars, but the reality is different.
So few cars sold in Germany
ARD wonders why so few electric cars are sold in Germany, despite test drivers finding them quite pleasant to drive – to a certain point. In fact ARD calls Germany e-car sales figures a “a catastrophe”, as only 32,000 electric cars have been registered so far. The target is 1 million by 2020, something that analysts now call “a fairy tale”. The German auto industry puts the blame squarely on the government.
But whose fault is it really for the terrible electric car sales in Germany? ARD decided to look into the topic more deeply and uncovered a number of reasons. They discover that the German automakers have in fact very little interest in pursuing electric cars, nor does the German government.
Low range
Despite claiming that cars can go 190 km on a full charge, ARD shows in fact that the real number for BMW e-cars is only about 120 km. And if the driver sets the car to not exceed the economical 90 km/hr speed and to not to use air conditioning, the range jumps only to 124 km. “A bit depressing,” says the test driver.
Exorbitant cost
Moreover, the BMW i3 test vehicle featured by ARD has a sticker price of a whopping 35,000 euros ($37,000), “about one third more than a comparable petrol engine car,” says the ARD. “Way overpriced,” says the test driver. The question is why is the BMW i3 so expensive even though the ARD reports that the production cost of the lightweight vehicle is relatively low? The answer according to ARD is that the automotive companies want it that way. This explains why BMW sold only a bit over 16,000 cars worldwide last year.
No rush to electric cars
The truth is that the German automakers are putting the brakes on electric cars. There’s a very good reason for that, the ARD discovered. German automakers are in no rush to shift to electric cars because they fear such a move “would only devalue their ICE technology,” says automotive analyst Prof. Stefan Bratzel. “It is irrational for them to shift far into the electric sector.”
eGolf is only an optional variant
Also investigated is an eGolf car by VW. Also here the test driver is impressed by the overall feel of the electric car, but the price is also exorbitant at 35,000 euros — some 15,000 euros more than the comparable petrol version vehicle.
The ARD asks why eGolfs have the exact same look as the conventional Golfs, and so buyers are unable to show and make the statement that they are concerned about protecting the environment. Here the answer lies in the costs surrounding production, and parts sharing among models. The eGolf shares the exact same platform as the other ICE Golf models.
e-cars still remain in question
VW CEO Martin Winterkorn adds: “Currently everything is open when it comes to where the path of the various drives systems.” In summary: the future of e-cars, at least for Winterkorn, still remains in question. The ARD is taken aback by Winterkorn’s comment. For VW, the real money remains in ICE cars and there is little incentive to go electric.

Another sign that electric cars are not being taken seriously by German automakers is the country’s only electric battery plant located near Dresden is slated to be shuttered. The ARD reports that the Evonik plant (owned by Daimler) will be closed by the end of the year (2016), citing that “it is not competitive” despite receiving a 30-million euro subsidy from the government! Today German automotive manufacturers must now rely solely on foreign battery suppliers, such as Samsung, Panasonic, or Tesla for their batteries. ARD in summary reports that Germany is all but out of the race when it comes to electric mobility technology.
Charging stations far too sparse
At the 21:00 mark of the documentary, the ARD switches the focus to more technical problems, namely the lack of charging stations in Berlin and elsewhere. The German television station shows that there are only a small handful in Berlin, making e-cars especially inconvenient and stressful to drive. In Amsterdam, Netherlands, on the other hand, charging stations can be found at almost every street corner, the ARD reports. Out in rural Germany, charging stations are virtually non-existent.
Exaggerated charging times
The ARD reports that the industry even exaggerates the battery charging time, as one test driver shows. Instead of the advertised 30 minutes needed for a “quick charge” in reality it takes 80 minutes. The “quick-charging” network in Germany is also a “catastrophe”, says Kurt Sigl, President of the Federal Association of Mobility.
Subsidies for show
Another peculiarity of the German automotive industry is that German automakers, despite making huge overall profits, are still receiving hundreds of millions in government (taxpayer) subsidies for e-mobility development. Even the charging station in front of BMW headquarters in Munich (27:52 mark) was paid for by a government subsidy to the tune of 900,000 euros!
So far German car producers have received hundreds of million in subsidies from the government, totally unnecessary experts say. There is little to show for it.
Cheating and fudging to meet new CO2 emissions standards
The German automotive industry faces yet another problem: their car fleets will have to meet strict EU CO2 emissions standards by 2020. By then the average car will be allowed to emit only 95 g of CO2 per km. Analysts say German carmakers will have to vastly expand the share of electric cars sold to 20%, an increase of 2000% in 7 years. Failure to meet the standards could mean billions in fines.
German government supports emissions cheating!
But the ARD explains that German automakers plan to cheat their way past the new standards by installing “hybrid” engines and through (legal) fudging during fuel emissions tests. Moreover, leading automobile and truck manufacturers have banned together under the ACEA automotive manufacturers lobby association with the aim of exerting pressure on the regulatory agencies to go easy – and of course with the full support of the German government. The government (unconvincingly) denies this before the ARD camera.
Under the bottom line: The new CO2 standards will be met solely by manipulation and test trickery, and hardly through cleaner engines.
Again the German auto industry and the government, despite all the green talk, are in fact not at all serious about moving away from ICEs and high-end luxury cars, where they are leaders, and over to competing in the ferocious, low-profit e-car sector. One huge juggernaut is that electric cars will be soon be mass-produced in China and sold very cheaply – even from merchandise stores, where they are expected to be snapped up like refrigerators. Electric cars thus threaten to end the huge German car industry, possibly in the matter of a decade.
Titanic clash between the German economic backbone and climatism
It’s clear that Germany ditching the ICE spells the end of a bulk of its mighty ICE auto industry, the very backbone of the country’s — economy which employs directly and indirectly 1 of every 6 German worker. What is coming is the titanic clash between climatism and the fundamental economic interests of the German nation. To save itself, Germany will need to show that efficient ICE’s are not bad for the climate, and that the science of climate change was faulty, and that their cars are in fact far superior to electric carts and do not damage the climate as claimed.
There’s no way that the bulk of the German car industry will be able to compete in the electric sector. Solar technology has shown us that with tens of thousands of German solar jobs getting recently annihilated by cheap Chinese manufacturers.
Unless the climate science nonsense and hysteria get put to rest, Germany risks seeing its energy and automotive sectors collapse.

"Coalmining company Adani asked a Queensland court for orders that would have allowed its representatives to conduct an unannounced search at the family home of an environmental activist. But the supreme court rejected the move, noting the search could result in “humiliation and family distress” for Ben Pennings and others.  Adani said on Wednesday it was suing Pennings, the national spokesperson of the group Galilee Blockade, which has sought to disrupt the operations of Adani, its suppliers and contractors. The former Greens leader Bob Brown released a statement on Thursday, which said the legal action would “send a shudder through every Australian who values democracy, free speech and the right to peaceful protest”. Adani has steadfastly claimed, in repeated public statements, that the campaigns by activists had “failed” to stop progress on the Carmichael project. In the claim filed against Pennings, the company detailed financial loss from activist activities including the withdrawal of former contractors Downer EDI, AECOM and Greyhound Australia. Adani is also seeking damages from Pennings for intimidation and conspiracy, and court costs. After being served with legal documents, Pennings released a statement referring to two ex parte legal applications made by Adani – in the Queensland supreme court and the Queensland court of appeal – prior to its decision to launch the civil case. They show Adani sought a so-called Anton Piller order to conduct a surprise search of Pennings’ home, believing he held confidential Adani information the company sought to obtain before launching the court case. Judgments in the cases reveal Adani hired a private investigator who gave evidence to identify Pennings as the owner of premises in Brisbane, where he lives with his partner and three children. The order sought by Adani was to “permit members of the search party to enter the premises so that they can carry out the search and other activities referred to in this order” and permit them also “to leave and re-enter the premises on the same day and the following day until the search and other activities referred to in this order are complete”. Court documents indicate the proposed search party would comprise two solicitors instructed by Adani Mining and an associated company, Carmichael Rail Network, an independent solicitor and an independent computer expert. Adani sought an order requiring Pennings to permit “the independent computer expert to search any electronic device and make a copy or digital copy of any electronic device and permit the independent computer expert to remove any electronic device from the premises”. “If Mr Pennings were to object, then the independent solicitor would take the electronic devices.” The supreme court and the appeal court rejected the application. The appeal judgment cited commentary by Sir Hugh Laddie, the former high court of England and Wales judge credited with conceiving the idea for an Anton Piller order, which described them as “offensive weapons”. “They have the ability to harm their victims in many ways,” Laddie said in the judgment. “Service of an ex parte order coupled with a demand for immediate entry into premises is likely to produce strong emotional reactions; shock, anger, confusion, a sense of violation and powerlessness are common recollections, even when orders are served by sensitive and tactful solicitors. “The execution of an order may cause severe, sometimes irreparable, physical disruption to a defendant’s business or daily life: the process may take hours to complete.” The court of appeal refused the application citing the nature of the premises as a family home. “Surely, to permit a search of a defendant’s house, with the humiliation and family distress which that might involve, lies at the outer boundary of the discretion,” the judgment states. “This is because, for reasons that anyone can understand, the ‘shock, anger, confusion’ and the ‘sense of violation and powerlessness’ will be much greater in such a case and may be suffered not only by someone who is proved in due course to be a wrongdoer, but by entirely innocent parties as well.” In a statement, Pennings said: “My wife and I have three school-aged children living at home, one with a disability. “Adani has failed in two recent … applications to raid our family home for corporate secrets they believe I possess,” the activist said. “Adani’s ‘attack dog’ legal strategy is well known. They want to silence dissent about their destructive thermal coal project that a majority of Australians oppose. “Adani has already bankrupted traditional owner Adrian Burragubba. I will not let a massive multinational company threaten or bankrupt my family.” Adani said its decision to launch legal action against Pennings was “needed to ensure our business can continue to deliver jobs and opportunities to regional Queensland communities at a time when they were needed most”. “Adani is claiming that Mr Pennings has orchestrated a sustained campaign of harassment and intimidation against Adani’s business, employees, contractors and potential business partners spanning almost a decade.” Alongside its activities conducting physical protests at Adani contractors, Galilee Blockade has run a “dob in Adani” campaign that solicits information from employees of the company and its contractors. “This legal action does not seek to limit free speech. As we have repeatedly stated, we believe a diversity of views is an important part of democracy,” the company said. “Adani is alleging that Mr Pennings has been instrumental in organising blockades and the occupation of offices and industrial premises of many of our existing and potential suppliers, as well as some organisations that have absolutely no association with Adani. “After almost a decade of this type of intimidation, we are saying enough is enough.” In relation to its application for an Anton Piller order, Adani said the application would have enabled a solicitor appointed by the court to secure evidence for the civil case. “The court did not issue the Anton Piller order, however, we are able to pursue the civil claim regardless.”"
"The sheer scale and intensity of the Australian bushfire crisis have led to apocalyptic scenes making the front pages of newspapers the world over. An estimated 10 million hectares (100,000 sq km) of land have burned since 1 July 2019. At least 28 people have died. And over a billion animals are estimated to have been killed to date. Of course, the actual toll will be much higher if major animal groups, such as insects, are included in these estimates. The impacts of climate change – in particular, the consequences of the increasing frequency of extreme weather events on all life should be abundantly clear. People finally seem to be taking this seriously, but there is an undercurrent of opinion about the “naturalness” of wildfires. Some are still questioning the role of climate change in driving the Australian bushfires. It is true that wildfires naturally occur in many parts of the world, and benefit plants and animals in ecosystems that have been uniquely shaped by fire over evolutionary time. And people have been using fire to manage ecosystems for thousands of years. We could learn a thing or two from Aboriginal people and the techniques they have traditionally used to prevent bushfires. But make no mistake, the scientific evidence shows that human-caused climate change is a key driver of the rapid and unprecedented increases in wildfire activity. What is particularly worrying is the extent to which this is eroding the resilience of ecosystems across wide regions. Yes, it is plausible to expect most plants and animals that have adapted to fire will recover. But the ecological costs of huge, repetitive, high-severity wildfires on ecosystems could be colossal. And it’s unclear how much the natural world can tolerate such dramatic disturbance. Wildfires are increasing in severity around the world. The Australian bushfires are larger than some of the deadliest recorded. Incidences are also increasing in ecosystems where wildfires are uncommon, such as the UK uplands. Not to mention the widespread deliberate burning of areas of high conservation value for agriculture, as has been recently reported in large parts of the Brazilian Amazon for beef production and in Indonesia for palm oil.  Unsurprisingly, given the shocking numbers of animals that must have perished as a result of these wildfires, many are questioning whether burned ecosystems can recover from such dramatic losses of biodiversity. In Australia, for example, some estimate that the fires could drive more than 700 insect species to extinction. The world’s biodiversity is already severely struggling – we are in the midst of what scientists describe as the sixth mass extinction. A recent report has highlighted that about a quarter of assessed species are threatened with extinction. Australia already has the highest rate of mammal loss for any region in the world, signalling the fragility of existing ecosystems that might struggle to function in a warming, fire prone world.  Fears for familiar and charismatic animals affected by the bushfires, such as koala, have been expressed by conservationists. The outlook for already critically endangered species, such as the regent honeyeater and western ground parrot, meanwhile, is uncertain. But to establish the true ecological costs of wildfires it is important to consider biodiversity in terms of networks, not particular species or numbers of animals. All species are embedded in complex networks of interactions where they are directly and indirectly dependent on each other. A food web is a good example of such networks. The simultaneous loss of such large numbers of plants and animals could have cascading impacts on the ways species interact – and hence the ability of ecosystems to bounce back and properly function following high-severity wildfires.  And so it’s key that we consider biodiversity loss due to wildfires in terms of entire networks of interacting organisms, including humans, rather than simply one or two charismatic animals. I have studied and recently published research about the loss of plants and animals due to wildfires in Portugal, using new methods in ecology that can examine the resilience of ecosystems to species extinctions. My team found that networks of interacting plants and animals at burned sites became fragile and more prone to species extinctions. Our study looked at the impacts of a large wildfire in 2012 on one of the many ecological interactions that keep ecosystems healthy – insect pollination. We examined the responses of moths, which are important but often overlooked pollinators, to wildfire by comparing those we caught in burned and neighbouring unburned areas.  By collecting, counting and identifying the thousands of pollen grains they were carrying, we were able to decipher the plant-insect network of interacting species. In this way, it was possible to examine not only the responses of the plants and animals to wildfire, but crucially the impacts on pollination processes.  We then used these networks to model the resilience of the ecosystem more generally. We found that burned areas had significantly more abundant flowers (due to a flush of plants whose seeds and roots survived in the soil) but less abundant and species‐rich moths. The total amount of pollen being transported by the moths in burned areas was just 20% of that at unburned areas. Our analysis revealed important differences in the way these species interacted as a result of the wildfire. Although the study was only a snapshot in time, we were able to show that plant-insect communities at burned sites were less able to resist the effects of any further disturbances without suffering species extinctions. And so as people start rebuilding their homes, livelihoods and communities in Australia following the devastating bushfires, it is crucial that governments and land managers around the world take sensible decisions that will build resilience into ecosystems. To do this, ecological interaction networks need to be considered, rather than specific species. Cutting-edge network approaches that examine the complex ways in which entire communities of species interact can and should help with this.  Over 45 years ago, the American evolutionary ecologist and conservationist Dan Janzen wrote: “There is a much more insidious kind of extinction: the extinction of ecological interactions.” We should all be concerned not just about the loss of animals, but about the unravelling of species interactions within ecosystems on which we all depend for our survival.

Over the last eight years, more than two dozen state attorneys general have mustered a veritable legal army to thwart the unconstitutional overreach of the Obama presidency. With the change in administrations, however, these elite forces should not disband, but rather must retool. If the Trump White House is to succeed in restoring constitutional governance, it will need the support, cooperation, and sometimes pressure from the states.



In the short term, state attorneys general can coordinate with the incoming Justice Department to identify the cases and appeals that should be dismissed or settled. Further, these legal officers should roadmap how Congress and the president can rescind unlawful executive actions. Going forward, when progressive states seek to resist federal incursions, conservative states should consider supporting the principles underlying those cases: State capitols, not the central government, should decide local matters. Precedents set during this period will, in the long run, entrench the separation of powers, and ultimately promote individual liberty.



The first order of business for the states on January 20, 2017, will be to discuss with the Justice Department the status of all pending federal–state litigation. These discussions can help to resolve, or settle, a number of current cases and appeals trickling through the judicial system. This practice should not be limited to state‐​led litigation. For example, with less than 15 days left in the Obama presidency, the solicitor general asked the Supreme Court to reverse a rare judicial victory for the Second Amendment. Following a precedent set by the Obama administration in an EPA case from 2009, on further reflection, the new solicitor general can simply withdraw that petition for a writ of certiorari.



 **Rolling Back Regulations**



Over the next six months, congressional Republicans have a unique opportunity to rescind regulations that were published in the waning days of the Obama administration. The Congressional Review Act (CRA), passed in 1996 as part of the Contract with America, allows Congress to disapprove of a regulation that is less than 60 legislative days old. If the president agrees, the regulation is rescinded, and the agency is _permanently_ prohibited from regulating on that issue ever again. It salts the earth in the _Code of Federal Regulations_. The CRA has been used only once — by President George W. Bush in 2001 to rescind an inconsequential regulation concerning ergonomics in the workplace. Now, Republicans have a unique opportunity to kill a bevy of rules that were finalized following May 30, 2016 (counting backwards 60 legislative days from the end of the previous session).



With respect to the CRA, the states can help, big league: by combing through every page of the _Federal Register_ since Memorial Day, attorneys general can identify each and every regulation that warrants recision. Most regulations, though onerous, are perfectly lawful. However, those regulations that violate federal law, or intrude upon the separation of powers, or are flat‐​out unconstitutional, should be jettisoned. There is no need to wait for the courts to act. To provide an even greater help to the overworked staff in Washington, the states should use their sophisticated staff to draft precise disapproval resolutions. Further, the attorneys general should use their leverage to lobby their representatives and senators to get these disapproval resolutions on the congested congressional calendar. The president must sign these disapproval resolutions by the middle of the year, so this unique opportunity has a limited window for success.



For those unlawful regulations that cannot be killed by the CRA — either due to a lack of floor time or a lack of congressional will — there is still hope. Executive‐​branch agencies can initiate new rulemakings, where they announce that upon further reflection, they’ve determined that old regulations are contrary to law, and can no longer stand. To assist this process, state attorney generals should thumb through the _Federal Register_ over the past eight years, flag _all_ arbitrary and capricious regulations, and draft proposed rules to wipe out the Obama‐​era regimes. This support can help relieve the burden from overworked executive‐​branch agencies that will likely find little support from the entrenched bureaucracies. Indeed, civil servants may even oppose and resist the incoming administration’s agenda through slow‐​downs, leaks to the media, or flat‐​out disobedience. Finally, not that he needs it, but the states can give direction to President Trump as he uses his pen and phone (sharpie and twitter?) to systematically unravel President Obama’s unlawful executive actions.





State attorneys general should work together to roll back the federal government’s overreach.



 **Litigating for the Cause of Federalism**



Beyond the regulatory process, Republican attorneys general should continue to use their elite legal teams to litigate for the cause of federalism — even if it incidentally helps progressive states. For example, California has recently boasted that it seeks to become the new Texas — like orange is the new black — and rely on the principles of federalism to resist incursions from the Trump administration into their sanctuary cities. While conservatives may oppose sanctuary cities as a matter of policy, federalists should never lose sight of the fact that the states — and not the central government — should have control over local law‐​enforcement matters. (Consider the controversies over efforts by the Justice Department to monitor police departments.) Indeed, legislators in Austin are currently debating a bill to defund Texas municipalities that refuse to assist with federal immigration enforcement. That is the _right_ way to handle this sort of issue. When California challenges the Trump administration in court, conservative states should not sit by idly. There is a unique opportunity to advance the cause of federalism, and in the process, benefit from any precedents set by fair‐​weathered federalists on the Supreme Court.



First, California will likely assert that it is unconstitutional for the Trump administration to withhold federal funds from sanctuary cities. Once, and only once, has the Supreme Court held that clawing back federal funding violates the principles of federalism. Under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), if a state refused to expand its Medicaid rolls, the federal government threatened to withhold _all_ of its Medicaid funding. For example, the Obama administration warned Arizona that it stood to lose nearly $8 billion of federal funding, which was nearly a quarter of its state budget. The Court observed that across the board, “Medicaid spending accounts for over 20 percent of the average State’s total budget, with federal funds covering 50 to 83 percent of those costs.” In other words, states stood to lose on average 10 percent of their budgets for failing to comply with Obamacare. The ACA’s “financial ‘inducement,’ ” explained Chief Justice Roberts, “is much more than ‘relatively mild encouragement’ — it is a gun to the head.” Because “pressure turned into compulsion,” the Court concluded that the ACA’s Medicaid expansion was unconstitutional.



This precedent, however, does not mean that _every_ effort to withhold money from noncompliant states is unconstitutional. Congress routinely dangles aid to encourage states to comply with federal programs. For example, South Dakota challenged a law that would withhold 5 percent of otherwise available federal highway funds if the state refused to raise its drinking age to 21. In 1987, the Supreme Court upheld this law, finding that “Congress has offered relatively mild encouragement to the States to enact higher minimum drinking ages than they would otherwise choose.” However, the amount at issue was miniscule. In _NFIB v. Sebelius_ , the Court pointed out that “the federal funds at stake,” roughly $4 million, “constituted less than half of one percent of South Dakota’s budget at the time.”



If sanctuary cities seek to halt President Trump’s withdrawal of funding, and the amount falls somewhere between 0.5 percent and 10 percent, the Supreme Court will have to make new precedent. It will not be sufficient to rely solely on _NFIB v. Sebelius_. In that case, Chief Justice Roberts admitted that there was “no need to fix a line” between “persuasion” and “coercion.” Yet, to rule against Trump, Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor (who dissented in _NFIB_ ) will have to go along with a _new_ rule that withholding an amount of money _less than_ that at issue in the Obamacare case is now coercive. Conservative states, rather than waiting on the sidelines, should gladly point out to the Court this necessary departure from _NFIB_. And more specifically, they can flag all of the other federal programs, which threaten to withhold comparably small amounts, are now at risk of invalidation in subsequent litigation. In the long run, a unanimous decision that puts more teeth into the spending‐​clause jurisprudence inures to the benefit of red states. Attorneys general in flyover country should gladly hoist these coastal fair‐​weathered federalists on their own petards.



Second, California may assert that Congress did not provide adequate notice before changing the criteria for receipt of federal funds. The Supreme Court has held that “if Congress intends to impose a condition on the grant of federal moneys, it must do so unambiguously.” The federal government cannot “surpris[e] participating States with postacceptance or ‘retroactive’ conditions.” Like the states opposing Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion, California could assert that it was “surprise[ed]” by the Trump administration’s imposition of “ ‘retroactive’ conditions,” which “transform[ed]” the policy “so dramatically.” Once again, conservative states should support this fight, and urge the Supreme Court to reaffirm the so‐​called clear‐​statement rule. Such a precedent would provide an important precedent for attorneys general to challenge executive‐​branch agencies that suddenly, and unexpectedly, impose massive new conditions on the states, without any adequate notice. By pointing out the implications of ruling for fair‐​weathered federalists, conservative attorneys general can establish another important check on federal power.



To use a contemporary example, the Department of Education recently reinterpreted Title IX, a 40‐​year‐​old law that prohibits sex discrimination in educational institutions, to require all public schools to allow students to use bathrooms based on their gender identity. This term the Supreme Court will consider the validity of this new policy (if it is not first withdrawn by the Trump administration). West Virginia, joined by 20 other states, filed a brief urging the Supreme Court to reject the agency’s rewriting of federal law, which imposed transformative conditions on the states. If the Supreme Court would be willing to strike down the Trump administration’s changes with respect to immigration funding, then the Obama administration’s dramatic changes to Title IX cannot stand.



Third, California may resist any efforts to cooperate with federal immigration officials — and perhaps could even impede their work. For example, several cities already refuse to transfer to the federal government certain criminal aliens who are not lawfully present — ignoring so‐​called detainers — unless a federal court orders the release. Here, progressives are rallying behind Justice Scalia’s opinion in _United States v. Printz_ , which held that Congress cannot commandeer state officials to perform firearm background checks. (Ironically, a gaggle of blue states filed a brief in _Printz_ supporting the constitutionality of the Clinton administration’s conscriptive gun‐​control law.)



But there is another precedent for California to contend with. Arizona’s S.B. 1070, commonly referred to as the “show your papers” law, gave local law enforcement the power to arrest aliens who were in violation of federal immigration law. The Supreme Court invalidated this provision of S.B. 1070, finding that it “stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.” Federal control over immigration, the Court held, is “so pervasive … that Congress left no room for the States to supplement it.” In other words, state immigration policies that interfere with the comprehensive federal immigration scheme are preempted. If Arizona is not allowed to adopt a policy that arguably _helps_ federal law enforcement (by arresting those subject to removal), then California certainly cannot adopt a policy that explicitly _impedes_ federal law enforcement. This precedent does not help sanctuary cities. (For more irony, California filed a brief supporting the Obama administration, and opposing Arizona.)



There is a tension, however, between these two cases. Under _Printz_ , local officials cannot be conscripted to enforce federal law‐​enforcement duties. At the same time, a state law or policy that serves as an “obstacle” to Congress’s federal immigration scheme violates the holding of _Arizona_. Conservative attorneys general should cheerfully point out this tension to the courts. For California to prevail, the Supreme Court will have to shake things up. _Printz_ ’s commandeering doctrine will be expanded, thus reigning in the power of the central government; _Arizona_ ’s preemption analysis will be curtailed, which expands a state’s internal police powers. This rejiggering of precedent would be a boon to federalism.



Fourth, California may attempt to sue the Trump administration’s for its failure to enforce various laws. If that paradigm sounds familiar it should: Texas challenged the legality of the Obama administration’s non‐​enforcement of the immigration laws, known as DAPA. This suit, however, was not unprecedented. In 2005, Massachusetts (joined by California) sued the Environmental Protection Agency for failing to regulate greenhouse gasses. The Supreme Court held that because the Massachusetts coastline could be eroded by the effects of climate change, the state was sufficiently injured to sue in federal court. Citing the basis of _Massachusetts v. EPA_ , the lower courts held that Texas had standing to challenge DAPA. (The Supreme Court ultimately deadlocked on this issue 4–4.)



While California supported President Obama’s illegal executive actions on immigration (filing a brief in support of DAPA), it may not be so keen when the Trump administration decides to exercise its discretion with respect to environmental, financial, and other regulatory prosecutions. If progressive states attempt to challenge executive non‐​enforcement of the law — beyond the context of climate change — conservative states should consider supporting the principle that courts can enforce the president’s duty to faithfully execute the law. They should point out that it is not sufficient to merely reply on _Massachusetts_ , but will need to make new precedent — a precedent that could one day prevent a future a wholesale suspension of the immigration laws.



Fifth, blue states will likely adopt a powerful tool used by red states to reign in federal policy: the nationwide injunction. Over the past three years, federal district judges (mostly in Texas) have single‐​handedly halted President Obama’s unlawful policies concerning immigration, labor law, and financial regulations. Using these injunctions, the judges have bound executive‐​branch officials in all 50 states — even those that welcomed the executive policy. For example, California urged Judge Andrew Hanen in Brownsville that President Obama’s immigration orders should be allowed to go into effect in states that wanted it. No dice, the court held.



Soon enough, these dynamics will flip, as federal judges in San Francisco, Brooklyn, and Chicago, are confronted with requests for nationwide injunctions to halt the Trump administration. As the progressives reverse course, Republican attorney generals should maintain their consistency. More often than not, federal officials will _overreach_ , rather than _underreach_. The nationwide injunction is one of the only remedies available to quickly halt illegal actions before they take effect — and become entrenched. So long as the president takes executive action, especially outside the formal notice‐​and‐​comment process of rulemaking, courts should be able to quickly put a hold on violations of law. This is a policy that attorneys general of all stripes should unwaveringly support.



 **Why Federalism Matters**



I am not Pollyannaish. It is easy enough for a law professor to extoll the value of federalism, but on the ground, elected attorneys general may face a backlash if they actively challenge the Trump administration in court. Three important values should guide this important decision. First, Donald Trump will only be president for the next four to eight years. Sooner, rather than later, a progressive will be in the White House. The precedents that are established now will serve as a check on the havoc a President Elizabeth Warren could unleash on the states. Second, there is a powerful value to gaining buy‐​in from the liberal justices — especially those who will serve for decades to come — for the principles of federalism. True, Justices Kagan or Sotomayor may be able to distinguish California’s present challenges with Texas’s future challenges — but the feebleness of those flip‐​flops will be visible to all.



Finally, and most importantly, state officials take an oath to the Constitution, not to the Republican party. They bear the unique responsibility for enforcing the Tenth Amendment, in all of its dimensions: “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.” The mission of reining in the federal government’s powers, and restoring the Constitution’s separation of powers, should continue for the next four years, eight years, and beyond.

==============================================
Water level of Lake Malawi was 120 meters lower during Little Ice Age
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(German text translated/edited by P Gosselin)
UNICEF is currently collecting donations for Malawi, as reported by the German Passauer Neue Presse (PNP) as a UNICEF director, Johannes Wedenig, reports in an interview:
PNP donation drive: “Climate change bis going to hit Malawi really hard”
WEDENIG: I came to the country in the middle of the crisis in June. To get a first impression, I looked at the food situation and visited some villages. It quickly became clear to me: This crisis is built on earlier crises, on the devastating flood of 2015 and past droughts. With each one, the capacity of the people shrinks and their vulnerability increases.

PNP: Would Malawi be prepared at all for a new flood?
WEDENIG: The government has learned and is logistically better prepared. Also UNICEF is prepared. Our stocks are filled with supplies. But there’s one thing you cannot prepare for: the vulnerability of man is constantly increasing. That’s why the focus is on enhancing their resilience and our structural processes. Climate change is going to hit Malawi hard. It may appear as a contradiction when one looks at the map and sees that half of the country is covered by Lake Malawi. But that does not mean there’s enough water available. The lake is retreating and the forests are being chopped down increasingly. If the water from the rivers and lakes are exploited without sustainable planning, then it will backfire on the people.”
First it is right that there is an emergency in Malawi, and readers here are encouraged to donate.
However, linking the situation in Malawi to climate change and indirectly blaming donators in Germany is ethically questionable. Lakes and rivers in Malawi have always undergone natural variation (for example read here).
A team of scientists led by Thomas Johnson researched and reconstructed the lake level history over the past 700 years and found something astonishing: Between 1570 and 1850 the lake level was in fact 120 m lower than it is today, and during the 14th and 15th centuries. Read the paper’s abstract in 2001 in Geology:
Decadal record of climate variability spanning the past 700 yr in the Southern Tropics of East Africa
Biogenic silica profiles in varved sediments from northern Lake Malawi (Nyasa), East Africa, span the past 700 yr and reflect past primary productivity in the overlying waters. On a centennial scale this has been influenced by lake level and a consequent shift in the location of high diatom productivity within the lake basin. Primary production was higher during the Little Ice Age, an arid period from about A.D. 1570 to 1850, when lake level was about 120 m lower than during the previous three centuries or the past 150 yr.”
So what could be behind the natural rainfall dynamic, which is unknown to UNICEF? What follows is some recommended reading:

Share this...FacebookTwitterYesterday veteran meteorologist Joe Bastardi brought to our attention an article by the Washington Post here, where it reports forecasters are warning that the coming winter “could get nasty” for the Washington D.C. area.
Although the National Weather Service predicts “equal chances of a cold or mild winter”, private meteorologists warn the winter could get bitter. There’s a real debate going on.
The Post cites meteorologist Judah Cohen, who uses the Arctic Oscillation as a predictor of winters, writing that greater-than-normal October Eurasian snow cover tends to lead to large blocking highs that steer cold air southwards into the middle latitude regions.
Early winter for Europe?
After a summerlike warm September in Central Europe, things have cooled down significantly, with Central European temperatures running below normal so far this October. German climate skeptic site wobleibtdieerderwaermung.de here writes that there are now signs of an early winter hitting Central Europe, with freezing temperatures and snow forecast for early November.
Current models show a major storm positioned over northeast Europe, which would send a large mass of cold air with temperatures at -35°C at the 5500m level (500 hPa) over large parts of Europe:

Today’s GFS model runs (below) also continue to show cold setting in early November:

This forecast is 10 – 15 days out, and so naturally there is a fair amount of uncertainty involved. But it tells Europeans that maybe it’s a good idea not to delay putting the winter tires on. Snow is hardly a thing of the past.
The cold temperatures would lead to precipitation likely falling as snow, even in the lowland regions:

12 billion tonnes of ice in a single day!
One thing is certain: Greenland just got bombed by a “record” snowfall (hat-tip: wobleibtdieglobaleerwaermung), thanks to what used to be hurricane Nicole. some 12 billion tonnes of “record ice growth in a single day” – see chart:

Top: The total daily contribution to the surface mass balance from the entire ice sheet (blue line, Gt/day). Bottom: The accumulated surface mass balance from September 1st to now (blue line, Gt) and the season 2011-12 (red) which had very high summer melt in Greenland. For comparison, the mean curve from the period 1990-2013 is shown (dark grey). The same calendar day in each of the 24 years (in the period 1990-2013) will have its own value.

"The effect that fossil fuels are having on the climate emergency is driving an international push to use low-carbon sources of energy. At the moment, the best options for producing low-carbon energy on a large scale are wind and solar power. But despite improvements over the last few years to both their performance and cost, a significant problem remains: the wind doesn’t always blow, and the sun doesn’t always shine. A power grid that relies on these fluctuating sources struggles to constantly match supply and demand, and so renewable energy sometimes goes to waste because it’s not produced when needed. One of the main solutions to this problem is large-scale electricity storage technologies. These work by accumulating electricity when supply exceeds demand, then releasing it when the opposite happens. However, one issue with this method is that it involves enormous quantities of electricity.  Existing storage technologies like batteries wouldn’t be good for this kind of process, due to their high cost per unit energy. Currently, over 99% of large-scale electricity storage is handled by pumped hydro dams, which move water between two reservoirs through a pump or turbine to store or produce power. However, there are limits to how much more pumped hydro can be built due to its geographical requirements. One promising storage option is pumped thermal electricity storage. This relatively new technology has been around for about ten years, and is currently being tested in pilot plants. Pumped thermal electricity storage works by turning electricity into heat using a large-scale heat pump. This heat is then stored in a hot material, such as water or gravel, inside an insulated tank. When needed, the heat is then turned back into electricity using a heat engine. These energy conversions are done with thermodynamic cycles, the same physical principles used to run refrigerators, car engines or thermal power plants.  Pumped thermal electricity storage has many advantages. The conversion processes mostly rely on conventional technology and components (such as heat exchangers, compressors, turbines, and electrical generators) that are already widely used in the power and processing industries. This will shorten the time required to design and build pumped thermal electricity storage, even on a large scale.  The storage tanks can be filled with abundant and inexpensive materials such as gravel, molten salts or water. And, unlike batteries, these materials pose no threat to the environment. Large molten salt tanks have been successfully used for many years in concentrated solar power plants, which is a renewable energy technology that has seen rapid growth during the last decade. Concentrated solar power and pumped thermal electricity storage share many similarities, but while concentrated solar power plants produce energy by storing sunlight as heat (and then converting it to electricity), pumped thermal electricity storage plants store electricity that may come from any source – solar, wind or even nuclear energy, among others. Pumped thermal electricity storage plants can be installed anywhere, regardless of geography. They can also easily be scaled up to meet the grid’s storage needs. Other forms of bulk energy storage are limited by where they can be installed. For example, pumped hydro storage requires mountains and valleys where substantial water reservoirs can be built. Compressed air energy storage relies on large subterranean caverns. Pumped thermal electricity storage has a higher energy density than pumped hydro dams (it can store more energy in a given volume). For example, ten times more electricity can be recovered from 1kg of water stored at 100°C, compared to 1kg of water stored at a height of 500 metres in a pumped hydro plant. This means that less space is required for a given amount of energy stored, so the environmental footprint of the plant is smaller. The components of pumped thermal electricity storage typically last for decades. Batteries, on the other hand, degrade over time and need to be replaced every few years – most electric car batteries are typically only guaranteed for about five to eight years.  However, even though there are many things that make pumped thermal electricity storage well-suited for large-scale storage of renewable energy, it does have its downsides. Possibly the biggest disadvantage is its relatively modest efficiency – meaning how much electricity is returned during discharge, compared to how much was put in during charge. Most pumped thermal electricity storage systems aim for 50-70% efficiency, compared to 80-90% for lithium-ion batteries or 70-85% for pumped hydro storage. But what arguably matters most is cost: the lower it is, the faster society can move towards a low carbon future. Pumped thermal electricity storage is expected to be competitive with other storage technologies – though this won’t be known for certain until the technology matures and is fully commercialised. As it stands, several organisations already have working, real-world prototypes. The sooner we test and start deploying pumped thermal electricity storage, the sooner we can use it to help transition to a low-carbon energy system."

 **The Urban Development Bill**



‘Objective of Bill is to better co-ordinate use of land, infrastructure, and public assets to maximise public benefit from complex urban development projects’



In the past private property in New Zealand has only been seized for essential public works such as roading. The Urban Development Bill gives the housing authority Kainga Ora **sweeping powers to force the acquisition of private property** on behalf of developers.



‘Kainga Ora will have land acquisition and transfer powers when undertaking any urban development […] The Bill has safeguards in place to ensure that the use of land acquisition powers strikes an appropriate balance between the need to meet urban development outcomes and the need to maintain certainty of property rights.’



Under this legislation, anyone with a **home and garden** is vulnerable and insecure. In America, authorities can come to arrangements with developers, whereby property owners are forced to sell out and make way for private economic development when officials decide it would benefit the public, even if the property is not blighted and the new project’s success is not guaranteed. This will certainly happen in New Zealand if government measures to **undermine land rights** are permitted to proceed. See [Kelo v. City of New London Ten Years Later](https://www.nationalreview.com/2015/06/kelo-eminent-domain-richard-epstein/)



 **‘Climate Change’ and The Threat to Coastal Development Property Rights**



‘Draconian policy […] is destroying coastal communities on the back of projections which are basically lies.‘ 



The most reliable sea rise gauges world-wide indicate an average global rise of 1-2mm per annum, and not accelerating. See, for example, [Wismar, Germany data](https://sunshinehours.net/2016/04/24/150-years-of-sea-level-rise-in-germany/), that shows a long-term trend of 1.4mm with no acceleration; an analysis of [the 225 tide stations more than 50 years old](http://www.sealevel.info/avgslr.html), which gave an average of 1.4mm pa; an analysis of the [212 tide gauges with 60 years of recorded data](http://www.aiscience.org/journal/paperInfo/aj3g?paperId=2782) in 2014, of which the most common SLR was +1.25 mm/year in 37 tide gauges. Members of the School of Surveying, Otago University, and GNS NZ found [**an average annual sea level rise of 0.9 mm over four main NZ centres**](https://fig.net/resources/proceedings/fig_proceedings/fig2017/papers/ts01c/TS01C_denys_beavan_et_al_8728.pdf) **,** once subsidence is taken into account



 **Coastal property is now under threat** of rezoning purely on the basis of extravagant claims of global sea-rise. Dr David Kear, former Director-General of New Zealand’s Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, noted that the Ohope Council declared a landwards inundation at Ohope Beach, [contrary to local advice and the conclusions of their own consultants](https://stovouno.org/2019/01/26/top-nz-scientist-describes-global-warming-as-pseudo-science/). Kear concluded that councils seem to feel that (unknown) higher authorities insist that they must ignore evidence that supports accretion.



Despite all the factual evidence to the contrary, Wellington local authorities, as well as the corporate media, are projecting sea rise of several metres within a short time: according to one report, the Lower Hutt suburb of Petone [could be swallowed up by sea rise in just 80 years](https://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/climate-news/108862230/lower-hutt-suburb-could-be-swallowed-up-by-sea-level-rise-in-just-80-years.).



In the United Kingdom, over 50 villages on the Welsh coast are facing their demise, not because of rising seas, but because of rezoning on the basis of alarmist claims. Not untypical is [‘Some of Wales’ major coastal towns and cities could be underwater in the next 100 years, experts warn’](https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/wales-major-coastal-towns-cities-10496070); apparently sea rise ‘could be at least 6 metres’. ‘Experts’ are a consortium of climate scientists and journalists called Climate Central, funded according to [Sourcewatch](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Climate_Central) by a number of impressive bodies such as Google, the David and Lucille Packard Foundation, NASA, the Turner Foundation and certainly by the [Rockefeller Foundation](https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/our-work/grants/climate-central/), [founder of the global warming mov](https://stovouno.org/2019/02/23/globalism-of-climate-how-faux-environmental-concern-hides-desire-to-rule-the-world/)[e](https://stovouno.org/2019/02/23/globalism-of-climate-how-faux-environmental-concern-hides-desire-to-rule-the-world/)[ment](https://stovouno.org/2019/02/23/globalism-of-climate-how-faux-environmental-concern-hides-desire-to-rule-the-world/). World-renowned sea level authority such as [Nils Axel-Mörner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28AJAfjuUX4) has declared the claims to be completely unfounded, and some Welsh villages are[ suing the UK government](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/environment/climatechange/12152240/Welsh-village-to-sue-government-over-alarmist-rising-sea-level-claim.html) over their alarmism.



 **Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration**



The NZ Government is signatory to the UN’s Global Compact on Migration, designed in fact to facilitate migration. The reasons for supporting or opposing the mass movement of people are complex. It should be pointed out, however, that aside from the pressure on housing that is created by a large number of arrivals from overseas, their presence is likely to favour urbanisation and undermine the tradition of home ownership.



 **Maori Aspirations:**



‘Many iwi, hapu and whanau have significant aspirations to play a greater role in managing biodiversity on public and private land’. ‘[by 2020] Mana whenua feel that they can genuinely practice their role as kaitiaki [guardianship]’. 



In all the proposed legislation – the Statement on Indigenous Biodiversity, the Biodiversity Strategy, Urban Development Bill – the demand for an increasing role for iwi is reiterated time and again, but not explained. It is unclear what the role of kaitiaki entails, whether the proposals flag Maori having a greater say over (non-Maori) private land usage, or its compulsory acquisition, or they are paving the way for the Treaty of Waitangi being amended to cover private land, as has been mooted recently.



 **The Role of the United Nations**



The main focus of Agenda 21 is to take control of the land because once they do that, they can control any human activity 



The inspiration for the **assault on private property** comes not from a movement within New Zealand but from policies developed by the United Nations bureaucracy. At present, the only legal authority for SNAs and the new policies regarding claiming private land for ‘biodiversity’ is the UN’s Convention on Biological Diversity 1992.



 **The Convention on Biological Diversity**



Signatory countries, regardless of their different circumstances, agree _‘as far as possible’_ to:



(a) Establish a system of protected areas or areas where special measures need to be taken to conserve biological diversity;



[…] **(e) Promote environmentally sound and sustainable development in areas adjacent to protected areas with a view to furthering protection of these areas;** (f) Rehabilitate and restore degraded ecosystems and promote the recovery of threatened species;



The Convention thus commits signatory countries to open-ended reversion of private land to its ‘original’ state.



As Michael Coffman ([Agenda 21 Wildlands Project](http://rangefire.us/2019/03/09/agenda-21-wildlands-project-what-you-need-to-know/)) points out, state control over private property has been central to every international treaty since the 1970s _._ One of the most explicit UN position statements on private land is contained in the [Official Report](https://undocs.org/A/CONF.70/15) of the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements 1976, also known as Habitat 1:



Land, because of its unique nature and the crucial role it plays in human settlements, cannot be treated as an ordinary asset, controlled by individuals and subject to the pressures and inefficiencies of the market. Private land ownership is also a principal instrument of accumulation and concentration of wealth and therefore contributes to social injustice; if unchecked, it may become a major obstacle in the planning and implementation of development schemes. Social justice, urban renewal and development, the provision of decent dwellings and healthy conditions for the people can only be achieved if land is used in the interests of society as a whole.



Public control of land use is therefore indispensable to its protection as an asset and the achievement of the long-term objectives of human settlement policies and strategies.



 **Agenda 21**



[ **Agenda 21**](https://governamerica.com/issues/global-issues/un/agenda-21/agenda-21-full-text) is a non-binding action plan which was presented for signature, along with the Convention on Biological Diversity, at the Rio Earth Summit 1992. The document _Agenda 21_ serves as the text for the UN’s Agenda 2030 and its [‘Sustainable Development Goals’](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/dsd/agenda21/index.shtml). Agenda 21 proposes the expansion of government control over all areas of life, on the basis of the two prongs of environmentalism promoted by the elite foundations, ie ‘biodiversity’ and ‘climate’. Agenda 21 is closely linked to the elite globalist movement, is sponsored by the mega-corporations, and has been referred to variously as [Marxist](https://archive.org/details/Agenda21Neo-environmentalismAndSustainability--AllMarxism-As), [fascist,](https://wakeup-world.com/2014/08/05/agenda-21-the-plan-for-a-global-fascist-dictatorship/) [totalitarian](https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-07-17/united-nations-agendas-totalitarian-map) and [Orwellian](https://www.biyn995christian.kiwi.nz/un-agenda-21-2030).



A number of local authority networking platforms have been founded and funded by Rockefeller and other elite foundations specifically for the purpose of promoting Agenda 21, including [ICLEI](https://cbc.iclei.org/) and [100 Resilient Cities](https://www.100resilientcities.org/), the latter founded by David Rockefeller himself. Because of the threat they present to private landowners, [more than half of American states](https://www.citylab.com/equity/2014/05/geography-anti-agenda-21-movement/9056/) have introduced legislation to the implementation of policies or recommendations emanating from Agenda 21, ICLEI, or even the [United Nations](https://legiscan.com/ME/bill/LD161/2015?fbclid=IwAR1aitw3JZ-3qCtkMTi5aYnccwXrZphXOKTcjvqk6ZO8AtoGYcUhfUx78-8), with varying results.



See also: [Agenda 21 and How it Plays Out](https://stovouno.org/2020/02/19/agenda-21-and-how-it-plays-out/), and Ryan Cristian, [Agenda 2030 (aka New World Order) Decrypted](https://humansarefree.com/2016/04/agenda-2030-aka-new-world-order-decrypted.html), which includes an analysis of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals.



 **The Way Forward**



The establishment of SNAs shows that decisions are already being implemented which are not based on New Zealand legislation and New Zealand values but are guided by undeclared forces. Government measures now seek to legitimise public control or purchase of private property, which will mean that nobody can feel secure in their own home.



It is clear that the only way to protect traditional private property rights is to pass specific legislation to that end, including amending (or repealing) the RMA.



Consideration should also be given to banning local authority networking platforms such as ICLEI, whose raison d’etre is the promotion of Agenda 21 and the undermining of what New Zealand sees as essential values.



At the very least, there should be a proper debate in New Zealand over whether we accept policies that place all non-human nature above humanity, and whether we accept the scenario that native fauna should enjoy unlimited space and unlimited rights while those of human beings must be severely curtailed.

Share this...FacebookTwitterRemember how over much of the past few decades there was a broad consensus among doctors and the entire medical profession that foods high in saturated fats, like butter, chicken and eggs, boosted cholesterol and thus increased the risk of dangerous heart disease. Instead, the doctors told us, we should focus on a low-fat, high-carb diet. Avoid eggs, they advised us.
The result: tens of millions of heart attacks, premature deaths, and tens of millions of people with Type II diabetes. It is turning out to be one of the greatest scientific blunders (if not flat out frauds) of human history.
Fortunately doctors are finally beginning to back off from the egg-avoidance insanity.

Image: www.eggs.ca/nutrition/
The latest anecdote showing that the low-fat, high-carb diet is bogus comes with the news of Emma Morano, who today turned 117 today. She is thought to be the oldest person on the planet. A key to her long life, the BBC reports here, has been her daily intake of three eggs per day.
Ms Morano’s longevity, she admits, is partly down to genetics – her mother reached 91 and several sisters reached their centenary – and partly, she says, down to a rather unusual diet of three eggs – two raw – each day for more than 90 years.”
100,000 eggs consumed over lifetime
Three eggs a day over 90 years comes out to be 98,550 eggs. Add another couple thousand eggs for the earlier years and you easily get over 100,000 eggs consumed during her long life.

That’s a lot of cholesterol! And cholesterol that the quack doctors and their consensus said was killing millions of us and that we should consume sparingly. Obviously Ms. Morano’s health paid no attention to the consensus medical science, and did splendidly.
“Negligent” vegans
And then there are vegans, fanatics who vehemently claim we should not eat any animal-based foods at all and so make the consumption of nutritious eggs taboo. Fortunately not only Emma Morano has had the good sense to ignore “consensus” medical advice, but also some Italian politicians are getting serious about it, too. For example, according to treehugger.com here, Italian MP Elvira Savino is proposing jailing parents who force their children to follow a vegan diet. Savino believes that parents “should be prosecuted for imposing such ‘reckless and dangerous eating behavior’ on children 16 and under.”
Why? Treehugger reported:
Savino proposed the new law after learning about several recent and disturbing incidents involving negligent parents and inadequate nutrition for young children. In one case, a one-year-old boy in Milan, raised on a strict vegan diet and weighing only 5 kg (11 pounds) when taken from his parents, had to undergo emergency heart surgery; his calcium levels were at the lowest necessary to survive. Another toddler from Genoa spent days in pediatric care in a hospital due to vitamin deficiencies as a result of a vegan diet. Last year, a mother was ordered by an Italian court to cook meat for her 12-year-old son after his father complained that a vegan diet was stunting his growth.”
Many of us believe in Darwinism, but please do leave the kids out of it! If you wish to make your self ill thinking it’ll make you healthy and at the same time save the planet, be my guest. But don’t go imposing your dangerous nonsense on others.
Personally I changed my diet a couple of years ago and eggs have since become a major part of my nutrition. I now eat roughly 10-15 eggs per week. My blood values and overall health have improved immensely.
And now I might even boost that number, given the result we see from Senora Morano.

From the University of Washington
Unusually warm oceans can have widespread effects on marine ecosystems. Warm patches off the Pacific Northwest from 2013 to 2015, and a couple of years earlier in the Atlantic Ocean, affected everything from sea lions to fish migration routes to coastal weather.
A University of Washington oceanographer is lead author of a study looking at the history of such features across the Northern Hemisphere. The study was published in March in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
“We can think of marine heatwaves as the analog to atmospheric heatwaves, except they happen at the sea surface and affect marine ecosystems,” said lead author Hillary Scannell, a UW doctoral student in oceanography. “There are a lot of similarities.”
Land-based heatwaves are becoming more frequent and more intense due to climate change. Scannell and her collaborators’ work suggests this may also be happening in the north Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Their study finds that marine heatwaves have recurred regularly in the past but have become more common since the 1970s, as global warming has become more pronounced.
The new paper looks at the frequency of marine heatwaves in the North Atlantic and the North Pacific since 1950. Scannell did the work as a master’s student at the University of Maine, where she was inspired by the 2012 record-breaking warm waters off New England.
“After that big warming event of 2012 we keyed into it and wanted to know how unusual it was,” Scannell said. The study also analyzes another recent event, the so-called “warm blob” that emerged in 2013 and 2014 off the Pacific Northwest.
The authors analyzed 65 years of ocean surface temperature observations, from 1950 to 2014, and also looked at how these two recent events stack up.
In general, the results show that the larger, more intense and longer-lasting a marine heatwave is, the less frequently it will occur. The study also shows that the two recent events were similar to others seen in the historical record, but got pushed into new territory by the overall warming of the surface oceans.
An event like the northwest Atlantic Ocean marine heatwave, in which an area about the size of the U.S. stayed 2.0 degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 C) above normal for three months, is likely to naturally occur about every five years in the North Atlantic and northwestern Pacific oceans, and more frequently in the northeast Pacific.
The “blob” in the northeast Pacific covered an even larger area, with surface temperatures 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 C) above normal for 17 months, and is expected from the record to naturally happen about once every five years off the West Coast.
In the northeast Pacific, the record shows that marine heatwaves are more likely during an El Niño year and when the Pacific Decadal Oscillation brings warmer temperatures off the west coast of North America. So the 2013-15 “blob” likely got an extra kick from a possible transition to the favorable phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, as well as from the overall warming of the ocean.
“The blob was an unfortunate but excellent example of these events,” Scannell said. “As we go into the uncharted waters of a warming climate, we may expect a greater frequency of these marine heatwaves.”
Scannell is also co-author of an earlier study published in February in which the authors define the term “marine heatwave” and specify the duration, temperature change and spatial extent that would meet their criteria. That study was led by researchers in Australia, who were curious about a warm event from 2010 to 2011 in the Indian Ocean.
“We’re working towards a more streamlined definition so we can more easily compare these events when they occur in the future,” Scannell said.
Better understanding of marine heatwaves could help prepare ocean ecosystems and maritime industries. At the UW, Scannell currently works with Michael McPhaden, a UW affiliate professor of oceanography and scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration looking at air-sea interactions along the equator and other factors that might create marine heatwaves.

Co-authors on the new paper are Andrew Pershing and Katherine Mills at the Gulf of Maine Research Institute, Michael Alexander at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Andrew Thomas at the University of Maine. The study was funded by the National Science Foundation.
Frequency of marine heatwaves in the North Atlantic and North Pacific since 1950
Abstract
Extreme and large-scale warming events in the ocean have been dubbed marine heatwaves, and these have been documented in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. This paper examines the intensity, duration, and frequency of positive sea surface temperature anomalies in the North Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans over the period 1950–2014 using an objective definition for marine heatwaves based on their probability of occurrence. Small-area anomalies occur more frequently than large-area anomalies, and this relationship can be characterized by a power law distribution. The relative frequency of large- versus small-area anomalies, represented by the power law slope parameter, is modulated by basin-scale modes of natural climate variability and anthropogenic warming. Findings suggest that the probability of marine heatwaves is a trade-off between size, intensity, and duration and that region specific variability modulates the frequency of these events.

[ **Dr Muriel Newman**](https://www.nzcpr.com/author/mn/)  
[nzcpr.com](https://www.nzcpr.com/covid-19/#more-31482)



On December 31 last year, the Municipal Health Committee in the city of Wuhan – the capital of the Hubei province in central China – [announced](http://wjw.wuhan.gov.cn/front/web/showDetail/2019123108989) a small outbreak of an unknown type of viral pneumonia. It had affected 27 people associated with South China Seafood City, a live-animal market.



Symptoms included a sore throat, fever, and breathing difficulties. Chest x-rays showed the presence of lesions on the lungs. Seven of the patients were reported to be in a serious condition but the remainder were stable.



The patients had been isolated for treatment, and investigations were underway to discover the cause of the infection. No obvious human-to-human transmission was reported. 



China, which had been at the centre of two new viral pneumonia outbreaks in the past – bird flu (H5N1) and SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) – had been heavily criticised for withholding information for too long. So, when this new outbreak occurred, the World Health Organisation (WHO) was notified



By January 5, the number of patients had increased to 59. Seven were critical. Preliminary investigations had ruled out influenza, bird flu, SARS and MERS (Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome). While there was still no evidence of human-to-human transmission, 163 close contacts were being followed up for observation.



Two days later it was announced that the virus had been isolated and the genome sequence obtained. It was a new (novel) type of coronavirus (CoV), a family of viruses – named for their crown-like spikes – that can infect both animals and people, causing a range of respiratory illnesses from the common cold to more dangerous conditions like SARS and MERS.



Because the new virus could cause severe acute respiratory syndrome it was named SARS-CoV-2. The disease associated with it is now referred to as COVID-19.



Seven coronaviruses are now known to infect humans: the alpha, beta, gamma, and delta strains, SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. While the first four are responsible for influenza-type illnesses, with a fatality rate of 0.1 percent, both SARS and MERS are more deadly.



Since the pneumonia produced by these viruses is not a bacterial infection, antibiotics are ineffective. However, if bacterial infections are also triggered by the disease, then those can be treated with antibiotics.



With no effective antiviral drugs for COVID-19 available, recovery depends on the strength of a person’s immune system.



Initial assessments show that while the effects of the disease can be minor, with some infected people not even aware that they have it, for older people and those in poor health – particularly with pre-existing medical conditions such as asthma, diabetes, and heart disease – the impact can be severe.



According to [research](https://www.livescience.com/new-china-coronavirus-faq.html) carried out by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention in mid-February, among those aged 80 and older the death rate was 14.8 percent, compared to 8 percent for those in their seventies, 3.6 percent for those in their sixties, 1.3 percent for those in their fifties, 0.4 percent for those in their forties, and 0.2 percent for those aged 10 to 39. No deaths had been reported among children from birth to age 9.



While the overall death rate in China was 2.3 percent, in the Hubei Province, where the outbreak began, the death rate was 2.9 percent, compared with just 0.4 percent in other provinces — a 7-fold difference.



The spread of the disease has been rapid. According to [data](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/) provided by the WHO – which is coordinating the global response – at the time of writing, not even 12 weeks after the first case presented itself on December 12, some 87,137 people have been infected in 58 countries, with 2,977 recorded deaths.



This week’s NZCPR Guest Commentator, Dr Matt Ridley, a science journalist and Member of Britain’s House of Lords, explains that the natural host of the new coronavirus is a bat. He describes how COVID-19 is thought to have spread to humans through a pangolin – an endangered anteater sold at the Wuhan market that had probably been infected by a bat:



“This is not the first disease bats have given us. Rabies possibly originated in bats. So did Ebola, outbreaks of which usually trace back to people coming into contact with bat roosts in caves, trees or buildings… SARS, which originated in China in 2003, is derived from bats, though possibly via civet cats. So is MERS, a similar bat-borne coronavirus that’s killed hundreds of people and camels in the Middle East since 2012.



“Why are bats responsible for so many recent zoonoses (posh Greek for infections acquired from other animal species)? First, bats are mammals, which means they are sufficiently closely related to us for some of their viruses to thrive in our bodies. A virus that lives in a fish or a bird is less likely to be able to infect a human being, influenza being a rare exception, caught from ducks via pigs.



“Second, bats have never been domesticated. On the whole, we have already caught the diseases of cows and pigs and dogs. Measles, smallpox, anthrax and tuberculosis were all gifts from our farmed animals.



“Third, unlike most other mammals, bats live in huge flocks — just as we do. They therefore host viruses that spread by casual contact.



“But why now? That is easy to answer too. It’s not because of climate change or the destruction of forests. Bats have lived in belfries, as well as dead trees, for centuries. It’s because we now live at such high densities and travel so much… we are a tempting target. The chances are that plenty of people died of bat-borne infections in the past too, but the epidemic usually petered out because villages were small and long-distance travel was rare.”



Coronaviruses are believed to have evolved from animals to humans to maximise their spread. Most make people sick but will not kill them. This is in contrast to SARS, which has a fatality rate of almost 10 percent and infected more than 8,000 people before being brought under control, and MERS, which has a fatality rate of almost 35 percent but is not so contagious infecting only 2,500 people.



It’s the fact that COVID-19 infects the upper respiratory tract that makes it so easily spread. That’s why health agencies are focussed on containment.



Essentially the [advice](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) for keeping yourself safe is common sense.



Because the virus spreads by direct contact, it’s important to maintain a social distance of at least a metre from anyone coughing or sneezing to protect yourself from the small droplets they spray that may contain the virus. Since infected droplets can land on surfaces that may infect your hands, it’s important to avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth to prevent the virus entering your body and making you sick.



That’s why the main recommendation is to wash your hands regularly and thoroughly with soap and water, or use an alcohol-based hand rub, to kill any viruses that may be on your skin.



Anyone who has a cold is advised to cover their mouth and nose with a bent elbow or a tissue when coughing or sneezing. If they develop a fever or breathing difficulties, they are advised to stay at home and call their doctor or the Ministry of Health Help Line on 0800-358-5453.



While anyone who is sick should consider wearing a facemask to help prevent the spread of their infection, the advice for healthy people is that they only need to wear a mask if they are taking care of a person with a suspected infection.



Those who are vulnerable, such as the elderly or anyone with existing respiratory or immune problems, are advised to protect themselves as much as they can by getting the latest flu vaccine as soon as it becomes available.



For most people who become infected, the illness will be mild, and they will recover. The incubation period has been found to be between two and 10 days before symptoms start to appear, with an average of five days. That’s why anyone concerned they might have caught the disease is advised to self-isolate for 14 days. If flu-like symptoms start to appear – a fever greater than 38°C along with a shortness of breath, cough or sore throat – they should call the Help Line.



According to the WHO website, lots of false claims are being made about preventing and treating COVID-19, so it’s worthwhile outlining some sensible advice for anyone experiencing flu-like symptoms. 



Firstly, stay home and get plenty of rest, so your body can better battle the infection. If it is more serious, a fever may occur as your body turns up the heat to fight the virus. Drink plenty of fluids to keep your respiratory system hydrated. That way, any mucus that forms will be thin enough to be coughed up – reducing the chances of it infecting the lungs. Sitting in a steamy bathroom or running a humidifier can ease congestion and coughs. Expectorants to help break up mucus and saltwater nasal sprays are effective too.



The global community has responded to this virus threat with unprecedented speed. Clinical trials have already commenced to test existing antiviral drugs, and work on developing a vaccine is now well underway.



Making vaccines is said to be as much an art as a science. It involves finding a viral sequence that will reliably trigger a protective immune-system response, but not acute symptoms. This requires testing in labs and eventually in people. While it took 20 months from obtaining the gene sequence of the SARS virus to clinical trials of a vaccine, scientists are hoping to do the same for COVID-19 in just weeks.



The outbreak has been declared by the WHO as a public health emergency of international concern. While the infection rate is high, fortunately, the fatality rate appears to be relatively low.



In comparison, the H5N1 bird flu kills over 50 percent of those it infects. While it spreads rapidly in birds, so far it doesn’t in humans as there are only 455 [recorded](https://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/2020_01_20_tableH5N1.pdf?ua=1) deaths.



But the WHO has warned, “If the H5N1 virus were to change and become easily transmissible from person to person while retaining its capacity to cause severe disease, the consequences for public health could be very serious.”



Last month, China’s Ministry of Agriculture [reported](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3048566/china-reports-outbreak-deadly-bird-flu-among-chickens-hunan) there had been an outbreak of H5N1 in the Hunan province, which borders Hubei where COVID-19 originated. Over half of a farm’s 8,000 chickens had died from the disease. Authorities had culled 20,000 poultry to try to contain the outbreak.



While there were no reports of human contagion, it’s important to remember that viruses are constantly changing, and major concerns remain about the potential for the deadly H5N1 to adapt. With annual deaths from the ordinary flu [estimated](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2017/p1213-flu-death-estimate.html) to be as high as 646,000 globally, it’s not hard to imagine the devastation such a virus mutation could cause.



Since the cost of developing a new vaccine is said to be in the vicinity of $1 billion, maybe it’s time for a greater global effort to protect humans from the threat of deadly viruses. Perhaps some of the [estimated](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02712-3) $1 trillion-plus that is currently being spent globally on trying to prevent natural climate change could be redirected to a cause that could potentially save humanity from a real threat.



With many people infected by COVID-19 showing no symptoms at all, and new [reports](http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/02/three-states-report-new-community-spread-covid-19) emerging that community transmission is occurring in some countries as people fall ill with no known source of infection, shouldn’t we be asking whether it’s realistic to be trying to stop the spread of COVID-19 through the imposition of travel bans and other restrictions – as if the disease is as deadly as, say, H5N1? Or should we be regarding it as another influenza strain that we have to learn to manage and live with?



The evidence is definitely pointing to the latter.

Most of human history has been a struggle for food and energy.
The abundance of food in the western world during the last century or so is not the normal human condition. Snow and ice, drought and famine have been regular and persistent visitors to mankind.
We are lucky to live in a time of recent natural global warming. Warmth increases plant growth rate, lengthens the growing season, expands plant habitat and makes more land arable. As the oceans warm, they expel some of their vast reserves of carbon dioxide, the essential atmospheric plant food. Warm oceans also produce more evaporation, and thus more precipitation for adjacent land masses. Man’s recent production of carbon dioxide from burning coal and oil and calcining limestone has also helped to unlock buried carbon and restore valuable carbon dioxide to the biosphere.
Warmth, water and more abundant carbon dioxide have been the main causes of the 20th century Green Revolution which has enabled farmers to feed the growing millions on earth.
All these beneficial developments are threatened by two things – the distinct possibility of a return to natural global cooling, and silly government policies all over the western world that will slash food production.

The science used by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to support and justify its proposed rule “Standards of Performance for Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Existing Sources: Electric Utility Generating Units” generally fails to consider vital aspects of climate change and mankind’s role in it, including some of the most basic fundamentals, such as the sensitivity of the earth’s surface temperature to changes in carbon dioxide.



Absent an accurate accounting of the science, the EPA’s justification of its calculation of the social costs of carbon (SCC) and how that translates to “benefits” from the emissions reductions calculated to occur under this proposed rule is not only in error, but is grossly misleading. We show that a more plausible and justifiable determination of the SCC proves the costs to be near zero, with a good chance of being negative, meaning a net benefit.



The same applies to the health benefits presumed (and quantified) by the EPA. We demonstrate that the in the face of (or perhaps even as a result of) climate change, net human health and welfare are improving.



Further, basing its justification for action on assessment reports produced by the U.N.‘s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the U.S. Global Change Research Program raises serious doubts. Many concerns have been raised about robustness, thoroughness and degree of bias of these assessment efforts.



Perhaps most importantly, the EPA fails to quantify the projected climate impacts that expected to be mitigated by this proposed rule — a rule that was advanced for the expressed purpose of mitigating climate impacts. In these comments, we rectify that situation and perform the analysis that the EPA did not. In doing so, we demonstrate that the EPA’s proposed rule would result in no net benefits from avoided negative environmental effects as the environmental impacts of the proposed rule are negligible and scientifically undetectable.

"From these cooler years of the early 21st century, we look to a bleak future. A future where the Earth continues to heat, with more extreme weather, with parts of our planet made uninhabitable, leaving millions homeless and destitute. A future where we face the threat of mass extinctions, for which we are responsible. We will need all of our ingenuity and imagination to prevent this future from unfolding. As we see in the response to Covid-19, people can come together, and our governments can – when they need to – do the “impossible”. The climate and ecological emergency bill was introduced in parliament today by the Green party MP Caroline Lucas with our support. Drafted by scientists, academics and lawyers, it will – if backed all the way by MPs – strengthen the Climate Change Act and ensure that Britain has a comprehensive strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and restore our natural world.  The Committee on Climate Change says that the government’s 2050 net zero target gives us just a “greater than 50%” chance of limiting global heating to 1.5C if replicated across the world. We will need to make “rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society”, according to the UN, to keep below that threshold, and the bill presents a roadmap to achieve it. As the host of the UN climate conference next year, the government has a final opportunity to show the world, and those protesting on our streets this week, that it recognises the climate and nature emergency – and will deliver a serious plan to tackle it. Parliament now has a viable pathway to tackle this crisis.

"Poor air quality is responsible for over half a million deaths in Europe every year, but not everyone is equally at risk. Our new review found that across Europe, the most deprived people have the worst air quality. This means that the people already experiencing multiple deprivations because of their social class, ethnicity or gender, also have the unhealthiest environments to live in. In Wales, deprived areas have the highest levels of major pollutants, such as nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter, from traffic exhausts, industrial pollution and wood-burning stoves. Particulate matter forms a fine mist of toxic debris that affects more people than any other type of pollution. Inhaling it can contribute to heart attacks and respiratory diseases, including lung cancer.  For the very smallest particles, there’s no safe threshold below which “no damage to health is observed”, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Nitrogen dioxide meanwhile is linked to reduced lung function and growth in children and exacerbates asthma. In England and the Netherlands, areas where more people live on income support or where there is a larger non-white population experience poorer air quality. In France, deprivation is clearly linked to higher pollution in nearly all areas, with small exceptions in some rural areas. In Italy, places with higher numbers of single mothers have more air pollution. Ethnicity is also a factor when it comes to pollution. Asian and Latin American immigrants in Madrid are exposed to higher levels of pollution, but European immigrants aren’t. Whereas in Barcelona, all immigrants regardless of ethnicity have poorer air quality than native-born people. In southern Sweden, higher levels of nitrogen oxides occur in areas with non-Nordic mothers. In Switzerland, foreign nationals and the unemployed are both likely to live nearer to main roads and so encounter higher levels of particulates in the air they breathe. The EU has pressured national governments to deal with air pollution, but 19 countries still exceed the agreed nitrogen dioxide limits and 14 are breaching these limits for particulates smaller than 10 microns. But even air with pollutants at these supposedly safe limits may not be safe to breathe. The lower the level of air pollution, the lower the impact on health, and it’s likely that the WHO’s ongoing review will recommend even lower levels.

 Not only does your exposure to air pollution mirror existing inequalities, but so does your vulnerability to the health consequences. The same level of air pollutant will affect different people differently. For example, children, whose bodies are still forming, will be more affected than fully grown adults. Vulnerability also varies among adults. In deprived areas, more people are likely to have existing health conditions, making them more vulnerable to poor air quality. A UK study found that even a general improvement in air quality over time benefited the most deprived least, and the gap between rich and poor – in terms of the levels of particulates in the air – actually increased. Often poorer populations have lower levels of car ownership but are exposed to more motorists driving through their neighbourhoods. Traffic is a major source of air pollution. Cities need to provide cheap, reliable mass transport systems, such as trams, buses and underground rail, but they also need to create separate infrastructure for cyclists and walkers to make it much easier for drivers to switch. More electric vehicle charging zones, pedestrianisation of city roads and more barriers to private cars entering the city will also help. Efforts to improve air quality should target areas with vulnerable people first and should prioritise public health. Rather than seeking to beautify already affluent areas, action on pollution should address existing inequality by providing good quality public transport and investing in healthcare for deprived communities. Pollution is political – and so are its remedies."
"When we talk about innovations to deal with the climate crisis, we tend to think of new technologies developed by physical scientists. Although a real sense of climate emergency now seems to be permeating the global consciousness thanks to recent high-profile campaigning, many of us have been slow to actually make changes in the way we live ourselves. Finding out what it would take to motivate people to take practical steps to reduce emissions is where behavioural science comes in.  As an example, Glasgow City Council recently announced its aim to reduce net carbon emissions to zero by 2030. Some have cast doubt on the council’s capacity to achieve this ambitious target, not least because many sources of emissions are beyond its direct control.  Take the energy used by households in heating their homes. Glasgow is blessed and cursed by fine old buildings, but they require a lot of energy to heat. One challenge that the council faces is persuading owners of these buildings to retrofit them with efficient heating and insulation. Research suggests that money alone isn’t enough of an incentive. In Michigan in the US, 7,000 households were randomly selected to receive a visit by a community worker who explained the benefits of retrofitting heating and cooling systems and offered to help complete the paperwork that would deliver free materials and installation. The campaign did increase retrofitting relative to a control group from the same population, but the uptake accounted for just 6% of eligible households, at a cost of around US$1,000 per home. More hopeful research comes from the Behavioural Insights Team, an organisation that seeks to generate and apply behavioural insights to inform policy. In an experiment, it offered low-cost loft insulation to homeowners in London. Some were offered additional help to clear out their lofts so that the new materials could be installed. Again, the number of households taking up the offer was very small, but those offered help with clearing out their lofts showed higher uptake. Suffice to say, the hassle of retrofitting homes and buildings will be a big stumbling block to Glasgow City Council’s ambitious plan. This is precisely where behavioural science can help. Behavioural scientists study how minor tweaks can tip the balance towards behavioural change. Our research review recently discovered that the colour-coded categories on the energy efficiency labelling system used in houses for sale in the UK are already nudging investment in energy efficiency. Back in 2008, an EU-wide regulation came into effect that required an energy performance certificate (EPC) to be made available when a building is constructed, sold or rented. We speculated that house sellers who find their home at the top of one of the letter-colour bands on the scale might try to boost their house into the next band by installing small, energy-saving appliances, such as LED lightbulbs. After all, it costs little to make these changes, and when selling a house most people have to clear it out to make it presentable anyway. Importantly, you could potentially make more money selling a D-rated home, for example, than an an E-rated home. We looked to the English Housing Survey (EHS) to test our idea. In each wave of the EHS, the structural features of roughly 16,000 homes were recorded and entered into an algorithm, resulting in a rating for each home on a 1-100 standard assessment procedure (SAP) scale. With the introduction of the EPC in 2008, these SAP scores became the 1–100 numbers that we see on the right-hand side of the EPC efficiency label today.  When we analysed the EHS data, we found that, rather than the smooth distribution that would be expected, properties clustered at the lowest point in the D category, at 55 SAP points. When we focused in on homes that had recently been on the market, we found a pronounced spike at 55 SAP points and a shortfall of homes at 54 SAP points, the highest point in the E category. In other words, the data showed that sellers did indeed make the effort to boost their home across the arbitrary thresholds on the EPC label. The authorities should take note of this result. We calculated that the energy savings induced by the label in England scaled up to roughly 33,470 megawatt hours or, more intuitively, the total electricity consumed each year by a town of 27,702 people. One insight our results suggest is that authorities should be selective in the timing of subsidies for retrofitting. The evidence suggests that established households are reluctant to alter their properties. But catch people moving into or out of a property and they seem more willing to invest in retrofitting. A second insight concerns the design of the EPC label itself. As it stands, the thresholds from one category to the next are fixed at certain SAP points. As such, the label only affects a small proportion of properties – those that happen to score just shy of a threshold. I suggest that the seven A-G categories should be indicators of relative energy efficiency. The top seventh of properties in terms of energy efficiency would receive an A label, the next seventh would receive a B, and so on. As the housing stock becomes more efficient, the thresholds would move to higher SAP points. In time, properties that are currently distant from an SAP threshold might become close to moving up a category or, importantly, down a category. Since most people are averse to losing and concerned with rank and position, we would expect the prospect of dropping into a lower colour-letter band to be especially motivating. Glasgow’s 2030 target may well be ambitious, but if the city council looks to the innovations of behavioural science, it could find effective ways of tipping its citizens into making changes that could actually make a difference in reducing carbon emissions."

The use of science in public policy has recently been in the news, most prominently in the “March for Science” at over 600 locations around the globe. Thousands rallied “for science,” including climate change activists, anti‐​vaxxers, and those who are either for or against GMOs, not to mention those who just generally protested Donald Trump. Science was championed as the answer to our problems, with scientists such as Neil deGrasse Tyson and non‐​scientists like Bill Nye held up as messiahs for the noble cause.



Now Nye’s new Netflix show, _Bill Nye Saves the World_ , has come along to rescue us and our policies from scientific ignorance. The underlying message behind the March for Science and Nye’s show is that science can “solve” public policy problems if we would just let the scientists and technocrats take over. In one episode of his show, Nye pondered whether we should have policies that “penalize people for having extra kids in the developed world[,]” in order to combat climate change. (Will all the “extra kids” please stand up?) Population control movements have a long and sordid history, and have been endorsed by everyone from environmental catastrophists to anti‐​immigrationists to eugenicists.



Without a healthy respect for individual rights and personal choice, the use of science in public policy can be incredibly harmful. In order to understand why, it’s helpful to look at when and how science has been abused.





Without a healthy respect for individual rights and personal choice, the use of science in public policy can be incredibly harmful.



On October 19th, 1927, Carrie Buck was forcibly sterilized by the Commonwealth of Virginia. Buck was the first victim of Virginia’s 1924 Sterilization Act, a law passed because “human experience has demonstrated that heredity plays an important part in the transmission of insanity idiocy, imbecility, epilepsy, and crime.” Buck was an average girl who unwittingly got caught up in a misguided quest to put the “science” of eugenics into real‐​world use so as to purify the human genome through forced sterilization.



Buck fought her case all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ratified her sterilization by a vote of 8–1. In the majority opinion, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes infamously wrote that “three generations of imbeciles are enough.” (See my extensive discussion of the case’s history here).



Throughout the 1930s (but actually continuing beyond that), at least 60,000 Americans were forcibly sterilized. American eugenics research was later put to use by Hitler’s Germany and was even cited at the Nuremberg Trials.



Many books and articles have been written about the eugenics movement more broadly, including some popular books of a recent vintage. The American experience with eugenics, as well as the Australian experience with stealing children in order to quicken the demise of the aborigines, to cite just two examples, demonstrate that concerns about the misuse of science are not confined to totalitarian, murderous regimes.



But was bad “science” to blame for the ordeals suffered by Buck and thousands of others, or was it a misunderstanding of science’s role in public policy?



Perhaps the best way to answer this question is to ask a different one: What if criminality, poverty, and other social ills are strongly genetically correlated? Given what we now know about genetics, as well as how much we constantly are learning, it’s not far‐​fetched to believe that the vagaries of human genetics may eventually be understood. Rather than relying on poorly researched family trees and shoddy experiments — as they did in Carrie’s case — we may soon be able to identify specific genes for socially destructive behavior.



So, if the science is good, is some form of sterilization okay?



Of course not. Science — whether good or bad — does not solve our public policy problems. There is no “scientific” answer to how many “feeble‐​minded” people should be allowed to breed. That’s not because the science is bad, but because human rights are not playthings for the scientific establishment, whatever the prevailing orthodoxy. Given the stain of our eugenics past, most people probably understand this. But there’s also no scientific answer to how many people should smoke cigarettes or, yes, even to climate change. Science can, and should, inform public policy by discovering the likely outcomes and relevant causal factors, but it won’t tell us the relevant trade‐​offs we should make or what we should value. Science helps us understand how the world works. It doesn’t tell us what to do with that understanding.



Nye’s willingness to “go there” and consider some element of population control shows how those enamored with science as a solution to public policy problems can be easily led to monstrous conclusions.



Science has also been part of debates over questions where a little respect for individual rights and good sense was all that was needed. We don’t need scientists to discover a “gay gene” in order to conclude that prohibiting consenting adults from having sex is wrong, and we don’t need scientists to show us that children raised in same‐​sex households are well‐​adjusted in order to allow same‐​sex marriage and child‐​rearing. To even endorse such arguments is to imply that only genetically determined sexual preferences should be protected (sorry BDSM community) and that the state has the power to use “science” to generally determine (as opposed to specifically removing children from dangerous households) who is allowed to raise children. Finally, we don’t need science — and we especially don’t need horrible dance numbers from Bill Nye’s show — to tell us that transgendered people deserve our respect and care.



Without a vigorous respect for individual liberty, the tendency towards “scientism” can be dangerous. We haven’t entered a new golden age where the misuse and abuse of science in the name of public policy is no longer a concern. Science, in its trappings of authority, can be a dangerous enemy of individual rights and human freedom. Nye’s casual mention of population control shows how quickly scientific zealotry can lead to savagery.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. President Trump is quickly dismantling   policies. He revived two blocked pipeline projects: the Keystone XL pipeline, the focus of years of debate over energy needs and climate change and the Dakota Access pipeline, the target of intense Native American protests. Mr. Trump also pressed automakers to increase jobs in the U. S. But a new forecast of a federal budget deficit that could expand to almost $10 trillion over 10 years could complicate his agenda to slash taxes and ramp up spending. And the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, stood by Mr. Trump’s repetition of the false claim that only millions of illegal votes by undocumented immigrants cost him the popular vote. _____  2. On Capitol Hill, Mr. Trump’s pick to be secretary of health and human services, Representative Tom Price of Georgia, defended his investments in an Australian pharmaceutical company. And James Comey, above, told top agents that he’d been asked to remain as head of the F. B. I. averting another potentially bruising confirmation battle. It’s a delicate time for the intelligence community, which is looking into ties between Mr. Trump’s associates  —   including his former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort  —   and Russia. Mr. Trump said he’d name his Supreme Court pick next week. The top contenders are conservatives on federal appeals courts: William Pryor Jr. known for his opposition to abortion and gay rights, and Neil Gorsuch, more distinguished by credentials, erudition and relatively muted stances. _____ 3. This year’s Oscar nominations are out. Voters gave “La La Land” 14 nominations, a tie for the most in Academy Award history. The academy also honored six black actors  —   a record. They included Denzel Washington and Viola Davis for their roles in “Fences,” above. Here is the full list of nominees our critics’ rundown of surprises and snubs reactions from some of the nominees a form to complete your own ballot and a guide on how to stream the nominated movies. _____ 4. Israel, discarding diplomatic restraint just a few days into the Trump administration, approved the construction of 2, 500 housing units in West Bank settlements. A month ago, the Obama administration declined to veto a Security Council resolution that condemned Israeli settlements as a “flagrant violation of international law,” and a week ago, a gathering of world leaders warned Israel to stop expanding them. _____ 5. Two days of talks in Kazakhstan on the Syrian war concluded with an agreement by Iran, Russia and Turkey to enforce a partial  . But they didn’t say how, and none of the Syrians at the conference  —   neither the government, nor the rebels, above  —   signed the agreement, and the main result was solidifying Russia’s role in the diplomacy. _____ 6. The Manhattan jail holding the notorious drug lord known as El Chapo is said to be tougher than Guantánamo. A remarkable figure in the annals of crime history, with two escapes from   Mexican prisons, he was extradited to the U. S. last week. The lights are on almost 24 hours a day, security is extraordinarily stringent, and the most closely guarded prisoners are denied almost all human contact. But it has seen several successful escapes. _____ 7. The expensive wonder drugs approved in recent years to cure hepatitis C, which can lead to liver disease and cancer, offered the hope of resolving a huge public health problem in the U. S. and around the world. But a report coming out Wednesday warns of the possibility of serious side effects, including liver failure, and doctors said the issue warranted further study. The news set off a new round of debate over the risks of expedited approval for badly needed drugs. “Benefits and side effects evolve over the long term, not over 12 weeks,” an author of the study said. _____ 8. Burning dinner might seem like a mistake. But the art of strategic charring, browning and blackening has deep roots in many cuisines. Exercised with care, it can conjure a world of flavor. Chefs are embracing the technique. Consider moles made with charred and   ingredients, above, blackened avocado and, mmm, lamb heart ashes. _____ 9. Houston is preparing to welcome the Super Bowl on Feb. 5, and its leaders are eager to show off the makeover the city has undergone since it last hosted the game more than a decade ago. A hub for the oil and gas industries and the nation’s   city, Houston is on the upswing, boasting an array of new restaurants,   green space, and cultural and entertainment venues. _____ 10.

"The timing is impeccable. In the midst of political ferment across the world, and with anxiety about the coming winter hardening into dread, Extinction Rebellion is back. Over the weekend it has made its presence felt in towns and cities around the country; now, in the wake of several of its organisers being arrested, its activists and supporters are preparing to arrive on Tuesday at Parliament Square, outside the Welsh parliament in Cardiff, and in the centre of Manchester. As usual, those involved will presumably be portrayed as eccentric and dangerous merchants of despair. But whatever the sense of millenarian doom that sometimes hangs over its actions, plenty of the people at the heart of the movement are admirably practical, and focused on overcoming the daunting political challenges that climate change still presents. And in among the protests, there will be an example of what this means in practice: the climate and ecological emergency bill, partly conceived by people with close links to XR, and due to be formally launched on Wednesday.  The plan is supported by the Green party MP, Caroline Lucas – but obviously, the point is not whether it will make it into law. The bill is a neat means of doing two things. It highlights how much our politicians are defying the urgency of the moment. And, by presenting clear and precise proposals to drastically reduce carbon emissions and restore biodiversity in the same typefaces and official vocabulary as the laws that define whole swathes of our lives, it makes the prospect of radical action eminently imaginable. Reflecting a longstanding XR demand, one of the bill’s core elements is a citizens’ assembly, which would be convened to come up with specific plans to change society and the economy in line with the legislation’s fundamental aim. This would be much more than a consultative exercise: even if, for example, the government disagreed with any proposals that had won the support of more than 80% of the assembly, they still would have to be voted on by MPs. To some people, this might look like the stuff of possible frustration and defeat, but it would also mark the entry into the legislative process of a new, disruptive element, which might pull things away from charmed circles, lobbyists and Westminster’s eternal tendency to conservative groupthink. The idea is yet another manifestation of one of the few sources of promise to be found among the polarisation and chaos of 21st-century politics: the gloriously simple notion of bringing together groups of people representative of the population at large to try to plot a way through difficult issues, and thereby begin to reduce our susceptibility to division and rancour. In times as troubled as ours, that may sound almost absurd. The strange thing is, it actually appears to work. In Ireland, the Citizens’ Assembly begun in 2016 helped to pave the way for the country’s referendum on women’s reproductive rights. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have all created assemblies looking at an array of urgent issues, and the appeal of so-called deliberative democracy is spreading at a city and local level. In Bristol, for instance, after work by both the Green and Labour parties, a citizens’ assembly is about to start considering how to reshape the city in the wake of all the changes caused by the pandemic, backed by a council that seems minded to take its proposals seriously. The French citizens’ commission for the climate, created at the instigation of Emmanuel Macron after the gilets jaunes (yellow vest) protests, has had all but three of its 149 recommendations accepted by the president. And here, too, there are first steps being taken to use citizens’ assemblies to tackle the array of issues that swirl around the climate crisis. Last year, the Climate Assembly UK was set up by six House of Commons select committees, and its final report will be published on 10 September. Its task was to come up with recommendations that would meet the target of the UK achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 – written into law last year, and maligned by XR as woefully inadequate. But when I talked last week to people who had participated in the initiative, what was striking was the sense of a new way of dealing with questions of politics, policy and power. Adrian, a father of three from Belfast, had received one of 30,000 letters sent out randomly to people to establish the pool from which the assembly would be drawn. He had agreed to participate, he told me, out of “a sense of duty to society”. He had long thought of the climate crisis as an issue that demanded “a big change in thinking”, but beyond “recycling and putting stuff in the right-coloured bin”, had never been involved in any campaigns or protests. “It’s been brilliant,” he said. “Just seeing the diversity of the UK population represented in that room, and then having a dialogue, as opposed to what you typically see in the media now.” Among other issues, he had discussed “how we live – the amount of travel people do, the kinds of things people buy, and how our homes use energy”, and farming. There had been differences of opinion “from the first moment, but through it all, we came up with outputs we agreed on. We had to accept that there would be give and take.” As he spoke, some questions inevitably came to mind. For any citizens’ assembly to really feel as if it were deliberating on behalf of millions of people, wouldn’t its discussions have to be either broadcast or streamed, and wouldn’t the nastiness and bullying of social media now rule that out? Given that any assembly might easily be portrayed, however unfairly, as a fig leaf for politicians, would whatever it decided really cut through the cynicism that often defines the public’s view of politics? What of the people who may reject the very premise of an assembly convened to discuss how we seriously transform our lives? But as I listened to Adrian’s account of an experience he said had completely convinced him of the urgency of what was discussed, another thought soon won out: given the large-scale failure of our politicians, what else have we got? The novelist Elif Shafak has just published an insightful and very moving essay titled How to Stay Sane in an Age of Division. “We have all the tools to build our societies anew, reform our ways of thinking, fix the inequalities and end the discriminations, and choose earnest wisdom over snippets of information, choose empathy over hatred, choose humanism over tribalism,” she writes, “yet we don’t have much time or room for error while we are losing our planet, our only home.” Part of the answer to that quandary, perhaps, lies in a vision that will be central to this week’s XR protests but could not be more different: crowds of strangers calmly gathering in hotel meeting rooms and plotting the future on the basis of things we are in danger of forgetting – empathy, openness and the basic human ability to not just think about complex problems, but to actually solve them. • John Harris is a Guardian columnist"
"**On 9 June 2019, a massive protest took place in Hong Kong - a show of anger at planned changes to the territory's extradition laws.**
The Extradition Law Amendment Bill (ELAB) would have cleared the way for criminal suspects to be sent abroad for trial, even to places with which Hong Kong does not have an extradition treaty.
The alarm was that this would mean people could be sent to mainland China for trial. Protesters said this would risk them having an unfair trial, and make it too easy for China to come after political opponents in Hong Kong.
Six months on, the bill has been dropped but the anger has grown, and is now focused on the government and allegations of police abuses.
Here are some of the most striking pictures from the past six months of Hong Kong protest and rage.

"MEXICO CITY  —   When Donald J. Trump called some Mexican immigrants rapists, threatened to deport millions of them and promised to build a wall to keep others out, Mexican officials counseled caution, saying it was merely bluster from an unlikely candidate who, if elected, would never follow through. Now, after just five days in office, President Trump is looking a lot like Candidate Trump  —   and the Mexicans are furious. With just a few strokes of the pen on Wednesday, the new American president signed an executive order to beef up the nation’s deportation force and start construction on a new wall between the nations. Adding to the perceived insult was the timing of the order: It came on the first day of talks between top Mexican officials and their counterparts in Washington, and just days before a meeting between the two countries’ presidents. The action was enough to prompt President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico to consider scrapping his plans to visit the White House on Tuesday, according to Mexican officials. In a video message delivered over Twitter on Wednesday night, Mr. Peña Nieto did not address whether he would cancel the meeting, saying only that future steps would be taken in consultation with the country’s lawmakers. Instead, he reiterated his commitment to protect the interests of Mexico and the Mexican people, and chided the move in Washington to continue with the wall. “I regret and condemn the United States’ decision to continue with the construction of a wall that, for years now, far from uniting us, divides us,” he said. It mattered little to Mexicans whether Mr. Trump’s order would receive congressional approval or the funding required to fulfill it. The perceived insults endured during the campaign had finally turned into action. Decades of friendly relations between the nations  —   on matters involving trade, security and migration  —   seemed to be unraveling. Calls began to come in from across the political spectrum for Mr. Peña Nieto to cancel his visit, and to respond with greater fortitude to the perceived menace from President Trump. On Twitter, Mr. Trump’s action was referred to by politicians and historians as a “an offense to Mexico,” a “slap in the face” and a “monument to lies. ” Historians said that not since President Calvin Coolidge threatened to invade a “Soviet Mexico” had the United States so deeply antagonized the Mexican populace. “It is an unprecedented moment for the bilateral relationship,” said Genaro Lozano, a professor at the Iberoamerican University in Mexico City. “In the 19th century, we fought a war with the U. S. now we find ourselves in a   war, a commercial one over Nafta and an immigration war due to the measures he just announced. ” The fear of many in Mexico is that Mr. Trump’s remarks will force Mr. Peña Nieto’s hand. While the Mexican president has opted for dialogue over confrontation, the building pressure, and perceived slights, could complicate his agenda. That could ultimately lead to disastrous consequences. With Nafta gone, both countries would be likely to suffer significant damage to their economies, and Mexico could see a sharp decline in foreign investment. The United States, meanwhile, might find its southern neighbor far less willing to cooperate on issues of security. Pressure from the political opposition could also color the Mexican government’s response. During a rally, the leftist politician Andrés Manuel López Obrador asked for Mr. Peña Nieto to appeal to the United Nations and accused Mr. Trump of “violating human rights” and of racism. Mr. López Obrador, who ran a close race against Mr. Peña Nieto for president in 2012, said the actions by Mr. Trump on Wednesday were “a great opportunity for Peña to begin his defense of Mexican immigrants, with steadiness and dignity. ” And while Mexico does not want a war of words  —   or a trade war  —   with Washington, the dynamic has already started to change. In recent days, top government officials said they would be willing to walk away from Nafta if the negotiations did not suit Mexico’s interests. That position was unthinkable even a few months ago. For a new American president, Mr. Trump is both well known in Mexico and widely disliked. His remarks have unified an otherwise fractious country, where corruption, a shaky rule of law and economic struggles have alienated many and kept them from becoming politically engaged. As Mr. Trump’s promises have begun to materialize into action, the public discourse is changing. Some fear the worst. “Diplomatic relations are ever changing, never static, but there is a real concern that this wall, as a powerful symbol of national resolve, will unleash a blunt, raw nationalism in Mexico,” said Allert   a professor of international relations at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico. “It would be similar to the one the American government is showing, and would undermine all efforts for the relations to go back to their normal state. ” The Trump broadside on Wednesday, coming as the Mexican foreign minister, Luis Videgaray, was to begin preliminary talks in Washington, was a new low in bilateral relations. Mr. Videgaray orchestrated Mr. Trump’s visit to Mexico during the campaign last year, when he was finance minister. The move drew such widespread condemnation that Mr. Videgaray resigned. After Mr. Trump’s victory, Mr. Videgaray’s fortunes revived and he became foreign minister. But any hope that his invitation to Washington could be leveraged in Mexico’s favor now seem dashed. Many Mexicans said conciliatory gestures were no longer an option. “It’s like we are Charlie Brown and they are Lucy with the football,” said Jorge Castañeda, a former foreign minister. “Peña is a weak president in a weak country at a weak moment, but he has to find a way to get some official backbone. ” Still, despite the outrage, there was a recognition that the action was more political than substantive, like the wall itself. A meaningful stretch of the United States border is already lined with a wall, and illegal immigration persists. “Symbolic gestures are not going to change the fact that we’re neighbors and that our countries will affect each other in perpetuity,” said Carlos Pascual, a former United States ambassador to Mexico. “We have no choice but to keep working for better solutions. ” Others took talk of a wall with a grain of salt, figuring Mexican creativity, or ingenuity, would render it useless anyway. “This is just politics, it won’t upend life in Mexico,” said Ariel Najum, 39, who runs a family business. “You know how Mexicans are: If they go high, we go underneath, with tunnels. ”"

You Ought to Have a Look _is a regular feature from the Center for the Study of Science. While this section will feature all of the areas of interest that we are emphasizing, the prominence of the climate issue is driving a tremendous amount of web traffic. Here we post a few of the best in recent days, along with our color commentary._   
  
_\---_   
  
This week we focus on an in-depth article in Slate authored by Sam Apple that profiles John Arnold, “one of the least known billionaires in the U.S.” Turns out Mr. Arnold is very interested in “fixing” science. His foundation, the Arnold Foundation, has provided a good deal of funding to various research efforts across the country and across disciplines aimed at investigating how the scientific incentive structure results in biased (aka “bad”) science. His foundation has supported several high-profile science-finding replication efforts, such as those being run by Stanford’s John Ioannidis (whose work we are very fond of) and University of Virginia’s Brian Nosek who runs a venture called the “Reproducibility Project” (and who pioneered the badge system of rewards for open science that we previously discussed). The Arnold Foundation has also provided support for the re-examining of nutritional science, an effort lead by Gary Taubes (also a favorite of ours), as well as investigations into the scientific review process behind the U.S. government’s dietary guidelines, spearheaded by journalist Nina Teicholz.   
  
Apple writes that:   




In my conversations with Arnold and his grantees, the word _incentives_ seems to come up more than any other. The problem, they claim, isn’t that scientists don’t want to do the right thing. On the contrary, Arnold says he believes that most researchers go into their work with the best of intentions, only to be led astray by a system that rewards the wrong behaviors.



This is something that we, too, repeatedly highlight at the Center for the Study of Science and investigating its impact is what we are built around.   
  
Apple continues:   




[S]cience, itself, through its systems of publication, funding, and advancement—had become biased toward generating a certain kind of finding: novel, attention grabbing, but ultimately unreliable…   
  
“As a general rule, the incentives related to quantitative research are very different in the social sciences and in financial practice,” says James Owen Weatherall, author of _The Physics of Wall Street_. “In the sciences, one is mostly incentivized to publish journal articles, and especially to publish the sorts of attention-grabbing and controversial articles that get widely cited and picked up by the popular media. The articles have to appear methodologically sound, but this is generally a lower standard than being completely convincing. In finance, meanwhile, at least when one is trading with one’s own money, there are strong incentives to work to that stronger standard. One is literally betting on one’s research.”





Another term for “betting on one’s research” is having some “skin in the game”—a concept that Judy Curry expounds upon on in her blog piece on her transition from academia to her weather and climate forecasting business, for   




reasons hav[ing] to do with my growing disenchantment with universities, the academic field of climate science and scientists…The reward system that is in place for university faculty members is becoming increasingly counterproductive to actually educating students to be able to think and cope in the real world, and in expanding the frontiers of knowledge in a meaningful way (at least in certain fields that are publicly relevant such as climate change).



Further, she said   




I said in my post JC in transition that I thought that the private sector is a more ‘honest’ place for a scientist than academia. In this context, in the private sector you have skin in the game with regards to weather forecasts (and shorter term climate forecasts), whereas in academia scientists have no skin in the game in terms of the climate change projections.   
  
Making shorter term weather or climate forecasts, with some skin in the game, would be very good experience for academic climate scientists. And this experience just might end up changing their perspectives on uncertainty and forecast confidence.



In the Slate article, Apple sees the ultimate efforts of Arnold and those he’s helping to support, as trying to tap into scientists’ natural inclination towards providing valuable research, and, much as Curry suggests, finding ways to alter the existing incentive structure towards that goal:   




Scientists really do want to discover things that make a difference in people’s lives. In a sense, that’s the strongest weapon that we have. We can feed off that. Figuring out exactly which rewards work best and how to simultaneously change the incentives for researchers, institutions, journals, and funders is now a key area of interest…



We couldn’t agree more.   
  
Be sure to check out Apple’s full article for some great background on John Arnold and more details from the efforts that he supports, as well Judy’s excellent set of posts her reasons for leaving academia and heading full-time into the private sphere. You ought to have a look.   
  
And before we go, we wanted to pass along this bit of carbon tax news:   




Tesla Motors Inc. founder Elon Musk is pressing the Trump administration to adopt a tax on carbon emissions, raising the issue directly with President Donald Trump and U.S. business leaders at a White House meeting Monday regarding manufacturing.   
  
A senior White House official said Musk floated the idea of a carbon tax at the meeting but got little or no support among the executives at the White House, signaling that Trump’s conservative political orbit remains tepid on the issue.

In grasslands, longer spring growing season offsets higher summer temperatures
North American grasslands face mixed bag of climate change effects

From the NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION
Grasslands across North America will face higher summer temperatures and widespread drought by the end of the century, according to a new study.
But those negative effects in vegetation growth will be largely offset, the research predicts, by an earlier start to the spring growing season and warmer winter temperatures.
Led by ecologists Andrew Richardson and Koen Hufkens of Harvard University, a team of researchers developed a detailed model that enables predictions of how grasslands from Canada to Mexico will react to climate change.
The model is described in a paper published today in the journal Nature Climate Change.
New insights into climate change effects on grasslands
“This research brings new insights into predicting future climate-driven changes in grasslands,” says Elizabeth Blood, program director in the National Science Foundation’s Division of Environmental Biology, which funded the research. “The results show that annual grassland cover and productivity will increase despite drought-induced reductions in summer productivity and cover.”
Ultimately the growing season gets split into two parts, Hufkens said. “You have an earlier spring flush of vegetation, followed by a summer depression where the vegetation withers, then at the end of the season, you see the vegetation rebound again.”
Adds Richardson, “The good news is that total grassland productivity is not going to decline, at least for most of the region. But the bad news is that we’re going to have this new seasonality that is outside of current practices for rangeland management — and how to adapt to that is unknown.”
To understand the effects of climate change on grasslands, the scientists created a model of the hydrology and vegetation of the region. They used data from the PhenoCam Network, a collection of some 250 Internet-connected cameras that capture images of local vegetation conditions every half-hour.
Using 14 sites that represent a variety of climates, the biologists ran the model against a metric of “greenness” to ensure that it could reproduce results in line with real-world observations.
“These were sites from across North America, from Canada to New Mexico and from California to Illinois,” Richardson said. “We used the greenness of the vegetation as a proxy for the activity of that vegetation. We were then able to run the model into the future.”
The region was divided into thousands of 10 square-kilometer blocks, allowing researchers to spot important differences in the response to climate change.
“That allows us to look at how patterns emerge in different areas,” Hufkens said.
Importantly, Richardson said, the model also uses a daily rather than monthly time step.
Changing seasonal patterns bring challenges
“Grasslands are different than forests in that they respond very quickly to moisture pulses,” said Richardson. “This model takes advantage of that — by running at a daily time scale, it can better represent changing patterns.”
The changing conditions could present challenges for farmers, ranchers and others who rely on predictable seasonal changes to manage the landscape.
“These shifting seasons will present new tests for management practices,” Richardson cautioned.
For grasslands, the increases in production and losses due to higher summer temperatures largely balance out, Hufkens said.
Although the results suggest that climate change may have some positive effects, both Hufkens and Richardson warned that they are the result of a delicate balance.
“It’s getting more arid and that’s causing more intense summer droughts, but because of a changing seasonality, vegetation growth is shifting,” said Richardson.
The negative effects of drought on ecosystem production can be offset, he believes. “But that raises new questions about appropriate management responses,” he said.
“Relying on this increase in productivity, or expecting that climate change will have long-term benefits because of results like this, is like playing the lottery — the odds are not very good.”

"**Hong Kong has announced that all schools including kindergartens will be closed on Thursday as the territory faces another day of escalating unrest.**
The Education Bureau announced the unprecedented step on Wednesday, citing safety reasons.
Officials said schools would remain open for children needing supervision.
The Chinese University of Hong Kong also said it would cancel classes for the rest of term after a violent standoff between police and protesters.
The university, one of Hong Kong's most prestigious, saw clashes overnight on Tuesday as police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at masked protesters, who in turn started fires and threw petrol bombs.
Clashes then continued in different parts of the city, just hours after a senior police officer said Hong Kong had been pushed to the ""brink of a total breakdown"".
The police decision to enter campuses signalled a shift in strategy, correspondents say, as they have largely avoided clearance operations at schools and universities.
Throughout the night there were chaotic scenes of explosions, smoke, and the firing of rubber bullets. Scores of people were injured, reports said.
""This is not only to defend the Chinese University of Hong Kong. It represents the human spirit of defending political freedom and the rights which should be enjoyed by Hong Kongers,"" one student told the BBC.
Paramedics were treating at least 70 people after the clashes, local media reported, with at least four seriously hurt.
About 142 people have been arrested since Tuesday, raising the total number to more than 4,000 since the unrest started.
In a statement, China's liaison office in the territory said Hong Kong was ""sliding into the abyss of terrorism"", and urged the government to toughen its crackdown.
Images on Wednesday showed students and demonstrators still at the Chinese University (CUHK) campus, some armed with petrol bombs or other weapons including bows and arrows.
Police displayed some of the arrows at a press conference, claiming they could have pierced officers' protective gear.
CUHK is not the only campus involved.
At universities across the city, anti-government protesters fortified barricades and stockpiled food and projectiles on Wednesday, as police said the violence had reached a ""very dangerous and even deadly level"". There are fears more clashes could follow.
In a statement, CUHK said it was shortening the academic term and would not resume classes until 6 January 2020, ""in view of the escalation of social movements across the territory, the continuous disruption to public transport services [and] the severe damage done to facilities"".
Police said they had assisted a group of mainland Chinese students who wanted to leave the campus for safety reasons but were unable to do so due to ""roadblocks set up by mobs"".
Pictures circulated on social media showing a crowd at Ma Liu Shui Ferry Pier waiting to board a police boat.
Several other Hong Kong universities, among them Open University and City University, said they had cancelled Thursday's classes.
Many went further and closed for the rest of the week. Baptist University suspended on-campus classes entirely until the end of term on 3 December, saying it would replace some with online sessions.
Protesters called for a third day of strikes with disruption at several metro stations, leading to a morning of long delays and queues.
Activists continued to block roads and build barricades, causing confrontations with police in Yuen Long.
Fresh lunchtime protests in the financial district saw crowds gather to chant slogans. Some black-clad protesters also vandalised a branch of the mainland Bank of Communications.
A session at the city's parliament, known as the Legislative Council, was briefly suspended after opposition politicians angrily questioned the security chief over alleged police brutality.
This week has seen a marked escalation in violence with intense street battles, violent clashes at universities and flashmob lunchtime protests in the financial heart of Hong Kong.
It is the first time in weeks that protests have taken place during weekdays.
Monday's protests followed a weekend of vigils and demonstrations after a 22-year-old student protester died on Friday.
Alex Chow had been in hospital since he fell from the ledge of a car park during a police operation a week ago.
Later on Monday, violence escalated further when a police officer shot an activist in the torso with a live bullet and a pro-government supporter was set on fire by protesters.
Hong Kong is part of China but as a former British colony it has some autonomy and people have more rights.
The protests started in June against plans to allow extradition to the mainland - which many feared would erode the city's freedoms.
The bill was withdrawn in September, but the demonstrations continued. They now call for full democracy and an inquiry into police actions.
Clashes between police and activists have become increasingly violent, and in October the city banned all face masks."
"This month the US Democrats wrapped up polling in Pennsylvania, a north-east industrial state that four years ago went to Donald Trump by 44,000 votes. Among other things the polling found that voters didn’t like Trump’s deregulation of methane. Voters supported a phasing out of fossil fuels. This is happy news for Democrats given that Biden has already committed to impose “aggressive new methane limits” on gas and oil operations by presidential executive action on day one of his presidency. This was set out in his clean energy and environmental justice plan. It embraces decarbonisation as part of an economic rebuild.  During the primaries he spoke about $1.7tn over 10 years. But in a 14 July landmark speech he crammed $2tn into a mere four years, pitched in terms of more “high-paying union jobs” generated in a swiftly decarbonising economy. Canberra needs to catch up with this because it threatens to leave Australia at odds with an American administration defining itself through climate diplomacy, something Biden signalled with a Foreign Affairs article in March. Biden is pledging no carbon at all in the power network by 2035 – phasing coal and gas out of the system rapidly – and the hugely ambitious target of net zero emissions by 2050. As one of his advisors told me: “Oil and gas people want to pretend he is their friend. But look at his speech. It’s all about accelerating the pace to zero carbon energy and electrification of transport.” He went on to say: “If you want zero carbon power by 2035 you are pushing a lot of gas out of the system.” There is nowhere in Biden’s campaign material from the primaries, his Foreign Affairs article or his landmark environment speech in July any rhetoric about gas as a bridging fuel. His adviser says he is not going to be using “bridging fuel” language. This alone draws a line with Australia and the enthusiasm for gas of the prime minister and his energy minister and of the national Covid-19 Coordination Commission, advised by Andrew Liveris, which is reportedly telling Canberra to massively invest in gas. Biden’s policy even rules out donations from gas corporations and executives. Biden will, however, bring joy to some on the right in Australia: he will protect America’s existing nuclear fleet. He promises to support development of small, modular nuclear reactors, although this notion has been around so long without signs of the promised nuclear renaissance it almost rivals carbon capture and storage (CCS) as sound theory that stubbornly resists commercial realisation. Carbon tariffs will figure in the Biden agenda. They appeal to the trade-sceptics in the party who need to hold their working class base as well as to supporters of the Green New Deal. They provide an opportunity to wave a stick at China and India for producing cheap exports with profligate carbon. Such “border adjustment mechanisms” were part of the American Clean Energy and Security Act which passed the House of Representatives in 2009 but failed in the Senate. Biden will likely recruit Canada and then begin negotiations with the EU and UK, with Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, having publicly supported carbon tariffs. It implies the US leading a pro-climate block. Two former Republican secretaries of state, James A Baker III and George P Shultz, called this year for a US-led climate alliance. They also urged a “carbon customs alliance” to take in Japan, Asean and South Korea to press China and India. Their joint article didn’t mention us. Where might we be seen? Democrats will easily be reminded our prime minister stood in parliament to hold aloft a block of coal. Our bushfire crisis was invoked by senior Democrat adviser John Podesta to open his own Foreign Affairs article on “A Foreign Policy for the Climate” in June. The Podesta article mentioned Japan and New Zealand as natural partners but not Australia. In fact Australia may be sailing perilously close to being cast by Biden’s team with other climate resisters Brazil and Saudi Arabia, and with mega polluter China as well. Yet even China’s status as coal-fired enthusiast could be altered by the new dynamic of climate diplomacy. At present China has embraced coal-fired power plant construction as part of its economic revival. But this coal “snapback” can be overtaken by the process of the next five-year plan hauling China’s policies back to nuclear and renewables. Biden will make huge play castigating China’s funding of coal-fired activity in its Belt and Road Initiative. But it would be relatively easy for China to switch to renewables under the BRI – that is, if both superpowers want to work up collaboration on climate policy to balance the competition that will dominate their relationship on technology, cyber and geostrategy. All the more reason for Australia to be ready for Biden on climate. That is, if such a devoted ally wants to be in the next president’s climate club. • Bob Carr is a former premier of New South Wales and foreign affairs minister of Australia.

I am deeply chagrined to see Brad DeLong take me to the woodshed for mischaracterizing one aspect of Prof. Parth Dasgupta’s criticism of the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change.   
  
  
Prof. Dasgupta does not criticize Stern’s use of a 0.1% discount rate (that’s Prof. William Nordhaus’ job) per se. He criticizes the use of that discount rate while _simultaneously_ ignoring the difference in well‐​being between present and future generations. That was indeed the point of my post, but I inadvertently suggested that Prof. Dasgupta complaint resided in the discount rate.   
  
  
_Mea culpa_.

Following his remarks at the Cato Institute on Friday, podcast producer Anastasia Uglova sat down with the President of the Czech Republic Vaclav Klaus to discuss his views on global climate change. During the interview, the President reiterated his belief that environmentalism is more religion than science, calling it “a very illiberal ideology practically attacking our freedom.” President Klaus’ speech comes a month after calling global warming a “myth” in a Czech newspaper.

"How does your food shop affect the planet? Well, think of it like this – consuming just one egg emits between 260 and 330g of CO₂ to the atmosphere. That’s because before that egg can reach your plate, animal feed has to be produced and delivered to the hen that laid it. That hen then needs heating pumped into the shed it shares with the other hens on the farm, and their eggs have to be transported, often by van, to the shop you buy them from, where they’re stored in refrigerators. There’s also the packaging that must be made to store the eggs and the process of cooking them to consider. All of this takes energy, which, more often than not, is generated using fossil fuels. We can analyse the carbon footprint of a particular food item by working out the quantity of greenhouse gases that are emitted during the production of raw materials, industrial processing, transport, storage, cooking, consumption, and waste. This is called the “cradle-to-grave” approach. It can help people better understand how the things we use every day affect the world around us. With that in mind, here are four simple rules to help you reduce the carbon footprint of your food basket during your next shopping trip. Of all livestock, cows require the most pasture land and the most feed from land-intensive crops. Their burps also generate large quantities of planet-warming methane, making the carbon footprint of beef on average four times higher than pork and poultry. Lamb has a high carbon footprint, and its consumption should be also reduced.   Grains, beans, lentils, soya and tofu, nuts and seeds, mushrooms, and seaweed all contain high levels of protein and require far smaller inputs than animals to grow, giving them a very low carbon footprint. A recent study showed that it’s possible to reduce dietary greenhouse gas emissions by 80%, just by reducing meat consumption by 70% and dairy consumption by 65%. In the absence of calculated carbon footprints on food labels, consumers commonly use other information on labels to estimate the environmental impact. But these can often mislead. Consumers may associate “organic” or “free range” with higher environmental quality (low pesticide intensity and more natural animal rearing), and by extension assume that they are low-carbon products. But while some organic products, such as milk or olive oil, typically have a lower carbon footprint than regular equivalents, the reverse is true for soy milk and organic and free-range eggs versus barn eggs. For pasta, there’s generally no difference between organic and non-organic varieties.

      Going entirely organic could mean food emissions up 70% in England and Wales


 Of course, caring for animal welfare and supporting the limited use of chemical fertiliser are important considerations too. But avoid using these keywords to estimate the carbon burden of foods. Buying local products doesn’t guarantee a smaller carbon footprint. Transport is an important contributor to the carbon cost of foods but its not the only carbon cost. In fact, the carbon contribution of transport is higher in low-carbon than high-carbon foods. To this extent, the “food miles” concept, should not be used as an indicator of carbon footprint, because it only considers the transport element of the carbon footprint. For instance, transport does not increase the footprint for high-carbon products such as meat by much, and it may transpire that lamb from New Zealand in the season of slaughter has lower carbon emissions than British lamb out of season, primarily because of the much lower carbon footprint at rearing, due to more favourable weather that allows the animals to eat more grass and less animal feed. On the other hand, green beans from Kenya or asparagus from Peru will have a low carbon footprint at production, but their carbon footprint is much increased by the flight that gets them to supermarket shelves in the UK. Going local is useful for fruit and vegetables in season, but the carbon emitted by growing them in greenhouses in winter means that importing from a country where the produce is in season is usually more sustainable. Of course, best of all would be to eat in synchrony with the natural seasons where you live, if possible.

      What does a healthy diet look like for me and the planet? It depends where you live


 The carbon footprint of transport can be lower for processed products too. Shipping ground coffee instead of coffee beans or concentrated orange juice rather than oranges implies only transporting the final product, without the waste or the extra water, and using less refrigeration and less packaging. As a result, concentrated orange juice emits less CO₂ than fresh orange juice, and grinding coffee where beans are grown may be more sustainable than importing the beans to be ground elsewhere. Plastic packaging is not always the evil it’s made out to be. Some packaging options, particularly tin and glass, are very heavy, and so can only be transported in smaller quantities. This means that their transport requires more energy per unit of food. As a result, switching from these types of materials to plastic, which is considerably lighter, can reduce carbon emissions. This is particularly the case if the plastic is recyclable. Plastic packaging can be better than no packaging in some cases. In extending the shelf life of fresh produce, plastic can be an ally in reducing food waste – which produces methane if it goes to landfill.

The simplistic notion that organisms are “dumb” when it comes to changing environments goes like this: Species X lives in a relatively stable environment and with a certain defined range of temperature. So, if the temperature changes enough, species X will go extinct.   
  
In resuming our series on biological adaptation to environmental change, we are going to be looking in depth at the evolutionary and environmental nuances that—with some limits—invalidate the simple point of view. And, in doing so, we will discover important implications for environmental and climate-related policies.   
  
We begin with revolutionary classic in evolutionary biology published in 1984 by Peter Hochachka and George Somero called “Biochemical Adaptation.” It summarized and expanded on much of their earlier work on what they called “phenotypic plasticity”.



Pre-Hochachka thinking had it that our DNA codes for specific proteins, which do their thing (often serving as catalysts for complex biochemical syntheses) and are pretty much static, which would lead automatically to the “dumb” organism when it comes to environmental change. But, among other things, Hochachka and Somero can show that, depending upon temperature, many critical proteins actually change their shape as temperature rises (or falls), greatly broadening the environmental range of many species.   
  
A wonderful example of this concerns marine fish living in tropical waters, which tend to experience much smaller seasonal variations in temperature than fish inhabiting other latitudes. Without phenotypic plasticity, there are concerns that tropical fish maintain narrow temperature tolerance and that they might presently be close to their optimal temperature limit. If temperatures were to therefore rise in the future in response to CO2-induced global warming, many tropical fish species might experience widespread decline and possible _extinction_.   
  
Given plasticity, does this hypothesis hold any water?   
  
A five-member Portuguese research team of Madeira _et al_. (2016) examined the cellular stress response of a tropical clownfish species ( _Amphiprion ocellaris_ ) exposed to elevated temperatures over a period of one month. Their experiment was conducted in a controlled laboratory setting in which they subjected juvenile _A. ocellaris_ to either ambient (26°C) or elevated (30°C) temperatures, while examining several biomarkers (e.g., stress proteins and antioxidants) in several tissue types (brain, gills, liver, intestine and muscle) at 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days of temperature treatment. What did their measurements reveal?   






_Amphiprion ocellaris_



According to Madeira _et al_., “results showed that exposure time significantly interacted with temperature responses and tissue-type, so in fact time influenced the organisms’ reaction to elevated temperature.” First, at day 7 they observed significantly higher levels of biomarkers in fish in the high temperature environment that was indicative of a typical thermal stress response. Thereafter, however, they report that biomarker levels stabilized, showing either “a significant decrease in comparison with controls or no significant differences from the control” through the end of the experiment, which observations they suggest are indicative of temperature acclimation.   
  
The fact that temperatures outside the “normal” range elicited clear biochemical changes (after a period of initial stress) is clear evidence for the much more nuanced view of organismal response to change.   
  
Commenting on their findings, Madeira _et al_. write that “ _A. ocellaris_ probably lives far from its upper thermal limit and is capable of adjusting the protein quality control system and enzymes’ activities to protect cell functions under elevated temperature, adding that “these results suggest that this coral reef fish species presents a significant acclimation potential under ocean warming scenarios of +4°C.”   
  
This is very good news for those concerned about the impact of global warming on tropical reef fish, and therefore for reefs themselves, as fish are an integral part of complex reef ecology.   
  
One _could_ speculate that—because most species alive today evolved on a warmer (pre-ice age) planet, that the genetic material that responds to heat is maintained, only to be expressed when they go back to their future, which is what is happening as we speak.

"**Anti-government protests have rocked Hong Kong for months and the situation shows no sign of dying down.**
Here's all the background you need to know in 100 or 500 words - you can read each individually or in turn.
Hong Kong's protests started in June against plans to allow extradition to mainland China.
Critics feared this could undermine judicial independence and endanger dissidents.
Until 1997, Hong Kong was ruled by Britain as a colony but then returned to China. Under the ""one country, two systems"" arrangement, it has some autonomy, and its people more rights.
The bill was withdrawn in September but demonstrations continue and now demand full democracy and an inquiry into police actions.
Clashes between police and activists have become increasingly violent, with police firing live bullets and protesters attacking officers and throwing petrol bombs.
The extradition bill which triggered the first protest was introduced in April. It would have allowed for criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China under certain circumstances.
Opponents said this risked exposing Hongkongers to unfair trials and violent treatment. They also argued the bill would give China greater influence over Hong Kong and could be used to target activists and journalists.
Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets. After weeks of protests, leader Carrie Lam eventually said the bill would be suspended indefinitely.
Protesters feared the bill could be revived, so demonstrations continued, calling for it to be withdrawn completely.
By then clashes between police and protesters had become more frequent and violent.
In September, the bill was finally withdrawn, but protesters said this was ""too little, too late"".
On 1 October, while China was celebrating 70 years of Communist Party rule, Hong Kong experienced one of its most ""violent and chaotic days"".
An 18-year-old was shot in the chest with a live bullet as protesters fought officers with poles, petrol bombs and other projectiles.
The government then banned protesters wearing face masks, and in early November a pro-Beijing lawmaker was stabbed in the street by a man pretending to be a supporter.
One week later, a policeman shot one protester at close range when activists were trying to set up a road block. Later that day another man was set on fire by anti-government protesters.
In November, a standoff between police and students barricaded on the campus of Hong Kong's Polytechnic University became another defining moment.
Later that month, the territory held local council elections that were seen as a barometer of public opinion.
The vote saw a landslide victory for the pro-democracy movement, with 17 of the 18 councils now controlled by pro-democracy councillors.
Some protesters have adopted the motto: ""Five demands, not one less!"" These are:
The fifth demand, the withdrawal of the bill, has already been met.
Protests supporting the Hong Kong movement have spread across the globe, with rallies taking place in the UK, France, US, Canada and Australia.
In many cases, people supporting the demonstrators were confronted by pro-Beijing rallies.
Chinese president Xi Jinping has warned against separatism, saying any attempt to divide China would end in ""bodies smashed and bones ground to powder"".
Hong Kong is a former British colony handed back to China in 1997.
It has its own judiciary and a separate legal system from mainland China. Those rights include freedom of assembly and freedom of speech.
But those freedoms - the Basic Law - expire in 2047 and it is not clear what Hong Kong's status will then be.

And watch this:"
"The annual World Economic Forum in Davos brought together representatives from government and business to deliberate how to solve the worsening climate and ecological crisis. The meeting came just as devastating bush fires were abating in Australia. These fires are thought to have killed up to one billion animals and generated a new wave of climate refugees. Yet, as with the COP25 climate talks in Madrid, a sense of urgency, ambition and consensus on what to do next were largely absent in Davos. But an important debate did surface – that is, the question of who, or what, is to blame for the crisis. Famed primatologist Dr Jane Goodall remarked at the event that human population growth is responsible, and that most environmental problems wouldn’t exist if our numbers were at the levels they were 500 years ago.  This might seem fairly innocuous, but its an argument that has grim implications and is based on a misreading of the underlying causes of the current crises. As these escalate, people must be prepared to challenge and reject the overpopulation argument. Paul Ehrlich’s The Population Bomb and Donella Meadows’ The Limits to Growth in the late 1960s and early 1970s ignited concerns over the world’s burgeoning human population, and its consequences for natural resources.  The idea that there were simply too many people being born – most of them in the developing world where population growth rates had started to take off – filtered into the arguments of radical environmental groups such as Earth First! Certain factions within the group became notorious for remarks about extreme hunger in regions with burgeoning populations such as Africa – which, though regrettable, could confer environmental benefits through a reduction in human numbers. In reality, the global human population is not increasing exponentially, but is in fact slowing and predicted to stabilise at around 11 billion by 2100. More importantly, focusing on human numbers obscures the true driver of many of our ecological woes. That is, the waste and inequality generated by modern capitalism and its focus on endless growth and profit accumulation. The industrial revolution that first married economic growth with burning fossil fuels occurred in 18th-century Britain. The explosion of economic activity that marked the post-war period known as the “Great Acceleration” caused emissions to soar, and it largely took place in the Global North. That’s why richer countries such as the US and UK, which industrialised earlier, bear a bigger burden of responsibility for historical emissions. In 2018 the planet’s top emitters – North America and China – accounted for nearly half of global CO₂ emissions. In fact, the comparatively high rates of consumption in these regions generate so much more CO₂ than their counterparts in low-income countries that an additional three to four billion people in the latter would hardly make a dent on global emissions.  There’s also the disproportionate impact of corporations to consider. It is suggested that just 20 fossil fuel companies have contributed to one-third of all modern CO₂ emissions, despite industry executives knowing about the science of climate change as early as 1977.

      Climate action must now focus on the global rich and their corporations


 Inequalities in power, wealth and access to resources – not mere numbers – are key drivers of environmental degradation. The consumption of the world’s wealthiest 10% produces up to 50% of the planet’s consumption-based CO₂ emissions, while the poorest half of humanity contributes only 10%. With a mere 26 billionaires now in possession of more wealth than half the world, this trend is likely to continue. Issues of ecological and social justice cannot be separated from one another. Blaming human population growth – often in poorer regions – risks fuelling a racist backlash and displaces blame from the powerful industries that continue to pollute the atmosphere. Developing regions in Africa, Asia and Latin America often bear the brunt of climate and ecological catastrophes, despite having contributed the least to them.  The problem is extreme inequality, the excessive consumption of the world’s ultra-rich, and a system that prioritises profits over social and ecological well-being.

"**A Hong Kong tour guide jailed for 45 months for stabbing three people during last year's anti-government protests has received a judge's sympathy.**
The judge compared the protesters to an army that had brought fundamental change to Hong Kong.
Judge Kwok Wai-kin said the defendant was himself a ""victim"" of the anti-government unrest.
The three victims needed hospital treatment, and one of them was critically wounded.
Tony Hung Chun attacked a newspaper reporter and two others with a meat cleaver at a pro-democracy ""Lennon Wall"" of stickers and posters in the Tseung Kwan O area of Hong Kong after a discussion over current affairs, the South China Morning Post (SCMP) reports.
The discussion, inside a pedestrian tunnel used by protesters to leave messages of support for each other, became heated in August last year.
Hung had felt angry when he passed the wall and saw people putting up posters, as he had been out of work for about two months and believed these were the people who had caused the economic downturn, the website reports.
His lawyer told the judge his income as a tour guide had been badly affected by the protest movement, Radio Television Hong Kong reports.
Judge Kwok Wai-kin agreed during sentencing on Friday that the anti-government protesters had been ""like an army"", beating people up and blocking roads.
He said protesters who hurt ordinary people while pursuing their cause were no different from terrorists, according to local media reports.
Their extremist conduct was reminiscent of that seen during the Cultural Revolution, the judge is quoted as saying.
The Cultural Revolution, a campaign launched by then-leader Mao Zedong to get rid of his rivals, led to massive social, economic and political upheaval in China. Millions are thought to have died.
Hung pleaded guilty in December to three counts of wounding with intent, and apologised to his victims and the people of Hong Kong.
The judge described Hung as ""an involuntary sacrifice and a bloodstained victim hanging by his last breath"" as the protesters had ""ruthlessly trampled on his right to work, live and survive"", according to the SCMP.
Lennon Walls plastered with colourful notes spread across Hong Kong during the protests. They got their name from a wall in Prague that was filled with John Lennon-inspired graffiti after the singer-songwriter's death in 1980.
The territory saw weeks of protests over a proposal to allow suspects in the city to be extradited to mainland China.
While that was later abandoned, the protests morphed into demands for greater democracy and less control from Beijing, and anger against the government remains.
As a former British colony, Hong Kong is part of China but run under a ""one country, two systems"" arrangement that guarantees it a high level of autonomy, except in foreign affairs and defence."

It used to be that the German Energiewende (transition to renewable energies) once enjoyed overwhelming support among the population. However, a recent national survey conducted by Germany’s University of Stuttgart, in cooperation with the University of Münster and two Fraunhofer institutes, shows a nation that has become split over the bold project.
Only 29% of those surveyed now see themselves as supporters of the Energiewende.
A total of 2009 persons were surveyed by telephone on a variety of aspects concerning perception of the Energiewende, e.g. wind parks in the countryside, in coastal areas and offshore, solar energy and grid revamping. Scientists at the Zentrum für Interdisziplinäre Risiko- und Innovationsforschung (Center for Interdisciplenary Risks and Innovation Research) at the University of Stuttgart (ZIRIUS), the University of Münster and two Fraunhofer institutes for System and Innovation Research (ISI) and for Solar Energy Systems (ISE) reached the following results:
29 percent of the German population are classified as supporters of the Energiewende. Another 29 percent are ambivalent with regards to the Energiewende and the related technologies, and thus are viewed as being undecided, while 27 percent can be classified as critics of the Energiewende.

This is a far cry from overwhelming support and shows growing disenchantment with the transformation. What should be worrisome is that the big brunt of the costs have yet to hit.
Already 29 percent of those surveyed said that they are no longer willing to accept to pay more for electricity in order contribute to the success of the Energiewende, the survey found. Less than half, 47 percent, of German citizens say they are willing to pay 50 euros per year more for helping the Energiewende to succeed. That figure, the study notes,  is only under the condition that the total costs of the Energiewende get shared fairly between industry and the citizenry, and among the citizenry itself.
Trust in the main players of the Energiewende (large energy companies and utilities) and fairness are the most important factors in realizing acceptance. Refusal to pay or non-acceptance are not irrational defensive reactions, the study finds, but rather are based on sound reasons.

"According to experts, today’s global agriculture system faces a crisis. Intensive farming with heavy ploughing machinery is causing soil to be lost up to 100 times faster than it is formed – and valuable stored carbon with it too. The soil that remains is becoming depleted of nutrients, thanks to repeated cultivation of the same staple crops without respite. To delay the consequences of this “cereal abuse” and soup up crop yields, farmers artificially fertilise soils with synthetic nitrogen, typically made using natural gas or coal. This, combined with methane released by cattle and the loss of stored carbon from deforestation for agriculture, means that a quarter of all planet-heating gases come from how we feed the world. These gases are bringing weather patterns so extreme that some experts believe multiple crop failures and food system collapse could be a possibility in as little as a decade. Agriculture is eroding wildlife too. Run-off of fertilisers is causing dead zones in downstream rivers and oceans. Pesticides and the conversion of wild habitats to farmland are harming the insects that pollinate crops, and the plants they rely on to thrive. To top it all off, by the middle of the century there are expected to be a quarter more mouths on the planet to feed. By that point, the global food system is predicted to cause the planet to exceed key environmental limits that define a safe operating space for humanity. The future of food, then, may sound rather bleak. But it doesn’t have to be this way. With drastic changes, the food system could help solve environmental challenges and support human wellbeing. The question is how to bring about this future – and there are some radically different suggestions out there. In this sixth issue of Imagine, academic experts explore the competing visions on offer, and assess what needs to be done to create a food system that feeds the world and heals it too. The “green revolution” that produced a fourfold increase in global food production since the middle of the 20th century relied on pesticides, fertilisers, machinery, and monocultures. What should the next agricultural revolution hold? What is Imagine? Imagine is a newsletter from The Conversation that presents a vision of a world acting on climate change. Drawing on the collective wisdom of academics in fields from anthropology and zoology to technology and psychology, it investigates the many ways life on Earth could be made fairer and more fulfilling by taking radical action on climate change. You are currently reading the web version of the newsletter. Here’s the more elegant email-optimised version subscribers receive. To get Imagine delivered straight to your inbox, subscribe now. According to some, a technological revolution that could solve the food crisis is already underway. In this imagined future, next generation biotechnologies will re-engineer plants and animals. Global food systems will rely on smart robots, blockchain technology and the Internet of Things to manufacture synthetic foods for personalised nutrition. Nanotechnology will maximise the efficiency of fertilisers and pesticides, and improve gene-editing to create crops resistant to the impacts of extreme weather. One techno-fix in particular lights up the night sky with a bright pink glow: vertical farms. They use high-tech lighting and carefully control the indoor climate to bypass the constraints of Earth’s natural cycles to grow crops 24 hours a day, all year round. Because they recycle water that evaporates from the plants, these closed systems use as little as one-twentieth the water of traditional farms. Most don’t need soil either, because they dispense nutrients via mist or water. They’re at much lower risk of crop loss from contamination, pests, and storms, too. And because they can be placed on unproductive and urban land, they can decrease food miles and provide local produce to city dwellers. According to expert in food security Asaf Tzachor, they can even help save rainforests. He went to investigate a cutting-edge indoor farm project in Iceland’s Hellisheidi geothermal park. It closely regulates temperature, lighting, nutrient concentrations, and harvest timing to grow not crops, but plant microorganisms. Using this technique, the project’s photo-bioreactors can produce microalgae with similar nutritional content to soybeans at less than 0.6% of the land and water use. This is important because soy cultivation for animal feed is a leading cause of deforestation in the Amazon basin. And thanks to projected rapid growth in both world population and in the meat-eating global middle class, demand for soybean is set to grow 80% by 2050 – more than any other staple crop.

 The trouble is that these technologies often require vast amounts of energy and resources to produce and maintain. As sustainable design researcher at Queen’s University Belfast Andrew Jenkins argues, why ramp up power demand at a time of climate crisis, only to replace what the Sun gives us for free?

      Micro-naps for plants: Flicking the lights on and off can save energy without hurting indoor agriculture harvests


 For agricultural ecologist Michel Pimbert and food systems expert Colin Anderson, both at Coventry University, there are deeper problems with a high-tech agricultural future. They argue that it would: reinforce the concentration of political and economic power in the hands of a small number of corporations, such as the World Economic Forum’s “Transformative Twelve”; technologies that intend to redesign food systems, but are already under growing monopoly control further increase the role that financial markets play in controlling food systems, risking the repeat of earlier food crises result in an increasingly nature-less and people-less food system. As they put it: Flying robots will pollinate crops instead of living bees. Automated machines will replace farmers’ work on soil preparation, seeding, weeding, fertility, pest control and harvesting of crops.

      Techno-fix futures will only accelerate climate chaos – don't believe the hype


 Agroecology – a system of farming that uses or mimics natural interactions between organisms and their environments – has been highlighted as the most promising pathway to sustainable food by several UN reports. According to Karen Rial-Lovera, a senior lecturer in agriculture at Nottingham Trent University, agroecologists promotes circular systems for growing food that: improve soil quality by planting nutrient-fixing “cover crops” in between harvest crops, rotating crops across fields each season, and composting organic waste – often including human manure support wildlife, store carbon, and conserve water through the planting of trees and wildflower banks control pests and diseases by harnessing natural repellents and traps. Peppermint, for example, disgusts the flea beetle, a scourge to oilseed rape farmers.

      Three ways farms of the future can feed the planet and heal it too


 As Pimbert and Anderson explain, agroecology can also help break monopoly power over food systems and return control over the way food is produced, traded and consumed to communities. The system’s short food chains and local markets reduce the dependence of farmers on expensive external inputs, distant commodity markets and patented technologies. Research and innovations in agroecology are also being driven largely from the bottom up by civil society, social movements and allied researchers. Pimbert and Anderson argue that this offers hope that the system can regenerate not just local ecologies, but local economies and livelihoods too, increasing the income, working conditions, skills and political capital of small-scale farmers. They believe that, compared to technology-dependent visions of agriculture, it’s much more likely to nourish communities in a fair, ecologically regenerative, and culturally rich way. Many agroecological practices are nothing new. As Anna Krzywoszynska – associate director of the University of Sheffield’s Institute for Sustainable Food – explains, while limited soil fertility can now be bypassed with fossil fuel-derived fertilisers, for most of human history, using the local environment and labour to maintain soils in a good state was key to survival.

      IPCC's land report shows the problem with farming based around oil, not soil


 There are plenty of success stories from ancient civilisations that managed to do just that with rather simple means. Kelly Reed, an archaeobotanist at the University of Oxford, thinks we could learn a thing or two from them when building a sustainable future for food. She shares how in southern China, farmers add fish to their rice paddy fields in a method that dates back 2,000 years.  The fish are an additional protein source, so the system produces more food than rice farming alone. They also provide a natural pest control by eating weeds and harmful pests such as the rice planthopper. Compared to fields that only grow rice, rice-fish farming increases rice yields by up to 20%, while using less of the agricultural chemicals that pollute water and generate greenhouse gases. But according to Reed this practice, like many others with ancient history, is a dying art. Today, smallholder rice-fish paddies are increasingly being pushed out by larger commercial organisations wishing to expand monoculture rice or fish farms.  But research suggests it’s not too late to reorient farms around age-old wisdom and natural solutions. At least 75% of the world’s 1.5 billion smallholder farmers still practise agroecological techniques today. Most of these are in emerging economies such as Brazil, India, China and South Africa – countries in which industrial agriculture also occupies a growing share of land. Boosting small-scale farming is particularly important for such countries, say University of Cape Town’s Rachel Wynberg and Stellenbosch University’s Laura Pereira, both experts in agricultural transformations. They argue that these emerging economies could and should invest heavily in agroecological research and training programmes, especially where resources are scarce. If they do, they could avoid having to depend on technology and monopolies for food security, improve the livelihoods of small-scale, resource-poor and often marginalised farmers, and address the environmental damage wrought by industrial agriculture at the same time.

 Nature-inspired agriculture can also play an important role in tackling the climate crisis – and not just from using less fertiliser.  Healthy peatlands contain more carbon than all the world’s vegetation combined, but the vast majority of them throughout Europe and much of the world have been drained and converted into farm fields. The drained peat soils that stand in their place emit vast quantities of carbon dioxide – the total emitted each year from just the UK’s East Anglian Fens and damaged upland peat soils may be equivalent to around 30% of the country’s annual car emissions. This widespread draining is largely owed to the fact that our agricultural system spread from the dry semi-desert conditions of the Middle East during the shift from hunter-gathering to settled farming. This means that farming has been dominated for the past 5,000 years by the principle that dry land is good and wet land is bad. Peatland conservationist Richard Lindsay wants to change farming’s celebration of dryness. He says that wetlands can provide highly productive new forms of farming that not only grow crops, but also reduce the risk of floods and add to rather than deplete reservoirs of soil carbon. In Germany, for instance, a type of “bulrush” is already being grown on wetlands and used to produce fire-resistant building board. At the University of East London, Lindsay is testing two potential crops: sphagnum bog moss as a replacement for peat in garden-centre “grow bags”, and “sweet grass” as a food crop.

      Carbon farming: how agriculture can both feed people and fight climate change


 In the future then, many farmers could be cultivating carbon as well as crops. Here’s a vision for what life could be like for a “carbon farmer” three or four generations from now: It’s impossible to discuss farming and the climate crisis without mentioning animal agriculture. The livestock industry alone accounts for about 15% of global emissions. But, according to Rial-Lovera, that doesn’t mean it should be done away with entirely. Rial-Lovera outlines how carefully managed grazing can actually help the environment, not harm it. Grassland captures carbon dioxide. Animals eat the grass, and then return that carbon to the soil as excrement. The nutrients in the excrement and the continuous grazing of grass both help new grass roots to grow, increasing the capacity of the land to capture carbon. Keep too many grazing animals in one place for too long and they eat too much grass and produce too much excrement for the soil to absorb, meaning carbon is lost to the atmosphere. But if small numbers are constantly rotated into different fields, the soil can store enough extra carbon to counterbalance the extra methane emitted by the digestive rumblings of livestock. Ian Lunt – associate professor of vegetation ecology and management at Charles Sturt University in Australia – insists that livestock bring other benefits to the land too. They keep soil naturally fertilised, and can also improve biodiversity by eating more aggressively competitive plants, allowing others to grow. And if local breeds are adopted, they generally don’t require expensive feed and veterinary care, as they’re adapted to local conditions. University of California animal biotechnologist Alison Van Eenannaam argues that this is a much more environmentally friendly way of producing meat than lab-grown equivalents. She writes: Nature has already developed a fully functional biological fermentation bioreactor for the conversion of inedible solar-powered cellulosic material, such as grass, into high-quality protein. It is called a cow.

 But the global livestock population will still need to fall drastically if agriculture is to stem rather than accelerate global heating. In the UK at least, this transition can bring multiple environmental benefits without compromising the livelihoods of livestock farmers, says the University of St Andrews’ Ian Boyd. Around 20% of the UK’s farms account for 80% of the country’s total food production, and they do this on about half of all the farmed land there is. At least 80% of farms in the UK don’t produce very much at all, and rely heavily on government subsidies to stay viable. Livestock farms are the least profitable of all, yet they take up 45% of the UK’s land surface. Instead of propping up unproductive crop and grazing land, subsidies could instead task farmers with rewilding their land to forest or other habitats that can lock away CO₂ and expand habitats for wildlife, says Boyd. Farmers could also be rewarded for opening land near urban areas for public access, creating places of recreation that support human wellbeing. This would free up not only grazing land, but vast swathes of land currently used to grow animal feed. The livestock industry is an inefficient use of land – only 10-20% of the vegetable matter fed to livestock is converted into meat. Around 75% of the calories fed to livestock in the UK comes from land that could produce human food, or be rewilded, says Boyd.

 Of course, this would mean us all eating much less meat. Bringing people on board with this might seem like an impossible task. But Paul Young, associate professor of Victorian literature and culture at the University of Exeter, shows us that meat-eating habits are more malleable than we might think. In 19th-century Britain, a fast increasing population caused a mid-Victorian “meat famine”. To stave it off, groundbreaking preservation and transportation technologies were developed that enabled the British to eat livestock reared in the Americas and Australasia. This laid the foundations for the global meat markets that support the overproduction and consumption of meat today. Mass marketing campaigns alongside positive media coverage also helped promote these new forms of meat, until they became seen as an essential part of everyday meals for all. As a result, per capita meat consumption rose by nearly half between the 1850s and the 1910s, despite the fact that Britain’s population nearly doubled during this period. The globalisation of Victorian meat eating was revolutionary, but it was also highly controversial. Many were wary of eating long-dead animals from far flung parts of the world. Overseas competition provoked demands to protect British agriculture, both to preserve traditional ways of life and to guarantee food security. Animal rights campaigners too were concerned at the increasingly intensive farming methods and assembly line slaughter techniques associated with developing meat markets.

      The Victorians caused the meat eating crisis the world faces today – but they might help us solve it


 For Young, this Victorian history shows that hundreds of millions of people eat meat in the way and the quantities they do, not because they’re inherently designed to do so, but because of a global system set in motion by British imperial power. Not so long ago, the prospect of eating frozen lamb from the other side of the world provoked scepticism and disgust.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhen it comes to the treatment and handling of refugees, it turns out that European leaders are the very last people who should be preaching morality to President Trump. Their total incompetence have cost thousands of refugee lives, and the situation is only getting much worse. They own it.

Whopping 15,000 refugees have perished since 2009
The truth is that Europe’s handling of refugees coming from North Africa and the Middle East is a disaster of colossal dimensions. Since 2009, approximately 15,000 refugees have perished in the Mediterranean, right at Europe’s very doorstep.
Anger aimed at delays at JFK airport
Yet, Europe’s and America’s mainstream media, politicians and the hodge-podge of Soros-funded protest groups remain completely oblivious to this historic tragedy. Instead they are now rushing to condemn President Trump and his executive order, and expressing “outrage” over a few dozen refugees being held up inside an airport for a few hours.
What could Trump possibly learn from Europe on how to handle refugees?
The answer is absolutely nothing…unless he is looking for a case study on how to drown thousands of them each and every year. When it comes to “welcoming” refugees, Europe’s approach has been lethal and bungled like nothing we have ever seen.
Refugee crisis exploded after Obama/Europe meddled
Looking at the annual refugee deaths on the Mediterranean since 1990, the number each year until 2012 stayed relatively low, fluctuating at around 100 deaths each year. However, starting in 2013, just after the start of the Arab Spring, the Libyan Civil War, the Syrian Civil War (all orchestrated with the direct involvement of the US government and Europe), and the US withdrawal from Iraq, refugee deaths in the Mediterranean surged to 477 for the year — all without a finger of protest from activists.

From 1990 – 2013, a total of 3188 refugees died trying to reach Europe. With the beginning of Obama’s 2nd term, the number exploded. Source: borderdeaths.org.
More than ten-fold jump, to 3500 drownings
In 2014 the number jumped more than ten-fold, with over 3500 deaths of migrants/refugees crossing the Mediterranean being reported, according to the UNHCR.

Europe allows 15,000 refugee deaths at its door
The death toll then climbed to a new record in 2015, to 3735, and then surged again to more than 5000 last year (2016).
Since the Obama/Europe-supported Arab Spring began in 2009, approximately 15,000 refugees have died trying to reach Europe over the Mediterranean. Europe has let it all happen.
Ignored and dithered
European leaders were well aware of the crisis long ago, yet did little to effectively respond to it — seemingly hoping the situation would somehow just go away on its own. Few, if any, efforts were undertaken to make passage for the refugees safer. Instead European politicians dithered and fell over themselves like pigs on a skating rink.
A system to better ensure safe passage of the refugees never got set up. The sinkings and drownings continued by the hundreds. There were no angry protests aimed at governments to stop the carnage. Pleas for help from Italy, Greece and Turkey were played down or flat out ignored. Activists and leaders even tried to blame it all on “climate change”!
Recall: this is the very continent that today is expressing its outrage at President Trump, because a few dozen refugees got held up at a New York airport for a few hours.
It wasn’t until 2015, after hundreds of thousands of refugees had poured into Germany, did Angela Merkel and other European leaders move to take the refugee problem a bit more seriously — and it wasn’t because Merkel wanted to do so, but because she had been forced to do so. Europe had totally lost control of the refugee flow, which they themselves had initiated through their disastrous Middle East and North Africa destabilization rampage over the past years.
226 already drowned, froze to death, in first January fortnight
Now that 2016 has come to a close and the first month of 2017 is behind us, one could expect Europe to have perhaps gained some degree of control over the disaster by now. Unfortunately you would be very wrong to think so. Europe’s refugee catastrophe has in fact worsened and become the shame of the world.
According to The Independent, already more than 200 migrants have drowned and froze to death in the first half of January 2017 alone. According to the Independent:
At least 226 asylum seekers have lost their lives attempting to reach Europe so far this year – more than double the figure for the same period in 2016…”
My God, freezing to death in “compassionate and moral” Europe. This doesn’t deserve outrage and protest?
Despite all the charges and outrage launched at Trump, it is clear that it is in fact Europe that is totally incompetent and nowhere near a solution for the refugee crisis. Refugees keep drowning by the hundreds. They’ll never fix it.
This glaring incompetence is precisely why the European Union is being increasingly rejected, and why Donald Trump was elected. There is a growing sense that the ones who created the huge mess will only make it worse. It’s time for Europe to get out of the way and to work with Trump, and not against him, and to do so for the sake of thousands of future refugee lives.

Former Israeli foreign minister Tzipi Livni canceled a trip to Great Britain after an arrest warrant was issued for her role in “Operation Cast Lead” in the Gaza Strip. The British government apologized and announced plans to change its statute invoking universal jurisdiction, but London has failed to act on similar promises made in the past.



Britain is not alone in seeking to prosecute foreigners for actions committed in foreign lands. Canada, France, Germany, and Spain also claim the authority to jail most anyone for acts committed elsewhere. The practice is a dangerous assault both on national sovereignty and, individual justice.



Historically nations only exerted jurisdiction over people and events within their own borders. No matter how offensive the acts of others elsewhere, sovereignty simultaneously dictated and limited the reach of the law.





As long has been said, men of zeal can be the most threatening to people’s liberties.



While that meant some people escaped justice, it protected others from the politicization of the law. One could be held accountable in court only by the government to which one owed allegiance or which had jurisdiction where the alleged crimes occurred.



This traditional limitation on criminal prosecutions is under increasing attack. Transnational tribunals, such as those impaneled for the Balkans and Sierra Leone, have been created under the aegis of the United Nations. The International Criminal Court is a permanent body with jurisdiction over a number of offenses.



More disturbing is national “universal jurisdiction,” whereby individual countries assert authority to prosecute legal offenses irrespective of where they occurred. While originally focused on crimes against humanity, tax evasion, organized crime, and even environmental issues have been or could become subject to extraterritorial claims.



The Iraq war triggered multiple complaints against former president George W. Bush and leading figures in his administration. When then‐​Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld faced possible prosecution in Belgium, he threatened to move NATO’s headquarters, causing Brussels to scale back the law’s reach. But individuals and groups continue to push charges against former American officials elsewhere.



The premier symbol of this new form of “justice” is Judge Baltasar Garzon Real of Spain. A left‐​wing student activist in the waning days of the Franco dictatorship, he became the National Court’s youngest magistrate at age 32 in 1988. Called “super judge,” he has much greater power than in a country with common law, Anglo‐​Saxon legal tradition.



Explains Giles Tremlett of the _Observer_ : a typical investigating magistrate “does not conduct trials, but prepares them. He helps coordinate the policy enquiry, jails or bails suspects and, eventually, decides whether to bring charges.”



In 2006 Garzon declared: “We are all involved in the universe of human rights and obligations and that is why we all have the duty to find the appropriate solutions, so we can see improvements.” But his efforts more often yield publicity than convictions. 



“That desire to win spectacular cases — that is more powerful in him than any other motivation. He needs attention,” said Juan Alberto Belloch, a former Spanish justice minister.



No doubt, many of Garzon’s targets deserve prosecution for something by someone somewhere. But his campaigns have politicized the concept of justice and threatened the rule of law well beyond Spain’s boundaries. “Garzon is a pioneer,” opined colleague Lola Delgado. In the field of justice that should not be considered a compliment.



For instance, Garzon has declared that George Bush, former British premier Tony Blair, and Spanish prime minister Jose Maria Aznar should be prosecuted for the war in Iraq, “one of the most sordid and unjustifiable episodes in recent human history; a devastating attack on the rule of law.” In Garzon’s view, “There is enough of an argument in 650,000 deaths for this investigation to start without delay.”



In 2008 Garzon suggested that he would fight global warming by targeting major polluters. The same year he directed a conference at the University of Jaen which included a forum on climate change. His threat mimicked comments made by James Hansen of NASA, who accused major oil company executives of “a crime” in “putting out misinformation” on the topic. Hansen told Congress that “these CEOs should be tried for high crimes against humanity and nature.”



Also in 2008 Garzon issued an arrest warrant for Russian State Duma Deputy Vladislav Reznik for alleged connections to organized crime. Reznik’s residence on the island of Mallorca was raided and its contents seized. Reznik enjoyed immunity from prosecution in Russia as a member of the legislature.



In 2003 Garzon indicted Osama bin‐​Laden and 34 other alleged terrorists. They were charged not only for being members of a terrorist organization, but also for their role _in the 9/11 attacks in America_. Garzon explained: “We cannot fight a crime against humanity if we do not accept the priority of universal justice. It should be possible to pursue the authors of these acts anywhere in the world.”



While most Americans would like to bring in bin Laden dead or alive, the appropriate location of any trial and punishment would be the United States, where his most grievous crimes were committed. No wonder Carlos Taibo, a political science professor at Madrid’s Complutense University, observed: “The image that many jurists have of Garzon is that he is not very rigorous in the strictly legal sense.”



That is the definition of understatement.



Although 18 of the 24 defendants were convicted in 2005 of having terrorist links, the 9/11 counts fared less well. Only Eddin Barak Yarkas, al-Qaeda’s Spanish head, was convicted for allegedly conspiring to commit murder in the 9/11 attacks, and that conviction was later tossed out by the Spanish Supreme Court. Even the prosecutor acknowledged that while Yarkas might have been aware of the plot, “it is another thing altogether to say he planned it and assumed the conspiracy as his own.”



Garzon later attempted to extradite Omar Degayhes and Jamil al‐​Banna from the United States on the same charges, even though they then were incarcerated in Guantanamo Bay. They were released in December 2007 to Great Britain without charges, after which Garzon sought their extradition. Under strong criticism he dropped his efforts a few months later.



In 2002 Garzon requested that the British government allow him to question Henry Kissinger, who was visiting London, about “Operation Condor,” under which Latin American military dictatorships friendly to the U.S. eliminated political opponents. Garzon claimed that he wanted to interview Kissinger as a witness, not prosecute him as a defendant. The British government denied Garzon’s request.



Garzon sought to prosecute Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi in 2001 for allegedly evading taxes and violating limits on share ownership in a Spanish TV station, Telecinco. Garzon sought to convince the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe to lift Berlusconi’s immunity as member of that body. Spain’s highest court later cleared Berlusconi.



In 1999 Garzon issued warrants for 98 former Argentine military officers, including a dozen leaders of the junta, for murder and kidnapping, though Buenos Aires, which had enacted an amnesty for the accused officials, insisted that only Argentine courts had jurisdiction over such cases. Also indicted was Ricardo Miguel Cavallo, a Navy officer in charge of kidnapping and torture, who on a trip to Mexico was extradited to Spain at Garzon’s request.



In 1998, Garzon sought to extradite Chile’s then‐​Senator and former dictator Augusto Pinochet on a visit to London. Garzon charged Pinochet with the death of Spanish citizens in Chile. Garzon explained: the crimes involved “have no statute of limitations, their perpetrators cannot enjoy diplomatic immunity, nor can they obtain refugee status or be granted political asylum.” His request set off a lengthy legal battle that eventually reached the House of Lords. The British government released Pinochet in early 2000 on the grounds of poor health.



Also in 1998 Garzon arrested and charged Argentine Army officer Adolfo Scilingo, who had traveled to Spain voluntarily to testify, in the murder of political opponents of the ruling junta two decades before. Eight years later Scilingo was put on trial and convicted.



Although Judge Garzon is the most famous Spanish practitioner of extraterritoriality, he is not alone. In January 2009 Judge Eloy Velasco asserted jurisdiction over human rights abuses committed during the El Salvadoran civil war 20 years ago. Velasco opened an investigation into 14 ex‐​military personnel in the killing of several Jesuit priests and others.



While greatly expanding the reach of the law in his hands, Garzon criticized other countries for taking liberties with the law. In 2006 he urged the U.S. to close its prison at Guantanamo Bay: “A model like Guantanamo is an insult to countries that respect laws. It delegitimizes us. It is a place that needs to disappear immediately.”



Garzon naturally has won accolades from the human rights community, and many of the individuals he targeted richly deserve punishment. However, a promise not to prosecute may be the best, and sometimes only, means of peacefully ousting authoritarian regimes and maintaining social peace. That surely was the case in Garzon’s own Spain, with the passing of the Franco era.



Moreover, rules of justice are formulated to limit state abuse and protect the innocent. As long has been said, men of zeal can be the most threatening to people’s liberties.



It is worth remembering the famous scene in _A Man for All Seasons_ in which Thomas More rejects the willingness of his interlocutor, Thomas Roper, to cut down every law to get the Devil: “And when the last law was down, and the Devil turned ’round on you, where would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat? This country is planted thick with laws, from coast to coast, Man’s laws, not God’s! And if you cut them down, and you’re just the man to do it, do you really think you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then? Yes, I’d give the Devil benefit of law, for my own safety’s sake!”



Advocates of universal jurisdiction risk making the same mistake as Thomas Roper. Enthusiasts for arresting George Bush and others are many. But what is to stop the indictment of Barack Obama for “war crimes” in Afghanistan? And of Bill Clinton for committing military aggression against Serbia? Once loosed, the principle of universal jurisdiction is unlikely to be bound by any limits.

"A team of American chefs on Wednesday won the biennial Bocuse d’Or culinary competition  —   the equivalent of the Olympics for professional cooks  —   for the first time in the contest’s   history. In the finals in Lyon, France, a group of 10 chefs and helpers from the United States won the gold medal. Norway took the silver medal, and Iceland won the bronze. In 2015 an American team was awarded the silver medal in the competition, which was founded by the French chef Paul Bocuse. Teams from 24 countries competed this year. “I promised Monsieur Paul 10 years ago that we’d make it to the top of the podium,” said the chef Thomas Keller, who is the president of Team U. S. A. “We made it in nine. ” The team’s head chef was Mathew Peters, 33, from Meadville, Pa. who was most recently the executive   of Mr. Keller’s New York restaurant, Per Se. His commis, or helper, was Harrison Turone, 21, from Omaha, who also worked at Per Se. Both of the chefs took a year off to prepare for the contest, a fierce competition in which the American team is made up of younger chefs who can spare the time to train. Philip Tessier, a member of the team that won second place in 2015, was the Americans’ coach. This year the chefs were required to prepare a meat platter and a vegan dish in 5 hours 35 minutes. “We had to use two proteins, Bresse chicken and crayfish,” Mr. Peters said. “And this was the first year there was a vegan dish. ” The teams were required to interpret “Poulet de Bresse aux Écrevisses,” a Lyonnaise classic. The American version involved the chicken with morel mushroom sausage, braised wings, a wine glaze and sauce Américaine, a kind of lobster sauce. Alongside were a chicken liver quenelle with foie gras, corn custard,   peas and toasted pistachios, as well as lobster tail with Meyer lemon mousse. The garnishes included preparations using carrots, Vidalia onions, black truffles, carrots, peas and potatoes. They brought some of the ingredients from the United States. For the vegan dish, the chefs prepared California asparagus with cremini mushrooms, potatoes, a custard made of green almonds, Meyer lemon confit, a Bordelaise sauce and a crumble using an almond and vegetable yeast preparation that mimicked Parmesan cheese. The team arrived in Lyon 10 days ago. After the winners were announced at 7:25 p. m. local time, Mr. Peters, who had been cooking since 8:40 a. m. said his energy was starting to come back. An estimated 300 American supporters were in the hall to cheer the team. Unlike some teams, the Americans were supported only by commercial sponsors and contributions, with no government funding. “I don’t think our government knows who we are,” Mr. Keller said. Mr. Keller said he could not estimate how much participation in the contest cost. But he said that experience was essential. “We learned along the way,” he said. “Our win was built on the shoulders of a thousand people. ”"
"**Hong Kong has confirmed it has entered its first recession for a decade as it continues to be gripped by protests.**
Its economy shrank 3.2% in the July-to-September period compared with the prior quarter, figures showed, confirming earlier preliminary data.
It means the economy has contracted for two quarters in a row, which is the usual definition of a recession.
Tourists are staying away and shops are suffering amid battles between anti-government protesters and police.
""Domestic demand worsened significantly in the third quarter, as the local social incidents took a heavy toll on consumption-related activities and subdued economic prospects weighed on consumption and investment sentiment,"" the government said in a statement.
It now expects the economy to shrink 1.3% for the full year.
""Ending violence and restoring calm are pivotal to the recovery of the economy. The government will continue to closely monitor the situation and introduce measures as necessary to support enterprises and safeguard,"" the government added.
Hong Kong - a British colony until 1997 - is part of China under a model known as ""one country, two systems"".
Under this model, Hong Kong has a high degree of autonomy and people have freedoms unseen in mainland China.
The protests started in June after the government planned to pass a bill that would allow suspects to be extradited to mainland China.
Many feared this bill would undermine the city's freedoms and judicial independence.
The bill was eventually withdrawn but the protests continued, having evolved into a broader revolt against the police, and the way Hong Kong is administered by Beijing.
Protests have taken place every weekend over the past few months, causing widespread disruption and a number of deaths.
On Thursday, a 70-year-old cleaner died after he was hit in the head during a protest in the Hong Kong border town of Sheung Shui.
Video purported to be of the incident shows two groups throwing bricks at each other before the man falls to the ground after being struck on the head.
Dramatic scenes such as these have kept tourists away. In August, arrivals to the city - a popular travel destination and transit hub - hit their worst level since the SARS crisis of 2003.
Some hotels have slashed prices as they struggle to fill their rooms.
On Thursday, two companies with major operations in Hong Kong revealed the financial impact of the protests.
Luxury fashion house Burberry said its sales in Hong Kong had fallen by more than 10% and would ""remain under pressure"".
Airline Cathay Pacific cut its profit guidance and said the civil unrest had ""been exceptionally challenging, severely impacting demand and operations of the business"".
This week has seen a marked escalation in violence with intense street battles, violent clashes at universities and lunchtime protests in the financial heart of Hong Kong.
It is the first time in weeks that protests have taken place during weekdays.
Monday's protests followed a weekend of vigils and demonstrations after a 22-year-old student protester died last week.
Alex Chow had been in hospital since he fell from the ledge of a car park during a police operation a week ago.
Later on Monday, violence escalated further when a police officer shot an activist in the torso with a live bullet and a pro-government supporter was set on fire by protesters.
In London, Hong Kong's Justice Secretary Teresa Cheng was hurt after being jostled by anti-government protesters, the Chinese embassy said.
Ms Cheng is seen as having played a key role in promoting the unpopular extradition bill that triggered the protests. China strongly condemned the incident and called for a thorough investigation."
"With an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song on Tuesday,   Miranda moved one step closer to a rare artistic sweep: the EGOT. Only 12 other performers have held the title, which they earned by winning an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar and a Tony. (According to Vanity Fair, the acronym was coined in the 1980s by the “Miami Vice” actor Philip Michael Thomas, who has won none of the awards. It was repopularized by Tracy Morgan’s character on the sitcom “30 Rock. ”) Mr. Miranda’s Oscar nomination, his first, is for the song “How Far I’ll Go” from “Moana. ” It will compete against two songs from “La La Land,” one from “Trolls” and one from “Jim: The James Foley Story. ” If he wins, Mr. Miranda would join such performers as Helen Hayes, Audrey Hepburn, Whoopi Goldberg, Mel Brooks and Mike Nichols. The Tony Awards have been a stumbling block for many entertainers: Kate Winslet, Martin Scorsese, Randy Newman and, somehow, Julie Andrews, lack only Broadway’s highest honor. At 37, Mr. Miranda would be the youngest person to have won all four awards. His song, “How Far I’ll Go,” is a tribute to ambition and adventure, celebrating themes similar to one of Justin Hurwitz’s nominated songs, “Audition (The Fools Who Dream),” from “La La Land. ” “How Far I’ll Go” has been adapted into 44 languages, including a version sung by the Canadian pop star, Alessia Cara, on the film’s soundtrack. In a statement on Tuesday, Mr. Miranda thanked the academy and his collaborators on the film and congratulated all the nominees. “Future congratulations to the kids watching the telecast this year, singing along with their favorite songs, performing epic private concerts for the mirror with a comb or a toothbrush microphone,” he said. “You’re next. ” Last fall, when Mr. Miranda was asked about the possibility of winning all four awards, he pointed out that there were brilliant artists who had not won a single award. “There are great works of art that won nothing. And Vincent Van Gogh died penniless,” he said. “Awards are not a maker of excellence. ” “But they’re really cool,” the interviewer, from the awards news site Gold Derby, said. “They’re cool,” Mr. Miranda said. Mr. Miranda has two Grammys, one for the cast recording to his 2008 Broadway musical “In the Heights” and another for his smash hit “Hamilton. ” He has personally won three Tony awards (and his musicals have collected many more). He won an Emmy for his work on the music and lyrics at the 2013 Tony award show. It is, of course, an honor to collect all four awards  —   or even one of them. But the ambition to do so was mocked memorably on the “30 Rock” episode “Dealbreakers Talk Show #001,” in which Tracy Jordan, the character played by Tracy Morgan, decides that it is his dearest ambition to win all four awards, transforming the acronym into a verb: to EGOT. “That’s a good goal for a talented crazy person,” Mr. Morgan says. If he wins, Mr. Miranda will join an even more rarefied group: EGOT performers who also have Pulitzer Prizes. The composers Richard Rodgers and Marvin Hamlisch have won all five. Mr. Miranda, uniquely, has also received a MacArthur Fellowship."
"The common guillemot (known as the common murre in North America) breeds in both the Pacific and the Atlantic and is among the most abundant seabirds in the northern hemisphere. But like many other seabirds, its numbers have declined over the last few decades. Part of that decline is due to the marine environment – a seabird’s home and hunting ground – becoming increasingly unpredictable and difficult to survive in. Between the summer of 2015 and the spring of 2016, a marine heatwave swept the northern Pacific Ocean that was hotter and lasted longer than any since records began in 1870. Known as “the blob”, the heatwave caused sea surface temperatures along the Pacific coast of North America to rise by 1-2°C. That may sound trivial, but it was enough to cause massive disruption in the marine ecosystem. The fish that common guillemots normally eat, such as herring, sardine and anchovy, either died or moved into cooler waters elsewhere, leaving the guillemots with little to eat. As a result, many birds starved. A new study has revealed that one million common guillemots died due to the heatwave, and two thirds of them are thought to have been breeding adults. In a healthy population, about 95% of the breeding birds survive from one year to the next. But a bad year for adult survival causes big problems for the total population. This is because guillemots live up to 40 years and mature slowly, producing a single egg per annual clutch. A female may start breeding at the age of seven and continue to breed each year until she dies. Most seabirds live similar lives because the food on which they rear their offspring is often a long way from land. Ferrying food back to the breeding colony is what limits how many offspring they can rear in any one year. Rearing just a single chick at a time makes sense, but if many adult birds of reproductive age die, there are no new chicks to replace those birds that are lost, and so the population declines.

      Marine heatwaves are getting hotter, lasting longer and doing more damage


 Researchers based the estimate of one million dead guillemots on the numbers of dead or dying birds that washed up between California and the Gulf of Alaska. A total of 62,000 birds were found on 6,000km of coastline, but not all birds that die at sea end up on beaches. Previous studies have shown that the number of birds actually found dead needs to be multiplied by at least seven times – and possibly as much as several hundred times – to find the minimum estimate of the total numbers dead. That means that “one million dead seabirds” might actually be a conservative guess. According to the new study, breeding populations in the Gulf of Alaska suffered a 10-20% decrease in numbers. Complete breeding failure, where birds either failed to lay eggs or failed to rear any chicks, was reported at 22 regularly monitored guillemot colonies in Alaska during the breeding seasons of 2015, 2016 and 2017. Complete breeding failure is extremely unusual among guillemots and it’s a clear sign that food is in extremely short supply. The appearance of unusually high numbers of dead birds washed up on the shoreline is referred to as a “wreck”. Wrecks of common guillemots and related species such as puffins have been known about for many years. These population crashes may be a regular aspect of guillemot biology, but this one was far larger and over a much wider geographic area than any wreck seen before.  In most cases, wrecks are the result of persistent stormy conditions, disrupting the availability of fish on which seabirds like guillemots and puffins depend. When seas are rough and the weather harsh, the increased energy demands can kill many birds. The most recent wreck in the UK and western Europe occurred in the spring of 2014, and it killed at least 50,000 birds, mainly common guillemots and Atlantic puffins.

      Climate change is causing mass 'die-offs' in seabirds such as puffins


 The common guillemot populations in the Pacific and western Europe will probably recover from both of these recent wrecks, providing there’s no further turmoil, but there’s no room for complacency. The only way scientists will know if populations have recovered is by monitoring the birds. It’s an activity that is generally regarded as the lowest form of scientific endeavour, but one that’s absolutely vital in a world of declining wildlife. I’ve been studying and monitoring the number of common guillemots on Skomer Island, Wales since 1972. In that time, I’ve realised how essential this work is to understanding how guillemot populations work. Beach counts of dead seabirds allow scientists to detect unusual events, but these counts are meaningless without information on the overall size of the population. Without regular monitoring of seabird colonies on North America’s west coast, the researchers wouldn’t have known what proportion of the total population died, and would have missed the total breeding failures in the Alaskan colonies. The North Pacific common guillemot wreck was unprecedented for the sheer numbers of birds killed, and the vast region over which it occurred. But the marine heatwave that caused it may be just a taste of what is to come for seabirds around the world as climate change accelerates. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter.

"**Police in Hong Kong have arrested 15 of some of the city's most high-profile pro-democracy activists.**
The group includes 71-year-old media tycoon Jimmy Lai as well as a number of prominent lawmakers.
They are accused of organising, taking part in or publicising unauthorised assembles during last year's mass protests in the Chinese territory.
They are due to appear in court next month.
The government has not explained the high-profile arrests but they come days after Beijing's most senior official in the city called for a new security law to deal with dissent.
Before the coronavirus outbreak, Hong Kong had witnessed almost weekly demonstrations against a proposal to allow extraditions to the Chinese mainland.
While that was later abandoned, the protests morphed into demands for greater democracy and less control from Beijing, and anger against the government remains.
Media tycoon Jimmy Lai runs the Apple Daily newspaper, which is frequently critical of the Hong Kong and Chinese leadership.
Mr Lai, who was estimated by Forbes in 2009 to be worth $660m (Â£512m), was also arrested in February this year on charges of illegal assembly and intimidation.
Democratic Party founder and barrister Martin Lee, 81, was another prominent figure to be detained.
The 81-year-old - who is known as the father of Hong Kong democracy - said he was ""very much relieved"" by his arrest, according to AFP news agency.
""For so many years, so many months, so many good youngsters were arrested and charged, while I was not arrested. I feel sorry about it,"" he added."
"Construction and mining industry super fund Cbus says it will slash emissions from its investments by 45% within the next 10 years, putting carbon-intensive companies on notice that they will need to demonstrate how they will cut greenhouse gas emissions in order to stay within the fund’s $54bn portfolio. Cbus has also expanded an existing pledge to hit the Paris agreement target of zero emissions by 2050 in its property and infrastructure investments to cover its entire portfolio.  Its chief investment officer, Kristian Fok, stopped short of ruling out any investment in new thermal coalmining but said any such business would face an extremely high hurdle to attract Cbus’s money. “I’m not going to rule out anything, but the hurdles are going to be so high for these things, because the way we would see it is that it would have to be highly competitive against the alternatives,” he said. “Basically we now have a [carbon] budget in our portfolio, so it would have to be more compelling than something else.” He said Cbus had in the past been hesitant to make commitments outside property and infrastructure, where it has a voice at management level, because of a lack of data about emissions. “Frankly, as we’ve built our internal capability, we’ve built our confidence in understanding around this in all sectors,” he said. “And data is an issue, but we’ve sort of made the call that you can say that data is holding you back for only so long. “The reality is that things are coalescing fast around us. We have the reality that all states and territories in Australia have made commitments, for instance.” Institutional investors such as pension and superannuation funds have been ratcheting up the pressure on big emitters, such as mining companies, to slash their carbon output. In April, Norway’s US$1.1tn Government Pension Fund Global, one of the world’s biggest investors, put BHP on notice that it needed to get out of thermal coal or the fund would dump its stock in the company. At the same time, it announced it had sold its stake in Australian energy company AGL, which owns coal-fired power stations including the carbon-intensive Liddell plant in New South Wales. In August, UK government pension fund Nest sold off its last shares in BHP because the company’s carbon emissions were too high an investment risk. BHP has responded to shareholder pressure by abandoning its support for the use of carry-over credits to meet global greenhouse gas emissions targets and committing to selling or spinning-off its thermal coal assets, which include the Mount Arthur mine in NSW that powers AGL’s elderly Liddell power plant, within two years. One option open to BHP is giving the coal assets to existing shareholders by spinning the mines out into a separate company. Asked if Cbus would be willing to take shares in a BHP coal spin-off, Fok said the new framework wouldn’t stop the fund from doing so. “But what it does make us look very carefully at is what price we’re paying for it,” he said. “In relation to thermal coal, we would look at it in relation to the global economy. But it’s quite clear the lifecycle of thermal coal is shorter than the next fossil fuel, which is gas – but the lifecycle of gas is shorter than what it used to be as well.” He said the value of thermal coal assets was declining. “The whole industry itself is declining and will go away at some point in time, that is just the reality of this trajectory … so as an investor we need to understand that.” Cbus’s new emissions target will cover scope 1 emissions – produced by businesses themselves – and scope 2 emissions – those generated from the power used by businesses – but not scope 3 emissions, which are made by customers. Fok said it was currently too hard to measure scope 3 emissions “but ultimately we’re going to have to include scope 3”. “We will be committing to including scope 3 and including scope 3 over time,” he said. He said that even though many of Cbus’s members worked in high-emissions industries, they understood the need to decarbonise the economy. “When you dig down deep they actually understand the impacts of the climate. “One of the interesting things that one of our members said was of course we would be really cautious about building property right on the beachline, that would be ridiculous to do without thinking about the issues from rising sea levels. “And then they expect us to manage the risks and the opportunities in the portfolio in the same way.”"

The NY Times has [written about their policies for journalists and editors covering impartiality and politics](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/reader-center/political-impartiality.html). It is pretty good even though it is laughable that out of all news outlets it is the NY Times pretending to be impartial on anything.



One key area that perhaps the bosses at Red Radio might like to insist on is that “newsroom staff members may not participate in political advocacy, like volunteering for candidates’ campaigns or making contributions”. Though if they did follow that, their news bulletins might be a bit thin.



As New York Times employees, we are required to extend this self-scrutiny beyond our work, to the places where our personal and public lives intersect. **Newsroom staff members may not participate in political advocacy, like volunteering for candidates’ campaigns or making contributions.**



“And, by extension, we ask them to be very careful and mindful about other contributions and donations they make and volunteer work they do,” Philip B. Corbett, The Times’s standards editor, explains.



 **We should[not wear](https://www.nytimes.com/editorial-standards/ethical-journalism.html#participationInPublicLife) campaign buttons or display any other insignia of partisan politics, such as bumper stickers or lawn signs. Nor may we serve on government boards or run for public office.**



This goes for reporters, editors, photographers, artists, designers, researchers and other staff members in every news department of The Times, **not just for those who cover politics.**



 _Stuff_ too would be shot all to hell over those rules, especially their editor **Patrick Crewdson** with his [advocacy for climate change issues](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/stuff-editor-survives-irony-bypass-operation/). If only they could rise to the “standards” that the _NY Times_ professes to adhere to.



Next is a piece of advice for **Guyon Espiner** , **Matt Shand** , **Katie Bradford** and **Patrick Gower** from White House correspondent **Peter Baker** :



 **As reporters, our job is to observe, not participate** , and so to that end, I don’t belong to any political party, I don’t belong to any non-journalism organization, I don’t support any candidate, I don’t give money to interest groups and I don’t vote.



 **I try hard not to take strong positions on public issues even in private** , much to the frustration of friends and family. For me, **it’s easier to stay out of the fray if I never make up my mind, even in the privacy of the kitchen or the voting booth, that one candidate is better than another, that one side is right and the other wrong.**



I wonder how many of New Zealand’s news outlets have such a policy? Personally I’d prefer they didn’t pretend that they were impartial and just wore their colours proudly. That way we’d all know exactly where they stand.

"NEW DELHI  —   First, Yashpal Singh Rathore’s marriage was delayed by his future   who, like most Indians, ran short of cash after Prime Minister Narendra Modi banned the country’s largest currency notes in November. Then the    lost his job when the ensuing cash crunch hit demand for motorcycles and scooters sold by the company where he worked, Hero MotoCorp Ltd. After that, the prospective   refused to let the wedding go forward until he found another job. “So I lost my job and I lost my marriage,” he said in an interview at a protest, where he shouted slogans with more than 100    workers let go by Hero. Mr. Rathore is one among a large number of Indians  —   the precise number is not known  —   who have lost their jobs since Nov. 8, when Mr. Modi abruptly banned 86 percent of the country’s currency in a bid to eliminate “black money,” currency on which taxes had not been paid. For the sake of secrecy, the government largely avoided printing replacement notes in advance. So there has been an acute and protracted shortage of cash as the government struggles to catch up. That, in turn, has proved economically damaging. Exactly how harmful remains hard to determine, but the available data is not reassuring. Demand for vegetables is declining because people don’t have the money to pay for them, for example, and some service industries are reporting steep job losses. The International Monetary Fund this month cut its projected growth rate for India by one percentage point for the current fiscal year, to 6. 6 percent. While the full impact is still difficult to discern, there is little doubt who is suffering the most. “This has actually hurt the poor enormously,” said Nasser Munjee, chairman of DCB Bank and a company director at HDFC and Tata Motors. The pain is hidden, for the most part. Accustomed to hardship, many who lost employment were at first convinced by Mr. Modi’s speeches that their setbacks were transitory and, in the long run, would be worth the suffering. But as the crisis drags on, with no end in sight, some are growing frustrated, as they told us in a series of interviews at protests and at day labor gathering points. Many of them, even children, are forced to go without fruit, vegetables and milk  —   now unaffordable luxuries. Most had not paid apartment rents and their children’s school fees in the months since the cash ban. Many had sent their families back to their villages, and were ready to give up and follow if things did not turn around soon. Sending cash to the elderly parents they had long supported is now out of the question. As is common in India, the workers said that although they had worked on Hero MotoCorp’s shop floor, wearing company uniforms, they had been formally employed by other contractors, meaning they could be let go more easily without benefits. Sunil Kumar, 28, who had been earning 15, 000 rupees a month, about $220, at Hero, said he had been supporting his wife and two children when he lost his job without notice Nov. 29. They immediately cut milk, green vegetables and fruit from their diets, including for their    and    children. Paying rent is out of the question. “This is like a massacre for us,” he said. “My livelihood is gone after the cash ban. What do I do now?” The decline in vegetable demand is so steep that the prices of eggplants, potatoes, cauliflower and tomatoes dropped between 42 percent and 78 percent, the NCDEX Institute of Commodity Markets and Research said. In the first month alone after the currency ban, micro and   service industries cut staff by 35 percent, the All India Manufacturers’ Organization said, based on a survey. It released a study this month saying that job losses in a variety of industries, including automobile parts, infrastructure and construction, would swell to as much as 35 percent by March. The anecdotal evidence is painful. Mr. Rathore, whose wedding was postponed, is among 582 workers who reported losing their jobs at Hero MotoCorp in November and December, as the company suffered a 34 percent drop in   sales in December from a year earlier. Hero did not respond to requests for comment. Most economists believe the economy will rebound, but nobody knows how long it will take. In Noida, a satellite city of New Delhi, hundreds of unshaven men in rumpled clothing stood recently at a   intersection called Khoda Labor Chowk that is a gathering place for people seeking work. Before the currency ban, they told us, they would be hired most days, earning 400 to 600 rupees, about $6 to $9, for a day of carpentry, floor tiling or masonry. But since the ban, most interviewed said, they had worked for only a week each month, at best, and even on the few days when they were hired their wages had fallen by half. Rafiq Ali, 46, said that, having worked only 12 days in the last two months, he had sent his wife and two children back to his native village about 200 miles away, where it is cheaper to live. “I am surviving on roti and potato with salt,” Mr. Ali said, referring to the flat Indian bread that is a staple in the Indian diet. “I’ve stopped taking milk, even in tea, and eating vegetables. ” But what hurt him most, he said, was a recent call from his wife, back in the village, who wanted money to take their sick daughter to a doctor. Mr. Ali said he had nothing to send. “A sense of desperation and helplessness is emerging,” he said. “This currency ban is not helpful for poor people. ” Hoti Lal, a    father of three, said he could get work for only six days during the last two months, forcing his family to survive on money his    son made cleaning offices. Mr. Lal had hoped his son could give up that job to go to college, but that dream is fading fast. His son’s salary of 7, 000 rupees a month, a little over $100, is about half of what he used to earn regularly, Mr. Lal said. So, Mr. Lal said, his family has cut back entirely on green vegetables and milk. Almost every man we interviewed said he was a migrant who had been sending a portion of his salary home to support his parents in his native village  —   and had been unable to do so since the currency ban wiped out work. Vikas Sahu, 30, who had been working at Hero for four years, has been unable to send money back to his parents, wife and children, who live in his village about 100 miles west of New Delhi. His first grader’s school fees are overdue by months, and his father took out a loan of 70, 000 rupees, about $1, 000, for agricultural expenses, including paying for repairs on the family’s tractor. “How long I can survive like this?” he asked. With little else to do, Rakesh Yadav, 28, shows up most days to protest, hoping for some relief from the government or some upbeat economic news that might induce Hero to begin rehiring. He had worked there for eight years as a machine operator on the shop floor. To cut costs, his wife and daughter went home to his village. He gave up the one room they had shared at a monthly rental of 3, 300 rupees, or about $50, and moved in with four other men who share a room. “I do not know where to go or what to do,” he said. Mr. Rathore said he thought about giving up and returning to his village in Bilaspur district, about 750 miles south of Delhi, but he just cannot bear to do so, at least not yet. “What can I do in my village?” he asked."

"How much does generating electricity using renewables boost global warming? You’d probably think not at all, but according to a BBC article published in September 2019, emissions of sulfur hexafluoride (SF₆), “the most powerful greenhouse gas known to humanity”, have been rising rapidly in recent years, and the likely culprit is “the green energy boom”.  SF₆ gas is used to insulate electrical installations like wind turbines and was quoted as the industry’s “dirty secret” in the BBC article. The article also claimed that SF₆ emissions to the atmosphere in 2017 had the same warming effect as adding an extra 1.3 million cars to roads across the UK and the EU.

      Not so fast: why the electric vehicle revolution will bring problems of its own


 Since then, concerns about the climate impact of SF₆ have cropped up in a few different stories. The facts about SF₆ in these articles are mostly accurate, but in our view, they give the general impression that the environmental threat of rising SF₆ emissions is on an equal footing with carbon dioxide (CO₂). So, let’s set the record straight. SF₆ is a man-made, colourless, odourless gas and is indeed the strongest greenhouse gas in the Earth’s atmosphere. On a per molecule basis, SF₆ is approximately 23,500 times more effective at trapping heat than CO₂ and lasts in the atmosphere for about 1,300 years. SF₆ is an effective electrical insulator for circuit breakers and switches (collectively known as switchgear) and helps prevent accidents and fires. Switchgear is leaky and inevitably emits some SF₆ to the atmosphere.  Renewable energy installations require more switchgear in the electricity grid than fossil fuels, because it takes more solar panels and wind turbines to produce the same electrical output as a single coal power station. So as renewable power generation grows, emissions of SF₆ to the atmosphere should grow too. Measurements show that SF₆ has been increasing in the atmosphere. While SF₆ emissions across Europe have more than halved since the mid-1990s, global emissions are increasing, mostly owing to increases in SF₆ emissions from the electrical industry, which are predicted to continue. Even so, it’s important to put the role of SF₆ as a greenhouse gas into context with other greenhouse gases. The most important sentence in the BBC’s article is this: Concentrations in the atmosphere [of SF₆] are very small right now, just a fraction of the amount of CO₂ in the air. Unfortunately, this critical point isn’t developed. The global concentration of atmospheric CO₂ today is about 410 parts per million, whereas the global concentration of SF₆ is only about 10 parts per trillion. In other words, there is 41 million times more CO₂ in the atmosphere than SF₆. But since SF₆ is 23,500 times stronger at trapping heat than CO₂, doesn’t this still mean it’s a bigger problem than CO₂ for the climate? CO₂ is actually a very weak greenhouse gas and is much less efficient at trapping heat compared to other greenhouse gases, such as methane (CH₄) and nitrous oxide (N₂O). The reason why CO₂ has the largest impact on the climate is partly because, like SF₆, it is very long-lived. But mostly, it is because there is so much more CO₂ in the atmosphere than other greenhouse gases (except for water vapour, which is not the main driver of anthropogenic climate change because it is so short-lived). Scientists can compare the strength of different greenhouse gases using global warming potentials (GWPs). We say that SF₆ is 23,500 times stronger than CO₂ because this is the value of its GWP on a 100-year timescale, whereas CO₂ has a GWP of 1. So over 100 years, one molecule of SF₆ will have a similar warming effect as 23,500 molecules of CO₂.  But crucially, GWPs do not include any information about how much of a gas there is in the atmosphere. A crude way to assess the impact of each gas on the climate is to multiply the current atmospheric concentration by the GWP. While this approach is very simplistic, it’s still useful for putting the impact of SF₆ in context. The result looks like this. From the previous table, we can also say that every year the CO₂ humans add to the atmosphere has 350 times more warming impact than the SF₆ that’s added. Even if the global installed base of SF₆ increases by 75%, as stated by the BBC article, the impact on the climate will be very small compared to the impact from other greenhouse gas emissions.  SF₆ is a very powerful greenhouse gas and its long lifetime will mean that it affects the climate for thousands of years. Its emissions should be regulated and reduced, and governments should encourage the development of alternative electrical insulators to SF₆. It’s important to continue monitoring this gas in the atmosphere to ensure that strategies to reduce emissions are working, but the contribution of SF₆ to climate warming is a very small fraction (0.04%) and decarbonisation should remain the world’s key focus.  CO₂ emissions are still rising every year and if they don’t rapidly fall then limiting the global average temperature increase to 1.5℃, an international priority, could slip out of reach by 2027. In her 1993 Nobel Prize lecture, the writer Toni Morrison said that language is an act with consequences. Journalists know this: working with words is their trade. We feel that the BBC’s SF₆ article sowed unreasonable doubt about the overall climate benefits of renewable energy. In fact, the climate benefits arising from generating more renewable energy are clear and, in this case, we believe the BBC dangerously prioritised a catchy headline over content by neglecting to put the facts about SF₆ in context.

"As large swathes of the UK endure the worst floods in living memory, hearts and minds are rightly focused on protecting people and property. At one point the government’s Environment Agency had issued a record 594 flood warnings or alerts – its map of the country was a sea of orange and red symbols: Once the floods recede, there will doubtless be a period of reflection on what could have been done better. It may be tempting to point the finger of blame or to promote a particular solution. But the hard truth is that there is no silver bullet for “preventing” floods. There are common sense actions, like avoiding new development in places that are known to flood. Official statistics suggest that about 10% of new residential addresses are created in these high risk areas (classified as National Flood Zone 3). It is also smart to protect critical infrastructure like bridges or power substations to high standards. Yet a 2016 government review of flood resilience revealed more than 500 assets vulnerable to flooding.  Other measures can help ensure that floods, when they do occur, are less devastating. These include paved floors, valves to shut off foul water, or raising electrical circuits. Who should pay for these is another matter. However, we need to accept that the climate is changing, and with it the pattern and types of river flooding. For instance, the Met Office has charted a steady decline in the number and severity of substantial snowfall events since the 1960s. Less snow means subsequent spring melting is becoming rarer. Instead, the country is seeing more heavy rainfall, with winter records being broken on a regular basis.  Or consider how a warmer Atlantic boosted the intensity of Storm Desmond in December 2015 by 25%. Desmond set the UK’s 24hr rainfall record and caused severe flooding across much of northern England. These consequences are exactly what the climate models have been predicting for decades. The net result is more water flowing from the headwaters of rivers in shorter periods. We are also observing simultaneous flooding across many river basins on a regular basis – the period since the late 1990s has been especially flood-rich. We aren’t going to halt or reverse climate change anytime soon. However there are some technical solutions that might help reduce (note “reduce” not “prevent”) the risk of flooding. First, we will need to build new flood and coastal defences to higher standards to cope with climate change.   Second, we’ll need state-of-the art forecasts that can zoom right in and predict the risk of flooding from street to street. These next generation systems will warn at risk communities and businesses, and could help emergency services to navigate flooded road networks. But many, including the government, are now promoting the wider uptake of “natural” flood management. This refers to various techniques intended to retain water or slow it down, or store it in floodplains without causing harm.  Examples of natural flood management include: soil conservation, which means more water soaks into the ground rather than staying on the surface; adding large wood debris to river channels and building “leaky” dams to delay the flow from upland streams; wetland creation, urban ponds, and setback of flood embankments to make space to store excess water. There may also be wider environmental benefits such as tree planting, habitat creation or carbon sequestration in new forests and re-wetted uplands. This all sounds very appealing and is the subject of ongoing research. Unfortunately, when we worked on the most comprehensive meta-analysis of natural flood management to date we concluded that such techniques are useful for reducing nuisance floods but would be overwhelmed by the types of super-floods seen in the UK this winter.  Throw a month’s worth of rain on a saturated catchment in one weekend and no nature-based solution is going to hold back the water. Given large UK river basins generally host various buildings, roads, many different types of fields and so on, it is also impossible to detect exactly what portion of changes in observed flood risk can be attributed to a patchwork of leaky dams, soil conservation and so forth. This is also very difficult even within modelled worlds. We don’t want to discourage natural flood management, but we need more candour about its capabilities. Given the challenges posed by climate and landscape changes, we should be drawing on the full tool kit. Raising hopes of flood “prevention” by nature-based solutions will only lead to disappointment. They have a place, but only within a much broader, coordinated set of responses."
"

Sen. Sherrod Brown (D, OH), along with eight other ""usual suspects,"" yesterday sent a letter to Senators John Kerry (D, MA), Joe Lieberman (I, CT) and Lindsey Graham (R, SC), outlining what's necessary for their support of the latter's climate green jobs bill (there seems to be some confusion about the precise purpose). The math, assuming that Republicans vote as a block to defeat the bill, requires that these senators' demands be met if the Democrats are to overcome a filibuster and pass the bill.   
  
So what exactly do they want? The main thrust of their demands seems to be for U.S. manufacturing's competitiveness to be ""addressed,"" including by asking for the bill to ""invest"" (don't you just love the way that word is used in the public policy context?) in retooling, R&D, and ""support [for] American manufacturers of clean energy technology,"" among other requirements.   
  
Of course, no letter from these folks* would be complete without the obligatory calls for a ""level playing field."" Their wish-list therefore also includes provisions to ""apply border measures to prevent carbon leakage"". That, my friends, is a clear reference to carbon tariffs. The senators explain their concerns as follows: 



An automatically triggered border measure is necessary to promote comparable action from other countries and prevent carbon leakage. To avoid undermining the environmental objective of the climate legislation, a WTO-consistent border adjustment measure, which the WTO has recognized as a usable tool in combating climate change, should apply to imports from countries that do not have in place comparable greenhouse gas emissions reduction requirements to those adopted by the United States. A border adjustment measure is critical to ensuring that climate change legislation will be trade neutral and environmentally effective.



Much of these sentiments are familiar. Indeed, I have combatted some of the myths implicit in the statement, including why ""carbon leakage"" might be a bit of a red herring, in my paper from September 2009, ""A Harsh Climate for Trade,"" and at a Hill brief I gave on this topic last year.   




There are a couple of new and interesting things here, though. First, the almost convincing attempt by these senators to cloak their protectionism in green-speak about the need to ensure that climate legislation is environmentally effective. They will have to keep that up, too, if they are to stay on the right side of WTO law, which says there must be a clear link between a trade measure and an environmental purpose if the measure is to be at least _prima facie_ legitimate. Imposing border measures to address adverse competitiveness effects of domestic environmental regulations, in other words, probably won't cut it. (""A Harsh Climate"" has more on why unilateral border actions may in and of themselves be inconsistent with WTO obligations.)   
  
Second, and related to the issue of WTO legitimacy, is the reference to the WTO ""recogniz[ing]"" border adjustment measures as ""a useable tool in combating climate change."" This is disengenuous and possibly misleading rhetoric from the senators, because the WTO has done no such thing. There has been no formal ruling on this issue from any WTO judicial body, because no such cases have come before it. The WTO members as a group have not issued a proclaimation on it, either. I suspect the senators are referring to a joint WTO/United Nations Environment Programme report that came out last year, but as I said in my paper, that report ""merely summarizes the relevant provisions, precedents and existing literature on the question on WTO consistency--without reaching any prescriptive conclusion at all."" And the demand that this tool be ""automatically triggered"" may put it at odds with jurisprudence that says that certain administrative procedures--including the right for a WTO member to review and appeal any decisions made--must be followed (reference for the trade wonks reading this: I am referring to _Shrimp-Turtle_ ).   
  
In sum, while the senators are at least trying to appear as if they give two straws about international obligations (and for small mercies we should be grateful, I guess), I'm not convinced they fully understand the implications of their proposal. Shocking, I know.

Icy ebb and flow influenced by hydrothermal activity
Release of magma from beneath earth’s crust plays significant role in earth’s climate
From the UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT
The last million years of Earth’s history was dominated by the cyclic advance and retreat of ice sheets over large swaths of North America. During cold glacial intervals, ice sheets reached as far south as Long Island and Indiana, while during warm interglacial periods the ice rapidly retreated to Greenland. It has long been known that ice ages occur every 40,000 years or so, but the cause of rapid transition between glacial and interglacial periods has remained a mystery.
While conventional wisdom says that this icy ebb and flow is an interaction between the world’s oceans, the ice itself, and the earth’s atmosphere, an article appearing in the Jan. 28, 2016 issue of the journal Science sheds new light on the role that the earth itself may play in this climatological ballet.
David Lund of the Department of Marine Sciences at the University of Connecticut and his colleagues have studied hydrothermal activity along the mid-ocean ridge system — the longest mountain range in the world which extends some 37,000 miles along the ocean floor. Their research suggests that the release of hot molten rock, or magma, from beneath the earth’s crust in response to changes in sea level plays a significant role in the earth’s climate. This change is attributed to the release of heat and carbon dioxide (CO2) into the deep ocean.
Lund says, “Mid-ocean range magmatism — the release of molten rock through volcanic vents or fissures — is driven by seafloor spreading and decompression melting of the upper mantle” — the partially molten layer just beneath the earth’s crust.
“This activity is controlled by the rate of pressure release at any given location. There’s clear evidence that when ice sheets grow, sea level lowers and significant pressure is taken off the ocean ridges. This causes melting in the mantle, which should in turn promote the release of heat and carbon into the oceans — and that’s when glacial termination begins — meaning the ice starts to melt. Then, sea levels begin to rise, pressure on the ridges increases, and magmatic activity decreases.”
Well-documented sedimentary records from the East Pacific Rise (EPR) — a mid-ocean ridge extending roughly from Antarctica to the Gulf of California — show evidence of enhanced hydrothermal activity during the last two glacial terminations, the last of which took place about 15,000 years ago.
According to Lund, the southern East Pacific rise (SEPR) has the fastest spreading rate and the highest magmatic budget of any ridge in the global mid-ocean ridge system. Due to its elevated magmatism, the SEPR has over 50 known active vent sites.
He says, “The coincidence in timing between hydrothermal maxima and glacial terminations implies that there may be a direct causal relationship between hydrothermal activity and deglaciation … Our results support the hypothesis that enhanced ridge magmatism, hydrothermal output, and perhaps mantle CO2 flux acts as a negative feedback on ice-sheet size … ”
In this study, core samples from both sides of the ridge axis were analyzed and included radiocarbon and oxygen isotopic analyses of microscopic shells to provide age control for each core. Major and trace element concentrations were determined using x-ray florescence and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.
The EPR results establish the timing of hydrothermal anomalies, an essential prerequisite for determining whether ridge magmatism can act as a negative feedback on ice-sheet size.

[Update by Willis] The underlying paper in Science magazine, “Enhanced East Pacific Rise hydrothermal activity during the last two glacial terminations”, is paywalled here. From the magazine:
Searching sediment for climate signals
Sediments on the ocean floor may provide clues about the interplay between ice ages and mid-ocean ridge magma production. Lund et al. present well-dated and detailed sediment records from hydrothermal activity along the East Pacific Rise. The sediments show changes in metal fluxes that are tied to the past two glaciations. Ice age changes in sea level alter magma production, which is manifested by changes in hydrothermal systems. The apparent increase in hydrothermal activity at the East Pacific Rise around the past two glacial terminations suggests some role in moderating the size of ice sheets.
Science, this issue p. 478
Abstract
Mid-ocean ridge magmatism is driven by seafloor spreading and decompression melting of the upper mantle. Melt production is apparently modulated by glacial-interglacial changes in sea level, raising the possibility that magmatic flux acts as a negative feedback on ice-sheet size. The timing of melt variability is poorly constrained, however, precluding a clear link between ridge magmatism and Pleistocene climate transitions. Here we present well-dated sedimentary records from the East Pacific Rise that show evidence of enhanced hydrothermal activity during the last two glacial terminations. We suggest that glacial maxima and lowering of sea level caused anomalous melting in the upper mantle and that the subsequent magmatic anomalies promoted deglaciation through the release of mantle heat and carbon at mid-ocean ridges.
And here is one of their figures, with the original caption:

Normalized metal fluxes at 11°S compared with EPR bathymetry.
The hydrothermal time series are from the eastern (magenta) and western (black) flanks of the EPR and include (A) Fe flux, (B) Mn flux, and (C) As flux. We normalized each record by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of each time series to facilitate comparison between cores with different mean metal concentrations. The results include both discrete samples (thin lines) and time series smoothed with a 20-ky-wide Gaussian window (thick lines) to approximate the resolution of the bathymetry compilation at 17°S (gray lines) (4). Fluxes from 0 to 40 ky are based on the results from Fig. 2; the interval from 40 to 200 ky B.P. is based on results shown in Fig. 3.

"We’re resurfacing this article in light of President Trump’s recent comments on Nafta. After calling it the “worst trade deal,” he seems to be softening his stance.  It was a deal that created a deeply intertwined economy stretching from the Arctic to Central America and a generation of mostly warm relations between the United States and its two neighbors. It has also contributed to the loss of manufacturing jobs in the United States and added to   discontent in the communities that lost them. That, in turn, helped propel a sharp critic of the deal to the White House. So with Donald J. Trump in charge, what happens now to the North American Free Trade Agreement? It’s one thing to assail it as the “worst trade deal ever” as the president did during the campaign. It’s quite another to come up with an arrangement that is more advantageous to American workers and businesses. “Nafta is logically the first thing for us to deal with,” said Wilbur Ross, the president’s nominee to be commerce secretary, in his confirmation hearing. It will be, he said, a “very, very early topic in the administration. ” So what might that actually mean? What can the president actually do, what benefits might be attained for the United States and what could go wrong? Trade experts say there really is room to make major change in the    agreement. A renegotiation could well lead to a better deal for all three countries. But it will require the United States to make concessions that the Trump administration may be wary of offering. If not approached carefully, revamping an agreement that has created the economic underpinning of major industries would risk American jobs as well as higher prices for consumers. And the closer the Trump administration gets to blowing up the deal, the larger those risks loom. Before diving into what could go wrong  —   and right  —   as President Trump looks to rework Nafta, it’s worth starting with the basics. What is Nafta? On Oct. 7, 1992, President George H. W. Bush stood in San Antonio flanked by the president of Mexico and the prime minister of Canada. “This meeting marks a turning point in the history of our three countries,” he said. “We are creating the largest, richest and most productive market in the entire world. ” Mr. Bush’s successor, Bill Clinton, was the one to push the North American Free Trade Agreement through a divided Congress. By 1994, the three countries were entwined in a trade deal that, in its 22 chapters covering 309 pages, lashed their economies together. It eliminated most tariffs on goods traded between the nations, and set in place processes to get rid of regulatory and other barriers. The idea was that over time a company in Ohio could do business with a firm in Ontario as easily as it did with one in Indiana. What have been its results? As the election showed, whether Nafta was a good thing for voters in the United States or a bad one continues to be argued. But there are some things most people who study these things can agree upon. The North American economy really does work as an integrated whole. United States exports to Mexico, for example, are now 3. 5 times their 1993 level when adjusted for inflation. They have risen more than twice as fast as the overall economy. Trade between the United States and Canada has been pretty well balanced over time, but the United States has had about a $60 billion per year trade deficit with Mexico, importing more than it exports. In the auto industry, for example, supply chains crisscross North American borders, with work of different complexity done in different countries. Your Ford made in Michigan might contain a dashboard made in Juarez and a transmission made in Windsor, Ontario. This complex supply chain has helped make the U. S. auto industry competitive with manufacturers in Asia and Europe, which also contain both   and   countries with different specialties. The impact on jobs and incomes in the United States is less clear. Economists broadly supportive of free trade deals argue that Nafta essentially encouraged a shift of jobs in the United States toward   more productive work, raising wages and having negligible impact on the total number of jobs. Those more skeptical of the deal view it as having created   competition across the border in Mexico that accelerated the loss of manufacturing jobs. (See a more detailed explanation of the competing views here and here.) One way to reconcile those two views: Nafta may have increased overall G. D. P. and average incomes in the United States  —   but at the same time contributed to the decline in   U. S. manufacturing jobs that tended to be concentrated in certain cities and among certain groups of people, mostly   men. Can President Trump kill the deal? In theory, yes. But it would be a mess, particularly if he tried to do it right off the bat. Article 2205 of  Nafta says that a country can withdraw from the agreement six months after giving notice. But if President Trump did that, it would unleash disarray in major industries ruin the ability to have   negotiations with Canada and Mexico and most likely cause a legal showdown with Congress (which passed Nafta all those years ago and wouldn’t want it abrogated without a say). That doesn’t sound like what the Trump administration has cooked up. It’s more likely to reopen the deal. “I’m optimistic that we can renegotiate the deal that’s both advantageous to us and advantageous to Mexico, that’s a   for both countries,” said Steve Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary nominee, in his confirmation hearing. Will Canada and Mexico come to the table for a renegotiation? Sure looks that way. The White House has announced plans to meet separately with the leaders of both countries, and all signals are that they’re up for new talks. In the case of Mexico, President Enrique Peña Nieto has said he wants talks to cover a wider gamut than trade alone  —   implicitly threatening to become less cooperative on fighting drug trafficking and other frontiers if the Trump administration is excessively punitive in trade talks. And, of course, Mr. Trump’s announcement today that he will build a wall on the border  —   and that Mexico will eventually pay for it  —   could cause Mexico to rethink its outlook on trade negotiations altogether. So what is the United States going to ask for? We don’t know for sure, but some hints have emerged. One strong possibility would be to focus on “rules of origin” governing what counts as an automobile or other finished good produced within the free trade area. For example, a steering wheel might be assembled in Mexico but include parts made in China the rules of origin state how many of those parts can come from China while still counting as a Mexican steering wheel and thus enjoy the benefits of the free trade zone. If the required share of North American parts were increased  —   from its current 62. 5 percent for many auto parts to 75 percent, for example  —   it would give an advantage to manufacturers in the United States and reduce competition with the   countries of Asia. Another example of a possible United States priority: asking Canada and Mexico to be more liberal in allowing goods to be shipped into their countries with no taxes and little paperwork. (To be precise, asking them to raise the value of what would count as a “de minimus” shipment exempt from the usual customs process). That would be good news for American companies looking to sell into those countries. The United States has long complained that the tribunals that settle trade disputes among the three countries are stacked against U. S. interests, and it could seek changes. Those sure seem like perfectly normal things for trade deals to focus on. They are. But there was one more goal for the United States that Trump argued for during the campaign, and it would be a bigger source of friction if his negotiators chose to pursue it. Mr. Trump characterized the   tax that both Mexico and Canada have as unfair to U. S. companies. The tax is 16 percent in Mexico when a Mexican firm exports goods to the United States, it receives a rebate for the tax it paid, and when a U. S. firm exports to Mexico, a comparable adjustment is added. Mr. Ross, the Commerce secretary nominee, and Peter Navarro, a Trump White House trade adviser, argued in a white paper during the campaign that this amounts to an unfair export subsidy that penalizes the United States. Canada and Mexico aren’t likely to see it that way, and will resist if the United States seeks a change to the rules so that a VAT adjustment is no longer added to U. S. exports into their countries. In their view  —   and that of mainstream economists  —   their approach to taxing is the only way to avoid unfairly penalizing their domestic companies. The VAT is similar to a sales tax, and to the Mexican government, the Trump position will sound like the equivalent of Massachusetts demanding that it be able to sell its goods in Connecticut without a sales tax slapped on them. So if that issue ends up at the center of the negotiation, things could get rocky. But a deal should get done, right? Maybe. But keep in mind: This won’t be a   street. Both Canada and Mexico expect concessions from the United States in return for concessions they make. And some of the things that the Mexican government most covets will rankle many Trump supporters. For example, Mexico wants better access to a program, widely enjoyed at the Canadian border, in which shippers that pass a security review are allowed to cross the border with a less intensive customs process (this is the international trade equivalent of the “T. S. A. PreCheck” security line at the airport). Mexico also seeks more favorable treatment for Mexican citizens with advanced skills seeking visas to work temporarily in the United States. Needless to say, making it easier for Mexican trucks and Mexican workers to get into the United States isn’t exactly what Trump campaigned on. But that’s the kind of concession that may be needed to get a trade deal. Is there a chance Nafta completely blows up? There is  —   though not necessarily in catastrophic fashion. Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, lays out a possibility in which the Trump administration does eventually withdraw from Nafta, but in a context in which it has worked out separate deals with Mexico and Canada that maintain most of the trade arrangements codified in Nafta. President Trump and his advisers have often spoken of a preference for bilateral deals instead of big multicountry trade deals. It is potentially a pathway for Trump to be able to proclaim that he ended a trade deal he assailed on the campaign trail, without wrecking the economy. Even that wouldn’t necessarily be painless, however. “It would be like ” Mr. Hufbauer said. “There will be firms and communities in the U. S. that will be adversely affected, that will close down if you disrupt these supply chains. That won’t make for good newspaper coverage, and presumably the Trump team will want to avoid that. ” Just how urgent is renegotiating Nafta? Campaign promises aside, even some people who have been opposed to Nafta and other trade deals don’t view this as a   priority. U. S. trade with Canada is reasonably well balanced, and the trade deficit with Mexico is smaller than that with some giant Asian economies. Robert E. Scott, the director of trade and manufacturing policy at the liberal Economic Policy Institute, sees more to be gained by rethinking the trade relationship between the United States and China, Japan, South Korea and even Germany. “Those are accountable for 80 percent of   job losses over the last 20 years,” he said. “To me, Nafta is not a top priority. ” “There are much bigger fish to fry,” he added."
"How much of the Earth’s landmass is made of peat? We know that peatlands store as much as a quarter of all soil carbon, and if this were to be released we would face climate havoc. Until now, however, no one had made a comprehensive map of where peatlands occurred and how deep they were.  Gustaf Hugelius, from Stockholm University, and his colleagues analysed more than 7,000 cores drilled from peatlands in the northern hemisphere, measuring the depth of the peat and how much carbon and nitrogen it stored. Using machine-learning techniques, they extrapolated these measurements to create a comprehensive map of northern peatlands, showing that they cover about 1.4m sq miles (3.7m sq km). “If it were a country, ‘Peatland’ would be slightly larger than India,” writes Hugelius in the Conversation. Their calculations, published in PNAS, reveal the peatlands store approximately 415bn tonnes of carbon – as much as is stored in all the world’s trees together. Around half of peatland carbon is locked in permafrost, but global warming and permafrost thaw is likely to turn the peatlands into a carbon source within a few decades. The researchers show that limiting warming to less than 2C (3.6F) would be far less damaging than current trajectories of 3C (5.4F) or more."
"**Exchange students in Hong Kong have been flown back to the UK amid rising tensions between protesters and police.**
The University of Kent's Dean for Internationalisation met with those on their studies abroad last week.
Anthony Manning said: ""We encouraged students to come home for their own wellbeing.""
Protests over plans to allow extradition to mainland China and have become increasingly violent in recent months.
A number of clashes have broken out around universities in Hong Kong forcing many to close.
Mr Manning said graduations planned for some of the students have been cancelled and plans have been made to pay for them to return to the UK.
In total, 15 students had been in Hong Kong, with one on a work placement.
He said: ""It feels, at the moment, best to withdraw them. As the universities are closed it is best for them to come back.""
The University of Kent has paid for the flights and Mr Manning added that the students' grades would not be affected.
""Many of them understand why their fellow students are behaving the way they are.
""They don't feel threatened by the students but it is the collateral damage.""
On Wednesday, the Chinese University of Hong Kong said it would cancel classes for the rest of term after a violent stand-off between police and protesters.
In a statement published the same day, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said there had been ""clashes around a number of universities, with a particular focus at the Chinese University of Hong Kong in Sha Tin"" adding that students ""should avoid areas where protesters are gathered"" and ""take extra care when moving around the campus"".

"In 2019, there were 44 million fewer breeding birds in the UK than there were in the 1970s. There are thought to be fewer than one million hedgehogs, compared to 35 million in the 1950s. Two-thirds of British butterflies have also been on a downward trend since the 1970s, adding to a grim picture for biodiversity in the UK. “Biodiversity” simply means the variety of life on earth. Simply put, rich and diverse ecosystems are essential to the way we live. Take the way our food is grown. Agriculture depends on hundreds of different species to pollinate crops and help with pest control. A diverse range of animals, fungi and microbes decompose organic matter and enrich the soil with different micronutrients, making the food we grow more nutritious. A variety of plants also store carbon in their tissue at different rates and quantities, which is invaluable for slowing climate change. That’s why huge declines in biodiversity are so worrying, particularly among insects. They may not be dear to many of us, but they make up a large proportion of all living creatures. We’re fortunate in the UK to have very good data on the abundance of some species, particularly birds, butterflies and some mammals. This gives researchers a good understanding of trends over time. But what about everything else? There are many more groups of organisms out there that lack such information. To understand how these less well studied species are faring, we decided to use a different measure – distribution, or where a species can be found. In our latest study, my colleagues and I investigated how the distribution of over 5,000 of these UK species has changed over the last few decades, to try and get a broader look at how biodiversity is faring in the UK.  Our estimates of species distribution came from observations of species collected by volunteers. These estimates cover more than 5,000 UK species of invertebrates, mosses and lichens and extend back to 1970.  We found that the situation with these groups is more complicated than the average trends of well studied species. Essentially, not everything is declining. We did find a number of groups, including spiders and freshwater molluscs, whose distributions have declined, which means they’re absent from places they could be found 50 years ago. But overall, the average distribution across the 5,000 species increased by about 11%, with some species expanding into new areas.

 When we split these species into groups, we found some very interesting differences. Of the four groups that we assessed, only the invertebrates showed an average decline in distribution. This group included spiders, centipedes, millipedes, slugs and snails, and their average distribution has declined by almost 7%, which means they’re found in fewer places than they were in 1970.  The insect group, which contained over 3,000 species and included ants, ground beetles, soldierflies and fungus gnats, increased its average distribution by almost 6%, although there were considerable variations between species.  Perhaps the most intriguing findings were from freshwater species. This group initially declined between 1970 and the mid-1990s, but their distribution has bounced back to near 1970 levels in recent years. The freshwater insects include dragonflies, mayflies, stoneflies and caddisflies – groups of species that spend most of their lives in freshwater streams and rivers as larvae. All followed the same U-shaped pattern of decline and recovery. This reversal seems to coincide with the implementation of the EU Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive, so it’s possible that freshwater insects have benefited from efforts to clean up the UK’s rivers.   There was also an increase over time in the group containing mosses and lichens. Both are sensitive to air quality, so their partial recovery might be due to reductions in air pollution. These positive findings are very exciting, as they suggest that a downward trend can be reversed if the causes of the decline can be addressed. It’s important to remember that these are changes in distribution and not the number of individuals in a species. It’s possible that the numbers of the species in the groups studied here have fallen over the same period, but we can’t measure this with the kind of data we used. Spotting the patterns and common responses behind changes in distribution can suggest what the drivers might be. This research wouldn’t have been possible without all the volunteers that collect the biological records that underpin this study. The UK has a long history of biological recording and an interest in natural history that stretches back at least as far at the 19th century. It’s one of a few countries that has national recording schemes that include thousands of people with an interest in observing and collecting data on wildlife.  There are over 80 such schemes in the UK, collecting data on everything from insects, birds and mammals to plants and fungi. Without all of this information, we would know almost nothing about the state of the UK’s wildlife. While we may worry about the picture we have, we can take comfort in the fact that there are so many who care enough to give up their time to painstakingly record it."

On his website, Nick Stokes has set up an interesting global temperature anomaly visualization, based on NCEP/NCAR re-analysis data. The dry technical details are listed in this blog post. Based on his explanation, I’ve been able to closely duplicate his work to within +/-0.003 Kelvin degree, using different tools.
This post concentrates on using the NCEP/NCAR results to predict the prior month’s temperature anomalies for various global data sets, before they’re released. Here is a graph comparing NCEP/NCAR reanalysis anomalies with GISS, NCEI, UAHv6, RSS, and HadCRUT4 anomalies, from April 2015 to March 2016:
NCEP/NCAR Data comparison – Image Credit: Walter Dnes
There seem to be 2 separate populations, exhibiting different behaviours. They are reminiscent of 2 portions of a broken hockey-stick. For the purposes of this post, the cut-off between the 2 populations will be set to NCEP/NCAR anomaly of +0.45. This is an arbitrary point in the middle of a large gap, and may be changed in future months as more data accumulates. A table of monthly values for NCEP/NCAR, and the major global temperature data sets follows, along with slope, y-intercept, and extrapolated April values. I’d prefer to use 12 months of data for the extrapolation, but there are only 6 months (i.e. October 2015 to March 2016) in the population with NCEP/NCAR anomaly > +0.45. That is what is used for this post.

WordPress does not natively support embedded spreadsheets, without using plugins. So we’ll have to pretend that the above table represents a spreadsheet, with the word “Month” in the upper left corner, i.e. cell A1. In that case, the slope and y-intercept of the HadCRUT4 data would be calculated as “=slope(C2:C7,$B2:$B7)” and “=intercept(C2:C7,$B2:$B7)” respectively. GISS slope and y-intercept would be “=slope(D2:D7,$B2:$B7)” and “=intercept(D2:D7,$B2:$B7)” respectively, etc, etc.  Using the “$” prefix allows the formulas to be typed in to cells C9 and C10, and then the cell can be copied over horizontally for the other 4 data sets.
Given the slope and y-intercept, we can use a high-school math linear equation found here.
y = mx + b

“y” is the forecast anomaly for a temperature data set
“m” is the value of slope()
“x” is the value we supply, i.e. the NCEP/NCAR index
“b” is the value of intercept()

Continuing with the spreadsheet model, cell B12 would have the NCAR/NCEP value for the month we’re forecasting. Cell C12 would have the formula “=C9*$B12 + C10”. This cell can then be copied over horizontally for the next 4 cells.
There is one “sanity-check”, assuming a correlation. This month’s NCEP/NCAR anomaly is +0.645, which is between the values of December 2015 (+0.621) and January 2016 (+0.665). Consequently, one would expect the 5 other data sets to be somewhere in between their values for those 2 months. This is a “rule-of-thumb”, not an absolute guarantee.
Notes

Some WordPress fonts can make the dollar sign “$” difficult to distinguish from uppercase s “S”.  There are no uppercase s in the spreadsheet cell formulas listed above. if it looks like uppercase s, it’s actually a dollar-sign.
The above forecasts are approximate, and anything within +/-0.1 is going to have to be considered “good enough”.
The NCEP/NCAR re-analysis data runs a couple of days behind real-time. As of this posting, it has only been updated to April 28th. The values for April 29th and 30th have been assumed to be the same as April 28th, and the 30-day NCEP/NCAR anomaly has been extrapolated on that assumption.
Based on a few months of testing, GISS seems to come in closest to the extrapolated values. UAH and RSS come a close 2nd and 3rd. NOAA/NCEI used to have a good correlation until March 2016. That month they zigged, up, when everybody else zagged, down. HadCRUT4 has the lowest correlation of the 5 data sets.

Dr. Christopher Landsea, a scientist at the Hurricane Research Division of the U.S. Department of Commerce and one of the world’s foremost experts on hurricanes, has publicly resigned from authorship of an upcoming United Nations report on climate change. Landsea charged that the U.N.‘s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is “both being motivated by pre‐​conceived agendas and being scientifically unsound.” 



He has a point. The IPCC is more of a political body than a scientific authority. Its members are selected by their respective governments and approved by the UN Secretariat. This is not an unbiased, blind process. 



Remember those press conferences last fall where esteemed scientists blamed the severity of the 2004 hurricane season on global warming? One of them was another federal employee, Kevin Trenberth. According to Landsea, Trenberth hasn’t “performed any research on hurricane variability.” Nonetheless, he is the U.N.‘s designated “Lead Author” for the chapter of the report that discusses hurricanes and global warming, and as a result would supervise Landsea’s contributions. 



According to Landsea, “Given Dr. Trenberth’s role as the IPCC’s Lead Author responsible for preparing the text on hurricanes, his public statements so far outside of current scientific understanding led me to concern that it would be very difficult for the IPCC process to proceed objectively with regards to the assessment on hurricane activity.” 



Indeed, there is absolutely no evidence that hurricane frequency or severity has increased because of global warming. In fact, the only detectable change in Atlantic hurricanes is a decline in average maximum wind speed, as shown in Landsea’s own published scientific writing. 



Trenberth also advocates the position that global warming will make “El Nino” stronger, with very little scientific evidence. El Ninos are periodic reversals of Pacific trade winds that change storm tracks thousands of miles away. They also destroy Atlantic hurricanes. If global warming actually did make El Ninos more frequent or stronger, hurricane intensity should decrease. 



Landsea appealed to the head of the UN’s climate panel, Rajenda Pachauri, to uphold genuine scientific inquiry. 



He should have known better. Pachauri penned the foreword to the 2004 report, “Up in Smoke,” distributed by environmental activists including Greenpeace and the World Wildlife Fund. Referring to hurricanes, it said “in a world in which global warming is already happening, such severe weather events are likely to be more frequent, and extreme.” 



Pachauri dismissed Landsea’s complaint out of hand, which led to the scientist’s principled resignation. 



If elements of this story trigger a sense of _déjà vu,_ then readers have been paying attention. There was a minor stir last fall when two government scientists predicted a slight (6 percent) increase in hurricane strength over the next century, due to global warming. 



They arrived at this prediction by using a computer model that assumed carbon dioxide will leach into the atmosphere at a rate that is twice what has been observed in recent decades. The model fails miserably when it attempts to forecast hurricanes in the real world, because it assumes no changes in hurricane environments as the planet warms. Critical scientists knew about the model’s shortcomings, but they held their peace. 



This is becoming a pattern. Scientists, or people claiming the mantle of science, advance terribly flawed claims that the sky is falling; climate scientists who understand that this is false say next to nothing. 



Why? 



There are several reasons. Just as medical doctors care about human suffering, environmental scientists are often philosophically concerned about what they judge to be environmental degradation. Neither concern is “scientific” in the sense that it is concerned with testing theories against available evidence, but they do influence the way scientists behave. 



Then there’s the money. Climatology used to be very un‐​cool, and largely un‐​funded. It was an impoverished backwater until global warming came along. Now it’s a tremendous sink hole for tax dollars. 



The next federal budget is likely to propose around $4 billion for research on climate change. That money will only be allocated if global warming is presented as a severe threat to our health and well‐​being on the level of AIDS or cancer. So we end up with under‐​funded voices of sanity and a lot of well‐​funded Chicken Little‐​types. 



So far, this level of distortion has carried no cost to the prestige of the dissemblers. The United Nations now passes itself off as the world’s authority on the effects of climate change and tropical cyclones while keeping a propagandist on the payroll. Perhaps President Bush, who ultimately must approve U.S. members for the panel, should approve none, effectively withdrawing his government from this pseudoscientific charade.
"
"The Department of Climate Change base their case for Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW), now referred to as ‘Climate Change’, on an uncritical acceptance of the IPCC’s Reports. Claims are made that these findings are supported by a ‘consensus’ of scientists and scientific opinion.
 
This however is increasingly not the case as literally thousands of peer reviewed and published papers and many thousands of highly respected scientists, including some who contributed to the IPCC Reports, are now concerned that these findings lack an adequate or convincing scientific base.

Despite the expenditure of over $50 billion to find evidence that man-induced greenhouse gasses are the primary cause of the current warming, not one piece of empirical evidence in support of this theory has been found.
 
The infamous ‘Hockey Stick Graph’ (Mann et al.) has been comprehensively discredited and has been removed by the IPCC from their 4th Report. It is therefore surprising to still find it in the government’s section on the scientific justification of ‘Climate Change’.
 
Likewise the claims that temperature has historically over the last 650,000 years moved in close relationship with levels of CO2 in the atmosphere is disingenuous. The Vostok and other ice core data clearly show that there is an average 800-year lag time between temperature rise and the subsequent increase in CO2 levels. This clearly indicates that CO2 was not the cause of the warming but resulted naturally from it, and that the peak levels CO2 reached did not inhibit the subsequent coolings that occurred.
 
There is much evidence that warming has occurred and that CO2 (and other greenhouse gasses) have increased, but no evidence to link the two. There are other valid explanations.
 
The IPCC (and the Australian Government) are therefore relying solely on computer models to justify their stand. While these models have improved, it is nevertheless widely accepted that they are incapable of predicting future climate. Even the IPCC agree.
 
And even Houghton says, “The fact that the mean global temperature has increased since the late 19th century and that other trends have been observed does not necessarily mean that an anthropogenic effect on the climate has been identified. Climate has always varied on all time-scales, so the observed change may be natural” (Chapter 1 of Houghton et al 2001).
 
Climate models are ‘uncertain’ about the effect of clouds on temperature and entirely ignore the influence of the varying magnetic flux of the sun and its effect on world climate, amongst many other shortcomings.
 
The world has failed to warm over the last decade, despite rapidly escalating levels of CO2. This fact alone should be cause to at least check the facts before implementing far reaching new policies designed to ‘mitigate’ climate change.
 
But the reasons are much broader than this and the consequences for both the Australian population and the Government from ‘getting it wrong’ are so great that it would be both wise and prudent to at least comprehensively and openly check the science before implementing these measures.
 
Finally, even if Australia entirely eliminated its emissions (impossible), China alone last year increased its emissions by more than our total, effectively negating all Australian actions and making them a costly exercise in futility.

Guest essay by Eric Worrall
Never mind he’s not even President yet – greens are already trying to pin the blame for the embarrassing slow motion collapse of the Paris Climate Agreement on US Presidential Candidate Donald Trump.
Trump’s Climate Change Denial Is Already Complicating the Paris Climate Deal
If Donald Trump wins and pulls the U.S. out of its climate change commitments, some countries wonder, why should they keep their own?
Donald Trump first shared his analysis of the climate crisis in a now infamous 2012 tweet-rant: “The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive,” he claimed.
The Republican presidential hopeful has since dialed back the rhetoric, calling that earlier claim a joke. But — as in other areas of critical domestic and international concern — he’s fallen short when pressed for specifics on what a Trump presidency would mean for energy and the climate. It seemed his oft-repeated phrase “trust me, I’ll get the best people“ was as close as the American public was going to get to details.
Until now.
The best Trump could find turns out to be climate denier and staunch fossil fuel backer Kevin Cramer, a two-term Republican congressman from oil- and coal-rich North Dakota. As a newly tapped energy adviser, Cramer recently handed the Trump campaign a four-page policy paper urging the candidate to scrap the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan, among other regulations introduced by the EPA to curb pollution from the energy sector.

Trump promised to cancel the Paris Climate Agreement in an earlier speech.
Earlier this month, he told Reuters in an interview that he would renegotiate “at a minimum” the U.N. global climate accord agreed by 195 countries in Paris last December, saying he viewed the deal as bad for U.S. business.
He took that a step further in North Dakota. “We’re going to cancel the Paris climate agreement,” he said.
Read more: http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-energy-idUSKCN0YH2D9
Everyone knows the Paris agreement was dead on arrival. President Obama’s desperation to get China on board, by granting a joke size concession, the Chinese “commitment” not to do anything about CO2 emissions until 2030, created an intolerable structural economic advantage. Add the ongoing split with Russia about the implementation of the Paris Accord, it was only a matter of time before the agreement collapsed.
In my opinion, Greens are well aware that the agreement was doomed from the outset. Now they’re just trying to save face, by trying to pin the blame on someone else, for their own political blunders.

“The Arctic Ocean is warming up, icebergs are growing scarcer, and in some places the seals are finding the water too hot. Reports from fishermen, seal hunters, and explorers all point to a radical change in climate conditions and hitherto unheard‐​of temperatures in the Arctic zone. Exploration expeditions report that scarcely any ice has been met as far north as 81 degrees 29 minutes. Within a few years it is predicted that due to the ice melt the sea will rise and make most coastal cities uninhabitable.” — from an Associated Press report published in _The Washington Post_ on Nov. 2, 1922.



You may have noticed that the predicted disaster 92 years ago did not happen, nor have other predicted catastrophes from the global‐​warming crowd.



On July 5, 1989, Noel Brown, then the director of the New York office of the United Nations Environment Program, warned of a “10‐​year window of opportunity to solve” global warming “entire nations could be wiped off the face of Earth by rising sea levels if the global‐​warming trend is not reversed by the year 2000. Coastal flooding and crop failures would create an exodus of ‘eco‐​refugees,’ threatening political chaos.”





The reason we have a global warming crisis is because crisis sells.



The U.N.-forecast disaster never occurred. However, thanks must be given to Mother Nature for the unexpected 17‐​year pause in global warming rather than the actions of mankind, which have continued to spew out carbon dioxide at record levels. This little error has not stopped the doomsayers at the U.N.



In 2007, the chief of the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said, “If there’s no action before 2012, that’s too late. What we do in the next two to three years will determine our future. This is the defining moment.” It is now 2014 and nothing was done before 2012, so, since it is “too late,” why spend any more time and money fighting global warming?



On Jan. 19, 2009, James Hansen, climate expert who until last year was head of NASA’s Goddard Institute of Space Studies, firmly declared that President Obama “has only four years to save the Earth” which you might have noticed he failed to do. Back in 2006, Al Gore told us that we had only “10 years” to solve the global‐​warming problem.



Since his recommendations are most unlikely to be accepted and acted on in the next two years, and since there has been no statistically significant warming since the former vice president received his vision, what do you think he will say two years from now?



“The longer the planners delay, the more difficult will they find it to cope with climate change once the results have become grim reality.” This is from an article in Newsweek on April 28, 1975, warning us of the dangers of global cooling. (You can find most of these and many more quotes on the Climate Depot website, collected by Marc Morano, illustrating how little the experts really know about climate change.)



The just‐​released report by the IPCC toned down much of the rhetoric from its previous reports because its predictive models failed to anticipate the 17‐​year pause in warming and the increasing disagreements among the many “experts” who were involved in drafting the report. For years, knowledgeable and thoughtful critics of the earlier IPCC reports, such as the United Kingdom’s Nigel Lawson, former chancellor of the Exchequer, have been arguing that it made far more economic sense to concentrate on adaptation rather than mitigation, which is probably impossible with existing technologies as well as the political reality.



For instance, sea levels have been slowly rising since the end of the Little Ice Age around 1850. Coastal cities have not disappeared, though, because in the normal course of constantly rebuilding structures and infrastructures, we have been elevating them. For the most part, this is not a piece of some grand master plan (other than building codes for new structures), but the basic fact is that “new” cities are constantly being built on top of “old cities,” a practice that has gone on for at least a few thousand years.



The good news is that mankind will probably adapt to climate change just fine, as we have been adapting since the end of the Ice Age. New studies show that to date, the benefits of global warming have been greater than the costs, and are likely to remain so for many more decades. More carbon dioxide, warmer temperatures and more rainfall benefit farming. Shipping costs are reduced as ports, roads and rails have more ice‐ and snow‐​free days. Cold weather kills more people than warm weather, and most people enjoy longer warm seasons for sports and other recreation.



The reason we have a global warming crisis is because crisis sells. It allows politicians to tax, spend and assert more control. Undoubtedly, more people would have read this column, if the headline had been, “World to end.” So ignore the “experts” and enjoy the summer, which most of us will find is too short.

"The aging galloper “Ration-N-Tax” from the Wong stable is knackered.
Anyone with any economic or political nous knows that the carbon cap proposals are neither politically nor economically possible in Australia or the USA. No electorate in the western world will sit by to see their standard of living reduced until their carbon emissions per capita are equal to those of India or China while they transfer their businesses and technology to these growing industrial giants of Asia.
From now on, those pushing the RAT Scheme are flogging a dead horse. Public opinion is changing swiftly and any time soon even Malcolm Turnbull will switch his bets.
But the canny handlers anticipated this result and have another nag saddled and ready.

Oh dear, oh, dear. It seems all is not rosy in the green world of hybrid motoring. The plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) owners are not actually saving the planet. Woe is me!



It seems that the claimed ‘economy’ figures touted by the manufacturers **are** **not actually achievable** out here in the real world. 



The theory is that because PHEVs can switch between battery electric power and an internal combustion engine, they will deliver significant emissions and fuel economy improvements over traditional cars, thereby saving us all from certain climate doom.



Environmental campaigners have concerns that these heavily advertised figures – which are used online and in TV adverts promoting the vehicles – are misrepresentative, as highlighted by a new market review.



The Guardian reports that many popular plug-in hybrids don’t maximise the use of green electric power due to limitations with the technology.



It reviewed models that feature zero-emission driving modes, which when selected are designed for the vehicle to operate only using electric power without switched [SIC] to the supplementary petrol engine. 



The report found that many of these modes switch off if the conditions are not suitable for the vehicle or technology. 



Driving in cold winter weather? PHEV switches to petrol even with a fully charged battery as the batteries need to warm up to send power to the electric motors. (Volvo XC90 Twin Engine, Mercedes-Benz E300 and Kia Niro Plug-In Hybrid)



Need to demist the windscreen? PHEV switches to petrol. (Kia Niro)



Turn on cabin heating to keep warm? PHEV switches to petrol.



Need to bury boot? PHEV switches to petrol. (Range Rover’s p400e and Porsche’s Cayenne E-Hybrid)



Exceed a pre-set speed? PHEV switches to petrol. (BMW’s range of plug-in hybrids – including the Mini Countryman Plug-in Hybrid). 



Want to use adaptive cruise control? PHEV switches to petrol. (Mitsubishi’s Outlander)



Battery gets too hot or too cold in extreme conditions? PHEV switches to petrol. (Mitsubishi’s Outlander) 



Feel the need to keep Greta happy – buy a PHEV

It’s a tough gig, being a socialist: not only do you have to remember in which of your collection of houses you’ll be uncorking the Chateau Lafite this weekend, it’s getting hard to find help who can even speak enough English to direct you to the right private jet.



Far-left Democratic presidential candidate Sen. **Bernie Sanders** (I-VT), a socialist and climate change alarmist, accidentally boarded the wrong private jet, reported TMZ on Saturday.



“The Democratic front-runner was spotted Saturday making his way off of a private Gulfstream between campaign stops in South Carolina and Massachusetts — the latter being where he held a rally at Boston Common ahead of Super Tuesday,” the TMZ report outlined.



The outlet also included a photo of Sanders seemingly walking off the private jet that was not his. “Bernie’s been flying all over the country for different campaign events,” said TMZ, “[m]istakes like this (getting on the wrong Gulfstream) are bound to happen.”



Well, of course. I’m forever finding myself waking up on the wrong yacht in the Seychelles or Phuket. Why, only last week I accidentally shouted at the wrong maid – well, hey, all those undocumenteds look the same, anyway.



So, don’t criticise the multimillionaire commie – he’s got a planet to save, after all.



While Sanders promotes socialist solutions to his climate alarmism, the Vermont senator spent a whopping $1.2 million on private jet travel in just three months, from October to December of 2019, The Daily Wire highlighted in February.



“Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) is campaigning to be the 2020 Democratic presidential nominee on a progressive, socialist agenda, but his campaign’s spending is more in line with the ‘one percent’ than the working class,” The Daily Wire noted. “The Washington Free Beacon reports that Sanders’ campaign spent an astounding $1.2 million on private jets during the last quarter of 2019 — more, even, than former Vice President Joe Biden and billionaire presidential candidate, former New York City mayor **Michael Bloomberg**.”



“Sanders’ Federal Election Commission filings reveal that the ‘Democratic socialist’ shelled out $1,199,579 to Apollo Jets, LLC, a ‘luxury private jet charter service,’ per the Free Beacon, even though his own campaign views private air travel as one of the top contributors to climate change (and as a luxury of the rich, to boot). The campaign paid an additional $23,941 to a Virginia-based private pilot service,” the report continued.



Hey, you think saving the planet comes easy? Or cheap?



Typical. The only thing standing in the way of the glorious socialist utopia is all you damned whinging plebs.



Now, out of my way, peasants, I’ve got a Gulfstream standing by and the Dom Perignon isn’t getting any cooler.

"PARIS  —   France’s financial prosecution office opened an embezzlement investigation Wednesday into François Fillon, a leading presidential candidate, following a newspaper report that his wife had been paid around $535, 000 in public money for a   job, a revelation that could upend the tightly contested election. Mr. Fillon, who won November’s   primary, has been considered a favorite in the race, but now must contend with questions about whether the payments to his wife were inappropriate. According to the satirical weekly The Canard Enchaîné, Mr. Fillon’s wife, Penelope, received about 500, 000 euros over eight years, first as his parliamentary assistant and then as assistant to his deputy Marc Joulaud, who took over when Mr. Fillon became a minister in the government in 2002. It is not illegal in France for members of Parliament to employ family, and around 10 to 15 percent do so, according to French media. But if Mrs. Fillon did nothing, holding a fake job, in effect, in return for the public funds, her husband could be in trouble. “This could be painful to Fillon, fairly damaging,” Gérard Grunberg, a political scientist at   the prestigious political science institute, said Wednesday in an interview. He added: “Everything depends on whether it was a bogus job. If it’s proved that it was  —   and a   one, too  —   then this is going to be important. She always said she didn’t participate in political life. So she sort of condemned herself in advance. ” Mr. Fillon, the   candidate, has been leading in polls, ahead of his two main challengers, Marine Le Pen of the   National Front, and the former economy minister in the Socialist government, Emmanuel Macron, who is running as an independent. The general election is in April, with a runoff expected in May. Either Ms. Le Pen  —   most likely  —   or Mr. Macron will wind up in the presidential runoff against Mr. Fillon, analysts have predicted. In a 2012 posting on Twitter, Mr. Fillon denounced those who “don’t work and receive public money,” in what has become a principal theme of his campaign. But in its investigation, The Canard Enchaîné quoted another of Mr. Joulaud’s assistants as saying: “I never worked with her,” adding, “I knew her only as the minister’s wife. ” Mrs. Fillon has always told interviewers that she stayed away from politics and devoted herself to the couple’s five children, and to domestic pursuits. Of Welsh origin, Mrs. Fillon has been known for her interest in horses and has been photographed with her family in and around the couple’s chateau in Western France. The affair could be all the more damaging because the image of Mr. Fillon has been based on probity and austerity, and he has called for sacrifices from the French, including cuts to civil servant jobs. Campaigning in Bordeaux on Wednesday, Mr. Fillon angrily denounced the new reports as “stink balls,” saying, “So, because she’s my wife, she doesn’t have the right to work. ” He called the Canard’s report “misogynist. ” On Twitter he wrote, “I’m astonished that these old, and legal, facts have become a story, three months from the first round of presidential voting. ” The Socialists criticized Mr. Fillon on Wednesday. “You can’t call yourself the candidate of honesty, of transparency, and then be unable to explain yourself on these matters,” said Manuel Valls, one of two in the Socialists’ primary runoff on Sunday. The Canard also reported that Mrs. Fillon had been paid 5, 000 euros a month over a year and a half by a wealthy friend of Mr. Fillon’s, Marc Ladreit de Lacharrière, who owns The Revue des Deux Mondes, an   political review. The newspaper suggested that Mrs. Fillon had in fact done little work in return for the pay."

It looks like Bill Nye has just given Marc Morano’s film “Climate Hustle” a huge boost by bringing the Streisand Effect into full force.
Dennis Kuzara writes:

It looks like Bill Nye has just given Marc Morano’s film “Climate Hustle” a huge boost by bringing the Streisand Effect into full force.
The “Streisand Effect” is the phenomenon whereby an attempt to hide, remove, or censor a piece of information has the unintended consequence of publicizing the information more widely, usually facilitated by the Internet. It is an example of psychological reactance, wherein once people are aware something is being kept from them, their motivation to access the information is increased.
Mike Masnick of Techdirt coined the term after American entertainer Barbra Streisand, whose 2003 lawsuit to remove “Image 3850″ of her beach front residence in Malibu, California and had only been viewed 6 times, resulted in the image being viewed about a half million times within a month.
Bill Nye, who wants to throw climate skeptics in the slammer, warns moviegoers to Shun Film’s 1-Day Theater Release: “I think it will expose your point of view as very much in the minority and very much not in our national interest and the world’s interest.” And U.N. Climate Scientist Michael “The End of the Climate As You Know It” Oppenheimer has also condemned the film. He claims.“Marc is a propagandist”.
What better proof of what free Streisand Effect advertising produces than some of the comments on mrctv.org about Bill Nye’s warnings:
Verbotene Gedanken
Thank you Bill for alerting me to this important film.
I will be attending the first showing I can get to.
I’ll buy an extra ticket and leave it for you at the window.

Agree! I didn’t know it was coming out on May 2nd. Mandatory attendance for my family!

Smitty Werben Jaegerman Jansen
Like any leftist BS artist… he can’t keep his mouth shut. Impossible task.
“Climate Hustle” will be in theaters for a one-night event on Monday, May 2nd, and will include an exclusive panel discussion following the film featuring Gov. Sarah Palin, climatologist Dr. David Legates, Media Research Center Pres. Brent Bozell, and film host Marc Morano.

Yesterday a press release landed in my inbox and I couldn’t stop laughing. The fact that it is a serious new NZ political party that has been created to fight this year’s election makes it even funnier.



I challenge you all to read it in your head with a “How dare you” toned Greta Thunberg voice over and see how long it is before you snigger.



Press Release: **The Planets Party**



 **Global Warming is real and it’s happening now.**



**We know it. You know it. We ALL know it.**  
 **The time for talking is over.**  
 **It’s time for us ALL to act.**



 **So, what can you do?**



Global warming is making the planet uninhabitable and attempts by governments and activists have failed to address the problem fast enough. Real change is needed NOW 



The Planets Party has been established to bring about that change directly through the ballot box, thanks to MMP (Mixed Member Proportional voting system). 



The Planets Party does NOT have to win the elections to **force** through change. We simply need to hold a sufficient percentage of the vote so that other parties will have to adopt some, or all, of the policies from The Planets Party to form a government with us. 



The Planets Party has two policies: 



**Our Plan for NZ**



We will engage top global warming scientists to review the New Zealand territory and put forward a 3- year plan that will ensure NZ is on track to keep Global Warming within a 2C limit. 



The plan will be produced within 3 months and all parts of the plan will be started within 1 year. We are strongly committed to ensuring every task in the plan is completed within its allocated timeframe. 



While we can’t anticipate everything the plan will recommend we can be confident we will need to take action in the following areas: 



New Zealand must be prepared to: 



**Tariffs**



A possible input to this work will be the work done by the [Cross Party Climate Change Commission (NZ) ](https://www.climatecommission.govt.nz/)



To encourage other countries to make a similar effort as we are to implement their own targets (as determined by the IPCC), New Zealand will **impose Tariffs on all imports** from non-complying countries: 



It is hoped that like-minded countries will come into line with their own IPCC compliant plans, but New Zealand must be prepared to accept reciprocal tariffs if we are failing to reach our own targets. 



This may require that NZ pulls out of existing Trade agreements; but countries that already are not meeting their obligations to meet the Paris agreement, are already in breach of their agreements. 



New Zealand must be prepared accept any potential retaliation, which may be significant. 



How does NZ intend to pay for these Policies 



The policies needed to meet our Global Warming obligations will be provided by one or more of the following: 



Large Digital Technology Firms have avoided paying their fair share of tax in New Zealand so New Zealand will follow France, Europe, other Asian and Latin American countries example and tax “profits” made in NZ, at source.



 **We know this may sound like a hard line, but only a hard line will ensure the survival of our planet. And the time to take that hard line is NOW.**



Make 2020 the year of Action!

"The Chairman of the Carbon Sense Coalition, Mr Viv Forbes, today claimed that the plan by  Australian PM Rudd to cull one million camels may have unexpected carbon tax consequences.
Forbes explains:
“PM Rudd proposes to spend $19 million shooting one million wild camels.
“A big camel probably weighs about a tonne, so Mr Rudd is going to let a million tonnes of valuable meat rot under the Centralian sun.
“Each camel probably has about 190 kg of carbon sequestered in its body. As it rots and absorbs oxygen, this carbon will increase into about 700 kg of carbon dioxide which will then dissipate into the atmosphere.
“If the Australian Senate is silly enough to pass the Wong carbon dioxide Ration-n-Tax Scheme this shootout will thus trigger a huge carbon tax liability.
“At a carbon emission price of say $40 per tonne of carbon dioxide, the carbon tax on one million rotting camels would be about $28 million.
“If we add to that the actual cull costs of about $19 million and the carbon tax due on helicopter emissions and other activities, the total cost of the cull is about $50 million.
“This illustrates the dangers of costly unexpected consequences resulting from complex poorly designed bills being rushed through both Australian and US Legislatures by Mr Rudd and his buddy Mr Obama. Luckily Senators in both countries will probably reject this nonsense.

“If not, this $50 million invoice for the full costs of the camel shootout should not be presented to the taxpayers, but sent to Cull Commander Minister Garrett.
“This may convince him to chase up a few old Territorian buffalo shooters who could make a tidy profit at no cost to the taxpayer by culling the camels and selling the meat to Taiwan. Or we could sell permits to a few big game hunters. Or sell live camels to the Arabs.”
A Reader’s Comment:
Culling is a stupid blind man’s solution to the camel problem…!!
By Paddy McHugh
My name is Paddy McHugh and I have been working with camels in Australia and overseas for some 35 years. I am deeply disturbed by what is about to happen and feel that people and the media have only been told only one side of the story and a very slanted and incorrect one at that. Spending 19 million dollars on the wholesale slaughter of camels is not the answer. I would like to bring to your attention another side of the Australian camel problem and the industry’s potential.
The current proposal leads down the path of mass slaughter, disease potential from rotting carcasses, dingo explosion and missed opportunities. There is another road which looks to the future – a golden opportunity for another viable rural industry for this country with employment in a new bio-diverse industry that will employ hundreds of Aboriginal people and bring large amounts of export dollars into this country.
The traditional land owners are yet again about to be ripped off and left in the dark. The people in APY lands and CLC deserts are being told complete untruths and are having the wool pulled over their eyes in one of the greatest and most immoral scams this country has ever witnessed.
As a very good friend of mine has stated “The Camel is the animal of the 22nd century” This statement came from Dr Alex Tinson who is quite possibly the world’s leading camel vet and works for the President of the UAE.
My office receives dozens of emails seeking camel products from milk, meat, blood and all the by-products that come from this animal – the international potential for this industry is immense.
It is an animal easily farmed like cattle and sheep and has a far less detrimental impact on the environment. In fact camels enhance the land by helping eradicate woody weeds and have a forage overlap of no more the 20% with cattle and sheep. 70% of Australia’s land mass is classed arid, why are we not farming camels?
The commercial side of this potential industry has been suppressed in discussions regarding the feral problem.
A mandate to shoot the camel at any cost is absurd. People who advocate this are completely one track and have absolutely no vision or hands on experience in the husbandry and handling of this animal.
Out of the 19 million dollars that has been allocated for this slaughter none of it has been put into education and training or industry development and that is where the bulk of this funding should be put. Who is accountable here?
What happens in years to come when the camel population comes back to the same present numbers, do we spend another 20 million dollars..!! again and again I acknowledge that we do have a camel problem that needs to be fixed, but mass shooting of them is certainly not the answer. It is not even close. All parties need to come together and discuss this animal’s future.
A real camel industry could not only fix the immediate problem but also stabilise the long
term and give many people a great future.
For years I have passionately championed the camel and its potential in Australia. It is now time to take a firm stand against the so called experts who are ill informed on these matters. Many people will have senseless blood on their hands with what is about to happen. I will not let the mindless slaughter of these animals take place.
I look forward to sitting down and discussing this for the good of all Australians.

"Our society has evolved so much, can we still say that we are part of Nature? If not, should we worry – and what should we do about it? Poppy, 21, Warwick. Such is the extent of our dominion on Earth, that the answer to questions around whether we are still part of nature – and whether we even need some of it – rely on an understanding of what we want as Homo sapiens. And to know what we want, we need to grasp what we are. It is a huge question – but they are the best. And as a biologist, here is my humble suggestion to address it, and a personal conclusion. You may have a different one, but what matters is that we reflect on it. Perhaps the best place to start is to consider what makes us human in the first place, which is not as obvious as it may seem.  This article is part of Life’s Big Questions
The Conversation’s new series, co-published with BBC Future, seeks to answer our readers’ nagging questions about life, love, death and the universe. We work with professional researchers who have dedicated their lives to uncovering new perspectives on the questions that shape our lives. Many years ago, a novel written by Vercors called Les Animaux dénaturés (“Denatured Animals”) told the story of a group of primitive hominids, the Tropis, found in an unexplored jungle in New Guinea, who seem to constitute a missing link. However, the prospect that this fictional group may be used as slave labour by an entrepreneurial businessman named Vancruysen forces society to decide whether the Tropis are simply sophisticated animals or whether they should be given human rights. And herein lies the difficulty. Human status had hitherto seemed so obvious that the book describes how it is soon discovered that there is no definition of what a human actually is. Certainly, the string of experts consulted – anthropologists, primatologists, psychologists, lawyers and clergymen – could not agree. Perhaps prophetically, it is a layperson who suggested a possible way forward.  She asked whether some of the hominids’ habits could be described as the early signs of a spiritual or religious mind. In short, were there signs that, like us, the Tropis were no longer “at one” with nature, but had separated from it, and were now looking at it from the outside – with some fear. It is a telling perspective. Our status as altered or “denatured” animals – creatures who have arguably separated from the natural world – is perhaps both the source of our humanity and the cause of many of our troubles. In the words of the book’s author: All man’s troubles arise from the fact that we do not know what we are and do not agree on what we want to be. We will probably never know the timing of our gradual separation from nature – although cave paintings perhaps contain some clues. But a key recent event in our relationship with the world around us is as well documented as it was abrupt. It happened on a sunny Monday morning, at 8.15am precisely. The atomic bomb that rocked Hiroshima on August 6 1945, was a wake-up call so loud that it still resonates in our consciousness many decades later. The day the “sun rose twice” was not only a forceful demonstration of the new era that we had entered, it was a reminder of how paradoxically primitive we remained: differential calculus, advanced electronics and almost godlike insights into the laws of the universe helped build, well … a very big stick. Modern Homo sapiens seemingly had developed the powers of gods, while keeping the psyche of a stereotypical Stone Age killer. We were no longer fearful of nature, but of what we would do to it, and ourselves. In short, we still did not know where we came from, but began panicking about where we were going. We now know a lot more about our origins but we remain unsure about what we want to be in the future – or, increasingly, as the climate crisis accelerates, whether we even have one. Arguably, the greater choices granted by our technological advances make it even more difficult to decide which of the many paths to take. This is the cost of freedom. I am not arguing against our dominion over nature nor, even as a biologist, do I feel a need to preserve the status quo. Big changes are part of our evolution. After all, oxygen was first a poison which threatened the very existence of early life, yet it is now the fuel vital to our existence. Similarly, we may have to accept that what we do, even our unprecedented dominion, is a natural consequence of what we have evolved into, and by a process nothing less natural than natural selection itself. If artificial birth control is unnatural, so is reduced infant mortality.  I am also not convinced by the argument against genetic engineering on the basis that it is “unnatural”. By artificially selecting specific strains of wheat or dogs, we had been tinkering more or less blindly with genomes for centuries before the genetic revolution. Even our choice of romantic partner is a form of genetic engineering. Sex is nature’s way of producing new genetic combinations quickly. Even nature, it seems, can be impatient with itself. Advances in genomics, however, have opened the door to another key turning point. Perhaps we can avoid blowing up the world, and instead change it – and ourselves – slowly, perhaps beyond recognition. The development of genetically modified crops in the 1980s quickly moved from early aspirations to improve the taste of food to a more efficient way of destroying undesirable weeds or pests. In what some saw as the genetic equivalent of the atomic bomb, our early forays into a new technology became once again largely about killing, coupled with worries about contamination. Not that everything was rosy before that. Artificial selection, intensive farming and our exploding population growth were long destroying species quicker than we could record them. The increasing “silent springs” of the 1950s and 60s caused by the destruction of farmland birds – and, consequently, their song – was only the tip of a deeper and more sinister iceberg. There is, in principle, nothing unnatural about extinction, which has been a recurring pattern (of sometimes massive proportions) in the evolution of our planet long before we came on the scene. But is it really what we want? The arguments for maintaining biodiversity are usually based on survival, economics or ethics. In addition to preserving obvious key environments essential to our ecosystem and global survival, the economic argument highlights the possibility that a hitherto insignificant lichen, bacteria or reptile might hold the key to the cure of a future disease. We simply cannot afford to destroy what we do not know. But attaching an economic value to life makes it subject to the fluctuation of markets. It is reasonable to expect that, in time, most biological solutions will be able to be synthesised, and as the market worth of many lifeforms falls, we need to scrutinise the significance of the ethical argument. Do we need nature because of its inherent value?  Perhaps the answer may come from peering over the horizon. It is somewhat of an irony that as the third millennium coincided with decrypting the human genome, perhaps the start of the fourth may be about whether it has become redundant. Just as genetic modification may one day lead to the end of “Homo sapiens naturalis” (that is, humans untouched by genetic engineering), we may one day wave goodbye to the last specimen of Homo sapiens genetica. That is the last fully genetically based human living in a world increasingly less burdened by our biological form – minds in a machine. If the essence of a human, including our memories, desires and values, is somehow reflected in the pattern of the delicate neuronal connections of our brain (and why should it not?) our minds may also one day be changeable like never before. And this brings us to the essential question that surely we must ask ourselves now: if, or rather when, we have the power to change anything, what would we not change? After all, we may be able to transform ourselves into more rational, more efficient and stronger individuals. We may venture out further, have greater dominion over greater areas of space, and inject enough insight to bridge the gap between the issues brought about by our cultural evolution and the abilities of a brain evolved to deal with much simpler problems. We might even decide to move into a bodiless intelligence: in the end, even the pleasures of the body are located in the brain. And then what? When the secrets of the universe are no longer hidden, what makes it worth being part of it? Where is the fun? “Gossip and sex, of course!” some might say. And in effect, I would agree (although I might put it differently), as it conveys to me the fundamental need that we have to reach out and connect with others. I believe that the attributes that define our worth in this vast and changing universe are simple: empathy and love. Not power or technology, which occupy so many of our thoughts but which are merely (almost boringly) related to the age of a civilisation. Like many a traveller, Homo sapiens may need a goal. But from the strengths that come with attaining it, one realises that one’s worth (whether as an individual or a species) ultimately lies elsewhere. So I believe that the extent of our ability for empathy and love will be the yardstick by which our civilisation is judged. It may well be an important benchmark by which we will judge other civilisations that we may encounter, or indeed be judged by them. There is something of true wonder at the basis of it all. The fact that chemicals can arise from the austere confines of an ancient molecular soup, and through the cold laws of evolution, combine into organisms that care for other lifeforms (that is, other bags of chemicals) is the true miracle. Some ancients believed that God made us in “his image”. Perhaps they were right in a sense, as empathy and love are truly godlike features, at least among the benevolent gods. Cherish those traits and use them now, Poppy, as they hold the solution to our ethical dilemma. It is those very attributes that should compel us to improve the wellbeing of our fellow humans without lowering the condition of what surrounds us. Anything less will pervert (our) nature.

You Ought to Have a Look _is a regular feature from the Center for the Study of Science. While this section will feature all of the areas of interest that we are emphasizing, the prominence of the climate issue is driving a tremendous amount of web traffic. Here we post a few of the best in recent days, along with our color commentary._   
  
\---   
  
This week, all eyes have been on Hurricane, now-Tropical-Storm, Hermine.   
  
Since the Hermine coverage has been non-stop and ubiquitous, instead of highlighting anything in particular on the intertubes, we thought we’d give you our specific take on the events of this (and next) week. Here goes.   
  
We’re about to take the national Rorschach test that accompanies headline storms, as the leftovers from Hurricane Hermine are going to spin away for a week off the mid-Atlantic coast, generating humongous seas and climate change blathering.   
  
Dealing with the former won't be better informed by the latter—an uneccessary and largely unjustified interloper/distraction.   
  
The storm will be the result of an unhappy marriage between a hurricane or tropical storm remnant and a garden variety upper-atmospheric low pressure system. For reasons having everything to do with bad luck, the jet stream is going to be “blocked” in place for nearly a week, so that anything that would normally be steered from west to east is just going to sit. And sit.



The waters off the mid-Atlantic coast are near their seasonal maximum, and they’re also several degrees above normal. (Note—in the northeastern Atlantic, they’re several degrees below average.) That’s going to provide a tad more energy to the storm as it stalls out, but that’s not going to last long. A huge donut of 50-70mph winds sitting in the same place will mix out the surface warmth pronto, and what will be the main event will be more like a strong winter northeaster that gets stuck in one place, like the Ash Wednesday storm of 1962, which caused a huge amount of coastal damage from Cape Cod to South Carolina   
  
If that repeated now, owing to the tremendous coastal development since then, it would easily be among the most expensive storm in our history. Fortunately (at least as of this writing) it looks like the persistent strong winds are going to be coming from the north, resulting in only modest (two to four foot) storm surges.   
  
This is hardly the first time that a decaying hurricane has been enmeshed with a stagnant upper air storm. In fact, the resemblance between Hermine and 1972’s Hurricane Agnes is astounding.   
  
Both came ashore rated as 80mph storms on the Florida panhandle. Neither actually generated an observed hurricane-force sustained wind on land. Both then burbled northeastward, to emerge off the Outer Banks and briefly resurrected as tropical cyclones. Both then were captured by a stagnant jet stream.   
  
Both produced tremendous amounts of rain, with one slight difference. The Agnes remnant did it over an extensive area of the northeastern U.S., killing 122 people. Sixteen of these were in Washington, as normally torpid Rock Creek rose to the rooftops of cars on the adjacent Parkway in a matter of a few minutes. The U.S. Office of Emergency Management calls it “the most massive flooding in the history of the eastern United States.”   
  
Agnes did this while spinning a loop over land. The Hermine remnant is forecast to spin three, but out over the water, all the while chunking out tremendous amounts of rain. We can only hope this is true, because all that’s going to cause is a week of impressive winds and gigantic waves. If this happens onshore (or very near-shore)…we don’t even want to think about it.   
  
With regard to that Rorschach test, it should be duly noted that both the Ash Wednesday storm and Hurricane Agnes occurred during a time of global cooling. You don’t need global warming, and, because the Hermine remnant is going to mix away any unusually warm water very quickly, the real culprit will be the dumb luck of a weak hurricane intercepting a stalled jet stream.

I find it increasingly difficult to navigate my days with a settled countenance. There are three main things that I have to actively push to the back of my mind in order to reach sunset with some remaining degree of peace – blind acceptance of the validity of man-made climate change, wokeness, and our country being run by muppets. There are others, but they are my top three. What I am going to do when the cricket season finishes, I know not.



There is an endless supply of examples of each of the main irritants every day. Take yesterday.



The UK Court of appeal has ruled that Heathrow cannot build a third runway because to do so is not adequately taking into consideration the government’s commitment to tackle the ‘climate crisis’. This means the Court of Appeal has said that the Paris Accord is binding which is a very dangerous precedent. The Government will not appeal this (chickens) because it is a private matter (Heathrow is an independent company) and Heathrow will take it to the Supreme Court. Good luck with that. Even after Lady Hale’s departure the UK Supreme Court has an appalling track record in the unbiased department and I made my views on this political body plain a few months ago.



Taking this ruling away from an airport, the decision effectively **kneecaps government** in all sorts of places. You elect a Government, it makes a decision, some people don’t like it and they protest, they take it to Court and win and the Government is rendered useless. Ihumatau anyone?



A black woman, again in the UK, had her passport photo rejected by the Artificial Intelligence that scans such images because it thought her mouth was open. It was suggested that she could adjust the lighting of the shot but Ms Offended decided that the problem was that **the AI system was racist.** This, of course has garnered hundreds (thousands, gazillions – who cares?) of ‘likes’ on social media which seems to run the world at present. I await the apology (and how many of those have we had recently? Lianne Dalziel apologising in Japan for the Christchurch earthquake springs readily to mind) and the Twitterati win again.



 **Laurence Fox** was a breath of fresh air a couple of weeks back when he opined (on the BBC , no less) that the hounding of **Meghan Markle** was not racist. The sane world has a chance. **Nope.** Sgt. Hathaway has been beaten down by the Twitterati and has voluntarily suspended his Twitter account because he (genuinely, I assume) fears that he will not get work in sufficient volumes to feed his family. His union has campaigned to have him blacklisted from productions and Equity is a very powerful outfit.



Muppets with their hands on the levers of power; we don’t need to go overseas for the latest in a long line of examples here. You only have to see **Megan Woods** on Pravda One kitted out in a hard hat, hi viz vest and safety glasses and you know you are in for a couple of minutes of comedy gold. Transparency (and they are good at that, aren’t they) at filling stations will bring down petrol prices. Give me a break.

"The “Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme” which is now in Parliament, starts with a lie and goes downhill from there.
It is not about carbon or pollution. It aims to Ration and Tax man’s production of carbon dioxide (CO2), but it will have no benefits for the climate or the environment. It is better named “the RAT scheme”.
There is no human activity whatsoever that does not generate CO2, and no plant can grow without a generous supply of CO2 in the atmosphere. More than any other substance on earth, production of CO2 measures human prosperity and plant growth.
The RAT scheme thus plans to ration and tax human prosperity and plant growth. Never has a more destructive bill appeared in our Parliament.
Thank goodness we have some terriers in Parliament trying to kill this RAT.

Guest essay by Albert Parker*
Hopefully everybody remember Sallenger’s “hot spots” of sea level acceleration along the East Coast of the US.
Asbury H. Sallenger Jr, Kara S. Doran & Peter A. Howd, Hotspot of accelerated sea-level rise on the Atlantic coast of North America, Nature Climate Change 2, 884–888 (2012), doi:10.1038/nclimate1597
This was one of the many examples of bad science misinterpreting the sea level oscillations by cherry picking the time window.
As 6 more years of data have been collected, let see if the hotspots are now the “hottest on record” or if they have cooled down.
The logic of Sallenger & co. was based on the comparison of the rate of rise of sea levels over the first and second half of time windows of 60, 50 and 40 years, i.e. the comparison of the rate of rise over the first and the last 30, 25 and 20 years respectively of these 60, 50 and 40 years windows.
This did not make any sense to me, as if you do have sinusoidal oscillations of periodicity 60 years, positive and negative phases of 30 years, and you select the end of the time widows at the end of one positive phase, this way you will always have “positive acceleration” even if there is none, and everybody knew about periods and phasing of the natural oscillations.
The logic was clearly flawed, but obviously Nature did not accepted any comment. The science is settled, and can’t be discussed.
So, let see the data, for example for Washington DC and The Battery NY, to check if the hotspots have produced huge sea level rises since December 2009.
The figure below presents the MSL (monthly average mean sea levels) and the SLR computed with 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 years’ time windows for Washington DC and The Battery NY.
Is there any one able to spot any sign or acceleration or simply oscillations? With the data up to December 2009 and with the data up to April 2016, not a chance. There are only oscillations about same longer term trend.
Which is then the novelty of the last 6 years of data? Since December 2009, the sea levels have declined in both Washington DC and The Battery NY, -3.3 mm/year in Washington DC and -10.7 mm/year in The Battery NY.
It seems that immediately after December 2009, the last month of data considered by Sallenger & co. in their June 2012 paper, corrected online June 2013 with the publishing in the supplementary of the actual numbers, a positive phase of the oscillations has been replaced by a negative phase.

"The storm that devastated parts of the South over the weekend swept into the Northeast with strong gusts of wind and heavy rain, knocking down power lines and tree branches, flooding some coastal towns and disrupting transit across the region. By Tuesday morning, the worst of the storm had passed. The damage was significantly less than the storm’s southern passage, which left at least 20 people dead, including 15 in Georgia. On the Jersey Shore, flooding closed some roads in places like Wildwood, Atlantic City and Sea Bright. Photographs and videos shared on social media showed water pooling in and outside of the Hoboken Terminal. On the South Shore of Long Island, rain flooded the streets in Freeport and Lindenhurst. Some New Jersey school districts were closed or delayed opening on Tuesday because of the weather. In New York, small sections of the Belt Parkway, Van Wyck Expressway and   Expressway were flooded briefly. Power failures were reported in parts of Long Island, New Jersey, Staten Island and Queens. Wind speeds of more than 60 miles per hour in New Jersey and about 40 m. p. h. in New York prompted warnings from city officials on Monday, but the wind tapered significantly by Tuesday morning. The storm surge caused water to rise about     feet in New York, which officials described as mild. About 70 to 80 trees were blown down, said Nancy Silvestri, a spokeswoman for the New York City Emergency Management Department. “There are no major impacts from either last night’s high tide period or this morning,” Ms. Silvestri said. Residents from around the region spoke about the inconveniences and less about damage: The memory of hurricane Sandy, which caused a storm surge of more than 10 feet in places and left behind significantly more destruction, loomed larger. Sam Patel, owner of a Welsh Farms convenience store in Asbury Park, N. J. said the electricity went out a few times Monday night but came back on within five minutes. The wind also ripped off a piece of his storm gutter, which he refastened with tape. “All day the gusts were just like the classic hurricane type,” he said. “You could hear the rattling of the gutters, the hissing. ” What spared the area, he said, was that the rain was not particularly heavy. In Monmouth Beach, N. J. some flooded streets were blocked off with orange traffic cones. Tattered flags shook on flagpoles in a wind that had yet to fully dissipate on Tuesday morning. Toppled trash cans dotted main commercial streets. In Lindenhurst, Long Island, high tide peaked around 7:20 a. m. The canal used for crabbing and swimming in the summertime had overflowed into the road. Curbs disappeared under the pooled water. The six inches of floodwater did not reach the levels left by Hurricane Sandy, when “you could go kayaking in the streets,” said Darren Greene, 13, waiting for a bus to take him to school. He was not entirely confident about when, or if, the bus would come. The road had been blocked off just past the stop. Michael Gandolfi, his wife and their    son were stuck at home in Lindenhurst with about a foot of water in front of their house. So Mr. Gandolfi, 37, planned to use the day to play with his   boats. In the Red Hook neighborhood of Brooklyn, small bodies of water covered   roads. But the delivery crews, workers and early risers navigating the streets before dawn on Tuesday were not fazed. Alongside the loading docks of a Fairway Market grocery store, a pool of water formed the width of the street and about 50 yards long. “It’s like this any time it rains hard,” a Fairway employee said. A couple of drivers used a swath of the dry curb to pass, while a motorist in a   vehicle charged through the pool of water. Bruce Sullivan, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, described the storm on Monday as a “strong nor’easter,” because of the high winds and heavy rain. The storm had deposited between an inch and an inch and a half of rain by Tuesday morning. Passengers at the region’s three major airports had faced long delays and cancellations on Monday. The weather forced the suspension of AirTrain service at Newark Liberty International Airport on Monday buses ran in its place. New Jersey Transit and Amtrak temporarily suspended service along some lines on Monday because of downed power lines. Two   systems contributed to the storm, Mr. Sullivan said. One, from the south, was weakening as another moved in from off the coast of the Delmarva Peninsula."
"Everyone is relieved that we are only getting a 5% carbon tax penalty with lots of refunds, exemptions and electoral bribes.
This is the worst possible outcome. 
Better they stayed at 25% tax, which would have provoked such a revolt that even the Liberals would have objected. The whole thing would then have been abandoned at the first opportunity.
But this sneaky Fabian tax will get onto the books and we will all be trained to submit annual returns to the Greenhouse office. Then later, exemptions will be abandoned, the tax will become a permanent feature of the mess called the Australian Tax “System”, and 5% will creep to 10%, to 20%, where they wanted it in the first place. 
Meanwhile, climate change will continue regardless.
And those looking forward to their Green subsidies and handouts need to remember:
“The benefit you get from Canberra is the tax you sent to Canberra, less bureaucratic charges both ways”.

Guest Post by Willis Eschenbach
I’ve spent a good chunk of my life around, on, and under the ocean. I worked seasonally for many years as a commercial fisherman off of the western coast of the US. I’ve frozen off my begonias setting nets in driving sleet up in the Bering Sea. I’m also a blue-water sailor with a Pacific crossing under my belt, and a surfer, and both a sport and a commercial diver.
Plus I’m eternally curious, so I have read about and studied the ocean all my life.
Based on both my experience and my knowledge, I have written a number of posts regarding what I see as the astounding responsiveness and adaptability of the creatures that live in the ocean (links below). I’ve said repeatedly that the minor neutralization of the oceans due to more atmospheric CO2 was meaningless, that the oceanic creatures would not be bothered by such a change.
So I laughed out loud when I saw the latest study in Science magazine, which involves coccolithophores. These are calcifying plants, which form the most delicate and intricate skeletons out of calcium carbonate which they precipitate from the seawater.
Coccolithophore. Image Source
Puts me in mind of the old song, “A wheel in a wheel, way up in the middle of the air”. Beautiful.
The study says that coccolithophore abundance in the North Atlantic has increased by about ten-fold in recent years. In other words, instead of finding coccolithophores in ~ 2% of their plankton trawls, they now find them in about 20% of the trawls. They did a multi-variable analysis, and their conclusion was that increases in CO2 are a main cause of the increase in coccolithophore abundance. The study is entitled “Multidecadal increase in North Atlantic coccolithophores and the potential role of rising CO2”, paywalled here.
This study is important because the state of the ocean is one of the latest targets of the serially failed climate doomcasters. The alarmists’ claim is that the slight neutralization of the ocean will make it harder for calcifying organisms to form their calcium shells, substrates, and skeletons. However, the study shows that for coccolithophores, this is not the case. From the magazine:
Passing an acid test
Calcifying marine organisms will generally find it harder to make and maintain their carbonate skeletons as increasing concentrations of atmospheric CO2 acidify the oceans. Nevertheless, some types of organisms will be damaged more than others, and some may even benefit from higher CO2 levels. Coccolithophores are a case in point, because their photosynthetic ability is strongly carbon-limited. Rivero-Calle et al. show that the abundance of coccolithophores in the North Atlantic has increased by up to 20% or more in the past 50 years (see the Perspective by Vogt). Thus, this major phytoplankton functional group may be able to adapt to a future with higher CO2 concentrations.
Science, this issue p. 1533; see also p. 1466
Abstract
As anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions acidify the oceans, calcifiers generally are expected to be negatively affected. However, using data from the Continuous Plankton Recorder, we show that coccolithophore occurrence in the North Atlantic increased from ~2 to more than 20% from 1965 through 2010. We used random forest models to examine more than 20 possible environmental drivers of this change, finding that CO2 and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation were the best predictors, leading us to hypothesize that higher CO2 levels might be encouraging growth. A compilation of 41 independent laboratory studies supports our hypothesis. Our study shows a long-term basin-scale increase in coccolithophores and suggests that increasing CO2 and temperature have accelerated the growth of a phytoplankton group that is important for carbon cycling.
I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again. Regarding the ocean I have a rule of thumb;
In the ocean, chemistry doesn’t rule life—instead, life rules chemistry
And this rule of thumb has a corollary:
Life is sneaky and will find a way to grow through stone
This is a perfect example. Life has a habit of making chemical reactions go in unexpected directions and at speeds unseen anywhere outside of living creatures. Despite the chemical reality of increased CO2 making the precipitation of CaCO3 slightly harder, the coccolithophores pay little attention to how steep the energetic hill is. They just keep cranking, and in this case, even speed up.
I find this very important because according to the study, coccolithophores are estimated to be responsible for about half of all precipitation of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) in the ocean. Half. That’s a lot.
And following that chain of effects to its next logical step, the rate at which CO2 is precipitated from the ocean as CaCO3 has an effect on the amount of neutralization of the ocean due to increased atmospheric CO2.
Paraphrasing Mark Twain, my conclusion is that the rumors of the oceans’ death from increased CO2 are greatly exaggerated.
My best wishes to all of you,

My Other Request: If you think that e.g. I’m using the wrong method on the wrong dataset, please educate me and others by demonstrating the proper use of the right method on the right dataset. Simply claiming I’m wrong doesn’t advance the discussion.

Guest essay by Eric Worrall
Climate worriers appear to be increasingly looking for ways to exploit people’s religious faith, to coerce ordinary people into accepting green destitution; into abandoning mechanised transport, into letting farmland return to wilderness.
Can imams drive action on climate change in Pakistan?
Imams and other religious leaders are an under-used means of pushing action to combat climate change, experts and religious scholars say.
Religious leaders have the moral standing to call on people and businesses to consider the environmental impact of their activities and take a bigger role in reducing their own carbon footprints and finding ways to cope with the growing impacts of climate change, experts said at a multi-faith meeting in Islamabad.
Maulana Tahir Ashrafi, central chairman of the Pakistan Ulema Council – the country’s council of religious scholars – told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that imams in Pakistan could have “unprecedented influence” in bringing action on climate change.
But first, he said, they need training to both understand and communicate the issues accurately in a country hard-hit by climate-related drought, flooding, crop losses and other problems.
“We religious leaders in Pakistan can talk about climate change with people as long as we become knowledgeable about climate change and its other facets,” he said.
At the recent gathering, which drew scientists, religious scholars and academics, Charles Amjad, an American professor emeritus at the Luther Seminary in Minnesota, said relying only on political and non-governmental organisation leaders to drive climate action was a mistaken approach.
“We must realise that people do listen to religious scholars in mosques, priests in churches, rabbis in synagogues and pundits in Hindu temples in most developing countries, far more than they do to politicians, bureaucrats, media and mayors,” he said.
“This power of faith activists must be tapped for addressing climate change,” he urged.

For much of the history of civilisation, during the Dark Age, ordinary people were prey to the unscrupulous – to tyrants who exploited the honest faith of ordinary people, to coerce acceptance of inequity and injustice. Then along came the Age of Reason, and the Age of Enlightenment. Instead of simply accepting whatever they were told, ordinary people started to question, to demand answers, to know the evidence. People started to demand rational government, justice, liberty and fair treatment.
The Climate activist appeal to reason has failed – their evidence sucks, their models don’t work, public interest is plummeting, and their habit of calling people names, when their shoddy science is questioned, is starting to wear thin.
The obvious, if audacious solution – roll back the clock, and restore the Dark Age of unquestioning obedience to arbitrary authority.

As [recently reported on _The BFD_](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/02/more-finger-wagging-globalist-garbage-from-helen-clark/) New Zealand’s very own Duchess of Globalist Elitism, **Helen Clark** , has published a new report just chock-full of the sort of finger-wagging wokescolding that UN cronies specialise in.



Coming from the UN and Clark, the report is short on objective facts but very, very long on subjective fluff about “flourishing”, and just brim-full of fishwife nagging. Naturally, of course, well-off, safe, peaceful Western nations like Australia come in for particular harsh censure, ranking just 174th out of 180 on her “Sustainability Index”.



So, just which countries does Her Royal Wokeness **really** admire?



Coming in at number one is the **real** Happiest Place on Earth. No, not Disneyland!… **Burundi**.



Burundi is best known as a free-fire slaughter zone where Tutsis and Hutus take turns genociding each other.



Still, if you are able to survive machete-armed gangs, starvation and poverty, you’ll have the massive ­advantage of living (briefly) amid sustainable carbon dioxide levels.



Next up on Helen’s Global Index of Wokeness is the only country named after a fratlord, but with noticeably less beer or babes… **Chad**.



Chad is celebrated for its colourful traditions of disease, corruption and ­female genital mutilation.



But with its low, low carbon dioxide output, Chad is 172 countries better than awful Australia.



Boy, you’d think Lady Clark is setting the bar low, there, but at least Chad came in just ahead of… **Somalia**.



Children were big news last month in the UN’s third-placed sustainability wonderland. **Mohammed Dhaysane** reported:



“At least three children between the ages of 4 and 6 died from hunger and disease in Mogadishu’s Kahda neighbourhood internally displaced camps Friday […]



“‘Our life here is miserable, today at least three children died because diseases, hunger and malnutrition and no one cares about us,’ **Fadimo Hassan** , a mother in one of the camps told Anadolu Agency.”



Cheer up, Fadimo. You’re living in the UN’s third-best place on earth.



Nothing quite fires up New Zealand’s globalist Marie Antoinette than the issue of women’s rights. Why, in patriarchal hell-hole Australia, girls only lead boys in education results, life expectancy, mental health, likelihood **not** to commit suicide or be murdered…



Unlike that feminist paradise…the **Democratic Republic of the Congo**.



Sure, it might be the rape capital of the world, but don’t let that minor blemish blind you to the DRC’s impressively low and totally non-shameful emissions output.



And even if you can only expect to live for just 60 years or so, that merely means you’re doing your bit to keep emissions from ever reaching dangerous Australian levels.



Rounding up the Top Five Paradises-on-Earth and making it a quinella of sustainability and flourishing for Africa, is the **Central African Republic**.



Proudly among the ten poorest nations on earth, which is their way of preventing future sustainability issues, the Central African Republic is somehow considered by a recent study to be the worst country in the world for young people.



This must be a mistake, because Australia has “lost its way” and is “shameful” on account of our emissions and all.



 **Such is the world according to the mindset of Helen Clark and her globalist cronies.** Which is certainly not the world of thee and me. But then, we can’t afford to worry so much about climate change that we have to sacrifice everything to constantly jet about the world from luxury resort to luxury resort.



The UN really should compose a hypocrisy index.

 **Pauline Hanson** , bless her fiery locks, [has a way of throwing spanners](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/09/the-left-hate-pauline-hanson-for-being-right/) into the smugly well-oiled machine of the left-media elite. When she wore a burqa into parliament, for example, she effortlessly highlighted the hypocrisy and pomposity of the political-media class. Leftist elites clutch their pearls, but many Quiet Australians across the vast darkness of suburbia and the regions silently nod their heads in agreement.



Hanson’s latest move is sure to have inner-city worthies spitting up their skinny almond-milk lattes, and will almost certainly be voted down, even by so-called “conservatives”. But it is one that will strike a chord with many ordinary Australians who are sick to death of seeing their kids’ schools turned into left-wing indoctrination camps.



The One Nation leader will be tabling a private senator’s bill today to stop teachers indoctrinating students with what she calls “unsubstantiated human-induced climate change and gender fluidity”.



Pauline Hanson: “What the teachers are teaching our kids in school is about life’s experiences, sexting, about historical evidence, about politics, about climate change – all these things that I think [is] teachers putting their own opinions to it, and it’s not really based on science and it’s not based on what’s true.”



Radio commentator **Neil Mitchell** , despite agreeing with Hanson that teachers are indoctrinating, is apparently unable to countenance backing her proposal.



Neil Mitchell: “I think at times they are [being indoctrinated], but what are we going to do, teach them from the Book of Hanson?”



This is something of a straw-man argument. Hanson isn’t asking for her, or anyone else’s, views to be given primacy. What she is asking is the perfectly reasonable demand that nonsensical junk ideology, like “gender theory”, be scrubbed from the curriculum. Mitchell is somewhat right that “balance” is a subjective idea, but it is plain to anyone who isn’t rabid leftist that teaching has become hopelessly biased.



Parents are well aware of this. There are stories of frustrated parents pulling their children from schools rather than put up with a non-stop barrage of climate change and rainbow propaganda.



“Children are easy targets of all sorts of false and left-leaning teachings and parents have had a gut full of seeing the people they entrust with teaching their children, pushing their own agendas,” Senator Hanson said.



“Children should be given balanced information, including views about political, historic and scientific matters, and they should be very strongly encouraged to think critically about what they are told and learn to make up their own informed views.



“When children graduate from school, they need skills in historic research and scientific thinking, which will support them throughout their lives.”



The Prohibiting the Indoctrination of Children Bill would counteract a wide range of issues described as indoctrination of young children: including skewed versions of history taught as fact, controversial sexual programs that teach gender fluidity and realignment to infants, unsubstantiated human-induced climate change, as well as the teachings of so-called “safe” underage sex, sexting, and non-traditional sex.



“The Bill recognises parents across Australia who have concerns about biased teachings, they don’t like the teaching of non-traditional and controversial views that don’t give the full picture; they want to protect and strengthen their children, and this Bill does that,” Senator Hanson said.



“Parents want a sensible curriculum that sets their children up for meaningful, employable futures, without the distraction of false or imbalanced ideology.”



Australian taxpayers are also noticing that, despite spending ever-more-vast amounts of money, [Australian education standards are plummeting](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-11-30/australia-declines-in-global-education-report/8077474).



Australian kids might not be able to read, but they know how to count imaginary genders. They can barely manage basic maths, but they can tuck their penises, strap their breasts, and write sex personals. They can’t tell a XX from an XY, but they [live in constant terror](https://www.kidsnews.com.au/environment/survey-finds-australian-children-are-anxious-about-the-environment-and-plastic-waste/news-story/f3f24ad6c6d761b4bc98000b92e3857f) of an imaginary sky dragon.



This is the gangrenous green dream for Australia’s future: dumb as a box of rocks but woke as.

The Obama administration’s latest, greatest weapon to prosecute its war on global warming is something called the “social cost of carbon.” It is an instrument honed on ill‐​founded climate alarm and is readily blunted in the face of the best science.



The social cost of carbon is supposed to be a complete accounting of the market externalizes, both positive and negative, resulting from carbon dioxide emissions released by burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, or natural gas.





In its pursuit of a high social cost of carbon the administration is going further down a path that is divergent from the one paved by the very best science on the issue.



But as its name implies, the government’s accounting of the social cost of carbon focuses almost entirely on conjured “costs” while ignoring proven “benefits” of carbon dioxide emissions.



The administration has determined that each ton of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere today from human activities leads to a future cost to global society of about $40 (in today’s dollars).



This assigned $40 premium on carbon dioxide emissions proves to be a powerful sword that the administration has been wielding to slash the apparent costs of a flurry of proposed new rules and regulations aimed at reducing emissions.



Here’s how it works: any new proposed regulation viewed as reducing future carbon dioxide emissions gets a cost credit for each ton of reduced emissions equivalent to the value of the social cost of carbon. That credit is then used to offset the true costs.



In this way, all qualifying rules and regulations, including the EPA’s promised emissions limits on new and existing power plants, appear less costly — a critical asset, as costs are often the greatest barrier to approval.



Since the war on global warming is a high priority within the Obama administration, finding ways to make the social cost of carbon appear to be as high as possible is the ongoing objective.



Back in May, the administration increased its previous estimate by more than 50%, from $25 to $40, which means that all proposed carbon dioxide emissions cuts are now some 50% more valuable.



But that increase doesn’t jibe with science. In fact, in its pursuit of a high social cost of carbon the administration is going further down a path that is divergent from the one paved by the very best science on the issue.



For example, its new estimate completely ignores a large and growing body of scientific evidence that suggests that the Earth’s climate is much less sensitive to carbon dioxide emissions than the administration assumed.



This means that carbon dioxide emissions result in less global warming, less sea level rise, and less overall climate impact than previously thought.



In other words, the social “costs” that may result from human‐​caused climate change are substantially, some 33%, less than those in the administration’s calculation.



Another important point largely ignored by the current administration is that there are “benefits” in addition to the “costs” of carbon dioxide emissions.



One of the key benefits is enhanced global food production. Carbon dioxide is a fertilizer for plants, and more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere means stronger, healthier, and more productive vegetation, including most crops — a fact established by literally thousands of scientific studies.



A new analysis by Dr. Craig Idso of the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change estimates that over the last 50 years, the value of global food production has increased by $3.2 trillion as a result of our carbon dioxide emissions.



The handling of this large, significant and proven benefit from carbon dioxide is grossly deficient in the administration’s accounting of the social cost of carbon.



Had the new science on the Earth’s climate sensitivity to carbon dioxide, the science on carbon dioxide’s role as a plant fertilizer, and other critical issues not been largely ignored, the administration’s latest estimate of the social cost of carbon would have dropped to near zero, or perhaps actually become negative.



A proper accounting of the social cost of carbon would have sheathed the administration’s blade, or even turned it upon itself, as Congress and the American people would see the true cost of the regulations being imposed on them, and the president’s climate war effort would be eviscerated for lack of alarm.

“People’s sliding and having fun in snow (Muree, Pakistan)” by Noman Ahmed Awan – Own work. Licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0 via Wikimedia Commons.
Guest essay by Eric Worrall
Journalists in Pakistan have condemned government inaction with respect to climate change, which they blame for unusually harsh winter weather, and heavy snowfall.
According to The Express Tribune;
Swept under the carpet: Climate change remains little-known threat in K-P
PESHAWAR:
Climate change is a subject that is not widely discussed in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa even though spending in this regard has increased by 88% over the last four years from Rs13 billion to Rs24.4 billion.
While this matter is brushed under the carpet, weather anomalies under the El Nino effect have drastically increased. Through this phenomenon, when the surface temperature in the Pacific Ocean rises, more rain and snowfall is expected in winter.
The effects of this phenomenon are likely to grow manifold in 2016.
However, this has not encouraged officials of the provincial government to put their heads together and come up with a workable strategy to address the effects of climate change.
…
Implications
Winter has become particularly harsh and the precipitation levels have also been affected.
Snowfall that was expected in February began in November. Erratic patterns of rainfall have caused flooding. This has resulted in a considerable loss to life in urban areas and dealt a heavy blow to the provincial exchequer.
According to estimates, each spell of rain in urban areas across the province has resulted in the death of at least three people.
Floods triggered by the glacial lake outburst phenomena (GLOF) phenomenon have killed more than 90 people across Malakand Division. And yet, there are a series of doubts as to what has caused these events.

Here I was thinking that the Himalayas were melting away. Luckily journalists on the scene have corrected this misapprehension, and helped us to understand that global warming causes harsher winters and a massive increase in snow accumulation. Though placing the blame on local politicians seems a bit unfair – perhaps the politicians are simply holding back, keeping their UN climate money safely deposited somewhere on behalf of the public, until next year, when global warming will cause the end of snow.

"WASHINGTON  —   Democrats continue their rigorous questioning of President Trump’s nominees for cabinet positions and other important posts. Here are key moments from today: ■ Representative Tom Price of Georgia, nominated to be health and human services secretary, defended his investments in an Australian pharmaceutical company during his time in Congress. “The reality is that everything that I did was ethical, above board, legal and transparent,” he said. ■ Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, lamented “the   of the nomination process. ” ■ Representative Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, the nominee for budget director, said that tackling government waste and reducing debt would be his top priorities. ■ The toughest questions that Mr. Mulvaney faced on Tuesday came from Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona. He asked Mr. Mulvaney about his record of voting for cuts to military spending and appeared to be shocked when Mr. Mulvaney could not remember those votes. ■ Linda E. McMahon, the former chief executive of World Wrestling Entertainment and Mr. Trump’s choice to lead the Small Business Administration, said her entrepreneurial background suited her for the job. ■ Ms. McMahon assured senators that she would be a vigilant opponent of restrictive government regulations. A background investigation of Mr. Price says he understated the value of his investments in an Australian pharmaceutical company, Innate Immunotherapeutics, and claimed income tax deductions that he could not substantiate. The findings emerged from a review of Mr. Price’s tax returns and other official documents by committee staff members from both parties. In a questionnaire in December, the committee staff said, Mr. Price understated the value of 400, 613 shares of the Australian company that he purchased in August 2016 through “a private placement offering. ” The value of the shares was listed on the questionnaire as $50, 000 to $100, 000, but that reflected the purchase price, the staff reported. At the request of the committee, Mr. Price recalculated the value of his holdings to reflect their market price. The revised value was $100, 000 to $250, 000. In addition, the committee staff said, Mr. Price “took improper deductions on his 2016 tax returns” for the depreciation of land associated with condominiums that he owns in Washington and Nashville. Moreover, the staff said, Mr. Price and his wife, both physicians, claimed “miscellaneous employment deductions totaling $19, 034” for various expenses in 2013, 2014 and 2015. Neither Mr. Price nor his wife work as a physician, the staff report said, and “proper documentation could not be located,” so Mr. Price’s tax returns will be amended to remove the $19, 034 in deductions. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee, questioned Mr. Price over his trades of health care stocks during his time in Congress. “It is hard to see this as anything but a conflict of interest and an abuse of position,” Mr. Wyden said. In particular, Mr. Wyden pressed Mr. Price over his investments in Innate Immunotherapeutics, which the senator said could be affected by legislation that comes before Congress. Mr. Price said he had done nothing wrong. “The reality is that everything that I did was ethical, above board, legal and transparent,” he said. Just how involved is Mr. Price as the Trump administration plots how it will replace the Affordable Care Act? Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, tried to find out. “President Trump said he’s working with you on a replacement plan for the A. C. A. which is nearly finished and will be revealed after your confirmation,” Mr. Brown said. “Is that true?” “It’s true that he said that, yes,” Mr. Price responded, drawing laughter in the hearing room. “Not that he’s ever done this before, but did the president lie?” Mr. Brown asked. He added: “I know we don’t use the word lie here, because we’re polite, when presidents say statements that aren’t true. But did he lie to the public about working with you?” “I’ve had conversations with the president about health care, yes,” Mr. Price replied. Senator Hatch lamented “the   of the nomination process. ” He said Democrats’ attacks on Mr. Price’s ethics were “specious and distorted. ” He said lawmakers should not “invent new standards for finances, ethics and disclosure that are different from those that have generally applied in the past. ” “None of those who say they oppose Dr. Price’s nomination seem to be talking about whether he is qualified,” Mr. Hatch said. Senator Johnny Isakson, Republican of Georgia, also came to Mr. Price’s defense. “I feel like I’ve been asked to be a character witness in a felony trial in the sentencing phase of a conviction,” he said. He called Mr. Price “an honorable man. ” Mr. Mulvaney said that tackling government waste and reducing debt would be his top priorities if he were confirmed as Mr. Trump’s budget director. “I believe, as a matter of principle, that the debt is a problem that must be addressed sooner rather than later,” Mr. Mulvaney said in prepared remarks to be delivered to the Senate Budget Committee. “I also know that fundamental changes are needed in the way Washington spends and taxes if we truly want a healthy economy. ” While Mr. Mulvaney is a big believer in spending cuts, he made it clear that he wanted to protect America’s social safety nets. “A strong, healthy economy allows us to protect our most vulnerable,” he said. Mr. Mulvaney was asked about his failure to pay nanny taxes in his opening question, and said that it had been an innocent mistake. “In 2000, we had triplets. When we came home, we hired someone to help my wife, to help take care of the children,” Mr. Mulvaney said. “In my mind, she was a babysitter. ” He added, “I did not consider her a household employee for purposes of withholding. ” Mr. Mulvaney said he had realized his error when filling out a questionnaire related to his nomination to be Mr. Trump’s budget director. He said that he had quickly notified his accountant, the president and his colleagues so that he could correct the mistake. The toughest questions Mr. Mulvaney faced on Tuesday came not from a Democrat but from Senator McCain. He asked Mr. Mulvaney about his record of voting for cuts to military spending, and appeared shocked when he could not remember those votes. “Boy, I’ll tell you, I would remember if I voted to cut our defenses the way you did, congressman,” Mr. McCain said. “Maybe you don’t take it with the seriousness that it deserves. ” Mr. McCain was also unimpressed with Mr. Mulvaney’s explanation for wanting to withdraw all troops from Afghanistan. After giving the congressman a history lesson on the roots of the Sept. 11 attacks, he offered a final note of disapproval. “I am deeply concerned about your lack of support for our military,” he said. Mr. Mulvaney was forced to address suggestions he had made in the past that Social Security was akin to a Ponzi scheme, and he played down that characterization. “I wouldn’t read too much into it, as describing it as a Ponzi scheme,” he said, explaining that he had merely been referring to the fact that the program takes money from people and gives it to other people. As for keeping the program solvent, Mr. Mulvaney said he would not recommend cuts that would cause current retirees to lose benefits. However, he said that he could see raising the age for receiving benefits in the future. Ms. McMahon reassured senators that she would be a vigilant opponent of restrictive government regulations, promising to work to put in place “the right regulations” to spur economic growth if she is confirmed as head of the Small Business Administration. Senator Jim Risch, the Idaho Republican who leads the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, said the regulatory structure of government today was “strangling businesses. ” Ms. McMahon presented herself not as the billionaire former chief executive of W. W. E. but instead as an entrepreneur who had weathered the most difficult moments of building a business from the ground up. “Small businesses want to feel they can take a risk on expansion or a new hire without fearing onerous new regulations or unexpected taxes, fees and fines that will make such growth unaffordable,” she said. “We want to renew optimism in our economy. ” Ms. McMahon described how she and her husband, Vince, built their global business enterprise from an operation so small they shared a desk. She spoke of how they fought back from an early bankruptcy filing  —   a stark contrast to the wealthy former executive she is today. The McMahons were among Mr. Trump’s biggest campaign donors, having given $6 million to a “super PAC” supporting him last August and September. Ms. McMahon and Mr. Trump go back decades, bound by their shared background in entertainment. The Trump Plaza in Atlantic City hosted the W. W. E. ’s WrestleMania twice in the late 1980s, according to Mr. Trump’s W. W. E. “Superstars” bio, and Mr. Trump became a frequent attendee at the entertainment empire’s events. In 2007, he shaved Mr. McMahon’s head in the wrestling ring after winning a   Battle of the Billionaires wager. Introduced and endorsed by the two Democrats who defeated her in her failed Senate bids in Connecticut  —   Senators Richard Blumenthal and Christopher S. Murphy  —   Ms. McMahon seems likely to sail to confirmation, with the committee expected to approve her next week. The introduction and endorsement of a Republican nominee by two Democratic senators is unusual at the outset of a confirmation hearing. Mr. Murphy, who defeated Ms. McMahon in 2012, expressed “confidence that she is going to give good, sound counsel to President Trump. ” “I saw firsthand the fight that Linda brings to any endeavor she takes on,” he said."

The forecast is still some 10 days out, and so there’s still a possibility it’ll change. But the overall pattern appears to be in the works, the meteorologists say.

Jung writes:
As the chart above shows, very cold air flows in to us here in Germany from high up. That would put us somewhat below freezing also in the daytime in many regions.
This scenario has been popping up in the weather model calculations for a few days, and so we should take it very seriously.”

Green energy refugees?
And with Europe’s power supply system as rickety and unstable as it is, thanks to crappy, wildly fluctuating wind and sun, it may be a wise idea for Europeans to have emergency sources of heat or electricity ready just in case the long anticipated blackout does occur – and is more likely during a period of protracted cold. I’ve been contemplating buying a small generator in order to power our natural gas furnace so that the house will at least have heat and warm water. The gas furnace needs electricity to operate.
Snowfall, long-term cold, and the resulting high power demands could challenge the power grid. Though the chances of a widespread blackout are small, it can no longer be ignored. Even the German government recently warned of the possibility. The DEUTSCHE WIRTSCHAFTS NACHRICHTEN here wrote earlier this year:
Also the President of the Federal Office of Citizens Protection, Christoph Unger, said: ‘The long-lasting, widespread power outage is for us the central challenge that we face.'”
Green energy refugees?
But there’s no need for Germans or Europeans to panic. There will always be warm places to take refuge. Yet it is unusual that we now need to prepare for the first green energy refugees – right here in “modern” Europe!
Not only Europe needs to brace for the coming cold, Bastardi also warns that Arctic air will push across North America and that there’s a real possibility of the weather turning “wickedly cold” over far east Asia. Winter has only just begun.

"**Hong Kong's police watchdog has largely exonerated officers for their handling of democracy protests last year.**
The report said officers had acted within guidelines but called for a review of the use of tear gas.
It criticised demonstrators for complaining about police brutality while ignoring their own wrongdoing.
The report has been welcomed by the territory's leader, Carrie Lam, but the opposition and human rights groups have dismissed it as a whitewash.
The protests started last June against plans to allow extradition to mainland China, but developed into a broader call for political change.
Clashes between police and activists became increasingly violent, with police firing live bullets and protesters attacking officers and throwing petrol bombs.
The highly-anticipated report by the Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC) also found no evidence of police collusion with gang members during a 21 July mob attack at a train station in Yuen Long district.
Opposition lawmakers say police inaction allowed criminals to beat up peaceful demonstrators after a rally.
Armed masked men - dressed in white shirts and suspected to be triad gangsters - assaulted pro-democracy protesters and passers-by in the area.
The IPCC did not address allegations of misconduct against individual officers during months of unrest, during which more than 8,000 protestors were arrested.
It said accusations of police brutality must not be used as ""a weapon of political protest"".
Responding to the report, pro-democracy protesters and politicians said the IPCC had turned a blind eye, and insisted on an independent inquiry led by judges.
""Those who wrote this report, they simply chose to look the other way,"" said pro-democracy legislator Claudia Mo.
""That's why we have been adamant about our demand that there has to be a proper, genuine, independent inquiry into all this police brutality that's been so blatant, so transparent in Hong Kong.""
An international panel of experts resigned from their roles as advisers to the IPCC last year, saying the body did not have the capacity to conduct a proper investigation.
But Carrie Lam insisted that the IPCC was capable of conducting an independent investigation, and has rejected calls for an independent enquiry."
"The UK government recently pledged to bring forward a ban on new diesel and petrol car sales from 2040, to 2035. The move surprised some, but perhaps most surprising was the confirmation that the ban will also include hybrid vehicles, which use a combustion engine running on fossil fuel and an electric battery pack. You might have taken the noise and fumes for granted at roadsides, but the ban would mean that petrol and diesel fuel is eliminated from new passenger vehicles within 15 years. This would have obvious benefits for reducing carbon emissions and improving air quality, but there are significant obstacles for the UK’s car industry to overcome in the meantime.  In 2019, only 1.6% of new passenger vehicles sold were electric vehicles, but they will need to form the majority of sales from 2035. So how can the next decade and a half set Britain on track for zero-carbon car travel?

      Cars will change more in the next decade than they have in the past century


 When it comes to designing and building petrol and diesel powered vehicles, the UK has a wealth of talent and expertise. In 2018, the UK produced 2.72 million engines and was the fourth largest car manufacturing country in the EU by total vehicles produced.  If the UK is to retain or grow this £82 billion industry in 2035, much of the existing workforce will need to be retrained in making electric vehicles. A wave of engineering graduates with expertise in electric and autonomous vehicles will also be needed to develop the next generation of electric vehicles. The good news is that universities and start-ups in the UK are behind world-leading research into new battery technologies. There’s more than one way to power an electric car, and these batteries come in a dizzying variety, from solid-state electrolyte batteries, low cost sodium-ion batteries, and lithium-air batteries which can store much more energy than conventional lithium-ion batteries.  The government is investing £274 million in battery research and manufacturing over four years through the Faraday Challenge. But investment will have to continue well after that to ensure these technologies make the difficult transition from prototype to mass production. All those electric vehicles will need charging points too, and their increased electricity demand on the national grid will need to be met by renewables. That could amount to over 80 terawatt hours (TWh) – increasing demand by a quarter. New solar farms and wind turbines will need to be built, along with new power lines, substations and rapid charging networks to distribute the electricity. If all of this is to be in place by 2035, action and investment is needed almost immediately. Many electric cars run on lithium-ion batteries, which start to age and lose the amount of electricity they can store from the moment they’re made. This is not so much of a problem in our phones, which have small batteries and are replaced every few years. But when it comes to electric vehicles, the battery pack is typically the most expensive part of the vehicle.  In 2017, the average lifetime of an electric vehicle battery pack was eight years, and only 10-50% of it could be recycled. Targets for 2035 are to have battery packs that last 15 years and are 95% recyclable. Researchers will need to improve the design of these batteries and the cars themselves to achieve this, while the government will have to build facilities that can recycle batteries, separating the raw materials – lithium, cobalt, nickel and carbon – so that they can be reused in the next generation of batteries.

      Lithium is finite – but clean technology relies on such non-renewable resources


 Battery electric vehicles aren’t the only solution. Hydrogen fuel cells combine hydrogen and oxygen from the air to produce water, generating electricity. If the hydrogen fuel is produced through electrolysis using renewable energy, then the process can have net zero CO₂ emissions.  Hydrogen fuels cells are less energy efficient than batteries, but the compressed hydrogen tank can be refuelled in less than five minutes and in a similar way to refuelling a petrol or diesel car. This makes hydrogen ideal for vehicles that undertake repeated long-distance journeys and are currently limited by the range and charging times of battery vehicles, such as taxis and transit vans. Lorries and buses aren’t covered in the 2035 ban, but hydrogen is also an ideal alternative fuel for them. London has eight hydrogen buses, but there are just 17 hydrogen refuelling stations in the UK, compared with 15,000 electric vehicle charging points. A hydrogen refuelling network is urgently needed to help decarbonise the parts of the UK’s transport network that is hard for electric vehicles to reach. The common theme across all of these points is investment. If the UK government really intends to meet its ambitious new target, then it will need to invest heavily and soon. If done right, this could reignite the automotive industry and position the UK as a world leader in electric vehicle production. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter.

"Your article about e-scooters (UK rides the wave of micromobility by embracing e-scooters, 25 August) failed to raise some vital questions. As electric scooters can cost as little as £120, they could provide the ideal transport for low-income commuters, while helping to reduce carbon emissions, especially in cities. It would not cost much to mark out a lane on arterial roads for the use of bicycles and e-scooters.  Why is the government not investing in the production of e-scooters; requiring supermarkets and workplaces to provide secure lockers for them, and encouraging employers to offer loans to enable employees to purchase e-scooters? Why is it only legal in Britain to use a rented e-scooter in designated local trials, especially when sharing them carries a risk of contracting Covid-19? And why is the government allowing Lime, a Silicon Valley startup, to dominate the new e-scooter rental market? As president of the delayed climate summit Cop26, Britain is supposed to be demonstrating climate leadership. Let’s embrace this opportunity. Hilary Saunders Bristol"

Guest essay by Eric Worrall
A new research paper claims that the Antarctic Ocean is staying cold, because it receives large infusions of “old water”, water which has been sitting in the freezing cold ocean depths since before the start of the machine age.
Antarctic Ocean Climate Change Mystery Could Be Explained By Deep, Old Water
A new study suggests that the Antarctic Ocean has remained unaffected by climate change and global warming due to deep, old water that is continually pulled to the surface.
A new University of Washington study reveals why the Antarctic Ocean might be one of the last places to experience the effects of global warming and human-driven climate change.
Over the years, the water surrounding Antarctica has stayed roughly the same temperature even as the rest of the planet continues to warm, a fact often pointed out by climate change deniers.
Now, a new study uses observations and climate models to suggest that the reason for this inconsistency is due to the unique currents around Antarctica that continually pull deep, old water up to the surface. This ancient water hasn’t touched the Earth’s surface since before the machine age, meaning it has been hidden from human-driven climate change.
“With rising carbon dioxide you would expect more warming at both poles, but we only see it at one of the poles, so something else must be going on,” said Kyle Armour of the University of Washington and lead author of the study. “We show that it’s for really simple reasons, and ocean currents are the hero here.”

The abstract of the study;
Southern Ocean warming delayed by circumpolar upwelling and equatorward transport
The Southern Ocean has shown little warming over recent decades, in stark contrast to the rapid warming observed in the Arctic. Along the northern flank of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, however, the upper ocean has warmed substantially. Here we present analyses of oceanographic observations and general circulation model simulations showing that these patterns—of delayed warming south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and enhanced warming to the north—are fundamentally shaped by the Southern Ocean’s meridional overturning circulation: wind-driven upwelling of unmodified water from depth damps warming around Antarctica; greenhouse gas-induced surface heat uptake is largely balanced by anomalous northward heat transport associated with the equatorward flow of surface waters; and heat is preferentially stored where surface waters are subducted to the north. Further, these processes are primarily due to passive advection of the anomalous warming signal by climatological ocean currents; changes in ocean circulation are secondary. These findings suggest the Southern Ocean responds to greenhouse gas forcing on the centennial, or longer, timescale over which the deep ocean waters that are upwelled to the surface are warmed themselves. It is against this background of gradual warming that multidecadal Southern Ocean temperature trends must be understood.

The world’s oceans contain enough cold water to quench any imaginable anthropogenic global warming for hundreds, more likely thousands of years. If that deep water is upwelling around Antarctica, keeping the Southern Ocean cold, it is difficult to see how significant global warming can occur, or significant Antarctic contribution to sea level rise can occur, until that reservoir of freezing cold deep ocean water is finally depleted.

"**Christmas Day in Hong Kong has seen no let-up in clashes between police and pro-democracy protesters.**
The police used tear gas and pepper spray as demonstrators gathered again in a number of shopping districts.
The latest protests began on Christmas Eve, with police battling activists who were throwing petrol bombs.
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said many residents and tourists had seen their Christmas celebrations ""ruined by a group of reckless and selfish rioters"".
""Such illegal acts have not only dampened the festive mood but also adversely affected local businesses,"" she said in a Facebook post on Wednesday.
The protests began in June, focusing on a bill that would have allowed the extradition of suspects to mainland China.
The bill was later withdrawn, but demonstrations have since evolved into a broader movement demanding investigations into police brutality and democratic reform.
The protests, which had been largely peaceful in recent weeks, have turned more confrontational over the festive season.
On Wednesday hundreds of activists marched through shopping centres shouting slogans such as ""Liberate Hong Kong! Revolution of our times!"" Police arrested several people after using pepper spray.
The clashes were on a lesser scale than Tuesday, when activists set up barricades and threw petrol bombs across the city, while police used pepper spray and batons.
Hong Kong was a British colony until 1997, after which it was returned to China under the ""one country, two systems"" arrangement.
Under the agreement, Hong Kong is expected to have a high degree of autonomy from mainland China, and residents enjoy more freedoms than those on the mainland."
"It may just be the worst-kept secret in Australian fashion. The country doesn’t process its own wool or cotton. Processing skills and infrastructure moved overseas in the 1990s, when tariff protections for textiles, clothing and footwear industries were significantly reduced, and China was able to undercut prices and offer more efficient ways to turn raw materials into marketable commodities. Three decades on, and despite producing 90% of the world’s fine apparel wool, all but a handful of Australia’s wool processing plants have closed. More than 80% of Australia’s wool clip is sent to China and more than 90% of Australia’s cotton is exported – with the majority processed in Asia. Opportunities for innovation in the local fibre industry have stagnated.  This should be surprising. The Woolmark symbol is a source of national pride, sought after in Parisian ateliers and the knitting mills of Reggio Emilia. Australia has a near monopoly on fine apparel wool, which should make it a lucrative crop, yet the capacity to capitalise on this is limited. The devastating bushfires of last summer were barely embers when coronavirus hit. In June, citing the pandemic’s impact on supply chains and concerns about Australian reliance on China, the National Farmers’ Federation called for the revival of food and fibre manufacturing, saying the return of value-adding processing would greatly benefit regional economies and protect Australian farmers. Victoria’s minister for agriculture, Jaclyn Symes, has also expressed an interest in local processing. The pandemic has increased demand for local manufacturing, a welcome change for sustainable fashion advocates. Local production is not inherently more sustainable, but local manufacturers have to comply with Australian environment and employment laws. Sceptics of local processing point to both as expensive obstacles that sent manufacturing offshore. But David Michell, the owner of one of the few remaining Australian wool factories, has told ABC’s Landline that technological advancements have made it cheaper to process wool locally than in China. As the price of processing locally has gone down, the value of doing so has risen. Fashion designers increasingly seek to tell provenance stories. Consumers want to know where the cotton in their T-shirt was farmed, and buyers are willing to pay premium prices for products like non-mulesed wool. As the Uighur forced labour scandal exposes companies including Nike, H&M and Uniqlo, industry leaders and consumers alike are taking a hard look at supply chain transparency. For Australian processing to be profitable, it will have to embrace automation and innovation in niche areas. It will also have to keep up with consumer demand for products manufactured with carbon footprint, human and animal rights in mind. The global fashion industry is responsible for between 5% and 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions. With resources running out and carbon emissions on the rise, the switch to best practice is inevitable, making it commercially shrewd for the Australian industry to act on strategic changes now. One of the most persuasive solutions proposed is the regenerative farming of natural fibres, including wool, cotton, linen and hemp. Regenerative farming is a broad term that includes a variety of agricultural practices focused on regenerating healthy landscape function, with the ultimate goal of sequestering carbon from the atmosphere and returning it to the soil. The NSW farmer and author Charles Massy tells me that regenerative agriculture “clearly has the best solutions to carbon drawdown” and scientists have flagged carbon drawdown as critical to meeting the emissions targets of the Paris agreement. Early adopters are already integrating regenerative farming into their supply chains. Yvon Chouinard describes it as “the number one thing humans can do to combat global warming”. His company, Patagonia, is working with farmers in India to convert to regeneration and has released a collection of regenerative cotton t-shirts. The luxury group Kering (whose brands include Gucci, Saint Laurent and Bottega Veneta) is working with the Savory Institute to increase the regenerative production of raw materials in its supply chain, and on a separate project in China to quantify carbon sequestration in cotton. This global trend presents an opportunity for the Australian fibre and textile industry to capitalise on the ingenuity and excellence that already exists on Australian farms. In June CSIRO scientists announced the development of genetically modified coloured cotton, a landmark breakthrough that will limit the environmental harm caused by the dyeing stage of cotton production. In NSW, a farmer and researcher, Dr Jim Watts, spearheaded breeding the smooth rolling skin merino, a sheep that doesn’t need to be mulesed. There is also a growing movement of Australian farmers employing holistic grazing of cattle and sheep to restore soil health. Given Australia’s vulnerability to a warming atmosphere, as evidenced by the record fires that ravaged bush and farmland this year, the incentives for investment in regenerative practices and local production are not just commercial. Australia’s farmers and rural communities deserve policy initiatives that would create new jobs, reward Australian innovation and take care of the land. As the world looks towards post-pandemic life and the Australian government assesses which industries to kick-start with investment, the return of onshore processing of wool and cotton should be considered. It might just mean the beginning of an exciting period of innovation in Australian fashion and textiles. Lucianne Tonti is a consultant for sustainable designers in Europe, the US and Australia"
"At 10am on 16 August, I drove east from Santa Cruz to Oakland to my mom’s nursing home, where I was being allowed in, in full PPE, to kiss her a last goodbye. As I curved north through San Jose, I could see a billowing steel-gray fire cloud among the hills to the east. Lightning flashed past Berkeley as I pulled into the parking lot. On the way home, I took the long route across the San Mateo Bridge, then over the top of the San Francisco Peninsula and south from Half Moon Bay. Halfway down the coast I saw a helicopter dropping bright red pillows of retardant on to a fire streaming its smoke in a flat horizontal panel out to the ocean. Ten minutes later I passed white smoke pouring down another canyon on my left. Before I pulled into my driveway at the edge of Santa Cruz, I could see a fourth, giant fire spewing far to the south beyond Salinas. By afternoon it was clear that the fires I’d seen were just a few of the hundreds sparked all over northern California by freak thunderstorms that weekend, in which 10,800 lightning strikes ignited 367 fires. Soon, hundreds of the small fires converged into bigger and bigger ones, so fast and so vast that Cal Fire didn’t even give names to the largest ones as it usually does, resorting to acronyms like the SCU Lightning Complex, the LNU Lightning Complex, and my own fire to the north and east of Santa Cruz, the CZU Lightning Complex.  Two of those fires are now the second- and third-largest in California history. By 28 August, the largest, the LNU fire north-east of the Bay Area, had burned 371,000 acres. Together, the fires have burned over a million acres. We’re in “unprecedented” mode, here, as climate change, Covid-19, and other factors converge to wreak vast destruction. By Monday the 17th we knew quite how serious the fires were. The first looming threat was to the 100,000-person city of Vacaville, between the Bay Area and Sacramento, where walls of flame moved in on tract houses in residential neighborhoods. The TV showed median barriers aflame at night alongside Interstate 80, eight lanes of cars sliding past them a foot or two away. I sat in the backyard in the middle of that day amid 10ft-high sunflowers bathed in eerie diffuse golden light, waiting for the phone call that my mother had died. Two hours later after the call arrived, the nursing home texted that 20 residents and staffers had just tested positive for Covid-19; four had been hospitalized. I began the process of contacting relatives, banks, and the lawyer, and of counting the 14 days until I could de-quarantine myself and come remotely near any of my loved ones – although never less than 6ft, and always outside, as for the last five months. By Tuesday it was clear that Santa Cruz and broad swaths of the greater San Francisco Bay Area were in big trouble, and the fires were spreading uncontrolled throughout the local mountains and up the coast. Ash floating down innocently, coating our cars. We began to obsessively watch Cal Fire’s press conferences on our computers three times a day, in our own local version of the New York governor Andrew Cuomo’s Covid briefings on C-Span. We even had our own new rock star, a handsome man named Michael with long black wavy hair and hip suits, a sign-language interpreter. Local evacuations began. They started high up in the mountains, in the towns of Boulder Creek and Bonny Doon, and the small coastal towns northward – Davenport, Pescadero, La Honda. Every day new towns were cleared out in succession down the San Lorenzo Valley, through close-knit communities of ageing hippies, working-class rural people, and Silicon Valley commuters. By 25 August, 78,000 people had been evacuated from Santa Cruz county alone. My best friends Gerri and Steve evacuated from Ben Lomond on Wednesday. Steve, a botanist, moved two carfuls of his 50-year-old succulent collection down to a friend’s house in Santa Cruz, and then, when the evacuation zone threatened southward, moved them farther around the Monterey Bay to a friend’s in Watsonville. He left behind the rest of his plants, unwatered in 90F heat, and he and Gerri took refuge in their daughter’s tiny apartment in Santa Cruz. Soon the evacuation line marched down all the way down to lap at the city limits, six blocks or so away from them. Would the fires drive all the way to the sea, destroying our entire city, like the Paradise fire two years ago? The next day I packed up my own things into piles by the front door, making agonizing, sudden choices about what to leave behind. Unlike residents of rural California, who live with evacuation threats every summer and fall, I’d never thought it through before. That night we all felt a body blow: the headquarters buildings at our beloved Big Basin Redwoods state park, the first state park in California, built by the civilian conservation corps in the 1930s, burned to the ground. I was conceived in that park; I’ve researched and written about its history. Suddenly it was just another disaster story in the New York Times. With their bark of asbestos, the 1,500-year-old trees will survive. But it was rough to see photos of lurid flames glowing within their trunks. During those first several days, Cal Fire never quite provided exact maps of the fire’s edges, as it has in past fires. Eventually the spokesperson admitted that they didn’t actually know where the fires began and ended. They were massively understaffed. “Typically, in an area of that size, would have probably 10-20 times the resources to put out that fire. We simply don’t have it,” admitted Mark Brunton, an operations chief for Cal Fire, referring to the fire in the Bonny Doon area, north of Santa Cruz. “In my 34 years of doing this, I’ve never been this early in the seasons with this many catastrophic fires.” Because of the Covid-19 risk, the firefighters have had to practice social distancing; they can’t just hop into trucks together or get close on the lines. In past years, a solid chunk of California firefighters have been prisoners working under widely denounced conditions. But 8,000 prisoners have been released because of Covid, sharply limiting that pool. Most powerfully, the sheer scale of fires has overwhelmed the system. In the face of such unprecedented demand, there weren’t enough helicopters or planes to survey the extent of the fires or drop fire retardants – and most days the smoke was so bad they couldn’t fly anyway. Daniel Swain, a climate researcher at UCLA, tweeted that on Friday: “This is probably the most widespread and violent summer thunderstorm event in memory for Bay Area & also one of the hottest nights of the year.” Brunton, the Cal Fire chief, described burning conditions that were “unprecedented and unseen by veteran firefighters”. This is what climate change looks like. By Saturday, the University of California, Santa Cruz, where I taught for 30 years, had been evacuated, and the line was eight blocks away from my house along the coast. The air quality became deeply threatening. I sealed up all the doors and windows with packing tape; used a chamber system of sealed rooms to exit or enter the house (and didn’t leave); and had to repress my panic at the new, higher level of isolation. We couldn’t even visit in backyards any more – if we were privileged to have one. I started tracking statistics and curves by the hour: the percentage of fire contained, the number of people evacuated, the air quality index (43, great, run outside!; 78, rut-roh; 189, nooo … !) The EPA said we should choose a “clean room” big enough for the whole family, keep it sealed off, and use a wet cloth to constantly wipe its surfaces clean. Now add Covid-19 to all that, and track the daily Covid numbers for Santa Cruz, still alarmingly high. Where do 74,000 northern California evacuees and their pets and livestock go, if everyone’s households are sealed off for virus protection? Which relatives or friends let whom in? Government refuges opened immediately in the high schools, the civic auditorium, and other venues; but, full of people inside in close quarters, shared bathrooms, they’re ripe for mass contagion. The mask advice is now reversed: cloth masks don’t work for smoke, you need an N-95 mask; and you’re wearing it to protect yourself, not others. On Sunday the National Weather Service announced a dangerous red flag warning for the next 48 hours, on high alert for high winds and new lightning that could spark new fires throughout the state, which would stretch the meagre resources still further. The Los Angeles Times reported that if the firefighters couldn’t hold the line at Boulder Creek, at the top of the San Lorenzo Valley, they would let the flames sweep down all the way through the towns below, to the bulldozed line at Santa Cruz. I’d just been reading Willa Cather’s 1918 novel My Ántonia, with its haunting story of Pavel and Peter, the Russians driving a sled in the cold moonlight who watched as a wolf pack picked off the dozen sleds behind them one by one, and finally threw the bride out of their own sled to lighten the load. Would Gerri and Steve’s house, two-thirds of the way up the valley, be tossed to the wolves? On Monday, the new storms didn’t materialize and the weather service lifted the Red Flag early. I wept for the first time. I am vastly privileged in facing this. As the air thickens and poisons, the region’s farmworkers are trying to survive an ever more deadly environment. Many of them are Mixtec indigenous people from Oaxaca, Mexico, who go to work every day without Covid protection, trying to keep from starving and hoping to send money to those without food at home. California farmworkers live in substandard housing with little ability to social distance at work or at home, and, like other Black and brown peoples of this country, they are dying in droves. Two maps of California now overlap: one from the EPA, with red zones showing the state’s worst air quality often accumulating in the Central Valley near Fresno, and a second one from the state’s health department showing rising Covid cases in the same zone. As I write, it is now day 13 into the fires and of my post-nursing-home personal Covid quarantine. The briefings tell us optimistically of 26% containment, of “repopulation” zones. They are alternately cheering and careful, as they warn of new dangers: burned bridges, falling trees, thick layers of organic matter called “duff” burning on the forest floor that moves in clandestine ways to undermine roads and cross under hard-fought fire lines. We aren’t venturing out far – the air quality is still too terrible much of the time, and the roads closed. I’m not exactly unpacking, just warily plucking daily shirts and socks out of the suitcase. We know that many of the historic ranch buildings on the north coast are gone, and their owners’ livelihoods. More than 700 houses have burned down. In response, beautiful networks of mutual aid are proliferating on social media to provide shelter, take in livestock, and drop off meals, in all the moving ways people take care of strangers in these situations. But it’s not enough. We need government, and government not in service to institutionalized racism and elite greed. How do we channel those mutual aid networks, and the vast need for a government that serves all the people, into a better future? My mom is gone, and so is life as we knew it once again. We awake to yet another new reality, another reconstruction of our daily lives. We begin, now, to imagine doing simple tasks – going to the post office, say – but then remember, wait, the world out there is still all changed; it’s still dangerous to come in and out its door as maskless strangers veer toward us. In answer to our pleas, the cavalry from Idaho, Canada, Australia did arrive. But soon they’ll move on, leaving us to make it through the worst of the fire season still ahead in September and October. We are waiting patiently for the rains to come in late October, far away. We are waiting for 3 November. We are waiting for the vaccine. We look to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the Green New Deal star in the sky. But visibility is often 25ft, so we hunker down and share our extra cellphone chargers, our N-95 masks with broken elastic, our detective novels, and our love, and open the doors of our hearts.

"If radical action to reduce emissions isn’t taken in the next decade or so, many of today’s schoolchildren could live in a world that’s 3℃ or 4℃ hotter by the time they enter their later years. Their working lives would be defined by routine weather extremes, widespread crop failures and catastrophic sea level rise. With such grim prospects, the natural question facing young people is how did we get here? School climate strikers and the student-led Teach the Future campaign have called for wholesale reform of the education system to help answer this, and prepare the younger generation for facing a future of intensifying climate and ecological crisis.  But the UK currently has no formal training or support for teachers to carry out “climate education”. There is so little space in the curriculum that some schools teach it in PSHE, along with sex education, or “British values”. Without clear guidance, schools might use materials designed to mislead students about the science.

 The situation is now so bad that simply telling the truth about the climate crisis in the classroom also raises serious questions about the effect on a child’s mental health. Parents could be forgiven for not wanting their children to hear it. But even a curriculum that offers a better grasp of the facts of climate change and opportunities to reconnect with the natural world might not be effective on its own. Climate action will require fundamental and rapid changes in all spheres of life. Children need to know why we are in this situation, and what must come next.  Teachers have a crucial role to play in this process. They will have to help young people critique and rethink the deeply ingrained assumptions, attitudes and expectations that run throughout history, and now endanger much of life on Earth.   The history curriculum in the UK doesn’t list climate change among its examples of “challenges for Britain, Europe and the wider world 1901 to the present day”. Human history isn’t considered to have significant environmental contexts or consequences, despite the fact that modern life is a product of the energy bonanza provided by fossil fuels. A major problem with public understanding of the current predicament is that most information and interpretation comes from the sciences. Scientists can explain what is happening and make projections for what might happen in the future. It isn’t part of their discipline to know why human societies have made the choices that have taken us to this point. Yet contemporary climate and environmental crises are the products of human activity. History is usually taught and imagined as a sequence of events through which human societies advanced from primitive technologies and patterns of social organisation to their current, highly complex and sophisticated state. These events are usually described as “developments”, or even as “progress”.

 When history is taught like this, students are left without any way of understanding why human societies and ecosystems are suddenly on the brink of collapse. There is no frame of reference for what, by any standards, is actually a vast, escalating failure of human choices.  Many large-scale human societies have failed to grasp the realities of life on a finite planet. Much of what these societies have done has been based on wilful blindness to the effects of exploitation. This fundamental ignorance has persisted and in some ways grown over the centuries, even as technology has advanced. A climate history curriculum should unpick concepts like “development”, and basic assumptions about what “progess” looks like. When the climate crisis is taught as a byproduct of the modern world, it hides the deep history of human activities and value systems that continue to shape the present day.  Over the centuries, powerful states tended to exhaust the resources of surrounding landscapes, producing sharp social hierarchies and celebrating the “victories” of male warrior elites. Written accounts of these battles and wars, and their politics, are the traditional core of historical study.  Students could instead think about how societies over the centuries have obtained, organised and used resources, and what the consequences have been for human inequality and the environment. They should learn about modern European empires through their vast capture of human and environmental resources by conquest and colonisation. They need to understand how this related to industrialisation, and how exploiting racialised slave labour, and increasingly, fossil fuels, generated the energy that fuelled modernisation and the affluent lifestyles of today.  Accompanying this should be a much clearer view of what was lost in these processes. European ideas about land management displaced localised and ecologically appropriate practices, with disastrous, ongoing consequences for indigenous populations and colonised ecosystems. The greatest biodiversity today is found in areas managed by indigenous peoples.

      Protecting indigenous cultures is crucial for saving the world’s biodiversity


 Students could learn from the ways of living, thinking, and gaining knowledge of different indigenous communities around the globe. Existing topics, such as the slave trade and the civil rights movement, would resonate differently to students who knew the continuing costs and consequences of empire. History teaching could also look at climate change in the past and investigate how societies weathered environmental stress. Modern science could be recast as a tool that helps societies mitigate problems like climate change, rather than an engine of progress. If today’s children are equipped with a deep and complex sense of how humans have inhabited environments, and the consequences for people and other species, they will understand the present situation far better, and make informed decisions about the future. They will be more resistant to arguments that prioritise economic growth over sustainability and social justice, and will have a clearer sense of how old power structures perpetuate modern problems. All of this is crucial to educating – and preparing – the climate strike generation. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter. Climate change is inevitable. Our response to it isn’t."
"Harold Hayes, the last surviving member of a band of airborne American medics and nurses who   in   Albania in 1943 and survived German attacks, blizzards and horrific privations on a   trek to their rescue on the Adriatic coast, died on Sunday in Medford, Ore. He was 94. His death, at a hospital, followed an operation to remove a blood clot from his leg, his daughter Margaret Bleakley said. The survival of the 30 noncombatants was a   secret of World War II: the story of 13 female nurses, 13 male medics and the   crew of a medical evacuation plane who were stranded behind enemy lines for nine weeks, hiding in villages and caves in wintry mountains, afflicted with lice and dysentery, often near starvation and hunted by German patrols. Their odyssey was classified during the war and for years afterward to protect partisan fighters, Allied agents and villagers who gave them food, shelter and guidance. Some were shot by the Germans for their acts of kindness, and after the war, as rumors became death sentences, those even suspected of helping the Americans were executed by Albania’s Communist dictator, Enver Hoxha, whose rule ended with his death in 1985. “For many years, I didn’t say anything about what happened in Albania,” Mr. Hayes said in a 2015 telephone interview with The New York Times from his   home in Medford. “After the war was over, Hoxha was ruthless. If he discovered the names of anyone who had helped us, he had them and their families executed. ” Mr. Hayes had no special role in the group’s survival, but by outliving all his wartime comrades, he became a last conduit for their story, which was related in a 1999 memoir by one of the nurses, and more recently in several books, notably “The Secret Rescue” (2013) by Cate Lineberry, whose account relied heavily on Mr. Hayes’s recollections. The perilous adventure began two months after Italy surrendered and Allied forces invaded Italy to begin pushing the Germans back across Europe. On Nov. 8, 1943, the nurses, medics and fliers of the Army Air Force’s 807th Medical Air Evacuation Transport Squadron took off from Catania, Sicily, bound for Bari, on Italy’s east coast, where hundreds of wounded troops awaited air evacuation. Their   cargo plane carried no weapons, but the pilot, First Lt. Charles Thrasher, 22, anticipated no fighting. With him were a   radio operator and crew chief. The nurses, all second lieutenants, were 22 to 32 years old. The medics, including Mr. Hayes, 21, from Indianola, Iowa, were all equivalent to staff sergeants and ranged in age from 21 to 36. An hour into the flight, the plane became lost in a huge storm over the Adriatic Sea. Its compass and communications failed. Blown 100 miles off course, it crossed the coast of Albania and was intercepted by German fighters and attacked by antiaircraft guns. It plunged to a belly landing in a marsh 25 miles inland. Willis Shumway, 23, the crew chief, was the only casualty, with a knee injury that left him unable to walk. The disoriented Americans had no idea where they were. Fearing a fuel explosion, they scrambled out of the plane and encountered their first bit of luck. Striding out of a woods was a band of   men with rifles and daggers. One spoke a little English. He was Hasan Gina, an   partisan leader. He told the Americans they were in Albania. Later, they would learn that they were 150 miles east of Bari, on the wrong side of the Adriatic, surrounded by German forces that had occupied Albania for months, and were caught in a civil war between rival partisan groups. The Americans knew almost nothing of Albania, a small, mostly Muslim country that had changed little in centuries. The mountainous terrain was dotted with impoverished villages. There were no railroads and few roads. Mules and horses were the main transportation. There was little running water or electricity. Winters were brutal, food was scarce, and blood feuds were common among the ferociously proud peoples. With only a general plan to reach the west coast and somehow cross the Adriatic to Italy, the Americans began walking in the wrong direction. Over the ensuing weeks, guided by the partisans, they trekked through mountains and valleys, sometimes cutting back or traveling in circles to avoid German patrols, living in the open or sheltering in villages and sharing cornbread with peasants. The Americans were soon listed as missing in action, and War Department telegrams, beginning “regret to inform you,” were sent to their families back home. The survivors, meantime, carried Sergeant Shumway on a stretcher made of seats from the plane they later found pack animals for him. After five days, they rested at a   town called Berat, where they were cheered, mistaken for the vanguard of an Allied invasion to liberate Albania. They also met other partisan leaders, and learned of a British agent who had recently parachuted into the country. Their respite lasted only a few days. Then, they awoke to gunfire and the explosion of artillery shells as German forces entered the town. In the ensuing confusion, German planes strafed a truck carrying some of the escaping Americans. Three nurses were separated from the main group and left behind in Berat they took refuge in a farmhouse, and remained in hiding in the area for four months. The main group of Americans climbed on foot to a mountain village and were caught in a crossfire between partisan groups. “It was the first time the Americans had heard of the rival group, and they were beginning to realize they were in as much danger from the country’s internal battle as they were from the Germans,” Ms. Lineberry wrote in “The Secret Rescue. ” They encountered other perils. “Some of the blankets offered to them to ward off the cold night air were infested with fleas and lice,” the author wrote. “Since they’d crashed, most of them had been unable to bathe, aside from splashing some water on their faces and arms from mountain streams or an occasional basin, and they were all filthy and now battling fleas, lice and the GIs,” Army slang for diarrhea. The Americans were often unable to find food. Facing starvation, they made tea by boiling straw and ate berries that worsened their diarrhea. Sharing with peasants was sometimes a culture shock. Mr. Hayes and another medic saw a sheep’s head roasted over coals, then split in half with an ax. “The Americans watched   as two women each took   of the head and ate everything, including the eyeballs,” Ms. Lineberry wrote. “Nothing was wasted. ” As autumn waned, blizzards enveloped the Americans. Their clothing was too thin. Their shoes were worn out. “Though all their feet soon felt like blocks of ice and their bodies shivered, they knew they had to keep going,” Ms. Lineberry wrote. “The snow was coming down so fast they could barely see the person in front of them, but they had to stay together to avoid losing one another in the blinding white storm. ” On Nov. 27, British intelligence in Albania learned from partisans that the American plane had crashed and that the nurses, medics and crew were alive, trying to reach the coast. Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Allied commander in Europe, and President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the families of the missing were told. In December, an American rescue plan was developed, led by an Army captain, Lloyd G. Smith, 24, who was assigned to the Office of Strategic Services, precursor of the Central Intelligence Agency. Under cover of darkness, he slipped onto the heavily guarded Albanian coast by boat and set up a base camp in a cave in the cliffs overlooking the Adriatic. Others joined him, and they moved inland to find the Americans. The British, meantime, organized a second rescue effort under Lt. Gavan Duffy, a secret agent who with a small team had reached Albania months earlier by parachute and on foot. Through partisan contacts, he found the Americans in eastern Albania and began leading them westward, intending to reach the coast. But halfway there, at Gjirokaster, German troops blocked the way, and the Americans were too sick and exhausted to go on. He radioed for an American air rescue. Two   cargo planes flew in with fighter escorts. But the Germans disrupted the landing, and Lieutenant Duffy called it off. The Americans, after the euphoria of nearly being rescued, were crushed. But they resumed their journey, and with American and British help reached the coast. On Jan. 9, after a   ordeal, 27 Americans  —   10 nurses and 17 medics and fliers  —   boarded a British launch and crossed to Italy. Three nurses remained behind in   Berat. Captain Lloyd Smith brought them to safety in March 1944. They rode pack mules most of the way to the coast and were met by a torpedo boat, which took them across the Adriatic. After the war, Mr. Hayes returned to civilian life, attended Iowa State College and became an aeronautical engineer for North American Aviation, designing military planes and conducting studies for the Air Force and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration until he retired in 1984. He married the former Betty Allen in 1944. She and their daughter survive him, as does another daughter, Victoria Sprott two brothers, Karl and James a sister, Virginia McCall two grandsons and a  . Harold Lyle Hayes was born in Pekin, Iowa, on April 11, 1922, to Ralph and Jenella Van Gorp Hayes. He graduated from high school in Indianola in 1940. After Japan attacked Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, he was drafted, volunteered as a medic and by 1943 was in Sicily, flying evacuation missions. “When he first returned to Allied lines, he had nightmares of being chased,” Ms. Lineberry wrote of Mr. Hayes. “Those faded with time, but as was true of many in the group, he rarely talked about his ordeal over the years. ”"

Susquehanna steam electric nuclear power station
Guest essay by Eric Worrall
Illinois nuclear plant operators have demanded more subsidies, to help keep unprofitable nuclear plants open, to prevent a surge of fossil fuel usage which they claim will occur if they are closed. If the British experience is any guide, this is just the beginning.
Nuclear Power Fights for a Spot in Illinois’ Clean Energy Future
State lawmakers are debating whether to keep ailing nuclear plants alive. The outcome will set a precedent for more states to come.
With hard times setting in for some nuclear power plants, Illinois state legislators are trying to decide whether they should put nuclear facilities on life support, or lay them to rest early.
A combination of market forces and policy choices has made the nuclear business tougher in recent years, and that’s the case at two facilities in Illinois operated by Exelon. The company is telling lawmakers that the money-losing reactors will have to be brought offline prematurely unless the state lends support. That would result in lost jobs and a big dip in the state’s capacity to produce electricity—one that could have dirty, carbon-burning power plants stepping up to close the gap. With jobs, tax dollars, and environmental quality at stake, it’s turned into a dramatic battle in the final days of the state’s legislative session.
Exelon is searching for a way to subsidize the struggling plants, arguing that the steady, zero-carbon energy source is a public good worthy of public support. One idea in particular is dividing environmental groups: Should nuclear plants, by virtue of being carbon-free, be grouped in with solar, wind, and other renewable energy sources in state initiatives to clean up the grid? It’s a dilemma that could soon spill over into other states as the business and policy landscapes change around clean energy.

In Britain, heavy handed government intervention destroyed a once healthy energy market. The British market is now a patronage driven disaster, where everyone demands special treatment.
In the words of Amber Rudd, the British Government Energy Secretary;
The second phase of modern energy policy began when Tony Blair signed the Renewable Energy Target in 2007.
[Political content redacted]
What has this left us with?
We now have an electricity system where no form of power generation, not even gas-fired power stations, can be built without government intervention.
And a legacy of ageing, often unreliable plant.
Perversely, even with the huge growth in renewables, our dependence on coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel, hasn’t been reduced.
Indeed a higher proportion of our electricity came from coal in 2014 than in 1999.
Read more: https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/amber-rudds-speech-on-a-new-direction-for-uk-energy-policy
The problem is, renewables need huge government subsidies to attract investment. But subsidising renewables, and giving them priority access to the grid, makes other forms of energy uneconomical – if you have to keep cycling your gas, coal or nuclear plant up and down, depending on whether the wind is blowing, it is impossible to make a profit.
Renewables are too unreliable to replace other sources of energy. Politicians quickly learn that they cannot allow now unprofitable fossil fuel and nuclear power companies to fail.
Guess what happens next? As soon as energy companies catch on that the politicians have taken over, that it is no longer the job of energy companies to keep the grid stable, everyone gets into the government handout game, even coal plant operators. They all demand and receive their own slice of the subsidy cake.
British politicians thought they were in charge of energy policy. Instead they have been captured by energy companies, who have learned through experience that politicians have far more to lose when the electricity grid fails than they do.
If politicians don’t act fast, to restore sanity to US energy markets, the same thing will happen to America.

For years David Bellamy was one of the best known faces on TV.
A respected botanist and the author of 35 books, he had presented around 400 programmes over the years and was appreciated by audiences for his boundless enthusiasm.
Yet for more than 10 years he has been out of the limelight, shunned by bosses at the BBC where he made his name, as well as fellow scientists and environmentalists.
His crime? Bellamy says he doesn’t believe in man-made global warming.
The article continues here.

"JERUSALEM  —   In a pointed act of defiance against international pressure, Israel on Tuesday approved a huge new wave of settlement construction in the occupied West Bank. The announcement made clear that just a few days into the Trump presidency, the Israeli government feels emboldened to shake off the constraints imposed by the Obama administration and more willing to disregard international condemnation. Leaders from 70 countries met in Paris more than a week ago and issued a warning that the   peace solution was imperiled by Israel’s expanding of settlements in   territory in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, as well as violence against Israelis. But even though Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has endorsed the principle of    states, in the past few days Israel’s campaign of settlement building has only accelerated. The first step came on Sunday, when the Jerusalem City Council approved 566 new housing units in East Jerusalem that had been delayed over President Barack Obama’s objections. Then on Tuesday, the Israeli government announced that 2, 500 new housing units would be built in the West Bank. Officials said most would be built in “settlement blocs,” referring to areas of the West Bank that Israel has long intended to keep under any future agreement with the Palestinians, possibly in return for land swaps along the boundary that separated Israel from the West Bank before the 1967 war. But in years of failed negotiations, the Israelis and Palestinians have never agreed on the size or location of such blocs. The Israeli Ministry of Defense said 900 of the newly announced homes were being planned for Ariel, an urban settlement of about 20, 000 residents that Israel considers a “bloc,” but is strategically  —   and problematically  —   located in the heart of the West Bank. It also said it would bring to the cabinet a plan to build a large industrial zone to create work for Palestinians in the southern West Bank. “We are going back to normal life in Judea and Samaria,” Avigdor Lieberman, Israel’s   defense minister, said in a statement announcing the new settlement building, referring to the West Bank by its biblical names. Asked about the Israeli move, the White House spokesman, Sean Spicer, said that Mr. Trump was still getting his team together and that there would be discussions with Mr. Netanyahu. “Israel continues to be a huge ally of the United States,” Mr. Spicer said. “He wants to grow closer with Israel to make sure that it gets the full respect that it deserves in the Middle East, and that’s what he’s going to do. Palestinian officials immediately denounced the new plans. “Once again, the Israeli government has proved that it is more committed to land theft and colonialism than to the   solution and the requirements for peace and stability,” Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organization’s executive committee, said in a statement. “It is evident that Israel is exploiting the inauguration of the new American administration to escalate its violations and the prevention of any existence of a Palestinian state,” she added, calling on the United States and other international players to take concrete measures against Israeli settlement activities. Israel’s campaign of settlement construction has brought widespread criticism. A month ago, the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution condemning Israel’s settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem as having no legal validity and constituting a “flagrant violation under international law” after the Obama administration decided not to veto the measure. Days later, the departing secretary of state, John Kerry, rebuked Israel’s settlement activities in an impassioned speech, saying, “The status quo is leading toward one state and perpetual occupation. ” But with Israel’s occupation of the West Bank in its 50th year, the Israeli government, dominated by   and religious parties, is clearly expecting a friendlier approach from the White House after years of tension with the Obama administration. David M. Friedman, the bankruptcy lawyer President Trump has nominated as his ambassador to Israel, has led a   arm of the settlement movement and has dismissed the idea of a Palestinian state alongside Israel. He has declared that he intends to work in Jerusalem, not Tel Aviv, where the American Embassy has been for decades, under the State Department’s insistence that the holy city’s status be determined as part of a broader deal between Israel and the Palestinians. It was not immediately clear whether the Israeli announcement had been coordinated in advance with Mr. Trump’s team. But beyond Mr. Netanyahu’s apparent attempt to chart a new course with Mr. Trump, he is also under intense pressure from the right flank of his governing coalition to demonstrate where his domestic loyalties lie. Naftali Bennett, the education minister and leader of the staunchly   Jewish Home party, has been goading the prime minister to seize the moment and take the extreme step of beginning a process of annexing the West Bank settlements to Israel. “Netanyahu is facing a historic decision: sovereignty or Palestine,” Mr. Bennett said on Monday. “We urge Netanyahu, don’t miss an opportunity that comes along once every 50 years. ” Mr. Netanyahu appeared to postpone any discussion of annexation: “This is no time for    decisions or political dictations, and this is no time for surprises. ” This, he added, “is the time for considered, responsible diplomacy among friends. ” The prime minister’s office said that in a phone conversation with Mr. Trump on Sunday, Mr. Netanyahu discussed the peace process and hoped to forge a “common vision” with Mr. Trump “to advance peace and security in the region, with no daylight between the United States and Israel. ” No more details were given. The peace process has been at an impasse since the last round of   talks collapsed in the spring of 2014. During the nine months of talks, Mr. Netanyahu attempted to appease Israel’s right wing by advancing plans for about 13, 000 new housing units in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, infuriating the Palestinian side. The weakened Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, who appeared reluctant to take risks of his own, never responded to the ideas that Mr. Kerry’s team had formulated for a framework to guide further negotiations. Now, with the change of American administrations, some Israeli analysts have recommended that Mr. Netanyahu take the opportunity to try to reinstate understandings that Israel had with President George W. Bush, who wrote in a 2004 letter that “already existing major Israeli population centers” should be taken into consideration in redrawing the borders between Israel and the West Bank  —   a reference to settlement blocs. But that came in the context of Israel’s plans to unilaterally withdraw from Gaza and from a section of the northern West Bank. And the case of Ariel serves to illustrate the contentiousness of unilaterally defining the blocs. Israelis have long labeled Ariel part of their national “consensus,” meaning that it would be included in Israel’s borders under any peace deal, and it often appears as one of the regular dots on Israeli weather maps. But Palestinian negotiators have always rejected that idea, arguing that Israeli control over Ariel would preclude the territorial contiguity of a Palestinian state. They also note that Ariel sits on a major aquifer. According to Tuesday’s announcement, 20 of the new units are to be built in Beit El, a settlement deep in the West Bank that has particularly benefited from Mr. Friedman’s   activities. The government promised in 2012 to build 300 units in Beit El, a settlement of about 7, 000 residents, to compensate for the   evacuation of part of a neighborhood there that was illegally built on private Palestinian land. So far, the promise has remained unfulfilled. According to Israel’s Ministry of Defense, bids will now be solicited for the construction of about 900 of the 2, 500 new units around the West Bank. But the rest, including most of those planned for Ariel, still have to go through additional planning phases, a bureaucratic process that can take months, if not years, and requires additional government approval at each stage. Oded Revivi, the chief foreign envoy of the Yesha Council, an umbrella organization representing the more than 400, 000 settlers in the West Bank, said in a statement, “We hope that this is just the beginning of a wave of new building across our ancestral homeland after eight very difficult years. ” But some in the settler camp played down the construction plans and expressed suspicions about Mr. Netanyahu’s intentions. “We are not stupid,” Bezalel Smotrich, a legislator from the Jewish Home party, wrote in a post on his Facebook page. Objecting to the government announcement mostly describing the advancement of existing plans in settlement blocs, Mr. Smotrich accused Mr. Netanyahu of “throwing a candy” to the settlers and playing “public relations tricks. ”"

Port Talbot, By Grubb at English Wikipedia (Transferred from en.wikipedia to Commons.) [Public domain], via Wikimedia CommonsGuest essay by Eric Worrall
Tata Steel has announced an immediate withdrawal from Britain, threatening 4000 steel working jobs, and 40,000 jobs in dependent industries. The main reason given for abandoning Britain, is the high price Tata is forced to pay for energy, thanks to Britain’s green energy policies.
Tata’s decision is nevertheless a body blow to steel in the UK, with wide industrial and political implications. The threat to 4,000 jobs at the UK’s largest steelworks at Port Talbot, a community which is synonymous with the steel industry today in the way Jarrow was with the shipyards a century ago, is existential. But the closure of Tata’s plants, if it goes ahead, could threaten at least 40,000 jobs nationwide and help to make a mockery of the “active and sustained industrial strategy” which George Osborne advocated as recently as last November.
It would be foolish to pretend that there would be no problem facing steelmaking in Britain that determined state intervention could not solve. Global market power in steel production has shifted decisively to China, while decades of underinvestment and a long-term decline in UK steel’s international competitiveness cannot simply be dismissed as unimportant, least of all at a time when public money remains tight. Tata, after all, is a company with a record of trying to take the long view. It invested in a new blast furnace at Port Talbot. But steel’s cost base, especially the prices it had to pay for energy, left it vulnerable to the glut that has followed the slowdown of the Chinese economy. China’s readiness to unload steel on global markets at marginal cost knocked the floor out of the industry elsewhere, including in the UK.

The Tata decision is the latest stage of an ongoing crisis in the British steel industry.
Leading left wing British opposition politician Jeremy Corbyn, a strong advocate of renewables, has demanded that parliament be recalled, to consider state subsidies and other emergency measures to prevent job losses in the steel industry. Sadly the list of measures Corbyn wants considered, does not appear to include tackling the root cause of the job losses – Britain’s insane green energy prices.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s elite establishment is having a very difficult time coming to terms with the outcome of USA’s democratic process. The country’s ZDF national public television recently and energetically fanned the flames of Trump-hatred, going so far as to compare the U.S. President to Adolf Hitler.
Madonna has company – in Germany.

Smiling ZDF German moderator Ilka Brecht proudly introduces the Trump-Hitler comparison under the guise of a parody. All images cropped from ZDF Frontal 21.
The spread of hatred and the defamation of Trump in Germany has been going on for some months now, but has reached new shrill levels. Last September German SPD (Socialists) Martin Schulz told Spiegel magazine last September: “Trump is a danger to the entire world,” comparing the then US candidate’s rhetoric to that of pre-World War II Nazi Germany:
Behind it there is sometimes even a blood and earth rhetoric that strongly reminds me of the time between the two world wars of last century and whose demons we all indeed still know.”
And since Trump’s “surprise” election success and his inauguration, the rhetoric and raw emotion have boiled to a head among Germany’s state-supported flagship media and top political leaders. Yes — the top political leaders — and not solely among some regular citizens venting in beer-halls. Without any surprise, the anger and hate are now rapidly spreading and radicalizing increasingly the population.
Assassination as solution to Trump presidency
Last Sunday in a televised discussion round German national weekly Die Zeit publisher Josef Joffe sparked outrage by telling viewers “an assassination” would be a solution to the “Trump catastrophe”.

Josef Joffe of German weekly Die Zeit said that “assassination” could be one way to remove Trump from office. Image cropped from Phoenix.
German media/top pols portraying US president as mad and evil
Last Tuesday the hate-filled rhetoric from the ruling elitist classes intensified several notches more: On ZDF national television political show Frontal 21, President Trump was directly compared to Adolf Hitler in a clip disguised as a parody, which was far more offensive than it was funny.

 “They both have funny hairdos.”
The Frontal 21 “parody” also said that both Hitler and Trump promised to build new roads and infrastructure, and boasted about drawing “huge crowds”, The ZDF used the following image:

ZDF then portrayed the US President as a maniac…

“rather vague”, “clueless”, “from the grace of God”
What is disturbing is that this “parody” is not something produced by some fringe site, but by federal government supported German ZDF national television, and thus cannot be dismissed. It is “public television” and so all citizens are forced to pay mandatory annual fees. Non-payment involves severe penalties. Yes, as a resident in Germany, I also have to watch my money get used to pay for this hate-garbage aimed at my President.
Leading politicians involved in public broadcasting
Not only the German top media are defaming the US president, but ao are the country’s top political leaders. Thomas Oppermann of the SPD party announced: “Donald Trump is not playing with a full deck.” Soon to-be-President Frank Walter Steinmeier called Trump a “hate-preacher“.
Also the Chairman of the ZDF administrative council is Kurt Beck (SPD) and it includes Bernd Neumann (CDU). Germany’s powerful public television and radio media network is increasingly a communication arm of the the German government. Other ZDF higher ups include politicians Matthias Platzeck (SPD) Horst Seehofer (CSU), Stanislaw Tillich (CDU) and Olaf Scholz (SPD).
Designed to unleash an assassin?
What could be behind the spreading of so much Trump-hatred and the harboring of assassination thoughts? It would not be overreach to suspect that the German government is fantasizing about triggering its own twisted new version of Stauffenberg, as Joffe openly expressed. What’s the point of the Hitler-comparison? It’s supposed to be funny?
How all this is supposed to serve to strengthen transatlantic relations with Europe is puzzling. On the economics side Germany itself enjoys a hefty trade surplus with USA, it’s 3rd largest trading partner, and so risks inflicting more economic harm to itself than to Trump. Already some in Germany are proposing closer ties to China as an alternative.
Moreover, the dirty attacks by the country’s leaders/media will hardly help lead to a solution concerning the VW fuel emissions scandal, and those of the other German manufacturers. In fact the potential $18 billion in fines from VW would be more than enough to pay for the border wall to Mexico.

"**Exchange students currently studying in Hong Kong have been called back to the UK by their university over fears for their safety.**
Students from the University of Warwick have been ""strongly urged"" to return as ""it is no longer appropriate"" for them to remain, its student newspaper said.
The cost of flights will be reimbursed, it said.
It follows an escalation in tensions between protesters and police, with a number of clashes around universities.
Student newspaper The Boar, which first broke the news, said an email sent to students stated the university had been ""closely monitoring the developing situation in Hong Kong"" and it had ""reached the decision... that is is no longer appropriate for our students to remain"".
""Warwick is now strongly urging you to curtail your period of study or work placement abroad and to return to the UK, or wherever you are usually resident, as soon as possible,"" the email continued.
In a statement, the university said: ""Like several other UK universities we are contacting Warwick students and staff in Hong Kong and offering them the opportunity to return to the UK and are advising them to do so.""
The University of Nottingham said it had also offered flights home to any students concerned about their safety.
On Wednesday, the Chinese University of Hong Kong said it would cancel classes for the rest of term after a violent stand-off between police and protesters.
In a statement published the same day, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said there had been ""clashes around a number of universities, with a particular focus at the Chinese University of Hong Kong in Sha Tin"" adding that students ""should avoid areas where protesters are gathered"" and ""take extra care when moving around the campus"".

"Every time there is a flood, drought or cyclone, some politician or lobbyist immediately cites
it as evidence of “Climate Change” and uses the occasion to promote the Emissions Trading
religion.
People need to get a sense of history and a sense of perspective. There is nothing new
about climate change. Climate change and “extreme” weather are permanent features of life
on earth. Temperature, humidity and carbon dioxide content of the air, as well as winds and
cloudiness, are all liable to rise or fall from hour to hour, day to day, season to season and
from one climate era to the next.
Global climate is not a still life, it is a moving picture. Weather and climate (average weather
over 30 years) are always changing, but mankind has little to do with it and can do nothing to
change it. Life has always been threatened by natural disasters such as cyclones, droughts,
floods, blizzards, hail storms, earthquakes, volcanoes and tsunamis. Sensible people accept
that and try to be prepared for what seems most likely to occur. Right now, global cooling
seems more likely to occur than global warming, but we should be prepared for either.

"The climate breakdown continues. Over the past year, The Conversation has covered fires in the Amazon, melting glaciers in the Andes and Greenland, record CO₂ emissions, and temperatures so hot they’re pushing the human body to its thermal limits. Even the big UN climate talks were largely disappointing. But climate researchers have not given up hope. We asked a few Conversation authors to highlight some more positive stories from 2019. Heather Alberro, associate lecturer in political ecology, Nottingham Trent University After decades of climate talks, including the recent COP25 in Madrid, emissions have only continued to rise. Indeed, a recent UN report noted that a fivefold increase in current national climate change mitigation efforts would be needed to meet the 1.5℃ limit on warming by 2030. With the radical transformations needed in our global transport, housing, agricultural and energy systems in order to help mitigate looming climate and ecological breakdown, it can be easy to lose hope.  However, countries like Costa Rica offer us promising examples of the “possible”. The Central American nation has implemented a refreshingly ambitious plan to completely decarbonise its economy by 2050. In the lead-up to this, last year with its economy still growing at 3%, Costa Rica was able to derive 98% of its electricity from renewable sources. Such an example demonstrates that with sufficient political will, it is possible to meet the daunting challenges ahead. Richard Hodgkins, senior lecturer in physical geography, Loughborough University Movements such as 350.org have long argued for fossil fuel divestment, but they have recently been joined by institutional investors such as Climate Action 100+, which is using the influence of its US$35 trillion of managed funds, arguing that minimising climate breakdown risks and maximising renewables’ growth opportunities are a fiduciary duty.  Moody’s credit-rating agency recently flagged ExxonMobil for falling revenues despite rising expenditure, noting: “The negative outlook also reflects the emerging threat to oil and gas companies’ profitability […] from growing efforts by many nations to mitigate the impacts of climate change through tax and regulatory policies.”  A more adverse financial environment for fossil fuel companies reduces the likelihood of new development in business frontier regions such as the Arctic, and indeed, major investment bank Goldman Sachs has declared that it “will decline any financing transaction that directly supports new upstream Arctic oil exploration or development”. Hannah Cloke, professor of hydrology, University of Reading In March and April 2019, two enormous tropical cyclones hit the south-east coast of Africa, killing more than 600 people and leaving nearly 2 million people in desperate need of emergency aid. There isn’t much that is positive about that, and there’s nothing new about cyclones. But this time scientists were able to provide the first early warning of the impending flood disaster by linking together accurate medium-range forecasts of the cyclone with the best ever simulations of flood risk. This meant that the UK government, for example, set about working with aid agencies in the region to start delivering emergency supplies to the area that would flood, all before Cyclone Kenneth had even gathered pace in the Indian Ocean. We know that the risk of dangerous floods is increasing as the climate continues to change. Even with ambitious action to reduce greenhouse gases, we must deal with the impact of a warmer more chaotic world. We will have to continue using the best available science to prepare ourselves for whatever is likely to come over the horizon.  Marc Hudson, researcher in sustainable consumption, University of Manchester More than 1,200 local authorities around the world declared a “climate emergency” in 2019. I think there are two obvious dangers: first, it invites authoritarian responses (stop breeding! Stop criticising our plans for geoengineering!). And second, an “emergency” declaration may simply be a greenwash followed by business-as-usual.  In Manchester, where I live and research, the City Council is greenwashing. A nice declaration in July was followed by more flights for staff (to places just a few hours away by train), and further car parks and roads. The deadline for a “bring zero-carbon date forward?” report has been ignored.  But these civic declarations have also kicked off a wave of civic activism, as campaigners have found city councils easier to hold to account than national governments. I’m part of an activist group called “Climate Emergency Manchester” – we inform citizens and lobby councillors. We’ve assessed progress so far, based on Freedom of Information Act requests, and produced a “what could be done?” report. As the council falls further behind on its promises, we will be stepping up our activity, trying to pressure it to do the right thing. Dénes Csala, lecturer in energy system dynamics, Lancaster University Before the 2019 UK general election, I compared the Conservative and Labour election manifestos, from a climate and energy perspective. Although the party with the clearly weaker plan won eventually, I am still stubborn enough to be hopeful with regard to the future of political action on climate change.  For the first time, in a major economy, a leading party’s manifesto had at its core climate action, transport electrification and full energy system decarbonisation, all on a timescale compatible with IPCC directives to avoid catastrophic climate change. This means the discussion that has been cooking at the highest levels since the 2015 Paris Agreement has started to boil down into tangible policies.  Mark Maslin, professor of earth system science, UCL In 2019, public awareness of climate change rose sharply, driven by the schools strikes, Extinction Rebellion, high impact IPCC reports, improved media coverage, a BBC One climate change documentary and the UK and other governments declaring a climate emergency. Two recent polls suggest that over 75% of Americans accept humans have caused climate change. Empowerment of the first truly globalised generation has catalysed this new urgency. Young people can access knowledge at the click of a button. They know climate change science is real and see through the deniers’ lies because this generation does not access traditional media – in fact, they bypass it. The awareness and concern regarding climate change will continue to grow. Next year will be an even bigger year as the UK will chair the UN climate change negotiations in Glasgow – and expectation are running high. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter.

"In the early hours of Monday January 20 2020, something unusual was happening in the atmosphere above the southern British Isles. Just after midnight, air pressure records for London were broken at Heathrow airport, where the barometer reached 1,049.6 millibars. That’s the highest level since records began in 1692. It broke the previous record for London of 1,049.1 millibars, which was recorded at Kew Observatory at 11am on January 18 1882. If you have a household barometer, you might have seen its needle settle well beyond “Very Dry”. But despite this being an exceptionally rare weather event, it’s very unlikely that anyone else would have noticed anything unusual, because the human body is not very sensitive to atmospheric pressure. People are much more sensitive to the colour of the sky though, and anyone out for a Sunday afternoon walk in southern England cannot have failed to notice breathtakingly blue skies. That’s because high pressure systems bring clear skies and dry conditions. We’re lucky to know air pressure readings from London all the way back to 1692, because of amateur meteorologists like John Locke, the philosopher. He lived in London during the 17th century and kept a daily record of the height of his barometer between 1692 and 1696. But we have readings for somewhere in London for almost every day since then, often through individual diary entries. In the middle of the 19th century, the observatories at Kew and Greenwich started keeping daily records. Since 1949, a 24-hour record has been kept at Heathrow.  Between 9pm on Sunday January 19 and 3am on Monday 20, a centre of high pressure lay over south Wales, Somerset and Devon. A Met Office barometer in Dunkeswell, Devon at 2am recorded 1,050.4 millibars – the first time in almost 90 years that 1,050 millibars has been observed anywhere in England or Wales, and the first time for over 60 years that this level has been reached anywhere in the British Isles. Since 1800, 1,050 millibars has been reached somewhere in the British Isles on only nine occasions, and for short periods. While air pressure set a record high for south-east and central southern England on January 20 2020, the existing national record of 1,053.6 millibars, logged in Aberdeen on 31 January 1902, remains intact.

 Although it may sound counter-intuitive, Britain’s recent atmosphere of high pressure (meteorologically speaking) may have been caused by very low pressure on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean. A deep centre of low pressure developed rapidly off the east coast of the US a few days prior which resulted in a severe snowstorm in eastern Canada. The blizzard dumped around 75 cm of snow on Newfoundland, but it may also have helped break high pressure records in Britain. That’s because the air drawn out from the low pressure system off the US east coast by a strong jet stream had to be redistributed elsewhere. Normally this would happen over a much larger area of the North Atlantic, leading to the rapid development of a fairly intense anticyclone, which is not uncommon. On this occasion, though, the outflow of air from the intense storm could only be redistributed at high levels in the atmosphere over a relatively small part of the North Atlantic, because of several other atmospheric depressions. This resulted in an intense anticyclone (an area of high pressure) forming and then developing rapidly close to the British Isles. High pressure areas are large regions of gently sinking air. The descending air warms as it sinks, evaporating clouds, and that’s why anticyclones tend to produce dry, settled weather. In winter, you can expect clear skies with frost and fog. Computerised forecast models run by the Met Office and the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) predicted the high pressure area with near pinpoint precision. Its eventual position and record intensity was accurately forecast several days in advance, before it had even begun to form. The combination of clear polar air with very dry air throughout the lower atmosphere – caused by the sinking air in the high pressure area – made for one of those rare, sparkling winter days that are more typical of expensive high-altitude Alpine resorts. Enjoy it while it lasts."
"Thousands of Extinction Rebellion protesters have descended on Parliament Square in London leading to at least 90 arrests, as the group kicked off 10 days of civil disobedience to demand government action on the climate crisis. Four XR groups blocked roads as they marched across central London waving brightly coloured flags and banners demanding MPs back what they have described as the “climate and ecological emergency bill”. A number of protesters sat in the middle of an intersection next to Parliament Square blocking traffic, as dozens of police officers swooped in to carry them away to vans parked nearby. The Metropolitan police issued restrictions under section 14 of the Public Order Act to limit the protest to the off-road area of Parliament Square gardens. The restrictions also stipulated that no boats, vehicles, trailers or other structures were allowed at the procession at any point on its route on Tuesday, and said the protest must finish by 7pm. Commander Jane Connors of the Met said: “The reason we have implemented these conditions is that we know these protests may result in serious disruption to local businesses, commuters and our communities and residents, which I will not tolerate.” Similar protests took place in Cardiff, where protesters hung a large banner from the office of the secretary of state of Wales, and in Manchester, where demonstrators blocked roads as they congregated in St Peter’s Square with giant puppets. In contrast to the group’s rebellion in October 2019, when some members caused controversy by targeting a rush hour DLR service, organisers said the focus this time is intended to be institutions of power, with disruption aimed at the heart of Westminster and timed to start on the day MPs returned to parliament from summer recess. The Green MP Caroline Lucas addressed the crowd in Parliament Square to announce that she would table the climate and ecological emergency bill: “Thank you for showing more political leadership than that place over there,” she said, gesturing to the House of Commons. The protest is the first mass gathering of XR protesters since a rebellion planned for earlier this year was cancelled because of the pandemic, and the group has been warned it could face a £10,000 fine for organising a gathering of more than 30 people under coronavirus legislation. Many protesters said the pandemic had made them more determined to protest. “By living the way we live, we are making ourselves more vulnerable to these pandemics and that’s why [the climate crisis] should never have been off the agenda, it should be part and parcel of the Covid debate,” said 50-year-old Ava, from Lewes in East Sussex. Along with a specific focus on the proposed bill and calls for a national citizens’ assembly to tackle the crisis, some protesters took specific aim at the HS2 high-speed rail project. A makeshift “Boris the Bank Engine” featuring cardboard carriages labelled “Lies” and “Communities Devastated” chugged from Buckingham Palace towards parliament, while protesters chanted “Stop HS2” and people dressed as ticket inspectors handed out flyers “We just hope to extend the message to people who are not aware of HS2 because it’s taking place largely outside of London so many people don’t feel the loss because they can’t see it,” said Simon Morgan, an activist. The vast majority of those taking part were wearing masks, and XR said a digital rebellion was taking place online for those unable to attend the demonstrations in person. “If it’s OK to get in a metal tin and fly up in the sky breathing in other people’s recycled air for four hours, then it seems ridiculous to me that you would persecute people who are trying to save the long-term health of the planet,” said Kerry Evans, 45, who had travelled from Winchester for the protest. “To me, it’s madness not to be here. It’s madness not to be trying to force our government into action. I couldn’t not be part of this and look my children in the eye when I kiss them goodnight.”"

From the NASA Goddard Facebook page, 4/29/16:

Academy Award winning actor and environmental activist Leonardo DiCaprio visited Goddard Saturday to talk about NASA Earth science with former astronaut Piers Sellers, the current deputy director of Goddard’s Sciences and Exploration Directorate.
They discussed NASA missions studying changes in the Earth’s atmosphere, water and land masses for a climate change documentary DiCaprio has in production.
Using Goddard’s Hyperwall high-definition display system, they viewed presentations based on actual science data captured by NASA’s fleet of satellites orbiting Earth, as well as climate and ocean-current modeling done by the NASA Center for Climate Simulation at Goddard. The background visual shows the biosphere with data from a NASA satellite instrument called the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS).
http://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/details.cgi?aid=10704
Mr. DiCaprio also viewed the clean room where the next-generation James Webb Space Telescope is being developed.
I have to wonder, did Piers Sellers tell DiCaprio what he was actually looking at? That image from SEAWIFS shows the greening of the planet thanks to increased CO2, as documented on WUWT back in 2008, and corroborated by a recent press release from NASA Goddard: NASA: Carbon dioxide fertilization greening Earth, study finds
My bet is both were oblivious to what was behind them on the big screen. If they weren’t, I doubt they considered it important information.

From People Magazine:
DiCaprio, 41, has been working on a climate change documentary, having traveled to Baffin Island in the Arctic last summer. In 2007, he created, produced, co-written and narrated The 11th Hour, a documentary that gave viewers a look at the state of the global environment including visionary and practical solutions for restoring the planet’s ecosystems.
DiCaprio’s last climate film, The 11th Hour, was a total bomb, earning just $985,207, and in limited theater release with just 111 theaters. In the USA, it earned only $707,343 and was ranked 259th for the year out of all films.

With a poster like this, it isn’t hard to see why people didn’t react well to it. After all, who wants to see a film that makes the audience look like jack booted Gaia thugs?

Meanwhile the movie Climate Hustle is gaining steam. Go see it Monday night.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSeasonal forecasts are iffy. Right now, however, there are strengthening indicators showing winter brutality in the pipeline for Europe rushing at us like an express train.
Don’t let the current relatively benign autumn conditions fool you. I’ve been following all of this over the past couple of weeks, and as a result decided last Friday to get the winter tires installed! The trend has crystalized and solidified.
It doesn’t look good if you’re hoping for a mild euro winter start – like the one we really had last year.
German weather and climate site wobleibtdieglobaleerwaermung here provides some background on what is in store in the latest analysis titled:
Winter is coming early to Europe – polar vortex splits!”
Right off the bat the site provides the latest ECMWF analysis of the geopotential 150 hPa (approx. 14 km altitude, lower stratosphere) from 28 October 2016, writing:
The polar vortex for this time of the year is unusually powerful and has expanded far to the south. It has two partial vortices over Siberia and Northern Canada (polar vortex split), whereby the polar vortex over Siberia is stronger. A powerful cold trough of the partial vortex over Siberia (Rossby waves) is positioned over North and Eastern Europe and feeds cold polar air downward. Source: www.geo.fu-berlin.de/met/winterdiagnostics.html.”

The German site also points to the QBO, quasi-biennal ossillation in September 2016 has flipped in favor of powerful easterly winds:
In the easterly wind phase (negative QBO) the Arctic polar vortex can collapse (negative AO), and then with high probability lead to a cold winter.”
Bastardi: “vicious” conditions for mid November
Meanwhile 40-year veteran meteorologist Joe Bastardi further solidifies the early winter European trend with his addictive weekly Saturday Summary at WeatherBELL Analytics site here:

At the 12:45 mark Joe presents a chart of the forecast model 11-16 days out for the northern hemisphere (above), calling the Russian-European situation “vicious”, exclaiming that he is “in awe of that”. Note the vast swath of cold extending all across Siberia, Russia, China, India, Europe and beyond.
Keep in the back of your minds, however, that the atmosphere is chaotic, and thus surprises are always in store. There’s no 100% certainty in these forecasts. Still, the probabilities for colder than normal conditions over the weeks ahead are strong – likely much stronger now than Clinton winning the presidency.

"The UK’s new Agriculture Bill has been called “one of the most significant pieces of legislation for farmers in England for over 70 years”. It could directly affect the livelihoods of 460,000 people and determine the future of the 70% of UK land area (17.4 million hectares) currently under agricultural management. The bill sets out the UK’s approach to farming as it prepares to leave the European Union, replacing the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) that the UK has been part of since 1973. At the bill’s core is a shift away from direct payments to farmers based upon the amount of agricultural land they manage. This was a feature of the CAP that was heavily criticised as it pushed up land prices, creating an entry barrier for younger farmers, and benefited large landowners disproportionately. It also meant the farming of unproductive land that otherwise might have been turned into wildlife habitat.

      Explainer: what is the EU Common Agricultural Policy?


 Instead, landowners will in future be paid to produce “public goods”. These are things that can benefit everyone but bring no financial reward to those who produce them, like clean air and water. Over the next seven years, farmers will move from the CAP regulations to a new system of environmental land management contracts. These will detail the terms and conditions under which farmers and land managers will receive funding. Subsidies are expected to be paid out from taxpayer funds at the same rate as the EU – about £3 billion a year – to enable landowners to deliver the public goods set out in the UK government’s 25 Year Environment Plan and the Clean Growth Strategy.  Achieving these goals will seem rather daunting though. They include clean air and plentiful, clean water, but also thriving wildlife, reduced risk from environmental hazards such as flooding and drought, raising animal welfare standards and enhanced beauty, heritage and opportunities to engage with the natural environment. One of the big priorities of the bill is soil. Erosion rates from ploughed fields are between ten and 100 times greater than rates of soil formation. As a result, the UK faces a crisis of food security within our lifetimes. The government will reward farmers who protect and improve soil quality with measures like crop rotation, and give ministers new powers to regulate fertiliser use and organic farming.

      Soil is our best ally in the fight against climate change – but we're fast running out of it


 Alongside the Agriculture Bill is the new Environment Bill, which will enshrine environmental principles in UK law after Brexit. The UK will lose access to EU bodies that monitor and enforce  environmental laws, so the new Environment Bill is essential for maintaining standards. With the EU watchdog gone, setting up a new independent Office for Environmental Protection has been proposed, but it’s unclear how effective it will be in imposing the heavy fines necessary to enforce standards. Farmers often feel isolated from the powers of government and daunted by the task of delivering both agricultural productivity and environmental enhancements. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has at least committed to designing the new contracts in close collaboration with farmers and land managers. Finding ways to engage those who will be most affected by the changes will be important for ensuring the policy works on the ground. Landscape-scale solutions to decarbonising agriculture and averting the climate crisis will require huge changes. They won’t be possible without popular support.

      Climate crisis: the countryside could be our greatest ally – if we can reform farming


 But the bill still lacks crucial detail. There are no firm commitments to protect British farmers from cheap, low-standard foreign imports, which is particularly important as the government seeks to negotiate trade deals with countries whose standards are lower than Britain’s. Building a post-Brexit food and farming system that protects the environment won’t be easy. There are exciting opportunities embedded in this bill. But restoring land to health and guaranteeing food supplies will need proper engagement with those who will be affected and a solid scientific bedrock on which to build the government’s ambitious – but underdeveloped – plans."

The year had barely begun when stories started to emerge of a worrying number of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, caused by a mysterious new “coronavirus”. The Conversation published its first story on the outbreak [on January 13](https://theconversation.com/mystery-china-pneumonia-outbreak-likely-caused-by-new-human-coronavirus-129729). At that point, it was spreading in China, with a few people testing positive in Thailand, South Korea and Japan.



Less than two months later, the virus (officially named [SARS-CoV-2](https://theconversation.com/todays-disease-names-are-less-catchy-but-also-less-likely-to-cause-stigma-131465)) has hit more than 100 countries, claiming more than [3,800 lives](https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-outbreak-a-new-mapping-tool-that-lets-you-scroll-through-timeline-131422) and infecting over 111,000 people. [Regions](https://theconversation.com/italys-darkest-hour-how-coronavirus-became-a-very-political-problem-133178) on opposite sides of the globe are in lockdown. The international economy is in turmoil. Flights are grounded, with at least one [airline](https://theconversation.com/flybe-could-it-be-time-for-a-government-backed-regional-airline-133191) already having gone out of business. Fear has lead to [xenophobia](https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-the-latest-disease-to-fuel-mistrust-fear-and-racism-130853) and shops are selling out of essentials – including [toilet paper](https://theconversation.com/why-are-people-stockpiling-toilet-paper-we-asked-four-experts-132975).



The Conversation’s unique global network of academics, producing rapid, trustworthy journalism, has played a crucial role in separating fact from fiction at this time of international uncertainty. Operating in four languages ([English](https://theconversation.com/us/topics/covid-19-82431), [French](https://theconversation.com/fr/topics/covid-19-82467), [Bahasa Indonesia](https://theconversation.com/id/topics/covid-19-82797) and [Spanish](https://theconversation.com/es/topics/covid-19-83090)), our editors have provided co-ordinated and pointed coverage that has reached millions of readers. Now, with the world still seemingly much nearer the beginning than the end of this crisis, we launch this weekly column spotlighting coronavirus coverage from all eight editions of the network. There is [already so much being read and republished](https://theconversation.com/uk/topics/covid-19-82431) (for free, we have no paywall, as we exist to disseminate information and democratise knowledge for the public at large). This new weekly update will see different Conversation editors around the world focus on key themes related to the virus, highlighting some of the best of network’s content.



Initially, the World Health Organization (WHO) decided that the outbreak wasn’t a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). We had an expert on hand to [explain why](https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-outbreak-whos-decision-to-not-declare-a-global-public-health-emergency-explained-130441). But the situation changed rapidly, and on January 30 the disease was declared a global health emergency. Aubree Gordon, a professor of public health at the University of Michigan, gave a [clear account](https://theconversation.com/who-declares-global-health-emergency-over-coronavirus-4-questions-answered-130940) of exactly what that means.



By then, people were hungry for knowledge about the new threat. With access to thousands of experts via our global network, The Conversation has been able to provide evidence-based advice on everything from how to [wash](https://theconversation.com/yes-washing-our-hands-really-can-help-curb-the-spread-of-coronavirus-132915) and (importantly) [dry your hands](https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-and-handwashing-research-shows-proper-hand-drying-is-also-vital-132905), to how to [protect your children](https://theconversation.com/worried-about-your-child-getting-coronavirus-heres-what-you-need-to-know-131909), to whether [facemasks](https://theconversation.com/what-really-works-to-keep-coronavirus-away-4-questions-answered-by-a-public-health-professional-132959) provide any protection.



We have also had authoritative coverage on the growing [impact on the world economy](https://theconversation.com/le-coronavirus-pese-de-plus-en-plus-sur-leconomie-mondiale-132805) of COVID-19 (the official name for the disease), how it is making science [more open](https://theconversation.com/the-hunt-for-a-coronavirus-cure-is-showing-how-science-can-change-for-the-better-132130) (and the concomitant risks it entails), and how [vaccine development](https://theconversation.com/heres-why-the-who-says-a-coronavirus-vaccine-is-18-months-away-131213) is progressing.



Our coverage has included a look at the steps [Nigeria](https://theconversation.com/steps-nigeria-is-taking-to-prepare-for-cases-of-coronavirus-130704) is taking to prepare for an outbreak, how governments in South-East Asia are [tackling](https://theconversation.com/combating-medical-misinformation-and-disinformation-amid-coronavirus-outbreak-in-southeast-asia-131046) medical misinformation, and what the coronavirus [emergency declaration](https://theconversation.com/what-the-coronavirus-emergency-declaration-means-for-canada-130950) means for Canada.



Authors have also sought to put the outbreak in context of other pandemics. A researcher at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine [launched an interactive map](https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-outbreak-a-new-mapping-tool-that-lets-you-scroll-through-timeline-131422) on The Conversation that lets readers scroll through time to see how the disease has spread. It also compares the COVID-19 outbreak with other infectious disease outbreaks, such as Sars, swine flu and Ebola. Other authors went further back in time and compared the current outbreak with the Black Death, both in terms of the [economic impact](https://theconversation.com/what-can-the-black-death-tell-us-about-the-global-economic-consequences-of-a-pandemic-132793) and the spread of [misinformation](https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-and-the-black-death-spread-of-misinformation-and-xenophobia-shows-we-havent-learned-from-our-past-132802).



Indeed, misinformation and [conspiracy theories](https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-is-a-breeding-ground-for-conspiracy-theories-heres-why-thats-a-serious-problem-132489) have been rife since the start of the outbreak. Paranoia even gripped beer drinkers, as [sales of Corona beer](https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-mais-pourquoi-les-consommateurs-ont-ils-pris-peur-de-la-biere-corona-132783) suddenly slumped.



The antidote to this nonsense is sober and reliable information, clearly written and easy to understand, so it is able to reassure rather than alarm. The Conversation’s global network of academic authors works with professional journalists to provide you with informed and up-to-date information.



As the pandemic runs its course, we will continue to bring you journalism from experts, writing within their areas of deep knowledge.

Guest essay by Leo Smith
Introduction
I decided to pen this, not because I am a ‘philosopher of climate change’ like the esteemed Rupert Read, whose self styled ‘philosophy of climate change’ is really a thinly disguised justification for Green politics, but because it appears to me that very very few people in the climate change business, actually understand why they need to understand a little philosophy to enable them to judge the climate change phenomenon – the social phenomenon that is – in a suitable context.
I am not a trained philosopher. I am an engineer, by training, but that was just a job. I have always retained a curiosity about other things, and part of that curiosity led me to try and understand the issues of philosophy as a part of something else I was engaged in, which has no bearing here.
I was moved to write this, because a short post as an obituary to one of the greatest philosophers of science ever – Hilary Putnam – received essentially no comment at all. I realised that not only did no one actually know who he was, but no one even recognised the importance of what he did.
What the philosophy of science does, and its part of what I want to introduce today, is to define what science is, and particularly what it is not, and to clearly delineate its limits. Since Climate Change is variously described here in disparaging terms as ‘Climate Sceance’, and ‘Scientastic methodology’ , It’s clear that many people have a gut feeling that Climate science is not ‘proper’ science. Also, a few years ago I was also involved in some online arguments with Creationists who declared that Creationism and Intelligent Design was equally valid a science as say Physics.
Finally, this gem caught my eye from Judith Curry’s site:
“In our post-modern world, climate science is not powerful because it is true: it is true because it is powerful.”
Lucas Bergkamp
All these examples show us that there is a problem: We feel that Science is being usurped by imposters, who are almost perpetrating a modern form of black magic with its tenets, and yet we can’t actually say why they are wrong…without which we can’t refute their arguments…and this is made worse by the conclusions of modern philosophers that actually, we don’t know and can’t know what is really real, because what we deal with is ‘Reality as a Social Construct’. This is taught to every good PPE. And a brief diversion into metaphysics is necessary at this point – a horribly crude one, but the attempt must be made – to outline what this actually means, and why it’s sort of true, but not the whole truth…
Reality as a Social Construct
I am going to assume everyone has seen the film The Matrix, about which I will say nothing beyond noting that it highlights a very real problem that has been at the basis of Metaphysical ponderings for millennia. Namely, how can we be sure that our perception and experience of the world, shows us what it really is, rather than some abstract model of it?
Or in fact, to go even further in the direction of what is called in Philosophy, Idealism. Throughout its history, Philosophy has veered from one extreme to the other, at times claiming that the material world, was merely a manifestation of Spirit, or Mind (Idealism), and at other times, claiming the exact opposite , that spirit and mind were merely what you get with physical beings as a property of what they are (Realism, especially Material Realism). If you like, Idealism said ‘what you see is what you (or God) create as a sort of illusion’ and the Realists said ‘what you see is what is really there, no need for all this god/spirit/consciousness rubbish. THAT is all an illusion…’. And no one could in fact decide which was which until the rise of Newtonian physics rather made it look like the Realists were onto something, and that by careful analysis of the material world, as it appeared to be, we could predict the future, in small but important ways.
And then Kant first, and then Schopenhauer put the spanner in the works by pointing out that the world, as it appeared to be, had to be at least partially a human construction. Now, two things are worth pointing out about that last sentence, and the first is that Kant and Schopenhauer and indeed their intellectual descendants were safely ignored by science, for the next 150 years or so, but their descendants were not ignored by more ‘social’ scientists. And the second is that all important qualifier – at least partially. Both Kant and Schopenhauer introduced the concept of (in Kant’s case) ‘Things in themselves’ – that is, what was ‘actually there’ beyond our mere perception of it, whilst Schopenhauer corrected that to ‘thing in itself’ claiming correctly that number and quantity were in fact part of the human construction, so we couldn’t say whether Reality consisted of one or many things!
Which is why today you will find social scientists glibly talking about reality as a social construct as if that were all it were, and scientists talking about reality being very nearly exactly what it seems to be, as if quantum physics had never been invented.
I personally grappled with these issues and came to a certain conclusion, and so I think did Hilary Putnam, before I even knew he existed, because neither model worked very well to describe the way science worked, especially quantum physics. And our resolution of the problem, expressed in as simple terms as it is possible to do, is basically this:
“We cannot know (lacking a Red Pill) whether we are in a Matrix, or not, and whether that Matrix is our own construction, someone else’s, or an aspect of what the world really is. So we cannot assume that our experience is ‘what is really there’ but on the other hand, to say that ‘all that is really there, is our own construction‘, implies that magic (control of Reality by Mind) ought to work, and it doesn’t. Therefore a model which says that there is something unknown and perhaps unknowable there, all right, but which we can only experience via self-constructed perceptions of it, seems to be the most efficient. And this is precisely what Kant and Schopenhauer said, and what quantum physics is revealing, and What Hilary Putnam said, and what I feel is worth trying to understand – namely that the world is in fact utterly weird and different from our experience of it, but all we have to work on is our mentally ‘socially constructed’ models of it. That is, we know our experience is limited, and less than the whole, and filtered by our own cultural prejudices, but that is all we have to go on”.
Of course the above, itself, is in fact just another model! And so is not ‘true’. But this brings me to one of the most fundamental issues that the philosophy of science has emphasised, are we actually looking for Truth, at all, when we Do Science?
Truth, Science and Occam’s Razor
People talk glibly about ‘scientific truth’. But, is there such a thing? Most philosophers would say no, there isn’t. And the way science is done, shows us why. Science begins in a view of the world – a model if you like – that starts with some ad hoc assumptions (the Kantian a-prioris) that we cannot know to be true. Namely that the world of our experience as a collection of ‘things’ in a space time universe where ‘stuff happens ‘ to change the experience of it over a a period of time, cannot in any way be shown to be correct. Nor indeed a further assumption, that in fact these changes are brought about by timeless Eternal Rules, what we would call the laws of Nature, or Physics, operating mathematically and exactly to turn the present into the future, via Causality.
But in order to ‘do science’ we have to assume that they are true. Which is why they are referred to as ‘metaphysics’ and ‘a priori‘ because they are ‘beyond physics’ and ‘before the fact’ of science.
Science made a huge impact on the philosophy of its day, because in spite of these objections to it, which were quite well understood by the theologians and philosophers of the day, it worked, and worked spectacularly well. And is is that success that led its protagonists, from Galileo to Dawkins, to claim that must mean it was True. And to this day the ‘social sciences’ are trying to emulate its successes and claim some truth content thereby, by calling themselves sciences, a condition known as ‘physics envy’.
And from there, it was but a short step from observing that one didn’t need to ‘believe on God’ to ‘do science’ which worked, to thereby claim that therefore God did not exist. But that’s a whole new can of worms.
Let me state the position that I believe Philosophy of Science to be in. The fact that Science works, when operating on the ‘rational materialist’ model that it has to assume is the case, neither ‘proves’ that the inductive hypotheses that it posits are ‘true’ or that indeed the whole rational materialist edifice upon which it all rests, is in fact valid metaphysics at all!
And this is where the pseudo-scientists and religious fundamentalists step in to say ‘well it’s all just another belief system, innit?’, and claim that it’s therefore no better than ‘climate science’ or ‘creationism’. Or ‘my little Jihad’..
And in a limited sense they are right! But there is one thing that separates proper science from the rest, and that is that it works! Yes, behind all the formulae and the mumbo jumbo that it seems to be, if you take the rational materialist’s world view, and operate upon it scientifically, you get to predict the future, more or less. The ‘planets’ will be where you thought they would, experiment will more or less produce the predicted results, and science based technology will mostly just ‘work’ as evinced by the fact that I can type this, and you can read it.
And that in the end is the only defence Science has to offer. Not that it’s true, or has any ‘truth content’ at all – although some still claim that the fact that it works is ‘strong evidence’ that its ‘true’ more or less – but that it works. And when it stops working, that’s a sign that it’s no longer science, or is refuted science. A proposition that didn’t produce predictions that matched reality…
The acknowledgement of this utter inability to provide any sort of proof of being true, is what the widely quoted and usually totally misunderstood ‘Occam’s Razor’ is all about. What the monk William of Ockham actually said was roughly “apart from God and the Holy Scriptures, and things that are self-evidently True, we should not construct elaborate fancies to explain things when simple ones are just as good”. This is widely misunderstood to mean that the simple explanations are the true ones. That was never Occam’s point. His point was all about utility – not truth content.
And that really sums up the second part of this diversion into philosophy: Science isn’t true, it’s what works to predict the future, and if it fails to work, it’s not Science any more. Creationism, Intelligent Design, and My Little Jihad, don’t predict the future. In fact they don’t actually even set out to predict the future. They are therefore Not Science. And not on a par with science. Insofar as Climate Science does set out to predict the future, its failed, or refuted science, because it’s failed to predict it accurately or usefully, and, insofar as it never was really intended to predict the future, it’s just another metaphysical position entirely on a par with Creationism, Intelligent Design, and My Little Jihad.
And that brings me to the final point I want to try and make, as to how philosophy, and in particular the a priori model of the sort of metaphysics that I, and I believe Hilary Putnam, espoused, can make sense of the socio-political narratives of climate change alarmism. And indeed very much of the politics of what is generally termed the Left, which is inextricably linked to it, as well as the Religious Right.
Morality as a Social Construct – the Emotional Narrative.
When I described the function and purpose of what I consider to be Science, what is perhaps startling is that in the end, the only value judgement I applied, or indeed feel I can apply, to it, is that it just works.
And this brings me to a peculiar moral position. Morality, more than physical reality, is a social construct. Moreover its not based on anything beyond humanity. Does the Universe care if we live, love, die, or were never born?
Only if you believe in an Anthropic God.
Otherwise it is simply not possible to distinguish right from wrong, good from evil, in any absolute sense. And yet our media is awash with narratives – emotional narratives – exhorting us to ‘Do the Right Thing’. But what actually is The Right Thing? Where can we find some objective yardstick for moral behaviour? Scriptures? The Democrat Party or the UK Labour Party? The Koran?
What light does the metaphysical model outlined earlier shed on the issues of right and wrong, good and bad?
Almost, but not completely, none. It has no concept of a morality in the traditional sense, it, like science, is totally amoral. But just as we arrive at a justification for Science in terms of its utility, we arrive at something like a moral position in terms of utility, too…
…It is conventional wisdom that Darwin’s theory of evolution leads to a sort of law called ‘survival of the fittest’ . However on closer inspection, that sort of Nietzschian perspective is shown to be false as well. What is actually the deductible corollary of the Theory of Evolution, is that it only leads to eradication of that which is so counter-survival, that the young of the species do not live long enough to reproduce themselves. 
And that is why we still have appendices. They haven’t killed us. Yet. Mostly.
This basic principle, that ‘That which persists, is that which is not sufficiently dysfunctional to create its own downfall‘ is a very important point to note, because it explains in a way why this is the worst of all possible worlds. It simply only needs to be that good, to keep ticking over.
If we apply it to humans and their socially accepted ideas, not just about the nature of physical reality, but the nature of the sort of moral and social reality which is the sandpit of the Intellectual Left, and of course those involved in proselytising Religions, like Radical Islam (My Little Jihad) and Creationism, we can see that any sort of elaborate nonsense, provided it doesn’t lead to complete mass suicide, is as good as any other, especially in a socialist post-modern industrialist society with welfare, where frankly all you need to do to survive is work out how to game the system for the welfare, and walk to McDonalds. What you happen to believe – whether you are in fact God’s chosen ones, or the dregs of society – is a free choice at the functional level. As long as it doesn’t make you sufficiently depressed to kill yourself before Having Sex, and Making Babies, it’s cool!
And if you have a Vote, or a pocketful of Someone Else’s Money, given to you by a Compassionate Caring State (allegedly), why then, if someone wants that money or that vote, and are not particular about how they get it, they will tell you anything you want to hear, and basically what that means is they will tailor an emotional narrative to exactly make you feel as good about yourself as possible, and sell it to you. Or one to make you feel as bad about yourself as possible, and sell you the antidote!
Whatever.
c.f. Marxism as the classic example. You the mass of voters are miserable, because they, the few people who have a bit of cash, are oppressing you, and so by revolting against them, you will all be as rich as they were before you took all their money. Or the State did, on your behalf.
The problem with selling you a reality that makes you feel good about yourself – ‘God loves you: Chill!’ is that you can’t actually really sell a product based on that. All the best marketing comes from identifying, or if not creating basic needs that the product will satisfy. Over and over.
Until Colgate, no one brushed their teeth twice a day, let alone after every meal, and if they did, they used salt. The Genius of Colgate, ‘For people who can’t brush their teeth after every meal’ was the subtle implication of guilt if you didn’t do that (and who did?) and the instant catapulting of Colgate Toothpaste into the top brand arena…
Prior to the invention of Radio, then TV, of course there wasn’t much opportunity for all this. OK we had religion, and could sell ‘indulgences’ to free people from sin, and pieces of the One True Cross. And saint’s bones and the like, all of which were profitable, but there are only so many bits of The One True Cross that you can sell.
But with the invention of the Printing Press, the Radio, and the State Broadcast, all this stuff – previously the province of either priests chanting in the Churches, or hedge witches muttering curses under their breath, in the pagan arena, this became a billion dollar business, and the primary means by which nation states that didn’t want to actually start a real war, fought each other. As an offshoot of the Great Game, propaganda and marketing became the primary weapon of war of all power blocs, and parties with aspirations. Less a Game of Thrones and more a Game of Lies.
And the reason is simple. Morality and emotion are in the end human constructs, and so are all the beliefs about rights and wrongs, good and bad, and so on, and have absolutely no objective Truth at all. When I talked about Idealism and Realism, it was with respect to the science of the material world, which I posited did at least represent something external, beyond human construction.
Where morality is concerned, however, there is nothing. Not if we are considering it as rational beings. We need to posit an external physical world in some sense, to make sense of everything, but there is no need whatsoever to posit an external moral standard. And that is the frightening and appalling truth that people find very hard to stomach, and why they find it easier to behave as if there were such a standard, and what we can say is that societies that have such cultural patterns, that behave as if there were some moral standard, are less dysfunctional than those that do not. If this is sounding a bit Nietzschian, and God forbid, Third Reich-ish, you are right. Societies bound by common beliefs that are strong, and beliefs not so fallacious as to ensure their destruction, are likely to trample all over societies that really can’t say any more what is right or wrong. My Little Jihad trumps Western Liberalism, Western Liberalism trumps careful scientific scepticism, because at a given level, they are simple clear and cohesive messages.
Not because they are true, or even morally right, but because they have a momentum and a quality that makes them successful. 
And this is, I would aver, precisely where we are with Climate Change, the socio-political phenomenon. Most people do not know the truth of whether it’s science or not, or whether it is true or not, even if it is science. And, most tellingly, most people do not care. Because in the field of human behaviour, voting and spending power is deployed not according to what is true, but according to what people (want to) believe to be true, or can be manipulated to believe to be true, and those can be poles apart. And Climate Alarmists are simply acceding to this position, They either don’t know that they are lying, or they actually don’t care if they are lying, because lying actually gets them, personally, a better life, than the truth! 
It’s only when we have to deal with the physical reality of the world, that the truth has any point to it.
False beliefs spin no turbines, but they can spin the economies and politics and religions of this world indefinitely. So long as they are not so dysfunctional as to result in “no sex and no propagation”.
And the wonderful post Christian compassionate Welfare States that we have built, with the best of intentions, have resulted in a population who can believe in almost anything, from Aromatherapy to Zoroastrianism, without it actually being a huge problem for their survival.
Until the wind drops, the turbines stop and Physical Reality kicks them in the pants.
Then the law of eradication of that which is counter-survival will happen, and billions will die.
Up till now, the questions have been:
Do you want to be:
(a) On the winning side?
(b) Morally right ?
and
(c) Scientifically correct?
(d) Alive?
And by choosing climate alarmism most people felt they made (a) and (b) and hoped that if (c) were true, (d) would result.
But a careful recourse to sceptical philosophy, shows that (c) is almost certainly wrong, and because it’s wrong, (d) becomes a real issue, and because (d) is a real issue, it’s not so clear that (a) accrues either. And who cares about being morally right, if you’re scientifically wrong, on the losing side, and dead?
The very great danger that we face, is that political propaganda, hearts and minds, and all that, has gone too far. Much too far. It’s one thing to sell toothpaste to guilty teeth-brushers, but to sell wind turbines and Carbon Credits to guilty Ecos, is pushing it. And if the total inanity and confusion with which the Left have flooded Western Society for the last two generations has resulted in a society that no longer knows what it believes in, or why, and where anything it feels is probably wrong in someone’s moral handbook, and is too polite and nice to say ‘so what?’, proves to have basically resulted in no ability to cohesively resist forces which will destroy it, well, so, it will be destroyed. There comes a point at which dysfunctionality will destroy a society that is full of crazy ideas and has no idea how to keep itself alive.
A simple message went out: “Climate change threatens our very existence, because it is true”.
We need to reverse that with a simple statement: “Climate change threatens our very existence, because it isn’t true”.
And if you want voting guidance, remember that all you are voting for is always going to be a pack of lies, no matter who is telling it. Just vote for the most amusing liars, and the ones that look too incompetent to wreck everything, and hope that someone somewhere has the intelligence to realise that it is in the end it is not in anyone’s best interest to destroy the world in pursuit of power and profit, no matter how much they tell you that that is in fact exactly what they are trying to prevent.
In conclusion
It has been interesting trying to compress a lifetime’s personal journey, into just a few pages, and focus the impact down to a very selective target audience. What I really hope to have done, is to show why and in what way some of the more interesting aspects of metaphysics are really important in terms of real-life/here-now issues.
Metaphysics is, in itself, the study of the assumptions we have to make in order to be able to think and talk about the world at all, the concepts and ideas and prejudices that underpin our idea of ‘what the world consists of’. It has gone out of fashion because after millennia of argument, the modern philosophers decided that it wasn’t possible to decide what the One True Picture really was, and that argument was therefore pointless. If I read him aright, that’s probably where Wittgenstein left the matter. However as an engineer, I am not interested in the One True Picture, just a useful picture (or indeed pictures) that work, to solve the problems I encounter. And that is where I find value in metaphysics, in the construction of pragmatic metaphysical systems, that actually solve problems. These metaphysical systems are of course just models, and therefore can never be proven to be true, all one can hope for is that the insights they provide and the pictures they produce help to solve immediate problems.
Hilary Putnam was the philosopher who most seemed to be taking a similar approach. Unsurprisingly since he was working with physicists at the edge of quantum theory to try and make sense of the ‘facts’ of quantum physics and reconcile them with the ‘facts’ of ordinary common sense, a similar conflict led me to similar territory. Namely the hypothesis that the world we experience as individuals and indeed cultures, is a model, that is limited in scope, thoroughly and inevitably steeped in prejudice, and is an unknown and unknowable distance from ‘the Truth’. It is that dreaded Social Construct . And conflicts arise because we deny this. Once we acknowledge the terrifying truth that everybody lives in their own world, and that stuff which they will swear is Real and the Truth, is to other people, simply perplexing rubbish, because they are employing a different metaphysical set of assumptions about it, most of the conflicts disappear.
It is the humility needed to accept that science is not truth, on the one hand, but neither is the moral high ground of the ‘Liberal Arts’ crowd either. There is an apocryphal joke that sums it up:
“When I want to get somewhere, the last form of transport I would choose is a Harley Davidson”
“But when I am awn ma Hog, I am already exactly where I wanna be!”.
And there, in a nutshell we have it. In the absence of an external point of moral reference, we need the emotional narratives to somehow inform us at a personal level of where we want to be. But in terms of getting there, we have to throw out the left brain, and invoke the right brain, to arrive. The mistake of the adherents of the Left, is that they fail to do this. The mistake of the adherents of the Right, is that they don’t actually know where they want to go.
Perhaps Western technology came so fast that we were spoiled for choice as to where we should go, and that explains the rise and rise of the ’emotional’ side of ourselves, as we desperately looked for reasons why we should or shouldn’t deploy the technology in terms of creating a ‘better future’ without really knowing what that meant, until it arrived. And found that perhaps after all it wasn’t better. Just bigger. A telling point is, that as compared with say a generation ago, the biggest killer of young males is no longer road accidents, but suicide.
We have lost the emotional certainties of a cohesive religious culture, and thrown open the door to any and every kind of nonsense, all competing for space in our brains, and most of which is marketed to strip the individual of his vote or his cash, or both.
I have no solution, other than to reiterate what I answered in reply to “You claim to be an Atheist, or at least an Agnostic, yet seem to behave as a better Christian than most churchgoers. How come?”
“Because I think it’s a better way to live, to behave as if there were a God, as if there were some judgement over one’s life, and not only does it make me personally feel better, it creates a cohesive humble and co-operative and strong society. Why can’t we accept paying lip-service to a religion we don’t believe in, on the grounds that its simply a good thing for us, and society to do, for our own survival?”
Where metaphysics is concerned, we are compelled to behave as if the a priori assumptions we make about the world are in fact ‘true’.
In the end, my point is that we can’t prove that they are, and they may not be, so we should not prosecute our deductions from those assumptions with the zeal of certainty. But neither should we give up. They may not be the Truth, but they are, used correctly, nearer true than anything else we have to hand. And what is manifestly and demonstrably false is when we hypothesise a structure that claims to explain and predict some aspect of the metaphysical position we have already taken, when in fact it does nothing of the sort. AGW fails to actually pass the tests of a scientific theory.
There is no moral compass. But there is a pragmatic one. It is the one that gets us where we want to go, and its name is Science and Reason. It can’t help with deciding where we want to go, but it can once we have decided that, tell us how to get there efficiently. If applied correctly.
There is no way we can know absolute truth, but, inside of a set of metaphysical assumptions, we can tell if some hypotheses are less true than others, because they don’t actually work.
It’s a pretty lousy set of criteria on which to base the survival of a whole species, but friends, in the end, that is all we have got. Put your trust in what works. Not because [it is] true, but because [it] is not demonstrably false. Yet.
And hope that you have not simply found a temporarily advantageous metaphysics.
The one and only cautionary picture belongs here.

The University of Aberdeen is also recalling 10 of its students in Hong Kong as a result of the disruption.
The University of St Andrews said it was in regular contact with its students there.
The move to recall students follows escalating anti-government protests in recent days including violent clashes at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK).
All schools and kindergartens were closed by the education bureau on Wednesday.
On Thursday a notice was posted on the University of Hong Kong website which effectively closed the campus down. It said it would only maintain ""essential and emergency"" services on campus.
The Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) does not advise against travel to Hong Kong but warns of the potential for ""clashes between police and protesters involving significant violence.""
BBC Scotland has found that:
Meanwhile the University of St Andrews would not confirm the exact number of its students and staff in Hong Kong but said it was in contact with them and will ""continue to monitor the situation.""
Hong Kong has been racked by five months of anti-government protests.
The campaign started in opposition to a now-withdrawn plan to allow extradition to mainland China, but it has since morphed into wider demonstrations backing democracy and opposing the actions of the police.

This post presents model-data comparisons of ocean heat content.  It is a correction and update (with 2015 values) of the modeled and observed trends in ocean heat accumulation that were presented in Chapter 1.24 – A Rough Calculation of the Amount of Missing Heat…A Critical Issue of my free ebook On Global Warming and the Illusion of Control – Part 1 (25MB). In that chapter of the book, many of the model trends listed on the graphs were in error, with the trend values too low, bringing them closer to the observations.  In other words, my errors favored the models. My apologies for the mistakes. Those errors have been corrected in this post and will be corrected in the ebook in its final release later this year.

Chapter 1.24 – A Rough Calculation of the Amount of Missing Heat…A Critical Issue
If you’re new to the topic of global warming, you may think discussions of The Missing Heat have to do with the slowdown in global surface warming since the late 1990s, which wasn’t anticipated by climate modeling groups. The term Missing Heat, however, is not related to the slowdown in global surface warming. Missing Heat is used in discussions of the heat being stored in the depths of the oceans.
OVERVIEW    

In Chapter 1.10 – Introduction to Radiative Imbalance, I presented the modeled energy imbalance at the top of the atmosphere (TOA).  As you’ll recall, there was a very wide spread in the individual model simulations of the top-of-the-atmosphere energy imbalance.  (See Figure 1.10-3.)  I’ve shortened the timeframe to 1955-2015 in Figure 1.24-1, which is the period for which ocean heat content data are available from the NODC.
NOTE: Following an introduction to the concept of Earth’s energy imbalance, much of Chapter 1.10 – Introduction to Radiative Imbalance is based on the August 2015 post No Consensus: Earth’s Top of Atmosphere Energy Imbalance in CMIP5-Archived (IPCC AR5) Climate Models. [End note.]
Ponder that graph for a moment. The average top-of-the-atmosphere energy imbalance (red curve) in recent years is in the expected range…the range we’ve been told by the climate science community. Example:  According to Trenberth et al. (2014) Earth’s Energy Imbalance:
All estimates (OHC and TOA) show that over the past decade the energy imbalance ranges between about 0.5 and 1 Wm-2.
Trenberth et al. (2014) must not have been referring to the individual climate models, because they show a much larger range. In fact, some of the models show relatively high positive TOA energy imbalances, in the neighborhood of +2.5 watts/m^2, while others show negative energy imbalances, roughly -2.5 watts/m^2.
The simulated oceans in the models with the high positive top-of-the-atmosphere energy imbalances have to be accumulating heat at relatively fast rates.  On the other hand, the simulated oceans in the models with the negative top-of-the-atmosphere energy imbalances have to be losing heat very quickly.  Yes, losing heat.
In this chapter, we’re going to calculate and illustrate the ocean heat accumulation from 1955 to 2015 based on the climate-model-simulated top-of-the-atmosphere energy imbalances for all of the models included in the earlier energy imbalance chapter (Chapter 1.10). We’ll start with the full oceans compared to data for the top 2000 meters, and we’ll then compare models and data for the top 700 meters.
INTRODUCTION
Because the oceans to depth have a tremendous capacity to store heat, they are supposed to be storing about 93% of the excess heat created by the emissions of man-made greenhouse gases.  See Figure 1.24-2.

The pie chart in Figure 1.24-2 is based on the Earth’s total energy change inventory from Box 3.1 of Chapter 3 – Observations: Oceans of the IPCC’s 5th Assessment Report.  There they write:
Ocean warming dominates the total energy change inventory, accounting for roughly 93% on average from 1971 to 2010 (high confidence). The upper ocean (0-700 m) accounts for about 64% of the total energy change inventory. Melting ice (including Arctic sea ice, ice sheets and glaciers) accounts for 3% of the total, and warming of the continents 3%. Warming of the atmosphere makes up the remaining 1%.
Later in the chapter we’ll address the depths of 0-700 meters.
WE CAN USE THE MODELED ENERGY IMBALANCE AT THE TOP OF THE ATMOSPHERE TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH HEAT THE OCEANS SHOULD BE ACCUMULATING, ACCORDING TO THE MODELS
The ocean heat content outputs of the climate models stored in the Climate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) archive are not available in easy-to-use form at the KNMI Climate Explorer.  In fact, I know of no place where ocean heat content outputs are easy to access for any of the CMIP5-based models.
Fortunately, the components of the modeled Energy Imbalance at the Top of the Atmosphere (TOA) are available.  So we can determine the energy imbalance, and, in turn, how much heat the oceans should be storing, according to the models.  It’s commonly done, as you’ll see.
As you’ll recall from Chapter 1.10 – Introduction to Radiative Imbalance, the energy imbalance at the top of the atmosphere is made up of 3 components (nomenclature and acronym used at the KNMI Climate Explorer are shown in parentheses):

the amount of sunlight reaching the top of the atmosphere (TOA Incident Shortwave Radiation, rsdt),
the sunlight being reflected back to space primarily by clouds and volcanic aerosols (TOA Outgoing Shortwave Radiation, rsut), and
the infrared radiation being emitted by Earth relative to the top of the atmosphere (TOA Outgoing Longwave Radiation, rlut).

The top of the atmosphere energy imbalance is calculated by subtracting the Outgoing Shortwave and Longwave Radiation from Incident Shortwave Radiation.
Figure 1.24-3 presents the average top-of-the-atmosphere energy imbalance of the climate models stored in the CMIP5 archive, specifically the multi-model mean of the models using historic and RCP6.0 forcings. We’re discussing the multi-model mean now for simplicity sake…for those new to the topic.   The 1955 to 2015 timeframe relates to the NODC’s ocean heat content data for the depths 0-2000 meters (about 6600 feet or about 1.25 miles).

The large dips and rebounds in those model simulations are caused by the aerosols emitted into the stratosphere by explosive volcanic eruptions.
Each year that the top-of-the-atmosphere energy imbalance is positive, the oceans gain heat, and each year the top-of-the-atmosphere energy imbalance is negative, the oceans lose heat.  The energy imbalance is positive most of the time, so the modeled oceans should be warming to depth, according to the model mean.
Note:  You’ll notice in the title block of Figure 1.24-3 that I excluded three models: one CESM-CAM5 model and two IPSL models. There were shifts at 2006 in the TOA Outgoing Longwave Radiation outputs of all three runs of the CESM-CAM5 model (one with a monstrous shift), which skewed the multi-model mean of that metric for that scenario. (I notified KNMI of that problem, and NCAR has since corrected them. I’ve continued to exclude them so that the models in this chapter are the same in the top-of-the-atmosphere energy imbalance chapter.) I also excluded the two IPSL models because their top-of-the-atmosphere Incident Shortwave Radiation contains a volcanic aerosol component, while all other models do not. (The other models address volcanic aerosols with the Outgoing Shortwave Radiation.)
That leaves 21 models, including BCC-CSM1-1, BCC-CSM1-1-M, CCSM4 (6 runs), CSIRO-MK3-6-0 (10 runs), FIO-ESM (3 runs), GFDL-CM3, GFDL-ESM2G, GISS-E2-H p1, GISS-E2-H p2, GISS-E2-H p3, GISS-E2-R p1, GISS-E2-R p2, GISS-E2-R p3, HadGEM2-AO, HadGEM2-ES (3 runs), MIROC5 (3 runs), MIROC-ESM, MIROC-ESM-CHEM, MRI-CGCM3, NorESM1-M, and NorESM1-ME.
For those models with multiple runs, the ensemble members are averaged before being included in the multi-model mean.
[End note.]
CONVERTING FROM WATTS/M^2 TO JOULES*10^22/YEAR  
We’ll need to convert the units of the modeled top-of-the-atmosphere energy imbalance (watts/m^2) to those used for ocean heat content to the depths of 2000 meters (Joules * 10^22).
Apparently, the climate science community also uses TOA energy imbalance to determine ocean heat uptake.  Gavin Schmidt presented two conversion factors (the one he originally used in his model-data comparisons at RealClimate and the corrected one) in his post OHC Model/Obs Comparison Errata.   Dr. Schmidt writes:
My error was in assuming that the model output (which were in units W yr/m2) were scaled for the ocean area only, when in fact they were scaled for the entire global surface area (see fig. 2 in Hansen et al, 2005). Therefore, in converting to units of 1022 Joules for the absolute ocean heat content change, I had used a factor of 1.1 (0.7 x 5.1 x 365 x 3600 x 24 x 10-8), instead of the correct value of 1.61 (5.1 x 365 x 3600 x 24 x 10-8).
The paper Dr. Schmidt referenced is Hansen et al. (2005) Earth’s energy imbalance: Confirmation and implications. That papers notes:
Ocean heat storage. Confirmation of the planetary energy imbalance can be obtained by measuring the heat content of the ocean, which must be the principal reservoir for excess energy (3, 15). Levitus et al. (15) compiled ocean temperature data that yielded increased ocean heat content of about 10 W year/m2, averaged over the Earth’s surface, during 1955 to 1998 [1 W year/m2 over the full Earth ~ 1.61 x 1022 J…].
Referring back to Dr. Schmidt’s post at RealClimate, unfortunately, Gavin didn’t present the units for those factors. So let’s add the units:
1.61*10^22 Joules/year per watt/m^2 = (Earth’s surface area 5.1*10^14 m^2)*(365 days/year)*(3600 seconds/hour)*(24 hours/day)
We’ll make one more adjustment to the conversion factor.  We’ll assume the oceans are accumulating 93% of the top-of-the-atmosphere energy imbalance, which lowers the conversion factor to 1.50*10^22 Joules/year per watt/m^2.
MODELED ANNUAL OCEAN HEAT UPTAKE AND ACCUMULATION BASED ON THE MODEL MEAN (FULL OCEAN)
Based on that conversion factor, the annual modeled ocean heat uptake (absolute) for the full oceans that was derived from the simulated top-of-the-atmosphere energy imbalance are shown in Figure 1.24-4…again using the model mean to simplify these early discussions. Basically, Figure 1.24-4 illustrates the average of the modeled top-of-the-atmosphere energy imbalance but in terms used for ocean heat content.  Every year the value is positive, the oceans gain heat, and each year the value is negative, the oceans lose heat. The difference between an annual value and zero indicates how much heat the oceans gain or lose in a given year. In other words, the graph shows the annual ocean warming and cooling rates for the global oceans.

But that still doesn’t allow us to directly compare the models to the data. The (much-adjusted) global ocean heat content data from the NODC for the depths of 0-2000 meters are presenting how much heat the oceans are accumulating in the top 2000 meters.  To determine the modeled ocean heat accumulation, we simply take a running total (cumulative sum) of the annual heat uptake…like the balance in a bank account.  See Figure 1.24-5.

I’ve included the NODC ocean heat content reconstruction for the top 2000 meters (zeroed at 1957) in pentadal form as a reference for the (much-adjusted) observations. (Data here.)  The data have been shifted so that the 1957 value is zero. That was done solely to ease the visual comparisons.  Keep in mind, before the early 2000s when the ARGO floats were deployed, the NODC ocean heat content data for the top 2000 meters are based on very few temperature and salinity measurements.  Phrased differently, before the ARGO era, the NODC ocean heat content data to depths of 2000 meters are basically make-believe data. We’ll discuss and illustrate this in more detail in the future Part 2 of this book.
For the sake of discussion, we’ll assume there is no heat gain below 2000 meters. It’s commonly done. That is, we’ll assume all of the excess heat is being absorbed only in the top 2000 meters.   That’s consistent with the findings of Liang et al. (2015) Vertical Redistribution of Oceanic Heat Content. (See the preprint copy here.) In fact, Liang et al. found (1) the oceans below 2000 meters had cooled from 1992 to 2012 and (2) part of the heat above 2000 meters was from the redistribution of heat upwards from the depths below 2000 meters.  By assuming all of the observed heat gain is in the top 2000 meters, we can then compare the data to the model outputs, the latter of which are for the full ocean, from surface to floor.
With those things considered, it might be misleadingly said that the models, as represented by the model mean, do a reasonable job of simulating the observed warming rate of the oceans.  Why misleadingly?  As we’ve already shown (Figure 1.24-1), there is no agreement among the models on the energy imbalance at the top of the atmosphere, and that means there is no agreement among the models on how much heat the oceans are accumulating…if they are in fact accumulating and not losing heat in their modeled oceans.
MODELED ANNUAL OCEAN HEAT UPTAKE AND ACCUMULATION FOR ALL MODELS (FULL OCEAN)
Using the conversion factor presented earlier (1.50*10^22 Joules/year per watt/m^2), the annual heat uptake and losses (absolute) in modeled ocean heat content, for the full oceans, based on the simulated top-of-the-atmosphere energy imbalance from 1955 to 2015, are shown in Figure 1.24-6…this time for the model mean (in red) and the individual models stored in the CMIP5 archive using the historic and RCP6.0 forcings.  Again, in other words, Figure 1.24-6 illustrates the modeled energy imbalance of the individual models but in the terms used for ocean heat content, which is why it looks so similar to Figure 1.24-1.

The simulated oceans in the models with higher absolute positive values are gaining heat faster than those whose energy imbalances are closer to zero. And the oceans in the models with the negative imbalances from 1955 to 2015 are not accumulating heat; they’re losing it.
The models with the high positive imbalances and with the negative imbalances are obvious outliers.  They create remarkable ocean heat content curves that should probably be considered implausible. See Figure 1.24-7. Yet they are among the models used by the IPCC for their 5th Assessment Report.  Then again, if we were to eliminate models because they didn’t simulate some metric properly, there would be no climate models left in the CMIP archives.

Obviously, based on the climate models used by the IPCC for their 5th Assessment Report, there is no agreement on how much heat the oceans should be accumulating, or even if the oceans are accumulating heat, based on their energy imbalances.   And the differences in the simulated ocean heat accumulation are so great that using the model mean to represent the models is very misleading.
THE IPCC’S PRESENTATION IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT
Figure 1.24-8 is Figure 9.17 from Chapter 9 – Evaluation of Climate Models from the IPCC’s 5th Assessment Report.  The middle graph, Cell b, corresponds to my Figure 1.24-7 above. Surprisingly, there are few similarities between the two presentations.  The primary difference between the IPCC’s and my comparison graphs of ocean heat accumulation is that the IPCC has adjusted the climate model outputs in its graph.  I’ve underlined in red the sentence where the IPCC states that in the caption.  It reads:
Simulation drift has been removed from all CMIP5 runs with a contemporaneous portion of a quadratic fit to each corresponding pre-industrial control run (Gleckler et al., 2012).

UPDATE:  Nic Lewis advises on the thread of the cross post at WUWT that Figure 9.17 from the IPCC’s 5th Assessment Report had been in error and that they issued a correction for it in the IPCC’s errata for that report. My Figure 1.24-8 above includes the original illustration that was in error. (Link to all corrected illustrations are here, and the corrected Figure 9.17 is here.) The corrected graphs from their Figure 9.17 are included in my Figure 1.24-8 Supplement.

Figure 1.24-8 Supplement
The corrections appear to have changed only the red “CMIP5 mean” curves, raising them so that they are now greater than the observations. Thanks, Nic.
That does not alter the fact that the IPCC’s illustration bears no resemblance to my Figure 1.24-7.
[End Update.]
Note: Climate model “drift” is, basically, a phenomenon where the climate model outputs can change with time even if the inputs were to be kept constant. The problem is discussed in Sen Gupta et al. (2013) Climate Drift in CMIP5 Models (paywalled).  The abstract reads (my boldface):
Climate models often exhibit spurious long-term changes independent of either internal variability or changes to external forcing. Such changes, referred to as model “drift,” may distort the estimate of forced change in transient climate simulations. The importance of drift is examined in comparison to historical trends over recent decades in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP). Comparison based on a selection of metrics suggests a significant overall reduction in the magnitude of drift from phase 3 of CMIP (CMIP3) to phase 5 of CMIP (CMIP5). The direction of both ocean and atmospheric drift is systematically biased in some models introducing statistically significant drift in globally averaged metrics. Nevertheless, for most models globally averaged drift remains weak compared to the associated forced trends and is often smaller than the difference between trends derived from different ensemble members or the error introduced by the aliasing of natural variability. An exception to this is metrics that include the deep ocean (e.g., steric sea level) where drift can dominate in forced simulations. In such circumstances drift must be corrected for using information from concurrent control experiments. Many CMIP5 models now include ocean biogeochemistry. Like physical models, biogeochemical models generally undergo long spinup integrations to minimize drift. Nevertheless, based on a limited subset of models, it is found that drift is an important consideration and must be accounted for. For properties or regions where drift is important, the drift correction method must be carefully considered. The use of a drift estimate based on the full control time series is recommended to minimize the contamination of the drift estimate by internal variability.
In other words, because of model flaws, climate model outputs are adjusted by climate scientists when simulating the deep oceans.  Let’s rephrase that:  Because of inherent flaws in climate models, when examining model performance, climate scientists will adjust the outputs of climate models before comparing them to data.   How bizarre is that?
LET’S RETURN TO OUR TOA ENERGY IMBALANCE-BASED OCEAN HEAT CONTENT AND ELIMINATE THE OUTLIERS (FULL OCEAN)
Three of the 21 models in Figure 3.24-7 are showing way too much heat accumulation, and 5 of the models show the oceans losing heat because of their negative TOP-OF-THE-ATMOSPHERE energy imbalances.  They are so far from the much-adjusted observations I’ve excluded them in Figure 1.24-9.

But eliminating the outliers creates other problems for the models.  With the obvious outliers removed, not one of the remaining 13 models has an ocean heat content trend that’s lower than the observed trend.  In other words, all of the models are showing too much warming.  And that means, for most the remaining models, the climate sensitivities to CO2 are too high.
With the outliers removed, according to the model mean, the models are showing a heat accumulation that’s more than 2 times higher than observed.
WHAT ABOUT THE GISS MODEL E2 SIMULATIONS FROM THE CMIP5 ARCHIVE (FULL OCEAN)?
For a number of years, Gavin Schmidt (the director of the Goddard Institute of Space Studies, GISS) presented model-data comparisons at RealClimate that included simulated and observed ocean heat content for different depths. Gavin compared models and data for the depths of 0-700 meters in the posts that appeared in December 2009, May 2010, January 2011 and February 2012. It was only in the last post that Dr. Schmidt presented the comparison for the modeled full ocean and data for 0-2000 meters. We’ll illustrate the model-data comparison for the top 700 meters in a moment, but let’s first stick with the data for the top 2000 meters and the modeled ocean heat accumulation for the full oceans.
You’ll note that the ocean heat content graphs in those RealClimate posts have been corrected per Gavin’s May 2012 post OHC Model/Obs Comparison Errata.  The ocean heat content comparisons in them used the GISS models from the earlier CMIP3 archive.   Gavin Schmidt closed his errata post with:
Analyses of the CMIP5 models will provide some insight here since the historical simulations have been extended to 2012 (including the last solar minimum), and have updated aerosol emissions. Watch this space.
I suspect some of you, like me, have been patiently waiting for those CMIP5-archived GISS Model E2-based model-data comparisons for ocean heat content.  Yet, for more than four years, none have been posted at RealClimate.
For those interested, Figure 1.24-10 compares the data with the top-of-the-atmosphere energy imbalance-based ocean heat content for the three GISS Model E2-R simulations…along with the mean of those 3 runs. The “R” suffix letter stands for the Russell Ocean model that’s coupled to the GISS Model E.

This batch of GISS climate models is showing that they are too sensitive to CO2 by a wide amount.  The modeled heat accumulation shown by the model mean of this GISS model more than doubles that shown by the data.
Looking at the legends in Figures 1.24-6, -7 and -9, you’ll note that GISS also has another group of model experiments with an “H” suffix.  The “H” stands for HYCOM ocean.  Figure 1.24-11 includes the model-data comparison of the GISS models with the HYCOM oceans.

Once again, the GISS models show they are way too sensitive to CO2.  The model mean of this GISS model shows a heat accumulation that’s more than twice the observations.
I’ll let you speculate about why there have been no model-data comparisons of ocean heat content at RealClimate for 4 years.
MODEL-DATA FOR 0-700 METERS
We’ll be using the annual NODC ocean heat content data (0-700m) here in the following comparisons. For the comparisons I’ve simply shifted the data so that the 1955 value is zero.
There is better sampling at the depths of 0-700 meters than at 700-2000 meters before the ARGO era, so the NODC ocean heat content data for the depths of 0-700 meters is a better dataset.  While sampling at these upper depths may be better globally, they were still very poor in the southern hemisphere before the deployment of the ARGO floats. With that in mind…
For these comparisons we’ll rely on the IPCC’s statement that “The upper ocean (0-700 m) accounts for about 64% of the total energy change inventory…” from the earlier quote. That is, we’re taking the scaling factor (1.61*10^22 Joules/year per watt/m^2) and multiplying it by 0.64 to determine the annual ocean heat content uptake for the top 700 meters of the oceans from the top-of-the-atmosphere energy imbalance. The following are the pertinent graphs without commentary, because the comments would basically be the same as those for the full oceans.

CLOSING
The energy imbalance at the top of the atmosphere and ocean heat accumulation are crucial elements in the hypothesis of human-induced global warming. Because there is no agreement among the climate models about the energy imbalance at the top of the atmosphere (Figure 1.24-1), there can be no agreement among the climate models about the heat accumulating in the oceans (Figures 1.24-7 and 1.24-14).
With the unlikely outliers removed, or referring to the GISS Model E2-R and GISS Model E2-H simulations, the differences between the observed and modeled ocean heat accumulation indicate the models are much too sensitive to the hypothetical impacts of CO2.
With the outliers removed, according to the model mean, the models are showing a heat accumulation that’s more than twice the observed heat accumulation for the depths of 0-700 meters and for the full oceans.  And depending on the GISS climate model and depth, the modeled heat accumulation can be two to almost three times higher than what has been observed.
In the models used by the IPCC for their 5th Assessment Report, many of the modeled oceans are not storing heat close to the (much-adjusted) observed rates, so those models are not simulating global warming as it exists on Earth.  But there’s really nothing new about that. We can simply add ocean heat accumulation and top-of-the-atmosphere energy imbalance to the list of things that climate models do not simulate properly: like surface temperatures, like precipitation, like polar sea ice, like polar amplification, like El Niño and La Niña processes, like the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, like the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and so on.
Once again, climate models have shown they are good for one thing and one thing only: to display how poorly they simulate Earth’s climate.
Important Note:  As discussed, because of inherent flaws in climate models like model drift, when examining model performance, climate scientists will adjust the outputs of climate models before comparing them to data.
THANKS
This chapter is based on my blog post Climate Models Fail: Global Ocean Heat Content (Based on TOA Energy Imbalance).  As you’ll note in that post, I purposely used the wrong scaling factor for converting the top-of-the-atmosphere energy imbalance to ocean heat uptake. I did that because I found it odd that the trends of the observations aligned almost perfectly with the trends of the model mean for the full oceans and for the top 700 meters.  While it’s likely only a coincidence, it appeared as though the models were tuned to the wrong scaling factor.
Many thanks to Willis Eschenbach and Roger Pielke, Sr. for their comments on the initial (but much different) drafts of that blog post and to researcher Nic Lewis for his comments on the thread of the cross post at WattsUpWithThat.
ABOUT THE ERRONEOUS TRENDS LISTED ON THE BOOK ILLUSTRATIONS
I noted above that this chapter was based on the blog post Climate Models Fail: Global Ocean Heat Content (Based on TOA Energy Imbalance), where I had purposely used the wrong scaling factor for converting the top-of-the-atmosphere energy imbalance to ocean heat uptake. If you were to compare the trends shown in that original blog post to the trends listed in Chapter 1.24 of my ebook On Global Warming and the Illusion of Control – Part 1, you’d note that I updated some of the trends in the book, but not all.  My apologies.
The trends listed on the illustrations in this post fall into line with what we would expect when compared to the trends listed in the original post. That is, they are approximately 1.41 times higher.
NEXT IN THE SERIES
We’re going to take a look at the 8 outlying climate models presented in this post and discuss an important aspect of their outputs.

"WASHINGTON  —   The Trump administration is preparing a sweeping executive order that would clear the way for the C. I. A. to reopen overseas “black site” prisons, like those where it detained and tortured terrorism suspects before former President Barack Obama shut them down. President Trump’s   draft order, titled “Detention and Interrogation of Enemy Combatants” and obtained by The New York Times, would also undo many of the other restrictions on handling detainees that Mr. Obama put in place in response to policies of the George W. Bush administration. If Mr. Trump signs the draft order, he would also revoke Mr. Obama’s directive to give the International Committee of the Red Cross access to all detainees in American custody. That would be another step toward reopening secret prisons outside of the normal wartime rules established by the Geneva Conventions, although statutory obstacles would remain. Mr. Obama tried to close the prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, and refused to send new detainees there, but the draft order directs the Pentagon to continue using the site “for the detention and trial of newly captured” detainees  —   including not just more people suspected of being members of Al Qaeda or the Taliban, like the 41 remaining detainees, but also Islamic State detainees. It does not address legal problems that might raise. The draft order does not direct any immediate reopening of C. I. A. prisons or revival of torture tactics, which are now banned by statute. But it sets up   policy reviews to make further recommendations in both areas to Mr. Trump, who vowed during the campaign to bring back waterboarding and a “hell of a lot worse”  —   not only because “torture works,” but because even “if it doesn’t work, they deserve it anyway. ” Elisa Massimino, the director of Human Rights First, denounced the draft order as “flirting with a return to the ‘enhanced interrogation program’ and the environment that gave rise to it. ” She noted that numerous retired military leaders have rejected torture as “illegal, immoral and damaging to national security,” and she said that many of Mr. Trump’s cabinet nominees had seemed to share that view in their confirmation testimony. “It would be surprising and extremely troubling if the national security cabinet officials were to acquiesce in an order like that after the assurances that they gave in their confirmation hearings,” she said. A White House spokesman did not immediately respond to an email inquiring about the draft order, including when Mr. Trump may intend to sign it. But the order was accompanied by a   statement that criticized the Obama administration for having “refrained from exercising certain authorities” about detainees it said were critical to defending the country from “radical Islamism. ” Specifically, the draft order would revoke two executive orders about detainees that Mr. Obama issued in January 2009, shortly after his inauguration. One was Mr. Obama’s directive to close the Guantánamo prison and the other was his directive to end C. I. A. prisons, grant Red Cross access to all detainees and limit interrogators to the Army Field Manual techniques. In their place, Mr. Trump’s draft order would resurrect a 2007 executive order issued by President Bush. It responded to a 2006 Supreme Court ruling about the Geneva Conventions that had put C. I. A. interrogators at risk of prosecution for war crimes, leading to a temporary halt of the agency’s “enhanced” interrogations program. Mr. Bush’s 2007 order enabled the agency to resume a form of the program by specifically listing what sorts of prisoner abuses counted as war crimes. That made it safe for interrogators to use other tactics, like extended sleep deprivation, that were not on the list. Mr. Obama revoked that order as part of his 2009 overhaul of detention legal policy. One of the Obama orders Mr. Trump’s draft order would revoke also limited interrogators to using techniques listed in the Army Field Manual. But in 2015, Congress enacted a statute locking down that rule as a matter of law, as well as a requirement to let the Red Cross visit detainees. Those limits would remain in place for the time being. Still, the draft order says   Trump administration officials should conduct several reviews and make recommendations to Mr. Trump. One was whether to change the field manual, to the extent permitted by law. Another was “whether to reinitiate a program of interrogation of   alien terrorists to be operated outside the United States” by the C. I. A. including any “legislative proposals” necessary to permit the resumption of such a program. It was not clear whether the C. I. A. would be enthusiastic about resuming a role in detaining and interrogating terrorism suspects after its scorching experience over the past decade. In written answers to questions by the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mr. Trump’s C. I. A. director, Mike Pompeo, said he would review whether a rewrite of the field manual was needed and left the door open to seeking a change in the law “if experts believed current law was an impediment to gathering vital intelligence to protect the country. ” Mr. Trump’s order says no detainee should be tortured or otherwise subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment “as prescribed by U. S. law,” but it makes no mention of international law commitments binding the United States to adhere to humane standards even if Congress were to relax domestic legal limits on interrogations, such as the Convention Against Torture or the Geneva Conventions. Another core national security legal principle for Mr. Obama was to use civilian courts, not military commissions, whenever possible in terrorism cases  —   and to exclusively use civilian law enforcement agencies and procedures, not the military, to handle cases arising on domestic soil. The draft order also signals that the Trump administration may shift that approach as well. In 2012, after Congress enacted a statute mandating that the military initially take custody of all foreign Qaeda suspects, Mr. Obama issued a directive that   waived that rule for most domestic circumstances, such as if the F. B. I. had arrested the suspect and was already in the process of an interrogation. But Mr. Trump’s draft order calls for the attorney general, in consultation with other   officials, to review that directive and recommend modifications to it within 120 days. Many Republicans  —   including Senator Jeff Sessions, Mr. Trump’s attorney general nominee  —   criticized the Obama administration’s approach as weak, even though the civilian court system has regularly convicted terrorists at trial while the military commissions system has proved to be dysfunctional. During the campaign, Mr. Trump said he would prefer to prosecute terrorism suspects at Guantánamo  —   including American citizens, although the law currently limits the commissions system to foreign defendants. Against that backdrop, Mr. Trump’s draft order would direct Defense Secretary James N. Mattis, along with the attorney general and the director of national intelligence, to “review the military commissions system and recommend to the president how best to employ the system going forward to provide for the swift and just trial and punishment of unlawful enemy combatants detained in the armed conflict with violent Islamist extremists. ” Tom Malinowski, who was assistant secretary of state for human rights in the Obama administration, said the draft order showed that everyone who thought the office of the presidency or the advice of cabinet secretaries like Mr. Mattis would temper Mr. Trump “is being shown wrong again. ” “He’ll listen to his worst instincts over his best advisers unless restrained by law,” Mr. Malinowski said."

Guest Opinion; Dr. Tim Ball
Scientists lost the scientific script somewhere in the 20th century. The major loss involved the fact that correlation is not cause and effect. It was lost for several reasons:

Failure to know or consistently apply scientific methods;
Lack of ethics as the end justifies the means;
Methods and process are not taught or emphasized;
People are more willing to bypass or ignore everything for funding;
Too many are willing to subjugate or exploit research for a political agenda;
Achieving results to advance a career is more important;
A person gets caught up in Groupthink as they go along to get along;
and scientists are unwilling to look to themselves to stop the rot.

All of these reasons were on display in the leaked emails from the Climatic Research Unit (CRU).
An example of the problem of correlation occurred recently on TV screen when a medical doctor was asked about the research evidence for a claim about the relationship between two phenomena. The interviewer clearly wanted to know about the cause/effect proof. The doctor replied that there was an “association” between them. Did the doctor know that this is just another word for correlation and that it must not be substituted for cause and effect? Who knows? All I know is the news is replete with claims of correlations implying cause and effect. It is undermining the credibility of science.
When teaching climatology, it is imperative to warn of the dangers of correlation and auto-correlation. My favorite example is that doctors cause cancer because almost everyone with cancer visited a doctor. Others like the claim that diet drinks cause obesity because more obese people drink diet drinks than any other group. So much of statistics applied to weather data for climate reconstructions involves basic techniques such as the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient that produce the Pearson’s r value. This r value was central to the debate about the validity of the ‘hockey stick’ as Steve McIntyre explained. It is also imperative to teach that when reconstructing past climates more than two independent proxy sources are required to have any confidence in the results and that a minimum of two station records are necessary to determine relative homogeneity.
The trouble is that in climate science malfeasance and abandonment of proper science is more pervasive. Over the year’s media and others challenged me arguing that by questioning anthropogenic global warming (AGW) I gave comfort to the polluters. Initially it concerned me, then several years ago I shifted my concerns about opposing because I realized that the greater threat was in lying and misleading, especially by scientists. Once the public realizes they are lied to, the polluters have much better ammunition. Aesop (620 – 564 BCE) explained the dangers of ‘crying wolf’. Science, and especially climate science, reached that point several years ago, but it is still not fully revealed.
The media is replete with scientists speculating and reaching cause and effect conclusions when there is only a correlation. But this is only a minor part of the overall malaise in science and nowhere is it more apparent than in climate science. It is seven years since Climategate, but the evidence of wrongdoing existed at least 21 years ago with the “Chapter 8” fiasco in the 1995 IPCC Report. It is 50 years since bad science appeared in climatology and, sadly, it continues, but few know the history.
I was as opposed to the threats of doom associated with global cooling in the 1970s because it was bad science as I am today about warming. Compare the similarities of impending doom in Lowell Ponte’s 1976 book The Cooling with what alarmists are saying today.
“It is cold fact: the global cooling presents humankind with the most important social, political, and adaptive challenge we have had to deal with for ten thousand years. Your stake in the decisions we make concerning it is of ultimate importance; the survival of ourselves, our children, our species.”
 
Change the seventh-word “cooling” to warming and it is the same hysteria designed to panic people and prevent logic, but 180 degrees removed. One promoter of the book wrote,
“The dramatic importance of climate changes to the worlds future has been dangerously underestimated by many, often because we have been lulled by modern technology into thinking we have conquered nature. But this well-written book points out in clear language that the climatic threat could be as awesome as any we might face, and that massive worldwide actions to hedge against that threat deserve immediate consideration. At a minimum, public awareness of the possibilities must commence, and Lowell Ponte’s provocative work is a good place to start.”
These words of warning exploited the false threat of cooling were written by Stephen Schneider, the person who became the major spokesperson of global warming just a few years later. The IPCC dedicated the Synthesis Report of the Fifth Assessment Report to him. They wrote,
“Steve Schneider, born in New York, trained as a plasma physicist, embraced scholarship in the field of climate science almost 40 years ago and continued his relentless efforts creating new knowledge in the field and informing policymakers and the public at large on the growing problem of climate change and solutions for dealing with it. At all times Steve Schneider remained intrepid and forthright in expressing his views. His convictions were driven by the strength of his outstanding scientific expertise.”
“Lead Author, Coordinating Lead Author and Expert Reviewer for various Assessment Reports and a member of the Core Writing Team for the Synthesis Report of the Fourth Assessment Report (FAR). His life and accomplishments have inspired and motivated members of the Core Writing Team of this Report.”
The IPCC brought him back to help write the deceitful FAR Synthesis Report because of the disasters exposed by Climategate and the collapse of the Kyoto Protocol. He explained why he was the perfect person for the job in a 1989 Discovery magazine article.
“On the one hand we are ethically bound to the scientific method, in effect promising to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but, which means that we must include all the doubts, caveats, ifs and buts. On the other hand, we are not just scientists, but human beings as well. And like most people, we’d like to see the world a better place, which in this context translates into our working to reduce the risk of potentially disastrous climate change. To do that we have to get some broad-based support, to capture the publics imagination. That, of course, entails getting loads of media coverage. So we have to offer up scary scenarios, make simplified, dramatic statements, and make little mention of any doubts we might have. This double ethical bind which we frequently find ourselves in cannot be solved by any formula. Each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest.”
No, we don’t have to decide. There is no ethical dilemma, there can only be honesty and the truth. As Thomas Jefferson explained,
“It is error alone which needs the support of government. Truth can stand by itself.”
Of course, it is a struggle as George Washington said,
“Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.”
Look at Schneider’s opening words about truth. He then sets aside the essential basis of science and his conscience, for a political agenda.
The IPCC was never about science. People directly involved in the process say so. They are people that Schneider likely communicated with in preparing the FAR Synthesis Report. As the IPCC dedication states,
“Steve Schneider’s knowledge was a rare synthesis of several disciplines which are an essential part of the diversity inherent in climate science.”
Here is what former United Nations climate official Ottmar Edenhofer, who co-chaired the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change working group on Mitigation of Climate Change from 2008 to 2015 said.
“One has to free oneself from the illusion that international climate policy is environmental policy. This has almost nothing to do with the environmental policy anymore, with problems such as deforestation or the ozone hole,” “We redistribute de facto the world’s wealth by climate policy,”
Schneider likely knew, or should have known about Christiana Figueres, Executive Secretary of U.N.’s Framework Convention on Climate Change, who said.
“This is the first time in the history of mankind that we are setting ourselves the task of intentionally, within a defined period of time, to change the economic development model that has been reigning for at least 150 years, since the Industrial Revolution,”
There were other comments available from the start. For example, there was Senator Timothy Wirth’s 1993 remark.
“We’ve got to ride the global warming issue. Even if the theory of global warming is wrong, we will be doing the right thing …”
The problem is there is no intellectual or scientific consistency in Schneider’s swing from promoting the threat of global cooling and just a few years later promoting warming. The shift in thinking in the 1970s saw climatology, and statistics as generally applied to society, expand from determining the average to considering simple linear trends. Cooling trend proponents, including Schneider, assumed that the trend would continue. He had to know as founder and editor of Climatic Change that climate varies considerably all the time, and current variations were well within natural variability. In 1997, I submitted a book review at his request. He converted it into an editorial essay that appeared in Volume 35, 361-365. It spoke to the problems and limitations of climate science. As I wrote, but apparently Schneider overlooked,
“Even cursory study of the climate record indicates that dramatic changes are the norm.”
Day by day the public are fed a steady diet of correlations linking an endless series of unsubstantiated events. Many of them trigger policy, political or financial opportunism, and a multitude of regulations giving control of people to politicians and faceless bureaucrats. Consider this example.
“A new study suggests that low-salt diets might actually be dangerous for your health and that high salt intake is only detrimental to those with high blood pressure.”
 
The media is full of stories like this that contradict previous firmly–held views that influenced medicine, business, government, and people’s daily lives. No wonder people are losing faith in science. Dutch researchers are already examining the possible consequence of iodized salt reduction and the return of goiter.
It is possible governments are cutting funding partly because of growing concern about such corruption and credibility of science. Some scientists are fighting back. One group are campaigning with the slogan
“Science is again threatened with cuts: help us tell the government that science is vital.”
Maybe these scientists are confronted with the challenge posed by Joseph Krutch.
“Though many have tried, no one has ever yet explained away the decisive fact that science, which can do so much, cannot decide what it ought to do.”
 
In the current situation the decision is obvious – look to yourselves. It is scientists who, for a variety of reasons all of them unacceptable, abandoned the rigors science demands. As Thomas Huxley said,
Sit down before fact as a little child, be prepared to give up every preconceived notion, follow humbly whatever and to whatever abyss nature leads, or you shall learn nothing.
The enemy, as always, is within, but so is the solution.

"**Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam has said the government will ""seriously reflect"" after local elections saw massive gains by pro-democracy candidates.**
Seventeen of the 18 district councils are now controlled by pro-democracy councillors, according to local media.
The election, the first since the wave of anti-Beijing protests began, saw an unprecedented turnout of more than 71%.
It is being seen as a stinging rebuke of Ms Lam's leadership and a show of support for the protest movement.
Hong Kong has seen months of increasingly violent protests since Ms Lam tried to introduce a controversial bill enabling extradition to China.
In a statement released online on Monday, Ms Lam said the government respected the results.
She said many felt the results reflected ""people's dissatisfaction with the current situation and the deep-seated problems in society"".
The government would ""listen to the opinions of members of the public humbly and seriously reflect"", she said.
Some 2.94 million people voted in the election, compared with 1.4 million in 2015.
Pro-democracy candidates won close to 60% of the total vote on Sunday, but achieved a landslide in terms of seats because of the first-past-the-post system, local media report.
Pro-democracy contenders were victorious in 347 of the 452 district council seats up for grabs; pro-Beijing candidates won 60 seats; while independents - many of them pro-democracy - got 45, according to the South China Morning Post.
In the last election four years ago, pro-Beijing councillors won 298 seats, but the distribution of these seats meant they took control of all 18 district councils.
They retained control of only the Islands District Council after Sunday's vote.
The territory's district councillors have little political power and mainly deal with local issues such as bus routes and rubbish collection, so the district elections do not normally generate such interest.
But the councillors also get to choose 117 of their number to sit on the 1,200-member committee that selects Hong Kong's chief executive, who is then formally appointed by the Chinese government.
The landslide results mean all of those 117 seats are now likely to go to pro-democracy candidates, so they will have a greater influence over that decision, which is set to be made in 2022.
But the result is also highly symbolic, as it was the first opportunity for people to express at the ballot box their view of Ms Lam's handling of the crisis.
The government, and China's leaders in Beijing, had been hoping the election would bring a show of support from the so-called ""silent majority"" which they say disapproves of the protests.
But that did not materialise - instead some high-profile pro-Beijing candidates lost their seats as voters backed pro-democracy candidates.
The hope from activists is that the overwhelming victory of anti-establishment parties will force the government to take their demands more seriously.
UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said he welcomed the holding of the elections, which he described as ""an important opportunity for the people of Hong Kong to make their voices heard"".
""There is now an opportunity to find a way through the crisis with political dialogue that reflects the legitimate aspirations of the people of Hong Kong and respects the one country two systems model,"" he said.
**By Jonathan Head, BBC News, Hong Kong**
So what now? Will the protests resume? It seems almost certain they will, unless the government starts responding to protesters' demands.
Carrie Lam has acknowledged that the results show dissatisfaction with her administration, and promised to listen in a spirit of humility. But she can only make concessions if China agrees. Beijing may prefer to see her replaced by a less toxic figure.
But there are challenges too for the opposition. The new intake of young councillors will have to take on the responsibility of addressing local concerns, like public transport and other amenities, rather than the grander ideals of democracy.
They will need to work together more effectively than they have in the past, and work out how the demands and tactics of more radical protesters can most effectively be channelled to get concessions from a Chinese central government unnerved by yet another show of defiance in Hong Kong.
There has been no official comment from Beijing. But Foreign Minister Wang Yi, speaking in Japan, reiterated that ""no matter what happens, Hong Kong is a part of China"".
""Any attempt to mess up Hong Kong, or even damage its prosperity and stability, will not succeed,"" he said.
State media outlets have been cautious in reporting the results.
State news agency Xinhua reported the votes had been counted, but did not detail the results. It said ""some rioters harassed patriotic candidates"" on election day, and that the ""most pressing task for Hong Kong at present is still to bring the violence and chaos to an end and restore order"".
Meanwhile, the English edition of state-backed tabloid Global Times attributed the result to the ""abnormal"" circumstances which made it easier for the pro-democracy camp to mobilise their voters.
It also alleged that ""Western forces"" have been supporting the opposition.
Ahead of the vote, state media had been urging people to vote for stability and against the unrest.
Hong Kong, once a British colony, is part of China, but it has some autonomy and people have more rights than on the mainland
That special status is set to expire in 2047, and many in Hong Kong do not want to become ""another Chinese city"".
The current protests started in June against a planned law which would have cleared the way for criminal suspects to be extradited to the mainland. Many feared this would undermine the city's freedoms or be used to silence anti-Beijing voices.
The bill was withdrawn in September, but demonstrations continued.
Clashes between police and activists have become increasingly violent, with police firing live bullets and protesters attacking officers with bows and arrows or throwing petrol bombs.
The demands of the protesters, mostly young people, have expanded to include genuine universal suffrage and an inquiry into allegations of police brutality."

For as long as I can remember, fusion power has been “tantalisingly close”, with the “breakthrough” due at any moment and practically limitless, clean power “just around the corner”. I’m not admitting how many spins I’ve notched up around the Sun, but let me just say that I remember when digital watches were pretty exciting.



So, forgive me if I cock a sceptical eyebrow whenever I read about a revolutionary new development in fusion technology. Still, it took Edison 10 000 goes to finally figure out how to make a lightbulb, so we can live in hope that workable fusion technology might become a reality in time to power our flying cars.



One such “promising approach” is allegedly in development in Australia.



Australian scientists are tantalisingly close to developing the holy grail of clean energy, using high-powered lasers to fuse boron and hydrogen atoms together to generate electricity without any emissions or toxic waste.



A team of scientists at the University of NSW is developing the ­hydrogen-boron fusion technol­ogy, which is said to hold the promise of limitless, cheap baseload electricity with virtually no carbon ­dioxide emissions and zero radioactive waste. The only waste product is helium.



Helium is such a useful element that “waste product” seems a misnomer.



The pioneer of the technology, **Heinrich Hora** , said: “The clean and absolutely safe reactor can be placed within densely populated areas, with no possibility of a catastrophic meltdown such as that which has been seen with ­nuclear fission reactors.” Boron is cheap and naturally abundant, with sufficient known reserves to power the world for thousands of years.



Patents for the technology have been granted in the US, Japan and China to UNSW spin-out company HB11 Energy.



This development is coming just in time to join the [Morrison government’s “technology target” ](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/02/morrison-delivers-on-emissions-while-others-just-talk/)approach to practical climate change action.



The announcement by UNSW of progress on its fusion research coincides with a new focus by the Morrison government on technology to combat climate change[…]



The government is planning to release a technology road map that will include advances in carbon­ capture and storage and other emissions technologies. Work is also progressing on a coal-to-hydrogen project based on Victoria’s brown coal reserves, with delivery of a hydrogen refin­ing plant to AGL’s Loy Yang facility in the Latrobe Valley.



Most approaches to fusion have been hampered by the difficulty of coping with the staggering temperatures and pressures involved, as well as the basic problem of producing more energy than it takes to trigger a fusion reaction (the fusion-powered H-bomb, for instance, uses a standard fission nuclear bomb as the **trigger** ).



Professor Hora said advances in laser technology had been the key to realising his theories of how to produce fusion energy without the massive amounts of heat needed by other approaches.



The laser technology’s developers, **Donna Strickland** and **Gerard Mourou** , were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2018[…]Professor Hora said his react­or design was simple: a largely empty metal sphere, where a modestly sized HB11 fuel pellet is held in the centre, with apertures for the two lasers. One laser establishes the magnetic containment field for the plasma and the second triggers the “avalanche” fusion chain reaction.



A statement by UNSW said the alpha particles generated by the reaction would create an electrical flow that could be channelled almost directly into an existing power grid with no need for a heat exchanger or steam turbine­ generator.



 **Personally, I’m not going to get too excited just yet, but…**



For all the caterwauling of Extinction Rebellion activists, nothing we possess right now is even remotely feasible as a replacement for fossil fuels. I have no doubt that humanity will eventually move on from fossil fuels, just as we abandoned horses and carts – but wind, solar, tidal and geothermal just won’t cut it. **What is needed is a genuinely transformational technology, as revolutionary as the internal combustion engine.**



If this new technology works, it may just be the golden key.

"In 2010, Great Britain generated 75% of its electricity from coal and natural gas. But by the end of the decade*, these fossil fuels accounted for just 40%, with coal generation collapsing from the decade’s peak of 41% in 2012 to under 2% in 2019. The near disappearance of coal power – the second most prevalent source in 2010 – underpinned a remarkable transformation of Britain’s electricity generation over the last decade, meaning Britain now has the cleanest electrical supply it has ever had. Second place now belongs to wind power, which supplied almost 21% of the country’s electrical demand in 2019, up from 3% in 2010. As at the start of the decade, natural gas provided the largest share of Britain’s electricity in 2019 at 38%, compared with 47% in 2010.  As we predicted last January, 2019 saw the annual total for coal generation drop below solar and into seventh place for the first time. Britain’s renewables also generated more electricity than coal and natural gas combined over a month for the first ever time in August. 


      Read more:
      Britain has shifted 30% of its electricity away from fossil fuels in just nine years


 Besides the reduction in carbon emissions, there was another remarkable shift in Britain’s electrical system during the 2010s. The amount of electricity consumed fell by nearly 15% between 2010 and 2019, with the economy using 50 terawatt hours (TWh) less electricity in 2019 than it did in 2010. That’s enough electricity to power half of Britain’s cars and taxis, if they were all electric vehicles. Some of this reduction can be attributed to greater energy efficiency, such as more LED lighting, and the fact that more goods were imported, rather than manufactured within Britain. With wages stagnant since 2010, it’s likely that lower economic demand also contributed. The rise of renewable generation and the fall in electrical demand allowed coal power to be transitioned off the system. Britain’s electrical grid was coal-free for over 3,700 hours in 2019, something that would have been unthinkable ten years ago. Wind energy set a new record of 26.5% for December 2019’s generation in the UK. Including solar, hydroelectric and biomass, renewables provided nearly 37% of the month’s electricity overall, with wind energy reaching a peak of nearly 17 gigawatts (GW) during the afternoon of December 10.  Since August 2018, renewables have produced more electricity than nuclear power for 17 months straight. Nuclear fell to less than a fifth of electricity generation in 2019, its lowest level since 2008 due to extended maintenance periods at six nuclear power stations. This helped the annual output of wind energy to surpass nuclear for the first time in 2019. But the 2020s will prove an even greater challenge for decarbonisation, not least as Britain’s economy is still heavily dependent on fossil fuels for transport, heating and hot water. Sales of electric vehicles in Britain are accelerating, with a quarter of a million now on Britain’s roads – but how to decarbonise heating is still up for debate. Encouragingly, due to cleaner electricity, a major milestone for electric heating is likely to have been reached in 2019. Using electricity from the grid to heat buildings or hot water is less carbon intensive than burning natural gas to get one kilowatt hour (kWh) of heat from a modern gas boiler. This means that even a simple electric heater releases on average less carbon than burning natural gas. But since natural gas demand varies greatly over a day and between seasons compared to the demand for electricity, a wholesale shift from natural gas to electricity is a significant challenge. Using low-carbon gases such as hydrogen is one option to decarbonise Britain’s heat supply, so too are electric heat pumps. Without a sustained focus on shifting heat and the transport sector from fossil fuels, Britain will fail to become a net-zero carbon economy by 2050. Scaling up renewable energy generation has catapulted Britain through a decade of electrical system change, but to capitalise on this momentum in the 2020s, low-carbon energy must be complemented with low-carbon flexibility. That must mean the growth of industries focused on energy storage, demand reduction and management, and local control systems, ensuring the system can continue to meet demand at all times. After a promising decade of decarbonisation - despite policy setbacks like the green deal – the race is on to be the first G7 country to attain a net-zero carbon economy. Showing that it is possible to fully decarbonise a large economy while remaining internationally competitive would send an important message to the world.

“The problem isn’t that Johnny can’t read. The problem isn’t even that Johnny can’t think. The problem is that Johnny doesn’t know what thinking is; he confuses it with feeling”   
  
Thomas Sowell.



For all the high-minded talk of teaching “critical thinking” and “creativity”, the modern Australian education system notably fails to do either. Nor is “modern educayshun” much chop at teaching kids to even read, write and do maths.



Instead, all that an education system long ago subjugated by the Long March left **really** does is churn out a conga-line of indoctrinated parrots, ruffling their rainbow plumage and shrieking “How dare you!” in chorused rage.



Since Australian schools embraced **Al Gore** ’s doomsday video ‘An Inconvenient Truth’ over 13 years ago the prevailing ideology has been one of climate alarmism.



The hard left Australian Education Union makes no bones about its views when arguing climate change is an “existential threat” and a “catastrophe” and that students must be allowed to wag school in support of the School Strike 4 Climate campaigns[…] **Manuela Mendonca** , the head of Education International (of which the AEU is a member), argued at a recent United Nation’s conference on climate change that the world is facing a “climate emergency” that is threatening “the very existence of humanity”.



That neither statement is even remotely supported by even the IPCC’s own reports is irrelevant. Facts are kryptonite to a left addicted to feelings-as-facts. Instead, these lunatic ideologues demand that their millenarian fantasies pervade every aspect of education.



Mendonca argues teachers must use the classroom to “teach about climate change, its causes, consequences and solutions to the crisis” by ensuring “climate change education is a core element of the curriculum, right from early childhood to university”[…]Teachers are called on to be “change agents” at the “forefront of the fight against climate change”.



 **This isn’t education, it’s indoctrination.** No less than when Soviet schools were indoctrinating children with the cult of Pavlik Morozov, the semi-mythical child snitch, or the Nazis were brainwashing the _Hitlerjugend_.



Heresy is strictly _verboten_.



The international teachers’ guide bemoans the fact that “sometimes science teachers are even encouraged to allow students to debate the causes of climate change, fostering climate denial”.



And it’s not only the issue of climate change and the role of carbon where schools are being pressured to ignore contrarian views and only teach what is mandated as politically correct. The Marxist inspired gender and sexuality Safe Schools program refuses to include any material that might be construed as heteronormative or transphobic.



The rot in education goes all the way to the top. If schools are churning out dumb, thin-skinned dogmatists, it’s because they’re being made increasingly in their teachers’ image.



As students returned to school over the past few weeks, a new crop of graduate teachers was well-equipped to talk to them about the politics of diversity and the deconstruction of traditional education. Sociology, diversity in education and debates over education funding have taken precedence over the teaching of literacy, numeracy and basic classroom management skills for new teachers.



At UTS, cultural competence is the chief goal of Beyond Culture: Diversity in Context. The subject analyses different features of culture like multiculturalism, indigeneity and disability which it claims are vital to the practice of teaching.



And so it goes. In universities across Australia, prospective teachers are being trained to be hypervigilant about “sexuality, ethics, citizenship and social sustainability” at the same time as many of them are unable to [pass basic high school maths and English tests](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/trainee-teachers-failing-basic-maths-and-english-tests-308956.html). This problem is repeated around the English-speaking world.



The only thing that has changed is Australian universities and the decision to minimise the importance of teaching methods that work. This has reduced the quality of teaching degrees and with it the quality of teachers themselves.



 **This is not just a disaster for students, it’s a disaster for teachers, too.** Not all teachers and prospective teachers are brain-dead apparatchiks. The problem is that, like their students, the teachers who dare think for themselves are forced into silence by the knowledge that heresy is career suicide. Bright, dedicated young people who aspire to teaching for teaching’s sake are frustrated and disillusioned by a training system dominated by rigid, stifling leftist orthodoxy.



 **Not that the left-elite care. They don’t need no education – they’ve got thought control.**

Guest Opinion: Dr. Tim Ball

They are physically cleaning up after the “Blizzard of 2016” in the northeastern US. The job is not as onerous as anticipated and is going slowly because the government is in charge. However, it is time for an intellectual clean-up because of what went on. The entire sequence of events is a classic example of environmental and climatic exploitation that parallels the anthropogenic global warming (AGW) deception. [That same sequence] shows what is wrong with weather and climate forecasts, and how it is all amplified and perpetuated by people who don’t know what they are talking about, or, worse, want to know.
The underlying objective was to hype the potential for catastrophe against a backdrop of implications that the event is unnatural. The actors on the stage were the weather office bureaucrats at National Weather Service (NWS) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) who are key players in the global climate deception that is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Mainstream media TV meteorologists were seeking sensationalism under the guise of warning and protecting the people and supported them as usual. Regular mainstream media ambulance-chasing reporters, looking for extremes and creating them when necessary followed them on stage. They later produced stories explaining how the storm was evidence of climate change and global warming. They did this as they ignored the physical evidence, reality, the historical context, and the actual mechanisms of climate change.
The Buildup
 
The Slate headline threatened,
“This “Blizzard for the Ages” Headed for the East Coast Is Very Much the Real Deal.”
“Since early Saturday, nearly every single run of every major model has shown the potential for a foot or two of snowfall on a track to hit somewhere between Northern Virginia and Boston. What’s amazing—perhaps even more so than the impressive potential snow totals—is that all the major weather models are already locked in so far in advance. Simply put: There’s definitely a big storm coming, it’s just the details that are still being worked out.”
 
Notice it is ‘definite’ because all the models agree. In another speculative report, the rhetoric and hyperbole all heightened the anticipation.
“Winter storm Jonas is set to affect almost 76 million people as several feet of snow hit the north-east US, causing travel chaos for millions as internal flights are grounded and international flights under threat of cancellation.
The storm is expected to bring heavy snowfall to 15 states, with blizzard warnings, plunging temperatures and coastal flood warnings in place from 22 to 24 January.”
 
As usual, in today’s PR controlled and directed media, they produced slogans including Snow-mageddon and Snow-pocalypse and Snowzilla.
The Basis For the Hype
I am sure many skeptics reading the Slate quote immediately ignored what it said when they read the phrase “every major model.” Once again they are justified as the failed predictions attest. In this case, it is not just a single model failure but all of them. There is one interesting difference from previous failures that may reflect a growing awareness in the weather agencies that a credibility gap is growing. In an article titled “Snowstorms forecasters under fire as ‘historic’ accumulation failed to materialize” the spokesperson for the US National Weather Service said,
 
“My deepest apologies to many key decision-makers and so many members of the public,” wrote Gary Szatkowski, the meteorologist in charge of the organization’s office in Mount Holly, N.J. “You made a lot of tough decisions expecting us to get it right, and we didn’t. Once again, I’m sorry.”
Does he make the same apology for the failed IPCC predictions his agency promotes?
The spokesperson for the Canadian weather office was more defensive in his remarks.
“There is still a lot of complexity and it is still an imperfect science,” said Peter Kimbell, warning preparedness meteorologist at Environment Canada. However, he rejected the notion that forecasters get the weather wrong most of the time. “We actually get it right a lot of the time,” he said. “And it all depends on your perspective of what getting it right is. If we say we’re going to get 15 centimetres of snow and we get 12, is that good or not good?”
 
The claim of a 3-centimeter error is clever because it puts it within a tolerable range, but that is not what happened. Besides his agency doesn’t acknowledge the imperfect science when it makes global warming predictions for the next few decades.
While Philadelphia, New York and New Jersey had braced for 30 to 60 centimetres of snow, they got far less than that. New York City received about 20 centimetres, Philadelphia a mere 2.5 centimetres or so. New Jersey got up to 20 centimetres.
This is not a surprise because New Scientist reported that Tim Palmer, a leading climate modeller at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts in Reading England said:
 
I don’t want to undermine the IPCC, but the forecasts, especially for regional climate change, are immensely uncertain.
What people overlook is that these are the same agencies, the NWS, NOAA, and EC, who are the IPCC. They are the same agencies telling political leaders and the public that the IPCC forecasts are accurate and must form the basis of political action. In the case of the snowstorm forecast, the political leaders are left without options. They believe they must over respond because a failure to prepare is political suicide. The politicians are in no position to challenge their weather bureaucrats, as Maurice Strong knew when he set up the IPCC through the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).
Historical Context
The storm of 2016 was a standard “Nor’easter”. They are so normal that there is a separate entry in Wikipedia. These storms develop as low-pressure systems along the Polar Front, the boundary between the cold polar air and the warmer subtropical air. They begin in the lee of the Rocky Mountains and are often called Alberta or Canadian Clippers. In the interior of the continent, the circulation brings moisture from the Gulf of Mexico to create legendary blizzards. When the Cold Front pushes toward the Atlantic coast, it tends to run parallel to the coast and the low-pressure system circulation means moisture is picked up from the Atlantic Ocean, and the prevailing northeast winds provide both the name “nor’easter” and the heavy snow conditions.
Lack of knowledge of the mechanisms and failure to check the history of such storms didn’t only hamper politicians.
False Attribution To Global Warming.
In a Business Insider article about “The Blizzard of 2016 (aka Winter Storm Jonas)” Tanya Lewis argues, “Massive snowstorms don’t disprove global warming – in fact, quite the opposite.” This statement is wrong for two major reasons.
1. Meteorologically, because the IPCC claim that greater warming will occur in the polar air than the tropical air. If true, this decreases the temperature difference across the Polar Front. The intensity of storms is determined by that temperature difference, known as the Zonal Index.
2. Historically, because there was a much greater storm in 1888 that followed the same path as the storm of 2016. Global temperatures were lower at that time.
 
The details and impact of “The Blizzard of’88” are described in a 1976 publication by the US Depart of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Environmental Data Service written by Patrick Hughes and titled “American Weather Stories” (see image). Here is what one report outlined.
The blizzard cutoff and immobilized Washington, D. C., Philadelphia, New York City, and Boston. Snowfall averaged 40 to 50 inches over southeastern New York State and southern New England, with drifts to 30 and 40 feet. In Middletown New York, snowdrifts were reported to have covered houses three stories high. The townspeople had to tunnel through the snow like miners, even shoring up the passageways with timber. For two days, frequent gale force to near hurricane winds accompanied below freezing temperatures which ranged from near zero to the low 20s over much of the area.
 
Men, women, and children died in city streets, in country fields and on ice-choked ships and boats. Over 400 died, 200 in New York City alone. Thousands more suffer everything from exhaustion to amputation of frostbitten limbs.
 
The great storm buried trains all over the northeast, marooning passengers for days in some cases for a week or more. The blizzard was a marine disaster from Chesapeake Bay through New England. Some 200 vessels were sunk, grounded, or wrecked and abandoned. At least 100 seamen died in the storm they called the Great White Hurricane. Of 40 vessels in Philadelphia’s Harbor, only 13 escaped destruction or disabling damage, and at least 30 crew members perished.
Maximum wind velocities recorded range from 48 mph at New York City to 60 mph at Atlantic City and 70 mph at Block Island.
Ironically, the report notes,
“The Blizzard of ’88 was not the most violent storm to visit the northeast.” 
 
Summary
Michael Crichton identified the overall challenges in analysing the events preceding, during, and following the Blizzard of 2016.
The greatest challenge facing mankind is the challenge of distinguishing reality from fantasy, truth from propaganda. Perceiving the truth has always been a challenge to mankind, but in the information age (or as I think of it, the disinformation age) it takes on a special urgency and importance.
 
As a finale and evidence of unwillingness to face facts the NWS claim
‘This storm ranks up there with the great blizzards of the past 100 years in terms of amount of snowfall, size of impacted areas and population affected,’
A very unhelpful, unscientific, statement that reveals the political hyperbole that drives the story. Not to be outdone NOAA report,
Last weekend’s historic blizzard has been revealed as the fourth most largest snowstorm ever to hit the Northeast, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
It is nice to learn that NOAA has records covering the entire multi-billion-year history of the region as the word “ever” indicates. Maybe they could use these to put their claims about the record warm in 2015 in perspective.
The Blizzard is a classic example of how those with a political agenda took a normal, natural, event and turned it into a potential catastrophe. They gave their claims legitimacy with computer models. The compliant sensation-seeking media repeated and amplified the story until politicians were left with no choice but to overreact. In fact, this is a self-inflicted wound because the politicians lead people to expect the government to look after them.
The final fiasco is that disciples of the false story about human-caused global warming saw an opportunity to further their agenda. They ignore the fact that the models were wrong about the blizzard and make claims that are scientifically inaccurate. Of course, they will never give up as long as they ignore reality and their jobs and careers are dependent on maintaining the deception. The storm of 2016 shows how the deceptions are occurring at the local and global scale.
===============================
UPDATE:
Some have raised issues with parts of my article It Is Time For A Complete Cleanup After “The Blizzard Of 2016.” At Anthony’s suggestion I provide the following responses.

In the article I mistakenly connected comments about a failed forecast from the 2015 storm with the 2016 storm. I should have identified that the comments applied to the 2015 report. For that I apologize. However, in my opinion they are also applicable to the hyperbole and sensationalism that preceded and followed the 2016 event.

They are certainly applicable to my larger point that these are the same people, both government bureaucrats and mainstream media  weather and news reporters, who tell us they are certain about the climate forecasts based on models of the IPCC. That duplicity is unacceptable.

Despite Werme’s claims the accuracy of the forecast for 2016 was not that good; wind speeds and snowfall levels did not reach what were predicted. As he acknowledged  “Ultimately, the NAM was the first model to get it right, but suffered some ridicule from the human mets before the rest of the models came around and reality proved the NAM was right.”

Yes, “ultimately” the NAM (North American Mesoscale) model got it right, https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/model-data/model-datasets/north-american-mesoscale-forecast-system-nam but by then the sensationalism was in full flight.


http://www.kabc.com/2016/01/21/massive-snowstorm-set-to-break-records/


The important point is the frustration for official forecasters that there is a difference between what the official agencies produce and what is presented by the mainstream TV weather people. Unfortunately for them it is where the hype that pushes the demand for politicians to react is generated. I have less and less sympathy with them as they, particularly NOAA and NASA, exploit the media with their press releases.

The final snowfall totals for every State are given here.


http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/winter_storm_summaries/storm1/stormsum_13.html

There was also the problem of accuracy triggered by this report about Washington measurements.


http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2016/01/25/us/politics/ap-us-big-snowstorm-inaccurate-snow-count.html?_r=0
The Washington Post reported that airport weather observers lost their snow-measuring device in the blizzard. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration spokeswoman Susan Buchanan would say only that “questions were raised about the reading.”
As a result, she said the National Weather Service would assemble an internal review team to assess how snow measurements are taken at Reagan National and other locations.

Notice that this involves a review of snow measurement methodologies. Precipitation is a very difficult thing to measure accurately because it is so variable within very short distances and greatly affected by wind and other factors. Anthony Watts showed the inaccuracy of temperature measurements in his weather station project http://www.surfacestations.org/. It is time to do another project on the inaccuracy of the other variables because all the factors that affect the temperature data also apply to them.  As Anthony knows the normal practice is to melt the snow and use water amount as a snowfall equivalent, but that reflects that the water content varies from snowfall to snowfall.

The records for the 2016 event are not exceptional, especially when compared to long term records. Here is an article that tries to hype the actual results.


http://mashable.com/2016/01/24/2016-blizzard-records/#mrgAwaOV1uqK

It is a masterpiece of squeezing something out of virtually nothing. Notice that it does not mention anything outside of the modern record,  in other words, it only applies to  events within the last 100-years.

I then compared the 2016 storm with a much larger event in 1888. All of that still applies. For example, compare the loss of life in New York City alone. There are 19 deaths (mostly in car accidents) in the entire NE US region attributed to the 2016 event.


http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/23/winter-storm-east-coast-snow-blizzard-new-york-baltimore-washington-philadelphia

Compare this with the 400 deaths over the region attributed to the 1888 event and 200 deaths in New York City. To put this in even better perspective, compare the percentage of the populations. In 1888 the population was 1,206,299, in 2014 it was 10,406,785.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_New_York_City

There are claims that my reference to Alberta Clippers is incorrect. I respectfully disagree. This is another issue that has challenged weather and climate research all along. What triggers development of depressions along the Polar Front that sometimes develop into mid-latitude cyclones like the 2016 storm. H.H Lamb spent years studying this issue, particularly with regard to their track and impact across the Atlantic on Britain and western Europe. Marcel Leroux followed the same path with his work on Mobile Polar Highs. I did a lot of work while studying the pattern of precipitation across the Canadian Prairies.

One factor generally considered as the trigger for the development of the depression is the downwind effect of The Rocky Mountains on the circumpolar vortex. This can occur anywhere on the lee side of the mountains, but is particularly favourable in Alberta where the mountains are much higher. This is also why the Chinook effect is so dramatic in that Province.

As this clip explains on certain favourable occasions the mid-latitude cyclones become ‘nor’easters’ along the east coast of the United States.


https://weather.com/storms/winter/video/what-is-an-alberta-clipper

The reality is that neither weather nor climate forecasting are good enough for prime time. Climate forecasts are definitely not good enough as the basis of public policy such as advocated in COP 21 Climate conference in Paris. Weather forecasts are very poor and further complicated by the sensationalism applied to them by the mainstream media. Both circumstances put pressure on politicians to act without regard to the reality of knowledge about weather and climate. Then there are people who don’t understand at all  and incorrectly blend the weather and climate forecasts to support the political AGW agenda.

And so, as I did in the article, I will end with the quote from Michael Crichton


The greatest challenge facing mankind is the challenge of distinguishing reality from fantasy, truth from propaganda. Perceiving the truth has always been a challenge to mankind, but in the information age (or as I think of it, the disinformation age) it takes on a special urgency and importance.

Guest essay by Jim Steele
Director emeritus Sierra Nevada Field Campus, San Francisco State University
For 25 years I’ve lived in the beautiful town of Pacifica, California situated about 15 miles south of San Francisco. It was a wonderful place to raise a family. Its great expanse of green space is a delight for an ecologist. My daily hikes vary from coastal bluffs to watch feeding Humpback Whales or migrating Gray Whales, to inland mountain trails with abundant deer, coyotes and bobcats. Oddly this past week I received emails from friends around the country asking if I was “all right”, thinking my little slice of heaven was falling into the sea. Not to disrespect their concern, I had to belly laugh. The news of a few houses, foolishly built on fragile land too near the sea bluffs’ edge, were indeed falling into the ocean and were now providing great photo-ops for news outlets around the world. See a video here. It is fascinating how such an isolated event covering 0.5% of the town of Pacifica would suggest to friends that the whole town was endangered.
But it was more bizarre that this dot on the map could be extrapolated into an icon of CO2 climate change. I could only laugh as ridiculous CO2 alarmists who metamorphosed a local disaster, brought about by ignorance of natural coastal changes, into a global warming “crystal ball”. NBC news reported the Pacifica event as “a brief window into what the future holds as sea levels rise from global warming, a sort of a crystal ball for climate change.” The SF Chronicle suggested “increased global warming and rising sea levels due to climate change would double the frequency of those severe weather events across the Pacific basin.” The result would be “more occurrences of devastating weather events and more frequent swings of opposite extremes from one year to the next, with profound socio-economic consequences.”

Such apocryphal stories fueled a menagerie of bizarre blogging alarmists. I was recently interviewed by James Corbett, which incurred the wrath of a few internet snipers trying to denigrate my scientific background. Not knowing I also live in Pacifica, bd6951, a skeptic‑bashing poster, linked to a video of threatened apartments in Pacifica and commented, “What we are observing is run away climate change/planetary warming. This is just a guess but, the architecture of these apartment buildings suggest they are at least 20 years old. That means the people who built these units had determined the site was suitable for construction. They clearly were not thinking that an increasingly warming Pacific Ocean would cause their buildings to crash into the ocean 50 or more feet below. Oops. So I want to hear how the climate change denier crowd is going to explain this phenomenon.”
But like so many other alarmists, bd6951 blindly believes every unusual event must be due to rising CO2. Because the media rarely tries to educate the public about natural changes, paranoids like bd6951 perceive every weather event as supporting evidence for their doomsday beliefs, despite a mountain of evidence that it is all natural. Sadly when you try to educate them about documented natural change, paranoids feel you are “disarming them and exposing them to even greater dangers of rising CO2. But anyone familiar with Pacifica’s history understands this coastal erosion hotspot has nothing to do with global warming, and everything to do with the local geology and the natural El Nino oscillation.
So let’s put California’s eroding coastline into both a long term and recent framework. About 72% of California’s coastline consists of steep mountains slopes or raised marine terraces that are being relentlessly chipped away by Pacific Ocean waves. However the geology of the coast is complex due to varied depositional events, colliding plate tectonics and earthquake faults. At one extreme are erosion-resistant metamorphosed submarine basalts, greenstones, formed over 100 million years ago during the age of dinosaurs, and often forming headlands that defy the battering waves. Similarly the granites of the Monterrey Peninsula endure with very little erosion. On the other extreme are unconsolidated sandstones that were deposited during the past 12,000 years of the Holocene. Due to vastly different resistances to erosion, California’s presents a majestically steep and undulating coastline. The Pacifica locale has eroded more rapidly because the sea cliffs consist mostly of weakly or moderately cemented marine sediments from the more recent Pleistocene and Holocene. And because Pacifica has long been known as a hot spot of coastal erosion, it has been studied for over 100 years. For a more detailed geology read a 2007 USGS report Processes of coastal bluff erosion in weakly lithified sands, Pacifica, California, USA . As always, before we can blame catastrophic CO2 climate change, we must understand the local setting and the effects of natural change.

Since the end of the Last Glacial Maximum sea levels have risen about 120 meters. During the past 18,000 years most of California’s coast retreated 10 to 20 kilometers eastward at rates of 50 to 150 centimeters per year. The San Francisco/Pacifica region was much more susceptible to erosion and retreated about 50 km. After the Holocene Optimum ended about 5,000 years ago and sea level rise slowed, and California’s current rate of coastal erosion decreased to about 10 to 30 cm/year. Undoubtedly rising sea levels have driven coastal erosion. But based on San Francisco Bay Area’s sea level change posted at the PSMSL, since the end of the Little Ice Age this region has undergone a steady rise in sea level of less about 2 mm/year and counter-intuitively, the rate of sea level rise has slowed the past few decades as seen in the graph. Sea level rise varies most between El Nino and La Nina events.
Assuming a 150-year rate of local coastal erosion of 30 cm/year, any structure built within 20 meters of the sea bluffs’ edge in 1950, was doomed to fall into the ocean by 2015. But homebuyers that were new to the region were typically naïve about the natural geology and climate. Fortunately when I was shopping for Pacifica homes in 1982, my background allowed me to recognize that developers had ignored all the signs of natural climate change. They unwisely built homes too near the cliffs’ edge to ensure a spectacular view, or they had built in the flood plains and filled tidal marshes. Awareness of the power of El Niño’s is critical. Sea cliffs crumble and flood plains flood during El Nino events. Indeed during the 1982 El Nino, Pacifica’s Linda Mar lowlands flooded as heavy precipitation filled the banks of San Pedro Creek and high tides resisted the creek’s flow to the ocean. Inspecting Linda Mar’s homes, we could still smell the dampness in every house located in those lowlands. Along the bluffs of Esplanade Drive we likewise saw a evidence of coastal retreat during the 1982 El Nino, but not enough to undermine homes and apartments. That did not happen until the El Nino of 1997/98. Wisely we bought our home further inland on a solid ridge. As seen in the picture below from a USGS report, homes in the Esplanade area still had backyards until the 1997/98 El Nino struck. Residents were well aware of the imminent threat as revealed by the boulders, or riprap, placed at the base of the crumbling cliffs to discourage erosion, but those remedies were no match for the ensuing El Nino storm surge.
Unfortunately scientific measurements of coastal erosion did not begin until the 1960s led by Scripps Institute of Oceanography. So early developers had to guess how far back to set their homes from the bluffs’ edge. Due to recent research we now know that those cliffs had “retreated episodically at an average rate of 0.5 to 0.6 meter (1.5 to 2 feet) per year over the past 146 years.” But lacking geologic backgrounds and unaware of natural weather cycles, developers’ ability to estimate a “safe distance” was hampered by the episodic nature of coastal erosion that could lull people into believing erosion was minimal.
Minimal erosion may happen for decades when La Ninas divert the storm tracks northward, during which time naïve homebuyers and builders are not alerted to inevitable future threats. Those mild periods are soon followed by rapid losses during El Nino events. Thus ill informed in 1949, developers constructed several homes at the top of a 20-meter sea cliff along Esplanade Drive in the city of Pacifica. During the heavy winter storms of the 1997/1998 El Niño, 10 meters of local coastline were rapidly eroded, eliminating the last vestiges of the backyards that had survived the 1982 El Nino (see pre-1997 photograph below). In 1997/98, seven homes were undermined and three others threatened. All ten homes were eventually condemned and demolished.

Nonetheless early developers should have been more cautious and alerted by past catastrophes. Early entrepreneurs in California were eager to develop its vast potential. The Ocean Shore Railroad was built, hoping to link San Francisco to Santa Cruz and entice more immigration into the area, as well as to transport lumber and agricultural products. Where the terrain was too daunting to go up and over, they chiseled out ledges that circumscribed the coastal cliffs. Scheduled to open in 1907, the 1906 San Francisco earthquake disrupted those plans. Pacifica lies just south of the San Andreas Fault, and its movement dropped a length of 4000+ feet of right-of-way along Pacifica’s fragile sea cliffs into the sea along with all their railroad building equipment. The surviving railroad ledges can still be seen today.
If you spend enough time walking along Pacifica’s beaches, you would recognize an annual pattern of beach erosion. Heavy winter storms carry the smaller grains of sand offshore restructuring a sandy beach into a bed of rocky cobble. The gentler waves during the summer return the sands to the beach and bury the cobble. The currents will also carry some displaced sand down the coast, while those same currents also carry sands from further upstream. When not enough sand is delivered to replenish a beach, it undergoes rapid erosion. So in addition to natural changes, the damming of rivers that halt the seaward supply of sediments can starve a beach and promote erosion. Likewise when naturally eroding cliffs are armored at their base by boulders, the lack of local erosion can starve adjacent beaches of needed replenishing sediments. Because of that possible impact on neighbors, the California Coastal Commission now requires a permitting process before any seawall can be built. Finally jetties that are built to protect harbors often block the transport sand along the coast, starving beaches down stream from the jetty and causing amplified erosion. In many locations, governments dredge regions of sediment build-up, and dump those sediments where beaches are now starving, such as being done by San Francisco just north of Pacifica.
This region’s coastal erosion is episodic for well-understood reasons. When a cliff face collapses it leaves a pile of rubble at the cliff’s base, sometimes called the “toe”, which raises the beach and acts to naturally buffer the cliff face from further erosion. After several years, waves and currents carry the buffering toe away, and eventually exposes the cliff to another “bite” from the ocean.
Furthermore the Pacific Decadal Oscillation is expressed as a 20 to 30 year negative phase with more frequent La Nina’s alternating with a positive phase with more frequent El Nino’s. The relatively stationary high-pressure systems prominent during La Nina’s, forces storm tracks to the north of California. Fewer storms mean less coastal erosion, but also result in more California droughts. The current return of El Nino now allows storm tracks to attack the California coast. Snow is currently above average in the Sierra Nevada and reservoirs are filling, but simultaneously coastlines are more heavily eroded.
In addition, the effect of higher rates of precipitation associated with El Nino also cause greater slippage between geologic layers that differ in their ability to handle subsurface water flows. Heavier precipitation caused episodic collapses of coastal Highway 1 at Devil’s Side at the south end of Pacifica. A tunnel was just built to re-route the highway away from that geologically unstable area.
For millennia El Nino cycles have caused these natural extreme swings that alternate between droughts and floods and episodic coastal erosion. Changing your carbon footprint will never stop the process. But knowledge of these natural processes will keep people out of harms way. One of the greatest sins of the politics of the climate wars is that people are not being educated about natural climate change. They are not being taught how to be wary of natural danger zones. Instead every flood and every drought, every heat wave or snowstorm is now being hyped as a function of global warming. After every catastrophic natural weather event, yellow journalists like the Washington Post’s Chris Mooney or APs Seth Bornstein, seek out CO2 alarmist scientists like Kevin Trenberth or Michael Mann, to make totally unsubstantiated pronouncements that the event was 50% or so due to global warming. After centuries of scientific progress, Trenberth and his ilk have devolved climate science to the pre-Copernican days so that humans are once again at the center of the universe, and our carbon sins are responsible for every problem caused by an ever-changing natural world.
You can recognize those misleading journalists and scientists who are either totally ignorant of natural climate change, or who are politically wedded to a belief in catastrophic CO2 warming, when they falsely argue, as NBC news did, that “frequent swings of opposite extremes” are due to global warming. El Nino’s naturally bring these extremes every 3 to 7 years, as well as the 20 to 30 years swings of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. These swings have occurred for centuries and millennia! The same storms that bring much needed rains will also batter the coast and increase episodic erosion. But by ignoring natural change, climate fear mongers delude the public into believing La Nina-caused droughts of the past few years were due to CO2 warming. And now as El Nino returns the rains to California, those same climate fear mongers want us to believe CO2 warming is causing an abrupt swing to heavy rains and coastal erosion. One needs only look at the historical records to find Pacifica’s coastal erosion was much greater around the 1900’s, and that El Ninos have caused natural extreme swings for millennia.
Honest science, useful science, must educate people about our natural hazards and natural climate oscillations; so that people do not build too close to fragile cliff edges or build in the middle of a flood plain. It is not just the coast of California that is eroding. The politicization of climate change is eroding the very integrity of environmental sciences. Reducing your carbon footprint will never save foolishly placed buildings in Pacifica or stop the extreme swings in weather induced by El Nino’s and La Nina’s. It was the end of the Ice Age that initiated dramatic coastal erosion and only a return to those frozen years will stop it. Pacifica’ eroding bluffs are simply evidence that most of California has still not reached an equilibrium with the changes that began 18,000 years ago. Pacifica is truly an icon of natural climate change. 
But the ranks of climate alarmists are filled with legions of scientific ignoranti who blindly see such coastal erosion as another “proof” of impending CO2-caused climate hell. This group lusts for climate catastrophes to prove they are not blindly paranoid. Other self-loathing CO2 alarmists simply lust for climate catastrophes that will deal humans their final “come-uppance.” So they too lust for climate catastrophes. Only a solid of understanding of natural climate change can prevent this climate insanity and pave the way to truly scientifically based adaptive measures.

"BEIJING  —   For China, President Trump’s scrapping of the   Pacific trade agreement is a chance to extend Beijing’s economic and political influence. And it is an opportunity to deepen ties with its neighbors in Asia. But with a cooling economy at home and a looming leadership   the last thing President Xi Jinping wants is a trade war, though officials are girding for that possibility. Rather, China’s leaders crave stability and predictability. Early signs indicate they may not get their wish. The Chinese fear that if Mr. Trump was willing to toss aside years of delicate negotiations with allies and decades of American trade policy, he could also go his own way on issues he has staked out with Beijing, including Taiwan and the South China Sea. As if to bolster that point, on Monday  —   the same day that Mr. Trump withdrew from the   Partnership, the   trade agreement  —   his spokesman said the United States would prevent China from accessing islands it claims in the South China Sea, a threat that one nationalist Chinese newspaper had already warned would mean war. “This shows that Trump might act on his words,” Deng Yuwen, a public affairs commentator in Beijing, said in an interview. “With previous presidents, their election promises weren’t taken so seriously. ” He added, “That means China must take his other warnings more seriously, especially about the South China Sea and Taiwan. ” Mr. Trump’s goal in squelching the trade agreement was to protect American jobs and businesses. His trade officials have argued that the deal does not do enough to help the United States or to contain China, which was not invited to join the agreement. But in killing an agreement designed to limit China’s vast economic reach in Asia and anchor America’s presence in the world’s fastest growing region, analysts said, Mr. Trump created a void that President Xi was already practicing to fill. Only last week, Mr. Xi was trying on the mantle of global leadership at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, suggesting that with the United States in retreat, China was prepared to step up as a champion of free trade and protector of the global environment. Mr. Xi has kept China’s economy behind high walls, and China remains the world’s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, but inconsistencies have never ruffled the president. “This is indeed a big win for China in the struggle for global leadership,” said Zhang Baohui, director of the center for Asia Pacific studies at Lingnan University in Hong Kong. “Trump is surrendering this opportunity to prove the continuing relevance of American primacy. ” The death of the trade agreement is likely to accelerate Beijing’s push for its alternative trade agreement, the   Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. That agreement would exclude the United States and would reduce or eliminate tariffs on trade among China, Southeast Asian nations, Australia, India, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand. It includes few of the features of T. P. P. that would have been most awkward for Beijing, such as protections for independent labor unions and the environment, and requirements that   enterprises behave more like commercial enterprises. The agreement has stalled on rifts between Southeast Asian nations and the others, but Thailand’s minister of commerce, Apiradi Tantraporn, said Monday that the talks “are expected to be expedited” without the T. P. P. But the end of the T. P. P. will not be Mr. Trump’s last word on trade with China. His trade officials say they expect greater access to the Chinese market in exchange for the easy access Chinese goods have to the United States. And they appear prepared to risk a trade war, an expanding    contest of tariffs and other trade restrictions, to get it. Mr. Trump’s trade officials have threatened to impose high tariffs on Chinese goods, starting with heavily subsidized products such as steel and aluminum, imported into the United States. “It’s a little weird that we have very low tariffs and China has very high tariffs,” Wilbur Ross, the nominee for commerce secretary, said at his Senate confirmation hearing last week. Last week, China proposed allowing greater foreign investment in certain sectors, but there was little confidence the recommendations would be carried out in the foreseeable future, and American businesses said they felt less welcome in China than before. While Mr. Trump’s advisers say that China has more to lose than the United States in a trade war, Chinese officials told visiting American businessmen last week that Beijing was prepared. They had developed lists of punitive options they would take against the United States if Washington took the initiative, they said. “The signals are very clear: If this is going to be a trade war, China will reduce imports of American aircraft from Boeing and agricultural products,” said Wu Xinbo, director of American studies at Fudan University in Shanghai. “We can turn to Europe, Australia and Canada for those products. And we know that 20 to 30 of the states in the United States with big agricultural lobbies and Boeing plants will be putting pressure on Congress. ” A   American trade expert in China agreed, saying China was prepared to go to the mat. “Trump’s trade team would be wise to shelve ‘The Art of the Deal’ and focus on the ‘Art of War,’ if they really want to know what’s ahead in U. S.  trade relations,” said James Zimmerman, a managing partner of the Beijing office of the law firm Sheppard, Mullin, Richter  Hampton who has worked in China for 19 years. “China views Trump as a paper tiger that will likely back down on the complicated, thorny issues that are not negotiable. The Chinese also know that Trump won’t risk a trade war lest the business community will be up in arms. ” Others, though, detect anxiety, and read China’s outward confidence as bluster. Bilahari Kausikan, ambassador at large for Singapore, said China had “a real insecurity about a trade war. ” Both sides are likely to lose, he said, but China stands to lose more “since the U. S. domestic political order is not at stake in the same way as the Chinese Communist Party rule may be at stake. ” The next few months, as Mr. Xi focuses on choosing new members of the ruling Standing Committee for his second   term, will be a particularly tense political period, and economic instability is the last thing he needs. Similarly, he will try at all costs to appear strong to his domestic, nationalistic audience in the face of challenges from Mr. Trump on Taiwan and the South China Sea. Mr. Trump has suggested that the One China policy, under which the United States recognizes the government of Beijing and not Taiwan, is not sacrosanct, a major concern for Mr. Xi. “In a year of political transition, Xi cannot afford to come across as weak,” said Paul Haenle, the director of the   Center for Global Policy in Beijing, who served as China director for the National Security Council under President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama. “Taiwan is the core of core issues for China  —   a bottom line. Many Chinese stress that it is nonnegotiable. ” But for now, at least, the increased contention with Washington is likely to strengthen Mr. Xi’s political hand at home by rallying public and elite support against a foreign threat, said Minxin Pei, a professor at Claremont McKenna College in California who studies Chinese politics and   relations. “Short term, it will almost certainly give the Chinese government a boost in its public support,” Dr. Pei said in a telephone interview. “It helps Xi, because whenever there is such pressure from outside, Chinese officials tend to rally around the top leader. ” Mr. Trump has also threatened China on control of territory it claims in the South China Sea. The comments by Mr. Trump’s press secretary, Sean Spicer, on Monday echoed those made by his nominee for secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, at his Senate confirmation hearing. While Mr. Trump has not explained how he will keep China off islands where it has built airstrips and installed weapons, the comments by his appointees suggest the possibility of an American blockade. While Mr. Obama tried unsuccessfully to leverage American allies in the region to compel China to back down, Mr. Trump seems willing to abandon them and face China on his own. That    attitude has raised alarms at the Pentagon and among American Navy experts, who said such a blockade would be tantamount to war. The idea has also alarmed America’s allies. Australia, Washington’s staunchest ally in the Asia Pacific region, would not participate in such a venture, its defense officials said, adding that a blockade could not be successful and could serve to persuade disenchanted American friends in the Asia Pacific to pivot toward China. With Mr. Trump portending divisive action on many fronts, Mr. Xi was calm and prepared, his foreign minister, Wang Yi, suggested. “Serene under the tumultuous clouds,” Mr. Wang said, quoting a line from a poem by Mao Zedong, the founder of Communist China. No one knows how long that will be the case."

Today’s _Washington Post_ story by Darryl Fears on California drought frequency in a warming world compelled me to take a look at the Golden State’s temperature history. In my 2011 book _Climate Coup, _ I showed that the alarm over California warming was rather odd, as most of the changes had taken place thirty years previously.   
  
That was then, and this is now. But what about history?   




Here are California temperatures, for the last 38 years, beginning in 1976. That’s the year of “The Great Pacific Climate Shift,” a sudden and lasting change in both the surface and oceanic circulation patterns. 2014 is by far the warmest year in the California record, as is obvious:   






Several things stand out. There’s obviously no warming through 2011 (when _Climate Coup_ was published). But the pop between 2013 and 2014 is pretty impressive, no?   
  
Fast-backward to 1934. J.B. Kincer had just published the first systematic temperature analysis from locations around the planet, in the 1933 _Monthly Weather Review_ paper titled “Is our Climate Changing?” The paper clearly demonstrated global warming, and people were starting to talk about the influence of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide on surface temperature. The only thing that was different back then is that we didn’t have computers to simulate what should have been happening. But if we did, I suspect that Darryl Fears’ progenitors would have written a pretty similar story.   
  
Why? Take a look at the 38-year period (the same length as in the above figure) 1896-1934:   
  
  




What’s different here? Nothing. Also worth noting is the difference in mean temperature between the two periods, providing very strong evidence for the step-change in California temperature that occurred with the Great Pacific Climate Shift in 1976.   
  
Armed with a computer model in 1935, one could probably have written the exact same story 80 years ago, prompted by the very similar outlier temperatures of 1934 and 2014.

"Under-regulated fishing along the Great Barrier Reef is putting the world’s biggest coral reef system at further risk as it deals with repeated mass bleaching events, the Australia government’s marine park authority has found. Conservationists and recreational fishing groups have told Guardian Australia the Queensland government’s rollout of major fisheries reforms, designed to tackle the issues along the reef, has stalled. Some recreational fishers have walked away from government-run working groups in frustration, saying they will not rejoin until the state government passes new regulations to cap the amounts and types of fish that can be caught. Queensland’s fisheries minister, Mark Furner, said the government remained committed to the reforms and they were still “on track”. The Great Barrier Reef has seen three major outbreaks of coral bleaching in the past five years – events driven by climate heating that can kill and weaken corals and severely disturb the ecosystem. The federal and state governments agree the reef’s greatest threat is from climate change, but there is also broad agreement that local impacts – including improving water quality and tackling unsustainable fishing – could buy the reef more time. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority quietly published its first broad position statement on fishing in late August, laying out a series of issues. The only previous fishing statement, from 2007, covered just one fishery. So-called “incidental catch” of at-risk species – including dolphins, whales, dugongs, saw fish, sea snakes, turtles and some shark – was “the most significant fisheries sustainability issue” in the marine park, the authority said. The use of large nets in one fishery put marine wildlife at risk from entanglements and death. While there was some regulation, over-fishing was causing significant declines of saucer scallop, east coast Australian snapper, pearl perch, black jewfish and some shark species. “Over-fishing and illegal fishing can compromise the long-term sustainability of stocks and impact the resilience of the marine ecosystem,” the reef marine park authority’s statement says. An authority spokesperson said statements were used to lay out its position “on an issue where it has strong interest, but is outside its direct regulatory control”.  The authority has zones in the marine park that tell recreational and commercial fishers what they can do and where. But the Queensland government is responsible for regulating fishing. The state government’s 10-year sustainable fisheries strategy up to the year 2027 would help address the threats if it were fully implemented, the statement said. But the Australian Marine Conservation Society, WWF Australia and some recreational fishing groups told Guardian Australia that progress on the strategy had ground to a halt. John Bennett, president of the Mackay Recreational Fishers Alliance, said: “I’m worried that if this [strategy] doesn’t go ahead, then the future looks more like the past.” Bennett is one of seven recreational fishers who wrote a letter to the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, in late May to say they were standing down from working groups set up to deliver the reforms. In the letter, seen by Guardian Australia, the group wrote that the strategy’s implementation had stalled at the political level and this was “a betrayal of the good faith we placed in you and your elected colleagues”. Bennett said reforms were passed in September 2019 setting restrictions on the recreational catch of several species, but promised rules on the commercial sector had not followed. Fishers can be out there catching endangered wildlife and the authority has no idea what’s being caught In 2019, a five-yearly report on the health of the reef downgraded its long-term outlook to “very poor”, with climate change recognised as the reef’s greatest threat. Tooni Mahto, a fisheries and threatened species campaigner at the marine conservation society, said the reforms had been urgent for a decade. There was excitement among stakeholders when the Palaszczuk government committed to the fisheries reforms, she said, but they had “hit a brick wall”, with no significant steps since September 2019. “We can’t wait any longer and the reef can’t wait any longer.” Mahto said regulations waiting to be tabled to parliament included rules to force commercial fishers to land sharks whole instead of dividing them up at sea. Without reform, fisheries managers were in the dark about which sharks were being caught, and how many. Also waiting, she said, were new rules that would divide fishing areas into smaller and more manageable zones, set catch limits and put monitoring cameras on boats to confirm when fishers had caught endangered species such as dugongs and turtles. “Fishers can be out there catching endangered wildlife and the authority has no idea what’s being caught,” she said. There was one more sitting week left before the Queensland government entered caretaker mode ahead of the 31 October election and that time needed to be used to push regulations through, Mahto said. Simon Miller, who works on sustainable fisheries at WWF Australia, said removing the use of large gill nets from the reef was a key issue. The charity asked the government to remove all nets between Cooktown and the Torres Strait to protect a stronghold for dugongs. The fisheries minister said in a statement the government was committed to its reforms “to safeguard fisheries for our children and grandchildren”. A third annual progress report, due to be released earlier this year, was delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic but was expected before the end of the year. That government report charts progress against targets.  The minister said risks to threatened species from nets was a key objective and that proposed management strategies would give more protection.  Urgent management actions had been introduced to rebuild populations of scallops, pearl perch and snapper, which were all depleted. There were plans to review the status of Spanish mackerel. Black jewfish are prized for their swim bladders – considered a delicacy and an aphrodisiac in some Asian markets. The fish was currently a “no take” species “to address concerns about black marketing of this high value fisheries resource”, Furner said.  “The reforms are still under active consideration by the government. A sustainable fishery is critical to supporting jobs in both the commercial and recreational fishing industries.”"

Today is Constitution Day, marking the day in 1787 when the Framers signed the document they’d spent that long hot summer drafting and sent it out to the states for ratification. In a striking change from not that many years ago, this morning’s papers bring us two significant articles about the current debate over the document.   
  
  
In _The New York Times_ , Kate Zernike’s “On Day Devoted to Constitution, a Fight Over It” notes how the Tea Party has made the Constitution sexy again, but how doing so has become occasion for battle. Progressive groups, she writes, “accusing the Tea Party of selectively reading the founding document, have responded with a campaign to ‘take back the Constitution’”—the very cry we’ve heard from the Tea Party since its inception three years ago.   
  
  
Meanwhile, in this morning’s _Washington Post_ , David A. Fahrenthold’s “Congress finds, and lists, meaning in Constitution” focuses on the pledge House Republicans took last January to cite the constitutional authority for any measure they introduced and on how that pledge has played out since then. Not surprisingly, it’s a mixed record, as he details.   
  
  
But the larger lesson to be drawn from both articles should not be missed. We are again talking about the Constitution. And as Zernike writes, “In one respect, the Tea Party has already won. When groups on the left talk about the Constitution, they are increasingly emphasizing the original text — as the originalists do — rather than the Supreme Court decisions that have upheld programs like Social Security.” That is a distinction we at Cato’s Center for Constitutional Studies have long drawn, namely, that there’s all the difference in the world between modern “constitutional law”—the post‐​New Deal Supreme Court decisions we live under today—and the Constitution itself.   
  
  
And we’ll take credit too for helping to bring this debate back to life, because when the Center was created 22 years ago, we took it as central to our mission to revive that debate—in particular, to help change the climate of ideas to one more conducive to reviving the Framers’ Constitution of liberty through limited government. Toward that end, two days ago we held our tenth annual Constitution Day conference, releasing there our tenth annual _Cato Supreme Court Review_.   
  
  
Read this morning’s articles. Then go here for answers to many of the questions they raise.

"**Huge numbers of protesters have marched through the streets of Hong Kong in the largest anti-government rally in months.**
For the first time since August, police allowed a rally by the Civil Human Rights Front, a pro-democracy group.
Organisers said an estimated 800,000 took part while police put the number at 183,000.
Police said 11 people were arrested in raids ahead of the rally and that a handgun was seized.
The protests started in June over a controversial extradition bill, and have now evolved into broader anti-government demonstrations.
""I will fight for freedom until I die,"" said June, a 40-year-old mother in Victoria Park, where protesters gathered.
In a statement on Saturday, the government called for calm and said it had ""learned its lesson and will humbly listen to and accept criticism"".
At the end of the march, the government said it was looking forward to finding ""a way out for Hong Kong's deep problems through dialogue"".
Monday will mark six months since a mass rally on 9 June that triggered the political crisis that has gripped the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.
Organisers of the rally, the Civil Human Rights Front, said this was the government's last chance to meet their demands, which include an independent inquiry into the police's handling of the protests, an amnesty for those arrested, and free elections.
Clashes have become increasingly violent in recent months, raising the question of how the unrest can be stopped.
Around 6,000 people have been arrested and hundreds injured, including police, since June.
Yet, Sunday's march was largely peaceful, with few reports of violence despite tensions running high at times.
As the march neared its end, protesters held their mobile phone torches aloft, illuminating the streets as they chanted anti-government songs.
Meanwhile, the High Court and the Court of Final Appeal were vandalised and attacked with suspected petrol bombs, police said.
The attacks on the courts were widely condemned by march organisers, police and the government, which it said ""undermined Hong Kong's reputation as a city governed by the rule of law"".
Earlier, police said a Glock semi-automatic pistol and 105 bullets were discovered during raids along with a haul of knives and firecrackers. It was said to be the first time that a handgun was found since the protests began.
The city has been relatively calm since pro-democracy candidates won a landslide victory in local council elections two weeks ago.
But discontent with Hong Kong's Chief Executive, Carrie Lam, has not disappeared, with many protesters demanding more concessions from her government.
""No matter how we express our views, through peacefully marching, through civilised elections, the government won't listen,"" one 50-year-old protester, named only as Wong, told AFP news agency.
Hong Kong's protests started in June against plans to allow extradition to mainland China.
Critics feared this could undermine judicial independence and endanger dissidents.
The bill was withdrawn in September but protests continued.
Until 1997, Hong Kong was ruled by Britain as a colony but then returned to China. Under the ""one country, two systems"" arrangement, it has some autonomy, and its people have more rights."

HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (April 29, 2016) — Scientists using long-term surface temperature data to track climate change caused by greenhouse gases would be best served using only daily high temperature readings without the nighttime lows, according to new research at The University of Alabama in Huntsville.
Using temperature data from Alabama going back to 1883, scientists in UAH’s Earth System Science Center developed and tested various methods for creating stable, reliable long-term climate datasets for three portions of inland Alabama.
In addition to creating some arcane mathematical tools useful for creating climate datasets, the team also found daytime high temperature data is less likely to be contaminated by surface issues — such as deforestation, construction, paving and irrigation — than nighttime low temperatures.
“If you change the surface, say if you add buildings or warmer asphalt, you can enhance night time mixing of the lower atmosphere,” said John Christy, the ESSC director and a distinguished professor of atmospheric science at UAH. “That creates a warming caused by vertical mixing rather than changes in greenhouse gases.”
Summer high temperatures are particularly useful in this regard, because summer temperatures tend to be more stable, while cold season temperatures are subject to larger swings due to natural variability. These often wild swings in temperature introduce “noise” into the data, which can mask long-term trends and their causes.
Results of this research were published recently in the American Meteorological Society’s “Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology.”
Basically, under pristine natural conditions, in most places a cool layer of air forms close to the ground after the sun sets. This layer of denser, cooler air creates a boundary layer that keeps out warmer air in the deep layer of the atmosphere above it.
Then people move in. People tend to do all sorts of things that mess with the local climate. Breezes blowing around buildings can cause nighttime turbulence, breaking apart the cool boundary layer. Streets, parking lots and rooftops absorb heat during the day and release it into the atmosphere at night, also causing turbulence. Irrigation increases dry soil’s ability to hold heat and releases a powerful greenhouse gas (water vapor) into the lowest levels of the atmosphere over dry and desert areas.
That’s the short list.
When the cool layer of air near the surface is disturbed, warmer air aloft is drawn down to the surface. All of those cause real changes in the local climate, raising local surface temperatures, especially at night, by amounts large enough to be noticed both by weather station thermometers and by people living in some of those areas.
But none of those changes has anything to do with widespread climate change in the deep atmosphere over large areas of the globe, such as might be seen if caused by increased concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
“Over time this might look like warming or an accumulation of heat in the temperature record, but this temperature change is only caused by the redistribution of warmer air that has always been there, just not at the surface,” said Richard McNider, a distinguished professor of science at UAH.
So how can climatologists use existing long-term surface temperature records to accurately track the potential effects of enhanced CO2? Take the nighttime boundary layer (and all of the things we do to interfere with it) out of play, say Christy and McNider.

“We prefer to take temperature measurements in the deep layer of the atmosphere, which is why we use instruments on satellites,” Christy said. “But the satellite data only goes back to the last few days of 1978. We use the surface record because it is longer, and we really want to look at data that goes back much further than 1978. “Because of the natural mixing of the atmosphere caused by daytime heating, daily maximum temperatures are the best surface data to use to look at temperatures in the deep atmosphere. At the surface, the daytime maximum temperature just represents more air than the nighttime low.”
The new temperature datasets extend the existing climatology for three regions of interior Alabama (around Montgomery, Birmingham and Huntsville) by a dozen summers, all the way back to 1883. Summers in Alabama have been cooling, especially since 1954. Interior Alabama’s ten coolest summers were after 1960, with most of those after 1990. As might be expected given that cooling, climate models individually and in groups do a poor job of modeling the state’s long-term temperature and rainfall changes since 1883.
The researchers conclude the models — the same models widely used to forecast climate change — show “no skill” in explaining long-term changes since 1883.

Abstract


Three time series of average summer [June–August (JJA)] daily maximum temperature (TMax) are developed for three interior regions of Alabama from stations with varying periods of record and unknown inhomogeneities. The time frame is 1883–2014. Inhomogeneities for each station’s time series are determined from pairwise comparisons with no use of station metadata other than location. The time series for the three adjoining regions are constructed separately and are then combined as a whole assuming trends over 132 yr will have little spatial variation either intraregionally or interregionally for these spatial scales. Varying the parameters of the construction methodology creates 333 time series with a central trend value based on the largest group of stations of −0.07°C decade−1with a best-guess estimate of measurement uncertainty from −0.12° to −0.02°C decade−1. This best-guess result is insignificantly different (0.01°C decade−1) from a similar regional calculation using NOAA’s divisional dataset based on daily data from the Global Historical Climatology Network (nClimDiv) beginning in 1895. Summer TMax is a better proxy, when compared with daily minimum temperature and thus daily average temperature, for the deeper tropospheric temperature (where the enhanced greenhouse signal is maximized) as a result of afternoon convective mixing. Thus, TMax more closely represents a critical climate parameter: atmospheric heat content. Comparison between JJA TMax and deep tropospheric temperature anomalies indicates modest agreement (r2 = 0.51) for interior Alabama while agreement for the conterminous United States as given by TMax from the nClimDiv dataset is much better (r2 = 0.86). Seventy-seven CMIP5 climate model runs are examined for Alabama and indicate no skill at replicating long-term temperature and precipitation changes since 1895.

"ASTANA, Kazakhstan  —   Two days of talks over the Syrian civil war concluded on Tuesday with an agreement by Iran, Russia and Turkey to enforce a fragile partial  . But neither the Syrian government nor the rebel fighters  —   who briefly met face to face for the first time in nearly six years of war  —   signed the agreement. While the three powers agreed to establish a mechanism to monitor and enforce the nearly     they did not say what the mechanism should look like, deferring that issue for now. The statement, at least on paper, brought Iran on board with recent new cooperation between Russia and Turkey, and it strengthened Turkey’s commitment to separating rebel groups it supports from jihadist groups. But representatives of the Syrian delegations  —   both from the government and opposition  —   immediately expressed reservations. They emphasized that they had not signed on to a document that had been brokered by the main sponsors of the warring sides in the country, but not by Syrians themselves. Russia is the most powerful backer of the Syrian government, which is also closely allied with Iran, while Turkey has been among the main supporters of rebel groups. Despite the supposed   new clashes were reported in Wadi Barada, a besieged   area and source for most of the drinking water for Damascus, the Syrian capital. Water supplies have been cut off for weeks, and the government and rebel sides have blamed each other. The agreement among Iran, Russia and Turkey was announced a day after the Syrian factions exchanged harsh words at the start of the talks, held in Astana, capital of Kazakhstan. A main result of the meeting was to firm up Russia’s growing role in the Syria diplomacy, establishing the Astana talks as a part of, but not a replacement for, the Geneva process that has been spearheaded for years by the United Nations and the United States. The new document said meetings in Astana, a capital five time zones east of Geneva with close ties to Turkey but firmly within Russia’s sphere of influence, would be a forum to discuss specific issues that come up within the Geneva framework. There had been tentative hopes among some rebel negotiators that Russia might be ready to take on a more active role in seeking a political compromise. But there was no concrete progress on political issues, which were excluded from the narrowly focused talks. Iran, Russia and Turkey affirmed their commitment “to the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of the Syrian Arab Republic as a multiethnic, multireligious, nonsectarian and democratic state,” and their conviction “that there is no military solution to the Syrian conflict and that it can only be solved through a political process. ” Those sentiments echo principles that the United Nations Security Council has laid out. The countries also reiterated “their determination to fight jointly” against the Islamic State and against Al Qaeda’s affiliate in Syria, formerly known as the Nusra Front, pledging to “separate” them from armed opposition groups. That could be an important provision, since the Syrian government led by President Bashar   tends to classify all the opposition fighters indiscriminately as terrorist groups, and many have been unable or unwilling to separate themselves from forces of the former Nusra Front on the battlefield. The agreement did not specify how such a separation might occur, however. In Astana, government representatives said that they still considered the rebel fighters to be terrorists and were waiting to see if Turkey followed through on the agreement. Rebel negotiators said the meetings had given them hope that Russia might be open to hearing rebel concerns and become more willing to press the Syrian government for a political resolution, but such optimism did not extend to Iran, which had stuck to a harder line. Staffan de Mistura, the special United Nations envoy for Syria who had been invited to the Astana talks, said in an interview after the joint statement was issued that in the interactions he had watched between Russia and opposition commanders, “The body language was of people who were seriously talking to each other and taking each other seriously. ” At the same time, rebels are concerned that the new agreement puts Iran in the position of taking part in a   that its own militias have been accused of violating. The next round of talks between the Syrian government and the opposition will occur on Feb. 8 in Geneva, according to the announcement by the three countries. But diplomats in Astana said it was unclear if that date was firm. Bashar   the Syrian ambassador to the United Nations who led his government’s delegation to the talks in Astana, said an offensive by the government and its allied troops would continue, arguing that   “terrorist groups” controlled Ain   a town in Wadi Barada. Residents in Wadi Barada say that some fighters from the former Nusra Front are present there, but that they are at most a tiny minority. Also on Tuesday, United Nations officials appealed for more than $8 billion in funding this year to help millions of people displaced by the Syrian conflict. The United Nations refugee agency is asking for $4. 6 billion to help at least 4. 8 million people who have fled abroad, mainly to Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey, and around $3. 4 billion for an estimated 13. 5 million internally displaced Syrians."
"The chimera of the “danger” of carbon dioxide is absolute nonsense. 
Carbon dioxide is a harmless but essential gas on which all life on earth depends. It is only 385 parts per 1,000,000 of the atmosphere.
An increase to say 5,000 parts per 1,000,000, would do no harm whatsoever to all animal and fish life, but would be of great benefit to plant life.
Any increase over the present content of  atmospheric CO2  enables plants to take greater advantage of photosynthesis and grow quicker using less water.
Who can imagine that Russia, Brazil, China and India are going to burden their economies and their people with the nonsense that both Rudd and Turnbull are proposing?
Who would think that all of the Central and South American nations are going to burden themselves with climate change trading schemes or taxes?
Who would think that any country in all of Africa is going to burden their industries and people with the ridiculous proposals of Rudd and Turnbull?
I have been observing politics and politicians long before most of our politicians were born.
The present crop are the worst we have ever had and need weeding out. They need to be replaced by sensible men and women.

"**Hong Kong's opposition pro-democracy movement has made unprecedented gains in the Chinese territory's district council elections, early results show.**
According to local media counts, 17 of the 18 councils are now controlled by pro-democracy councillors.
Despite fears the vote could be disrupted or cancelled over the unrest, it went ahead peacefully.
The election was seen as a test of support for the government after months of unrest, protests and clashes.
The government and Beijing had been hoping the election would bring a show of support from the so-called ""silent majority"", but that did not materialise. Instead some significant pro-Beijing candidates lost council seats.
One controversial pro-Beijing lawmaker, who lost his seat, Junius Ho, said ""heaven and earth have been turned upside down"".
Hong Kong's district councillors have little political power and mainly deal with local issues such as bus routes and rubbish collection, so the district elections don't normally generate such interest.
But these polls were the first time people could express at the ballot box their opinion on embattled Chief Executive Carrie Lam's handling of the crisis, which was sparked by a now withdrawn extradition law.
Also, 117 of the district councillors will also sit on the 1,200-member committee that votes for the chief executive, so a pro-democracy district win could translate eventually to a bigger share, and say, in who becomes the city's next leader.
A record 4.1 million people had registered to vote - more than half the population - and more than 2.9m people cast votes.
That's a turnout of more than 71%, against 47% in 2015.
The weekend was also the first in months without any clashes between protesters and police.
Over the past months, demonstrations and unrest had been gradually escalating.
Police have at times used live rounds, wounding several protesters. Activists in turn have attacked police or in one case set alight a government supporter.
It was unclear how much of the general population still supported the protesters, and authorities had been hoping the election would identify the protesters as a small group of fringe extremists.
But in many districts, young first-time candidates, many who had explicitly aligned themselves with the protesters, unseated established politicians backing the government.
The hope from activists is that the overwhelming victory of anti-establishment parties will force the government to take protesters' demands more seriously.
**Stephen McDonell, BBC China correspondent, in Hong Kong**
Outside the Yau Ma Tei North polling station, local residents lined up to gain entry so they could watch the vote count. The doors opened and they poured into the public viewing area.
Six months into an ongoing political crisis, people have lost faith in government institutions. They wanted to make sure that this process was fair and transparent.
As they waited for the total in their own district council to be tallied, they could see the numbers coming in from elsewhere on their mobile phones.
By their facial expressions it was clear they couldn't believe what was unfolding, and people cheered in astonishment as one surprising result came in after another.
Nobody imagined such a comprehensive wipeout, and Carrie Lam's administration will no doubt come under renewed pressure to listen to the demands of protestors following such an overwhelming defeat for her and her allies.
More than 1,000 candidates ran for 452 district council seats which, for the first time, were all contested. A further 27 district seats are allocated to representatives of rural districts.
Pro-Beijing parties held the majority of these seats ahead of the election.
In one of the biggest losses for the pro-Beijing camp, lawmaker Junius Ho - one of Hong Kong's most controversial politicians - suffered a shock defeat.
He was stabbed earlier this month by a man pretending to be a supporter. The lawmaker has openly voiced his support for Hong Kong's police force on multiple occasions. He was in July filmed shaking hands with a group of men - suspected of being triad gangsters - who later assaulted pro-democracy protesters.
Jimmy Sham, a political activist who has recently risen to prominence as the leader of the Civil Human Rights Front - a campaign group responsible for organising some of the mass protest marches - won a seat after running for the first time.
Mr Sham has also been attacked twice, once apparently with hammers. Photographs at the time showed him lying on the street covered in blood.
After the vote, Mr Sham said ""we have to be leaders of the community that listens to people's voices and opinions"".
Pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong was barred from running in the elections, a move he referred to as ""political screening"", but the pro-democracy candidate who replaced him has won.
In a tweet, Mr Wong said the ""historic"" results showed that public opinion had not turned against the pro-democracy movement.
Reflecting on her reported defeat, pro-Beijing lawmaker Alice Mak suggested Ms Lam's administration was partly to blame.
""In the election campaign, pro-government candidates have been unfairly treated. This is a very important reason,"" she said.
Starry Lee Wai-king, chairwoman of the city's largest pro-Beijing party, was among the few establishment candidates to secure her seat.
""I think [Lee] is the only one who can survive the de facto referendum,"" said Leung Kwok-hung, her pro-democracy opponent in the poll."

We appear to have entered a new age of unreason… It is from this, above all, that we really need to save the planet. Nigel Lawson
It is widely believed that the carbon emissions of our modern industrial civilization will cause catastrophic global warming. It is called anthropogenic [man-made] global warming (AGW). Media headlines and political chatter have become obsessed with carbon. There is endless talk of carbon emissions, carbon pollution, carbon footprint, carbon offsets, carbon rationing, carbon tax and carbon trading.
We need a new word to encompass all this alarmism about carbon. The word that readily suggests itself is carbophobia. It means “an irrational fear of carbon.”

Global warming is about to heat up and enter the presidential sweepstakes for the year 2000. The fun starts in December, when the United States is going to agree to an amendment to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, also known as the “Rio Treaty,” that requires the signatories to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.



That’s the end of the easy part. Then the administration (read: Vice President Gore) is going to have to sell it to the Senate, which must approve treaties by a two‐​thirds majority. The amendment, which is likely to mandate a reduction of current emissions of between l0 percent and 20 percent by the year 2020; will carry an impressive price tag, perhaps several percent of gross national product per year by the time reductions become serious, according to several economists. It will first go to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, chaired by Jesse Helms, the senior senator from North Carolina. Think it’s going to get out of there alive?



Along the way, Gore is going to have to confront a growing contingent of scientists who are increasingly unhappy with the glib forecasts of gloom and doom. Once dismissed as “a small but vocal band of skeptics,” usually supported by industry, the critics of the global warming thesis now have a rather formidable armada of facts.



As pointed out by Ross Gelbspan in _The Washington Post_ four weeks ago, some of these scientists, myself included, enjoy industry research support. (In my case, 84 percent of my university research is funded by taxpayers.) His figures show an average of 835,000 per year to a few people. The U.S. government spends $2.1 billion per year on global change research and it’s hard to believe so much would be spent on researchers who would say “no problem.” Accepting Gelbspan’s contention that there are 2,000 climate scientists (there are actually about 60 PhDs in climatology in the entire United States), that’s a cool million dollars per scientist, every year. How could the vice president lose the global warming argument with these odds?



Easily. Arguments against highly deleterious global warming have a charm and internal consistency that the arguments of the critics– who emphasize caution and uncertainty– lack. It’s worthwhile to review the way the global warming thesis evolved. In 1990, the first Scientific Assessment of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a document that is the underpinning for the Rio Treaty, stated, “When the latest atmospheric models are run with the present atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, their simulation of climate is generally realistic on large scales.”



Several critics cried foul. The “largest scale” of simulation of planetary climate is surely the average surface temperature, and it was apparent, even back in 1990, that the computer models used to simulate global warming were predicting much more warming than had been observed. Since then, it has become generally accepted that the “generally realistic” models were saying that it should have already warmed between 1.3 degrees and 2.3 degrees Celsius, globally, with the higher figure for the Northern Hemisphere. The observed warning of the earth’s surface temperature since the late 19th century is about one and a half of a degree. The first IPCC assessment is a busted forecast.



Why it took the U.N. five years to realize this is anyone’s guess, but it sure did generate a lot of frequent flier miles for skeptics like me. Finally, in their second Assessment, published in 1995, the IPCC admitted the skeptics had a point: “When increases in greenhouse gases only are taken into account .… most Climate models produce a greater mean warning than has been observed to date, unless a lower climate sensitivity [to the greenhouse effect changes] is used .… There is growing evidence that increases in sulfate aerosols are partially counteracting the [warming] due to increases in greenhouse gases.”



Sulfate aerosols are tiny bits of dust also emitted during the combustion of fossil fuel that cool global warning by reflecting away the sun’s radiation.



Translation of the 1995 report: Either it’s not going to warm up as much as we said it was, or something (like sulfate aerosol) is reducing the warming. I bet that many in my profession will do everything in their power to prove the latter and disparage the former, because no one wants to write the letter, “Dear Mr. Vice President: We are sorry but we goofed. Thanks for the $$. Hope you get your carbon tax. Yours truly, the Consensus of Scientists.”



Thus began a frantic effort to save face. Ben Santer, a fine and aggressive scientist from the Lawrence Livemmore Laboratory, published an article in _Nature_ magazine last year that seemed to show a remarkable correspondence between the evolution of planetary temperature patterns and a model that included both the warming from the greenhouse gases and the cooling from sulfates. This result argued against the skeptics’ proposition that our planet was simply not prone to big‐​time warming. Santer’s study period began in 1962 and ended in 1987.



The critics immediately pointed out that the model he relied on had only half of the known changes in the greenhouse effect. The fact is critics and proponents of the global warming thesis agree that human activities like driving cars and burning coal have changed the amount of warming radiation in the atmosphere only about 2.5 watts (or about one‐​quarter the power of a good flashlight). The central issue is how much this affects the world’s climate.



Santer’s model had attempted to answer that question based on the assumption that the “change” in the amount of warming radiation was only 1.25 watts.



When the right number is put in to Santer’s model, things get even hotter than in the old models that were already abandoned. Worst of all, from Santer’s point of view, when all of the available data, which ran from 1958 through 1995, are used, the correspondence between the model and reality vanishes.



Then there’s the problem of the satellite measured temperatures. These measurements, accurate to .01 degrees Celsius, find a statistically significant cooling trend in the lower atmosphere since they started taking measurements in 1979. The old models, which the U.N. said in 1990 were “generally realistic,” predicted a warming of about .6 degrees Celsius since the satellite measuring started, and even newer models predict warming of .35 degrees of Celsius. This warming simply isn’t happening according to the satellite data.



The satellite data also match up perfectly, on a year‐​to‐​year basis, with temperatures measured in the lower atmosphere by weather balloons. This is a completely independent corroboration of the lack of predicted warming.



Then there’s the problem of identifying the type of warming that is going on. Warming up the planet’s coldest air masses clearly creates little harm, because no plant or animal can feel the difference between -40 degrees and -35 degrees. Greenhouse physics predicts that warming is more likely in the coldest air masses. Indeed, there is some evidence that this is already occurring in Siberia and northwestern North America in winter. But it’s no threat. It’s pretty hard to melt ice caps at temperatures that are way below freezing.



Conversely, a warm, humid air mass, where things are living and growing, doesn’t respond much at all to greenhouse changes. So we expect to see less change in the summer. In fact, most observed summer changes are either small or insignificant, even in Siberia. All totaled, the effects of winter warming and little summer change lengthens the growing season, costs less energy and is, in general, hard to label as a big negative.



Some people have made careers out of labeling what I just wrote as the carpings of that “small band of vocal skeptics.” I hope they read the May 16 issue of _Science_ magazine. There, senior environmental reporter Richard Kerr found widespread discontent over the magnitude and even the detection of global warming. Kerr found, as predicted by the skeptics for 15 years now, that when climate models are cleansed of their “fudge factors” (his words) that they will produce precious little greenhouse warming in the next century.



Do this, and put in the most likely changes in the greenhouse effect for the next century, and you get 1.2 degrees Celsius of warming in a new climate model from the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research. From the new model of the United Kingdom Meteorological Organization, the same exercise will give you 1.3 degrees Celsius of warming. Or look at Tom Wigley’s completely independent calculation in _Nature_ last year. Same number: 1.3 degrees.



The message is that this is less than half of the warming predicted by the U.N.‘s “Consensus of Scientists” in 1990. And further, it’s now appreciated that most of this has to be in winter, as the rising temperature in Siberia is now informing us.



So the vice president is going to have to defend expensive and disruptive measures in the face of a very modest climate change whose most noticed effect will be to lengthen the growing season and reduce energy demand. The Senate will use the strength of the skeptics’ arguments to turn down any amendment to the Rio Treaty–which may actually be a blessing for Gore.



Defeat will enable the vice president to campaign in 1998 and 2000 on the attractive but spurious claim that Helms and the Republican leadership are going to kill our children because they won’t stop global warming. With global warming, as with Gore’s presidential ambitions, losing is winning.

It will not change the climate, it will do nothing useful for the planet and it will destroy real jobs faster than green jobs can be created.

"MOSCOW  —   Russian lawmakers on Wednesday moved to decriminalize some forms of domestic battery for   offenders who do not do serious physical harm to their victims. Members of the State Duma passed the controversial amendment to the Russian criminal code in its second reading, which essentially assures it will go to President Vladimir V. Putin for his signature. The amendment treats a first conviction for domestic battery as an administrative offense, carrying a penalty of a $500 fine or 15 days in jail. If Mr. Putin signs the measure into law, only injuries like concussions or broken bones, or repeated offenses committed in a family setting, would lead to criminal charges. Defenders of the measure say it will protect parents’ rights to discipline their children and generally reduce the state’s role in domestic life. “In the traditional Russian family culture, relations between ‘fathers and sons’ are built upon the authority of parents’ power, mutual love and personal indispensability as the basis for children’s upbringing,” said Yelena B. Mizulina, one of the initiators of the new legislation and author of a law that banned “gay propaganda” aimed at minors. Opponents called it a step back to medieval times and a license for violent behavior by domestic tyrants. “It is clear that lawmakers recognized violence as a norm of family life,” said Svetlana G. Aivazova, a Russian specialist in gender studies. “This shows that Duma deputies are not simply conservative or traditional, it shows that they are archaic. ” Ms. Aivazova and other experts say that Russia has a serious problem with domestic violence. Citing data provided by Russia’s Interior Ministry, Ms. Aivazova told Mr. Putin in 2015 that “40 percent of all grave violent crimes are committed in families. ” In 2013, she said, more than 9, 000 women died in criminal assaults and more than 11, 000 were badly injured. In 2014, she said, “more than 25 percent of all murders were committed in families. ” In the United States, by comparison, 11, 766 women were killed by a husband or boyfriend in the years 2001 to 2012, an average of about 1, 000 a year in a country with about twice the population of Russia. Ms. Aivazova asked Mr. Putin to support a special law on the prevention of domestic violence that had already been passed in 143 countries, including Russia’s   neighbors Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. Mr. Putin thanked her, but the law remained in the State Duma, and Ms. Aivazova said she was not optimistic about its prospects. In the past, Mr. Putin has expressed concern about domestic violence, even in the absence of serious injury. “I think we should not slap children and justify it based on some old traditions,” he told journalists at his last news conference in December. “There is a short distance from slaps to beating. ” The new legislation was pushed by conservative members of the Russian parliament and the Russian Orthodox Church, who were incensed last summer when lawmakers criminalized domestic violence, acting upon a recommendation by the Supreme Court. The Russian Orthodox Church, which has steadily increased its influence in social policy in recent years, said in a statement last year that physical punishment was a Russian tradition and thus should be protected as “an essential right given to parents by God. ” “There is absolutely no doubt that children should be defended against true criminal activities,” the church said. “But you cannot equate such criminal assaults with rational and moderate use of physical punishment by loving parents. ” Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of the State Duma, said the new legislation was a sign of the state’s determination to “make conditions for strong families to emerge. ”"

Guest Post by Bob Tisdale
This post provides an update of many of the ENSO-related variables we presented as part of the 2014-15 El Niño Series and for the 2015/16 El Niño series.
INTRODUCTION 
In the recent post Say Good-Bye to the 2015/16 El Niño, we illustrated and discussed how the weekly sea surface temperature anomalies of the NINO3.4 region of the equatorial Pacific had dropped below NOAA’s +0.5 deg C threshold for El Niño conditions for the week centered on May 18th.  Weekly sea surface temperature anomalies for that region are now below zero.
We noted in the April update that both Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) and the U.S.’s NOAA have issued La Niña alerts for the ENSO season of 2016/17. (BOM notice is here, and NOAA advisory is here.) Sea surface temperature anomalies for the equatorial Pacific are rapidly moving in the direction.
The questions now:  If a La Niña forms and persists, how strong with will the 2016/17 La Niña be?  Will it last for a single-season, or will it be a multiyear La Niña like the 1998-01 La Niña that followed the 1997/98 El Niño, or will there be back-to-back La Niñas like we saw in 2010/11 and 2011/12 (See the current version of NOAA’s Oceanic NINO Index) and in 2007/08 and 2008/09 when NOAA was using the ERSST.v3b data for its Oceanic NINO Index)?
Back to your regularly scheduled update…
ENSO METRIC UPDATES
This post provides an update on the progress of the evolution and decay of the 2015/16 El Niño with monthly data through the end of April 2016, and for the weekly data through late-May, 2016. The post is similar in layout to the updates that were part of the 2014/15 El Niño series of posts here and the series of posts about the 2015/16 El Niño here. The remainder of the post includes a bunch of illustrations and a gif animation, so it might take a few moments to load on your browser.  Please click on the illustrations to enlarge them.
Included are updates of the weekly sea surface temperature anomalies for the four most-often-used NINO regions. Also included are a couple of graphs of the monthly BOM Southern-Oscillation Index (SOI) and the NOAA Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI).
For the comparison graphs we’re using the El Niño evolution years of 1997/98 and 1982/83 where possible (the two strongest El Niño events during recent decades) as references for 2015/16.
Also included in this post are evolution comparisons using warm water volume anomalies and depth-averaged temperature anomalies from the NOAA TOA project website.
Then, we’ll take a look at a number of Hovmoller diagrams comparing the progress so far for the 2015/16 El Niño to the El Niños of 1982/83 and 1997/98.
NINO REGION TIME-SERIES GRAPHS
Note: The weekly NINO region sea surface temperature anomaly data for Figure 1 are from the NOAA/CPC Monthly Atmospheric & SST Indices webpage, specifically the data here.  The anomalies for the NOAA/CPC data are referenced to the base years of 1981-2010.
Figure 1 includes the weekly sea surface temperature anomalies of the 4 most-often-used NINO regions of the equatorial Pacific. From west to east they include:

NINO4 (5S-5N, 160E-150W)
NINO3.4 (5S-5N, 170W-120W)
NINO3 (5S-5N, 150W-90W)
NINO1+2 (10S-0, 90W-80W)


Figure 1
Note that the horizontal red (positive anomalies) and blue (negative anomalies) lines in the graphs are the present readings, not the trends.
The sea surface temperature anomalies for the easternmost NINO1+2 region have recently been cycling below and above zero.  The anomalies for NINO3 and NINO3.4 regions have recently turned negative.
NOTE:  The NINO4 region should follow soon.  In response to the recent upwelling Kelvin wave, the subsurface waters below the equatorial Pacific have become cooler than normal for the most part.  That is, the warmer-than-normal subsurface waters below the equatorial Pacific have mostly departed.  See Supplemental Figure 1, which is the most-recent cross section of equatorial subsurface temperature anomalies from the NOAA-GODAS website here.

EL NIÑO EVOLUTION COMPARISONS FOR NINO REGION SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE ANOMALIES
Using weekly sea surface temperature anomalies for the four NINO regions, Figure 2 compares the 2015/16 El Niño with the 1997/98 event. (That weekly data start in January 1990, so we can’t include the 1982/83 El Niño.)  While sea surface temperature anomalies in the NINO4 and NINO3.4 regions peaked higher than in 1997, the NINO1+2 and NINO3 regions lagged well behind the 1997/98 El Niño.  In other words, the 1997/98 El Niño was a stronger East Pacific El Niño than the 2015/16 El Niño.
We also showed in the post here that the differences between sea surface temperature datasets and their uncertainties keep us from knowing which El Niño was strongest. 
The NINO region sea surface temperature anomalies are continuing to show declines as the El Niño transitions to La Niña.  The weekly data are impacted by “weather noise” so we might expect to see another couple of upticks from time to time, but the 2015/16 El Niño decayed and is transitioning to La Niña on schedule.  El Niños are tied to the seasonal cycle and typically peak in November to January. See the post here.

THE MULTIVARIATE ENSO INDEX
The Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI) is another ENSO index published by NOAA.  It was created and is maintained by NOAA’s Klaus Wolter.  The Multivariate ENSO Index uses the sea surface temperatures of the NINO3 region of the equatorial Pacific, along with a plethora of atmospheric variables…thus “multivariate”.
According to the most recent Multivariate ENSO Index update discussion, the El Niño conditions are decaying and “dropping below a Top-3 ranking”:
Compared to last month, the updated (March-April) MEI has stabilized (up by 0.11) at +2.07, continuing just below a Top-3 ranking for the second month in a row. The preceding nine-month run in the Top-3 is tied with 1982-83 for its duration, while 1997-98 kept this level going for a full 12 months. No other El Niño since 1950 even exceeded three months at that level. The August-September 2015 MEI of +2.53 represents the peak of the 2015-16 event, and was exceeded only during the 1982-83 and 1997-98 events. The overall evolution of the 2015-16 El Niño has been most similar to 1997-98, as monitored by the MEI.
There’s something else to consider about the MEI.  El Niño and La Niña rankings according to the MEI aren’t based on fixed threshold values such as +0.5 for El Niño and -0.5 for La Niña.  The MEI El Niño and La Niña rankings are based on percentiles, top 30% for the weak to strong El Niños and the bottom 30% for the weak to strong La Niñas.   This is difficult to track, because, when using the percentile method, the thresholds of El Niño and La Niña conditions vary from one bimonthly period to the next, and they can change from year to year.
The Multivariate ENSO Index update discussion and data for March/April were posted on May 6th.  Figure 3 presents a graph of the MEI time series starting in Dec/Jan 1979.  And Figure 4 compares the evolution in 2015/16 to the reference El Niños of 1982/83 and 1997/98.

According to NOAA’s Multivariate ENSO Index, the 2015/16 El Niño was weaker than the 1982/83 and 1997/98 events.
EL NIÑO EVOLUTION COMPARISONS WITH TAO PROJECT SUBSURFACE DATA
IMPORTANT NOTE:  The 1982 values of the TAO Project subsurface data have to be taken with a grain of salt. The deployment of the TOA project buoys started in the late 1980s and was not compete until the early 1990s.  Also keep in mind that these values are the output of a reanalysis (a computer model), not observations-only-based data. [End note.]
The NOAA Tropical Atmosphere-Ocean (TAO) Project website includes the outputs of a reanalysis for two temperature-related datasets for the waters below the surface of the equatorial Pacific.  See their new Upper Ocean Heat Content and ENSO webpage for descriptions of the datasets and for a link to the data presented in the following graphs.   The two datasets are Warm Water Volume (above the 20 deg C isotherm) and the Depth-Averaged Temperatures for the top 300 meters (aka T300).  Both are available for the:

Western Equatorial Pacific (5S-5N, 120E-155W)
Eastern Equatorial Pacific (5S-5N, 155W-80W)
Total Equatorial Pacific (5S-5N, 120E-80W)

Keep in mind that the longitudes of 120E-80W stretch 160 deg, almost halfway around the globe. For a reminder of width of the equatorial Pacific, see the protractor-based illustration here. Notice also that the eastern and western data are divided at 155W, which means the “western” data extend quite a ways past the dateline into the eastern equatorial Pacific.
Note:  After a recent temporary reformatting, the TAO Project website has returned their data webpage to its original format.  They’re available here. [End note.]
In the following three illustrations, we’re comparing reanalysis outputs for the evolution of the 2015/16 El Niño so far (through April 2016) with the outputs for the evolutions of the 1982/83 and 1997/98 El Niños. The Warm Water Volume outputs are the top graphs and the depth-averaged temperature (T300) outputs are the bottom graphs.  As you’ll see, the curves of two datasets are similar, but not necessarily the same.
Let’s start with the Western Equatorial Pacific (5S-5N, 120E-155W), Figure 5. The warm water volume and depth-averaged temperature anomalies show the Western Equatorial Pacific began 2015 with noticeably less warm water than during the opening months of 1997.  The western equatorial Pacific supplies the warm water for an El Niño.  Claims that El Niños are becoming stronger due to human-induced global warming are obviously not supported by the subsurface data from the western equatorial Pacific.  The warm water volume in 1982 was comparable at the start of 2015 but depth-averaged temperature anomalies started off higher in 2015 than in 1982. Notice how there was a much greater decline in 1997/98 than 2015/16.  That indicates more warm water migrated eastward from the western tropical Pacific during the 1997/98 event than in 2015/16….another indication that the 2015/16 El Niño was weaker that the one in 1997/98.

Figure 5
Both warm water volume and depth-averaged temperature anomalies in the Eastern equatorial Pacific (5S-5N, 155W-80W) in 2015/16 had lagged behind the values of 1997/98, but had been greater than the 1982/83 values for most of the event.  See Figure 6.  Both the warm water volume and T300 have recently fallen into line with those seen in 1997/98 and are now lower than the values in 1982/83.

Figure 6
Once again, with the noticeable differences between the 1997/98 and 2015/16 events, data contradict claims that the 2015/16 El Niño was stronger that the event of 1997/98.  
The total of the TAO project eastern and western equatorial subsurface temperature-related reanalysis outputs, Figure 7, are as one would expect looking at the subsets. Both the warm water volume and the subsurface T300 data show greater drops in 1997/98 than in 2015/16, suggesting that more heat was released from equatorial Pacific in 1997/98 than in 2015/16.

Figure 7
SOUTHERN OSCILLATION INDEX (SOI)
The Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) from Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology is another widely used reference for the strength, frequency and duration of El Niño and La Niña events.  We discussed the Southern Oscillation Index in Part 8 of the 2014/15 El Niño series. It is derived from the sea level pressures of Tahiti and Darwin, Australia, and as such it reflects the wind patterns off the equator in the southern tropical Pacific.  With the Southern Oscillation Index, El Niño events are strong negative values and La Niñas are strong positive values, which is the reverse of what we see with sea surface temperature-based indices.  The April Southern Oscillation Index value is -22.0, which is a greater negative value than the threshold of El Niño conditions. (The BOM threshold for El Niño conditions is an SOI value of -8.0.)  In other words, according to the SOI, we were in back in El Niño conditions last month. Figure 8 presents a time-series graph of the SOI data.  The BOM SOI data provide more indications that the 2015/16 event was comparable to or weaker than many El Niño events.

Figure 8
Note that the horizontal red line is the present monthly value, not a trend line.
The graphs in Figure 9 compare the evolution of the SOI values in 2015/16 to those in 1982/83 and 1997/98. The top graph shows the raw data. Because the SOI data are so volatile, I’ve smoothed them with 3-month filters in the bottom graph. Referring to the smoothed data, the Southern Oscillation Index has recently once again fallen behind the values in 1997 and is comparable to the values in 1982.

Figure 9
Also see the BOM Recent (preliminary) Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) values webpage. The 30-day running average has been running in ENSO-neutral conditions for the past week.  Will it stay there?
COMPARISONS OF HOVMOLLER DIAGRAMS OF THIS EL NIÑO (TO DATE) WITH 1982/83 AND 1997/98
NOTE:  For the following illustrations, I’ve extended the Hovmoller diagrams by splicing the 2016 portions of the most recent ones onto 2015 so that we can compare the evolutions and decays of the El Niños. [End note.]
Hovmoller diagrams are a great way to display data.  If they’re new to you, there’s no reason to be intimidated by them. Let’s take a look at Figure 10.  It presents the Hovmoller diagrams of thermocline depth anomalies (the depth of the isotherm at 20 deg C.  Water warmer than 20 deg C is above the 20 deg C isotherm and below it the water is cooler). 2015 is in the center, 1997 on the left and 1982 to the right.  (Sorry about the different sizes of the Hovmollers, but somewhere along the line NOAA GODAS changed them, but they are scaled, color-coded, the same.)
The vertical (y) axis in all the Hovmollers shown in this post is time with the first-year Januarys at the top and second-year Decembers at the bottom.  The horizontal (x) axis is longitude, so, moving from left to right in each of the three Hovmoller diagrams, we’re going from west to east…with the Indian Ocean in the left-hand portion, the Pacific in the center and the Atlantic in the right-hand portion.  We’re interested in the Pacific. The data are color-coded according to the scales below the Hovmollers.

Figure 10
Figure 10 is presenting the depth of the 20 deg C isotherm along a band from 2S to 2N. The positive anomalies, working their way eastward early in 1982, 1997 and 2015, were caused by downwelling Kelvin waves, which push down on the thermocline (the 20 deg C isotherm).  You’ll note how the anomalies grew in strength as the Kelvin wave migrated east. That does not mean the Kelvin wave is getting stronger as it traveled east; that simply indicates that the thermocline is normally closer to the surface in the eastern equatorial Pacific than it is in the western portion.  In this illustration, we’re looking at anomalies, not absolute values.
Based on thermocline depth anomalies, the El Niño conditions were much stronger in 1997/98 than they were in 1982/83 and in 2015/16.
The recent change to shallower-than-normal anomalies was initiated by an upwelling Kelvin wave.  The values in recent times appear to be lagging behind those in 1983 and 1998.
Figure 11 presents the Hovmollers for wind stress (not anomalies) along the equator.   The simplest way to explain them is that they’re presenting the impacts of the strengths and directions of the trade winds on the surfaces of the equatorial oceans. In this presentation, the effects of the east to west trade winds at various strengths are shown in blues, and the reversals of the trade winds into westerlies are shown in yellows, oranges and reds.  To explain the color coding, the trade winds normally blow from east to west; thus the cooler colors for stronger east to west trade winds. The reversals of the trade winds (the yellows, oranges and reds) are the unusual events and they’re associated with El Niños, which are the abnormal state of the tropical Pacific.  (A La Niña is simply an exaggerated normal state.)

Figure 11
The two westerly wind bursts shown in red in the western equatorial Pacific in 1997 are associated with the strong downwelling Kelvin wave that formed at the time. (See the post ENSO Basics: Westerly Wind Bursts Initiate an El Niño.) Same thing with the three westerly wind bursts early in 2015, January through April:  they initiated the Kelvin wave this year. Throughout 1997, there was a series of westerly wind bursts in the western equatorial Pacific. Same thing occurred in 2015. There were comparatively few westerly wind bursts early in 1982, and the bursts early in 1982 appear to have been weaker than those in 1997 and 2015, according to this GODAS reanalysis. But there was a strong westerly wind burst later in 1982.  Returning to 2015/16, the most recent westerly wind burst happened in January 2016.
Based on what happened in 1983 and 1998, we may not expect to see another westerly wind burst until October-December of 2016, and then the westerly wind bursts would likely be weak by comparison to those that occurred during the El Niños.
Figure 12 presents the Hovmollers of wind stress anomalies…just a different perspective.  But positive wind stress anomalies, at the low end of the color-coded scale, are actually a weakening of the trade winds, not necessarily a reversal.

Figure 12
NOTE: There are a number of wind stress-related images on meteorological websites.  Always check to see if they’re presenting absolute values or anomalies.  [End note.]
And Figure 13 presents the Hovmollers of sea surface temperature anomalies along the equator.

Figure 13
Notice the extremely high sea surface temperature anomalies in the eastern equatorial Pacific during the peak of the 1997/98 El Niño. While the sea surface temperatures in 2015/16 had reached well above threshold of a strong El Niño, they were still well behind those of the 1997/98 El Niño…especially east of 120W (to about 90W), where sea surface temperature anomalies were more than 4.0 deg C. In 1982/83, sea surface temperature anomalies also reached 4.0 deg C, but we never reached those values in 2015/16.
That is, as noted earlier, the 1997/98 was a stronger East Pacific El Niño than the 2015/16 event.
Currently, sea surface temperature anomalies are where we would expect them for the transition from El Niño to La Niña conditions.
THE SLOW MOVING ROSSBY WAVES NORTH AND SOUTH OF THE EQUATOR
In the March ENSO update, we discussed how the most recent downwelling Kevin wave (initiated by the January 2016 Westerly Wind Burst) appeared to split the pocket of subsurface warm waters in the eastern equatorial Pacific in February 2016, creating two pockets of warm subsurface waters…one north of the equator and another south of the equator.  Those two pockets of warm subsurface waters (leftovers from the El Niño) are now migrating westward very slowly…very slowly (as Rossby waves).  In Animation 1, I’ve included an animation of the sea level residual maps from the JPL website here, starting in December 2015, through the most recent map dated May 22nd.

Animation 1
During the upcoming posts about the 2016/17 La Niña, we’ll discuss the impacts of that leftover warm water.
The last downwelling Kelvin wave (started in January 2016) was followed two months later by a strong upwelling Kelvin wave. Thus, the negative sea level residuals along the equator.

"**Hong Kong has seen several months of pro-democracy protests - and China appears to be tightening its grip.**
The protests began in June 2019 over plans - later put on ice, and finally withdrawn in September - that would have allowed extradition from Hong Kong to mainland China. They then spread to reflect wider demands for democratic reform, and an inquiry into alleged police brutality.
Now, China is proposing to introduce a new national security law, which critics believe could be used to crack down on rights and political activists.
This is not all happening in a vacuum. There's a lot of important context - some of it stretching back decades - that helps explain what is going on.
It's important to remember that Hong Kong is significantly different from other Chinese cities. To understand this, you need to look at its history.
It was a British colony for more than 150 years - part of it, Hong Kong island, was ceded to the UK after a war in 1842. Later, China also leased the rest of Hong Kong - the New Territories - to the British for 99 years.
It became a busy trading port, and its economy took off in the 1950s as it became a manufacturing hub.
The territory was also popular with migrants and dissidents fleeing instability, poverty or persecution in mainland China.
Then, in the early 1980s, as the deadline for the 99-year-lease approached, Britain and China began talks on the future of Hong Kong - with the communist government in China arguing that all of Hong Kong should be returned to Chinese rule.
The two sides signed a treaty in 1984 that would see Hong Kong return to China in 1997, under the principle of ""one country, two systems"".
This meant that while becoming part of one country with China, Hong Kong would enjoy ""a high degree of autonomy, except in foreign and defence affairs"" for 50 years.
As a result, Hong Kong has its own legal system and borders, and rights including freedom of assembly, free speech and freedom of the press are protected.
For example, it is one of the few places in Chinese territory where people can commemorate the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, where the military opened fire on unarmed protesters in Beijing.
Hong Kong still enjoys freedoms not seen in mainland China - but they are widely thought to be on the decline.
Rights groups have accused China of meddling in Hong Kong, citing examples such as legal rulings that have disqualified pro-democracy legislators, and the disappearance of five Hong Kong booksellers, and a tycoon - who all eventually re-emerged in custody in China.
There are also accusations that press and academic freedoms have been deteriorating. In March, China effectively expelled several US journalists - but also prohibited them from working in Hong Kong.
The public broadcaster RTHK has come under pressure from Hong Kong's government, first for broadcasting an interview with the World Health Organization about Taiwan, and then for targeting police in its satirical news show ""Headliner"".
The local examinations body also came under fire for a world history question about relations between Japan and China, with the government demanding the exam question be invalidated. The government said it was a professional, rather than political, decision, but many academics expressed concern.
Another sticking point has been democratic reform.
Hong Kong's leader, the chief executive, is currently elected by a 1,200-member election committee - a mostly pro-Beijing body chosen by just 6% of eligible voters.
Not all the 70 members of the territory's lawmaking body, the Legislative Council, are directly chosen by Hong Kong's voters. Most seats not directly elected are occupied by pro-Beijing lawmakers.
Some elected members have even been disbarred after Beijing issued a controversial legal ruling that effectively disqualified them.
Hong Kong's mini-constitution, the Basic Law, says that ultimately both the leader, and the Legislative Council, should be elected in a more democratic way - but there's been disagreement over what this should look like.
The Chinese government said in 2014 it would allow voters to choose their leaders from a list approved by a pro-Beijing committee, but critics called this a ""sham democracy"" and it was voted down in Hong Kong's legislature.
In 28 years' time in 2047, the Basic Law expires - and what happens to Hong Kong's autonomy after that is unclear.
While most people in Hong Kong are ethnic Chinese, and although Hong Kong is part of China, a majority of people there don't identify as Chinese.
Surveys from the University of Hong Kong show that most people identify themselves as ""Hong Kongers"" \- only 11% would call themselves ""Chinese"" \- and 71% of people say they do not feel proud about being Chinese citizens.
The difference is particularly pronounced amongst the young.
""The younger the respondents, the less likely they feel proud of becoming a national citizen of China, and also the more negative they are toward the Central Government's policies on Hong Kong,"" the university's public opinion programme says.
Hong Kongers have described legal, social and cultural differences - and the fact Hong Kong was a separate colony for 150 years - as reasons why they don't identify with their compatriots in mainland China.
There has also been a rise in anti-mainland Chinese sentiment in Hong Kong in recent years, with people complaining about rude tourists disregarding local norms or driving up the cost of living.
Some young activists have even called for Hong Kong's independence from China, something that alarms the Beijing government.
There's a rich history of dissent in Hong Kong, stretching back further even than the past few years.
In 1966, demonstrations broke out after the Star Ferry Company decided to increase its fares. The protests escalated into riots, a full curfew was declared and hundreds of troops took to the streets.
Protests have continued since 1997, but now the biggest ones tend to be of a political nature - and bring demonstrators into conflict with mainland China's position.
While Hong Kongers have a degree of autonomy, they have little liberty in the polls, meaning protests are one of the few ways they can make their opinions heard.
As a result, many see taking to the streets as their only way of forcing change.
And, in the past, some protests have been successful. In 2003, up to 500,000 people took to the streets to protest against a controversial security bill the Hong Kong government was trying to pass. The local government also backed down over ""patriotic education"" classes following rallies against the move.
However, the Chinese government has adopted a harder stance in recent years, particularly with any movements it views as a direct challenge to its own authority.
In 2014, demonstrators took to the streets peacefully for several weeks, demanding Hong Kongers be given the right to elect their own leader. But the so-called Umbrella movement eventually fizzled out with no concessions from Beijing.
In June 2019, protesters took to the streets again, demonstrating against plans to allow extraditions to mainland China. This time, clashes between police and activists became increasingly violent.
The bill was halted, and later fully withdrawn, but demonstrations continued for months, with demands for full democracy and an independent inquiry into police actions.
In April this year, Hong Kong police arrested 15 of the city's most high-profile pro-democracy activists for taking part in unauthorised assemblies.
In May, Hong Kong's police watchdog said it found no significant wrongdoing on the police's part during the 2019 protests - in a report that was criticised by many rights groups and external experts.
The street protests have mostly died down during the coronavirus pandemic, although some small demonstrations, including singing protesters in shopping malls, have started again as restrictions are gradually eased.
Now, China is proposing to introduce a new national security law in Hong Kong, which could be similar to the one withdrawn in 2003. It says the legislation is ""highly necessary"" and would ""safeguard national security in Hong Kong"".
However, the new proposal is also controversial because it is expected to circumvent Hong Kong's own law-making processes - leading to accusations that Beijing is undermining Hong Kong's autonomy."
"**Chinese state media outlets have attempted to downplay the results of Hong Kong's district elections, which saw the pro-democracy camp score a landslide victory.**
The government had been hoping the election would bring a show of support from the so-called ""silent majority"" opposed to the protests.
Instead, it saw some significant pro-Beijing candidates lose council seats.
Chief Executive Carrie Lam has acknowledged public ""unhappiness"".
In her first public appearance since the results, she said she recognised that people were concerned over ""deficiencies in governance, including unhappiness with the time taken to deal with the unstable environment"".
However, she offered no new concessions.
Reaction from state media outlets has ranged from making no reference at all to election results to overt claims that ""tampering"" had taken place.
State broadcaster CCTV's daily news programme Xinwen Lianbo stayed silent on the results, instead accusing the US of interference.
Xinhua, the state's press agency, made some allusion to the fact that elections had taken place over the weekend but pivoted back to the violence of recent weeks, stressing the need to restore order.
News outlet the Global Times did cover the elections in detail, concluding in an English-language article that the pan-democrats had ""scored a big win"".
However, the report also said there was ""no need to over-interpret the victory of pan-democrats"".
The Global Times' editor Hu Xijin, known for his outspoken comments, mentioned on Chinese social media site Weibo that the pro-Beijing camp had failed, but added that the district council elections were on a very ""local level"".
English-language paper China Daily reported that the elections had concluded, but made no reference to the pro-democracy camp's victory.
China Daily separately posted a picture on Twitter with the caption: ""That's how the oppositions [sic] tampers with a fair election.""
The picture accuses protesters - without evidence - of taking citizens' ID cards to stop them from casting their votes, and of misleading the elderly to vote for pro-democracy councillors.
**Stephen McDonnell, BBC News, Hong Kong**
For Beijing, for Carrie Lam's administration and even Hong Kong's police force, the district council elections have just punched a large hole in their ""silent majority"" narrative.
The message from the establishment had been that most residents were fed up with protesters and wanted the government to crack down hard on them.
The problem with that line now is that district council elections didn't pan out that way and in fact revealed sentiments overwhelmingly in the opposite direction.
Hong Kong's leader is already being criticised over her first public appearance since the election, when she said people wanted to ""go back to their normal lives"" and could ""no longer tolerate the chaos"" of demonstrations.
It's hard to see how this argument can be sustained given that the electorate has overwhelmingly voted for a rejection of the way things were, and winning pro-democracy candidates saying that a return to the status quo is not an option.
The central government in Beijing has chosen a much more blunt instrument by stopping virtually all television, radio and newspaper coverage from mentioning the actual election result and hoping that not too many people on the Chinese mainland hear about it via social media.
After all this is a pretty hard one to explain given that, prior to this weekend, story after story in China's state-run media had been portraying the protest movement as a bunch of fringe vandals making life miserable for most in Hong Kong.
Hong Kong's district councillors have only limited political influence - they most deal with very local issues like transport and amenities.
But Sunday's election drew particular attention because it was the first vote to take place since anti-government protests first began in June.
Some of the councillors will also play a role in choosing the next chief executive, Hong Kong's leader.
A record 4.1 million people had registered to vote - more than half the population - and more than 1,000 candidates ran for 452 electable seats.
Candidates sympathetic to the pro-democracy cause won a total of 347 seats and according to local media, now control 17 of the 18 councils.
The protests were triggered by a bill which would have allowed suspects to be extradited to mainland China.
This bill prompted fears that China was increasingly encroaching on the city's autonomy, including its right to judicial independence.
It was eventually withdrawn but the movement has now evolved into a broader protest against the way the city is run.
Earlier last week, US lawmakers overwhelmingly passed legislation in support of Hong Kong's protesters.
On Monday, China's foreign ministry summoned the US ambassador to protest against the passing of the bill, accusing the US of ""meddling in Hong Kong affairs and interfering in China's internal matters"".
Beijing warned there would be ""consequences"" if the bill is signed into law."

Don’t we just love to speculate about politics. To analyse the polls and guess at what we think might happen. The scenarios can be many and varied and of course some of our views are deeply influenced by our own wishful thinking.



For example, there’s nothing I’d like more than to see the current bunch of inept losers tossed out on their ears in September, and I could make many very positive and convincing cases for how that could happen. Similarly, albeit with a whole lot less enthusiasm, I could make a very strong and persuasive case for the status quo remaining.



The polls give us something to work with but they’ve been so wrong so often lately, that it’s impossible to come up with anything useful relying on them alone. So we fall back on experience, general knowledge, history, psychology, personal opinion, some poll results and of course to some degree, what neighbours chat about over the fence or conversations overheard in pubs.



The completely unscientific consensus I’m getting from many quarters is firstly, that despite what this week’s polls say, the Greens and NZ First will get past the 5% mark. 



Secondly, despite the complete lack of delivery and the highly embarrassing failures so far, Labour have increased their popularity since the last election and will probably end up with a higher vote and more seats. Meanwhile, Ms Ardern continues to [walk on water.](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/jacinda-ardern-walks-on-water/)



Thirdly, National in its current form is not as popular as it was at the last election and even committed past National supporters can’t see their way clear to voting for them. They won’t see their way clear to voting for anybody else, so those people probably won’t vote at all unless National can do something convincing for them.



Fourthly, there is a large group of “junior” citizens who have the right to vote for the first time this year and they are heavily influenced by genuine green, conservation issues as well as the climate change hoax. They don’t see Green Party socialism and social engineering as an issue and probably don’t understand it. They like getting things for free and as most of them haven’t had to face the reality of earning a living and working between one and two days a week to pay tax alone, they’re happy to roll with what they perceive as being good for the planet. If they can be mobilised to put down their phones and go to a polling station on the day, that could be a very real game-changer.



At the end of the day, what happens on election day is of course what counts and though the people will determine who ends up at the finish line, those who make it to the finish line will get to then negotiate the real winners and losers of the overall event and those negotiations will determine who will actually govern.



That’s why a wise politician might choose to keep all options open until the last possible moment pending those negotiations.



Ms Ardern will be quietly smiling to herself. 



Painful thought isn’t it.

Ronald Reagan was the most eloquent spokesman for limited government of our time. Through 25 years of tirelessly “raising a banner of no pale pastels, but bold colors” of political principle, he succeeded in changing the climate of opinion in the United States and around the world.



From his first appearance on the national political scene in 1964, he spoke for the values he set forth in his nationally televised speech just before that election:



This idea that government was beholden to the people, that it had no other source of power is still the newest, most unique idea in all the long history of man’s relation to man. This is the issue of this election: Whether we believe in our capacity for self‐​government or whether we abandon the American Revolution and confess that a little intellectual elite in a far‐​distant capital can plan our lives for us better than we can plan them ourselves.



You and I are told we must choose between a left or right, but I suggest there is no such thing as a left or right. There is only an up or down. Up to man’s age‐​old dream — the maximum of individual freedom consistent with order — or down to the ant heap of totalitarianism. Regardless of their sincerity, their humanitarian motives, those who would sacrifice freedom for security have embarked on this downward path. Plutarch warned, “The real destroyer of the liberties of the people is he who spreads among them bounties, donations and benefits.”



The Founding Fathers knew a government can’t control the economy without controlling people. And they knew when a government sets out to do that, it must use force and coercion to achieve its purpose. 



As a liberal who moved to the right, he might have been called the first neoconservative. Except that he had been a liberal anticommunist, not a communist like the original neoconservatives. And his conservatism involved making government smaller, not using big government for conservative goals. We miss that kind of conservatism in Washington today.



In his first inaugural address, he proclaimed,



In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.



It is my intention to curb the size and influence of the Federal establishment and to demand recognition of the distinction between the powers granted to the Federal Government and those reserved to the States or to the people. All of us need to be reminded that the Federal Government did not create the States; the States created the Federal Government. 



His actions in office did not always fulfill those promises. Government spending continued to grow, there was little devolution of power to the states, and the cost of federal regulation continued to increase. Instead of abolishing two Cabinet departments, as he had promised (Education and Energy), he created one (Veterans Affairs). We owe to him the presidencies of George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush, neither of whom shared his commitment to liberty and limited government.



Nevertheless, after he succeeded a president who gave us good reason to believe that our nation was in a malaise, he revived our spirits and our faith in free enterprise. He slashed marginal tax rates and revived the sagging economy. Along with Margaret Thatcher, he both symbolized and galvanized a renewed enthusiasm for entrepreneurship and free markets. In his second inaugural, he echoed his words from 20 years earlier:



By 1980, we knew it was time to renew our faith, to strive with all our strength toward the ultimate in individual freedom consistent with an orderly society. We believed then and now there are no limits to growth and human progress when men and women are free to follow their dreams. 



Reagan was regarded as a social conservative, and he often spoke of “our values of faith, family, work, and neighborhood.” But he rarely sought to use government to impose those values. In 1978 he spoke out against an antigay initiative in California. Robert Kaiser of the _Washington Post,_ noting that the Reagans were the first White House occupants to have hosted a gay couple overnight, dubbed him in 1984 a “closet tolerant.”



Much of Reagan’s presidency, of course, was dominated by the Cold War and the long struggle with communism. In a 1983 speech he shocked the chattering classes by telling the truth about the Soviet Union:



Let us pray for the salvation of all of those who live in that totalitarian darkness — pray they will discover the joy of knowing God. But until they do, let us be aware that while they preach the supremacy of the state, declare its omnipotence over individual man, and predict its eventual domination of all peoples on the Earth, they are the focus of evil in the modern world.…



I believe that communism is another sad, bizarre chapter in human history whose last pages even now are being written.…



I urge you to beware the temptation of pride — the temptation of blithely declaring yourselves above it all and label both sides equally at fault, to ignore the facts of history and the aggressive impulses of an evil empire.



One could debate the advisability of particular foreign policy initiatives, but it was surely a good thing to be honest about the nature of totalitarian communism. His words declared an end to “moral equivalence” and a determination to seize the moral high ground in the struggle with communism, and they inspired people behind the Iron Curtain to believe that they might indeed be able to put an end to the “sad, bizarre chapter of human history” they were forced to live through.



As the last pages of that chapter did indeed begin to unfold, Reagan went to Berlin and in perhaps his most famous words ever, issued a challenge to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev:



General Secretary Gorbachev, if you seek peace, if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, if you seek liberalization: Come here to this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate. Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall! 



A year later, in 1988, Reagan visited Gorbachev in Moscow. Allowed to speak to students at Moscow State University, he gave them a brilliant discussion of the nature of a free society:



The explorers of the modern era are the entrepreneurs, men with vision, with the courage to take risks and faith enough to brave the unknown. These entrepreneurs and their small enterprises are responsible for almost all the economic growth in the United States. They are the prime movers of the technological revolution. In fact, one of the largest personal computer firms in the United States was started by two college students, no older than you, in the garage behind their home.…



We are seeing the power of economic freedom spreading around the world — places such as the Republic of Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan have vaulted into the technological era, barely pausing in the industrial age along the way. Low‐​tax agricultural policies in the sub‐​continent mean that in some years India is now a net exporter of food. Perhaps most exciting are the winds of change that are blowing over the People’s Republic of China, where one‐​quarter of the world’s population is now getting its first taste of economic freedom.…



Go into any schoolroom, and there you will see children being taught the Declaration of Independence, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights — among them life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness — that no government can justly deny — the guarantees in their Constitution for freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, and freedom of religion.…



But freedom is more even than this: Freedom is the right to question, and change the established way of doing things. It is the continuing revolution of the marketplace. It is the understanding that allows us to recognize shortcomings and seek solutions. It is the right to put forth an idea, scoffed at by the experts, and watch it catch fire among the people. It is the right to stick — to dream — to follow your dream, or stick to your conscience, even if you’re the only one in a sea of doubters. 



Freedom is the recognition that no single person, no single authority of government has a monopoly on the truth, but that every individual life is infinitely precious. 



Ronald Reagan often said that “the very heart and soul of conservatism is libertarianism.” I heard him say that at Vanderbilt University in 1975, when I had the honor to dine with him before his speech and get his signature on my “Reagan for President” newsletter. These days I put it somewhat differently: the best aspect of American conservatism is its commitment to protecting the individual liberties proclaimed in the Declaration of Independence and guaranteed in the Constitution. Ronald Reagan spoke for that brand of conservatism. That’s the conservatism we sorely miss in today’s Washington and today’s Republican party.

28 January, 2017 – Now updated to 133 papers

In 2014, there were at least 93 peer-reviewed scientific papers published in scientific journals affirming the Sun’s influential role in climate change.
In 2015, there were at least 95 scientific papers affirming the Sun-Climate link.
Already in 2016, there have been over 100 papers (107 to date) published in science journals affirming the link between solar forcing and climate change.  The list of papers and brief excerpts (from the abstracts, introductions, and/or conclusions) is provided below.
The Sun’s Influence On Climate: ‘Settled’ Science?
It has long been claimed that the science is “settled”, that the Sun’s role in climate change is negligible at best.
The Sun no longer causes net global-scale changes in deep ocean heat.  Humans do that now.   By emitting carbon dioxide, it is claimed that humans have predominantly caused (or will cause) net global-scale changes in precipitation, extreme weather events (hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts, floods…), water vapor, clouds, sea level, and, of course, atmospheric and surface temperatures.   According to some interpretations (i.e., NASA’s Gavin Schmidt), the IPCC apparently estimates that the anthropogenic attribution to climate change is essentially 100% (or more), and the Sun’s influence in forcing net changes in the climate system is effectively zero.
Of course, a 0% attribution for solar forcing assumes that we presently know enough already about the Sun and how it influences terrestrial climate change and ocean heat flux.   It assumes that we are and have been accurately calculating the response of the climate system to variations in absorbed solar heat energy, and that we are and have been accurately measuring absorbed solar heat energy.  It assumes there is little uncertainty and there are no consequential errors in our reconstructions and modeling of solar radiative forcing over time (or recently).

The popularized insistence by advocates that a 100% attribution for anthropogenic climate forcing is “settled” science necessarily implies that skepticism concerning the claim that there is effectively no Sun-Climate link is unwarranted and antagonistically feckless.   Those who do dare question the profundity of our present scientific knowledge of the Sun-Climate link deserved to be ridiculed, marginalized, and compared to Holocaust deniers.
Fortunately, there are still some scientists willing to admit that we still don’t know all that much about the Sun’s role in climate change.  For example, Dhomse et al. (2016) acknowledge that the Sun’s role in climate change is still “an open scientific question” due to the immense difficulties in accurately quantifying the Sun’s influence.
Dhomse et al., 2016
[T]here are still large [uncertainties] in current observational and meteorological reanalysis datasets, so accurate quantification of the influence of solar flux variability on the climate system remains an open scientific question.
And below, there are literally hundreds of scientists who have dared to continue trying to disentangle the Sun’s role in climate changes — and who have wound up finding robust connections.  Perhaps someday the IPCC will consider scientific papers like these in their reports rather than continue to operate on the presupposition that our scientific knowledge of the Sun’s role in climate change is not only substantial, but sufficient.

2016 Scientific Papers Linking The Sun To Climate Changes (100+)
1.  Sánchez-Sesma, 2016       [W]e found that, on one side, the recent CO2 increase can be considered as a lagged response to solar activity, and, on the other side, the continental tropical climate signal during late Holocene can be considered as a sum of three lagged responses to solar activity, through direct, and indirect (volcanic and CO2), influences with different lags of around 40, 800 and 1600 years.
2.  Yamakawa et al., 2016       This study attempted to determine the relationships between solar activity and SST. Instrumental data from 1901 to 2011 revealed a significant positive relationship on a global basis. … The analysis of the relationship between variations in solar activity and SST from 1901 to 2011 indicated that sunspot numbers and SST were positively correlated in wide areas, with statistically significant positive correlations in many regions…. Analyses of the relationships between solar activity and the Earth’s climate system also revealed relationships between variations in solar activity and circulation in the troposphere. It is worthy of note that the highest coefficients at a 29-month lag were found in the relationships both between SSN [sunspot number] and PDO [Pacific Decadal Oscillation], and SSN and CP El Niño with statistical significance at the 99% confidence level, respectively.
3.  Luening and Vahrenholt, 2016       The amplitude of the observed temperature fluctuations is often more than 1°C and thus has a similar or even greater range than the warming that has occurred since the Little Ice Age. Furthermore, many of these Holocene, natural climate fluctuations show the same level of abruptness as the 20th-century warming. A common characteristic of many of the documented millennial climate fluctuations is their good match with solar activity changes, as well as a North Atlantic climate record by Bond et al. (2001). Besides solar activity changes, internal millennial ocean cycles may have contributed to the observed climate oscillations.
4.  de Larminat, 2016       [T]he recent anthropogenic contribution is found to be less than the contribution of solar activity. Reflecting the predominance of internal variability in the error output, the natural contribution (solar and volcanic activities, plus internal variability) becomes clearly much greater than the anthropogenic contribution in the recent warming.
5.  Harde, 2016       Including solar and cloud effects as well as all relevant feedback processes our simulations give an equilibrium climate sensitivity of CS = 0.7 °C (temperature increase at doubled CO2) and a solar sensitivity of SS = 0.17 °C (at 0.1 % increase of the total solar irradiance). Then CO2 contributes 40 % and the Sun 60 % to global warming over the last century.
6.  Bonomo et al., 2016       The calcareous nannofossil assemblages as well as their diversity index are modulated by oscillation in solar activity, where minima in solar activity correspond to minima calcareous nannofossil diversity and vice versa. In particular, the antiphase correlation between the abundance of Reworked Coccoliths and the North Atlantic Oscillation index, which modulates winter precipitation, suggests that this biotic index could be used as a reliable proxy to reconstruct the variations in the hydrographic basin runoff of the Volturno and Garigliano rivers. In addition, power spectral and wavelet analysis carried out on both signals documented the occurrence of climatic cycles of the duration of about 95 yr. From 1900 AD upwards, a turnover in the periodicity from 95 yr climatic cycles to 22–26 yr cycles occurred in the Reworked Coccoliths signal, suggesting a strong control of solar forcing (Hale cycle) over the last century.
7.  Malik et al., 2016       In this study, we undertake another effort towards understanding the role of the Sun in changing or varying the Earth’s climate on seasonal to decadal time scale. We focus on effects of varying solar activity on All Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall (AISMR) and try to investigate how much the prediction of AISMR on a seasonal to decadal time scale can be improved by considering the solar irradiance variability in climate models. … Further, in our analysis we have found strong statistical evidence of the influence of solar activity on AMO and AISMR. We have found highly statistically significant evidence that North Atlantic SSTs are positively correlated with TSI on annual (CC 0.46), decadal (CC 0.55) and multidecadal time scales (CC 0.42) during the period 1600-2000. Also AMO influences the Niño3 and AISMR.
8.  Salau et al., 2016       Discussion of the Results: For each location, the mean temperature increases with rising insolation [surface solar radition] while the resulting increase in the precipitation is highest among the three variables. … The mean temperature and precipitation, averaged over 1980–2010 (1983–2010 for Abuja), are also compared. Overall, the investigation shows a linear relationship between the solar radiation and the induced temperature, thus indicating that the observed variations in the temperature are mainly controlled by the insolation forcing
9.  Kodera et al., 2016       Conclusion:  In summary, diverse aspects of the solar signal on the Earth’s surface can be explained solely by solar UV heating changes in the upper stratosphere which penetrate the troposphere through two pathways: the stratospheric westerly jet in the extratropics, and the stratospheric mean meridional circulation in the tropics, as suggested by Kodera and Kuroda (2002). … [C]entennial-scale solar signals could also be explained by a change in the spectral distribution of solar irradiance, with changes only in the UV part of the solar spectrum, even if the change in total energy was negligibly small.
10.  Hassan et al., 2016       The various techniques have been used to confer the existence of significant relations between the number of Sunspots and different terrestrial climate parameters such as rainfall, temperature, dewdrops, aerosol and ENSO etc.. …This study uses a Markov chain method to find the relations between monthly Sunspots and ENSO data of two epochs (1996–2009 and 1950–2014) …  [P]erfect validation of dependency and stationary tests endorses the applicability of the Markov chain analyses on Sunspots and ENSO data. This shows that a significant relation between Sunspots and ENSO data exists.
11.  Salas et al., 2016        The investigation assesses the influence of recent climatic events in the water resources and the aquifer dynamics in the Huasco watershed by means of the analysis of precipitation, streamflow and piezometric levels during the last 50 years. …  Water reservoirs in the main aquifer (Section III) and in the Santa Juana dam are highly sensitive to ENSO oscillation climatic patterns. … .Spectral analysis identified the presence of a 22.9-year cycle in piezometric levels of the alluvial aquifer of the Huasco River. This cycle is consistent with the 22-year Hale solar cycle, suggesting the existence of a solar forcing controlling the ENSO oscillations.
12.  Nurtaev, 2016         Introduction: Sunspot number time series can be conceived as indicators of climate trends. Extraterrestrial solar-irradiance variations are associated with variations in regional climatology by means of global atmospheric circulation. [S]olar observations over the last century show a long term increase trend of solar activity. During this period also was observed an increase in temperature in the Northern Hemisphere.
13.  Malik and Brönnimann, 2016       We conclude that the positive relation between AISMR [All Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall] and solar activity, as found by other authors, is due to the combined effect of AMO, PDO and multi-decadal ENSO variability on AISMR. The solar activity influences the ICFs [internal climate forcings] and this influence is then transmitted to AISMR. … We also find that there is statistical significant negative relationship between AISMR and ENSO on inter-annual to centennial time scale and the strength of this relationship is modulated by solar activity from 3 to 40 year time scale.
14.  Perone et al., 2016       Evident correlation among solar activity, ENSO effect, tree ring during 20th century … Tree rings reveal climatic variations through years, but also the effect of solar activity in influencing the climate on a large scale. … In the Chilean and Argentinian sites, significant agreement between the time series of tree rings and the 11-year solar cycle was found during the periods of maximum solar activity. Results also showed oscillation with periods of 2–7 years, probably induced by local environmental variations, and possibly also related to the El-Niño events. … These results provided new evidence on the solar activity-climate pattern-tree ring connections over centuries.
15.  Mursula, 2016       Solar mass emission and climate … The new long-term information also allows interesting possibilities to more reliably study the long-term evolution of solar effects in the Earth’s atmosphere and climate. E.g., there is evidence that processes related to HSSs [solar wind streams] may modulate regional/hemispheric climate patterns, in particular the NAO/NAM oscillation. Moreover, other, independent climate effects due to the HMF [heliospheric magnetic field] have been suggested.
16.  Gray et al., 2016       Results from a previous 11-year solar cycle signal study of the period 1870–2010 (140 years; ~13 solar cycles) that suggested a 3–4 year lagged signal in SLP over the Atlantic are confirmed by analysis of a much longer reconstructed dataset for the period 1660–2010 (350 years; ~32 solar cycles). … Corresponding analysis of DJF [December-February]-averaged Atlantic / European blocking frequency shows a highly statistically significant [solar] signal at ~1-year lag that originates primarily from the late winter response. The 11-year solar signal in DJF [December-February] blocking frequency is compared with other known influences from ENSO and the AMO and found to be as large in amplitude and have a larger region of statistical significance.
17.  Zhou et al., 2016       A significant correlation between the solar wind speed (SWS) and sea surface temperature (SST) in the region of the North Atlantic Ocean has been found for the Northern Hemisphere winter from 1963 to 2010, based on 3-month seasonal averages. … SST responds to changes in tropospheric dynamics via wind stress, and to changes in cloud cover affecting the radiative balance. Suggested mechanisms for the solar influence on SST include changes in atmospheric ionization and cloud microphysics affecting cloud cover, storm invigoration, and tropospheric dynamics.  … [D]irect solar inputs, including energetic particles and solar UV, produce stratospheric dynamical changes. Downward propagation of stratospheric dynamical changes eventually further perturbs tropospheric dynamics and SST.
18.  Ball et al., 2016       Solar variability can influence surface climate, for example by affecting the mid-to-high-latitude surface pressure gradient associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation. One key mechanism behind such an influence is the absorption of solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation by ozone in the tropical stratosphere, a process that modifies temperature and wind patterns and hence wave propagation and atmospheric circulation. The amplitude of UV variability is uncertain, yet it directly affects the magnitude of the climate response: observations from the SOlar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE) satellite show broadband changes up to three times larger than previous measurements. 
19.  Tedesco et al., 2016       The surface energy balance and meltwater production of the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) are modulated by snow and ice albedo through the amount of absorbed solar radiation. Here we show, using space-borne multispectral data collected during the 3 decades from 1981 to 2012, that summertime surface albedo over the GrIS decreased at a statistically significant (99 %) rate of 0.02 decade−1 between 1996 and 2012.  … Net solar radiation is the most significant driver of summer surface melt over the GrIS (van den Broeke et al., 2011; Tedesco et al., 2011), and is determined by the combination of the amount of incoming solar radiation and surface albedo. 
20.  Elsharkawy and Elmallah, 2016       [C]ross-correlation and spectral analysis techniques are applied to investigate the influence of terrestrial and extraterrestrial parameters, represented by North Atlantic Oscillations, NAO, and sunspot number, Rz, respectively, upon regional temperature. … Correlation results showed highest influences upon autumn and winter coast temperatures by Rz [sunspot number] and NAO during 1981-2010. … NAO is a potential transmitter of solar forcing as it acts as a mediator between the Sun and Earth’s climate.
21.  Scafetta, 2016       The quasi-secular beat oscillations hindcast reasonably well the known prolonged periods of low solar activity during the last millennium such as the Oort, Wolf, Sporer, Maunder and Dalton minima, as well as the 17 115-year long oscillations found in a detailed temperature reconstruction of the Northern Hemisphere covering the last 2000 years. The millennial cycle hindcasts equivalent solar and climate cycles for 12,000 years. Finally, the harmonic model herein proposed reconstructs the prolonged solar minima that occurred during 1900- 1920 and 1960-1980 and the secular solar maxima around 1870-1890, 1940-1950 and 1995-2005 and a secular upward trending during the 20th century: this modulated trending agrees well with some solar proxy model, with the ACRIM TSI satellite composite and with the global surface temperature modulation since 1850. … [R]esults clearly indicate that both solar and climate oscillations are linked to planetary motion and, furthermore, their timing can be reasonably hindcast and forecast for decades, centuries and millennia.
22.  Czymzik et al., 2016       Flood frequency in both records is significantly correlated to changes in solar activity from the solar Schwabe cycle to multi-centennial oscillations. These significant correlations suggest a solar influence on the frequency of hydroclimate extremes in central Europe. Similar configurations of atmospheric circulation during periods of increased flood frequency and reduced solar activity, as expected to be caused by the so-called solar top-down mechanism by model studies, might indicate that the observed solar activity–flood frequency linkage is related to this feedback. … [N]umerous empirical associations between the activity of the Sun and climate variables like temperature, precipitation, atmospheric circulation and frequency and intensity of hydrometeorological extremes indicate a solar influence on climate on regional scales (Adolphi et al., 2014; Bond et al., 2001; Fleitmann et al., 2003; Gray et al., 2010; Lockwood, 2012; Wirth et al., 2013).
23.  Serykh and Sonechkin, 2016       Basing on a mathematical idea about the so-called strange nonchaotic attractor (SNA) in the quasi-periodically forced dynamical systems, the currently available re-analyses data are considered. It is found that the El Niño – Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is driven not only by the seasonal heating, but also by three more external periodicities (incommensurate to the annual period) associated with the ~18.6-year lunar-solar nutation of the Earth rotation axis, ~11-year sunspot activity cycle and the ~14-month Chandler wobble in the Earth’s pole motion.
24.  Gopalswamy, 2016       Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are relatively a recently discovered phenomenon—in 1971, some 15 years into the Space Era. It took another two decades to realize that CMEs are the most important players in solar terrestrial relationship as the root cause of severe weather in Earth’s space environment.
25.  Bronck and Sirocko, 2016       The statistical analysis of all 92 historical freezing events showed that 80 events occurred during a negative NAO winter phase. The bootstrap test defined the results as extremely significant. To understand the climatic forcing behind the freezing chronology the NAO data set was smoothed by a three point running mean filter and compared with the 11- year cyclicity of the sunspot numbers. A complete NAO cycle can be observed within each solar cycle back to 1960 and from 1820 to 1900….[T]he 11 year solar periodicity is related to various parts of the Earth/Ocean/Atmosphere system and not only to the stratospheric signal. However, the NAO is the dominating mediator to implement a solar component into the European winter extremes.
26.  Scafetta, 2016       This study investigates the existence of a multi-frequency spectral coherence between planetary and global surface temperature oscillations by using advanced techniques of coherence analysis and statistical significance tests. … [U]sing the canonical coordinates analysis at least five coherent frequencies at the 95% significance level are found at the following periods: 6.6, 7.4, 14, 20 and 60 years. Thus, high resolution coherence analysis confirms that the climate system can be partially modulated by astronomical forces of gravitational, electromagnetic and solar origin. … Numerous evidences for a solar influence on the climate at multiple scales are also well-known (e.g.: Hoyt and Schatten, 1997). More recently, several authors have advocated a planetary theory of solar and climate oscillations on shorter scales (e.g.: Abreu et al., 2012, Charvátová, 2009, Cionco and Soon, 2015, Hung, 2007, Jakubcová and Pick, 1986, Jose, 1965, McCracken et al., 2013, McCracken et al., 2014, Mörner et al., 2013, Mörner, 2015, Puetz et al., 2014, Salvador, 2013, Solheim, 2013, Tan and Cheng, 2013, Tattersall, 2013 and Wilson, 2013) … A coupling between planetary oscillations and climate change must necessarily involve a complex and long chain of physical mechanisms that are being investigated in the scientific literature.  … Finally, an astronomically induced albedo variation could easily induce climatic variations. In fact, if the Earth’s albedo oscillates by just a few percent driven by astronomical forcings, the resulting oscillations would be sufficient to induce the observed climatic oscillations because these are of the order of a fraction of Celsius degree.
27.  Martínez-Asensio et al., 2016       Autumn sea level extremes vary with the 11-year solar cycle at Venice as suggested by previous studies but a similar link is also found at Trieste. In addition, a solar signal in winter sea level extremes is also found at Venice, Trieste, Marseille, Ceuta, Brest and Newlyn. The influence of the solar cycle is also evident in the sea level extremes derived from a barotropic model with spatial patterns that are consistent with the correlations obtained at the tide gauges. This agreement indicates that the link to the solar cycle is through modulation of the atmospheric forcing.
28.  Weißbach et al., 2016       Compared to single records, this stack represents the mean δ18O signal for northern Greenland that is interpreted as proxy for temperature. Our northern Greenland δ18O stack indicates distinctly enriched [warm] δ18O values during medieval times, about AD 1420 ± 20 and from AD 1870 onwards. The period between AD 1420 and AD 1850 has depleted [cold] δ18O values compared to the average for the entire millennium and represents the Little Ice Age. The δ18O values of the 20th century are comparable to the medieval period but are lower than that about AD 1420.  …. The solar activity and internal Arctic climate dynamics are likely the main factors influencing the temperature in northern Greenland.
29.  Svensmark et al., 2016 [press release]       Solar activity has a direct impact on the Earth’s cloud cover … The solar eruptions are known to shield Earth’s atmosphere from cosmic rays. However the new study, published in Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics, shows that the global cloud cover is simultaneously reduced, supporting the idea that cosmic rays are important for cloud formation. The eruptions cause a reduction in cloud fraction of about 2 percent corresponding to roughly a billion tonnes of liquid water disappearing from the atmosphere.  Since clouds are known to affect global temperatures on longer timescales, the present investigation represents an important step in the understanding of clouds and climate variability.
“Earth is under constant bombardment by particles from space called galactic cosmic rays. Violent eruptions at the Sun’s surface can blow these cosmic rays away from Earth for about a week. Our study has shown that when the cosmic rays are reduced in this way there is a corresponding reduction in Earth’s cloud cover. Since clouds are an important factor in controlling the temperature on Earth our results may have implications for climate change,” explains lead author on the study Jacob Svensmark of DTU. … The effect from Forbush decreases on clouds is too brief to have any impact on long-term temperature changes. However, since clouds are affected by short term changes in galactic cosmic radiation, they may well also be affected by the slower change in Solar activity that happens on scales from tens to hundreds of years, and thus play a role in the radiation budget that determines the global temperature.  The Sun’s contribution to past and future climate change may thus be larger than merely the direct changes in radiation, concludes the scientists behind the new study.
30.  Lenz et al., 2016       Two palynological analyses of 6.3 and 70 kyr long records with a temporal resolution of 70 and 700 years respectively confirm vegetation and climate variability in the sub-Milankovitch range. This variability clearly corresponds to cyclic climate fluctuations indicating the influence of solar activity and a millennial-scale variability of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation also seen during the Quaternary icehouse system. 
31.  Haig and Nott, 2016       The development of a new tropical cyclone activity index spanning the last 1500 years has enabled the examination of tropical cyclone climatology at higher temporal resolution than was previously possible. Here we show that in addition to other well-known climate indices, solar forcing largely drives decadal, interdecadal, and centennial cycles within the tropical cyclone record.
32.  Arsenovic et al., 2016       We investigate the influence of Middle Range Energy Electrons (MEE; typically 30-300 keV) precipitation on the atmosphere using the SOCOL3-MPIOM chemistry-climate model with coupled ocean. … Results show that during geomagnetically active periods MEE [Middle Range Energy Electrons] significantly increase the amount of NOy and HOx in the polar winter mesosphere, in addition to other particles and sources, resulting in local ozone decreases of up to 35%. These changes are followed by an intensification of the polar night jet, as well as mesospheric warming and stratospheric cooling. … A surface air temperature response is detected in several regions, with the most pronounced warming occurring in the Antarctic during austral winter. Surface warming of up to 2 K is also seen over continental Asia during boreal winter.
33.  Wang et al., 2016       The broad comparability between the HML paleo-proxies, Chinese speleothem δ18Orecords, and the northern hemisphere summer insolation throughout the Holocene, suggests that solar insolation exerts a profound influence on ASM [Asian summer monsoon] changes. These findings reinforce a model of combined insolation and glacial forcing of the ASM.
34.  Huo and Xiao, 2016       The impact of solar activity on the 2015/16 El Niño event … Recent SST and atmospheric circulation anomaly data suggest that the 2015/16 El Niño event is quickly decaying. Some researchers have predicted a forthcoming La Niña event in late summer or early fall 2016. From the perspective of the modulation of tropical SST by solar activity, the authors studied the evolution of the 2015/16 El Niño event, which occurred right after the 2014 solar peak year. Based on statistical and composite analysis, a significant positive correlation was found between sunspot number index and El Niño Modoki index, with a lag of two years. A clear evolution of El Niño Modoki events was found within 1–3 years following each solar peak year during the past 126 years, suggesting that anomalously strong solar activity during solar peak periods favors the triggering of an El Niño Modoki event. The patterns of seasonal mean SST and wind anomalies since 2014 are more like a mixture of two types of El Niño (i.e., eastern Pacific El Niño and El Niño Modoki), which is similar to the pattern modulated by solar activity during the years following a solar peak. Therefore, the El Niño Modoki component in the 2015/16 El Niño event may be a consequence of solar activity, which probably will not decay as quickly as the eastern Pacific El Niño component. The positive SST anomaly will probably sustain in the central equatorial Pacific (around the dateline) and the northeastern Pacific along the coast of North America, with a low-intensity level, during the second half of 2016.
35.  Wahab et al., 2016       Understanding the influence of solar variability on the Earth’s climate requires knowledge of solar variability, solar interactions, and the mechanisms explain the response of the Earth’s climate system. The NAO (North Atlantic oscillation) is one of the most dominant modes of global climate variability. Like El Niño, La Niña, and the Southern Oscillation, it is considered as free internal oscillation of the climate system not subjected to external forcing. It is shown, to be linked to energetic solar eruptions. Surprisingly, it turns out that features of solar activity have been related to El Niño and La Niña, also have an significant impact on the NAO. The climate of the Atlantic sector exhibits considerable variability on a wide range of time scales. A substantial portion is associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), a hemispheric meridional oscillation as atmospheric mass with centers of action near Iceland and over the subtropical Atlantic. NAO- has a related impacts on winter climate extend from Florida to Greenland and from northwestern Africa over Europe far into northern Asian region. In the present work solar cycle 22 was implemented via sun spots number and area and there interrelationship with NAO index and discussed their dependency which consequently that could be used to predict the behavior of NAO index in the next solar cycle as an indicator to climatic variability.
36.  Veretenenko and Ogurtsov, 2016       In this work we study links between low cloud anomalies (LCA) at middle latitudes of the Northern and Southern hemispheres and galactic cosmic ray (GCR) variations used as a proxy of solar variability on the decadal time scale. It was shown that these links are not direct, but realized through GCR/solar activity phenomena influence on the development of extratropical baric systems (cyclones and troughs) which form cloud field.
37.  Scafetta et al., 2016       Indeed, many other stable orbital resonance frequencies (e.g. at periods of 20 years, 45 years, 60 years, 85 years, 159–171–185 years) are found in radionucleotide, solar, aurora and climate records, as determined in the scientific literature. Thus, the result supports a planetary theory of solar and/or climate variation that has recently received a renewed attention. In our particular case, the rhythmic contraction and expansion of the solar system driven by a major resonance involving the movements of the four Jovian planets appear to work as a gravitational/electromagnetic pump that increases and decreases the cosmic ray and dust densities inside the inner region of the solar system, which then modulate both the radionucleotide production and climate change by means of a cloud/albedo modulation.
38.  Turney et al., 2016       Southern Hemisphere westerly airflow has a significant influence on the ocean–atmosphere system [“precipitation, sea ice extent, sea surface temperatures and the carbon cycle”] of the mid- to high latitudes with potentially global climate implications. … Spectral analysis of the charcoal record identifies a pervasive ca. 250-year periodicity that is coherent with radiocarbon production rates, suggesting that solar variability has a modulating influence on Southern Hemisphere westerly airflow. 
39.  Baker, 2016       For solar measurements, the first four rows of the matrix predict at least 98% of the top hundred significant periodicities determined from multi-taper spectral analysis of solar data sets (the satellite ACRIM composite irradiance; the terrestrial 10.7cm Penticton Adjusted Daily Radio Flux, Series D; and the historical mean monthly International Sunspot Number). At centennial and millennial time scales, the same matrix predicts ‘average’ significant periodicities (greater than 95%) reported in 23 published climate data sets. This discovery suggests there is strong empirical evidence for a d-cyclic fractional ‘solar clock’, where the corresponding spectrum of cycles and switching events are embedded into the historical, climatic and geological records of the Earth.
40.  Liu et al., 2016       Significant relationships were found between our PDSI [Palmer Drought Severity Index] reconstruction and the solar radiation cycle and the sun spot cycle, North Atlantic Oscillation, the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, as well as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation.
41.  Engels et al., 2016       Increasing precipitation amounts around 2800 cal. yr BP resulted in a lake-level rise of about 3.5–4 m to levels that were 1–1.5 m higher than at present, in line with increased precipitation levels as inferred for the 2.8-kyr event from nearby raised bog areas as well as with reconstructions of higher lake levels in the French Alps, all of which have been previously attributed to a phase of decreased solar activity.
42.  Chen et al., 2016       This reconstruction successfully captured the wetting trend that occurred from the 1980s to the 2000s and generally agreed with dry periods previously estimated from tree-ring records obtained from the surrounding areas. Moreover, a wavelet coherence analysis shows that significant common oscillations (11.5 and 60 yr) have occurred and suggests that precipitation variations across the Urumqi region were related to different climatic forcing mechanisms (i.e. solar activities and the NAO).
43.  Luoto and Nevalainen, 2016       Solar and atmospheric forcing on mountain lakes … The influence of NAO and solar forcing on aquatic invertebrates was also significant in the lakes except in the less transparent lake known to have remained uniformly cold during the past centuries due to summertime snowmelt input. The results suggest that external forcing plays an important role in these pristine ecosystems through their impacts on limnology of the lakes. Not only does the air temperature variability influence the communities but also larger-scale external factors related to atmospheric circulation patterns and solar activity cause long-term changes in high-altitude aquatic ecosystems, through their connections to hydroclimatic conditions and light environment. These findings are important in the assessment of climate change impacts on aquatic ecosystems and in greater understanding of the consequences of external forcing on lake ontogeny.
44.  Jin et al., 2016       Our record provides further evidence for the complex relationship of insolation [surface solar radiation]-induced temperature, evaporation, and precipitation affecting the regional climate changes on the Tibetan Plateau.
45.  Roy, 2016       This work studies the role of natural factors mainly solar eleven-year cycle variability, and volcanic eruptions on two major modes of climate variability the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) for around last 150 years period. The NAO is the primary factor to regulate Central England Temperature (CET) during winter throughout the period, though NAO is impacted differently by other factors in different time periods. Solar variability has a positive influence on NAO during 1978-1997, which is opposite before that period. Solar NAO lag relationship is also sensitive to the chosen times of reference. Such analyses raise a question about previously proposed mechanism and relationship related to the sun and NAO. The ENSO is seen to be influenced strongly by solar variability and volcanic eruptions in certain periods.
46.  Jansen et al., 2016       [W]e suggest that deviations in ELA [equilibrium line altitude] fluctuations between Scandinavian maritime and continental glaciers around 7150, 6560, 6000, 5150, 3200 and 2200 cal. yr BP reflect the different response of continental and maritime glaciers to drops in total solar irradiance (TSI).
47.  Czymzik et al., 2016       Calcite layer thickness oscillations of about 88 and 208 years resemble the solar Gleissberg and Suess cycles suggesting that the recorded hydroclimate changes in north-eastern Germany are modified by solar influences on synoptic-scale atmospheric circulation.
48.  Nagai et al., 2016       The multi-millennial variability recorded in both cores suggests the occurrence of Holocene in-phase climatic changes both in Southern Hemisphere at the latitudes of the SW coast of Brazil (Cabo Frio region) and in the Northern Hemisphere, at the latitude of Galicia (NW Iberian Margin). These coupled climatic alterations were probably related to changes in the oceanic-atmospheric climatic systems, coupled with and amplified by solar forcing effects.
49.  Zhang et al., 2016       Our results reveal a persistent wetting trend in northwestern China in winter throughout the Holocene, which is in response to winter insolation [surface solar radiation] at mid-northern latitudes. Winter insolation [surface solar radiation] can influence the rainfall via three ways. First, increasing latitudinal gradient of the incoming solar insolation at mid-latitudes strengthens the westerly intensity. Second, the evaporation is enhanced because of insolation-induced winter temperature rising, resulting in an increase in the air humidity. Intensified westerly winds and the increased water vapour together are conductive to enhance moisture transport towards northwestern China and thus increase winter precipitation in this area. Third, the increasing trend of winter insolation [surface solar radiation] weakens the East Asian winter monsoon, which is favourable for the formation of rainfall via crippling the Siberian High that is beneficial for atmospheric lifting motion.
50.  Kuroda, 2016       Climate is known to be affected by various factors, including oceanic changes and volcanic eruptions. 11-year solar cycle change is one of such important factors. Observational analysis shows that the winter-mean North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and late-winter/spring Southern Annular Mode (SAM) show structural modulation associated with 11-year solar cycle. In fact, these signals tend to extend from surface to upper stratosphere and persistent longer period only in the High Solar (HS) years.
51.  Schulte et al., 2016       Comparing the sedimentary flood proxies from the basins analysed and the Summer NAO index from 1670 to 2000, severe floods occurred mostly during positive SNAO modes. This result is supported by our findings regarding the influence of low-frequency atmospheric circulation pattern on summer floods in Switzerland (1800-2008). Thus, the mechanisms of flood processes from the different catchments are strongly influenced by North Atlantic dynamics and solar forcing.
52.  Sánchez et al., 2016       Peatland dynamics seems to have been coupled to changes in solar irradiance and hydrological conditions. Our results point to wetter conditions after the mid-16th century, although with high intra-annual fluctuations. At the late 18th century, when solar activity was systematically higher than before, peat carbon accumulation rates (PCAR) showed a continuous increase and the humification indices suggest a change towards more humified peat.
53.  Kodera et al., 2016       The solar signal in the annual mean surface temperature is characterized by (i) mid-latitude warming and (ii) no overall tropical warming. The mid-latitude warming during solar maxima in both hemispheres is associated with a downward penetration of zonal mean zonal wind anomalies from the upper stratosphere during late winter. During the Northern Hemisphere winter this is manifested by a modulation of the polar-night jet, whereas in the Southern Hemisphere, the upper stratospheric subtropical jet plays the major role. Warming signals are particularly apparent over the Eurasian continent and ocean frontal zones, including a previously reported lagged response over the North Atlantic. In the tropics, local warming occurs over the Indian and central Pacific oceans during high solar activity. …. These experiments support earlier evidence of an indirect solar influence [on surface temperatures] from the stratosphere.
54.  Berger et al., 2016       This multi-proxy study of a small floodplain in the Rhone catchment area, at the northern edge of the Mediterranean morphoclimatic system, provides valuable information concerning the impact of mid-Holocene climate variability (8.5–7.0 ka) and the effects of two rapid climatic changes (8.2 and 7.7/7.1 ka) on an alluvial plain, its basin and the first farming societies of the Rhone valley. Around 7.7/7.1 ka [7,700/7,100 years ago], the combined effects of (1) a strong rate of change in insolation and (2) variations in solar activity amplified marine and atmospheric circulation in the north-west Atlantic (Bond event 5b), which imply continental hydrological, soil and vegetation changes in the small catchment area.
55.  Zhang and Jin, 2016       This paper provides another look at the response of the Asian summer monsoon (ASM) to insolation forcing and oceanic feedback during the Holocene, using a fully coupled general circulation ocean–atmosphere model forced by Earth’s orbital variations. The model results revealed a recurrent circumglobal teleconnection (CGT) pattern in the summertime (June–July–August) mid-latitude circulation of the Northern Hemisphere during the Holocene. The CGT [circumglobal teleconnection] index showed a decreasing trend before ~5 ka BP and a slight increasing trend afterwards, affected by the combined effects of summer insolation, Indian summer monsoon (ISM), North Atlantic and Indian Ocean–western Pacific Ocean sea surface temperature (SST). The CGT showed a close relationship with ASM precipitation and surface air temperature during the Holocene and, therefore, could act as a bridge linking the ASM to insolation, high-latitude forcing (North Atlantic SST), and low-latitude forcing (tropical Ocean SST).
56.  Zhu et al., 2016       We identified four major cold periods (1839–1846, 1884–1901, 1906–1908 and 1941–1958) and three major warm periods (1855–1880, 1918–1932 and 1998–2013) in the past 211 years. The multi-taper method spectral analysis revealed significant cycles at 48.8, 11.5, 8.9, 3.9, 3.5 and 2–3 years, which might be associated with global climate oscillations and land-sea thermal contrasts, such as the sea surface temperatures, El Niño-Southern Oscillation, Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and solar activity.
57.  Wang et al., 2016       Tree-ring-based reconstruction of temperature variability (1445–2011) for the upper reaches of the Heihe River Basin, Northwest China … Spectral analyses suggested that the reconstructed annual mean temperature variation may be related to large-scale atmospheric–oceanic variability such as the solar activity, Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO).
58.  Al-Tameemi and Chukin, 2016       Highlights: Strong correlation between solar activity and the global evaporation rate is detected. … The water cycle is the most active and most important component in the circulation of global mass and energy in the Earth system. Furthermore, water cycle parameters such as evaporation, precipitation, and precipitable water vapour play a major role in global climate change. In this work, we attempt to determine the impact of solar activity on the global water cycle by analyzing the global monthly values of precipitable water vapour, precipitation, and the Solar Modulation Potential in 1983–2008. … The results showed that there is a relationship between the solar modulation potential and evaporation values for the period of study. Therefore, we can assume that the solar activity has an impact on the global water cycle.
59.  Ogurtsov et al., 2016       Five proxy temperature time series based on tree-rings and varves from the middle and high latitudes (φ > 50°) of North America were analyzed. They cover the last 3–5 centuries. It was shown that the reconstructions from Canadian Rockies (52.15° N, 117.15° W) and northeast Alaska (68.8° N, 142.3° W) correlate appreciably with Wolf [sunspot] number and 10Be concentration in Greenland ice over long (T > 13 years) time scales.
60.  Xiao et al., 2016       The impact of solar activity on tropical Pacific convection during the boreal summer (June-July-August, JJA) has been examined using reanalysis data, revealing a significant lagged (1–2 years) correlation between outgoing long-wave radiation (OLR) over the tropical western Pacific and the F10.7 index. The OLR anomaly over the tropical western Pacific and the maritime continent shows a dipole pattern during the 1–2 years following high solar (HS) years. … By modulating vertical air temperature, the solar signal in the tropical sea surface temperature (SST) may contribute to the triggering of a lagged convection dipole pattern.
61.  Bernal et al., 2016       [A]tmospheric circulation over South America and monsoon intensity have been tightly correlated throughout most of the Holocene, both directly responding to solar precession. … We also detect periods where rainfall amount in northeastern and southeastern Brazil are markedly anti-phased, suggesting a north-south migration of SACZ, which it appears to be mediated by solar irradiance. 
62.  Pedersen et al., 2016       The last interglacial, the Eemian, was characterized by higher than present temperatures in the Arctic region driven by increased summertime insolation [surface solar radiation] at high northern latitudes (CAPE-Last Interglacial Project Members, 2006; MassonDelmotte et al., 2013). The recent NEEM ice core from northwestern Greenland covers the last interglacial period and indicates substantial warming from 129 to 114 thousand years before present (ka) peaking at 8 ± 4 K above the mean of the last millennium. … During the Eemian, the global sea level was increased 6–9 m above present (Dutton and Lambeck, 2012; Dutton et al., 2015; Kopp et al., 2009), indicating a substantial reduction in the continental ice sheets. … [T]he insolation appears to be the dominant cause of the expected ice sheet reduction.
63.  Bügelmayer-Blaschek et al., 2016       We performed 19 experiments that differ in the applied forcings (TSI [total solar irradiance], volcanic) and the initial atmospheric conditions. … The fact that also model runs that are not forced with TSI [total solar irradiance] variations display an 80 year time lag indicates that the relationship between TSI [total solar irradiance] and IMF [iceberg melt flux] is due to internal dynamics of the coupled system. From our experiments we conclude that internal ice sheet variability seems to be the source of the multi-century and millennial-scale iceberg events during the Holocene.
64.  Cullens et al., 2016       Simulations under both time-varying and fixed-solar inputs show statistically significant responses in temperatures and winds in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) during austral winter and spring. At solar maximum, the monthly-mean, zonal-mean temperature in the SH from July to October is cooler (~1 – 3 K) in the stratosphere and warmer (~1 – 4 K) in the mesosphere and the lower thermosphere (MLT). In solar maximum years, the SH polar vortex is more stable and its eastward speed is about 5 – 8 m s-1 greater than during solar minimum. The increase in the eastward wind propagates downward and poleward from July to October in the SH. Because of increase in the eastward wind, the propagation of eastward gravity waves to the MLT is reduced. This results in a net westward response in gravity wave drag, peaking at ~10 m s-1 day-1 in the SH high-latitude MLT. These changes in gravity wave drag modify the wave-induced residual circulation, and this contributes to the warming of ~1 – 4 K in the MLT.
65.  Cabedo-Sanz et al., 2016       Highlights: Periodicities in drift ice potentially associated with volcanic and solar forcing … Abstract: The early mid Holocene (ca 8–6.2 cal ka BP) was characterized by relatively low or absent drift ice, low primary productivity and relatively high SSTs.
66.  Kawahata et al., 2016       A long-term trend of declining SSTs can be attributed mainly to changes in solar radiation and sea level and, to a lesser extent, changes in the Asian monsoon. … During the last three millennia, the SSTs (ATs) fluctuated by 2.1 °C, with a maximum in 820 AD (24.3 °C [25.9 °C]) and two minima in 760 BC (22.2 °C [23.8 °C]) and 990 AD (22.4 °C [24.0 °C]). … These temperature fluctuations cannot be explained by a single cause but rather by more than one external and internal driver of climate variability (e.g., volcanic forcing, ocean-atmosphere interactions, and solar forcing).
67.  Incarbona et al., 2016       Comparison between the records and multi-decadal atmospheric circulation paterns and climatic external forcings indicates that Mediterranean circulation destabilisation occurs during positive North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and negative Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) phases, reduced solar activity and strong tropical volcanic eruptions. … Thermohaline circulation destabilisations in the Mediterranean circulation also seem to be linked to reduced solar activity and to frequent volcanic eruptions. Solar activity modulates patterns in surface temperature and pressure that resemble NAO phases, through dynamical coupling processes between the stratosphere and the troposphere that transmit the solar signal to the Earth’s surface. The increase in sulphur aerosols from tropical volcanic emissions produces stratospheric and surface conditions that resemble the positive NAO phase and cause decrease in oceanic heat content, with long-lived temperature anomalies extending to the mid-depth and deep ocean…
68.  Tang et al., 2016       The thermal structure and energy balance of upper atmosphere are dominated by solar activity. … [T]he results show that the global T-CPM [Temperature of Cold-Point-Mesopause] is significantly correlated to solar activity at the 0.05 level of significance with correlation coefficient of 0.90. … The co-relationship analysis shows that the T-CPM is significantly correlated to solar activity at the 0.05 level of significance for each latitude zone. The correlation coefficients at middle latitude regions are higher than those of equator and high latitude regions, and the global distribution takes on M-shape.
69.  Sunkara and Tiwari, 2016       To study the imprints of the solar–ENSO–geomagnetic activity on the Indian subcontinent, we have applied singular spectral analysis (SSA) and wavelet analysis to the tree-ring temperature variability record from the Western Himalayas. Other data used in the present study are the solar sunspot number (SSN), geomagnetic indices (aa index), and the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) for the common time period of 1876–2000. Both SSA and wavelet spectral analyses reveal the presence of 5–7-year short-term ENSO variations and the 11-year solar cycle, indicating the possible combined influences of solar–geomagnetic activities and ENSO on the Indian temperature. Another prominent signal corresponding to 33-year periodicity in the tree-ring record suggests the Sun-temperature variability link probably induced by changes in the basic state of the Earth’s atmosphere. In order to complement the above findings, we performed a wavelet analysis of SSA reconstructed time series, which agrees well with our earlier results and increases the signal-to-noise ratio, thereby showing the strong influence of solar–geomagnetic activity and ENSO throughout the entire period. … The present analyses suggest that the influence of solar activities on the Indian temperature variability operates in part indirectly through coupling of ENSO on multilateral timescales. 
70.  Usoskin et al., 2016      The corrected series is provided as supplementary material in electronic form and displays secular minima around 1800 (Dalton Minimum) and 1900 (Gleissberg Minimum), as well as the Modern Grand Maximum of activity in the second half of the twentieth century. The uniqueness of the grand maximum is confirmed for the last 250 years. 
71.  Sha et al., 2016       Solar forcing as an important trigger for West Greenland sea-ice variability over the last millennium … Here, we use diatom assemblages from a marine sediment core collected from the West Greenland shelf to reconstruct changes in sea-ice cover over the last millennium. The proxy-based reconstruction demonstrates a generally strong link between changes in sea-ice cover and solar variability during the last millennium. Weaker (or stronger) solar forcing may result in the increase (or decrease) in sea-ice cover west of Greenland. In addition, model simulations show that variations in solar activity not only affect local sea-ice formation, but also control the sea-ice transport from the Arctic Ocean through a sea-ice–ocean–atmosphere feedback mechanism.
72.  Muthers et al., 2016       The influence of reduced solar forcing (grand solar minimum or geoengineering scenarios like solar radiation management) on the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) is assessed in an ensemble of atmosphere-oceanchemistry-climate model simulations. Ensemble sensitivity simulations are performed with and without interactive chemistry. Without chemistry-climate interaction the AMOC is intensified in the course of the solar radiation reduction (SRR), which is attributed to the thermal effect of the solar forcing: reduced sea surface temperatures and enhanced sea ice formation increase the density of the upper ocean in the North Atlantic and intensify the deepwater formation. In simulations with chemistry-climate interactions a second, dynamical effect on the AMOC is identified which counteracts the thermal effect. This dynamical mechanism is driven by the stratospheric cooling in response to the reduced solar forcing, which is strongest in the tropics and leads to a weakening of the Northern polar vortex.
73.  Roy et al., 2016      Introduction: Observational studies have suggested a significant solar related impact on sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific (van Loon et al., 2007, Meehl et al., 2008), tropical circulations (Haigh et al., 2005, Meehl et al., 2008), climatological precipitation maxima in the tropics (van Loon et al., 2004), Northern Hemisphere winter blocking (Barriopedro et al., 2008; Lockwood et al., 2010), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) (Lockwood et al., 2010, Maliniemi et al., 2013, 2014), Northern Annular Mode (NAM) (Ogi et al., 2004) and Antarctic polar vortex (Haigh and Roscoe, 2009).
74.  Agnihotri, 2016       Summary and Recommendations: With increasing evidences from both continental (such as aforementioned examples of climate manifestations) as well as oceanic repositories [Agnihotri et al., 2002 & 2008; Kurian et al., 2009] from both hemispheres (i.e. northern as well as southern hemispheres), it is becoming clear that variations in Sun’s energy output despite being quantitatively very minute, appears to be capable of influencing terrestrial climate on decadal to centennial timescales, most likely due to involvement of certain key ocean-atmospheric feedback processes [Agnihotri & Dutta, 2003; Kodera, 2004; Ruzmaikin, 2007]. Exact causal mechanism(s) involved and necessary amplifying agents are still to be identified and understood in order to quantify role of this external forcing of climate.
75.  Eicher, 2016       Climatic and insolation [surface solar radiation]  control on the high-resolution total air content in the NGRIP ice core … Here we present a highresolution TAC record over the whole North Greenland Ice Core Project ice core, covering the last 120 000 years, which independently supports an insolation signature in Greenland. Wavelet analysis reveals a clear precession and obliquity signal similar to previous findings on Antarctic TAC, with a different insolation history.
76.  Sen and Ogrin, 2016       This paper investigates the monthly, winter, and annual temperature time series obtained from the instrumental records in Zagreb, Croatia, for the period 1864–2010. Using wavelet analysis, the dominant modes of variability in these temperature series are identified, and the time intervals over which these modes may persist are delineated.  The results reveal that all three temperature records exhibit low frequency variability with a dominant periodicity at around 7.7 years. The 7.7-year cycle has also been observed in the temperature data recorded at several other stations in Europe, especially in Northern and Western Europe, and may be linked to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and/or solar/geomagnetic activity.                     
77.  Maruyama, 2016       The interest in the relation between the solar activity and climate change is increasing. As for the solar activity, a fractal property of the sunspot series was studied by many works. In general, a fractal property was observed in the time series of dynamics of complex systems. The purposes of this study were to investigate the relationship between the sunspot number, solar radio flux at 10.7 cm (F10.7 cm) and total ozone from a view of multifractality. … The influence of the solar activity on the total ozone was shown by the wavelet coherence, phase and the similarity of the change of fractality. These findings will contribute to the research of the relationship between the solar activity and climate.
78.  Poulos, 2016       The physical mechanism proposed is that planetary gravitational forces drive solar activity that in turn drives temperature variations in earth. The sun is in a boundary balance state at one hand collapsing due to gravity and at the other hand expanding due to fusion, and as such it should be heavily influenced by minimal external forcings such as planetary gravity. Sound waves in the solar mass, created from the planetary movement, are responsible for the formation of solar corona and sun spots. The Earth-Venus 251 year resonance is resonant to a near surface solar layer’s thermal natural frequency that “explodes” to form solar wind. The calculated solar wind properties match the observed.
79.  Maliniemi, 2016       Observations of solar wind related climate effects in the Northern Hemisphere winter … Recent results, both observational and from chemistry climate models, have indicated significant effects in the Earth’s middle atmosphere due to the energetic electrons precipitating from the magnetosphere. These effects include the formation of reactive hydrogen and nitrogen oxides in the high latitude mesosphere and the depletion of ozone caused by them. Ozone is a radiatively active and important gas, which affects the thermal structure and dynamics of the middle atmosphere. Accordingly, the depletion of ozone can intensify the large scale stratospheric circulation pattern called the polar vortex. Winter weather conditions on the surface have been shown to be dependent on the polar vortex strength. … A comprehensive knowledge of the Earth’s climate system and all its drivers is crucial for the future projection of climate. Solar variability effects have been estimated to produce only a small factor to the global climate change. However, there is increasing evidence, including the results presented in this thesis, that the different forms of solar variability can have a substantial effect to regional and seasonal climate variability. With this new evidence, the solar wind related particle effects in the atmosphere are now gaining increasing attention. These effects will soon be included in the next coupled model inter comparison project (CMIP6) as an additional solar related climate effect.
80.  Muthers et al., 2016       The influence of reduced solar forcing (grand solar minimum or geoengineering scenarios like solar radiation management) on the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is assessed in an ensemble of atmosphere–ocean–chemistry–climate model simulations. Ensemble sensitivity simulations are performed with and without interactive chemistry. In both experiments the AMOC is intensified in the course of the solar radiation reduction, which is attributed to the thermal effect of the solar forcing: reduced sea surface temperatures and enhanced sea ice formation increase the density of the upper ocean in the North Atlantic and intensify the deepwater formation. Furthermore, a second, dynamical effect on the AMOC is identified driven by the stratospheric cooling in response to the reduced solar forcing.
Warming Trend Since 1980s Explained By Surface Solar Radiation (Cloud Cover Reduction)
81. Sanchez-Lorenzo et al., 2016       The linear trend in the mean annual series of global solar radiation shows a significant increase since the 1980s of around 10 Wm-2 over the whole 32-year study period. Similar significant increases are observed in the mean seasonal series, with the highest rate of absolute (relative) change during summer (autumn). These results are in line with the widespread increase of global solar radiation, also known as the brightening period, reported at many worldwide observation sites (e.g. Wild, 2009; Sanchez-Lorenzo et al., 2013b). … Summarizing, all these results point towards a diminution of clouds and/or aerosols in Spain since the 1980s.
82.  Kambezidis et al., 2016      [T]his work investigates the evolution and trends in the surface net short-wave radiation (NSWR, surface solar radiation – reflected) over the Mediterranean Basin during the period 1979 − 2012 using monthly re-analysis datasets from the Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) and aims to shed light on the specific role of clouds on the NSWR trends. The solar dimming/brightening phenomenon is temporally and spatially analyzed over the Mediterranean Basin. The spatially-averaged NSWR over the whole Mediterranean Basin was found to increase in MERRA by +0.36 Wm−2 per decade, with higher rates over the western Mediterranean (+0.82 Wm−2 per decade), and especially during spring (March-April-May; +1.3 Wm−2 per decade). … The increasing trends in NSWR are mostly associated with decreasing ones in cloud optical depth (COD), especially for the low (<700 hPa) clouds. The decreasing COD trends (less opaque clouds and/or decrease in absolute cloudiness) are more pronounced during spring, thus controlling the increasing tendency in NSWR.
83.  Calbó et al., 2016       The present paper describes how the entire series of global solar radiation (1987–2014) and diffuse radiation (1994–2014) were built, including the quality control process. Appropriate corrections to the diffuse component were made when a shadowband was employed to make measurements. Analysis of the series reveals that annual mean global irradiance presents a statistically significant increase of 2.5 W m−2 (1.4 %) decade−1 (1988–2014 period), mainly due to what occurs in summer (5.6 W m−2 decade−1). These results constitute the first assessment of solar radiation trends for the northeastern region of the Iberian Peninsula and are consistent with trends observed in the regional surroundings and also by satellite platforms, in agreement with the global brightening phenomenon. Diffuse radiation has decreased at −1.3 W m−2 (−2 %) decade−1 (1994–2014 period), which is a further indication of the reduced cloudiness and/or aerosol load causing the changes.
Periods With Low Solar Activity (Little Ice Age) Correlate With Cooling; Periods With High Solar Activity (Modern, Medieval Solar Maximum) Correlate With Warming
84.  Andres, 2016       Reconstructions of historical climate changes indicate that surface air temperatures decreased over the preindustrial last millennium. Conflicting explanations have been proposed for the cause of the transition from the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) in the early part of the last millennium to the Little Ice Age (LIA) near its end. The possible causes include volcanic emissions, total solar irradiance (TSI) variations, greenhouse gas concentration fluctuations and orbital forcing variations. In the present paper, we demonstrate that all of these climate forcings contribute significantly to simulated surface air temperature and sea ice concentration changes over this period. On the other hand, simulated ocean heat content appears to respond significantly only to volcanic and TSI [total solar irradiance] variations.   In simulations at T85 resolution, TSI [total solar irradiance] reductions and volcanic emissions together generate significant increases in sea ice extent in the Barents Sea, which we find to be responsible for most of the temperature reductions over north-western Europe.
85.  Xing et al., 2016       The comparison between MDVM reconstructed temperature and the variation of external forcing (solar activity and volcanic activity) is shown in Fig. 5. The smoothed MDVM reconstruction exhibited a general agreement with the variation of the reconstructed total solar irradiance (TSI), and the correlation between the two series during the common period 849–2000 AD was significant (r = 0.498, edf = 34, p<0.01). Specially, the records shared high correlation coefficients in the epochs of the solar maximum (i.e. during the Medieval and Modern age), but poor correlation around 1500–1700 AD when the Spörer Minimum and Maunder Minimum occurred. It was similar to some other dendrochronological researches concerning the relation with solar activity. The relatively cold conditions between the two warm peaks around AD 1000 and 1100 seemed to be related to the Oort Minimum. …. Therefore, the temperature reconstructions based on the MDVM method agreed well in general with the characteristic variations of the solar and volcanic forcings. … It was also reported that the abrupt onset of the LIA was likely triggered by a succession of strong volcanic eruptions and sustained by sea-ice/ocean feedbacks. According to mainstream opinions, the LIA type events were probably attributed to a combination of solar minima and volcanic eruptions.
86.  Voarintsoa et al., 2016       Multiple proxies … from Dante Cave [southwestern Africa] indicate a linkage between changes in hydroclimate in northeastern Namibia and changes in solar activity and changes in global temperatures. The record suggests that during solar minima and globally cooler conditions (ca. 1660–1710 and ca. 1790–1830 [Little Ice Age]), wetter periods (reflecting longer summer seasons) in northeastern Namibia were linked to advances of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and the Inter-Ocean Convergence Zone (IOCZ) southwestward.
87.  Chambers, 2016      The so-called ‘Little Ice Age’ (LIA) of the 15th–19th centuries [1400-1900 AD] is a fascinating period of time, for many reasons. Extensive reading of the literature on the topic can reveal the following: (1) in many (but not all) proxy-climate reconstructions, it is shown as having a fast and strong onset (O’Brien et al., 1995), exceeded in the Holocene perhaps only by the 8.2ka event (Mayewski et al., 2004); (2) it includes evidence for glacier re-advance – in northern Europe, particularly, to positions not otherwise (or seldom) reached within the mid–late Holocene (McCarroll, 1991; Matthews and Shakesby, 1984; Nesje, 2009); (3) it follows the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) and precedes the period of recent ‘Global Warming’, and therefore, it post-dates the Medieval Solar Maximum, encompasses up to three solar minima (Spörer, Maunder and Dalton) (Grove, 1988), and precedes the ‘Contemporary’ (namely, late 20th century) Solar Maximum (Hoyt and Schatten, 1997; Pan and Yau, 2002); (4) there are multiple hypotheses as to the cause of its onset (cf. Miller et al., 2012), although it is widely considered that reduced solar activity is the cause of at least its most intense phases (cf. Mauquoy et al., 2002) …. (12) recent work implies an in-phase relationship between the Southern and Northern Hemispheres [the Little Ice Age was a global event] (Chambers et al., 2014; Simms et al., 2012).
88.  Sanchez-Lopez et al., 2016       The dominant warm and arid conditions during the MCA [Medieval Climate Anomaly, 900-1300  CE], and the cold and wet conditions during the LIA [Little Ice Age, 1300-1850 CE] indicate the interplay of the NAO+, EA+ and NAO- , EA- [positive/negative North Atlantic Oscillation, East Atlantic phases], respectively. Furthermore, the higher solar irradiance during the [“warm conditions”] RP [Roman Period, 200 BCE – 500 CE] and MCA [Medieval Climate Anomaly, 900-1300 CE] may support the predominance of the EA+ [positive East Atlantic] phase, whereas the opposite scenario [“colder temperatures”] during the EMA [Early Middle Age, 500-900 CE] and LIA [Little Ice Age, 1300-1850 CE] may support the predominance of the EA- [negative East Atlantic] phase, which would favour the occurrence of frequent and persistent blocking events in the Atlantic region during these periods.
89.  Bauchi Danladi and Akçer-Ön, 2016       Due to the variability of the Little Ice Age (LIA) and Medieval Climatic Anomaly (MCA), several climatic forcing mechanisms have been invoked to enlighten the issue. The focus of this study is on the influence of the solar activity proxy (Total Solar Irradiance) during the LIA and MCA in a high altitude Lake Salda in south-western Anatolia.  … [T]he sediment records cover the last millennium. We have observed the effect of the solar activity throughout the LIA and MCA in Lake Salda, with wet and dry spells corresponding to high and low TSI [total solar irradiance] respectively. In addition, the Dalton Minimum, Maunder Minimum, Spörer Minimum, Wolf Minimum, the Medieval Maximum and the Oort Minimum have been observed.
90.  Li et al., 2016       Our results support the view that over the past millennium, on a multi-centennial timescale, the moisture variations in ACA [arid Central Asia] were generally out-of-phase with those in the region affected by the Asian summer monsoon. The humid, unstable LIA [Little Ice Age] climate in ACA [arid Central Asia] may have been associated with changes in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index and/or with variations in solar irradiance.
91.  Guo et al., 2016       A regional synthesis of the palaeoflood chronology over the last 3000 years was compiled along the middle Yangtze River. Extraordinary flood events generally seem to be correlated with late Holocene climatic variability (i.e. Neoglacial cooling, Roman Warm Period, Dark Ages Cold Period, Medieval Climate Anomaly, and Little Ice Age). The high-resolution climatic proxies from stalagmites of the Dongge cave and Heshang cave, ice-cores of the GRIP, the total solar irradiance variations and sunspot number, and ENSO activities suggest that these hydroclimatic events are possibly related to the weaker Asia summer monsoon and the cooling climatic events, as well as the stronger ENSO activities during the late Holocene in the Yangtze River valley. These results provide insights into the response of hydroclimatic system to global change in the large rivers of Asia.
92.  Miettinen et al., 2016       The results demonstrate both abrupt changes and a clear centennial-bicentennial variability for the last millennium. The Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) between 1000 and 1200 CE represents the warmest ocean surface conditions of the SE Greenland shelf over the late Holocene (880 BCE-1910 CE). MCA in the current record is characterized by abrupt, decadal to multidecadal changes, such as an abrupt warming of ~2.4 °C in 55 years around 1000 CE. Temperature changes of these magnitudes are rarely observed in other proxy records from the North Atlantic. … A cool phase, from 1200-1890 CE, associated with the Little Ice Age (LIA), ends with the rapid warming of aSST and diminished aSIC in the early 20th century. The phases of warm aSST and aSIC minima on the SE Greenland shelf and solar minima of the last millennium are antiphased, suggesting that solar forcing possibly amplified by atmospheric forcing has been behind the aSST variability on the SE Greenland over the last millennium. 
93.  Zhu et al., 2016       During the period 1875–1955, late summer temperature fluctuated less strongly than before or thereafter. In general, the average length of cold periods was shorter than that of warm periods. The cold period of 1869–1877 was the longest and coldest cool period had a mean of 17.63°C. The longest warm period extended from 1655 to 1668, and the warmest period in AD 1719–1730 had a mean of 20.37°C. However, we should point out that the rapid warming during the 20th century was not especially obvious in our reconstructed RLST. … [S]even cold periods and three warm periods were identified during the past 368 years (Fig. 4d). All the cold periods were during the Maunder (1708–1711) or Dalton (1818– 1821, 1824–1828, 1832–1836, and 1839–1842) solar minima periods, except for the cold periods of 1765–1769 and 1869–1877 (Eddy, 1976; Shindell et al., 1999), which indicated that RLST [mean maximum temperature] variations in the NWSP [northwestern Sichuan Plateau, China ] might be driven by solar activity (Fig. 7b). On the other hand, volcanic eruptions in the corresponding periods might also be a cooling factor (Fig. 7b). A longer cold period (e.g., 1820s–1840s) was interrupted by transient warming, thus forming a plurality of discontinuous short cold periods. Warm periods of 1719–1730 and 1858–1859 both had more sunspots (Eddy, 1976; Shindell et al., 1999) and lower volcanic forcing (Fig. 7b). The cold (1765–1769 or 1869–1877) and warm (1655–1668) periods were highly consistent with other studies (Fig. 7). … Accompanied by significant peaks at 60.2 and 73 years, the continuously periodicities around 49–114 years in our regional temperature reconstruction might tentatively be related to PDO, Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO; En- field et al., 2001) as well as solar activity (Eddy, 1976; Shindell et al., 1999; Peristykh and Damon, 2003; Raspopov et al., 2004; Braun et al., 2005). … [S]ignificant multidecadal- and centennial-scale cycles of our temperature reconstruction might include the signs of solar activity, such as the Gleissberg cycles (Peristykh and Damon, 2003), Suess cycles (Braun et al., 2005), Bruckner cycles (Raspopov et al., 2004), and Schwabe cycles (Braun et al., 2005). The Maunder (ca. AD 1645–1715) and Dalton (ca. AD 1790–1840) solar minima periods were generally associated with temperature depressions (Eddy, 1976), and the Damon (ca. AD 1890– 1920) solar maximum period occurred in a relatively warm period, which further confirmed that late summer temperature variation in the NWSP [northwestern Sichuan Plateau, China ]  might be driven by solar activity (Fig. 7b). … Conclusion: Overall, the RLST [mean maximum temperature] variability in the NWSP [northwestern Sichuan Plateau, China ]  might be associated with global land–sea atmospheric circulation (e.g., ENSO, PDO, or AMO) as well as solar and volcanic forcing.
94.  Lyu et al., 2016       The reconstructed April–July MMT series exhibited six cold and seven warm periods. The longest cold period lasted from AD 1645 to 1677 (33 years), with an average temperature of 0.5 ◦C below the mean value. The longest warm period, however, lasted from AD 1767 to 1785 (19 years), and the average temperature was 0.69 ◦C above the mean value (Table 4). Four cold (1605–1616, 1645–1677, 1911–1924, and 1951–1969) and warm (1795–1807, 1838– 1848, 1856–1873, and 1991–2008) periods were consistent with other results of tree-ring reconstructions in northeast China (Shao and Wu, 1997; Yin et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2015). In addition, two cold periods (1645– 1677 and 1684–1691) were consistent with the Maunder Minimum (1645–1715), an interval of decreased solar irradiance (Bard et al., 2000). … The three temperature series exhibited significantly low temperature periods during the 1950s–1970s, which coincided with a slight decrease in solar activity from AD 1940 to 1970 (Beer et al., 2000; Fig. 7).
95.  Hanna, 2016       Temperature reconstructions from Simpson Lagoon also show similarities with regional and pan-Arctic climate records over the last few millennia, with evidence of temperature departures correlative with noted climate events (i.e., Little Ice Age, Medieval Climate Anomaly). … This paleoclimate variability may be driven by variations in solar output and/or shifts in the regional ocean-atmosphere circulation patterns (e.g., the Aleutian Low).
Projected 21st Century Cooler Temperatures Due To Lower Solar Activity
96.  Abdussamatov, 2016       The quasi-centennial epoch of the new Little Ice Age has started at the end 2015 after the maximum phase of solar cycle 24. The start of a solar grand minimum is anticipated in solar cycle 27 ± 1 in 2043 ± 11 and the beginning of phase of deep cooling in the new Little Ice Age in 2060 ± 11. The gradual weakening of the Gulf Stream leads to stronger cooling in the zone of its action in western Europe and the eastern parts of the United States and Canada. Quasi-bicentennial cyclic variations of TSI together with successive very important influences of the causal feedback effects are the main fundamental causes of corresponding alternations in climate variation from warming to the Little Ice Age.
97.  Yndestad and Solheim, 2016       In 1890´s G. Spörer and E. W. Maunder (1890) reported that the solar activity stopped in a period of 70 years from 1645 to 1715. Later a reconstruction of the solar activity confirms the grand minima Maunder (1640-1720), Spörer (1390-1550), Wolf (1270-1340), and the minima Oort (1010-1070) and Dalton (1785-1810) since the year 1000 A.D. (Usoskin et al. 2007). These minimum periods have been associated with less irradiation from the Sun and cold climate periods on Earth. An identification of a three grand Maunder type periods and two Dalton type periods in a period thousand years, indicates that sooner or later there will be a colder climate on Earth from a new Maunder- or Dalton- type period. …. The result shows that the TSI variability and the sunspots variability have deterministic oscillations, controlled by the large planets Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune, as the first cause. A deterministic model of TSI [total solar irradiance] variability and sunspot variability confirms the known minimum and grand minimum periods since 1000. From this deterministic model we may expect a new Maunder type sunspot minimum period from about 2018 to 2055. The deterministic model of a TSI ACRIM data series from 1700 computes a new Maunder type grand minimum period from 2015 to 2071. A model of the longer TSI ACRIM data series from 1000 computes a new Dalton to Maunder type minimum irradiation period from 2047 to 2068.
98.  Torres and Guzmán, 2016       Based on our results, we propose the use of the Wolf’s Number Oscillation Index (WNOI) – as a more uniform alternative to the ONI – in the range over 30 and below -30. The analysis of the material presented and the arguments discussed allows us to define a possible relationship between phenomena related to Solar Cycle, the ENSO, climatic conditions, as well as some criteria for the establishment of public policies for preservation and remediation of the environment in the long run. We can conclude that solar activity oscillations impact the earth climatic conditions to such a extent that they become measurable only in the long run. The magnitude of the Solar Cycle – from 7 to 17 and a mean of 11.2 years – seems to support this statement. Based on the similarities of the Solar Cycles 5 and 24 we can expect a longer period of cold weather for the years 2022 y/o 2034, corresponding to the Solar Cycles 24 and 25.
99.  Chiodo et al., 2016       Solar variability represents a source of uncertainty in the future forcings used in climate model simulations. Current knowledge indicates that a descent of solar activity into an extended minimum state is a possible scenario. With aid of experiments from a state-of-the-art Earth system model, we investigate the impact of a future solar minimum on Northern Hemisphere climate change projections. This scenario is constructed from recent 11 year solar-cycle minima of the solar spectral irradiance, and is therefore more conservative than the ‘grand’ minima employed in some previous modeling studies. Despite the small reduction in total solar irradiance (0.36 W m−2), relatively large responses emerge in the winter Northern Hemisphere, with a reduction in regional-scale projected warming by up to 40%. To identify the origin of the enhanced regional signals, we assess the role of the different mechanisms by performing additional experiments forced only by irradiance changes at different wavelengths of the solar spectrum. We find that a reduction in visible irradiance drives changes in the stationary wave pattern of the North Pacific and sea–ice cover. A decrease in UV irradiance leads to smaller surface signals, although its regional effects are not negligible. These results point to a distinct but additive role of UV and visible irradiance in the Earth’s climate, and stress the need to account for solar forcing as a source of uncertainty in regional scale projections.
100.  Sanchez-Sesma, 2016       This empirical modeling of solar recurrent patterns has also provided a consequent multi-millennial-scale experimental forecast, suggesting a solar decreasing trend toward grand (super) minimum conditions for the upcoming period, AD 2050–2250 (AD 3750–4450). … Solar activity (SA) has non-linear characteristics that influence multiple scales in solar processes (Vlahos and Georgoulis, 2004). For instance, millennia-scale solar oscillations have been recently detected, like those of about 6000 and 2400 years, by Xapsos and Burke (2009) and Charvátová (2000), respectively, with important and interesting influences in the near, past and future climate. These millennialscale patterns of reconstructed SA variability could justify epochs of low activity, such as the Maunder minimum, as well as epochs of enhanced activity, such as the current Modern Maximum, and the Medieval maximum in the 12th century. … We can conclude that the evidence provided is sufficient to justify a complete updating and reviewing of present climate models to better consider these detected natural recurrences and lags in solar processes.
Past Periods of Low Solar Activity Led to Cooling, More Droughts, Floods, and Hurricanes, Famines, Plagues, and Agricultural/Socioeconomic Collapse
101.  Camenisch et al., 2016       Climate reconstructions from a multitude of natural and human archives indicate that, during winter, the period of the early Spörer Minimum (1431–1440 CE) was the coldest decade in Central Europe in the 15th century. The particularly cold winters and normal but wet summers resulted in a strong seasonal cycle that challenged food production and led to increasing food prices, a subsistence crisis, and a famine in parts of Europe. As a consequence, authorities implemented adaptation measures, such as the installation of grain storage capacities, in order to be prepared for future events. The 15th century is characterised by a grand solar minimum and enhanced volcanic activity, which both imply a reduction of seasonality. 
102.  Chae and Park, 2016       We present a multi-proxy record (pollen, microscopic charcoal, carbon-isotopic composition [δ13C], organic content, and particle size) of the late-Holocene climate change and human impact from central-eastern South Korea. The Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) and Little Ice Age (LIA), the most recent major climate events, have not been accurately investigated by paleolimnological studies in Korea, mainly due to a lack of undisturbed sediments and indifference to the past climate change. Our pollen records show late- Holocene centennial climate variations characterized by the successive solar minimums of the Oort, Wolf, Spörer, Maunder, and Dalton. We find paleoenvironmental evidence for shifting cultivation associated with serious droughts and consequent famines during the early 19th-century Dalton minimum. Our interpretation of human activities is well supported by Korean historical documents describing socioeconomic suffering induced by LIA climate deteriorations.
103.  Büntgen et al., 2016       Climatic changes during the first half of the Common Era have been suggested to play a role in societal reorganizations in Europe and Asia. In particular, the sixth century coincides with rising and falling civilizations, pandemics, human migration and political turmoil. Our understanding of the magnitude and spatial extent as well as the possible causes and concurrences of climate change during this period is, however, still limited. Here we use tree-ring chronologies from the Russian Altai and European Alps to reconstruct summer temperatures over the past two millennia. We find an unprecedented, long-lasting and spatially synchronized cooling following a cluster of large volcanic eruptions in 536, 540 and 547 AD, which was probably sustained by ocean and sea-ice feedbacks, as well as a solar minimum. We thus identify the interval from 536 to about 660 AD as the Late Antique Little Ice Age. Spanning most of the Northern Hemisphere, we suggest that this cold phase be considered as an additional environmental factor contributing to the establishment of the Justinian plague, transformation of the eastern Roman Empire and collapse of the Sasanian Empire, movements out of the Asian steppe and Arabian Peninsula, spread of Slavic-speaking peoples and political upheavals in China.
104.  Katsuki et al., 2016       [W]e reconstructed the history of typhoon and storm-rain activity only for the interval AD 1400–1900. The record indicates that typhoon frequency throughout the Korean Peninsula varied in response to the state of the El Niño/Southern Oscillation. Typhoon variability was likely modulated further by the state of the East Asia summer monsoon (EASM) pattern, associated with variation in the magnitude of solar irradiance. During periods of minimum solar activity, such as the early Maunder Minimum (AD 1650–1675), typhoons struck the east China coast and Korean Peninsula more frequently because of a strengthened EASM.
105.  Gogou et al., 2016       We provide new evidence on sea surface temperature (SST) variations and paleoceanographic/paleoenvironmental changes over the past 1500 years for the north Aegean Sea (NE Mediterranean). The reconstructions are based on multiproxy analyses, obtained from the high resolution (decadal to multi-decadal) marine record M2 retrieved from the Athos basin. Reconstructed SSTs show an increase from ca. 850 to 950 AD and from ca. 1100 to 1300 AD. A cooling phase of almost 1.5°C is observed from ca. 1600 AD to 1700 AD. This seems to have been the starting point of a continuous SST warming trend until the end of the reconstructed period, interrupted by two prominent cooling events at 1832 ± 15 AD and 1995 ± 1 AD. … Internal variability in atmospheric/oceanic circulations systems as well as external forcing as solar radiation and volcanic activity could have affected temperature variations in the north Aegean Sea over the past 1500 years. … The paleoclimatic evidence derived from the M2 record is combined with a socio-environmental study of the history of the north Aegean region. We show that the cultivation of temperature-sensitive crops, i.e. walnut, vine and olive, co-occurred with stable and warmer temperatures, while its end coincided with a significant episode of cooler temperatures. Periods of agricultural growth in Macedonia coincide with periods of warmer and more stable SSTs, but further exploration is required in order to identify the causal links behind the observed phenomena. The Black Death likely caused major changes in agricultural activity in the north Aegean region, as reflected in the pollen data from land sites of Macedonia and the M2 proxy-reconstructions. Finally, we conclude that the early modern peaks in mountain vegetation in the Rhodope and Macedonia highlands, visible also in the M2 record, were very likely climate-driven.
106.  Stockhecke et al., 2016       Millennial to orbital-scale rainfall changes in the Mediterranean region and corresponding variations in vegetation patterns were the result of large-scale atmospheric reorganizations. In spite of recent efforts to reconstruct this variability using a range of proxy archives, the underlying physical mechanisms have remained elusive. Through the analysis of a new high-resolution sedimentary section from Lake Van (Turkey) along with climate modeling experiments, we identify massive droughts in the Eastern Mediterranean for the past four glacial cycles, which have a pervasive link with known intervals of enhanced North Atlantic glacial iceberg calving, weaker Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and Dansgaard-Oeschger cold conditions. On orbital timescales, the topographic effect of large Northern Hemisphere ice sheets and periods with minimum insolation [low solar activity] seasonality further exacerbated drought intensities by suppressing both summer and winter precipitation.
107.  Kaniewski et al., 2016       Solar pacing of storm surges, coastal flooding and agricultural losses in the Central Mediterranean … Storm surges, leading to catastrophic coastal flooding, are amongst the most feared natural hazards due to the high population densities and economic importance of littoral areas. Using the Central Mediterranean Sea as a model system, we provide strong evidence for enhanced periods of storminess leading to coastal flooding during the last 4500 years. We show that long-term correlations can be drawn between storminess and solar activity, acting on cycles of around 2200-yr and 230-yr. We also find that phases of increased storms and coastal flooding have impacted upon mid- to late Holocene agricultural activity on the Adriatic coast. Based on the general trend observed during the second half of the 20th century, climate models are predicting a weakening of Mediterranean storminess. By contrast, our new data suggest that a decrease in solar activity will increase and intensify the risk of frequent flooding in coastal areas.

"One hundred and fifty years ago Ludwig Becker, a member of the Burke and Wills expedition, did a sketch of the Menindee pub, which sits between the Darling River and Menindee Lakes. At that time Menindee wasn’t considered big enough to be called a town but these days it needs a school for more than 100 pupils. Three-quarters of these children are descendants of the Barkindji and Nyampa people, who have lived, hunted and passed down their oral histories on the banks of the Darling for more than 40,000 years. When Burke was camped at Menindee he met William Wright, a local station manager. Wright was charged with leading a small group to transport supplies to the camp at Cooper Creek. His contingent was joined by Becker. En route to Cooper Creek, Wright’s group pitched tents by the Koorliatto waterhole on the Bulloo River. They were visited by Mr Shirt, a Bandjigali or Karenggapa Murri man whose portrait was also painted for posterity by Becker. Mr Shirt, a “born diplomat”, tried to explain the problem the explorers were causing: “The area belonged to his tribe. Soon they were coming here to celebrate a feast … neighbouring tribes were already coming to drive us away.” Not long after that conversation Wright shot Mr Shirt.  The theft of water in the Murray-Darling basin has a long history and it began when Burke and Wills walked from Royal Park to Moonee Ponds, another 750km to Menindee, then north again, with little clue as to what they were doing. Seven white men died on the expedition (including Becker), along with Mr Shirt. Twelve Ngawun men were killed by Frederick Walker, a notorious former Native Police officer who led one of the expeditions that searched for the remains of the Burke and Wills party in 1861. The expedition was the first in Australia to use camels to carry supplies. The descendants of some of these camels still live in the outback. The problem is this: a herd of thirsty camels can drink a waterhole dry quickly. When these early explorers arrived they took precious resources – water, fish – from the nations whose land they were on. While welcomed for short stays, they were considered a pest when they set up camp for long stints. After the European occupation, the nations living through the Murray-Darling basin were steadily dispossessed as the land and waters were exploited for agriculture. Fast forward to February 2020. Torrential rain fell along the east coast of Australia – more than 350mm in some places, delivering the highest February daily rainfall on record. On 10 February the NSW Rural Fire Service tweeted: “This is the most positive news we’ve had in some time. The recent rainfall has assisted firefighters to put over 30 fires out since Friday. Some of these blazes have been burning for weeks and even months.” Floods are destructive but they used to mean good things as well. They gave life to river systems and wetlands, they flushed out sediments and salt. Rivers met each other in a rush and their mouths opened to the sea. But, as droughts grow longer, black water becomes more deadly. As temperatures rise, the air holds more moisture, which increases the likelihood of intense rainstorms. When heavy rain falls on to eroded and parched soil it doesn’t seep into the ground so much as skid and skim over the top of it. Insurance claims were filed from south-east Queensland down the New South Wales coastline. Damage claims were also reported several hundred kilometres inland. Floods are estimated to be the most costly natural disaster in Australia, and the Insurance Council of Australia immediately declared February’s floods a catastrophe, the sixth they’d declared in a five-month period. The time we are living through has been described as an era of disasters, a time “when emergency services will likely be stretched, community resilience undermined, and economic costs and loss of life increased”. It can take a while for flood water to reach water catchments but, by mid-March, waters were expected in Menindee for the first time in three years. This was cause for celebration. Menindee had been in survival mode for months, if not years. Several hundred Murray cod and golden perch were swimming around in an aerated weir pool in the hope that they too, could survive the drying of the Darling River and Menindee Lakes. A Menindee man, Graeme McCrabb, was one of a number of locals who had rescued fish throughout 2019. This meant that 12 March 2020 felt like a good day, for a change. McCrabb – indeed the entire town – was relieved by the arrival of the water, and the life that swam and flew along with it. This water signified the possibility that the Murray-Darling river system might become connected from end to end after many years of being strangled. And indeed, the rivers did join, and they did meet the sea. Just. But welcome as the water was there were also concerns. During droughts, organic matter like leaves builds up on floodplains and the banks of rivers. When substantial rain finally occurs and water flows over river banks on to the floodplain, it collects this debris and dumps it in the river, causing oxygen levels in the water to drop significantly. This kind of flooding is described as “black water”. It can cause fish to die, a particularly unwelcome possibility given that up to 1 million fish had already died along a 40km stretch of the Darling River in far west NSW during the previous summer. WaterNSW forecast that up to 285 gigalitres might reach Menindee after February’s rain but it takes 1,700 gigalitres to fill Menindee’s waterways. A look at historical data from Wilcannia River, the stretch that leads into Menindee Lakes, tells you that the highest volume of water to flow into Menindee in a single day was 68,415 megalitres. That was in 1976, just a few years after records began. The strongest flow in 2020 occurred on 19 March, the day before the waters reached Menindee, and was a mere 13,080 megalitres. Not enough to compensate for the fact that the previous year had been the worst on record. Not enough to compensate McCrabb and the many others who’d stood above Menindee’s Weir 32, watching in horror as tens of thousands of golden perch flapped and strained and “tens of thousands of little bony bream” lay dead. At the time, those (multiple) fish kills were described by the NSW government as “distressing” and unavoidable. “We cannot control the weather,” said the premier, Gladys Berejiklian. They were avoidable. And, while we may not be in control of it, the weather is on us as well. The Murray-Darling basin covers nearly a seventh of the Australian continent and touches on the traditional land and waters of 34 Indigenous nations. In 2015 the federal court recognised the rights of the Barkindji peoples to 128,000 sq km of land, which included both sides of almost the entire length of the Darling River. At the time of the fish kills, the Barkindji elder William Badger Bates remembered that one of the arguments used to harvest water from the Menindee Lakes was that if it were left, the water would simply evaporate. He called bullshit. “Don’t anyone try to tell me or my people or the rest of the people that these lakes evaporate … we have known them for thousands of years before,” Bates said. What is true is that the lakes are in a semi-arid area, they are shallow and have a large surface area. In most years the equivalent of one Sydney Harbour of water turns to vapour there. But there are many ways for water to evaporate. These include irrigation, fraudulent transactions and water theft: legal and illegal. The entire basin has been starved of water and suffocated by a system of bureaucracy that is confusing to the point of being impenetrable, and, as a consequence, easy to corrupt. To quote the journalist Margaret Simons: “It’s impossible for ordinary citizens to find out who owns water, or who has made a trade.” After the fish kills, there were various emergency summits. “No one expects the river to run every year,” said Prof Craig Moritz, who chaired an Australian Academy of Science panel, “but they have cut the water so hard, the river is dying.” Bates would have agreed with this assessment, but, despite being a traditional owner, he only found out about these summits after they’d been held. After this “oversight”, an amendment to the Water Act was finally passed in October 2019 that established a position for an Indigenous person on the Murray-Darling Basin Authority board. The Murray-Darling basin plan sets limits on how much water can be taken from the basin for irrigation, drinking water, industry or for other purposes. But, as Prof Jamie Pittock of the Australian National University’s Fenner School argues:, “The basin plan was written for a static environment and is not adapting to climate or other changes.” Pittock and others have also pointed out that some irrigators are more successful at exploiting the cap system, which has been described as many things, perhaps most evocatively as “leaky”. Pittock describes Menindee as the standout example of mismanagement in the entire Murray-Darling area. Its inadequacy in the face of a rapidly changing, increasingly challenging environment keeps him awake at night. “Our government fails to recognise, monitor and manage these risks,” he told me. “By the late 1990s water storages were in operation that could hold around three times the river system’s average natural flow to the sea and the diversion of water for irrigation resulted in severe environmental impacts.” He isn’t the only one losing sleep – most people who are living in the Murray-Darling Basin are enduring a nightmare. Since the late 1990s there has been a decline in rainfall of about 11% over the cooler months in the south-east of Australia, and projections make clear that this decline will continue. At the same time as climate change has begun delivering increasingly heavy blows, thirsty crops are the equivalent of Burke and Wills’s camels, guzzling a limited water supply. Scientists who work in the Murray-Darling basin have resorted to medical metaphors to describe what has been happening to this ecosystem. A wetland scientist, Richard Kingsford, likened the Macquarie marshes to “a very ill patient who has been given just enough care to get out of the ICU”. People of the Barkindji nation are blunter still. At the time of the fish kills, Lilliana Bennett recalled her grandmother talking about going down the riverbank to fish and hunt for goanna. The Darling River was an important place for her family. “It’s a place they go to relax, to tell stories,” she told SBS News. “For me, it’s been really devastating, I mean, we went down and camped by the river where there’s still a bit of water around and it just doesn’t have the same feeling. It’s dead water.” • This essay will be part of the anthology Fire, Flood and Plague, edited by Sophie Cunningham and published by Penguin Random House in December"
"Rare is the individual who hasn’t tripped over a pet or uneven pavement, tumbled off a bike, slipped on ice or maybe wiped out skiing or skating. Some get injured, while others go unhurt  —   often claiming it’s because they knew how to fall. According to paratroopers, stunt professionals, physical therapists and martial arts instructors, there is indeed a “right way” to fall  —   and it can save you a lot of grief if you know how to do it. Although often associated with older people, falls occur at any age and are the most common cause of injury seen in emergency rooms in the United States. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality estimates that falls cause more than a third of   emergency room visits, around 7. 9 million a year. “As physical therapists we talk a lot about preventing falls, but what we don’t talk about is what to do when you actually do fall,” said Jessica Schwartz, a physical therapist in New York City who trains athletes and people with prosthetic limbs to fall without hurting themselves. “It’s almost inevitable you are going to fall, so you really should know what to do. ” The number one thing to remember, she said, is to protect your head. So if you find yourself falling, pivot to your side and tuck in your head. “Have you seen those slip and fall cartoons where the characters fall flat on their back or face? Don’t do that,” said Dr. Schwartz. “You’ll hit your head like a coconut and get a concussion,” and the reverse motion, or bounce, of your head after impact “will give you something like whiplash. ” Moreover, falling straight forward or backward raises the risk of damaging your spine and vital organs. The other thing to avoid, she said, is “foosh,” an acronym for “falling onto outstretched hands. ” If you do that, all the force of impact will be concentrated there, raising the risk of breaking your wrist. You similarly don’t want to come crashing down on your knee so you break your kneecap or do that maneuver where you kind of pedal with your feet to catch yourself, which can lead to broken bones in your foot and ankle. Instead, if you feel yourself falling, experts said you should bend your elbows and knees and try to take the hit on the fleshiest parts of your body, like the side of your thigh, buttocks and shoulder. “Aim for the meat, not bone,” said Kevin Inouye, a stuntman and assistant professor of acting, movement and stage combat at the University of Wyoming. “Your instinct will be to reach out with hands or try to catch yourself with your knee or foot, but they are hard and not forgiving when you go down. ” The key is to not fight the fall, but just to roll with it, as paratroopers do. “The idea is to orient your body to the ground so when you hit, there’s a multistep process of hitting and shifting your body weight to break up that impact,” said Sgt. First Class Chuck Davidson, master trainer at the Army’s Advanced Airborne School at Ft. Bragg, N. C. Paratroopers’ goal is to fall sideways in the direction the wind is carrying them  —   in no way resisting the momentum of the fall. When the balls of their feet barely reach the ground, they immediately distribute the impact in rapid sequence up through the calf to the thigh and buttocks. Then they roll over on the latissimus dorsi muscle, the large, flat muscle running laterally down the side of your back, and kick their feet over, shifting their weight so they end up supine with legs bent in front of them. The procedure is strikingly similar to how martial arts practitioners learn to take a fall when they are, say, thrown over someone’s shoulder or have their legs knocked out from under them. “I would say the principles we follow are: Accept that you’re falling and go with it, round your body, and don’t stiffen and distribute the energy so you take the fall in the widest area possible,” said Paul Schreiner, a black belt jiu jitsu instructor at Marcelo Garcia Academy in New York City. While martial arts falls often have a gymnastic aspect, with rather elegant and snappy kinds of somersaults, it’s still all about spreading out the force of impact. “There may be an aesthetic component, but what it does is save the body,” said Mr. Schreiner. “If you don’t take the fall in any single place, you’ll still walk out sore, but you’ll walk out of there. ” Difficult as it may sound as you’re hurtling toward the ground  —   medical bills and disability flashing through your mind  —   experts said it’s important to relax as you fall. You’re less likely to hurt yourself if you soften up all your muscles and exhale. Rigidity is your enemy, while pliability is your friend. “As unfair as it is, that’s why people who are drunk” tend to be the ones who “don’t get hurt in car crashes,” said Mr. Inouye. “They are loose and just flop around. ” Of course, you will be better able to loosen up, pivot to your side, tuck and roll if you are in good physical condition. “If you have a room full of soccer players and computer desk workers and go around knocking people over, you can bet the soccer players are going to be less likely to get hurt because of their superior strength, agility and coordination,” said Erik Moen, a physical therapist in Kenmore, Wash. But that doesn’t mean you have to be an elite athlete or paratrooper to fall the “right way. ” Young children are arguably the best fallers because they have yet to develop fear or embarrassment, so they just tumble and roll without tensing up and trying to catch themselves. Physical therapists can be helpful in assessing your weaknesses and prescribing    exercises to improve your strength and agility (for example, jumping from side to side and on and off platforms or steps) so that you will be better able to execute a fall as well as lessen the risk that you will fall in the first place."

Freedom of speech has been severely criticized at many American universities. Meanwhile, such prestigious transnational institutions as the United Nations and the European Union have endorsed censorship of hate speech, as well as denial of Holocaust and climate change, and even blasphemy.



Those trends are antithetical to classically liberal ideals about both the freedom of speech and the purpose of the university. John Stuart Mill thought higher education should not tell us what it is our duty to believe, but should “help us to form our own belief in a manner worthy of intelligent beings.” He added that “there ought to exist the fullest liberty of professing and discussing, as a matter of ethical conviction, any doctrine,” regardless of its falsity, immorality, or even harmfulness.



The classical liberal argument for free speech has historically been championed in two distinct ways. First, the Founding documents of the United States recognize freedom of speech as a natural right. Second, alternatively, that right might be grounded in utility, meaning its acceptance best promotes human flourishing. Ironically, the very trends on campus that threaten freedom of speech also lend strong support to both justifications for it.



Many academics now consider freedom of speech just another American eccentricity, like guns and religion. What they call free speech fundamentalism is misguided at best, in their view, and an embarrassment before our more sophisticated European counterparts. Meanwhile, such prestigious transnational institutions as the United Nations and the European Union have endorsed censorship of a wide range of opinions classified as hate speech, as well as Holocaust and climate change denial, and even blasphemy—when called defamation of religion or incitement to religious hatred (and selectively applied). These developments coincide with the growing antagonism toward freedom of speech at American universities, especially from the most politically assertive groups on campus.



In considering this phenomenon, note that academia is now overwhelmingly dominated by progressives and other leftists, many of whom are not only skeptical of freedom of speech but intolerant of dissenting opinion.1 When students protest speakers who challenge political orthodoxy, claiming to be oppressed by hateful opinions whose expression constitutes aggression against them, they often see no reason to limit their tactics to criticism and demonstration. Their violent rhetoric of aggression and assault encourages violent countermeasures. Not surprisingly, student protests are increasingly designed to punish their opponents and to prevent them from speaking or being heard: to shut them up or shout them down. The protesters are supported and encouraged by a vocal segment of activist faculty and are appeased by administrators—even when the protests shut down student events and transgress official university policy. Academic freedom, too, is now championed primarily as a matter of guild privilege, in defense of an activist pedagogy that promotes political orthodoxy and does not shrink from stifling dissent.



These trends are antithetical to classically liberal ideals about both the freedoms of conscience and the purpose of the university.2 John Stuart Mill expressed these ideals incisively by advocating a “more expository, less polemical, and above all less dogmatic” system of education, especially moral and religious education. The mission of higher education is not to tell us what it is our duty to believe, Mill held, but to “help us to form our own belief in a manner worthy of intelligent beings.”3 The autonomy of an individual requires that she be left free to make up her mind on the basis of evidence, acquainted with the strongest arguments for the opposing positions. Although the substance of academic orthodoxy has changed drastically since Mill’s time (for example, professors were required to swear an oath to the articles of the Church of England), skepticism about its dogmas is treated much the same: less to be defeated by argument than abolished by social sanction. When dissent is treated as immoral—a kind of secular heresy—the goal is not so much persuasion as decontamination. This is the current situation. Marxist philosophy professors argue on prominent blogs that conservative thinkers should be banned from campus lest they corrupt impressionable minds. Socrates would have recognized the argument.



Mill held that an atmosphere of intellectual freedom not only cultivates genius but is also a prerequisite for even commonplace knowledge. For our beliefs to be justified, we must be able to respond to the best arguments against them. Yet people naturally dislike what Mill called adverse discussion—that is, exposure to opposing arguments—and tend to avoid it. Hence, they are led to argue against straw men as much from ignorance as dishonesty. For those reasons and others, Mill defended freedom of speech in uncompromising terms: “[T]here ought to exist the fullest liberty of professing and discussing, as a matter of ethical conviction, any doctrine,” regardless of its falsity, immorality, or even harmfulness.4



Mill’s arguments for free speech anticipated several psychological phenomena that are now widely recognized: epistemic closure, group polarization, and confirmation bias, as well as simple conformism. _Epistemic closure_ is the tendency to restrict one’s sources of information, including other people, to those largely in agreement with one’s views, thereby avoiding adverse discussion. _Group polarization_ describes how like‐​minded people grow more extreme in their beliefs when unchecked by the presence of dissenters. (Whence Nietzsche: “Madness is rare in individuals—but in groups, parties, nations, and ages it is the rule.”5) _Confirmation bias_ is the tendency to focus on evidence that supports what we already believe and to discount contrary evidence. These phenomena are widespread and well documented, and they all tend to undermine the justification of our beliefs. Hence, the toleration of unpopular opinions constitutes a prerequisite for knowledge. Yet such toleration amounts only to its immunity to punishment, not its protection from criticism.



The classical liberal argument for free speech has historically been championed in two distinct ways. First, the Founding documents of the United States recognize freedom of speech as a natural right: self‐​evident, inalienable, and endowed by our Creator. Those words still inspire many people, and the Bill of Rights stands among the paramount achievements of classical liberalism. But there is a problem with natural rights claims in general: they are vulnerable to competing claims about exactly what rights we have.6 Thus, in this election cycle, we hear that among our moral rights are access to health care at unspecified levels, free college tuition, and an increased minimum wage. Of course, not all these claims are equally compelling. The point is that sincere disagreement over rights claims makes less plausible the idea that they are self‐​evident truths. The second way to defend rights claims is to ground them in utility, by claiming that their acceptance best promotes human flourishing.



That was Mill’s approach, but it has problems of its own. The trouble with this utilitarian argument is that it is always open to dispute: Would it be optimal to violate a right in exceptional circumstances? In short, the natural rights approach to freedom of speech can seem too dogmatic, and the utilitarian approach too contingent. The two approaches to classical liberalism are embodied, in the philosophical tradition, by John Locke and Mill, respectively. (Note that, although the natural rights approach inspired the U.S. Constitution, and the utilitarian Philosophical Radicals led the liberal movement in 19th‐​century England, neither the natural rights nor the utilitarian tradition has been uniformly liberal in the classical sense that I use in this essay.7) But if freedom of speech is now especially in need of defense within academia, then, ironically, the very trends on campus that threaten it also lend strong support to both versions of the liberal argument.



The traditional objection to free speech is straightforward. It holds that some opinions are so dangerous or immoral—and of such little value—that their expression should be prohibited. Hence, we must reject the liberal claim to rights of free expression for the sake of the common good or the preservation of the moral ecology. The current hostility toward freedom of speech among academics and intellectuals arises from three novel developments. Although the arguments are not entirely distinct or mutually exclusive, it is helpful to differentiate them as the _postmodern_ , the _progressive_ , and the _multiculturalist_ challenges to freedom of speech. The postmodern challenge holds that freedom of speech is impossible, because censorship is ubiquitous and inevitable. The progressive challenge holds that freedom of speech ought to be sacrificed to equality, understood in terms characteristic of the social justice ideology. And the multiculturalist challenge holds that certain opinions constitute violence against marginalized groups such as minorities and therefore fall beyond the pale of free speech protection; they are analogous to incitement or even assault.



Consider first the postmodern argument that freedom of speech is not so much misguided as impossible. Although defenders of free speech advance a seemingly absolute and neutral doctrine—the toleration of all opinions, liberal and illiberal alike—no one doubts that some speech must inevitably be prohibited and punished. Even Mill did not intend the immunity provided to the expression of all opinions and sentiments to extend to threats and fraud; that was his point in referring specifically to the fullest liberty of their profession and discussion _as a matter of ethical conviction_. Yet the claim that freedom of speech is impossible relies crucially on the truism that it would be impossible to tolerate all of what philosophers call _speech acts_ : actions performed by speaking. The clichéd example here is shouting “fire” in a crowded theater, which—in certain contexts, such as when intended to induce panic—lies beyond the pale of free speech immunity.8



That objection, however, presupposes a conception of freedom of speech as the freedom to perform _any_ speech act, which is to argue against a straw man. No defender of free speech advocates the liberty to do anything that can be done merely by speaking, such as to incite a riot or suborn murder. A more sophisticated version of this challenge admits that no one defends such sweeping immunity, but it claims these examples to show that what seems to be an argument about principle is really a political dispute over who is allowed to speak and who will be silenced. Yale law professor Robert Post insists that censorship is _inevitably_ “the norm rather than the exception” and celebrates the Left’s liberation from the constraints of toleration.9 Thus, contemporary debates over freedom of speech on campus have become power struggles in which the dominant political force silences opposition while claiming to represent the disempowered. Yet, this ironic state of affairs does not arise from any incoherence in the liberal conception of free speech but from a misguided or disingenuous caricature of it.



Mill used two examples to illustrate the liberal conception; together they anticipate and answer the crux of the postmodern challenge. First, Mill noted that the question of the _morality_ of the doctrine of tyrannicide—the opinion that it is legitimate to assassinate a tyrant—is irrelevant to his argument, because even immoral opinions are to be tolerated. Yet, he also discussed an example that might seem to vindicate the postmodern claim that censorship is inevitable: the case of the corn dealer and the mob. Mill insisted that the opinions that corn dealers are starvers of the poor and that property is theft must be allowed to be professed and discussed. Nevertheless, he agreed that the expression of those opinions can be punished, consistent with freedom of speech, when they are advocated to an angry mob gathered outside a corn dealer’s house. If Mill had been willing to prohibit opinions on the basis of their potential harmfulness, the postmodern challenge would have force against him. Disputes over whether moral and factual opinions have good or bad consequences are indeed inevitable, like disputes over their truth, as Mill acknowledged. Anyone who thinks some opinion is harmful would then claim that it falls beyond the pale of toleration. Because we all hold that view of one opinion or another, censorship would be ubiquitous, and the “free speech” debate would inevitably become merely political: a power struggle.



However, the corn dealer example does not constitute an exception for harmful speech as such, since the opinion that corn dealers are starvers of the poor threatens to harm the interests of corn dealers simply by being advocated, regardless of the context of its expression. In fact, Mill considered Proudhon’s dictum that property is theft (the other opinion mentioned in this passage) to be harmful to the interests of the poor as well as the rich.10 But he rejected the notion that even a false opinion such as that one, which would be harmful if generally believed, should be silenced in any ordinary context where its expression does not constitute some legitimately prohibited speech act. He thus made a point of reiterating that those opinions must be tolerated. Otherwise, this example would indeed conflict with his doctrine that even the “pernicious consequences” of an opinion do not put it beyond the pale of toleration.



Mill’s point was rather to illustrate the proper conception of freedom of speech, which protects it from the specious objection that censorship is ubiquitous and inevitable. Freedom of speech is not the freedom to say anything at any time, anywhere. It does not conflict with noise regulations at libraries or prohibitions on speech in monasteries. Even more significantly, it does not immunize all of the things that one can _do_ with words. As Mill put it, no one pretends that actions should be as free as opinions. The corn dealer example illustrates that, in certain peculiar but not unrealistic contexts, an act that would ordinarily be merely an expression of opinion constitutes a performative speech act: incitement to violence. Although certain tokens of expression of an opinion can be prohibited, that prohibition does not count as an exception to the absolute freedom of speech Mill advocated because it does not prohibit the expression of any doctrine as a matter of ethical (or scientific, political, or religious) discussion.11



The postmodern challenge thus founders but nonetheless illustrates an important point about the argumentative strategy employed by opponents of free speech. As soon as it is established that freedom of speech involves the freedom to express any opinion or sentiment but not to do more performative things with words (such as conspire to murder or incite riot), the antagonist will try to shoehorn despised opinions into the class of speech acts that lie beyond the pale of free speech immunity.



That tactic is the most insidious aspect of recent attempts to ban so‐​called incitement to religious hatred, which would prohibit those opinions deemed to be hateful or harmful in all contexts. To take a realistic case, an individual would not be free to question the dogma that Islam is a religion of peace. Again, the issue is not whether the opinion is true or false, moral or immoral, or even so vague as to be meaningless. It is rather that the postmodern challenge must either conflate speech and action (for instance as incitement to hatred) or ban certain opinions as intolerable (for instance by calling them hate speech). Here is one example: United Nations Secretary‐​General Ban Ki‐​moon has stated that, as much as he supports free speech, “When some people use this freedom of speech to provoke or humiliate some others’ values and beliefs, then this cannot be tolerated.”12 Notice that the criterion for toleration—that no one’s values or beliefs can be humiliated, or anyone provoked—would, if taken seriously and applied consistently, make censorship commonplace. Of course, no one actually proposes to apply the standard consistently; it merely serves as a heckler’s veto, or rather a rioter’s veto, of speech by incentivizing claims of provocation and humiliation.



Yet, many academics—including leading constitutional law scholars—consider this standard more sophisticated than what they decry as American exceptionalism. “In much of the developed world, one uses racial epithets at one’s legal peril,” Frederick Schauer, a First Amendment scholar at Harvard Law School, writes approvingly, “and one urges discrimination against religious minorities under threat of fine or imprisonment.”13 Even a ban on racial epithets faces the same problem: there is no principle for what counts as a slur and no prospect for consistency of application. Worse yet, the proposal that it be illegal to _urge_ discrimination empowers the politically powerful to censor dissent by declaring opinions to be discriminatory. Does it count as urging discrimination to publish polls on the percentages of Muslims in various countries who agree with various less‐​than‐​peaceful, even extremist, ideas? If we accepted the proposals of Schauer and others, that question would be answered at our legal peril. Clearly, those are not the conditions under which we can conduct an honest discussion of the claim that Islam is a religion of peace.



The crux of the matter is that a ban on _incitement to believe_ some opinion or to feel some sentiment differs from a ban on _incitement to riot_. To ban an opinion on the grounds of its value (whether it is truth value or moral value) would be to rule out its profession and discussion, which would eradicate the conditions under which it could be justified or undermined. And that would preclude knowledge by preventing us from making up our own minds in the manner worthy of intelligent beings: by weighing the arguments for and against it.



Consider contemporary efforts to suppress climate change “denial.” Those efforts ostensibly address a matter of empirical fact rather than an evaluative judgment. Yet, modern censors consider skepticism about catastrophic anthropogenic global warming so dangerous that it cannot be tolerated. Rather than engage in argument against the skeptical position, they seek to suppress it. The rhetoric of _denial_ is, of course, borrowed from Holocaust denial, which has been banned for decades in Europe without succeeding in eradicating the proscribed view, let alone eliminating the hatred and persecution of Jews. Similarly, the movement to ban climate change skepticism is not based on any calculation of the actual effects of toleration versus suppression. Instead, the argument is simply that because it would be bad for people to doubt the doctrine, skepticism should be suppressed. Again, dissent gets punished rather than refuted—here, in the name of science but contrary to the norms of scientific inquiry. And on matters in which scientific evidence seems to support heretical opinion—as with the existence of innate differences between the sexes—this fealty to science gets sacrificed to ideology.



As Post approvingly puts it, “Liberated from traditional inhibitions against official suppression of speech, the left has mobilized to pursue a rich variety of political agendas.”14 Notably, the agendas are evidently not so various as to include dissent from leftist orthodoxy. Even so, Post’s admission can be seen as admirably frank. Notwithstanding its pretenses to the contrary, the postmodern challenge is not some hypersophisticated “interrogation of all binary oppositions.” It is rather a stalking horse for another argument—the progressive challenge to freedom of speech—which at least has the virtue of being overtly ideological. Progressivism rejects the liberal’s individualistic focus on rights and personal responsibility in favor of collectivism and an expansive view of the legitimate role of state power.



That stark divergence has been obscured by the change in meaning of _liberal_ , especially in American usage, where it has become almost synonymous with _progressive_ as a name for leftist politics. Sometimes progressivism purports to be a merely pragmatic program with an optimistic view of the ability of government to promote the common good through paternalism and redistribution. Classical liberals take a narrower view of the legitimate role of government in principle and of its abilities in practice. But the profoundly illiberal turn of progressivism comes when it goes beyond the softer paternalism of seat belt laws and drug prohibitions—which at least compel people for the sake of goods they accept—to the radical claim of _false consciousness_. This is the idea that the unenlightened masses are pervasively mistaken about what is good for them, perhaps because they have been duped by repressive social norms, propaganda, or the machinations of the rich.



By its own admission, such a radical program cannot succeed by persuasion but must be subversive. In part, that subversion is linguistic, in that it involves coopting central liberal ideals such as toleration, freedom, and justice. The current illiberal moment cannot be understood without appreciating the manipulation of language at its core, especially through persuasive definition, meaning the redefinition of words to mask ideological claims as matters of fact or uncontroversial value judgments. A prominent figure in this subversive turn was Herbert Marcuse. He argued that “the realization of the objective of tolerance would call for _intolerance_ toward prevailing policies, attitudes, [and] opinions,” which he recommended expressly as “a partisan goal, a subversive liberating notion and practice.&rdquo;15



The general pattern of that argument is to advance a tendentious view of the objective of some liberal ideal, such as toleration or freedom of speech, and then claim that the end is best advanced through illiberal means. Though the underlying critique of liberalism can be put forward in an intellectually honest manner, the subversive aspect lies in the tendency to coopt the language of liberalism. (Note that Marcuse’s school of thought, critical theory, poses as blandly critical of the status quo rather than as advocating a specific ideology—when, in fact, its central inspiration is Marxist.) Whatever the substantive merits of this view, its _political_ weakness lies in the fact that its conception of liberation is so authoritarian that it can triumph only covertly, at least in the United States. Nevertheless, its success in academia can be seen in the widespread acceptance of the activist or “engaged” conception of the mission of the university.



Consider just one example by way of illustration. On October 22, 2012—two weeks before the presidential election—the University of Michigan sponsored a panel discussion whose original title was “The Republican War on Women.” That was, of course, a Democratic campaign slogan of the season. The panel comprised journalists from Jezebel​.com, Salon​.com, and _The Nation_ —all overtly leftist publications. The moderator, the chair of the Communications Department, is the author of essays called “It’s the Stupid Republicans, Stupid” and “It’s Okay to Hate Republicans.”16 Inconveniently for the organizers of the event, however, both Michigan law and university rules prohibit using public resources to engage in political activities for or against a candidate.17 The solution found by the event’s organizers, which evidently sufficed for the administration and university lawyers, was to rename the event, “The Republican War on Women?” The addition of a question mark was all that was required.



That is what the so‐​called scholarship of engagement looks like under one‐​party rule. It involves indoctrination into leftist causes—to the point of violation of law and university rules and the organized silencing of what exists of the Right—in the name of social justice. The protest side of campus activism silences dissenting opinion in two ways. It uses the traditional heckler’s veto methods of shouting down the opposition, blocking access to auditoriums, and otherwise menacing its antagonists. But the novel turn might be called the victim’s veto, which amplifies the offense taken to expressions of dissent into harm, in order to accuse those expressing unpopular opinions of violence.18 However benign the label—whether it is called the scholarship of engagement or campus activism—such fashionable deviations from the liberal conception of the mission of the university are hard to distinguish from indoctrination and censorship.



Subversive semantics allow many academics to deny that they are engaged in indoctrination despite championing activism that amounts to just that. Often, they sincerely see themselves as engaged merely in the pursuit of social justice: a substantive political program that purports to be simply morality. As F. A. Hayek noted, however, one would be hard pressed to find a definition of social justice that does not simply recapitulate leftist ideology. Insofar as the term has a determinate meaning, it opposes the liberal conception of justice as a criterion of individual conduct according to moral rules. “The most common attempts to give meaning to the concept of ‘social justice’ resort to egalitarian considerations,” Hayek wrote, “and argue that every departure from equality of material benefits enjoyed has to be justified by some recognizable common interest which these differences serve.”19



Perhaps some form of egalitarianism is true, but it requires an honest argument rather than persuasive definition. How can one oppose social justice except by being anti‐​social or anti‐​justice? Yet, that ideology subverts the liberal conception of justice, which is premised on equality under the law and other rules about what counts as permissible means to a desired end. And it has come into conflict with freedom of speech because its champions are now firmly in power on campus.



The great irony at the heart of the current attack on freedom of speech in academia is that the antagonists of free speech claim to be defending the victimized when, in fact, they are the oppressors. The social justice warriors on campus ignore the actual power structure of the university to maintain the pretense that those groups disempowered in society at large are similarly victimized within academia. Hence the third argument against freedom of speech, the multiculturalist challenge, has—in the name of diversity—become the driving force behind the antagonism to intellectual and political diversity on campus. This argument shares the ideology of the progressive argument and accepts the postmodern doctrine that censorship is inevitable. What is novel about the multiculturalist argument is that it invokes the rhetoric of violence as justification for its own threats. In this view, the only issue is how violence is going to be used: in service of the social justice agenda or against it.



American universities have steeped themselves in the rhetoric of violence at the expense of their traditional mission: training students to form beliefs in a manner fit for intelligent beings. College campuses haven’t actually become more violent. In fact, violent crime has decreased on campus, corresponding to its general decrease in recent decades. Certainly, Yale University—a recent flashpoint for the battle over free speech—is far safer than when I was a student there in the 1980s. Those days, the campus was less an oasis than a fort in the midst of blighted New Haven.20 Of course, most campuses are far safer than Yale’s. The current rash of violence is metaphorical, however, in that it fundamentally concerns opinions and their expression. This is a war of and about words.



The leading thought of this movement is that the expression of hateful ideas is literally an act of violence, which should be treated accordingly. In that view, words wound like weapons, and hate speech traumatizes its targets like the injuries caused by violent actions.21 But according to the multiculturalist argument, only specifically protected groups of people are vulnerable to the harms of hate speech. (No one considers punishing a department head who calls Republicans stupid and encourages hatred of them, for instance, on the grounds that she thereby commits violence against conservative students.) Moreover, those of us who reject the assimilation of speech with violence, without engaging in hate speech ourselves, are often claimed to be complicit in the assault on victims of institutional oppression. Our arguments are not disputed so much as denigrated as vestiges of privilege, even though they protect the speech rights of all students and faculty regardless of their politics or identity.



One of the most blatant examples of persuasive definition can be found in the claim, now approaching a dogma in academia, that only the powerful can be racist. That definition is not the commonplace meaning of _racism_ but a politically motivated redefinition, designed to obscure its subversion of the liberal commitment to equality under the law.22 Even if the racially motivated murder of a member of a nonprotected group cannot be racist, because the murderer lacks social or institutional power, that does not change anything about the action’s underlying nature. It just does not count as racist by stipulation, given the persuasively defined term.23 But moral arguments cannot rest on semantic fiat. If the racially motivated murder of a “privileged” victim cannot be racism, because of the persuasive definition, that does not change its character. We could call it racist* instead, though that approach would be to capitulate to subversive semantics.



Perhaps the most objectionable aspect of such a rhetorical ploy is that it gets used to defend hateful and even racist (or racist*) speech against dissenters who are women or minorities—even when the objectionable speech is perpetrated by white men, so long as it supports the progressive orthodoxy. As a matter of sociological fact, the immunity to racism and hate speech ordinarily given to members of protected groups does not extend to those who fail to espouse progressive positions. On the contrary, they are attacked even more vehemently as race traitors, often in overtly racist or sexist terms. Women, minorities, or gays and lesbians who dare to stray from the opinions they are supposed to have—that is, those considered representative of their assigned identity—not only are subject to abuse by the supposedly oppressed campus activists but also forfeit the special protections they would otherwise be granted.24 Thus, Ayaan Hirsi Ali and Condoleezza Rice have been disinvited and heckled at academic events, and they have been attacked by the very groups that claim to defend women of color against assaultive speech. But white progressive allies who champion the correct ideology—who “check their privilege”—are allowed to speak, albeit as social inferiors who must defer to their more authentic superiors.



In short, to advocate a position contrary to the orthodox ideology is de facto racist, regardless of the speaker’s reasoning or motivation; but progressives are given broad immunity to engage in what would otherwise be considered hate speech against their political opponents regardless of race, class, and gender. Again, mere partisan intolerance of unpopular opinion gets framed as an exception for speech that somehow constitutes violence. Yet, such putatively hateful or violent speech is not identified by its motivation or effect, because analogous speech that targets dissenting opinion is immune. What matters is whether the speech serves the social justice ideology or not. That is the realization of Marcuse’s “liberating” practice of intolerance, an overtly partisan goal carried out subversively.



In fact, the popular conflation of speech and violence is the inevitable consequence of the dogma that hateful speech is beyond the pale of free speech immunity. Here is the crux of the matter. The idea that opinions can _wound_ , that they can _trigger_ traumatic emotional episodes—which lead to (often violent) behavior for which the victim is not responsible—and that people should be _safe_ from offensive views amounts to a substantive and dangerous claim that masquerades as innocuous and benign. The practical effect of banning hate speech is to present a new weapon to the antagonists of free speech: to argue that some doctrine is beyond the pale of toleration, one merely needs to claim that it constitutes hate speech. If putatively harmful or hateful speech is banned, then those who wish to suppress unorthodox opinion will attempt to frame it as hateful and violent. That is just what we now see playing out on campus.



Consider the degree to which political argument gets couched in terms that censure the motives of the opposition. We can put entirely to the side the question of the merits of various positions on gay rights. The relevant issue is semantic: positions held to be anti‐​gay are now almost universally called _homophobic_. That usage is highly tendentious, implying that the only basis for opposition to the legalization of same‐​sex marriage, or so‐​called bathroom equality, is the irrational fear of homosexuality. That is the nature of a phobia. The same rhetorical ploy is now being taken up by people who use the term _Islamo_ _phobi_ _a_ as their analogue to anti‐​Semitism. Moreover, what can be done with fear can also be done with hate. When hatefulness becomes the criterion of speech that is beyond the pale, subject to either legal or social sanction, then that criterion creates a powerful incentive to label one’s opponents’ motives as hateful. It should be no surprise to see this happening.



The great irony of these developments is that they buttress both of the liberal arguments for freedom of speech, whether founded in natural rights or utility. The natural rights argument needed to show that the claim to a right of freedom of speech—properly understood, as the right to profess and discuss any opinion or sentiment, regardless of its truth or consequences—is better justified than any conflicting rights claim. The crucial point to notice is that the attempt to control the moral ecology of a campus (or the country) by banning putative hate speech amounts to just such a claim: that students (or citizens) have a right to a safe space free from opinions and sentiments that they find offensive. Note, too, that since it is impossible for everyone to be protected from ideas and emotions they find abhorrent, this right can be granted only unequally—to some, not to all. And no one proposes to grant the right to a safe space to dissenters. Thus, the claim of a right to a safe space free from hurtful opinions undermines not only the freedoms of conscience but also the principle of equality of rights. This point does not vindicate the natural rights argument for freedom of speech, but it shows that it rests on a much stronger foundation than does the illiberal counterargument.



The utilitarian argument for freedom of speech needed to show that attempts to promote the common good by circumventing individual rights would be so prone to abuse as to have worse consequences than a doctrine that tolerates all opinion and sentiment without exception. That argument gets even stronger support from the ongoing assault on unpopular speech in academia. The cognitive biases that undermine knowledge—conformism, group polarization, confirmation bias, and epistemic closure—are all exacerbated by the idea that certain opinions constitute “microaggressions” that should be prohibited and subject to sanction. A recent list of such heretical ideas approved by the University of California warned professors against claiming, for example, that America is the land of opportunity, that the most qualified person should get the job, and that affirmative action is racist. By officially discouraging the profession and discussion of these ideas, the university shuns adverse discussion and undermines the mission of teaching its students how to form their beliefs in a manner worthy of intelligent beings. Instead, it establishes an orthodoxy of political opinion and encourages the punishment of dissenting opinion as racist or otherwise hateful and, hence, unworthy of counterargument. That orthodoxy makes political opposition tantamount to heresy.



What is more, such intolerance creates an incentive for hypersensitivity, since it empowers campus activists—again exclusively leftist activists—to suppress dissent. The multiculturalist assimilation of speech with violence, alongside the postmodern and progressive arguments that preceded it, amounts to an invitation to turn opposition into abhorrence and to exaggerate emotional trauma. This movement encourages the cultivation of intellectual vices that are antithetical to an intellectually diverse society by granting power to the thin‐​skinned and the hotheaded—or at any rate to those most ready to claim injury or to threaten violence. And it does so subversively, by pretending to enforce norms of civility and tolerance, while doing violence to the classically liberal ideals of a freethinking and intellectually diverse university.

2\. This essay endorses norms of academic freedom and non‐​indoctrination, in line with not just the classically liberal approach but also common assumptions about the mission of academia (at least outside of religious institutions, which advertise their alternative missions), and to illustrate ways in which our universities are increasingly deviating from those norms. That is not to say that private universities must be legally required to adhere to free speech. If Harvard were to declare itself a Progressive institution dedicated to social justice, even at the expense of academic freedom, then they should not be barred from doing so. That would be a bad idea, but—putting to the side complex issues about tax exemptions and the like—plenty of bad ideas should not be legally prohibited.

6\. It is important to differentiate between legal rights, which are established procedurally, and moral rights that purport to be independent and prior to the law. Natural rights claims (like “human rights”) are about moral rights.



7\. The term _liberal_ used to describe a coherent set of beliefs and values centered around liberty, which stressed individual rights and personal responsibility. Even in 1973, Milton Friedman described himself simply as a liberal, in _Capitalism and Freedom_ , without fear of massive misunderstanding. But that semantic battle is lost; outside of a few circles, one now needs to refer to _classical_ liberalism to refer to this position rather than generic progressivism.



8\. Ironically, the metaphor was inapt from its conception, as the case that spawned the cliché, _Schenk v. United States_ , concerned anti‐​war protesters in World War I who circulated pamphlets opposing the draft. Nevertheless, the point remains that the intentional provocation of a panic, when it constitutes a clear and present danger, is not protected speech under the First Amendment.

"UNIONDALE, N. Y.  —   Seeking to meet growing electric demand in the Hamptons with renewable energy, the Long Island Power Authority approved the nation’s largest offshore wind farm on Wednesday, set for the waters between the eastern tip of Long Island and Martha’s Vineyard. The farm, with as many as 15 turbines capable of powering 50, 000 average homes over all, is the first of several planned by the developer, Deepwater Wind. It will be in a    parcel, with room for as many as 200 turbines, that the company is leasing from the federal government. “It is the largest project to date, but it will not be the last project,” the power authority’s chief executive, Thomas Falcone, said before the vote as a crowd of supporters erupted in whoops and applause. Wind power has struggled to take off in the United States, but the Long Island project signals that the   promise of a new,   source of electricity is poised to become part of the national energy mix. It has been given new life by New York’s push to meet Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s goal of drawing 50 percent of the state’s power from renewable sources by 2030. That goal includes 2. 4 gigawatts of offshore wind, enough to power 1. 25 million homes. It is the largest commitment to offshore wind in the country and is part of the state’s way of showing the nascent industry it is serious about developing the resource. “This project will not only provide a new, reliable source of clean energy but will also create   jobs, continue our efforts to combat climate change and help preserve our environment,” Mr. Cuomo said Wednesday in a statement, two weeks after he publicly called for the power authority to approve the proposal. The project’s cost was projected at $1 billion but is now expected to be $740 million. Deepwater plans to finance the project with loans and equity investments, according to Jeffrey Grybowski, the company’s chief executive. Mr. Grybowski expressed confidence that the project would qualify for an investment tax credit, set to phase out at the end of 2019, that is worth 24 percent of the development’s cost. Whether it does, however, could be open to interpretation by the Treasury. The turbines, each roughly 600 feet tall, would be connected to a substation in East Hampton by a   undersea cable. The town has a goal of its own: meeting all of its electric demand with renewable energy by 2020. Other offshore wind projects, notably one off Cape Cod, have encountered opposition over their effect on ocean views. But Deepwater has said the turbines supplying East Hampton would not be visible from Montauk, on the tip of Long Island, and would barely be visible from Martha’s Vineyard, 15 miles away. The approval comes six weeks after the nation’s only other functioning offshore   farm  —   a Deepwater project in Rhode Island state waters off Block Island  —   began serving customers on the grid. Big multinational developers like Statoil and Dong Energy are also investing in the business, snapping up leases for ocean parcels with the aim of competing for utility contracts in Maryland, Massachusetts and New York. The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority is putting together an offshore wind master plan to guide development, including a swath south of the Rockaways. The projects have all faced some opposition, some of it from commercial fisheries concerned that the turbines, attached to the seafloor, will disrupt their businesses and consumers worried about higher electricity prices. The power authority, which plans to buy all of the Long Island farm’s output over 20 years, says the cost is about the same as its other renewable energy projects, about 16 cents a  . Its average electricity price is 7. 5 cents a   so the project is expected to add $1. 19 a month to the average customer bill. No opposition was in evidence as the authority voted at a public meeting at its headquarters here. Several supporters praised the proposal as a way to move the electric system off fossil fuels to slow climate change, and as an engine for jobs. But much remains to be done before those benefits materialize. First, the developers must study and map the ocean floor to determine precisely where and how to anchor each turbine, and then go through the federal and state permitting processes. The farm is to begin transmitting power by the end of 2022, so Deepwater would need to start construction no later than 2020. “We think that thousands of megawatts are going to be built off the coast of the United States in the coming decades,” Mr. Grybowski said. “It’s an enormous clean energy resource. It’s easy for us to tap into it, but we need projects to get from essentially one project to these thousands of megawatts. ”"
"Now that Joaquín Guzmán Loera, the crime lord known as El Chapo, has been extradited from Mexico and has pleaded not guilty in Brooklyn to charges of running the planet’s biggest drug empire, his prosecution will enter a crucial phase  —   provided, of course, he does not manage to tunnel free from the   jail in Manhattan where he is being held. Two chief questions will define what comes next: Will Mr. Guzmán decide to go to trial? And if he does, what sort of defense will he mount to counter what appears to be a Matterhorn of evidence against him? When Robert L. Capers, the United States attorney in Brooklyn, outlined the government’s case against Mr. Guzmán at a news conference on Friday, he seemed unable to disguise a sly smile of satisfaction. After all, that morning, Mr. Capers’s office had filed a memorandum that set forth in exhaustive detail the cinematic story of Mr. Guzmán’s rise from a teenage marijuana farmer to an international kingpin who armed himself with a diamond encrusted pistol. It further noted that dozens of witnesses were lined up to testify and corroborate what prosecutors described as extensive secret recordings in which Mr. Guzmán discussed drug transactions. Several lawyers who have represented drug lords in the past said that the aggressive tenor of the memo suggested that, at least for now, federal prosecutors were serious about trying Mr. Guzmán and were unlikely to offer him a deal to plead guilty to lesser charges. Mr. Guzmán, moreover, is facing life in prison on a sweeping count of running a continuing criminal enterprise. So there was no real downside, the lawyers said, for him to fight the government’s case. “The government has made it clear that they’re going full bore with this,” said David O. Markus, who negotiated the 2006 guilty pleas for Gilberto and Miguel Rodríguez Orejuela, Colombian brothers who helped found the Cali cartel. “For El Chapo, if there’s no offer on the table and it’s life if you go to trial and life or near it if you plead guilty, it’s pretty easy  —   he’ll go to trial. ” Before Mr. Guzmán has to make that decision, however, a number of complicated issues are certain to arise. Given that he has been indicted not only in Brooklyn, but also in six other federal districts, his legal team is likely to question whether he is being prosecuted in the appropriate jurisdiction. They could also attack the manner in which he was sent to New York, some lawyers said, casting doubt on whether he was properly extradited. Then there is the question of his hiring a private lawyer. For the moment, Mr. Guzmán is being represented by two seasoned public defenders, Michael Schneider and Michelle Gelernt. While there is a   narco bar of lawyers, mainly in Florida and Texas, who regularly handle cartel cases, many of them are already representing people who may appear as witnesses at Mr. Guzmán’s trial. Further complicating matters, the federal government has said that it wants to seize $14 billion in profits that Mr. Guzmán was said to have made while running the Sinaloa cartel, leaving his financial situation unclear. “Many good criminal defense lawyers may shy away from the case not only because of the conduct that’s been charged, but because it’s hard to get paid if the government argues that all his money is   tainted,” said Benjamin Brafman, one of New York City’s top defense lawyers. But if Mr. Guzmán does end up before a jury, Mr. Brafman and other lawyers said that he could borrow a tactic from the manifold Mafia trials that have taken place in Brooklyn and defend himself by attacking the credibility of the government’s witnesses. According to the prosecution’s memo, “a large coterie of cooperating witnesses”  —   among them, Colombian cartel members, Mexican couriers and United   distributors  —   is ready to testify about every aspect of Mr. Guzmán’s organization, including bribes paid to politicians and murders of rival drug dealers and government and law enforcement officials. “It’s inconceivable to me that these people don’t have baggage of their own,” Mr. Brafman said, “if, indeed, they were involved in the organization for a long time. ” The case of Vicente Zambada Niebla, the son of Ismael Zambada García, who long served as Mr. Guzmán’s top lieutenant in the Sinaloa cartel, offers another possible avenue of defense. Mr. Zambada was arrested by the Mexican authorities in 2009 and extradited to Chicago, where he was poised to stand trial as the cartel’s chief logistics officer for importing drugs into that city. But a few years into the case his lawyers suddenly claimed that he could not be prosecuted in the United States because he had been secretly working as an informant for the Drug Enforcement Administration. Though the government subsequently acknowledged that D. E. A. agents had in fact met with Mr. Zambada, it denied that it had engaged with him in any quid pro quo. Nonetheless, in 2014, the D. E. A. announced that Mr. Zambada would not stand trial because he had pleaded guilty to trafficking charges and was working as a government informant. The possibility that Mr. Guzmán might also become an informant is a complicated one. Some lawyers said that because he was accused in court papers of kidnapping, torture and causing the deaths of thousands of people, it would be hard to imagine the government allowing him to cooperate  —   unless, perhaps, he had reliable and damning information on   Mexican officials. Others said they found that prospect dubious because of Mr. Guzmán’s reputation as a Robin   hero in his homeland. “He has this mythic legacy behind him,” said W. Rob Heroy, a lawyer for Carlos Ramon   a Mexican who pleaded guilty in 2014 to producing and distributing heroin in the United States, much of it in and around Charlotte, N. C. “Maybe the government would want him as an informant, but I just can’t see El Chapo getting done with all of that and then going to work at a Cinnabon in Omaha. ”"

The impacts on agriculture of the CPRS1 in its present form, will be many facetted with major, minor, direct, indirect and subtle effects.
A decision is to be made in 2013 about including agriculture as a ‘covered sector’ in 2015. The Government is ‘disposed’ to include agriculture, which means that it is very likely to be included, and will then become subject to obtaining/buying Carbon Credits, or as they are to be known under the CPRS, Australian Emission Units (AEU’s) to cover the emissions that are calculated as being emitted.
Some AEU’s may be initially given to farmers, or may have to be purchased at auction, or at a fixed price determined by the government.
In any event it is proposed to reduce the number of AEU’s regularly (such as annually) to reduce Australia’s total emissions to meet the target it has set in the CPRS by 2020 and 2050.
The implications of this decision will be costly and dramatic.

"**A former employee of the UK's Hong Kong consulate has told the BBC that he was tortured in China and accused of inciting political unrest in the city.**
Simon Cheng, a Hong Kong citizen who worked for the UK government for almost two years, was detained for 15 days on a trip to mainland China in August.
""I was shackled, blindfolded and hooded,"" the 29-year-old tells me.
UK government sources say they believe his claims - of being beaten and forced to sign confessions - are credible.
Following our interview, the British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab summoned the Chinese ambassador.
""We are outraged by the disgraceful mistreatment that Mr Cheng faced when he was in detention in mainland China... and we've made clear that we expect the Chinese authorities to review and hold to account those responsible,"" Mr Raab told the BBC.
But on Wednesday a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson told the BBC they ""absolutely cannot accept the UK government's interference in this case"" - and would in return summon the UK ambassador to ""express their opposition and anger"".
""We hope the UK will be prudent and stop interfering in Hong Kong and in China's domestic affairs because it will, eventually, only harm the UK's own interests,"" the spokesperson added.
Mr Cheng's raises questions for both the Chinese and the UK governments.
The claims he makes - including that he saw other Hongkongers in Chinese custody - are likely to fuel protesters' fears that their city's freedoms are being eroded under Chinese rule.
""They said they work for the secret service and that there are no human rights,"" he tells me. ""Then they started the torture.""
As a trade and investment officer at the UK consulate, Simon Cheng's particular brief was to drum up interest in investing in Scotland among the Chinese business community.
It required him to travel frequently to mainland China.
But in June, with Hong Kong engulfed in mass demonstrations, Mr Cheng volunteered for an additional role.
""The British Consulate instructed staff to collect information about the status of the protests,"" he says.
As a supporter of the pro-democracy movement he found it easy to blend in and, with the consent of the consulate, he signed up to some of the social media groups through which the protesters co-ordinated their actions.
Paid overtime for the information he gathered, he began reporting back what he saw to his colleagues.
His task, both Mr Cheng and UK government sources insist, was not to direct events in any way but to purely observe - the kind of civil society monitoring work many embassies do.
But China had already begun to accuse the UK of meddling in Hong Kong, with British politicians becoming increasing vocal in their support for the protesters.
On 8 August, with emails still on his phone linking him to that work observing the protests, he was sent by the consulate to a business conference in the Chinese city of Shenzhen.
He didn't know it, but his life was about to change forever.
Although China has ruled Hong Kong for more than 20 years, the border between the city and the mainland still looks and feels like an international boundary.
The ""one country two systems"" principle - that the protesters say they are fighting to preserve - is meant to ensure that Hong Kong retains control over most of its affairs, including its borders.
But Simon Cheng was about to discover for himself the blurred edges of that legal and political framework.
Since the opening of the Hong Kong-Shenzhen high-speed rail link last year, a new border post has been placed inside West Kowloon station, in the heart of Hong Kong.
It is deeply controversial: Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement views the presence of the Chinese police, manning the Chinese side, as an unwelcome extension of Chinese authority.
It was here they stopped Simon Cheng, returning from his business trip.
He was put on a train, transported back to Shenzhen and handed over, he says, to three plainclothes officers from China's National Security Police.
Raising his arms above his head Mr Cheng shows me how he was hung up from the chain linking the handcuffs on his wrists.
The questions focused on his involvement in the protests with the aim, he says, of forcing him to confess to fomenting unrest on behalf of the British state.
""They wanted to know what role the UK had in the Hong Kong protests - they asked what support, money and equipment we were giving to the protesters.""
He says he was made to hold stress positions - squatting against a wall for example - for hours on end, and beaten if he moved.
""They would beat the bony parts, like my ankles... or any vulnerable part.""
He claims he was subjected to sleep deprivation, with his interrogators forcing him to sing the Chinese national anthem to keep himself awake.
And, he believes, he was not the only Hongkonger undergoing such treatment.
""I saw a bunch of Hong Kong people getting arrested and interrogated. I heard someone speak in Cantonese saying: 'Raise your hands up - you raised the flags in the protest didn't you?'""
From a large pile of more than 1,000 photographs of Hong Kong protesters, he says, he was told to jot down the names and political affiliations of anyone he recognised.
""The secret police clearly stated that batches after batches of Hong Kong protesters had been caught, delivered and detained in mainland China.""
Strapped to a chair and held by his hair, he says they tried to force him to open his mobile phone using the facial recognition function.
Once they'd gained access, they printed off the emails detailing the information he'd passed to the UK consulate about the protests.
""I told them I want to make it 100% clear, the UK didn't assign resources or help with the protests,"" he tells me.
But it was no use. Eventually, they made him record two video confessions, he says, one for the ""betrayal of the motherland"" and another for ""soliciting prostitution"".
The detention of a local employee of a foreign embassy or consulate is a relatively rare event.
The last high-profile case involving the UK was the arrest in 2009 of a number of Iranian employees at the British embassy in Tehran. They were accused of playing a significant role in that year's violent demonstrations - an accusation that finds echoes in Simon Cheng's account.
As in his own case, locally-employed staff usually have no diplomatic protection, potentially making them soft targets for intelligence gathering.
But Mr Cheng may have been targeted for other reasons.
He tells me he had a mainland Chinese friend who'd been arrested for taking part in the Hong Kong protests and was now on bail there.
During his business trip to Shenzhen, without the knowledge of the UK consulate, Mr Cheng had met the relatives of this friend to collect money for his living expenses.
Any mainlander known to have joined the pro-democracy demonstrations would be at risk of being placed under Chinese surveillance.
Although collecting money for a friend in legal difficulty is unlikely to constitute a crime, even in China, it could well have placed Mr Cheng under suspicion too.
I ask him what he thinks is the most likely reason for his detention - his position at the UK consulate, or his friendship with this mainland Chinese protester?
""Until now I have no idea,"" he replies. ""But I think both factors could be part of the reason.""
Alongside our interview, Mr Cheng has published his own detailed account of what happened to him.
In it, he says that on the 11th day of his detention his treatment suddenly improved, a date that he says coincides with the first international media reports about his disappearance.
UK government sources say that, behind the scenes, intense diplomatic activity was already under way to try to secure his release.
Of China's only public version of events - the allegation that he was placed in 15 days administrative detention for soliciting prostitution - Mr Cheng is dismissive.
""It was a tactic for secretly and arbitrarily incarcerating me for an even longer period, without interference from third parties.""
In China, administrative detention is a penalty that can be imposed by the police, acting with no judicial oversight. And, he suggests, the circumstances of his arrest appear unusual.
Allegations of soliciting prostitution are normally dealt with in China as a routine matter by the local police. They are far less likely to be the concern of the Chinese border authorities in West Kowloon station.
Mr Cheng's written statement also mentions that, before his arrest, he stopped in Shenzhen for a massage.
I ask him directly if he paid for sex.
""I don't want to focus on the question of whether I solicited a prostitute, because that's exactly what they want,"" he replies.
""So, I just want to state clearly that I did nothing regrettable to the people I cherish and love.""
Whatever the reasons behind the decision to release him, he says it came with a warning.
""They stated that if I receive media interviews and speak out [about] anything other than 'soliciting prostitution' publicly, I will be taken back to mainland China from Hong Kong.""
The UK's Hong Kong consulate has since reviewed, and tightened up, its guidelines for local staff travelling on work trips to the Chinese mainland.
Simon Cheng has told the BBC that he believes it is too dangerous for him to return to Hong Kong.
Initially, he was so concerned about his safety, he refused to allow the UK government to issue a statement condemning the way he'd been treated.
He was also given little choice but to resign because the UK government now sees him as a security risk following his long interrogation at the hands of the Chinese secret police.
But UK sources say he has been provided with support, including a two-year working visa for the UK.
""Our hearts are with Simon Cheng and his family,"" Dominic Raab, the British Foreign Secretary, told the BBC.
""From the outset my overriding concern has been to make sure that he's taken care of properly and he gets the support that he needs.""
But Mr Cheng's written statement suggests he does not see the protection he's being offered as adequate and, he says, he's now seeking asylum anywhere he can feel safe.
While he faces an uncertain future, the political and diplomatic ramifications of his extraordinary testimony are likely to be significant.
The claims he makes will feed into the already frayed relations between the UK and China over the subject of Hong Kong.
China will face questions about the use of torture in its headlong search for proof of foreign interference.
The British government will face questions about whether it could have done more to protect Mr Cheng as well as its treatment of him since.
As for Hong Kong's protesters - who began their fight against an extradition bill that would have allowed suspects to be sent to China - Simon Cheng's story will confirm one thing above all else: that there is indeed much to fear from a justice system so at odds with their own."
"George Orwell’s classic book “1984,” about a dystopian future where critical thought is suppressed under a totalitarian regime, has seen a surge in sales this month, rising to the top of the Amazon   list in the United States and leading its publisher to have tens of thousands of new copies printed. Craig Burke, the publicity director at Penguin USA, said that the publisher had ordered 75, 000 new copies of the book this week and that it was considering another reprint. “We’ve seen a big bump in sales,” Mr. Burke said. He added that the rise “started over the weekend and hit hyperactive” on Tuesday and Wednesday morning. Since Friday, the book has reached a 9, 500 percent increase in sales, he said. He said demand began to lift on Sunday, shortly after the interview Kellyanne Conway, an adviser to Donald J. Trump, gave on “Meet the Press. ” In defending a false claim by the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, that Mr. Trump had attracted the “largest audience ever to witness an inauguration,” Ms. Conway used a turn of phrase that struck some observers as similar to the dystopian world of “1984. ” When asked on NBC’s “Meet the Press” why Mr. Spicer had said something that was provably false, Ms. Conway replied airily, “Don’t be so dramatic. ” Mr. Spicer, she said, “gave alternative facts. ” In the novel, the term “newspeak” refers to language in which independent thought, or “unorthodox” political ideas, have been eliminated. “Doublethink” is defined as “reality control. ” On social media and elsewhere on Sunday, the book’s readers made a connection between Ms. Conway’s comments and Orwell’s language, and the attention on the book “kind of took a life of its own,” Mr. Burke said. The dictionary publisher   described the interview as “fraught with epistemological tension. ” The dictionary also reported that searches for the word “fact” spiked after Ms. Conway’s comments, and then, as an apparent reminder, tweeted the dictionary’s definition. Even outside the United States, interest in “1984” has grown. So far this year, sales have risen by 20 percent in Britain and Australia compared to the same period a year ago, according to Jess Harrison, a   editor at Penguin Books. The novel is usually a   she said, and it sold 100, 000 copies last year in   countries outside the United States and Canada. “But we’ve definitely seen an uplift” in sales, she added. Dystopian novels are “chiming with people,” Ms. Harrison said, adding that “The Man in the High Castle” by Philip K. Dick, an alternative history in which the Nazis defeated America to win World War II, is also selling well. A television series based on Mr. Dick’s novel is now in its second season at Amazon. Penguin also published Sinclair Lewis’s “It Can’t Happen Here,” about the rise of a demagogue, last Friday in Britain for the first time since 1935, “and we’re already on to our third printing,” Mr. Burke said. On Wednesday, that book was also ranking among Amazon’s best sellers, as was Aldous Huxley’s “Brave New World,” another dystopian classic. Prof. Stefan Collini, a professor of intellectual history and an expert on Orwell at the University of Cambridge, said that readers see a natural parallel between the book and the way Mr. Trump and his staff have distorted facts. “Everyone remembers ‘1984’ as containing various parodies of official distortions,” he said. “That kind of unreality that is propagated as reality is what people feel reminded of, and that’s why they keep coming back. ”"

Readers may remember this Josh classic:

In a December 16th Podcast with “Forecast A podcast about climate science and climate scientists” run by Michael White, Nature’s editor for climate science, Dr. Gavin Schmidt makes a stunning admission while demonstrating his own lack of self awareness when it comes to climate debate. White writes:
We talked extensively about science-government interactions, and some of Gavin’s many  Kafkaesque experiences. In the end, attempts at government muzzling and micromanagement of science communication comes across as impractical, appalling, and … a bit comical.
But it’s not all bad. The complete government failure to engage in any sort of response and discussion of climate-related science fiction like The Day After Tomorrow led Gavin to participate in the RealClimate blog.
Here, courtesy of Tom Nelson, is what is surprising, throwing tree rings under the bus. It’s actually closer to 59:00 when he says this.

Yes, he’s right. Mann’s questionable work pretty much amounts to nothing, as we’ve been saying for years. A political tool is all it ever was, one that no longer has much clout.
Gavin thinks it is “quite likely” that seas will rise 1 meter or more by 2100 at about 31:20
Then there’s Schmidt’s statement: “I do try and advocate for a higher level of conversation”. Dr. Schmidt seems to forget that when given the opportunity he advocates for, he took the cowardly approach and refused to be on-set with Dr. Roy Spencer.
So much for high level discourse.

                                                                          Graph adapted from Climate4you
Last week, Edinburgh and Day (2016) used historical monitoring records to conclude that “the [Antarctic sea ice] levels in the early 1900s were in fact similar to today“.   Apparently this was a surprising finding for those who assume anthropogenic greenhouse gases largely determine net changes in polar sea ice.
Perhaps it may also be surprising for those who only focus on the 1979-to-present satellite era to learn that Arctic sea ice has also remained essentially unchanged since the 1930s and 1940s too, and is overall still quite high relative to recent centennial- and millennial-scale historical periods.  Even for the last few decades, the trends are not unusual.
For example, the IPCC referenced NOAA satellite data that extended back to 1972, not 1979, in the first UN report (1990).  It showed that there had been a slight increasing trend in sea ice for 1972-1990 due to the low extent recorded during the early 1970s, and the very high extent in the late 1970s, when the current satellite datasets begin.  Now, the IPCC (and NOAA, NSIDC) discard the 1972-1978 data from the sea ice record, instead using 1979 as the starting point, or the year with the highest sea ice extent since the early 20th century.  This way, the decline in sea ice extent to the present can be steepened considerably in modern graphics.
IPCC FAR (1990):

Between 1990 and 2006, Arctic sea ice declined rapidly.  Since 2006, however, the sea ice decline has undergone a pause, as shown in NSIDC data (using WoodForTrees.org interactive graphs):

                                                   Graph generated using WoodForTrees.org
Including the 1972-1978 trend with the 1979-2016 anomaly data (with added trend line) looks like this:
University of Illinois graph:

For the early 20th century, there was a dramatic decline in Arctic sea ice between the 1920s and 1940s that was concomitant with the as-warm-as-present Arctic surface temperatures (top graph).  After this abrupt warming trend ended, the Arctic cooled for several decades and a subsequent increase in sea ice occurred through the late 1970s.  Hoffert and Flanney (1985) furnish a graph with recorded sea ice trends for 1920-1975.
Hoffert and Flannery, 1985

Introduction: As described m ore fully in the accompanying state-o f-the-art report on the Detecting the Climatic Effects of Increasing Carbon Dioxide (see Chapter 4 by Wigley et al. 1985), there is no clear indication of a monotonic warming over this period [1880-1980], as would be anticipated from the observed build up of CO2 in the atmosphere. Instead, these data sets indicate a complex picture including interannual variability and, perhaps, some systematic trends. Indeed, the global temperatures seem to have increased from 1885- 1935, and the extent of Arctic sea ice decreased from 1925-1945. This was followed, however, by a leveling off and then a subsequent decrease in temperature.


If we were to add the IPCC’s 1972-1990 trend data to the Hoffert and Flannery (1985) graph of the early 20th century, we would see a clear oscillatory pattern in Arctic sea ice (below), not a linear trend that aligns with the increase in anthropogenic CO2 emissions.  In fact, Arctic sea ice experienced a rather steep recovery from the 1940s lows to the late 1970s highs, during the same period that anthropogenic CO2 emissions rates were quadrupling in intensity.   The pause in Arctic sea ice decline (since 2006) also does not correlate with the rapid increase in anthropogenic CO2 emissions during this period.

Extending the sea ice record back centuries, we also see that there is nothing unusual about the recent Arctic sea ice extent changes.
Zhang et al., 2015

Durantou et al., 2012

Sea surface temperature [Arctic Ocean] between ∼ AD 1885–1935 are warmer by up to 3°C with respect to the average modern temperature at the coring site. For the period ∼ AD 1887–1945, reconstructed sea ice cover values are on average 8.3 months per year which is 1.1 months per year lower than the modern values.


Moore et al., 2001

Summer temperatures at Donard Lake [Canadian Arctic] over the past 1250 yrs averaged 2.9 °C.  At the beginning of the 13th century, Donard Lake experienced one of the largest climatic transitions in over a millennium. Average summer temperatures rose rapidly by nearly 2 °C from 1195–1220 AD [+0.80 C per decade], ending in the warmest decade in the record (~4.3 °C).    A dramatic warming event is seen around the same time (~1160 AD) in a tree-ring width record from Fennoscandia (Briffa et al., 1990). The rapid warming at Donard Lake was followed by a period of extended warmth, with average summer temperatures of 3.4 °C. This time of warm summer temperatures corresponds to the period when Thule Inuit moved into the Canadian Arctic from Alaska using open boats and hunting whale. A ~150–200 yr period of increased temperature around the same time is also seen in historical records of mild conditions allowing the expansion of settlements in Greenland (McGovern, 1991), and radiocarbon-dated records of glacial advance and retreat from numerous glaciers throughout the Kenai peninsula in Alaska (Wiles & Calkin, 1995), as well as humifaction records from Irish peat bogs (Blackford & Chambers, 1995).


H.H. Lamb (1982) “Climate, History, and the Modern World” (book)

Ran et al., 2010

Finally, many scientists acknowledge that Arctic sea ice trends are naturally determined, and anthropogenic CO2 emissions have little to do with decadal-scale variations.  Below are just a few examples.
Ohashi and Tanaka, 2010

Since the decadal variation of the AO is recognized as the natural variability of the global atmosphere, it is shown that both of decadal variabilities before and after 1989 in the Arctic can be mostly explained by the natural variability of the AO not by the external response due to the human activity.

Sha et al., 2016

Solar forcing as an important trigger for West Greenland sea-ice variability over the last millennium … Here, we use diatom assemblages from a marine sediment core collected from the West Greenland shelf to reconstruct changes in sea-ice cover over the last millennium. The proxy-based reconstruction demonstrates a generally strong link between changes in sea-ice cover and solar variability during the last millennium. Weaker (or stronger) solar forcing may result in the increase (or decrease) in sea-ice cover west of Greenland. In addition, model simulations show that variations in solar activity not only affect local sea-ice formation, but also control the sea-ice transport from the Arctic Ocean through a sea-ice–ocean–atmosphere feedback mechanism.

Parker and Ollier, 2015

A better understanding of the future climate pattern developments in the Arctic may only follow a better reconstruction of the past patterns of natural oscillations and the determination of the forcing and the resulting oscillations occurred in the climate parameters over different time scales. The proposed information for the past demonstrates the Walsh & Chapman reconstruction claiming a flat sea ice 1870 to 1950 is too simple. The Arctic sea ice experienced a drastic reduction that was phased with warming temperatures 1923 to 1940. This reduction was followed by a sharp cooling and sea ice recovery. This permits us to also conclude that very likely the Arctic sea ice extent also has a quasi-60 years’ oscillation. The recognition of a quasi-60 year’s oscillation in the sea ice extent of the Arctic similar to the oscillation of the temperatures and the other climate indices may permit us to separate the natural from the anthropogenic forcing of the Arctic sea ice. The heliosphere and the Earth’s magnetosphere may have much stronger influence on the climate patterns on Earth including the Arctic sea ices than has been thought.

Lessen and Thejll, 2005

Multi-decadal variation of the East Greenland Sea-Ice Extent: AD 1500-2000 … The extent of ice in the North Atlantic varies in time with time scales stretching to centennial, and the cause of these variations is discussed. We consider the Koch ice index which describes the amount of ice sighted from Iceland, in the period 1150 to 1983 AD. This measure of ice extent is a non-linear and curtailed measure of the amount of ice in the Greenland Sea, but gives an overall view of the amounts of ice there through more than 800 years.  [W]e find that the recently reported retreat of the ice in the Greenland Sea  may be related to the termination of the so-called Little Ice Age in the early twentieth century. We also look at the approximately 80 year variability of the Koch [sea ice] index and compare it to the similar periodicity found in the solar cycle length, which is a measure of solar activity. A close correlation (R=0.67) of high significance (0.5 % probability of a chance occurrence) is found between the two patterns, suggesting a link from solar activity to the Arctic Ocean climate. … The ’low frequency oscillation’ that dominated the ice export through the Fram Strait as well as the extension of the sea-ice in the Greenland Sea and Davis Strait in the twentieth century may therefore be regarded as part of a pattern that has existed through at least four centuries. The pattern is a natural feature, related to varying solar activity. The considerations of the impact of natural sources of variability on arctic ice extent are of relevance for concerns that the current withdrawal of ice may entirely be due to human activity. Apparently, a considerable fraction of the current withdrawal could be a natural occurrence.

"Australia’s EPA (Environmental Protection Authority) has been negligent in listing carbon dioxide (CO2) as a pollutant without conducting an independent public review of the scientific evidence to support that decision.
The Garnaut Doomsday report, the CSIRO Scare forecasts, and the Cap-N-Tax Scheme of Senator Wong are all based on faulty foundations. Like trusting children following the Pied Piper, Senator Wong follows the EPA, which follows CSIRO and Garnaut, who follow the US EPA, which follows the IPCC, which follows the Pied Piper of Gore, whose movie has been found to contain many untruths. Only a few key people in this Conga Line of gullibles know where they are going and why. Even fewer have checked the scientific basis of the Global Warming Theory.

They are all following the completely outdated IPCC AR4 report. This report was published in 2007 but relies on scientific papers at least 3 years out of date, and some such as the NAS 1979 study are 30 years old.
Now a critical draft report has emerged from inside the US EPA. It was written by very competent EPA staff, warning that organisation that their classification of CO2 as a pollutant was too heavily based on the latest IPCC report “which is at best three years out of date in a rapidly changing field.” This EPA report has been suppressed for months.
The comprehensive 98 page report details six areas where important new findings demand re-assessment of the EPA ruling. These include the end of the warming trend that is now obvious, the gross failure of IPCC forecasts of temperature and CO2 emissions, the lack of correlation between CO2 and temperature, and the “strong association between solar/sunspots/irradiance and global temperature fluctuations.”
The report also finds that the assumption of positive feedback from water vapour that underlies all global warming models is “not supported by empirical evidence and the feedback is actually negative.”
Finally, in a statement that demolishes the key argument for the Cap-N-Tax Scheme, this suppressed EPA report notes: “Changes in greenhouse gas concentrations appear to have so little effect that it is difficult to find any effect in the satellite temperature record, which started in 1978”.
The emergence of this critical report from within the EPA citadel, indicates the urgency for Australia to follow New Zealand, put the Cap-N-Tax Scheme on indefinite hold, and conduct a thorough independent enquiry into the basis for the Australian EPA actions which attempt to demonise CO2.
The best evidence before us now, supported completely by this in-house thinking in the US EPA, is that Australia’s EPA was hasty and negligent in classing CO2, the valuable and harmless Gas of Life, as a pollutant.
This decision should be reversed until an independent enquiry is held.

"How could Mexico inflict the most damage on the United States? In normal times this question would not be top of mind for Mexican policy makers. Mexican governments over the last   have consistently pushed back against the nation’s historical resentment toward the United States, hoping to build a more cooperative relationship with its overbearing northern neighbor. But these aren’t normal times. As President Trump prepares the opening gambit in his project to either renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement or pull out, Mexico’s most important strategic goal is narrowing to one word: deterrence. It must convince Mr. Trump that if he blows up the trade agreement on which Mexico has staked its hopes of development, by weaving its economy ever more closely into that of the United States, the United States will suffer, too. The critical question is whether Mexico’s threat will be convincing. Mexico’s main challenge as it confronts a hostile Trump administration is the enormous asymmetry of the bilateral relationship. Ending Nafta would hurt the United States: Six million American jobs depend on exports to Mexico, according to Mexican officials. But to Mexico, it could prove devastating. Mexico has relied on the pact to draw foreign capital into the country, not only ensuring multinational companies stable access to the largest consumer market in the world but also guaranteeing that their investment is safe, noted Luis Rubio, who heads the Center of Research for Development in Mexico City. The makings of a Mexican strategy for defending its interests started coming into focus on Monday, when President Enrique Peña Nieto declared that negotiations for a future relationship with the United States would not be limited to trade. “We will bring to the table all themes,” he said in a speech. “Trade, yes, but also migration and the themes of security, including border security, terrorist threats and the traffic of illegal drugs, weapons and cash. ” His hope is that by introducing broader uncertainty about the bilateral relationship  —   Will Mexico still cooperate in the fight against drug trafficking? Will it stop foreign terrorists from using Mexico as a way station into the United States?  —   Mexico can raise the stakes enough for Mr. Trump to reconsider his “America first” approach to commerce. “Mexico has a lot of chips to play,” said Jorge Castañeda, a former foreign secretary who has staked out a combative approach. Let Mr. Trump pull the United States out of Nafta, he argues. Instead of stopping Central American migrants at its southern border, Mexico should let them through on their way to the United States. “And let’s see if his wall keeps the terrorists out, because we won’t,” Mr. Castañeda added. The view from Mexico City is not uniformly bleak. Some analysts believe there is a potential for a situation in which a new Nafta benefits all. “I have always believed one should never let a good crisis go to waste,” said Arturo Sarukhán, a former Mexican ambassador to the United States. “There is an opportunity that we could end up modernizing and improving Nafta. ” The view that there is a potential silver lining to Mr. Trump’s hostility toward Nafta is also popular in some Washington circles. The    agreement is due for some modernization anyway, if only to deal with things like data protection, online crime and    —   which were not around in the early 1990s. Nafta’s weak provisions on labor and environmental standards could also be improved. Many aspects of Nafta could be upgraded, trade experts say. It could do with new rules to open up government projects to bidders from all three Nafta partners. Allowing   trucking companies from Mexico and the United States into each other’s markets could make trade between the two more efficient. What’s more, the   border could benefit from more infrastructure investments to integrate energy networks, reduce clogged lines at border crossings and the like. Now that Mr. Trump has formally nixed the   Partnership, which would have tied North America and nine other nations from the Pacific Rim into one large trade bloc, some of its provisions could be drafted into a new North American deal. Gary Hufbauer of the   Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington suggests that the name “Nafta” be retired  —   it has a bad reputation. But a lot of its substance could remain, perhaps in the form of separate bilateral agreements with Canada and Mexico. “Trump wants some easy victories,” Mr. Hufbauer pointed out. If he can score political points using his Twitter feed to persuade a few companies to keep jobs in the United States, why risk hurting the American economy by abandoning the North American trade deal? “Maybe that’s the reconciliation,” Mr. Hufbauer said. Still, it’s hard to reconcile the proposal for an improved, more effective trading pact in North America with Mr. Trump’s frequent portrayal of trade as a   game that inevitably shortchanges the United States. In Mr. Trump’s eyes, improving Nafta seems to mean eliminating Mexico’s trade surplus with the United States and limiting investment by American multinationals in Mexico. But one can’t quickly eliminate a $60 billion trade surplus with a new Nafta  —   not unless it has some incredibly draconian limits on imports or local content requirements that could be as damaging to Mexico as abandoning the pact altogether. Many Mexican officials fear that it is precisely this kind of draconian change that Mr. Trump has in mind. It would be politically profitable, at least in the short term. And it would signal toughness to China  —   a more formidable rival that is next on Mr. Trump’s list. If Canada stays out of the fray, cutting a separate deal with the United States to replace Nafta, Mexico would be left alone in an existential fight for its future. In this case, Mexico may have no choice but to raise the stakes and hope to arrive at the negotiating table with a threat at least as credible as Mr. Trump’s promise to pull out of the deal. Mr. Trump’s negotiating position does have some soft spots. For one, said Mickey Kantor, the American trade negotiator who concluded the Nafta negotiations during the Clinton administration, “he is under pressure to deliver a deal. ” If Mexico stands its ground and even allows Nafta to dissolve, it would send its own signal to China: Resistance is not futile. And Mr. Trump’s threat to raise tariffs against Mexico to 35 percent could easily be challenged under the rules of the World Trade Organization. This is, of course, a hugely risky strategy for Mexico. When Mr. Trump entered the presidential race in June 2015, a dollar was worth about 15 pesos. Now it’s worth about 22. A frontal confrontation with the United States might send it to 40, Mexican officials fear, fueling capital flight. And yet that may be Mexico’s strongest card. As noted by C. Fred Bergsten, director emeritus of the Peterson Institute, an irony of Mr. Trump’s approach to Mexico is that by weakening the peso so much, he is going to increase the bilateral trade deficit, increase Mexico’s competitiveness and make it more attractive for American companies to invest there. “That is going to swamp anything he achieves with his    efforts,” he added. That’s if Mexico manages to hold on. The more ominous situation is one in which the United States pushes too hard and Mexico  —   its economy, its unpopular government, its public order and political stability  —   buckles. The United States has enjoyed a peaceful southern border for 100 years, since Pancho Villa made his marauding raids into the Southwest during the Mexican Revolution. “That is worth pure gold in this and any other world,” Mr. Castañeda said. “Mexico’s best argument is ‘Don’t mess with that. ’”"
"Emma Laughton’s memories of the days before lockdown may not be like yours. When the shops and supermarkets around her home in east Yorkshire overflowed with people in search of essentials, she was trying to furnish a caravan. “Everyone was fighting over milk and bread and there I was, running around trying to get crockery and cutlery,” she says. Exactly a month before Boris Johnson ordered a nation to stay at home, two metres of dirty water had coursed into the modest red-brick semi that Laughton shared with her husband, Richard, and their three sons. The flood, which devastated East Cowick, a small village a mile south of the River Aire, left the family traumatised and homeless.  Britain had just waded through the wettest February ever recorded, as endless rain throughout winter, and a series of Atlantic storms, overwhelmed rivers across the country. In four months, almost 5,000 homes were flooded. Then one disaster rolled straight into another. Receding waters left victims in limbo, facing a global pandemic, lockdown and indefinite delays to insurance payouts and building work. The Laughtons tried to save what they could, moving some of their belongings upstairs before fleeing to higher ground. “Some people stayed and were trying to dig trenches, but it was like plaiting fog,” Laughton, 41, says, laughing at the memory. “There was no way it was going to work.” More than 100 houses were flooded in East Cowick and the nearby town of Snaith, where Emma manages a physiotherapy clinic. It was Richard’s dream to raise a family where he had grown up. The house is yards from his parents’ farm, for which he has always worked. Their crops include peas and potatoes, which were also ruined in the flood. The couple moved into the house when Jack, now 13, was a baby, and have since raised Harry, now 10, and Joseph, six. Before the waters peaked, Laughton was able to wade into her house to assess the damage so far. “The fireplace had already been knocked off the wall and the sofa was bouncing about upside down,” she says. “The most devastating part was looking down the garden at the kids’ slide and swing, which were only just visible above the water. All their toys, and the whole of their life here, just gone.” The Laughtons crammed into an uncle’s house for a month before the insurance company agreed to pay for the rent of the caravan, which is parked on the farm. A hastily plumbed washing machine sits under a shelter outside. The family moved in on 21 March, two days before Boris Johnson announced the national lockdown. They are still there; a family of five, squeezed into three boxy bedrooms. At a small kitchen table with only four chairs, Emma and Richard have tried to homeschool three children – and continue to rescue their flooded house. But the firm that was going to dry it out furloughed its staff; then the builder that the insurer had asked to estimate the cost of remedial work couldn’t come out. When I first spoke to Emma in June, her house needed new wiring, central heating and floors. A ladder stands in place of the stairs that had to be ripped out. She felt despairing and abandoned. The caravan has seemed smaller with each passing week, and the children have suffered from anxiety after losing first their home, then any sense of routine due to the pandemic. Laughton thinks the family will need therapy. “I lose the plot on a daily basis,” she says. *** Britain was soggy even before the start of last winter. Summer 2019 was among the wettest on record. Rivers raged. In November, the Don, which flows through Sheffield, Rotherham and Doncaster, reached record levels. Dozens of marooned shoppers spent a night in Sheffield’s Meadowhall mall as the streets around it flooded. In Derbyshire, Annie Hall, the county’s former high sheriff, died after being swept away near Matlock. Roads, railway lines and schools were closed as multiple rivers burst their banks. In December, southern England bore the brunt of yet more extreme weather. Police declared a major incident in west Cornwall. A tornado wrote off roofs and cars in Surrey. Then the Atlantic storms rolled in, propelled in rapid succession by an unusually strong and southerly jet stream. Ciara, Dennis and Jorge brought gales and yet more rain. By then, the water had nowhere to go. East Cowick was among the last places to be struck as waters rose across a giant belt of northern England, the Midlands and Wales. It might be hard to remember now, but the floods dominated bulletins and front pages for weeks. Dan Jarvis, the Labour MP for Barnsley Central, remembers them as a “seismic event” for Yorkshire. Jarvis, who is also mayor of the Sheffield city region, visited the village of Fishlake after it was evacuated in November. “It took me hours to get into the centre of the village,” he says. “It felt like a place under siege, with huge great pumps gushing water away. I’d never seen anything like it.” The Fishlake flood set a pattern for winter. Journalists crisscrossed Britain to meet devastated residents. Jarvis remembers villagers tiring of the media attention. “But I said to them, ‘We’ve got to make the most of it now, because it won’t be long before the waters recede and the camera crews head off. And then it will be harder to make the case for the action we need to prevent this happening again.’” He was soon proved right. In February, floods competed for attention with a wider looming crisis. By March, as the coronavirus gathered pace, the waters had receded. The camera crews had gone. “I think there is this sense now that people have been left behind and forgotten,” Jarvis says. *** Lisa Thwaites had always dreamed of running a cafe. Early last year, she took a redundancy payout from Thomson Reuters, the media corporation, where she was a manager at its offices on the edge of Mytholmroyd. The large village sits on the River Calder, 40 miles west of East Cowick. In August, Thwaites and a childhood friend took over the Blue Teapot, turning a traditional tearoom into a little vegetarian cafe between the Calder and the Rochdale canal. Thwaites, who is 44 and still brimming with optimism, says she could not get insurance for the cafe. Mytholmroyd has been flooded regularly, most recently in 2012 and 2015. But work was finally under way to protect 400 properties. The £35m scheme to move bridges, widen the river and raise its banks had been due to be finished by winter. In the meantime, Thwaites made regular payments into her own flood fund. “If it did happen again, I thought I’d have that pot to get back up and running,” she says. On Sunday 9 February, the Calder reached record high levels, easily breaching the unfinished new defences. More than a metre of water flowed into the Blue Teapot, burying Thwaites’ dreams in a thick carpet of mud. She worked for five weeks to get the place open again. Days later, lockdown forced her to close. A five-minute walk from the Blue Teapot, Suzanne Stankard, 58, lives alone in a two-up, two-down on the main road through Mytholmroyd. Stankard spent years abroad as a textiles lecturer before coming back to Yorkshire in 2014 to work at Leeds Arts University. In her younger days, she lived in a flat but now felt it was time to put down roots. She invested everything in her little house, which backs on to the river, moving in in April last year. She hung her textiles on the walls, bringing a flavour of Malaysia to the Calder Valley. “It’s got beams and an inglenook fireplace,” she says. “I thought I’d never be able to own another property and I just loved it. It was exactly what I wanted.” Like Thwaites, Stankard felt reassured by the new defences and the unlikeliness of another severe flood so soon after the last one. Even as Storm Ciara swept across England, she went to bed without a second thought. Early next morning, her phone lit up with messages from neighbours. “I looked out the window and could see how high the river was coming,” she says. A puddle crept under the back door. “I started mopping but then just stood there, watching it come into the living room, around my sofa. One inch, two inches.” She retreated to her stairs, climbing a step at a time as the waters rose. “It was a feeling of terror: I can still feel it now,” she says, four months later. “I was watching in disbelief, thinking, when is it ever going to stop?” When it did stop, more than a metre of water filled Stankard’s home. “By then I was lying on my bed, terrified, and crying at the shock of it,” she says. The water’s gentle rise and fall belied its destructive force: a dresser toppled; the inglenook stove was ruined; the kitchen destroyed. And there was mud, everywhere. It ruined old photo slides from her travels and a treasured photograph of her mother as a girl. When we speak, Stankard is still camping in her home, waiting for any work to be done. For weeks after the flood, she became deeply anxious and had to take weeks off work. “I couldn’t sleep, I couldn’t get to grips with what had happened in here,” she says, pausing. “It was just... that water, that amount of water.” More than 120 miles north, Gino Antonacci had put everything into the Bridge House guesthouse in Hawick, in the Scottish Borders. He had rescued the building from dereliction in the early 1990s, evicting a pair of hens to create a modest B&B and Sonia’s Bistro, named after his wife. Antonacci, 67, had considered selling the business and retiring a couple of years ago, but couldn’t bear to see it go. The guesthouse, which sits on the corner of the Teviot, an increasingly flood-prone tributary of the Tweed, and the smaller Slitrig Water, had survived serious flooding in 2005 and 2015. Storm Ciara spared Hawick from floodwater but the rivers were dangerously high. During breakfast in the bistro, a dog walker ran in to tell guests that a chunk of the guesthouse foundations was missing. Cracks began to open in the walls. Everyone got out. An hour later, the entire corner of the two-storey building crumbled into the river. Beds and television sets floated away. The dust settled to reveal what looked like a shattered doll’s house. “I can’t even remember what I was thinking,” Antonacci says of the collapse, a video of which made worldwide news. “I was completely cold, frozen.” Antonacci’s insurer took three months to accept his claim. By then, lockdown had further delayed rebuilding work. The stress got to him. He and Sonia went back to a family home near Rome to recover and isolate. In Hawick, his guest rooms remain exposed to the weather. He can’t see the place reopening until well into next year, but is determined that it will. “That building has become a part of me,” he says. *** John Curtin, a hydrologist and flood forecaster, joined the Environment Agency when it was formed in 1996. As its director of flood and coastal risk management, he is now responsible for keeping homes dry. The scale of that task this winter became clear in February, when the colour-coded map the government agency uses to show UK rainfall compared to the monthly average ran out of shades of blue. Light blue had denoted average rainfall, through to a very dark navy for triple the normal levels. Later that day, Curtin published a new map with two new shades of purple to show wide areas of the country where four or more times normal levels of rain had fallen. “It’s incredible to have had that on the back of the winter we’d already been through.” Curtin visited Mytholmroyd in early March. The opening of a new £7m bridge in May, designed to let more water flow under it, felt to residents like a fire engine attending a pile of ashes. While Curtin tells me it was “heartbreaking” that the flood scheme there was not finished in time for Storm Ciara, he also says it’s too early to know whether it would have prevented another flood as bad as February’s.  A “mosaic” of measures builds resilience, Curtin explains, including better farming practices and land management to reduce run-off. The agency’s forecasting and warning systems are also improving. “We know that the worst mental health stress affects people who are unwarned and unprepared,” he adds. He is anxious to point out that 10 times as many houses flooded in the 2007 storms, despite river levels then being generally lower than this year. But the agency has also been forced to shift its approach. “We tended to have a cycle of flood, invest, flood, invest – but then you were just responding to the last event,” Curtin says. “We want to understand what climate change will bring, especially with sea level rises, and prepare our communities.” Put another way, he says, “our thinking needs to change faster than the climate”. Flood protection in Britain has always been fraught – and deeply political. There were riots and court battles in the 17th century when a scheme to drain vast expanses of eastern England inadvertently caused Snaith and Fishlake to flood. Pumps, washlands and culverts still help to protect that precarious reclamation. They have largely worked; Snaith last flooded badly in 1947. But this year the area ended up under an expanse of water almost the size of Windermere. The Laughtons blame the authorities. They say culverts were blocked and pumps did not work; that their village was effectively sacrificed. “It wasn’t a natural flood, I believe. Others may differ,” Emma says. East Riding Council says an investigation it launched into the cause of the floods in East Cowick and Snaith is ongoing. The Environment Agency refutes any suggestion of deliberate flooding. “We do not sacrifice town X for town Y – it’s just not how we operate,” Curtin says. Anger towards the authorities had simmered all winter. Six days after the November floods, Boris Johnson engaged awkwardly with a mop in a Matlock branch of Specsavers. He was heckled in South Yorkshire. Labour accused the prime minister of neglect and of being distracted by the general election campaign. Johnson faced criticism again in February for staying at Chevening in Kent, one of the estates at his disposal, when Storm Ciara struck. He was heckled again during a late visit to Bewdley in Worcestershire. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, announced an extra £2.6bn for capital flood defence projects in the March budget, although this does not include new funds for maintaining defences, many of which were breached or damaged. Dan Jarvis said in July that £16m of government money for flood prevention in South Yorkshire was “completely inadequate”, and a fraction of the £270m he had requested. After his visit to Fishlake in November, Jarvis called for an emergency floods summit so that authorities and agencies could better coordinate. He says the government had agreed to a meeting before lockdown, but “nothing has happened [since]”. A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs tells me investment over the next six years will protect 336,000 properties, and that ministers are “still working to identify suitable arrangements” for the Yorkshire summit. Meanwhile, the weather records keep toppling. Adaptation and a degree of fatalism may be required. As the environment secretary, George Eustice, said in February: “We’ll never be able to protect every single household.” *** For some, the emotional attachment to a home is more powerful than any flood. Siobhan O’Connor lives in the house where she grew up in Shrewsbury, the Shropshire market town close to the Welsh border. The house, which her parents bought almost 50 years ago, sits at the end of a lane just yards from the River Severn, which meanders ominously around the town’s medieval centre. O’Connor’s parents are old enough to remember the 1947 floods, which devastated England. But Shrewsbury largely escaped further serious flooding until 1998. “I think we’ve been flooded 12 times since then, but not as badly as this year,” she says. O’Connor, who runs a small communications company, moved back into the house 12 years ago and lives with her father and young son. Her mother died last year. After severe floods in 2000, the family raised electrical sockets, added flood-proof plaster and acquired pumps. But the pumps were no match for what happened in February, when the Severn breached its banks. When I speak to O’Connor in June, brown water still fills her washing machine and – thanks to lockdown – a cleanup crew is only just arriving. Work to better protect Shrewsbury is being done, but O’Connor wouldn’t leave either way. “My mum’s from Lancashire and she loved the north, but she absolutely loved this house,” she says. “She’d watch her sons row past on the river and my son is about to start. It’s beautiful here and full of memories. So what do you do?” Like everyone I speak to, O’Connor found strength in her community. In Mytholmroyd, people donated time and materials to help the Blue Teapot reopen. Suzanne Stankard describes the response of neighbours in her street as “like going back 100 years”. Hawick townsfolk rallied around Gino Antonacci, raising thousands on a crowdfunding page. In Snaith and East Cowick, the 12th-century St Laurence priory, which sits on high ground, became a refuge and community centre. “At one point I had firefighters napping in one of the chapels,” says the rector Eleanor Robertshaw. Robertshaw led a team of volunteers who supplied food, bedding and clothing to residents who had been flooded, as well as a steady flow of tea. The church was also a place of calm in which to take a breath, or share information. Emma Laughton retreated there every morning just to sit briefly with neighbours. “We could talk about insurance and know what was happening,” she says. Lockdown then forced the church to shut, and the village lost its community centre. “We felt awful about it,” Robertshaw says. Technology filled part of the gap. Robertshaw began uploading recorded sermons to YouTube (“I don’t trust myself not to swear doing them live,” she says) and had a bigger congregation than ever. Laughton is part of a busy village messaging group they call the Cowick Riviera. Laughton has also endured the loss of the family’s submerged potato crop, the death of a 70-year-old aunt, who caught the coronavirus in hospital, and emergency surgery on Jack’s hand after a go-karting accident. She is still waiting for the impact of it all to hit her, she says: “I’m very much the sort of person that gets on with it and then it affects them after. I’m not there yet.” When I call again in early August, the insurance money has at last come through and building work is under way. Laughton hopes the family can move back into their house in early September. Daily visits to the building site have helped Joseph, their six-year-old son, who had developed behavioural problems during the long wait for life to feel normal again. Laughton says only a handful of residents on her street have been able to go home, almost six months after Storm Ciara. While she can’t wait to leave the caravan, she says the flood has shattered her bond with the home in which she was raising a family. “I keep going back to this shell of a house, but I’ve got no love for it any more,” she said in June. “We were hoping to extend but now we’re just waiting for house prices to come up so we can move.” She is prepared to make a loss – flooded houses tend not to sell well – but some things are more important. “I just wouldn’t feel safe keeping my family here.” Days after we speak in August, rainstorms once again sweep across parts of Britain after an unprecedented heatwave, blocking roads and flooding homes. As summer turns to autumn, the Laughtons and the 5,000 victims of last winter’s inundations will hope that more than a year passes before the next “once-in-a-generation” flood turns their lives upside down."

[Fair and Reasonable Campaign ](https://www.fairandreasonable.co.nz/)



Last night I met with the lawyers again to discuss what Parliament is doing on the Arms Legislation Bill and our court case against Stuart Nash and the Government.



 **This Court case is our one chance to have Stuart Nash and Jacinda Ardern’s unfair decisions reviewed by the Courts before the election.**



 **Now that the Parliamentary vote is so tight, the case is even more important to demonstrate to New Zealanders why what the Government is doing is wrong.**



I know a lot of people have held off contributing to the cause until we could demonstrate that we had a good case, and a court date. **That time is right now, so I am writing to ask you to contribute to our legal fighting fund.**



 **The judicial review is designed to enlist NZ First, National, and ACT, in reinstating what was once unchallenged principle: that taking away property rights and creating serious punishment overnight, is wrong. NZ First is the key.**



Because the Select Committee heard and found nothing to justify most of this second instalment, there is no reason why NZ First can’t tell their Cabinet colleagues they just won’t allow last year’s tragedy in Christchurch to be exploited. NZ First knows that the Bill attacks lawful firearms users, not criminals. They know the Bill has scarcely a single provision relevant to stopping terrorists or other criminal shooters (whether mad or bad). 



**But turning around a political juggernaut is hard. Politicians in a democracy respond to majority opinion. And as you’ve seen over the last eight months, we have been working furiously to ensure the public can look behind the slogans they heard at a vulnerable time last year.**



So to win, we have to ensure there is enough media and public understanding of the facts so that (1) NZ First blocks the own goal aspects of the Bill, and (2) National also feel confident of enough public understanding to agree with (and support) any NZ First-led initiative.



Our Court case is an essential part of the campaign to show how wrong the Police advice has been, and how unprincipled. Media and other opinion leaders can start with prejudice, but they trust courts to be objective.



 **In Court for two days starting May 4**



We have just been given the Court timetable: two days starting on 4 May at the High Court in Wellington (the Monday and Tuesday immediately following duck shooting opening weekend).



 **We have a strong case. We’ve chosen to take on the government on the set of facts where Stuart Nash and Jacinda Ardern are at their weakest. Our QC is getting ready to represent us. But we still need your help to get us to the fundraising target so we can put up the best possible case.**



We’ve asked the Court to look at the Government’s process in the banning of ammo. Because their ammo definitions have absolutely nothing to do with safety. Stuart Nash just applied Police prejudices, unsupported by research or disciplined risk assessments. 



Worse, they denied compensation completely, as if people with banned ammo became wrong-doers overnight.



So we are focused on this aspect, as our lawyers are confident that this route is the best demonstration of the Government’s lack of reason in poor processes by the Minister and the Police. But many of the principles and objections apply to the Government’s approach in other areas.



 **Before the hearing, our team needs to finish gathering our evidence – including from international experts. We want to lodge affidavits from them, reply to the Government’s evidence, make written legal submissions and cross submissions. All of those steps churn time and resources. We cannot let the Government burn us off, that is why I am asking for your support right now.**



We are asking the court to recognise that a Minister without good reason to know it would make people safer, should get told to start again, and next time to offer fair compensation, or explain why not.



While the lawyers are heavily discounting their usual fees, that fact is the Government is ensuring that this process isn’t cheap.



 **Will you make a contribution to the firearm owners’ fighting fund, so we can take on Stuart Nash’s taxpayer-funded legal team?**



 **To put our best foot forward, we need to raise at least $41,500 to ensure we get a valuable precedent that everyone remembers, next time they want to scapegoat ordinary people instead of targeting criminals.**



The Government’s approach was designed to create a ‘them and us’ climate in New Zealand – to exploit an opportunity to create fear of firearms and of firearm owners. Winning this case makes it easier for sensible, decent people, who know little of firearms, to approve of their MPs cutting back on the toxic stuff in the Bill. It makes it more respectable to sympathise with our cause. Winning the case should get, at a minimum, a Judge to tell the Government to go back to the drawing board, at least on the ammo decisions. 



And that is all part of the bigger, unending, campaign to ensure that for the foreseeable future, politicians are not tempted to think it will be easy to win votes by vilifying lawful firearms users.



Winning this case is a vital part of the strategy to cement in place a widespread Wellington understanding that lying about firearms users will cost more, politically, than it is worth. Because we will not lie down and take it. We will make the truth known. Please support this Court case, to make that happen.



 ** _ps. the legal case is just one of the strategies we are implementing to defeat the Government and the proposed new bans._**[ ** __**](http://www.fairandreasonable.co.nz/donate?e=fc4d8ed9a839d493bcf80e4732907a3d&utm_source=fairandreasonable&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=200219_court_hearing_v2&n=9)

"Gordon Brown and Kevin Rudd want to stimulate the climate conscience of the under-developed world with bribes of $122 billion PER YEAR stolen from western taxpayers and consumers (The Australian 8 July).
Naturally the UN approves. Having failed so spectacularly to combat terrorism, genocide and dictatorship they now see a job they can do – handling the climate change slush fund.
At best, this money will subsidise our competitors in India, China, Russia, Brazil and South Africa to modernise their factories and power stations. More likely, it will evaporate in a carbon credit scam, feed the climate change industry, or disappear into some Swiss bank account.
Our overheated, carbon burning, world travelling PMs needs to do what global warming is doing: pause and cool down.

There are, of course, lots of differences between conservatives and progressives (I hesitate to say “liberals”, because most are, in fact, thoroughgoing authoritarians), otherwise, they wouldn’t be in opposition to one another. But one of the big differences, some argue, is that progressives are [more focussed on emotions than practicalities](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/11/141107091559.htm). Hence, conservatives characterise progressives as emotional children. In their turn, progressives see conservatives as cold-hearted plodders.



Nowhere is this more evident, perhaps, than in the “climate wars”. Progressives literally weep and scream at the sky and glue themselves to roads, demanding **action NOW**. Conservatives cock a sceptical eyebrow and ask what all this hysteria is **going to cost**.



In Australia, the Coalition government largely follows former prime minister **Tony Abbott** ’s philosophy of “direct action”. Rather than signing up to emotionally satisfying pledges and “commitments”, the government claims to be vesting its energy into what works. That its approach seems to be paying off (“denialist” Australia’s emission have reduced, while “progressive” New Zealand’s have increased) does nothing to satisfy the progressive champions of dramatic climate “action” – mostly, it seems, because the Morrison government refuses to parrot the emotional “climate emergency” script.



 **Scott Morrison** is expected to adopt a technology target to avoid Australia signing up to an internationally imposed requirement for net zero emissions by 2050, with the new ­climate change plan to be presented at this year’s UN summit in Glasgow[…arguing] that its technology target is the best way to meet the net zero goal that countries signed up to in the 2015 Paris Agreement.



While **Jacinda Ardern** captured headlines at last years Pacific Island Forum, castigating the Morrison government for not saying the right things on climate, Morrison was quietly fostering technologies to tackle very real problems like ocean plastic pollution. Morrison is continuing the same plodding, practical approach.



As the climate change debate intensified within the Coalition, the Prime Minister on Monday remained steadfast over the government’s refusal to sign up to an international target without being able to tell Australians the cost.



“I don’t sign up to anything when I can’t look Australians in the eye and tell them what it costs,” Mr Morrison said. “None of that information is before me that would enable me to give any such commitment.”



Mr Morrison on Tuesday would not confirm he would set a technology target, but said he would be pushing technology over taxes to tackle climate change.



“You want to get global emissions down? That’s what you need. You need technology that can be accessed and put in place, not just here in Australia, but all around the world,” he said in Melbourne.



“Meetings won’t achieve that, technology does. And I can tell you taxes won’t achieve it either.”



It doesn’t help that vested interests seem to have spied a government-funded golden goose and are lining up with their hands out.



The Business Council of Australia, which has backed a target of net zero emissions by 2050, ­released a scoping study for members this month that suggested, based on calculations produced by Europe on the scale of investment required, that Australia would need to spend “at least” $22bn a year on new investment in technology to reach the target.



Investing in new technology is a great idea – so long as it’s their own money. Too often, business in Australia has been too short-sighted to invest in new technology, either leaving it to the public sector or worse, letting it be sold overseas.



Speaking of greenwashing cronies, there’s no show without bitter, unloved Punch.



Former prime minister **Malcolm Turnbull** accused the government of being “dangerous and idiotic” for not taking stronger ­action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.



Of course, the fact that Turnbull has massive investments in greenwashing schemes, not to mention an axe to grind against the party which so unceremoniously dumped him, has nothing to do with it.



If the Morrison government has any sense, it will ignore the bleating, screeching and bodice-ripping of the climate alarmists and keep plodding on with what is so far delivering results, not words.

"Wandering albatrosses have long been considered exceptional creatures. They can fly 8.5 million kilometres during their lifetimes – the equivalent of flying to the Moon and back more than ten times. Their three-and-a-half-metre wing span is the same length as a small car and they can weigh as much as 24 puffins. Their body shape means they can effortlessly glide over the ocean waves, flying in some of the strongest winds on Earth. Now research led by the Centre d'études biologiques de Chizé in France has found that these seabirds may have promising careers in the fight against overfishing.  Accidental bycatch in fishing lines and nets – when fishers unintentionally snare animals they weren’t trying to catch, like albatrosses – kills hundreds of thousands of birds and mammals each year. In the past few decades, countries have worked together to implement cross-border policies to directly address the causes of bycatch, particularly for albatrosses and petrels which have been severely affected. With onboard human observers or electronic devices tracking activity, albatross bycatch rates have fallen dramatically on monitored vessels. But what about illegal fishing boats? Military vessels and aeroplanes patrol the Southern Ocean looking for criminal fishers, but there are no observers or monitoring to ensure these boats are using methods to protect albatrosses, and without these, we know that bycatch rates are very high. 


      Read more:
      Small-scale fisheries have unintended consequences on tropical marine ecosystems


 Boats that are legally fishing are generally registered and licensed, and so must adhere to laws regarding where and when they fish, and what and how much they can catch. Monitoring fishery activity around land masses is one thing, but beyond these limits, the open ocean is deemed international waters and doesn’t come under the jurisdiction of a single nation. Patrolling this enormous area by ship or air is rarely effective. But what if there were 100 officers that could cover 10,000 kilometres each in a 30-day stretch? Meet the albatross ocean sentinels who patrol the seas for illegal fishers. Wandering albatrosses breed on remote islands around Antarctica. These are usually only accessible by boat, and researchers must brave the “furious 50s” of the Southern Ocean to get there, across some of the roughest seas in the world.   So many birds were dying as a result of getting caught in fishing lines that researchers started studying the overlap between albatrosses and fishing boats. Understanding where the birds came into contact with fisheries, and which birds followed boats the most, helped explain which parts of the population were most at risk of bycatch.  Researchers mapped the distribution of boats using data transmitted from onboard monitoring systems, but these records are often only available around land and rarely in real time. Given the amount of time the birds spend in the open ocean, this meant that researchers had little idea of how many birds overlapped with fishing boats and for how long. To address this problem, researchers developed loggers that could be attached to an albatross. The logger detects the radar of boats, collecting information on where boats are in real time. The loggers took years to perfect and I can still remember the excitement of getting the first one back that had successfully detected a boat’s radar.  The data showed how the sex, age or personality of each bird affected how likely the bird was to come into contact with fishing boats. For example, males tend to forage to the south, closer to Antarctica where fishing boats are rarer, while females forage further north, bringing them closer to the tropics and into contact with hotspots of fishing activity. Understanding this variation was the primary aim of the research, to help ecologists understand how deaths in subsections of the population can have dramatic effects on the population as a whole. But the loggers also provided bonus data that could transform fishery management and conservation in the open oceans. Originally this work began to differentiate between fishing boats and other vessels, to test whether birds were more likely to be attracted to fishing boats. But when we combined the data collected by the loggers with a global map, we could see the location of all boats with an active Automatic Identification System (AIS). This radar allows vessels to detect each other, preventing collisions. But our study found that over 20% of boats within French waters didn’t have their AIS on, rising to 35% in international waters. Since the AIS is intended to keep vessels safe, it’s likely that these vessels operating without it in international waters were doing so to avoid detection, and so could be fishing illegally. The albatross data had unintentionally revealed the potential extent and scale of illegal fishing in the Southern Ocean. It’s difficult to imagine a human patrol boat being able to cover enough area to efficiently track illegal fisheries. But each wandering albatross could potentially cover the same area of ocean as a boat, and when its logger detects a fishing boat with its AIS turned off, it can relay that information to the authorities, who can alert nearby vessels to investigate.  Data collection on this scale would not only improve our ability to detect and manage illegal fisheries, but also to identify high risk areas for conservation. This would help conserve fish stocks, protect albatrosses and other seabirds, and manage the marine ecosystem as a whole. As ocean sentinels, albatrosses have a unique ability to collect the data needed for their own conservation. Their pioneering role in animal-led data collection paves the way for other species to track the human activities that risk their persistence in the wild."

Just when you thought the world could not get any more bizarre, a purveyor of the filthy fossil fuels that are essentially carbon, declares that it is going to be ‘net zero by 2050’.



Presumably they mean net zero business, net zero profit and net zero point in existing?



It seems that the coffee in the executive canteen has been spiked with the climate kool-aid given the nonsense emanating from the higher echelons of BP.



The energy giant has pledged to invest more in low carbon technologies and less in oil and gas after acknowledging “the world’s carbon budget is finite and running out fast”.



CEO **Bernard Looney** said: “We need a rapid transition to net zero. We all want energy that is reliable and affordable, but that is no longer enough.



“It must also be cleaner. To deliver that, trillions of dollars will need to be invested in replumbing and rewiring the world’s energy system. It will require nothing short of reimagining energy as we know it.”



The company says it will deliver net zero across its operations and its oil and gas production on an absolute basis by 2050 or sooner, while also halving the carbon intensity of products it sells by this time. […]



How exactly, does one halve the carbon intensity of oil products? Petrol is approx 85% carbon, 14% hydrogen, a bit of nitrogen and a few other trace elements. BP’s new and improved ‘woke’ petrol will thus be 42% carbon, 14% hydrogen, 2% nitrogen and 42% what? Water? Unicorn farts? Pixie dust? Labour party promises?



Under the plan, BP will increase the proportion of money it invests into non-oil and gas businesses – it will also advocate for policies that support net zero, including carbon pricing, incentivising its workforce to advocate for net zero, leading transparent reporting and launching a new team to help countries, cities and large companies decarbonise.



It notes the commitment means it will need to “fundamentally reorganise to become a more focused, more integrated company”.



Mr Looney added: “This will certainly be a challenge but also a tremendous opportunity. It is clear to me, and to our stakeholders, that for BP to play our part and serve our purpose, we have to change. And we want to change – this is the right thing for the world and for BP.”



Thanks for the heads-up for any who might still be holding BP shares, Bernard. Fortunately, I sold mine a little while ago.



Get woke, go broke.

"The Carbon Sense Coalition has delivered its submission to the  Australian Senate Standing Committee on Climate Change in response to the Exposure Draft of the “Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill 2009″.
The recommendations are:

The Senate must reject the “Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill” on the basis of its “Two Fatal Flaws” – the science and the economics. It is not supported by independent scientific assessment, nor does it present any credible cost benefit analysis. Moreover, at a time when politicians are calling for better financial disclosure and discipline, this Bill is alarming in its deceptive advertising, shows contempt for good practice by omitting independent expert reports, and stands condemned for failure to disclose the numerous vested interests supporting its claims.
The Bill should also be rejected for promoting the risky and repugnant idea that Australia can or should lead the world into universal acceptance of a massive program of wealth distribution administered by bodies such as the United Nations. This shows a lack of appreciation of the fact that popular opinion all over the world is turning strongly against the global warming hysteria, and many significant industrial nations such as China, India, Brazil and Russia are motivated solely by what they see will promote their own national interest and industrial strength.
Finally the Bill should be rejected because of the naivety of people who tell us that a nation which generates 90% of its electricity from coal, and which also prohibits nuclear power, can maintain energy supplies for its people while cutting per capita production of carbon dioxide by 30% over the next decade or so. This cannot be done without either significant cuts in living standards or reduced population.
However, the Carbon Sense Coalition supports every initiative to reduce pollution of land, air or water. We also support energy conservation, and oppose any subsidies that encourage waste and overuse of any energy type.
However neither of these worthy goals have anything to do with the effect of carbon dioxide on global warming. Unproven climate scares should not be used to promote secret agendas to introduce massive new consumption taxes on top of the rash of taxes already there such as Goods and Services Tax, Income Tax, Payroll Tax, Coal and Oil Royalties, petrol excise, vehicle and stock levies and so on

Cormann admits to relying on discredited reports



Senator Malcolm Roberts received confirmation today that the Government relies on discredited reports from the United Nations as a basis for its climate policies.



Independent scientists and its own authors have condemned this UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report.



Senator Roberts said “Neither the government nor CSIRO has performed due diligence on the UN climate reports, to ensure these are accurate and reflect the full body of scientific literature.”



“And yet the government uses these one-sided UN political reports as the basis for spending billions of dollars on renewables projects and nationwide green taxes,” he added.



Senator Roberts has spent a decade researching the core UN IPCC science chapters which purport to show the cause and effect relationship between human carbon dioxide and temperature.



“These core science chapters replace empirical scientific evidence with subjective garbage-in garbage-out climate models” said Senator Roberts.



The IPCC report relies heavily on erroneous climate models that have not been validated and falsely assume that human carbon dioxide is the main driver. 



“This is a failure of science and it is alarming that politicians rely on these flawed models to build a billion dollar climate economy; this is a travesty,” stated Senator Roberts.



“This goes to the core of our country’s governance that is based on corrupt socialist UN policies which are de-industrialising our country and gutting our nation,’ said Senator Roberts.



“If the UN IPCC were a corporation, an accountant or financial institution, it would belted for fraudulent, misleading and deceptive conduct,” he added.



One Nation calls on the government to immediately set up an independent review of climate science which will rely solely on empirically-based scientific evidence.

Over at Capital Weather Gang, the always-perceptive Jason Samenow details a recent Twitterspat between Dot Earth’s (aka _The New York Times_ ’) Andrew Revkin and Penn State’s Michael Mann over attributing extreme weather events to anthropogenic climate change—tornadoes, in particular.   
  
Revkin tweeted to ask whether the folks who were alluding to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions being behind the major (and deadly) tornado outbreak during the spring of 2011 were willing to attribute the record lack of tornado occurrences during the past 12 months to the same cause.   
  
Revkin could have very well asked this same question about all kinds of bad weather—blizzards, hurricanes, droughts, floods, record heat, record cold, summer in Washington, winter in Chicago, etc.   
  
Used to be, when the weather was bad, folks would logically cite Mark Twain’s “if you don’t like the weather in New England now, just wait a few minutes.” Now, someone will show up on TV who is quick to point out that this sort of thing “is consistent with” expectations of global warming. These same folks tend nap when the weather is hunky-dory, and to go into hibernation when the extreme weather category of their previous pronouncement has a hiatus.   
  
Since the bang-up year of 2011, the number of tornadoes has dropped off the table, with the last 12 months showing the fewest since systematic observations began in the 1950s.   
  
And like tornados, major hurricane strikes have also become scarce, in fact, they are so in remission that someone might soon announce they have been cured. It has currently been more than 7 years since a Category 3 made landfall in the U.S., the longest time in more than 100 years—and all this when overall hurricane activity in the Atlantic basin has been elevated. Maybe there is something to research that finds that while anthropogenic climate change may increase the frequency of major hurricanes in the Atlantic, it changes the circulation patterns such that they are more likely to remain offshore (see page 30-32 of our comments on the draft National Assessment Report)   
  
But we digress…   
  
Apparently the folks who rally around the anthropogenic climate change/extreme weather linkage don’t like being awoken when all is calm.   




In his response tweet, Michael Mann accused Revkin of “concern trolling”—which Samenow kindly defined for us as, in this case, “manufacturing a question to score points with climate change skeptics.”   
  
Mann followed up with “Perhaps Andy ‪@Revkin is claiming that the background state of the atmosphere has NOT changed? Is that what he is arguing?”   
  
We are sure that is _not_ what Revkin is arguing at all.   
  
It is true, and Revkin knows this, that human-activity in all its forms exerts some influence on the base state of the atmosphere. _So, what?_   
  
This does _not_ mean that such an influence is noticeable or even detectable, much less that every time the weather is bad, human activities are to blame.   
  
In fact, in virtually all cases, the magnitude of natural variability is still much larger than the magnitude of the human influence. Nor is the specific impact of the human influence on any weather event ever clear. For example, see our comments about “superstorm” Sandy.   
  
What this does smack of, is pseudoscience—an explanation of things that is not refutable by any conceivable event. Karl Popper famously drew this distinction in his 1957 essay (republished in 1963) _Science: Conjectures and Refutations_.   
  
If the explanation is that bad weather events serve as evidence that humans have altered the atmospheric base state in such a way as to perceptively influence (make worse) extreme weather events, but that the absence of such events does not serve as counter evidence, then we have a situation where the theory is untestable. Pseudoscience.   
  
Before we should even start to consider taking seriously claims about global warming making things worse, we need to start seeing some _predictions about individual events._   
  
Next time there is a discussion about a potential tornado outbreak somewhere in the U.S., we want to see _a priori_ discussions of how anthropogenic climate change will influence the event. For instance, will it lead to 25 tornadoes instead of 23? Will the storms stay on the ground for 15 minutes instead of 14? Will their path length be 12 miles instead of 11? Will they hit the Lazy Acres Trailer park or just skirt by? Will they occur when kids are gathered in the school cafeteria or just after lunch lets out? All these factors, and many orders of magnitude more, collectively determine the impact of the event. And this completely leaves out the confounding influence that there are now more people, with more stuff in potential harm’s way.   
  
Now, you might rightly point out that such predictions are impossible—the atmosphere is too chaotic and our models too coarse to pin down events with such detail.   
  
But until such forecasts are issued—it is also impossible to assess whether the event acted in a manner expected by the global warming alarmists.   
  
Despite this lack of predictive ability, there is no shortage of _ex post facto_ postmortems. Until that changes, no autopsies please!   
  
True science offers up expectations in advance (i.e. “hypotheses,” which, in the weather/climate business are called “forecasts”), and then uses observations to verify (or reject) those hypotheses. Pseudoscience accepts all observations as support of its theories.   
  
Isn’t it time we take a greater interest in the _science_ of climate change?

"**China is proposing to introduce a new security law in Hong Kong that could ban sedition, secession and subversion.**
The move is likely to provoke strong opposition internationally and in Hong Kong, which was last year rocked by months of pro-democracy protests.
China's delayed National People's Congress, its legislature, will debate the issue when it opens on Friday.
Chinese media said the move defended national security, but opponents said it could be the ""end of Hong Kong"".
Demonstrators in Hong Kong have repeatedly protested against what they see as a gradual erosion of the territory's autonomy by the communist lead government in Beijing.
The BBC's Robin Brant, in Shanghai, says that what makes the latest proposal so incendiary is that the Beijing government could bypass Hong Kong's elected officials and simply impose the changes.
The last British governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten, called the move a ""comprehensive assault on the city's autonomy"".
President Donald Trump said the US would react strongly if China followed through with its proposals.
The Hong Kong dollar dropped sharply on Thursday in anticipation of the announcement.
The issue has been introduced on the NPC agenda, under the title of Establishing and Improving the Legal System and Enforcement Mechanism of Hong Kong.
Hong Kong's mini-constitution, the Basic Law, which provides the territory certain freedoms not available on the mainland, does require its government to bring in a security law. It had tried to enact the so-called ""sedition law"" in 2003 but more than 500,000 people took to the streets and it was dropped.
A spokesman for the NPC said on Thursday that China was planning to improve on the ""one country, two systems"" policy that Hong Kong has observed.
Zhang Yesui said: ""National security is the bedrock underpinning the stability of the country. Safeguarding national security serves the fundamental interest of all Chinese, our Hong Kong compatriots included.""
Hong Kong is heading for elections to its own legislature in September and if last year's success for pro-democracy parties in district elections is repeated, government bills could be blocked.
A mainland source told the South China Morning Post that Beijing had decided Hong Kong would not be able to pass its own security law and the NPC would have to act.
China has the option to impose it into Annex III of the Basic Law, which covers national laws that must be observed in Hong Kong.
The opening of the NPC had been delayed because of the coronavirus outbreak.
The NPC spokesman would only say that more details would come on Friday.
Sources say the law will target terrorist activity in Hong Kong and prohibit acts of sedition, subversion and secession, as well as foreign interference in Hong Kong's affairs.
Pro-democracy activists fear it will be used to muzzle protests in defiance of the freedoms enshrined in the Basic Law.
Similar laws in China are used to silence opposition to the Communist Party.
There have already been calls inside Hong Kong for demonstrations.
Democratic lawmaker Dennis Kwok told Reuters: ""If this move takes place, 'one country, two systems' will be officially erased. This is the end of Hong Kong.""
He was echoed by Civic Party legislator, Tanya Chan, who said: ""One country, one system has truly come to Hong Kong."" She said this was the ""saddest day in Hong Kong history"".
Student activist and politician Joshua Wong tweeted that the move was an attempt by Beijing to ""silence Hong Kongers' critical voices with force and fear"".
The pro-Beijing DAB party said it ""fully supported"" the proposals, which were made ""in response to Hong Kong's rapidly worsening political situation in recent years"".
Pro-Beijing lawmaker Christopher Cheung added: ""Legislation is necessary and the sooner the better.""
An editorial in the state-run China Daily said the law meant that ""those who challenge national security will necessarily be held accountable for their behaviour"".
Political unrest had cooled during the coronavirus outbreak but its resurgence was apparent on Monday, when a number of pro-democracy lawmakers were dragged out of the legislative chamber during a row about a Chinese national anthem bill that would criminalise disrespect of it.
A group of 15 prominent pro-democracy activists also appeared in court on Monday charged with organising and taking part in unlawful assemblies related to last year's protests. Five also face the more serious charge of incitement.
Millions took to the streets for seven months last year in rallies that began peacefully but later spiralled into violent clashes.
Those protests were initially about another controversial bill allowing extraditions to the mainland. It was later dropped.
China's move also comes as the US is considering whether to extend Hong Kong's preferential trading and investment privileges. It must decide by the end of the month. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday expressed concern over Hong Kong's autonomy.
Hong Kong was ruled by Britain as a colony for more than 150 years up to 1997.
The Basic Law, which runs out in 2047, gives Hong Kong ""a high degree of autonomy, except in foreign and defence affairs"".
As a result, Hong Kong's own legal system, borders, and rights - including freedom of assembly and free speech - are protected.
For example, it is one of the few places in Chinese territory where people can commemorate the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown.
But Beijing has the ability to veto any changes to the political system and has, for example, ruled out direct election of the chief executive."

http://www.helium.com/items/1270584-is-solar-energy-solution-to-us-oil-dependence
No, solar energy is not the solution to reducing US oil dependency.
Considerable progress has been made in the development and use of solar energy world wide over the last decade. This is a good thing and no doubt will continue. But where does solar energy fit into the overall energy crisis problem?

The production of oil in the US has been declining since about 1975 due to apparent depletion of oil fields and to unfavorable Federal Government intervention and regulation, such as banning offshore drilling and closing down of oil wells. After all, why produce oil yourself when it can be imported more cheaply?
The recent sudden oil price hike to the unheard of $148 a barrel was a wake up call to the US, illustrating its precarious economic and strategic position in the world. The source of much imported oil is from Venezuela and some Middle East Arab countries which are not exactly friendly to the US. They seem to take a delight in taking a swipe at the world’s super power!
Today (December 2008), on settling in of the global financial crisis, the price of oil has plummeted to ca $45 a barrel! Why has this happened? Demand for and the use of oil couldn’t possibly have dropped over 50% within a month. Maybe credit to buy it has dried up?
The oil exporting countries are none too happy about the situation. For many this is their sole source of foreign currency and their economies are geared to having an oil price much higher, like $70 a barrel or more (Government expenditure always rises to meet income). OPEC has now decided to reduce supply by ca. 5%, in hope of improving the price and income for them. What a shambles the world economy is in!
Americans are rightly concerned about their over dependence on oil imports. What to do about it has produced a wide range of ideas and created businesses which need careful analysis as to their sensibility and viability. The time factor is important as these projects may be short, medium or long term solutions, or non-solutions to the problem (i.e., years to decades for results).
The popular response to the energy crisis today is to move away from the use of fossil fuels and towards “renewable energy”, such as solar and wind power and biofuels. This idea is promoted by Obama and the Democrats, and of course the Green Movement.
This is emphasized by Obama’s recent appointment for Secretary of Energy, namely Professor Steven Chu, of the University of California, Berkeley, an expert on renewable energy and Nobel Prize co-winner (Physics 1997). Chu is also the Director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory which is a center for research into biofuels and solar energy technologies, which employs 4000 people and has a budget of $650 million (Wikipedia).
If the future development of solar energy is going to make an impact on the energy crisis then it would seem that the choice of Steven Chu as Secretary of Energy is an excellent one. Well done Obama!
However, on reading the fine print of Chu’s biography I have my doubts that anything positive will come of it all. A major research objective of the National Laboratory is to develop technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. He is an advocate of alternative energy and believes that it is essential to move away from fossil fuels to combat global warming. In other words, he is a believer of Al Gore’s propaganda and the Green’s “Theory of Cataclysmic Global Warming”. He has to accept this to maintain his research grants. Chu, in my opinion, is “out on a limb and can’t get back”, and also, he is “barking up the wrong tree”.
This does not harbor confidence in many people for the future economy and prosperity of the USA!
So what is the solution to the energy crisis?
Firstly it is necessary to realize that all this demonization of carbon and atmospheric CO2 is unwarranted. It arises from it being an essential part of the Green religious propaganda but has no support from scientific observation. It is simply religious dogma. Like in the Middle Ages it was generally believed that the sun and moon revolved around the earth. The skeptics were imprisoned or burnt at the stake!
In fact, atmospheric CO2 produced by power stations, other industrial plants and automobiles acts as a free fertilizer for the biosphere. We need, of course to remove pollution from sulfur, particulates, and other minor toxic components of combustion, but CO2, like water vapor, is harmless and essential to life on earth. Atmospheric CO2 is NOT a pollutant. The gradual increase observed in atmospheric CO2 over the last 100 years, to 380 ppm, has been very beneficial to mankind by increasing crop yields and rates of growth. At atmospheres below 200 ppm CO2, plants wither, but at 1000 ppm they are quite happy and grow prolifically, such as when used in commercial controlled hothouse environments.
Also, the idea that increasing atmospheric CO2 causes global warming is bunkum, (nor can it make the oceans acidic), as shown by the huge amount of scientific evidence that has accumulated over the last decade. The United Nation’s IPCC which promotes this fraudulent scare mongering should be ignored (preferably sued) otherwise the world will descend further into economic chaos. This has already started due to the dodgy financial systems promoted by US bankers and financial “experts” of Wall Street. As President Putin of Russia is reported as saying ” You Americans started it all and caused this chaos”. However, maybe we can also lay blame on the Europeans (EU) for promoting all the bunkum about global warming and promoting a useless and harmful “Emission Trading Scheme” to remedy this non-problem.
Let’s forget about who is to blame and consider what to do about it all.
Once you accept the true state of affairs, that is that CO2 gas is an essential component of the atmosphere for life to exist and that more of it is a good thing then the best path ahead is obvious.
The world economy is totally dependent on oil for transport fuels and petrochemicals which maintain our present high standard of living. I predict that this will be so FOR EVER because the properties of element carbon and its derivatives are so unique that there are no adequate substitutes. Viva Carbon!
Also, I predict that in the year 2100, your descendants will be happily driving a GM? product (or Toyota) automobile fueled by gasoline, diesel or LPG.
Obviously, Professor Chu, the Director of the National Laboratory in Berkeley has got it wrong.
It would be more sensible if the objectives of this high powered laboratory were rotated 180 degrees and they concentrated on how to get “more bangs for the buck” out of fossil fuels.
Forget about Al Gore and his religious mania and get back to science!
For starters, immediately the US should get rid of Government restrictions on drilling for oil both on and off shore, so as to boost domestic production. Ditto impediments on construction of thermal and nuclear power stations. Requirements for utility companies to produce 10 or 20% of power from renewable resources should be abolished, this just being part of the Green’s eco-religious nonsense.
Research and development should concentrate on finding better, and more efficient ways of getting hydrocarbon fuels from coal and oil, and of generating electricity, without undue pollution, bearing in mind that atmospheric CO2 is NOT a pollutant.
Let us squeeze the last drop of oil out of the fields we know about. Let’s find new oil fields that we suspect exist. Let’s query the traditional theory of oil formation. What about the igneous origin of oil? What about the role of meteorite impact on the origin of oil? Let’s apply de Bono’s invention of lateral thinking to the problem , or are you a Greenie and content to accept the religious bunkum promoted by Al Gore? God help America!
Much needs to be done on defining the enormous reserves of oil shales and sands that exist and which in the latter part of this century I predict will be the main source of our petroleum. How best to mine it? Open cut methods no doubt, but how to process it?
We have coal reserves sufficient to last a couple of hundred years, maybe 1000 years. Natural gas reserves too are extensive. R & D needs to concentrate on how better to extract and produce transport fuels, both natural and synthetic, such as gasoline, kerosene, diesel and propane (LPG) so that in future we can fuel our cars, buses, trucks and airplanes.
I feel sure that this is the sensible way ahead out of the energy crisis.
Concurrently, it is very important to conserve (not waste) the hydrocarbon fuels so produced.
Longer term is the need to address the transport infrastructure of major cities. Ideally, people shouldn’t have to drive their cars to work. It is important to have efficient rail, light rail, tram and bus services get people moving around, also having inner city free transport is a good thing. Working at home with a computer link to the office should be encouraged.
I am optimistic for the future because I believe that this bizarre global warming bandwagon will fizzle out within a couple of years. Let’s hope so!

One of the oft-stated “truths” for advocates of the position that humans are predominantly responsible for climate changes is that the Sun could not have played more than a negligible role in the global warming of the last few centuries. Indeed, the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPPC) report theorizes that the long-term solar contribution to climate change has been slightly above zero.

IPCC AR5:


And yet today’s scientists have not been deterred in their quest to document a robust Sun-Climate link in the paleoclimate data… as well as in the temperature and climatic changes for recent decades.  In 2016 alone, for example, there were over 130 scientific papers documenting a non-negligible solar influence on climate.
Climate scientist Dr. Jianyong Li, who has himself authored over 300 peer-reviewed scientific publications, continues this trend of linking climate changes to solar forcing.  He and 13 other scientists just published a new paper in the journal Quaternary Science Reviews in which they have clearly affirmed the dominance of the Sun’s forcing on the climate of China (and for the Northern Hemisphere in general) during the past few thousand years, including the last century.  The authors assert that climate changes and solar activity are well correlated throughout the paleoclimate record, and that if there is a role for greenhouse gases to influence climatic trends, that role is merely supplementary, not dominant.  They also describe in detail how the Sun’s variance acts to influence atmospheric and oceanic heat oscillations, and how this may affect regional precipitation, weather, and temperature changes.

Li et al., 2017
Summary
“We suggest that solar activity may play a key role in driving the climatic fluctuations in NC [North China] during the last 22 centuries, with its quasi ∼100, 50, 23, or 22-year periodicity clearly identified in our climatic reconstructions. … It has been widely suggested from both climate modeling and observation data that solar activity plays a key role in driving late Holocene climatic fluctuations by triggering global temperature variability and atmospheric dynamical circulation (e.g., Haigh, 1996; Shindell et al., 1999; Bond et al., 2001; Fleitmann et al., 2003; Dykoski et al., 2005).”

Climate Changes/Oscillations And Solar Activity Well Correlated For North China, Northern Hemisphere
“Spectral analyses indicate that the PANN [annual precipitation] record has significant periodicities at 100, 67, 57 and 23 years; and the TANN [annual temperature] record displays notable periodicities at 118, 103, 80, 67, 56, 50, 40 and 22 years (Fig. 4). The 100, 57 and 23 year periods for PANN, as well as the 103, 50, and 22 year periods for TANN, correlate well with the 100, 50, 23 and 22 year cycles for the solar activity observed in various solar parameters (e.g., Wilson et al., 1996; Li et al., 1996; Chowdhury et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2014), therefore implying an in-phase relationship between the climatic oscillation in NC [North China] and solar activity. Furthermore, a multidecadal to centennial comparison of our pollen-derived TANN reconstruction for NC with the Total Solar Irradiance (TSI; Vieira et al., 2011), the Asian Pacific Oscillation index (APO; Zhou et al., 2009), the Intertropical Convergence Zone index (ITCZ; Haug et al., 2001), the North Atlantic Oscillation index (NAO; Trouet et al., 2009; Olsen et al., 2012) and the Ice-Rafted Debris record (IRD; Bond et al., 2001) from the North Atlantic Ocean, suggests a strong underlying teleconnection between the EAM [East Asian Monsoon] regime in NC and many other high- or low-latitude climatic systems in different regions of the northern Hemisphere.” 

[Notice there has been no significant net warming in North China since about 1950, consistent with the temperature trends for the Northern Hemisphere in general and similar to the identified pattern in reconstructions of Total Solar Irradiance.]

The Mechanism Of Solar Forcing And Climatic/Oscillatory Changes
“In short, the mechanism of the climatic variations in NC [North China] can be likely summarized as follows.  The strengthened solar activity could be significantly amplified by the variations in ultraviolet radiation as well as clouds (e.g., Haigh, 1996; Tinsley, 2000), resulting in the marked variability in global surface temperature. As the heat capacity between land and ocean differs notably, if TSI increases, the thermal contrast between the East Asian continent and the North Pacific Ocean would be enhanced, resulting in high values of APO and thus northward shift of both ITCZ and Western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH) positions (e.g., Zhao et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 2009), so that the summer monsoon and its rain belt would move further north and stay longer in NC. At the same time, because the increased TSI would lead to decreased IRD values, but increased North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) circulation, and hence a positive NAO phase, the EAM continent including NC would receive less cold air masses from the high-latitude regions of NH and thus be substantially warming up, so that the winter monsoon and westerlies would be concurrently weakened and retreat northward (e.g., Wu and Wang, 2002; Wang et al., 2005; Li et al., 2015a). As a result, the enhanced summer monsoon would bring more rainfall to NC where the surface temperature is also synchronously higher. In contrast, when TSI declines, the EAM land temperature falls quickly, whereas the winter monsoon and westerlies would be intensified, thus leading to increased IRD values, but declining NADW strength as well as a negative NAO phase; and meanwhile the positions of both ITCZ and WPSH would retreat southward, the summer monsoon intensity would be significantly weakened, thereby resulting in the coincidently decreased precipitation as well as temperature in NC.”

CO2 May ‘Partly’ Affect Climate Variations, But Its Role Is Only Superimposed On ‘Solar-Dominated Control’
“Additionally, increased El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) strength (possibly El Niño-like phases) during drying periods, increased volcanic eruptions and the resulting aerosol load during cooling periods, as well as high volumes of greenhouse gases such as CO2 and CH4 during the recent warming periods, may also play a role in partly affecting the climatic variability in NC, superimposing on the overall solar-dominated long-term control (e.g., Wanner et al., 2008; Tan et al., 2011; Kobashi et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2015a,b).”

A Closer Look At The Robust Correlation Between Solar Variability And Modern Climate
In examining the strong correlation between solar variability and temperature changes, notice the reconstruction of Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) supplied in the Li et al. (2017) paper (from Vieira et al., 2011, shown in this article’s leading graph above and now below). TSI trends for the last several centuries indicate a dramatic rise in solar irradiance from the early 20th century until about 1950, then a decline in solar forcing through the 1960s and 1970s, and then another rising TSI trend after the 1980s until the early 2000s.  These trends all correlate rather well with temperature trends not only for China, but for the entire Northern Hemisphere.
Vieira et al., 2011

Even using non-tampered-with instrumental temperature datasets reveal a similar warming-cooling-warming oscillation for the Northern Hemisphere that is compatible with reconstructions of TSI.
Prior to NASA’s elimination of 0.45°C of warming from the 1880s to 1940 period, as well as making 0.3°C of cooling disappear from the 1940 to 1970 trend, the National Academy of Sciences produced a graph (depicted below) indicating there was nearly 1°C of warming between the late 1880s and 1940, and then about -0.5 or -0.6°C of cooling between 1940 and 1975.



And then, since 1979, the RSS sattellite temperature dataset (shown below) indicates that the Northern Hemisphere (NH) has warmed again by about +0.5 or +0.6° C overall since the 1970s, likely recovering completely from the earlier cooling period of similar magnitude (1940 to 1970s).  Since about 2000, the NH trend has been largely flat (until the 2015-’16 Super El Niño warming event). Therefore, using the instrumental records that have likely not been massively adjusted to fit climate models, the 1940s peak and the 2000s plateau are probably similar in warming magnitude.  So, like the paleoclimate reconstructions shown above from Li et al. (2017), even the instrumental record seems to correlate well with the Vieira et al. (2011) TSI reconstruction for the 20th and 21st centuries.


RSS Satellite Graph Climate4you

Because large regions of the Southern Hemisphere (and middle latitudes) have not warmed since the 1970s (regions such as West Antarctica, East Antarctica, Antarctica as a whole, the Southern Ocean, South America, Australia, India, the Indian Ocean …) even global surface temperatures may follow a warming-cooling-warming oscillatory pattern for the 20th century that correlates well with TSI trends.
Gerhard, 2004


A 2014 Paper Also Affirms A Robust Correlation Between TSI And Temperatures
Moffa-Sánchez et al., 2014
“There were several centennial-scale fluctuations in the climate and oceanography of the North Atlantic region over the past 1,000 years, including a period of relative cooling from about AD 1450 to 1850 known as the Little Ice Age. These variations may be linked to changes in solar irradiance, amplified through feedbacks including the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. … The reconstructed centennial-scale variations in hydrography correlate with variability in total solar irradiance. We find a similar correlation in a simulation of climate over the past 1,000 years. [L]ow solar irradiance promotes the development of frequent and persistent atmospheric blocking events, in which a quasi-stationary high-pressure system in the eastern North Atlantic modifies the flow of the westerly winds. … Our results reveal abrupt multidecadal to centennial shifts in the temperature and salinity of the NAC [North Atlantic Current] waters of ∼3.5 °C and ∼1.2 °C, respectively, during the past millennium. The magnitude of the hydrographic variability is substantial and comparable to that recorded in a lower resolution record spanning the present interglacial from a nearby site, which highlights the similarities in the ocean variability on a diverse range of timescales. The timing of the hydrographic shifts shows a strong correlation with total solar irradiance (TSI) variability. Periods of solar minima (maxima) generally correspond to cold and fresh (warm and salty) conditions in the NAC.”


Conclusion
The IPCC has taken the position that the Sun (and natural factors like clouds and aerosols that influence its variable surface energy absorption) has had little to no influence on climate changes in the last few hundred years.  This conceptualization is rooted in the presupposition that humans are primarily — if not exclusively — responsible for Earth’s temperature changes.  Media outlets have taken the cue and headlined stories such as “2016 Was Earth’s Hottest Year on Record, and Humans Are to Blame“.
Considering the large and growing body of scientific evidence linking the Sun to climate variations — even for the 20th and 21st centuries — it is long past due for the IPCC and other influential bodies to take a much closer look at the solar sciences as an explanation for past and present climate changes.

Guest essay by Larry Hamlin
NOAA has updated its extensive U.S. coastal tide gauge data measurement records (http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/sltrends_us.htm) to include data through year 2015. These measurements include tide gauge data coastal locations  for 25 West Coast,  Gulf Coast and East Coast states along the Pacific Ocean, Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean. In addition 7 Pacific island groups and 6 Atlantic island groups also have coastal location tide gauge data measurements updated as well.
In all more than 200 coastal locations are included in these measurements with more than 100 of these coastal locations with recorded data periods in excess of 50 years in duration. None of these updated NOAA tide gauge measurement data records show coastal location sea level rise acceleration occurring anywhere on the U.S. coasts or Pacific or Atlantic  island groups.
In June of 1988 testimony was provided before Congress by various scientists, including NASA’s Dr. James Hansen, claiming that  man made greenhouse gas emissions were responsible for increasing global temperatures with the the New York Times reporting  (http://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/24/us/global-warming-has-begun-expert-tells-senate.html?pagewanted=all )  “Global Warming Has Begun, Experts Tells Senate”.
The Times article noted that “The rise in global temperature is predicted to cause a thermal expansion of the oceans and to melt glaciers and polar ice, thus causing sea levels to rise by one to four feet by the middle of the next century. Scientists  have already detected a slight rise in sea levels.”
Its now been 28 years since the conjecture of these early sea level rise climate alarmist claims was presented to Congress. However the latest updated NOAA coastal tide gauge measurement data shows locations likely to experience only inches of sea level rise by mid century (not one to four feet as climate alarmists speculated to Congress in 1998) with that increase consistent with long standing and unchanging rates of sea level rise measured at these coastal locations. The longest NOAA tide gauge data record is at the Battery, New York with a 160 year long measurement period. This location along with all other U.S. coastal locations show no sea level rise acceleration.
Climate alarmists continue to try and mislead the public by claiming  that the Statue of Liberty is in “imminent jeopardy” because of rising sea levels but the unchanging rate of sea level rise present at the Battery would require more than 20,000 years to cover the base (https://wattsupwiththat.com/2013/08/20/national-geographics-junk-science-how-long-will-it-take-for-sea-level-rise-to-reach-midway-up-the-statue-of-liberty/). That time period hardly qualifies as “imminent jeopardy”.

Additionally NOAA performs 95% confidence interval analysis of each location to determine if there are significant changes in the tide gauge measurement trends over time.

NOAA analysis of these 95% confidence interval ranges is stated as “Although the mean trend may change from year to year, there is no statistically significant difference between the calculated trends if their 95% confidence intervals overlap. Therefore, the most recent calculated trend is not necessarily more accurate than the previous trends; it is merely a little more precise. If several recent years have anomalously high or low water levels, the values may actually move slightly away from the true long-term linear trend”.
The 95% confidence interval analysis demonstrates that the linear sea level rise trend is stable and unchanging. This 95% confidence interval analysis is available for all NOAA tide gauge coastal location measurements.
In a May 15, 2016 Rutgers University graduation address President Obama told the assembled gathering (https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/05/15/remarks-president-commencement-address-rutgers-state-university-new) that “in politics and in life, ignorance is not a virtue. It’s not cool to not know what your talking about.”
Yet Obama had told the country in his Democratic nomination acceptance speech on June 3, 2008 (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/06/03/obamas-nomination-victory_n_105028.html) that we would be able to look back upon his nomination and tell our children that “this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal”.
Besides the monumental hubris of this statement it is apparent that President Obama was ignorant of the fact that the oceans have been rising for thousands of years since the end of the last ice age.
The rates of ocean sea level change have varied significantly over this time period with more recent studies showing greater detail of ocean sea level change information over about the last two hundred years. These changes in ocean sea level have occurred as a result of natural climate events as clearly shown in information (slide #36) from a recent presentation (https://curryja.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/spe-curry-final.pdf) by Dr. Judith Curry regarding global climate science issues.

Additionally it is apparent that President Obama was ignorant of the fact that based on more than 100 NOAA long time period measured coastal tide gauge data records coastal locations were shown not to be experiencing acceleration of sea level rise.
President Obama has made numerous claims of coastal sea level rise acceleration at various U.S. locations  but none of these claims is supported by NOAA tide gauge measurement data (
https://wattsupwiththat.com/2014/07/16/latest-noaa-mean-sea-level-trend-data-through-2013-confirms-lack-of-sea-level-rise-acceleration-2/).
Perhaps President Obama might be interested in the latest coastal sea level rise tide gauge measurement data from Washington D.C. where  he has resided for the last 8 years and for Honolulu, Hawaii where he was born.
NOAA tide gauge data shows the 91 year long Washington D. C. coastal location measurement period with an unchanging 1 foot per century rate of increase and the 110 year long Honolulu, Hawaii coastal location measurement period with an unchanging 5.5 inches per century rate of increase. President Obama’s  claims of accelerating coastal sea level rise threatening U.S. locations is based on ignorance. As the President has said “It’s not cool to not know what your talking about.”


President Obama is not alone in being ignorant about ocean and coastal sea level rise concepts, information and data.
Climate alarmist media often carry scientifically flawed stories alleging impending coastal sea level rise catastrophe supposedly being driven by man made CO2 emissions. These flawed news reports many times reflect information provided the by Obama Administration national climate assessment effort through the report “Global Sea Level Rise Scenarios for the United States National Climate Assessment” (http://cpo.noaa.gov/sites/cpo/Reports/2012/NOAA_SLR_r3.pdf).

This report presents various scenarios claiming that global mean sea level rise by 2100 will range between 8 inches to 6.6 feet. The mid range of the scenarios is about 3 feet of global mean sea level rise by the year 2100.
The alleged purpose of the report is to “help” local cities and communities “plan” for future sea level rise that could impact  their locations. The report contains the following huge qualifications and limitations regarding the validity and applicability of these scenarios at specific local coastal cities and communities:


“Scenarios do not predict future changes, but describe future potential conditions in a manner that supports decision-making under conditions of uncertainty”.
“Probabilistic projections of future conditions are another form of scenarios not used in this report because this method remains an area of active research. No widely accepted method is currently available for producing probabilistic projections of sea level rise at actionable scales”.
“Thus, specific probabilities or likelihoods are not assigned to individual scenarios in this report, and none of these scenarios should be used in isolation”.
“None of these scenarios should be used in isolation, and experts and coastal managers should factor in locally and regionally specific information on climatic, physical, ecological, and biological processes and on the culture and economy of coastal communities.”
“Scientific observations at the local and regional scale are essential to action, and long-term coastal management actions (e.g. coastal habitat restoration) are sensitive to near-term rates and amounts of SLR.”


Exactly how local communities and cities are supposed to use these scenarios for local sea level rise “planning” purposes given these incredible limitations is unexplained.
Also unaddressed in the “National Climate Assessment” report is any explicit discussion of the huge difference between “global mean sea level” and “local sea level” (also called relative sea level) concerning  how these vastly different sea level rise data measurements apply or don’t apply at specific coastal locations. .
NOAA clearly notes (http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/faq.htm#q1) that “There is an important distinction between the global sea level trend and relative sea level trends (based on local sea level measurements), which must be understood in order to interpret changes to a coastline or particular location, and to properly apply the information”.
The University of Colorado sea level research group which uses satellites to measure global mean sea level  for making estimates of ocean sea level clearly states ((http://sealevel.colorado.edu/faq#n3134)) that satellite global mean sea level measurements “”cannot be used to predict relative sea level changes along the coasts”.

Instead the University of Colorado notes that “”Local tide gauges measure the sea level at a single location relative to the local land surface, a measurement referred to as “relative sea level” (RSL)”
For sea level rise planning purposes local coastal cities and communities need to rely upon NOAA tide gauge data with measurements of coastal sea level rise at specific local and related regional locations to address what kinds of sea level increases should be expected. Global mean sea level data and estimates are not applicable at specific coastal locations and inappropriate for use for local coastal planning purposes.
Southern California has some of the world’s most beautiful and expensive coastal communities on the planet including locations at Long Beach, Seal Beach, Huntington Beach, Newport Beach, Corona del Mar, Laguna Beach and Monarch Beach. The rate of sea level rise at these coastal locations is very important to these communities economic well being and to issues of property protection and enjoyment for the businesses and people that work and live in these communities.
A local newspaper the Orange County Register published two articles on April 24, 2016 (http://www.ocregister.com/articles/sea-713335-rise-level.html), (http://www.ocregister.com/articles/focus-713037-levels-rise.html) alleging that because of CO2 caused global warming the earth’s sea level rise is accelerating and could increase by 3 feet by the year 2100 and inundate local southern California coastal areas causing significant damage to Southern California coastal communities.
These stories based their sea level rise information on the “National Climate Assessment” report and incorrectly applied the mid range scenario to Long Beach, Newport Beach and Huntington Beach. Additionally the articles failed to make any mention of the huge qualifications and limitations of the National Assessment reports global sea level rise scenarios.

There are four NOAA long time period tide gauge sea level rise measurement locations in the Southern California region located at San Diego (http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/sltrends_station.shtml?stnid=9410170), La Jolla (http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/sltrends_station.shtml?stnid=9410230), Los Angeles (http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/sltrends_station.shtml?stnid=9410660) and Santa Monica (http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/sltrends_station.shtml?stnid=9410840).

The NOAA tide gauge data for these locations which covers time periods from more than 80 to over 100 years ago through 2015 data measurements shows that there is no sea level rise acceleration taking place at these locations and that the rate of sea level rise is stable and between 3 to 9 inches per century at these locations not the 3 feet proclaimed in the alarmist article. This NOAA tide gauge data should have been discussed and presented in these Register articles.
NOAA 95% level of confidence analysis shows that there have been no significant changes in the rate of sea level rise at these Southern California locations during the long time period of these measurements. These 95% level of confidence intervals  for the specific Southern California coastal locations are available at (http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/sltrends_update.htm?stnid=9410170), (http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/sltrends_update.htm?stnid=9410230), (http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/sltrends_update.htm?stnid=9410660), and (http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/sltrends_update.htm?stnid=9410840).
The climate alarmist news media have done a terrible job addressing the valid issues and information about sea level rise acceleration to the public. Much of what is written about this topic is inaccurate, misleading and erroneous. The media appear to have gone out of their way to ignore NOAA tide gauge data and instead incorrectly based alarmist sea level rise stories on inappropriate use of global mean sea level measurements and computer estimates and forecasts.
A recent study published in the Ocean & Coastal Management Journal (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0964569116300205) addressed the importance of using only tide gauge data for coastal planning not speculative global mean sea level estimates derived from ocean computer models using satellite sea level measurements.
Climate scientist Dr. Judith Curry presented some of the results of this paper (https://judithcurry.com/2016/02/23/is-sea-level-rise-accelerating/) which included the following assessment of how communities should evaluate coastal sea level rise issues:
The network of tide gauges provides the only information of value for costal planning.
The worldwide naïve average of sea level is +0.24 mm/year with no acceleration.
The climate models have crucial flaws making them useless.
Planning schemes must only reflect the proven local and global historical data.
 
Further supporting the importance of using local sea level rise tide gauge measurements for coastal location planning needs NOAA clearly states that “Relative Sea Level Trends reflect changes in local sea level over time and are typically the most critical sea level trend for many coastal applications, including coastal mapping, marine boundary delineation, coastal zone management, coastal engineering, sustainable habitat restoration design, and the general public enjoying their favorite beach”.
 
Unfortunately misleading, erroneous and inaccurate information about sea level rise issues is often used by climate alarmists to try and make their case. Extensive NOAA tide  gauge data measured at hundreds of coastal locations around the U.S.many with measurement periods longer than 100 years  do not support claims of coastal sea level rise acceleration.
NOAA tide gauge data represents an extremely important scientific resource to address specific coastal location sea level rise issues. The real story about coastal sea level rise contained in this critical data needs to be told.

The Week That Was: 2016-02-27 (February 27, 2016) Brought to You by SEPP (www.SEPP.org) The Science and Environmental Policy Project
THIS WEEK: By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP)
Power Plan; Science Argument: SEPP Chairman Fred Singer and Vice President Tom Sheahen joined eleven other distinguished scientists in filing a “Brief of Amici Curiae Scientists in Support of Petitioners Supporting Reversal” in the case of State of West Virginia, State of Texas, et al. v. EPA. This is the case in which the Supreme Court issued a stay on the Administration’s plan, called the Clean Power Plan, to control how electricity is generated in the United States primarily by regulating carbon dioxide emissions. The unusual judicial stay stops the implementation of the Administration’s plan until it has undergone judicial review, which will take several years. The stay was discussed in the February 13 TWTW.
As of now, the steps appear to be first a hearing before a three judge panel of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The oral arguments are scheduled for June 2, 2016, with a decision to be announced some time thereafter. Whichever party loses that round will probably appeal for an “en banc” hearing by the entire court, which results in a further delay.
Whichever party loses that round will probably appeal for a ruling by the Supreme Court, which may accept, deny, or delay the case – another delay. If it passes judicial review, the Administration’s power plan, which some call the unreliable electricity plan because it promotes wind and solar at the expense of reliable forms of electricity generation, will not take effect until well after Mr. Obama has left office. Because the power plan is only a regulatory action of the executive branch, it could be changed or reversed by a future president. To the extent possible within the confines of legal appeal, the above mentioned brief addresses three deficient lines of evidence that EPA used to justify its finding that human greenhouse gas emissions, mainly carbon dioxide (CO2), endanger human health and welfare (Endangerment Finding).
First, the brief asserts the “Empirical Data Show EPA’s Tropical Hot Spot Theory to Be Invalid.” As explained in previous TWTWs, the EPA claimed the tropical hot spot (an atmospheric warming trend centered at about 33,000 feet, 10KM, with more pronounced warming than surface warming) is the distinct human fingerprint. [EPA’s claim itself is false, such a hot spot should exist regardless of the source of the warming.] The brief presents tropical atmospheric data at 12 km (39,400 feet) from balloons, and surface to 18 km (59,000 feet) from satellites. No statistically significant trends, positive or negative, exist between 1979 to 2011. The Hot Spot cannot be found.
[Note: According to historian Bernie Lewin, the hot spot was invented, without empirical support, at the 1995 UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scientific conference in Madrid by Benjamin Santer and promoted by IPCC Chairman John Houghton. This became a turning point for IPCC. https://enthusiasmscepticismscience.wordpress.com/2015/11/21/remembering-madrid-95-a-meeting-that-changed-the-world-2/#more-1838]
Second, the brief asserts that “Empirical Data Show EPA’s Record Setting, Global Warming Claim to Be Invalid.” According to the brief, the warming has been regional, not global. The most significant warming of the lower troposphere has been in the Northern Hemisphere, north of 20 deg. north latitude. The Arctic has warmed but the Antarctic has cooled, slightly. Further, the tropical oceans have not warmed. Further, there has been no statistically significant warming north of 20 deg. north since 1998.
Third, the brief asserts that “Empirical Data Invalidate EPA’s Claim That Cited Climate Models May Be Relied Upon for its Policy Analysis Purposes.” The brief compares models used in IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report (AR-4, 2007) with the HadCRUT4 2000-2014 trends which shows the forecasts greatly overestimated surface temperature trends. Even the model “Commit-Stop CO2” scenario which assumes draconian curtailment of CO2 emissions to 1992 levels overestimates the surface temperature trends.
The brief states that the lines of evidence the EPA relied on are invalid. Further, the brief asserts that “Ongoing and Biased Data Manipulation Have Made the Instrumental Surface Data (1850 to Date) No Longer Credible.
In the view of TWTW, without the EPA’s endangerment finding, the Administration has no logical or empirical justification for imposing a power plan that will destroy an industry that has delivered reliable electricity, however imperfectly, since 1882, over 130 years. The general health issues of coal-fired power plants have been solved in the US. Health issues in India, China, etc. do not apply. Proper disposal of coal-ash is needed. Modern coal-fired plants, such as the ultra-super-critical plants, promise greater efficiencies with fewer general-recognized pollutants. However, the Administration opposes them. The Administration is fighting a battle already passed. Further, until electricity storage is available on an affordable, commercial scale, wind and solar, promoted in the Administration’s power plan, will remain expensive, unreliable, and unsuitable for a modern civilization. See link under Litigation Issues, particularly Appendices 1, 2, and 3 of the Scientists’ brief.

Power Plan; Separation of Powers Argument: Two other briefs in the case against the Administration’s power plan merit additional comment. The presenters of the brief by Peabody Energy, a coal company, included Laurence Tribe, a professor of constitutional Law at Harvard Law School who was a judicial adviser in Mr. Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign. Mr. Tribe is the author of a highly influential textbook, “American Constitutional Law.” The second brief is by the Southeastern Legal Foundation, a Georgia-based, independent public interest law firm, which advocates human rights and limited government.
Both briefs asserted that the Administration’s power plan violated the Constitutional doctrine of separation of powers. The doctrine can be viewed from several levels. At the Federal level, the issue is that the powers of Congress (legislative) are different from the powers of the President (executive). The briefs assert that the EPA (the executive) does not have the legal authority (granted by the legislative) to implement the Administration’s power plan.
Another level of viewing the doctrine of separation of powers is distinguishing between the powers granted to the Federal Government in the Constitution and those reserved for the States, or to the people. This doctrine is particularly found in the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution and is embodied in the concept of Federalism. [Note that the powers of government are different from the rights of the people, which are the subject of the Ninth Amendment.]
In what promises to be a long engagement, observers will be treated to what may become an important lesson in Constitutional Law and the formation of the Federal Government. See links under Litigation Issues
******************
Justice Scalia: Adding to the complexity of the issue, Associate Justice Antonin Scalia died suddenly on February 13. There has been a great deal of speculation on what will happen to the Administration’s power plan and other measures. This speculation has been accompanied by considerable misinformation, such as that the judicial process will be paralyzed until his seat is filled. Legal scholars have pointed out that since World War II, there have been 15 periods when the court had only eight justices, yet the system did not falter. The longest period was between May 1945 and October 1946, when Justice Jackson served as chief prosecutor at the Nuremberg Tribunals.
Further, those who give political labels to justices call Justice Scalia a conservative, which may be correct. However legal scholars offer numerous counterexamples. He “joined with liberals to demand due process for Guantanamo detainees, to protect flag-burning (and cross-burning), to give new teeth to procedural protections for criminal defendants.” In short, he was not dogmatic. But he greatly influenced the court. “Today, the entire court—even the liberal justices—have adopted Justice Scalia’s style: close attention to text, awareness of history, analytical rigor.” See Articles # 3 and # 4.
******************
A New Form of Modeling? Climate models are performing poorly when compared with observations. Economic forecasting did the same when they were based on complex macroeconomic models. Writing for the Global Warming Policy Foundation, Terence Mills, an eminent British Economics Professor, has proposed using statistical time-series forecasting methods to improve climate forecasting.
Economist Ross McKitrick, one of the two who demolished Mann’s hockey-stick, wrote the foreward to the proposal. In terms of policy issues, it may have merit because it can serve as an independent check on projections from climate models.
However, electronic measurement pioneer John Brignell offers a note of caution. “Statistical methods. from simple line fitting to elaborate analyses, tell you nothing about mechanisms and causality, though they can sometimes provide hints that prompt further investigation.”
“Any form of statistical analysis is inherently sensitive to the quality of data and its generation. There are many reasons for avoiding ‘traditional’ surface temperature data as a source. The sensors are badly distributed and often poorly sited. There is massive evidence that the data have been corrupted by human intervention throughout the gathering process and then subjected to questionable post hoc ‘adjustments’.”
The major issue is that the proposed process does not lead to understanding of natural drivers of climate variability – particularly the sun.
“As with the physical models, apart from the usual dubieties, there is always the haunting presence of the dominant driver; The Sun. Virtually ignoring this has been a rather outrageous feature of physical models. The cross-correlation between solar radiation and alleged global temperature would suggest itself as a proper starting point for any statistical approach.”
One may expand the cross-correlation to include total solar energy (solar wind and magnetism) to be calculated along with atmospheric temperatures. See links under Model Issues.
******************
Pause – No Pause? A group of researchers from the Climate Establishment, including Michael Mann and Benjamin Santer, mentioned above, have a paper in Nature arguing that the Tom Karl, et al. June 2014 paper in Science was biased. The Karl, et al. paper argues there was no hiatus (pause) in surface temperature trends. Writing in Reason, Ron Bailey brings together the apparent contradictions between Nature and Science, or between Mann and Karl. Let the fun begin. See links under Measurement Issues – Surface.
******************
Consensus – No Consensus? Pierre Gosselin of No Tricks Zone presents two lists of peer reviewed papers which he states cast doubts on the claim that human emissions of greenhouse gases, namely CO2, are causing significant global warming/climate change. One list is for 2015, the second for 2016. TWTW has not reviewed listed papers and cannot comment on the extent to which these papers refute the “orthodox science” of the IPCC and its followers. However, such lists call into question surveys that are used to frequently claim that “97% of climate scientists ….” The surveys reviewed by TWTW show that the claims are more based on opinions of the surveyors than on objective polling, which requires that the opinions of the surveyors do not influence the results of the survey.
******************
Sea Level Rise: Rising sea levels are a major concern. In the past, sea level rise has eliminated cultures along the Persian Gulf and facilities around the Mediterranean Sea. Unfortunately, some scientists play on this concern by exaggerating the threat. There is a prevailing issue in measurement. Tidal gages indicate a rise of about 2 mm per year for most of the 20th century. More recent measurements by satellites and buoys indicate a rise of 3 mm per year.
The differences from types of measurements do not mean that the rise is accelerating. It may mean that the two systems are not fully calibrated and need to be adjusted accordingly. Thus, recent headlines that sea level rise is accelerating may not be correct.
None of this justifies statements from certain entities of NOAA (updated on Nov 4, 2015) that asserted: “In 2012, at the request of the U.S. Climate Change Science Program, NOAA scientists conducted a review of the research on global sea level rise projections, and concluded that there is very high confidence (greater than 90% chance) that global mean sea level will rise at least 8 inches (0.2 meter) but no more than 6.6 feet (2.0 meters) by 2100.” [Boldface added.] If this is the best NOAA can do, it is an embarrassment to government scientific work! See links under Changing Seas.
******************
TWTW in Transition: At the suggestion of physicist Donald Rapp, and others, TWTW will be preparing an index of scientific issues discussed. Beginning in this TWTW and evolving in the future, TWTW will present topics such as Measurement Issues by type: Surface, Atmospheric, Tropics, Missing Heat, Energy Flow, CO2 and Temperatures. Further it will have topics such as Other Climate Change Drivers, Climate Sensitivity, and Climate Change – Cultures and Civilizations. These changes will promote searching topics on the SEPP web site.

Number of the Week: 169. Bjørn Lomborg writes that the UN has 169 new Sustainable Development Goals. Is this an example when too much of something becomes nothing? See link under Questioning the Orthodoxy.

“However, the analysis of today’s post was impossible until recently because coauthor Luckman withheld relevant measurement data for over a decade. One of the retorts to the present analysis will undoubtedly be that I’m wasting my time dissecting a decade-old paper, because the field has “moved on” (all too often to still unarchived data (e.g. most of the component series of Wilson et al. 2016) which, if the past is any guide, may not be available for another decade.”

The UN isn’t going to sanction the U.S. if the Clean Power Plan is binned, and this lack of an enforceability mechanism is one of the key problems with any international approach to climate change.

Review of Recent Scientific Articles by CO2 Science
The Mass Balance of Antarctica’s Dronning Maud Land Ice Sheet
Callens, D., Thonnard, N., Lenaerts, J.T.M., Van Wessem, J.M., Van De Berg, W.J., Matsuoka, K. and Pattyn, F. 2015. Mass balance of the Sor Rondane glacial system, East Antarctica. Annals of Glaciology 56: 63-69. Feb 19, 2016
http://www.co2science.org/articles/V19/feb/a12.php
“These efforts ultimately revealed that this particular part of Antarctica has recently been gaining about 3.15 billion tons of new ice each year, which phenomenon obviously tends to temper the current rate of sea level rise.”

N Fixation and Growth of Cyanobacteria in CO2-Enriched Sea Water
Hutchins, D.A., Walworth, N.G., Webb, E.A., Saito, M.A., Moran, D., Mcllvin, M.R., Gale, J. and Fu, F.-X. 2015. Irreversibly increased nitrogen fixation in Trichodesmium experimentally adapted to elevated carbon dioxide. Nature Communications: 10.1038/ncomms9155. Feb 16, 2016
http://www.co2science.org/articles/V19/feb/a10.php
“experimental evolution under extended selection at projected future elevated CO2 levels results in irreversible, large increases in nitrogen fixation and growth rates, even after being moved back to lower present-day CO2 levels for hundreds of generations.”
Climate Change in Northern Europe as per CMIP2, 3 and 5 Models
Raisanen, J. and Ylhaisi, J.S. 2015. CO2-induced climate change in northern Europe: CMIP2 versus CMIP3 versus CMIP5. Climate Dynamics 45: 1877-1897. Feb 15, 2016
http://www.co2science.org/articles/V19/feb/a9.php
“The two researchers from Finland’s University of Helsinki report that (1) ‘control simulations in the three ensembles share similar biases,’ which generally include (2) ‘colder-than-observed temperatures’ and (3) ‘an underestimated north-south pressure gradient across northern Europe.’
“In light of these unfortunate findings, they thus write that ‘the manpower and other resources dedicated to model development in the past 10-15 years seem to have had little effect on the end product that ultimately matters the most for users of climate model data.’
A 2000-Year SST History of the Northeastern Arabian Sea
Munz, P.M., Siccha, M., Luckge, A., Boll, A., Kucera, M. and Schulz, H. 2015. Decadal-resolution record of winter monsoon intensity over the last two millennia from planktic foraminiferal assemblages in the northeastern Arabian Sea. The Holocene 25: 1756-1771., Feb 26, 2016
http://www.co2science.org/articles/V19/feb/a16.php
“The significance of these observations lies primarily in the fact that they provide yet another demonstration of the existence of two multi-century periods of time — the Medieval and Roman Warm Periods — when the earth was significantly warmer than it is currently, and at times when the atmosphere’s CO2 concentration was significantly less than what it is today.”
“winter temperatures were more than 1.5°C warmer than today,” prior to 100 AD
A Thousand-Year Drought History of China’s Qilian Mountains
Gou, X., Deng, Y., Gao, L., Chen, F., Cook, E., Yang, M. and Zhang, F. 2015. Millennium tree-ring reconstruction of drought variability in the eastern Qilian Mountains, northwest China. Climate Dynamics 45: 1761-1770.
http://www.co2science.org/articles/V19/feb/a15.php
“Consequently, and in consideration of the findings of all of the studies cited above, it can safely be concluded that the preponderance of real-world evidence from the noted locations in Asia does not support the climate-alarmist claim that global warming leads to the occurrence of either more frequent or more severe droughts. In fact — and in near unanimity — just the opposite is found to be the case: warming tends to lead to less frequent and less severe drought conditions.”

Rainfall Forecasts Should be Benchmarked [AU]
By Jennifer Marohasy, Her Blog, Feb 23, 2016 [H/t Jo Nova]
http://jennifermarohasy.com/2016/02/rainfall-forecasts-should-be-benchmarked/
The Bureau of Meteorology increasingly use their weather and climate forecasts to warn of looming catastrophe. This use of ‘forecasts’ to advance an agenda is common in politics, but it’s not something the Bureau should be engaged in.
A key Bureau goal should be the best possible rainfall forecast for the public.
[SEPP Comment: In business, benchmarking can be defined as comparing one’s performance with those of competitors by using selected numerical measurements. In climate science, it can be used to determine which models perform best against observations – in general it is not used.]

From the abstract: “The framework illustrates that unreliable climate simulations are prone to overestimate the attributable risk to climate change. Climate model ensembles tend to be overconfident in their representation of the climate variability which leads to systematic increase in the attributable risk to an extreme event.”

Is Oregon STILL in Severe Drought?
By Cliff Mass, Weather Blog, Feb 21, 2016

Link to essay: Economics: Current climate models are grossly misleading
Nicholas Stern calls on scientists, engineers and economists to help policymakers by better modelling the immense risks to future generations, and the potential for action.
By Nicholas Stern, Nature, Feb 25, 2016
http://www.nature.com/news/economics-current-climate-models-are-grossly-misleading-1.19416
[SEPP Comment: Stern avoids the question: have the risks faced by future generations increased or decreased? Has he devised a way to predict future technologies? “There is huge potential in future technologies that can drive change. These are omitted or badly underestimated in our current climate modelling — deeply damaging our guidance for policymaking.”]

Link to press release on the paper: Will we ever stop using fossil fuels?
Not without a carbon tax, suggests a study by an MIT economist.
By Peter Dizikes, MIT News Office, Feb 24, 2016
http://news.mit.edu/2016/carbon-tax-stop-using-fossil-fuels-0224
From press release: “The study concludes that burning all available fossil fuels would raise global average temperatures 10 to 15 degrees Fahrenheit by the year 2100; burning oil shale and methane hydrates, two more potential sources of copious fossil fuels, would add another 1.5 to 6.2 degrees Fahrenheit to that.”
‘The scholars examine costs over a time frame of five to 10 years, stating that further forecasts would be quite speculative, although the trend of cheaper fossil fuels could continue longer.”
[SEPP Comment: No link to paper. The analysis is quite speculative. The press release contains another plea for a carbon tax and ignores the critical problem, storing electricity on an affordable, commercial scale.]

Link to paper: Future cost-competitive electricity systems and their impact on US CO2 emissions
By MacDonald, Clack, Alexander, Dunbar, Wilczak & Xie, Nature Climate Change, Jan 25, 2016
http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nclimate2921.html
From abstract: Our results show that when using future anticipated costs for wind and solar, carbon dioxide emissions from the US electricity sector can be reduced by up to 80% relative to 1990 levels, without an increase in the levelized cost of electricity.
From the base report: Since the sun is shining or winds are blowing somewhere across the United States all of the time, MacDonald theorized that the key to resolving the dilemma of intermittent renewable generation might be to scale up the renewable energy generation system to match the scale of weather systems.”
[SEPP Comment: One issue is “future anticipated costs” and a second issue is predicting a sudden drop in production which triggers a demand for back-up. Both low costs and reliability have been over-promised and under delivered.]

1. The Paris Climate Accord: Hope, Change – and Collapse
By S. Fred Singer, American Thinker, Feb 23, 2016
http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/02/paris_climate_accord_hope_change__and_collapse.html
SUMMARY: The Paris Accord on global warming, concluded in December 2015, had been viewed as an enhancement of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. But only some weeks later, the Supreme Court of the US effectively “killed” EPA’s power plan, the centerpiece of the US commitment to the Paris Accord, by placing a “stay” on the implementation of the power plan.

2. Methane Leaks: Major Distraction, Minor Ill
Costly federal regulation of methane could be counterproductive to the goal of reducing U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions.
By S. Fred Singer, Letter, WSJ, Feb 15, 2016
http://www.wsj.com/articles/methane-leaks-major-distraction-minor-ill-1455557976
AS SUBMITTED:
The regs proposed by EPA [WSJ, Jan 22, and Krupp op-ed, Feb 3, 2016] to cut methane emitted by flared and leaked gas have no basis in science.
While it is true that each molecule shows strong infrared (IR) absorption bands — and therefore CH4 qualifies (in theory) to be called a “greenhouse” (GH) gas — its actual climate impact is essentially zero — for three independent reasons:
1. The number of molecules is too small — only 1% of CO2 and only 0.01% of water vapor (WV), the most important atmospheric GH gas
2. Absorption by strong IR bands of WV overlaps (“shades”) those of CH4
3. There is only a minor amount of energy in the IR emission from the Earth’s surface in the region of CH4 absorption bands.
There are of course valid economic reasons for fixing leaks. But the proposed EPA regs will have no perceptible effect on global climate, constitute a complete waste of resources, and put a heavy economic burden on the energy industry – with all costs, like any tax, passed along to consumers who can least afford them. However, they clearly demonstrate EPA’s lack of scientific expertise in fashioning regulations. Courts that normally “defer” to EPA should pay attention to this example.

3. Antonin Scalia Was Democracy’s Legal Champion
He changed the way judges looked at text and law, and he was the best writer the Supreme Court has ever known.
By Michael McConnell, WSJ, Feb 14, 2016
http://www.wsj.com/articles/antonin-scalia-was-democracys-legal-champion-1455482790?mod=djemMER
SUMMARY: Mr. McConnell is a law professor and the director of the Constitutional Law Center at Stanford Law School, and is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution. He writes:
Antonin Scalia, who died Saturday at age 79, was the most influential Supreme Court justice of the past 30 years. Not because he had the votes. He was influential because he had a clear, consistent, persuasive idea of how to interpret the Constitution: It means what it says; it means what those who enacted it meant to enact. 
And Justice Scalia was influential because he wrote opinions with verve and good sense, in prose that any American could read and understand. He was the best writer the Supreme Court has ever known—and with justices like John Marshall, Oliver Wendell Holmes and Robert Jackson, that is saying a lot. He was the court’s most withering logician. He showed us what a real judge can be, even on that most political court.
As a law professor, I find it a joy to teach a Scalia opinion. His opinions make clear their premises. They follow logically. Sometimes students point out that Justice Scalia is not being true to his principles. That is a compliment, because it means he has principles that can be identified and objectively applied.
“…But text and history are about more than fastidious jurisprudence. They are about democracy: allowing Americans to decide contentious questions for themselves, where the Constitution is, honestly read, silent.
“As Justice Scalia wrote in Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992), ‘if in reality our process of constitutional adjudication consists primarily of making value judgments,’ instead of ‘doing essentially lawyers’ work up here—reading text and discerning our society’s traditional understanding of that text,” then the issue is properly one for democratic debate. “The people know that their value judgments are quite as good as those taught in any law school—maybe better.” After all, he wrote, ‘value judgments should be voted on, . . . not dictated.’ 
“This is fundamental. If constitutional controversies are governed by discernible law, there is a good reason to allow judges to make the decision. That is what judges do: They interpret and apply laws made by the delegates and representatives of the people at some time in the past. 
“True, the results of his text-and-history approach were often conservative. He believed in a colorblind Constitution; he saw no basis in the Constitution for abortion rights; he defended the presence of religion in the public square; he defended the right to keep and bear arms; and he opposed congressional attempts to regulate campaign speech. 
“On every one of those issues, he offered reasons based on text and history, never on his own philosophy or moral intuitions. He may have been wrong on some of them—I certainly disagreed with more than a few of my former law professor’s constitutional positions—but he reached his interpretations in good faith, as a judge and not as a philosopher-king. He deserves great credit for that.
“Justice Scalia’s opinions, especially his dissents, scintillated with wit, blistered with scorn and often soared with appreciation for our constitutional heritage. No one brought more laughter to oral arguments or more trepidation to oral advocates. Sometimes he went too far. But he made his mark. As a result of his three decades on the Supreme Court bench, constitutional law more closely resembles what the Constitution actually says. The American people had their democratic champion. He will be sorely missed.”

4. Only Eight Justices? So What
A Supreme Court vacancy doesn’t make the justice system grind to a halt. History shows that it merely delays rulings in a small number of cases.
By Josh Blackman and Ilya Shapiro, WSJ, Feb 23, 2016
http://www.wsj.com/articles/only-eight-justices-so-what-1456272088
SUMMARY: Mr. Blackman is a constitutional law professor at the South Texas College of Law. Mr. Shapiro is a senior fellow in constitutional studies at the Cato Institute. Both have filed briefs on Cato’s behalf in pending Supreme Court cases.
The authors discuss numerous instances and cases that were decided when there were only 8 jurists on the Supreme Court. The authors conclude:
“This history shows that today’s court is more than capable of doing its work with eight justices. By far the majority of cases the Roberts court decides aren’t closely contested. Last term only 19 of the 74 decided cases went 5-4. Of those, Justice Scalia was in the majority only six times. Yet regardless of what happens in any particular case, Justice Scalia’s absence—while a huge loss for the nation—hardly hampers the functioning of the Supreme Court even if his seat remains vacant until after the election.”

"Congratulations to Paul Howes of the AWU for fingering the vested interests of the banks in promoting Emissions Trading.
But don’t forget the lawyers, accountants, auditors, regulators, bureaucrats, merchant banks, stock brokers, option traders, climate modellers, wind promoters and cynical politicians, all lined up to benefit from grovelling to green extremists and creating a new sub-prime market trading in hot air. 
But we need to look further than that. Not only will carbon taxes decimate real industry, they are also completely unnecessary. 
There is no scientific or empirical evidence to support the view that carbon dioxide controls climate. Just computer models like those that failed to forecast the market meltdowns.
Climate change is always occurring, and is controlled by factors far bigger than man’s activities. We are faced with an economic recession, and soon will face a food crisis caused by natural climate change and stupid policies like mandating the use of grains for car fuel instead of for food.
Australia should make ZERO offerings to the religious revival meeting in Poznan. 
Stay home, reduce our flying footprint and look after real jobs producing real things not spruikers, spivs and speculators seeking to create a new financial house of credits.

"It’s far easier to avoid burning fossil fuels than it is to clean up CO₂ emissions once they’re in the Earth’s atmosphere. But the world no longer has the luxury of choice – drastic emission reductions and rapid CO₂ removal and storage will both be necessary to avoid the worst impacts of global heating. What if, instead of wasting all that CO₂, it could be turned into something useful? There’s currently little economic incentive for industries that emit CO₂ to capture it, let alone to draw it directly down from the atmosphere. Identifying valuable products and how to make them might kickstart CO₂ removal on an industrial scale, and help bring down emissions in the process. In our recent paper, we set out to clarify what these processes and products might be.   


      Read more:
      CO₂ shortage: why can't we just pull carbon dioxide out of the air?


 We considered processes that use CO₂ captured from industrial emissions, and also biological processes that can directly draw down CO₂ from the air. We projected that between one and ten gigatonnes of CO₂ could be utilised per year by 2050, at costs of under USD$100 (£77) per tonne of CO₂. Humans currently emit 37 gigatonnes of CO₂ a year, and we need to reduce our impact to net zero by around 2050. Some estimates suggest this might mean removing around ten gigatonnes of CO₂ a year from 2050 onward. Some of these ideas for using CO₂, if implemented properly, could play a role in making that more economically viable. Some ideas for using CO₂ might not get off the drawing board. But with the right investment and incentives, others may move from niche research projects into credible plans, and from the work of small businesses to the goal of entire industries. Here is a selection of the ways that one person’s pollution could become another’s product. There are several ways in which buildings can be constructed with materials made from CO₂. The first is obvious: use wood. Growing and sustainably harvesting trees for building means that CO₂ is taken from the atmosphere, converted into a valuable commercial product, and stored as carbon in long-lived buildings.   It also reduces demand for cement, which is responsible for 10-15% of global greenhouse gas emissions through its production. New technologies, such as cross-laminated timber or acetylated wood, are making this substitution ever easier.   The second way is to use and then store CO₂ in concrete-making processes, by curing cement or in the manufacture of other ingredients like aggregate.   CO₂ can be used in polymers to make durable plastics for cars and buildings. Around 60% of plastics have applications in sectors other than packaging. Plastics made from CO₂ could displace plastic products made from fossil fuels for these sectors, particularly as they don’t require toxic or dirty ingredients such as phosgenes or epoxides, and can be cheaper to make than fossil-fuel based materials. Because the CO₂ molecule is a stable part of the backbone of the polymer, it can be stored in these materials for as long as they last. CO₂ can be used as a feedstock for many chemical processes, with hundreds of potential end products, including hydrocarbon fuels and urea fertilisers.   Fuels made from CO₂ can exist in the form of methanol as well as more complex products like so-called synfuels. These fuels can often be blended or moved around using existing infrastructure like pipes and tankers. And although CO₂ fuels are currently very costly to manufacture, in the future they might be valuable in niches like aviation or long-distance shipping, which are more difficult to decarbonise than trains and cars because they need fuels with higher energy densities. If the CO₂ product is a fuel or a fertiliser, the CO₂ ends up back in the atmosphere once used. While two uses of the carbon is better than one, if the carbon atom originally came from a fossil fuel, it’s not a long-term solution. To be climate neutral, the CO₂ feedstock will have to be sourced from the air – so the CO₂ is taken from the atmosphere, made into fuel, and then emitted back to the atmosphere. This is currently expensive and technically challenging. Crucially, the energy required for this process also needs to be renewable.   There’s emerging evidence that  increasing the amount of carbon in soils can also increase crop yields. This is a natural form of CO₂ utilisation that already happens – scientists and farmers can just give it a helping hand. One particularly promising way is by using biochar – plant material that has been converted into a stable form of organic carbon via a process known as pyrolysis. Biochar buried in soils could store carbon for the long term and increase crop yields.  The general benefits of replenishing and maintaining carbon in the soil are well established, but using soil as a store of carbon is challenging because it is easily disturbed.

      We need more carbon in our soil to help Australian farmers through the drought


 Counter-intuitively, it’s possible to both produce oil and store CO₂. That’s because injecting CO₂ into an oil well increases the amount of oil that can be recovered – so-called “CO₂ enhanced oil recovery”.  It is actually possible to operate the well so that more CO₂ is put into it than is emitted in the process of producing the oil and burning it. But policy changes would be needed to incentivise this – oil companies would not do it otherwise. And it’s a temporary fix. In a world that has fully decarbonised, demand for fossil oil should be close to zero. Nonetheless, this could be a short-term way to stimulate much needed demand for CO₂ capture, as emitters could sell their waste CO₂ to oil producers. All these options for using CO₂ have potential, but making them a reality will need a clear understanding of the possible unintended consequences. Many could be failures, so it’d be unwise to rely solely on any one of them, but instead, spread bets widely. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter. Climate change is inevitable.

We applaud the NHTSA for doing what most other federal agencies are not wont to do—that is, make a direct determination of the impact that this proposed regulation will have on the course of future climate change. As a result of your analysis, you conclude (pg. S-24):



The magnitude of the changes in climate effects that would be produced by the most stringent action alternative (Alternative 5) is roughly 1.2 ppm less CO2, a few thousandths of a degree difference in temperature increase, a small percentage change in the rate of precipitation increase, and about 1 millimeter (0.03 inch) of sea‐​level rise.



Further, you go on to explain (page 5–75, footnote 37) that:



[T]he projected reductions in global climate effects for each of the alternatives are too small to incorporate into a regional/​local‐​scale analysis, which would likely introduce uncertainties at the same magnitude or more than the projected change itself (i.e., the projected change would be within the noise of the model)

"A landmark BFI study has called for the film industry to step up attempts to address its environmental impact – including the possible mandatory reporting of carbon emissions. “It is clear that resource consumption and associated carbon emissions are underreported by productions, and in some cases not reported at all. The industry needs to take significant steps to change this,” concludes A Screen New Deal, the first wide-ranging survey since a 2006 UCLA study that has so far been virtually the sole yardstick for the sector’s ecological toll.  Blockbuster films with budgets of over $70m (£53.5m) produce an average of 2,840 tonnes of CO2 per production, the new report reveals – a figure equivalent to the amount absorbed by 3,700 acres of forest in one year. Devni Acharya, senior consultant on the circular economy at Arup, the company that conducted the research for A Screen New Deal, says that an accepted standard for measuring a production’s footprint is still lacking. “The first step is to creating a consensus for reporting [emissions], and the second step is perhaps to make it mandatory,” she says. “But there’s a few steps before we get to that point.” The study, produced in collaboration with the Bafta-led consortium behind carbon calculator Albert, gathered data from 19 tentpole productions in the US and the UK, related to two different production companies, and interviews with 50 people from across the industry. But this data was anonymised; even for Arup, not just in terms of what was published, demonstrating the continuing reluctance within the industry to be fully accountable for the ecological side. Accusations have followed from this that current sustainability practices amount to nothing more than greenwashing. Around 51% of emissions were related to transport, the report found, with 30% of that accounted for by air travel and 70% by land. The rest was due to energy consumption, with 34% of the average blockbuster’s CO2 emissions going on mains electricity and gas, and 15% on diesel generators. The report is restricted solely to film production – and does not account for later stages in a film’s life cycle, such as distribution. With the current exponential demand in streaming video – responsible for producing 300m tonnes of CO2 in 2018, approximately the same as the national output of Spain – there is growing concern around its ecological cost. Acharya says the report focuses on production in order to provide the best possible blueprint for change in this area – and is hopeful this will happen. “I feel very optimistic, especially at this point in time,” she says. “Nations and specific industries are all talking about a green recovery, and we have a really unique opportunity to create change in the industry from here onwards. I hope the report provides real direction for that.” Many of the report’s recommendations on digital production processes, such as use of collaboration platforms for planning schedules and even shooting scenes, have already seen increased uptake during lockdown and as global film production resumes. The Russian production company Bazelevs has been promoting its platform Screenlife, which allows directors to stage drama inside a panoply of text browsers and video chat windows. In the UK, footage horror Host, shot using remote methods, has been a critical success. As well as such digitised methods, the report gives recommendations and case studies for sustainable practices in four other areas of film production: production materials, energy and water, studio building and facilities, and studio sites and locations. This guide has been designed to allow film-makers to address their ecological impact in a more systematic way that has so far been attempted. Many film productions currently employ eco-consultants to ensure their set is run on ecological lines, through the likes of recycling production materials. But their effectiveness is often limited, as the report points out: “In reality, the people appointed to these roles often lack the agency to integrate with the decision-making power of production managers, who perceive their recommendations as an imposition.” “One way to empower eco-consultants is to get them involved in the pre-planning phases, where key decisions are made: the sets to be constructed, how supplies are procured, locations,” says Acharya. “Getting them involved from the beginning where they can change those decisions would be really great.” The report expands on a previous BFI study, Green Matters, but such panoramic overviews remain rare, partly because of the difficulty of auditing a secretive industry. The €2m European Green Screen initiative, which ends this year, offers advice on good practice, but has not attempted to comprehensively measure the footprint of film production on the continent. The 2006 UCLA study estimated that Hollywood produced 15m tonnes of CO2 annually – though the industry has grown considerably since then."

The French monarchy were somewhat known for their self-indulgence, it could be said. From Louis XIV’s dazzling palace at Versailles, to Marie Antoinette’s faux-“rustic” retreat Hameau de la Reine, the _Ancien Régime_ had a reputation for extravagant indifference and isolation from the crushing poverty of their subjects.



Compared to the _Nouveau Régime_ of the Hollywood elite, though, Marie Antoinette was as down-to-earth as a welfare mom in a Florida trailer park.



Every time a celebrity alights from their private jet to wag their fingers about greenhouse gas emissions, I’m left wondering, **“Do these arseholes actually hear themselves?”**



The celebrity arseholes don’t come any more arrogant, elitist and utterly deaf and blind to their own hypocrisy than **Jane Fonda**.



Actress and political activist Jane Fonda now says she is quitting plastic surgery as part of her efforts at “self-acceptance” amid her crusade to force the Trump Administration to acknowledge climate change as a threat of apocalyptic proportions.



Yep, I’m sure the first thing **Trump** thinks about every morning is, “I wonder what that wizened old commie hag would say?”



Is botox a greenhouse gas? How much methane does a septuagenarian crone emit while creaking through an aquarobics class? What’s the carbon footprint of a gold-plated Zimmer frame?



Fonda’s efforts have been hilariously self-obsessed. Although she convinced many of her famous friends to get arrested alongside her, none of them have spent time in jail, according to Vulture, even though Fonda claims she’s in danger of being “locked up” for “99 days or more.”



[…]In order to get arrested on Fridays, Fonda “relocated” to Washington, D.C., for four months, but she won’t reveal her accommodations — and they’re most certainly not one-star. The “iconic” red coat Fonda has worn during her protests — which she says is the last piece of clothing she will ever buy off the rack — is either a $750 Mai-R Wool Wrap Coat or, comically, a $2,950 Max Mara dyed camel hair number. Her new, “sustainable” haircut took seven hours. Her “ethically sourced” gold jewelry, which she wore to the Oscars to top off her “recycled” Oscars gown did little but spark mockery.



Fonda’s diamonds-and-gold activism must surely rank among the peak moments of celebrity narcissism-as-activism. “Let them wear Cartier!”, indeed.



Actress and left-wing activist Jane Fonda signaled her goodness this weekend via social media, posting a photo of herself in a recycled designer dress and her “ethically harvested” and “sustainable” jewelry.



Fonda, an abortion enthusiast and avid climate activist, presented “Best Picture” at the 2020 Oscars on Sunday.



“At Oscars wearing Pomellato jewelry because it only uses responsible, ethically harvested gold and sustainable diamonds. #Oscars,” the actress posted early Monday morning. […]Fonda’s designer dress was also reportedly “recycled,” meaning she wore it to an award show once before.



No doubt to her utter astonishment, the predominant reaction to Fonda’s elitist virtue-signalling was widespread mockery and derision.



“I’ve worn these same Target earrings six days in a row. I am basically Captain Planet,” said The Daily Wire’s **Emily Zanotti**.



Still, these morons are so tone-deaf to their own vainglorious stupidity that Fonda probably took that as an endorsement. “I’ve raised awareness among the peasants,” she probably croaked.



Of course, that assumes that Fonda even bothered asking one of her Mexican servants to take time out from peeling grapes and fetch the mistress’ white-gold-and-diamond-crusted GoldVish Le Million phone, in order to check her Twitter feed. Far more likely that she’s still ensconced in blissful ignorance in one of her many gated compounds, bathing in the blood of virgins, or whatever idiot routine Gwyneth Paltrow is advocating this week.

Under the bottom line: Climate models are a very long way from being reliable. They are still at the primitive stages.
==============================================
Impact of sea smell overestimated by present climate models
Most comprehensive study on the atmospheric oxidation of the natural climatic gas dimethyl sulfide published

Leipzig. The formation of sulfur dioxide from the oxidation of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and, thus, of cooling clouds over the oceans seems to be overvalued in current climate models. This concludes scientists from the Leibniz Institute for Tropospheric Research (TROPOS) from a model study on the effects of DMS on atmospheric chemistry. Until now, models considering only the oxidation in the gas phase describe merely the oxidation pathway and neglect important pathways in the aqueous phase of the atmosphere, writes the team in the journal PNAS. This publication contains until now the most comprehensive mechanistic study on the multiphase oxidation of this compound. The results have shown that in order to improve the understanding of the atmospheric chemistry and its climate effects over the oceans, a more detailed knowledge about the multiphase oxidation of DMS and its oxidation products is necessary. Furthermore, it is also needed to increase the accuracy of climate prediction.
Dimethyl sulfide (DMS) is formed by microorganisms and is, for example, also part of human breath odor. However, it is more pleasant to remember as the typical smell of the sea. DMS represents the most common natural sulfur compound emitted to the atmosphere. Major contributors are oceans, which make up around 70 % of Earth’s surface. DMS is formed by phytoplankton and then released from the seawater. In the atmosphere, DMS oxidizes to sulfuric acid (H2SO4) via dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and sulfur dioxide (SO2). Sulfuric acid can form new cloud nuclei, from which new cloud droplets can emerge. Hence, marine clouds will be visually brightened, which influences the radiative effect of clouds and thus Earth’s climate. Therefore, the understanding and quantification of these chemical processes in the atmosphere is of high importance for the knowledge of the natural climate effect.
The oxidation process of DMS has already been investigated in various model studies – albeit without accurate considered aqueous-phase chemistry. In order to close these mechanistic gaps, scientists of TROPOS have developed a comprehensive multiphase chemical mechanism (“Chemical Aqueous Phase Radical Mechanism DMS Module 1.0”). This mechanism was coupled to a comprehensive gas-phase (MCMv3.2) and aqueous-phase mechanism (CAPRAM) and applied with the SPACCIM model. The SPACCIM model was developed at TROPOS and is, due to the detailed and combined description of microphysical and chemical processes in aerosols and clouds, particularly suitable for complex studies on atmospheric multiphase processes.
As most important outcome, the new model results showed that: “The processes in the aqueous phase significantly reduce the amount of sulfur dioxide and increase the amount of methanesulfonic acid (MSA). In earlier models, there was a gap between the projected values in the model and measurements. Now, the scientists have been able to clarify this contradiction and thus confirm the importance of the aqueous phase for the atmospheric oxidation of dimethyl sulfide and its products such as MSA”, reports Dr. Andreas Tilgner of TROPOS.

The results show that the role of DMS in Earth’s climate is still not sufficiently understood – despite many global model studies. “Our simulations indicate that the increased DMS emissions lead to higher aerosol particle mass loads but not necessarily to a higher number of particles or cloud droplets. The modeling results are important to understand the climate processes between ocean and atmosphere. In addition, geoengineering ideas are constantly being discussed, which are hoping for more cooling clouds by fertilizing the ocean”, explains Prof. Hartmut Herrmann from TROPOS. However, this study suggests that the production of sulfur dioxide is less pronounced and the effects on the back-reflection effect of the clouds are lower than expected. Therefore, the corresponding geoengineering approaches could be less effective than assumed. Tilo Arnhold

The Leibniz Association connects 88 independent research institutions that range in focus from the natural, engineering and environmental sciences via economics, spatial and social sciences to the humanities. Leibniz institutes address issues of social, economic and ecological relevance. They conduct knowledge-driven and applied basic research, maintain scientific infrastructure and provide research-based services. The Leibniz Association identifies focus areas for knowledge transfer to policy-makers, academia, business and the public. Leibniz institutions collaborate intensively with universities – in the form of “Leibniz ScienceCampi” (thematic partnerships between university and non-university research institutes), for example – as well as with industry and other partners at home and abroad. They are subject to an independent evaluation procedure that is unparalleled in its transparency. Due to the  importance of the institutions for the country as a whole, they are funded jointly by the Federation and the Länder, employing some 18,500 individuals, including 9,300 researchers. The entire budget of all the institutes is approximately 1.7 billion EUR. http://www.leibniz-gemeinschaft.de/en/home/

There is understandably, considerable uncertainty amongst the majority of the general public about the veracity of the claims made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that anthropogenic (man induced) emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gasses, are the cause of the present warming period being experienced by planet Earth. There is no empirical evidence available to demonstrate or prove this relationship, despite the expenditure of some $50 billion directed to this end.

"**One of Hong Kong's most high-profile entrepreneurs, pro-democracy tycoon Jimmy Lai, has been charged with illegal assembly and intimidation.**
The illegal assembly charge relates to a banned anti-government march on 31 August, which Mr Lai is accused of attending.
The intimidation charge relates to a clash with a journalist in 2017.
The newspaper Mr Lai founded, Apple Daily, is frequently critical of Hong Kong and Chinese leadership.
Two other pro-democracy figures, politicians Lee Cheuk-yan and Yeung Sum, were also arrested on Friday.
They have also been charged with one count of illegal assembly in relation to the same protest.
Senior Superintendent Wong Tung-kwong said all three men would be called to the Eastern Magistrate Court on 5 May.
The coronavirus outbreak has paused the city's pro-democracy rallies - but anger against the government is still widespread.
Prior to the outbreak, the city had seen almost weekly protests, with activists having a series of demands - including more democracy and less control from Beijing.
According to an Apple Daily report, 71-year-old Mr Lai was arrested at his home and taken to a Kowloon police station.
Police spoke to him in 2018 about the journalist incident but the investigation did not continue.

The Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposed regulation Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Fuel Efficiency Standards for Medium‐ and Heavy‐​Duty Engines and Vehicles—Phase 2 results in no demonstrable or verifiable mitigation of future climate change—the primary justification for the regulation. The reported reductions in the rate of rise of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, average global temperature and global average sea level are so small as to be statistically indistinguishable from the evolution of these measures absent this regulation. As such, it is scientifically improper for the EPA to claim this regulation results in a “meaningful” impact on future climate change. Further, the EPA did not investigate any impact beyond the grossest of global‐​scale measures.

Many Americans believe President Bush pushed the price of gasoline down to help Republicans in the upcoming election. Congress believes it can ban Americans from gambling on the Internet. And the state of California believes it can change the temperature of the globe through government regulation. 



What all such beliefs have in common is technological provincialism — the naive notion that global commerce can easily be compelled to dance to the tune of national or local politicians. 



A recent Washington Post‐​ABC News poll found “3 out of 10 Americans think the recent fall in gasoline prices is a result of White House and Republican Party efforts to influence the November elections.” 



To believe this, one would have to accuse the International Energy Agency in Paris of being part of this partisan conspiracy, since the IEA has been slashing its estimates of worldwide oil demand. Because natural gas prices have also been falling, one would also have to believe Republicans control that world market — in which Russia is the biggest player. 



These are global markets — the whole world. Prices of crude oil, gasoline and natural gas did not fall in the United States alone and stay high everyplace else. To imagine the president or Congress could somehow push world prices down at will is to vastly underestimate the size and power of these markets. 



Another excellent example of technological provincialism is the “Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act,” which hopes to deter domestic banks and credit card companies from processing payments to and from Internet gamblers. That would apply only if some particular form of gambling is demonstrably illegal under state or federal law, which would be difficult in theory and impossible in practice. 



Imagine some prosecutor trying to prove Miss Jones was playing poker on a particular laptop at some specific time and place. A gambler can easily disguise his location by using a foreign proxy, which then appears as the IP address on the Web site’s server. The location of a gambling Web site can likewise be concealed or frequently moved. There are also numerous foreign and domestic financial intermediaries that can and do conceal the source and/​or recipient of fund transfers. It is called the “Worldwide” Web for a reason. 



Then there are California’s quixotic efforts to affect the world’s climate. Whatever you think about the causes, consequences or reality of global warming, it is the height of provincial arrogance to imagine the global climate could be perceptibly changed by a single state. 



California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger nonetheless signed the Global Warming Solutions Act, which states that “on or before Jan. 1, 2011, the Air Resources Board shall adopt greenhouse gas emission limits and measures to achieve the maximum feasible and cost‐​effective reductions in GHG emissions.” 



The press gullibly reported the bill’s rhetorical hopes and dreams for 2020, rather than the reality that what turns out to be “feasible and cost‐​effective” will not even be estimated for several years. 



Business Week noted, revealingly, that “the bill might have died on the floor without the energetic support of L. John Doerr, a partner at Silicon Valley venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.” It turns out, coincidentally, that this famed billionaire’s firm and its venture capital clients stand to benefit financially from this otherwise inexplicable legislation. 



In a truly amazing act of Spitzerian judicial caprice, California’s Attorney General Bill Lockyer is suing General Motors, Ford, Daimler‐​Chrysler, Toyota, Honda and Nissan for having the audacity to sell vehicles that emit carbon dioxide. He might as well sue California motorists for breathing, since that too emits carbon dioxide. 



Hollywood producer Stephen Bing also spent $40 million to push Proposition 87, which would sternly tax any companies still foolish enough to drill for oil in California. In addition to being a terrific gift to Iran and Venezuela, this scheme would also dole out political grants and subsidies for “alternative fuels” and “energy‐​efficient vehicles” (he happens to have invested in a company producing electric cars, which means they would usually run on coal). 



As to greenhouse gases, alternative fuels are usually more problem than solution. Fermentation to produce ethanol increases carbon dioxide emissions, and producing energy‐​intensive crops to convert into ethanol increases nitrous oxide emissions. The resulting fuel also makes vehicles 30 percent less energy‐​efficient.



Ethanol subsidies and California air regulations are openly hostile to energy‐​efficient vehicles. Unlike nearly all Americans, Californians will not even be allowed to buy the extremely clean new diesel cars and fuels — such as the fast and luxurious E‐​class diesel Mercedes, which gets 37 miles per gallon on the highway and 27 in the city. 



In locating the sources of global greenhouse gases, regardless of their overall source or impact, the total insignificance California’s cars and light trucks is quite simple to calculate. 



The International Energy Agency estimates the United States accounts for 21.8 percent of all carbon dioxide resulting from fuel combustion (rather than from evaporation of the ocean, forest fires, volcanoes, fermentation and breathing). Since California accounts for 13.3 percent of national gross domestic product, the state’s share of global carbon dioxide emissions is therefore 2.9 percent. 



According to the Environmental Protection Agency, transportation accounts for a third of carbon dioxide emissions, but personal vehicles account for just 60 percent of that — or 20 percent of the total (half as much as electric power plants). 



In other words, all the passenger cars and light trucks in California account for one‐​half of 1 percent of global carbon dioxide due to fuel combustion — a trivial matter in comparison to coal‐​fired power plants and factories in China. 



California’s pretentious posturing about changing the world’s climate through stern regulation for some and lavish grants for others provides a suspiciously preposterous example of technological provincialism. Perhaps the interests involved are not quite as cosmic and high‐​minded as some would like us to believe.

"**Up to 200 anti-government protesters remain barricaded inside a Hong Kong university, surrounded by police, as the standoff continues for a third day.**
Those who are still inside Polytechnic University (PolyU) are said to be running low on supplies.
Protesters have been inside the campus since last week, initially stopping police from entering by lighting fires and throwing petrol bombs.
Adults who leave face arrest, and some are too scared to come out.
Hundreds of protesters tried to run from the campus on Monday, but many were hit with tear gas and rubber bullets and arrested.
Police have revealed that on Monday alone, at the campus, they used:
A small group of protesters managed to leave using rope ladders before being picked up and driven away by motorcyclists.
Those arrested could be charged with rioting, which carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison.
On Sunday night, police warned protesters they had until 22:00 (14:00 GMT) to leave the campus.
Police later moved in, surrounding the campus, leading to protesters throwing petrol bombs and firing stones from catapults.
The violence at PolyU is one of the biggest flare-ups Hong Kong has seen since protests broke out in June.
Tuesday saw the UN human rights office urge the Hong Kong authorities to de-escalate the situation at PolyU and address the humanitarian situation of those inside which it said was ""clearly deteriorating"".
It added that some demonstrators' use of violence, including against the police, ""cannot be condoned"".
The mostly young protesters have five key demands, including an investigation into police brutality and universal suffrage.
But underpinning it all is the fear Hong Kong's unique identity is threatened by China.
Tensions now could be further inflamed after China condemned a decision by Hong Kong's high court to overturn a ban on facemasks.
An estimated 100 to 200 protesters still remain in PolyU, authorities have said.
One protester called Jeff told the BBC that he was hiding in a building on the campus.
""I have been trapped inside Polytechnic University for two days and food and water is running out,"" he said.
""Most people tried to get out of this hell-like place, most of them tried to escape but ended in failure, being arrested or wounded or something.""
""I didn't expect this incident to get so desperate in here. The campus is so desperate and I am not well prepared. I would call it a disaster.""
He said his parents were concerned for his safety and he had told them he would make it out.
One tourist from mainland China is too scared to leave. He told BBC News Chinese that he was curious about what was going on at the university and had arrived on Sunday at the invitation of a friend who studies there.
After a visit to the library and a meal, he learnt that police had cordoned off the whole area.
""I am not a rioter,"" the tourist, who wishes to stay anonymous said. ""I don't want to get caught and I just need to go back to China.""
A handful of protesters have been trickling out of the university, some suffering from hypothermia and leg injuries, according to news site SCMP.
One protester said he had decided to come out because of ""hunger and cold"", adding that many inside were ""hurt without enough medical supplies"".
Another 16-year-old protester told Reuters new agency she had chosen to ""surrender"".
""We have been trying to escape since yesterday morning. But then we couldn't find a way out [and] were afraid of being charged,"" she said. ""This is the only way... I was quite desperate.""
In the early hours of Tuesday morning, more than 200 students below the age of 18 left, accompanied by education officials including high school principals.
Those under the age of 18 had their identities recorded and were let go. Adults were arrested.
Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam called on all protesters to surrender, saying no violence would happen if they came ""out in a peaceful manner"".
However, she said police would have to take ""necessary action"" if that changed. Separately on Tuesday, Hong Kong's new police chief took office.
Chris Tang said the force was not able to end the protests alone, saying the unrest would only end if society condemned the violence.
A number of people have supported protesters behind the scenes, donating supplies to them or picking them up from protests and driving them home to avoid arrest.
**Pody Lui, BBC News Chinese, at PolyU**
We got into the university in the early hours of the morning. Police have cordoned off the area, making it almost impossible for new journalists to get in. Those trapped inside were desperate to get out.
The mood darkened as the day continued. More and more protesters gave up and left the campus willingly to face police arrest. They will be charged with rioting, meaning they could be jailed for up to a decade.
Those determined to stay were getting restless. They were not as friendly to journalists as before. They were scared and couldn't afford trusting a wrong person, fearing anyone could be an undercover police officer.
I overheard a Polytechnic University student talking to her father on the phone. ""I don't want to get caught. I will lose everything if I do,"" she cried. Her tired friend next to her said, ""I just want to go home.""
Hong Kong had previously banned protesters from wearing facemasks - but this was deemed ""unconstitutional"" by the city's high court on Monday.
China has condemned the high court's decision. It says it has the sole authority to rule on constitutional matters in the region.
Courts in Hong Kong have ruled on constitutional issues in the past. In 2017, the Court of Appeal found the Hong Kong government's decision to deny a partner visa to the wife of a female British expat was unconstitutional, despite the fact Hong Kong does not recognise same-sex marriage.
It is unclear what action, if any, China might take next.
This is a large part of what the ongoing protests in Hong Kong are about. Many in Hong Kong fear that its freedoms - including judicial independence - are slowly being eroded by Beijing.
Campuses had remained relatively free of violence during the Hong Kong protests - despite the movement being led mainly by students and young people.
But after the death of a 22-year-old student, that changed.
Last week, the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) became a battleground.
Police say protesters threw petrol bombs on a major road near the university in an effort to stop traffic. Officers attempted to reclaim the road, leading to major clashes.
Police revealed on Tuesday that some 3,900 petrol bombs were found at CUHK, adding that the university had 100 litres of sulphuric and nitric acids missing.
The university then cancelled all classes for the rest of the term. Days later, protesters at PolyU also tried to block access to a key tunnel near the university.
Protests have also been held at other locations in Hong Kong.
Hong Kong - a British colony until 1997 - is part of China under a model known as ""one country, two systems"".
Under this model, it has a high degree of autonomy and people have freedoms unseen in mainland China.
The protests started in June after the government planned to pass a bill that would allow suspects to be extradited to mainland China. Many feared this would undermine the city's freedoms and judicial independence.
The bill was eventually withdrawn, but the demonstrations continued, having evolved into a broader protest against alleged police brutality, and the way Hong Kong is administered by Beijing."
"If you live in the US or Australia, you’re likely to know about PFAS (or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances). But in the UK, few people have heard of them, despite one scientist I know describing the presence of these pollutants in UK groundwater as “a ticking timebomb”. Dark Waters, directed by Todd Haynes and starring Mark Ruffalo, has helped popularise the story of PFAS pollution in the US. It focuses on true events in the US town of Parkersburg, West Virginia, where a local factory began making Teflon in the 1950s. Despite the industry allegedly knowing the risks of these compounds, over 1.7 million pounds of PFOA – a particular type of PFAS – were emitted to the environment between 1951 and 2003. Research suggests that the safety threshold for PFOA in drinking water may be as low as 0.1 parts per trillion. That’s 700 times lower than the safe level that has been cited by the Environmental Protection Agency in the US. Since 1951, over 50,000 Parkersburg residents  have been affected by PFAO contamination in their drinking water.  It wasn’t an incompetent small-time outfit that was implicated in the scandal, but the multinational DuPont. The case rolled on through the 1990s and early 2000s, ultimately resulting in a class action lawsuit worth several hundred million dollars. But the toxic influence of PFAS stretches beyond Parkersburg and DuPont. Today, the whole planet is contaminated with them.  For much of my career, I’ve worked as an environmental forensic investigator, identifying sources of pollution and measuring the exposure to humans and wildlife. As scientists, we’re normally reserved in our choice of words, but PFAS could be described as one of the most dangerous groups of pollutants in the world today. PFAS are a group of synthetic organic chemicals that consist of multiple fluorine atoms attached to a carbon backbone. They are incredibly useful compounds with great waterproofing properties. They’re added to coats and coffee cups to stop liquids leaking in or out. They’re also used in food packaging to stop grease seeping through and frying pans to help make washing up easier. PFAS can also form effective foams which are used by firefighters to combat some of the most extreme fires, such as on oil rigs and in airports. So what’s the problem?  Well, for one, PFAS are highly toxic. They persist in the environment and accumulate in animal tissue so effectively that they’ve been nicknamed “forever chemicals”. PFAS exposure has been linked to several different diseases, including testicular and kidney cancer. They are also soluble in water, which means that they can travel much faster through the environment than other persistent organic pollutants such as PCBs and dioxins.

      The Conversation: special preview film screening of Dark Waters followed by exclusive environmental Q&A


 PFAS have been used for decades, and their levels in the environment are increasing. It’s only recently that we discovered that they are even present in remote Arctic regions, where there is no known local source. While research has helped establish contamination levels in the US and Australia, much less is known about the UK, where PFAS have been widely used for decades. They must be accumulating in the environment somewhere.  Understanding the scale of the issue is one thing, and was an important first step in adding the PFAS compounds PFOS and PFOA to the Stockholm Convention, an international treaty focused on eliminating persistent organic pollutants, in 2009 and 2019 respectively.  The manufacture of these two chemicals is now being phased out, but other PFAS compounds are being used in their places. These are still likely to be toxic and persistent and to accumulate in ecosystems. A recent study estimated that there are over 4,700 different PFAS compounds in the world today. Rather than having high concentrations of a small number of PFAS, there is a high total concentration of a wide number of PFAS. The problem hasn’t gone away, it has just got more complicated. In forensic investigations of pollution, scientists have to identify who is responsible. The case depicted in Dark Waters was pretty clear cut, but there are so many different potential sources of PFAS, as they have been used widely for decades in many different products. This can make identifying one source of PFAS from another difficult.  I research new techniques for measuring pollutants in the environment that can differentiate between sources. One technique, called chemical fingerprinting, can identify sources of pollution by comparing the chemical composition of a suspected source material to the chemical signature found at the pollution site. This is similar to traditional forensic fingerprinting, where police compare a suspect’s fingerprints to those found at a crime scene. These signatures can change over time as the chemicals are degraded and altered in the environment, but we have developed methods to cope with this. Scientists are often hired as expert witnesses and called to court to present evidence and explain who is responsible for a pollution incident. While we might get paid by a company we are defending, our duty is to provide a balanced assessment of the evidence to the court. This is the only way that those who have been affected by environmental pollution can obtain some kind of justice. Dark Waters might increase public awareness of PFAS in the UK and other countries when it launches on February 28, but could it drive research to uncover environmental contamination? Scientists have all the tools at their disposal to undertake this task. It is just a matter of funding and public support."

Share this...FacebookTwitterI keep hearing how the Arctic is warmer than normal, and so it’s a sure sign of “global warming”.
Yet I came across a chart earlier today showing conditions over Siberia, which of course is a vast region. What’s interesting is the extent and sheer depth of the cold that has gripped this area:

Chart clipped from: https://earth.nullschool.net/#current/wind/surface/level/overlay=temp/orthographic=204.17,41.87,446/loc=138.342,52.952
I roughly outlined the lower 48 states in the above chart (right) and compared it to the size of the dark rose area (-40°F and colder) over Siberia (left). Here we see that this area is at least enough to cover half of the lower US 48 states. When you go over the region with your mouse you find many areas under 60°F below. A couple of locations showed -70°F! Certainly no global warming there.
What does it tell us? Most likely if you combined both the Arctic and Siberia, you’d end up with a mean temperature that is about normal. Indeed the globe is currently just a couple of tenths of a degree C above normal. That’s it. That’s what all the fuss is all about. 95% hysteria.
Some people may not realize it, but the North Pole is in fact a rather small area, and so to claim that it being “really hot” this year is a sign of global warming is just fake science.
The unfortunate thing is that no one lives there, and so no one is able to enjoy the warmer than normal temperatures happening this winter.
What’s unfortunate is that people do live in Siberia, and right now these people aren’t happy about the extra-severe conditions, and would certainly welcome a bit of that “Arctic warming”.

Many are angry after the Supreme Court’s decision last week in _McCutcheon v. FEC_ , which struck down the limit on how much someone can contribute in total to all candidates combined. In the current political climate, few things seem to inflame the passions like the ominous specter of “money in politics.” There are also few areas where people are more misinformed. Here are three truths about campaign spending that may calm some nerves.



 **Campaign spending increases voter knowledge.**





Money in politics elicits ire, but rarely does that ire come with understanding.



This may seem counter‐​intuitive, but imagine a world where contribution limits to candidates were set at $50, or even $100. It would take a long time to amass enough money to run just a single ad telling voters your name and ideals. Challenging an incumbent under those conditions would be nearly impossible. This is one reason why incumbents tend to like campaign finance laws.



Moreover, many studies have shown that ads increase voter knowledge, interest, and even turnout. One study concluded that “exposure to campaign advertising can produce citizens who are more interested in a given election, have more to say about the candidates, are more familiar with who is running, and are ultimately more likely to vote.”



 **Money doesn’t buy elections**.



Money is important in elections, particularly when challenging an entrenched incumbent with name recognition and media presence. For a House candidate, the first $500,000 or so is absolutely crucial. After that, the returns diminish sharply, and each next dollar spent is worth less than the last.



However, dumping massive amounts of cash into an election certainly does not guarantee victory. Take former eBay CEO Meg Whitman, who spent $144 million of her own money only to lose the California gubernatorial race to Jerry Brown. Or conservative donor Sheldon Adelson, who spent $42 million in 2012 backing nine candidates with only one of them winning. Or the Koch brothers, who spent $33.5 million on ads attacking Obama, and we know how that turned out.



True, the higher‐​spending candidate usually wins the election, but did he/​she win _because_ of the money? That’s a more difficult question. Donors like to back winners, and they will often give to candidates just because they think they will win. This is especially true when low contribution limits make it difficult for a single donor to make a big difference in the outcome. Rather than giving a small amount to someone who will lose anyway, they give to the leading candidate. Candidates in safe districts, districts where the margin of victory all but ensures that one party will win, still get donations. According to election guru Nate Silver, the number of landside districts has doubled since 1992. There are now 242 of them. Candidates who oppose the entrenched party or incumbent receive very few donations and party support, thus essentially ensuring that, in those 242 districts, the “bigger spending” candidate will win. But it is the demographics and gerrymandering that cause those victories, not the spending.



 **Political opinions do not significantly correlate with wealth**.



Although it seems to be a common and fervently held belief, wealth and socioeconomic status do not effectively predict political beliefs. There are poor Democrats and rich Democrats, same as Republicans. For every Sheldon Adelson there’s a George Soros. For every Charles Koch there’s a Warren Buffett.



There is nothing inherent about having money that makes someone a Republican. However, over the past two election cycles, heavy spenders backing GOP candidates have garnered much of the hatred and headlines. But it is easy to imagine a world where pronounced Democratic dissatisfaction with a Republican president creates a fundraising bonanza for Democrats. In fact, we saw that when Obama broke fundraising records in 2008.



In one recent Gallup poll, the top 1% are 33% self‐​identified as Republicans and 26% self‐​identified as Democrats, a slight, but not a strong, tilt toward Republicans. If we include the leanings of independents, the Gallup poll found that 57% of the “nation’s wealthiest” associate themselves with the GOP. This slight lean towards self‐​identified Republicans, however, is difficult to disentangle from the fact that people in general are far more likely to self‐​associate as conservative rather than liberal. People apparently just don’t like to call themselves liberals. In terms of policy preferences, however, it’s long been known that there is little difference along the socioeconomic spectrum in support for policies that are arguably in the self‐​interest of either the poor or the rich.



There is no evidence that shows that freeing up campaign spending will inevitably create policies that prefer the wealthy. Many think this is naive because “obviously” our policies prefer the wealthy, despite the fact that 70% of federal spending goes to the poor and middle class and the richest 10% pay 53% of all federal income taxes. If the debate is just about what policies benefit the poor or rich, then we’re back to the same policy debates that have been going on for decades but couching them in discussions about money in politics.



Money in politics elicits ire, but rarely does that ire come with understanding. Blaming money in politics for perceived policy failures also provides a convenient explanation for why the world doesn’t align with your policy preferences. Thus, many people believe that stopping political spending and shutting up “outside influences” is the best way to create desired policy change. This motivation should be seen for what it is: censorship. The First Amendment exists to protect political speech of all types, including, and especially, “wrong” speech. You can disagree with what someone says but still defend to the death his right to say it, even if it is Sheldon Adelson.

"■ The    resort doubles its initiation fee  —   to $200, 000  —   leading to charges that the Trump Organization is cashing in on its founder’s power. ■ By President Trump’s definition of voter fraud, his senior adviser, Steve Bannon, his Treasury secretary nominee and one of his daughters could be swept up in the investigation. ■ The Twitter rebellion seems to be spreading as the Defense Department weighs in on Muslim refugees. The initiation fee at Mr. Trump’s    club in Florida  —   which the president himself has called the Winter White House  —   has doubled to $200, 000, after membership applications surged in the wake of Mr. Trump’s election, the head of membership there said. Bernd Lembcke, the managing director at the Palm Beach, Fla. club, said the change in the initiation fee had been planned last fall, before the election, and that $200, 000 had been the fee before 2010, when it was cut in half because of the recession. But Mr. Lembcke, who has been at the club for 21 years, said that it also reflected the upswing in   ’s popularity. “We have had a sudden surge in requests,” he said, adding that new members must be recommended by someone who is already a member, as is the case at many private clubs. Robert Weissman, president of Public Citizen, a nonprofit group that promotes government ethics, said the move showed that Mr. Trump and his family intended to profit from his status as president. “At the minimum, this creates the appearance of cashing in the presidency and selling direct personal access to the president,” he said. “It is unacceptable. And it demeans the office of the presidency. ” The new initiation fee went into effect on Jan. 1, although the annual dues remained the same  —   $14, 000 a year, he said. The club has 482 members, with a cap of 500. “It enhances it,” Mr. Lembcke said of Mr. Trump’s new job and its impact on the value of the membership. “His presidency does. ” “But we are very careful in vetting them,” he added. News about the change in the initiation fee was reported by CNBC. By President Trump’s definition, his senior White House adviser, Steve Bannon, is apparently committing voter fraud. So is his nominee to be the next Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin. So, apparently, is one of his daughters, Tiffany Trump. Mr. Trump was pretty broad with his definition of voter fraud when he took to Twitter Wednesday morning to request an investigation of the nefarious conduct of the 2016 electorate  —   with no evidence to support it. There is, in fact, a difference between investigating actual voter fraud and cleaning up the voter rolls. If you move states, you aren’t usually required to tell the state you are leaving that you no longer want to be on the roster. And so it goes that Mr. Bannon is registered in Sarasota County, Fla. and New York City. Mr. Mnuchin appears on the rolls of New York and California. And Tiffany Trump, should she choose, could potentially vote in Pennsylvania and New York. If she did, of course, that would be fraud. Now Melania Trump is fielding her own foreign leader calls. Sara Netanyahu, the wife of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, called Mrs. Trump on Wednesday to congratulate her on becoming the first lady, according to the prime minister’s office. “The two of them look forward to seeing each other soon in Washington and to working together to strengthen the ties between Israel and the United States,” Mr. Netanyahu’s office said. Their husbands spoke by telephone earlier in the week, and Mr. Trump invited Mr. Netanyahu to visit him in Washington next month. President Trump announced that he will nominate businessman and former military intelligence officer Philip Bilden as secretary of the Navy. Mr. Bilden, who ran a private equity firm in Hong Kong until retiring three years ago, has expertise in both maritime affairs and Asia  —   two areas that are of central importance to the Navy. He was picked over an early Trump campaign backer, former Rep. J. Randy Forbes of Virginia. Mr. Bilden received a Masters of Business Administration from Harvard in 1991. First came the reposting of photos by the National Park Service that clearly showed that President Trump’s inauguration crowd was smaller than former President Barack Obama’s in 2009. That was followed by a contrite apology and lots of pretty pictures. But the national parks took up the cause, with a Twitter storm on climate change from the Badlands that was quickly taken down. And lots more: Now, with word that Mr. Trump is moving to shut down the flow of refugees and halt immigration from   nations, is the Defense Department joining the fray? Incidentally, the National Park Service now says those Twitter posts from the Badlands came from a disgruntled former employee who had commandeered the account without permission. A National Park Service official said Tuesday: No official word on why so many other parks chimed in. Mr. Trump may have thought he was being constructive when he weighed in on Chicago’s terrible murder rate, but his offer (or threat) of federal support has not gone over well  —   either with Chicago Democrats or   Republicans. Rep. Luis V. Gutiérrez, Democrat of Illinois was miffed. But Republicans weren’t too keen on the notion of the federal government swooping into to fight city crime. The Republican media consultant Rick Wilson noted the obvious: Perhaps Mr. Trump’s motivation isn’t much of a mystery. On Monday, Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago offered the president what he called “unsolicited advice. ” “You didn’t get elected to debate the crowd size at your inaugural,” Mr. Emanuel said. “Now, obviously, I wasn’t a supporter of   Trump. He got elected to make sure that people have a job, the economy continues to grow, people have security as it relates to their kids’ education, etc. And it wasn’t about your crowd size. It was about their lives and their jobs. ” “The speech missed an opportunity to speak to our better angels as a country,” he said of the president’s inaugural address. Or maybe Mr. Trump was just watching Bill O’Reilly on Fox News. Who says former (and supposedly bitter) rivals can’t join forces in the spirit of Washington’s most unifying party  —   the “green” party? (That’s money, get it?) No emoluments clause apparently can stop the former Clinton and Trump campaign managers Robby Mook and Corey Lewandowski from hitting the road for paid gigs on the speaking circuit, which is precisely what the two will do together. Leading Authorities, a speakers’ bureau, said it is organizing the events as “ ” assessments of Donald Trump’s White House. The two will also “debate the day’s hot issues,” including cyber attacks. Mr. Lewandowski just recently set up shop down the street from the White House in a consulting and lobbying firm he runs with another former Trump adviser, Barry Bennett. Update: The speaking agency has now deleted the material from its website. A representative for the firm told Buzzfeed that the listing was generated by them and not Mr. Mook and Mr. Lewandowski. Another update: Mr. Mook says no way, he never would have agreed to this buddy show. His press aides won’t say what exactly is bothering Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, but something clearly has gotten his goat. It might be that the new administration has been slow to answer requests that date back to the Obama administration. Then again, his committee still hasn’t voted out the nomination of Mr. Trump’s nominee for attorney general, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama. With the Trump Organization under a very public microscope, the company said Tuesday that it has appointed two monitors  —   Bobby Burchfield and George Sorial  —   to keep tabs on any ethical issues that may arise. The former has strong ties to Republican politics and the latter to President Trump. Mr. Burchfield, a Washington lawyer who has represented George H. W. Bush and the Republican National Committee, was appointed as independent ethics adviser to the Trump Organization, meaning he will advise on avoiding conflicts of interest, with the power to sign off on certain transactions. A longtime Trump Organization executive, Mr. Sorial will now be chief compliance officer, giving him a lead role in ensuring that the company complies with ethics rules and standards, while also implementing new policies. The two will assume their roles at a time when Mr. Trump has said he is trying to remove himself from the activities of the business that carries his name. Mr. Trump said during a news conference on Jan. 11 that he would place his business in a trust controlled by his two adult sons  —   but some ethics experts have chided the plan for not going far enough to avoid conflicts."
"**Hong Kong police say they found almost 4,000 petrol bombs in two days while clearing the Polytechnic University campus.**
The campus was the site of a fiery stand-off between activists and police - and on Thursday, with the protesters having left, the officers moved in.
They found 3,989 petrol bombs; 1,339 explosive items; 601 bottles of corrosive liquids; and 573 weapons.
The campus has now been handed back to the university management.
Protesters barricaded themselves inside the campus two weeks ago.
The authorities responded by sealing off the university grounds, trapping more than 1,000 protesters inside at one point.
Activists - armed with bricks, petrol bombs, and even bows and arrows - attacked the police lines during the siege.
Over the past week, most protesters either surrendered or escaped. On Friday, police said:
**Linh Nguyen, BBC News Vietnamese**
Elvis, a 19-year-old student, spent five days inside PolyU during the siege.
""Chairs and tables were all taken out to create barricades so everyone was sleeping on the ground but it was comfortable because we were so tired,"" he told the the BBC.
""Many people were caught. We tried to escape three times but kept failing because the police kept firing teargas and rubber bullets at us. I don't think they wanted us to leave. It was a nightmare. There were blood everywhere.""
The protesters cooked for themselves with supplies provided by members of the press or medical team.
""Most of the water tasted like teargas. That's why we had to drink bottled waters. On the fourth day, there were no fresh water bottles left, so we drank water from bottles left behind.""
Some protesters were able to escape by climbing down ropes from a road bridge, but Elvis said it was too dangerous and he didn't want to leave others behind. He injured his leg in one attempt.
Some of his friends escaped through an underground tunnel but he said ""it smelled really bad.""
He was eventually taken out of university on a stretcher bed on day five, with his personal information marked down and his photo taken, before being transferred to a hospital.
Hong Kong's protests started in June against a proposed law to allow extradition to mainland China, but they have transformed into a larger pro-democracy movement.
Last Sunday, Hong Kong held local council elections that were seen as a barometer of public opinion towards the government and the protesters.
The elections saw a landslide victory for the pro-democracy movement, with 17 of the 18 councils now controlled by pro-democracy councillors.
This Friday saw another small demonstration in the centre of Hong Kong, with activists insisting on their list of five key demands.
The list includes full democracy for the territory and an inquiry into police behaviour.
A former British colony, Hong Kong is part of China, but enjoys ""special freedoms"" under the ""one country, two systems"" arrangement.
Those are set to expire in 2047, and many in Hong Kong are uncertain about their future."

"MOGADISHU, Somalia  —   When the first explosion rang out, the men on the hotel patio looked up for a moment, then at one another  —   and kept on eating breakfast. Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, long ago grew accustomed to such jarring sounds, and nobody seemed surprised by a loud bang somewhere not too far away. It took another, even louder explosion a few minutes later to get everyone’s attention. Something fatal was going on. A   of the militiamen who guard the hotel piled into a pickup with their Kalashnikovs and ammunition vests while the photographer Tyler Hicks and I grabbed our gear  —   cameras, notebooks, bulletproof vests, press credentials, bottles of water  —   and climbed into an armored truck, slamming the door tight behind us. We headed for the hospital. I have been to Mogadishu many times, but this was my first visit in several years, and when I got to town, I was struck by how much progress the capital seemed to be making. There was still plenty of evidence of the   city of old  —   the crushed houses, craters and   walls  —   but there were also new apartment complexes, crowded markets and freshly painted shops selling   TVs. It was even possible to go out for pizza Tuesday night, something I would never have dared before. The scene at the hospital tore at that hopeful illusion. The floor was slippery with blood. Dozens of wounded people streamed in, bleeding from their heads, faces, feet, arms and backs. Some were covered in fine white dust from collapsed walls. Some lay on steel gurneys as squadrons of flies crawled over their shrapnel wounds. Some were clearly in pain. There was confusion, anger, shouting and a lot of sweat. Talking to witnesses, I began to piece together what had happened. Terrorists had struck at another hotel across town from ours, the Dayah: first with a bomb, and then with gunmen spraying fire at hotel guests. The attack ended with a second bomb. By the grim standards of Mogadishu, where terrorist attacks have sometimes killed as many as 50 people in an instant, the toll on Wednesday was not especially large. Government officials said later in the day that about 13 people had been killed, and about 50 had been wounded. The BBC reported that nearly 30 people were dead. No one I spoke to at the hospital had any doubt who was responsible: It must have been the Shabab, they said, meaning the Somali militant organization that has been terrorizing the country for years. The group later claimed responsibility. In the corner of one ward, a young man was lying with a   video camera next to him. He spoke a little English and said he felt good enough to talk. His name was Mohamed Abdihakim, and he was a freelance journalist, making his living filming the mayhem that Mogadishu regularly endures. When he heard the rumble of the first explosion roll across the rooftops like thunder, he said, he jumped into a   (a kind of motorized rickshaw) and urged the driver to head for the rising column of smoke as fast as he could. Along the way, he said, a colleague warned him by phone that it was never a good idea to be the first one on the scene of an attack. But Mr. Abdihakim, 28 and determined, said he had to get there, and he did  —   in time for the second explosion. He was standing next to some other journalists and filming the scene when the blast knocked them all to the ground. Both his hands were badly injured. “Do I have any regrets? No,” he said from his hospital bed, wearing mittens of gauze. “But maybe it’s time to do something else. ” There seemed to be hundreds of people at the hospital, and the crowd thickened by the minute as battered cars raced up with more casualties. Armed men shoved past us, waving guns menacingly at anyone in the way. For more than 25 years since its old central government collapsed, Somalia, one of the world’s poorest nations, has lurched from one crisis to another: civil war, famine, piracy, Islamic militancy. But in the last few years, it seemed as though another war was being waged for Mogadishu’s soul  —   between residents trying to get on with life and taste a little normalcy and those bent on ruin. Peacekeepers from the African Union have managed to stabilize the main cities in recent years,   militias have calmed down a bit, some foreign investment has flowed in and life has improved. Many roads are newly paved. There are now working streetlights and dry cleaners and cash machines, small miracles in a country that had become a byword for anarchy. Somalia is in the process of selecting a new president, who will be chosen by members of Parliament in the next few weeks. Government officials say the Shabab have been trying to derail that process, and attacked the Dayah Hotel on Wednesday because some newly elected representatives were staying there. A similar explanation appeared on a website associated with the group. The first explosion, officials said, was from a large truck bomb at the hotel gates. Four gunmen stormed in afterward, and the final explosion, a bomb in a minivan, went off about 15 minutes later. Three of the assailants were quickly shot, and the fourth killed himself with a suicide vest, officials said. From photos of their bodies, all appeared to be young, possibly even teenagers. According to Somali authorities, no government officials were killed in the attack. The dead were hotel guards, guests and bystanders."
"WASHINGTON  —   President Trump intends to move forward with a major investigation of voter fraud that he says cost him the popular vote, White House officials said Wednesday, despite bipartisan condemnation of his allegations and the conclusion of Mr. Trump’s own lawyers that the election was “not tainted. ” In his first days in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump has renewed his complaint that millions of people voted illegally, depriving him of a   majority. In two Twitter posts early Wednesday morning, the president vowed to open an inquiry to reveal people who are registered to vote in multiple states or who remain on voting rolls long after they have died. “We have to understand where the problem exists, how deep it goes, and then suggest some remedies to it,” said Sean Spicer, the president’s press secretary. He said the White House would reveal more details this week. But voting officials in both parties across the country said the answer to those questions is already clear: Fraudulent voting happens in tiny, sporadic episodes that have no impact on the outcome of elections. It is virtually impossible, several state election officials said, that millions of people voted illegally in last year’s presidential contest. In fact, that was the conclusion of Mr. Trump’s own lawyers last year as they sought to stop recount efforts in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. “All available evidence suggests that the 2016 general election was not tainted by fraud or mistake,” Mr. Trump’s lawyers wrote in their response to recount petitions by Jill Stein, the Green Party presidential candidate. Mr. Spicer said the lawyers were referring only to states where Mr. Trump campaigned extensively. In Ohio, Secretary of State Jon A. Husted, a Republican, said Wednesday in an interview that there was “no evidence” that voter fraud was happening on a large scale. Edgardo Cortés, Virginia’s election chief, a Democrat, said there was “no basis” for the claims. And California’s Democratic secretary of state lashed out at the president for undermining confidence in the election system. “Free and fair elections are the bedrock of our democracy, and he’s taken a jackhammer to it with his irresponsible tweets,” said Alex Padilla, the state’s top election official. “Whatever proof or evidence he said he had, he clearly didn’t have. His allegations since November are clearly lies, not alternative facts. ” Mr. Trump has repeatedly shifted his view of the election system. As a candidate, he frequently railed against what he called a “rigged” election. When he became   he complained about “serious voter fraud,” but later reversed himself and mocked Ms. Stein’s recount efforts as “a scam” and a waste of time and money. This week, he   again, telling lawmakers at a White House reception that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote because millions of immigrants in the country illegally voted for her. Mr. Spicer declined to elaborate on what Mr. Trump meant but did not back away from the assertion. “The president does believe that,” Mr. Spicer said. “It’s a belief that he’s maintained for a while, a concern that he has about voter fraud. And that’s based on information that’s provided. ” It remains unclear what form a federal investigation may take. While the F. B. I. has the authority to look into voter fraud, that appears not to be what the president has in mind. Mr. Spicer said it was too early to know, but mentioned the possibility of a task force or commission. He cited studies that he said showed that voter rolls contained the names of millions of people who should not be there because they had moved, were not citizens or had since died. But the author of one of those major studies said Wednesday that Mr. Spicer and the president appeared to be misunderstanding the numbers. David Becker, who for six years was in charge of the election initiative for the Pew Center on the States, said that voter rolls often had    information, but that there was virtually no evidence that many of those names were used to vote illegally. “It does exist, but it happens in very, very small numbers and nothing like what is claimed by the president,” Mr. Becker said. He said systems across the country to prevent voter fraud would have caught any huge effort to vote illegally. “We would have seen that well before the election,” he said. “We would have seen a swelling of the voter rolls and records. ” In Ohio, for example, a review of the state’s elections in 2012 and 2014 found that out of millions of votes cast, there were 667 allegations of fraud, of which just 149 were referred to law enforcement for investigation, Mr. Husted said. The Ohio review, which happens after every election, also found that 436 unauthorized immigrants were registered to vote and that 44 had voted. “Voter fraud exists. It’s not widespread or systemic,” said Mr. Husted, who said he had voted for Mr. Trump. “There’s no evidence that that is happening on a   basis. ” Mr. Husted said he would be happy to share Ohio’s review of the 2016 election with the federal government when it was completed. And he said Mr. Trump could aid states by sharing government databases that could help them clean their voter rolls. In his Twitter message Wednesday, Mr. Trump suggested that a federal review could lead to improvements in voting procedures. But Democrats and voting experts criticized the president for focusing his allegations on voter fraud while resisting the intelligence community’s conclusions involving Russian hacking of the Democratic National Commitee and officials connected to Mrs. Clinton during last year’s election. “It’s more important that we investigate the known instances of election fraud, rather than imagined ones,” said Kim Alexander, the president of the California Voter Foundation, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization dedicated to improving the voting process. “We have had an election that was compromised by foreign interests. That’s the real danger that has come out of this election. ” Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said the president should “knock this off” and move on. “This is going to erode his ability to govern this country if he does not stop it,” he said on CNN. And several Democratic lawmakers and state election officials said they suspected that Mr. Trump’s allegations were part of a plan by Republicans looking for reasons to justify new restrictions on voting to benefit their party, particularly targeting immigrants and  . “There has been a sustained effort across the country, rooted in similar conspiracies about voter fraud, to make it harder for Americans to vote,” Senator Dianne Feinstein of California said in a statement. “We can’t allow this attack on voting rights to continue, and it’s shameful to see such debunked conspiracy theories emanating from the White House. ” Mr. Padilla, the California secretary of state, said he also worried that Mr. Trump’s repeated allegations about fraud would undermine the confidence that Americans had in the integrity of the voting system. “Stoking fear and concern is undermining people’s faith in our elections,” he said."
"**Two companies with major operations in Hong Kong have revealed the financial impact of violent protests in the City.**
Luxury fashion house Burberry said Hong Kong sales had fallen sharply and would ""remain under pressure"".
Airline Cathay Pacific said the civil unrest had ""been exceptionally challenging, severely impacting demand and operations of the business"".
The anti-government protests have gripped Hong Kong for five months and rattled stock markets.
Burberry said it had seen a ""double digit"" percentage decline in sales in Hong Kong - where it has 10 shops and usually generates about 8% of its sales.
However, its share of sales from Hong Kong fell to 5% in the latest quarter and chief financial officer Julie Brown said the group had been forced to close some stores to keep staff safe, although none had been damaged.
The retailer said it had written down the value of its stores in Hong Kong by Â£14m.
Despite this, total sales across the Burberry group rose 5% in the six months to 28 September. Marco Gobbetti, Burberry's chief executive, said the results were in line with the guidance earlier in the year despite the disruption in Hong Kong, and the retailer's shares climbed 5% in response.
Mr Gobbetti has been taking Burberry further upmarket since he took the helm two years ago and said the new collection from its chief creative officer Riccardo Tisci was generating ""strong double digit growth"".
Cathay Pacific - which is majority-owned by the Swire investment company, while Air China has a 30% stake - said the short-term outlook remained ""challenging and uncertain"".
The Hong Kong flag carrier lowered its profit guidance for the second time in less than a month.
The ""forward bookings outlook remains weak and uncertain"", the airline said, with passenger traffic dipping ""significantly"", particularly for inbound flights from mainland China.
The airline changed its top management in August when its then chief executive, Rupert Hogg, quit after the airline became embroiled in a controversy over the Hong Kong protests.
Cathay Pacific had initially told its staff it would not stop them joining the pro-democracy demonstrations, but days later Mr Hogg warned staff they could be fired if they ""support or participate in illegal protests"".
In Thursday's results presentation, the airline said inbound passenger traffic was down 38% in August and September, and 35% in October. It added it was reducing its fight capacity by 6% to 7% in the coming months.
The carrier is also deferring the delivery of four Airbus SE narrow body planes in 2020 as a result of the downturn in demand.
Luya You, an analyst at broking group Bocom International who attended Cathay's analyst briefing, told Reuters that the management ""didn't rule out more extreme measures - grounding aircraft, severing leases, cancelling orders - if the situation in Hong Kong deteriorates or extends significantly beyond expectations"".
All schools were closed on Thursday in Hong Kong as the territory faced another day of escalating unrest.
The protests started in June against plans to allow extradition to the mainland - which many feared would erode the city's freedoms.
Hong Kong is part of China, but as a former British colony it has some autonomy and people have more rights.
While the extradition plans were withdrawn in September, the demonstrations have continued, with protesters calling for an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality, and democratic reform."

This is all the more reason why Germans nationwide have been horrified by the mass deforestation taking place to make way for industrial wind parks.

The latest (shocking) example comes from south Germany, just north of Heidelberg, where the deforestation of the Wald Michelbach (along with the destruction of the homes of strictly protected species and biotope) is taking place.
German SWF public televisions recently reported on a protest mounted by concerned and shocked citizens who could not believe that the untouched forest was being chopped down.

Since Germany opted to shut down its nuclear power capacity in the wake of the Fukushima disaster in Japan, southern Germany has been looking for other sources of energy — and wind industry lobbyists seized the opportunity and have been pushing hard for wind power ever since.
Unfortunately the few ideal locations where wind power has any chance to perform are forested hilltops that make up the region’s idyllic landscape. Most feasibility studies show that the wind even at these locations is still not in great enough supply to make it worthwhile. Yet, that isn’t stopping the powerful wind industry from getting its way. Approvals in protected areas have been muscled and cajoled, against the will of the people and the common good.
The SWF report shows local protesters mobilizing soon after having heard that deforestation machinery had started clearing trees and destroying the habitat of many “strictly” protected species like the red kite hawk, owls and bats.
One upset protester commented:
The senselessness is incomprehensible. […] That you can rescue the climate by destroying the forest – I cannot understand it.”

The police were called in to remove the protesters.
Guido Carl of German of BUND (Friends of the Earth Germany), a leading environmental protection organization in the country (one that has long been accused of caving in to the wind industry) however thinks that the destruction of the forest is the right thing to do and that it “simply has to be accepted” in order to protect the climate.
Another protester points out that it is a fact the amount of wind in that part of the country is not enough and that it cannot make any real contribution to the Energiewende. He then adds that “you hardly can get by the mafia, you could say, the brainwashing that’s been put out to the people. As soon as you say you’re against wind turbines, you get labelled sick, which is complete nonsense.”
Ironically, in earlier times, most of the protesters had bought into the green energy promises. Today they stand shocked to see the destruction that it’s in fact wreaking. Unfortunately the project is only the very beginning of what the politicians and wind industry hope to achieve.
Here’s a shot of the forested hills where 5 industrial turbines are to be installed, despite the “strictly protected birds” inhabiting the area:

Image cropped from SWF.
The SWF reports that it is “incomprehensible” how a building permit could have been awarded. But everyone knows why: There’s big industrial wind money in the game paying off any bureaucratic obstacles and annoyances in the way — and all with the help of the BUND Friends of the Earth Germany, of course. BUND’s Guido Carl:
You have to expect that people at first will be upset about it, which is their personal right. How they cope over the long term is another issue. Studies show as a rule that people who live in the vicinity of wind turbines find a way of getting along with them over time.”
In this particular case, judging by the people’s outrage, I wouldn’t bet on it.

By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(German text translated by P Gosselin)
Coral horror stories have long been among the favorites of the media. Lately, however, a number of journalists have been taking a closer look at the state of the coral reefs. A good example is an article appearing in the German Spektrum der Wissenschaft (Spectrum of Science) on October 24, 2016, where Kerstin Viering did not allow research results to be swept away under the carpet:
Why some coral reefs are defying all the problems
Climate change, pollution, over-fishing: Coral reefs do not have it easy today. Some reefs, however, have been holding up amazingly well. A reason for optimism?”
Continue reading at Spektrum der Wissenschaft.
Currently research is making good progress. Slowly scientists are beginning to understand how corals are able to adapt to changed conditions. A press release from the University of Texas at Austin from November 7, 2016:

New Coral Research Exposes Genomic Underpinnings of Adaptation
Scientists at The University of Texas at Austin have observed for the first time that separate populations of the same species — in this case, coral — can diverge in their capacity to regulate genes when adapting to their local environment. The research, published today in Nature Ecology and Evolution, reveals a new way for populations to adapt that may help predict how they will fare under climate change.
The new research was based on populations of mustard hill coral, Porites astreoides, living around the Lower Florida Keys. Corals from close to shore are adapted to a more variable environment because there is greater fluctuation in temperature and water quality: imagine them as the more cosmopolitan coral, adapted to handling occasional stressful events that the offshore coral are spared. When researchers swapped corals from a close-to-shore area with a population of the same species from offshore waters, they found that the inshore-reef corals made bigger changes in their gene activity than the corals collected from an offshore reef. This enabled the inshore corals to adapt better to their new environment.
“It is exciting that populations so close together — these reefs are less than 5 miles apart — can be so different,” says corresponding author Carly Kenkel, currently affiliated with the Australian Institute of Marine Science. “We’ve discovered another way that corals can enhance their temperature tolerance, which may be important in determining their response to climate change.”
Differences in gene regulation — the body’s ability to make specific genes more or less active — can be inherited and are pivotal for adapting to environmental change. It was already known that separate populations often develop differences in average levels of gene activity, but now scientists have found that populations can also diverge in their ability to switch genes on and off.
“We show that one population has adapted to its more variable environment by developing an enhanced ability to regulate gene activity,” says Mikhail Matz, co-author of the study and an associate professor in the Department of Integrative Biology.
Researchers swapped 15 genetically distinct coral colonies from inshore with 15 colonies found offshore to see whether the corals would regulate their genes to match the pattern observed in the local population. After a year, the transplanted populations did show differences: Formerly inshore corals transplanted offshore changed their gene activity dramatically to closely resemble the locals, whereas offshore corals transplanted inshore were able to go only halfway toward the local gene activity levels. In short, corals that originated from the more variable, close to shore environment were more flexible in their gene regulation.
The lack of flexibility took its toll on the offshore corals, which did not fare well at the inshore reef and experienced stress-induced bleaching. Their higher bleaching levels were linked to the diminished ability to dynamically regulate activity of stress-related genes, confirming that flexibility of gene regulation was an important component of adaptation to the inshore environment.
“We saw different capacity for gene expression plasticity between coral populations because we looked at the behavior of all genes taken together instead of focusing on individual genes,” says Kenkel. “If we hadn’t, we would have missed the reef for the coral, so to speak.”
The research was funded by the National Science Foundation’s Division of Environmental Biology.
Ten days later the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute issued a hopeful press release showing that some coral reefs are tougher than long believed:
Corals Survived Caribbean Climate Change
Half of all coral species in the Caribbean went extinct between 1 and 2 million years ago, probably due to drastic environmental changes. Which ones survived? Scientists working at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) think one group of survivors, corals in the genus Orbicella, will continue to adapt to future climate changes because of their high genetic diversity.
“Having a lot of genetic variants is like buying a lot of lottery tickets,” said Carlos Prada, lead author of the study and Earl S. Tupper Post-doctoral Fellow at STRI. “We discovered that even small numbers of individuals in three different species of the reef-building coral genus Orbicella have quite a bit of genetic variation, and therefore, are likely to adapt to big changes in their environment.”
“The implications of these findings go beyond basic science,” said Monica Medina, research associate at STRI and the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History and associate professor at Pennsylvania State University. “We can look forward to using similar approaches to predict demographic models to better manage the climate change-threatened Orbicella reefs of today.”
To look back in time, the team of researchers working at the Smithsonian’s Bocas del Toro Research Station and Naos Molecular and Marine Laboratories collected fossils from ancient coral reefs and used high-resolution geologic dating methods to determine their ages. They compared the numbers of fossilized coral species at different time points. One of the best-represented groups in the fossil collections were species in the genus Orbicella. In addition to the fossil collections, they also used whole genome sequencing to estimate current and past numbers of several Orbicella species.
Within a single individual there are two copies of their genetic material, and in some instances, one copy is different than the other and is called a genetic variant. The authors first assembled the full genomic sequence of an individual from Florida and then, using it as an anchor, reconstructed the genetic variation contained within single individuals. Depending on the amount of the genetic variation at certain intervals across the genome, the authors were able to recover the population sizes of each species at different times in the past.
Between 3.5 to 2.5 million years ago, numbers of all coral species increased in the Caribbean. But from 2 to 1.5 million years ago, a time when glaciers moved down to cover much of the northern hemisphere and sea surface temperatures plunged, the number of coral species in the Caribbean also took a nosedive. Sea levels fell, eliminating much of the original shallow, near-shore habitat.
“Apart from the species that exist today, all species of Orbicella that survived until 2 million years ago suddenly went extinct,” write the authors. When huge numbers of species die out, it makes room for other species to move in and for new species to develop to occupy the space the others held.
Two species that grow best in shallow water doubled in number at about the same time that their sister species and competitor, the organ pipe Orbicella (O. nancyi) disappeared.

When a species declines during an extinction event, it loses more and more genetic variation and sometimes does not have much to work with during the recovery period. Scientists call this a genetic bottleneck. Orbicella was able to recover after the bottleneck.
“It’s incredible how predictions from genetic data correlated so well with observations from the fossil and environmental record,” said Michael DeGiorgio, assistant professor of biology at Pennsylvania State University.
“We see hope in our results that Orbicella species survived a dramatic environmental variation event,” said Prada. “It is likely that surviving such difficult times made these coral populations more robust and able to persist under future climatic change.”
“The in-depth analysis of population size in a now ESA-threatened coral, as well as the release of its genome and that of its close relatives (which are also threatened) would be of great interest to coral reef researchers addressing conservation issues,” said Nancy Knowlton, senior scientist emeritus at STRI, currently at the National Museum of Natural History.

Already in June 2015 Sascha Karberg wrote an impressively balanced article in German weekly Die Zeit:
Corals remain cool
Water that is too warm lead to the bleaching of corals. However special genes could help protect the reef forming animals. They also appear to do fine with acidification.
Corals do not need to wait for the chance gene mutation that would make them fit for the climate warming – the needed gene variants are already at hand. Biologists have discovered this when the crossed corals from warm and old climate zones. In order to prevent the corals from dying off, it would simply be enough to switch corals from different latitudes so that the existing gene variants could spread,”, says Mikhail Matz of the University of Texas in Austin.

What follows is the press release from the University of Texas at Austin dated June 25, 2015:
Corals Are Already Adapting to Global Warming, Scientists Say
Some coral populations already have genetic variants necessary to tolerate warm ocean waters, and humans can help to spread these genes, a team of scientists from The University of Texas at Austin, the Australian Institute of Marine Science and Oregon State University has found.
The discovery has implications for many reefs now threatened by global warming and shows for the first time that mixing and matching corals from different latitudes may boost reef survival. The findings are published this week in the journal Science.
The researchers crossed corals from naturally warmer areas of the Great Barrier Reef in Australia with corals from a cooler latitude nearly 300 miles to the south. The scientists found that coral larvae with parents from the north, where waters were about 2 degrees Celsius warmer, were up to 10 times as likely to survive heat stress, compared with those with parents from the south. Using genomic tools, the researchers identified the biological processes responsible for heat tolerance and demonstrated that heat tolerance could evolve rapidly based on existing genetic variation.
“Our research found that corals do not have to wait for new mutations to appear. Averting coral extinction may start with something as simple as an exchange of coral immigrants to spread already existing genetic variants,” said Mikhail Matz, an associate professor of integrative biology at The University of Texas at Austin. “Coral larvae can move across oceans naturally, but humans could also contribute, relocating adult corals to jump-start the process.”
Worldwide, coral reefs have been badly damaged by rising sea surface temperatures. Bleaching — a process that can cause widespread coral death due to loss of the symbiotic algae that corals depend on for food — has been linked to warming waters. Some corals, however, have higher tolerance for elevated temperatures, though until now no one understood why some adapted differently than others.
“This discovery adds to our understanding of the potential for coral to cope with hotter oceans,” said Line Bay, an evolutionary ecologist with the Australian Institute of Marine Science in Townsville.
Reef-building corals from species in the northern Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea are similar to those used in the study. There, too, reefs may benefit from conservation and restoration efforts that protect the most heat-tolerant corals and prioritize them for any restoration initiatives involving artificial propagation.
“This is occasion for hope and optimism about coral reefs and the marine life that thrive there,” Matz said.
In addition to Matz and Bay, the study’s authors were Groves Dixon, Sarah Davies and Galina Aglyamova at UT Austin and Eli Meyer of Oregon State University.

IPCC TAR (2001):
“The global average surface temperature has increased over the 20th century by about 0.6°C.”
This Met Office graph of global temperatures for 1860-2000 was included in the IPCC’s 2001 report.  It provided visual clarification of the 0.6°C temperature increase since 1900.

In taking a closer look, the graph does indeed show a warming of 0.6°C between 1900 and 2000:

At the time, this warming amplitude for the 20th century was widely accepted in the scientific literature.  For example:
Khilyuk and Chilingar, 2006
“Humans may be responsible for less than 0.01°C (of approximately 0.56°C (1°F) total average atmospheric heating during the last century).”
Vincent et al., 2005
“The global average surface temperature has increased by about 0.6°C over the twentieth century.”
Polyakov et al., 2003
“An analysis of observational records shows that the global surface air temperature (SAT) has increased by 0.6°C since 1861.”
The IPCC Adds 0.3°C Of Phantom Warming To Global Temperatures Between 2001 and 2013 Reports
The IPCC authors acknowledged that there was a pause in global warming since the 21st century began in the 2013 report (AR5), regularly referring to the pause as a “hiatus.”  They even acknowledged that 97% of climate model simulations (111 of 114) got it wrong, or didn’t simulate the lack of warming:
IPCC AR5 Chapter 9 (2013):
“For the period 1998–2012, 111 of the 114 climate-model simulations show a surface-warming trend larger than the observations.”
“Almost all CMIP5 historical simulations do not reproduce the observed recent warming hiatus.”
Even the UK’s Met Office — where the IPCC obtains temperature data (HadCRUT) —  acknowledged there was a pause in global warming since the early 2000s in a paper published in July, 2013, entitled “The Recent Pause in Global Warming.”
Met Office (2013):
“The start of the current pause is difficult to determine precisely. Although 1998 is often quoted as the start of the current pause, this was an exceptionally warm year because of the largest El Niño in the instrumental record. This was followed by a strong La Niña event and a fall in global surface temperature of around 0.2oC (Figure 1), equivalent in magnitude to the average decadal warming trend in recent decades. It is only really since 2000 that the rise in global surface temperatures has paused.”
Nonetheless, by the time the 5th report (AR5) was released later that year (2013), the IPCC (and the Met Office) had decided that a substantial warming of 0.25°C had occurred since the release of the 2001 report.   Twelve years and a hiatus later, the 0.6°C of warming since the 19th century ended had been transformed into 0.85°C of warming.
IPCC AR5 (2013):
“The globally averaged combined land and ocean surface temperature data as calculated by a linear trend show a warming of 0.85°C over the period 1880 to 2012.“
Apparently, 0.6°C since 1900 wasn’t substantial enough.  So 0.25°C of additional warming was tacked on.  After all, 0.85°C sounds a lot more dangerous than 0.6°C.
But notice there was a difference in starting points here: 1880 vs. 1900.  Was it possible that 1880 was -0.25°C cooler than 1900, which would account for the discrepancy?  Not according to the IPCC’s own 1860-2000 graph from the 2001 report.  Both 1880 and 1900 temperature anomalies were identical, as seen here:

So was it possible the additional 0.25°C of warming occurred since the 21st century began, or since 2001?  Not according to the HadCRUT temperature dataset.  Version HadCRUT3 was in use through 2012, and according to the data made available for public use on WoodForTrees.org (green trend line), HadCRUT3 indicated there was a cooling of about -0.05°C between 2001 and 2012.  The advent of HadCRUT4 in late 2012 allowed the Met Office to make substantial “up-justments” to the recent data, especially for the 2005 – 2012 period.  This extra warming added to the data could potentially eliminate the pause, or better conform temperatures to climate model expectations.  But even those “up-justments” didn’t work.  There was still no warming trend for the 2001-2012 period (purple trend line) even with the “up-justed” temperatures for HadCRUT4 from HadCRUT3.
WoodForTrees plot:

 
So with the elimination of the -0.05°C cooling between 2001 and 2012 as indicated by the HadCRUT3 data, and with the addition of 0.25°C of extra warming since 1880 or 1900 that didn’t exist in the 2001 report, the IPCC and the Met Office were able to subtly add  0.3°C to global temperatures between their 3rd and 5th reports.
But perhaps a more recent graph (2015) might shed light on where this extra 0.3°C of warming could possibly be coming from.   It doesn’t.

                                                                 Adapted Met Office graph available here.

Other than more-of-the-same suppression of the 1880s to 1940s warming period (notice the 1940-’45 warming amplitude has recently been reduced by -0.05°C, making 1980 warmer), the warming trend for the 20th century (1900-2000) is still 0.6°C as shown on this 2015 Met Office graph.  And between 1880 and 2012, the graph still shows 0.6°C of warming (actually, about 0.55°C, since 1880 has recently been heated up almost 0.1°C relative to 1900 for some reason).   Neither starting point (1880 or 1900) indicates a warming amplitude of 0.85°C as claimed by the IPCC in 2013.
Met Office Has Removed 0.3°C Of Global Warming Amplitude From 1880s-1940s Period, And Transformed Strong 1940s-’70s Cooling Into A Pause
As just mentioned, the most recent depictions of the global warming trend for the 20th century have 1980 about 0.05°C warmer than 1940-’45.  A few decades ago, or before a series of chronic “adjustments” to the data were made to artificially reduce the 1940s warming height, 1980 was still about  -0.15°C cooler than 1940-’45, a net change of 0.2°C.
For example, this 1981 global temperature graph from NASA shows 1940 still 0.15°C warmer than 1980.  James Hansen, lead author of the paper, even admitted that he thought it was “remarkable” that 1980 is almost as warm as 1940 was.
Hansen et al., 1981
“A remarkable conclusion from Fig. 3 [below] is that the global mean temperature is almost as high today [1980] as it was in 1940.”

Reducing the 1920s to 1940s warming amplitude has apparently been a high priority agenda item for overseers of temperature datasets for quite some time.  In exposed e-mail exchanges from 2009, for example, Phil Jones and Tom Wigley — both overseers of the HadCRUT datasets spanning decades and activists for the anthropogenic global warming cause  — discuss reducing the “1940 blip” in their reconstructions of 20th century temperatures by simply cooling the 1940 temperature data down by -0.15°C.

“If you look at the attached plot you will see that the land also shows the 1940s blip (as I’m sure you know). So, if we could reduce the ocean blip by, say, 0.15 degC, then this would be significant for the global mean — but we’d still have to explain the land blip. I’ve chosen 0.15 here deliberately. This still leaves an ocean blip, and i think one needs to have some form of ocean blip to explain the land blip (via either some common forcing, or ocean forcing land, or vice versa, or all of these). When you look at other blips, the land blips are 1.5 to 2 times (roughly) the ocean blips — higher sensitivity plus thermal inertia effects. My 0.15 adjustment leaves things consistent with this, so you can see where I am coming from. Removing ENSO does not affect this. It would be good to remove at least part of the 1940s blip, but we are still left with “why the blip”.
                                 — Tom Wigley, Phil Jones exchange, from uncovered Climate Research Unit e-mails

Not only has reducing the amplitude of the 1920s to 1940s warming been a priority among dataset procurers for the sake of advancing the cause, so too has eliminating the 1940s to 1970s global cooling period from the temperature record.   As shown in the Met Office graphs above, the 1940 to 1970 global cooling period extensively referenced in the scientific literature has now been reduced to a mere fraction of what it was reported to be during the 1970s.
–
The warming amplitude for the 1880 to 1940 period has now been reduced to between 0.2° and 0.3°C in modern datasets (see the smoothed blue trend line from 2015 Met Office graph above).  The cooling period between 1940 and 1970 has now been reduced to less than 0.1°C.

During the 1970s, it was commonly accepted by climatologists that the Earth had warmed by about +0.6°C between 1880 and 1940, and then cooled by -0.3°C between 1940 and 1970 (before temperatures began rising again in the late 1970s).  The Southern Hemisphere experienced only modest warming and cooling, but in the Northern Hemisphere, the warming and cooling was especially pronounced: 1°C of warming from 1880 to 1940, and -0.5°C cooling from 1940 to 1970.  Below are some examples of the widely accepted global and Northern Hemisphere temperature trends mentioned in the scientific literature during the 1970s.
–
Cimorelli and House, 1974
“[B]etween 1880 and 1940 a net warming of about 0.6°C occurred, and from 1940 to the present our globe experienced a net cooling of 0.3°C.”
Benton, 1970
“In the period from 1880 to 1940, the mean temperature of the earth increased about 0.6°C; from 1940 to 1970, it decreased by 0.3-0.4°C.”
Schneider, 1974
Introduction: “In the last century it is possible to document an increase of about 0.6°C in the mean global temperature between 1880 and 1940 and a subsequent fall of temperature by about 0.3°C since 1940.  In the polar regions north of 70° latitude the decrease in temperature in the past decade alone has been about 1°C.”
 

Robock, 1978
“Instrumental surface temperature records have been compiled for large portions of the globe for about the past 100 years (Mitchell, 1961; Budyko, 1969). They show that the Northern Hemisphere annual mean temperature has risen about 1°C from 1880 to about 1940 and has fallen about 0.5 °C since then”
Stockton and Boggess, 1979
“[A]verage temperature data for the northern hemisphere shows the range of change between 1880 to 1940 to be approximately 1.1°C.”
Douglas, 1975
“Since 1940, however, the temperature of the Northern Hemisphere has been steadily falling: Having risen about 1.1 degrees C. between 1885 and 1940, according to one estimation, the temperature has already fallen back some 0.6 degrees, and shows no signs of reversal.”
The net effect of substantially removing the warming from the 1880 to 1940 period (and concomitantly adding warming to the 1940s to 1970s cooling period) is to make the warming trend for the 20th and 21st centuries appear linear rather than oscillatory.  A linear warming fits climate models better, as the CO2 emissions rates have been linearly rising, of course, especially after about 1950.  Making the temperature record conform to modeling of CO2-induced climate changes is the main agenda.
Observations Found In Scientific Papers Reveal A 20th Century Temperature Oscillation, Not Linear Warming
If we were to return the 0.3°C of warming observed during the 1880s to 1940s period removed by the Met Office over decades of “adjustments” to the data, the graph of surface temperature changes might look like this:

Interestingly, when scientists reconstruct surface and ocean temperatures for the 20th century using physical evidence (such as ice cores), the steepness of the warming and cooling trends for the pre-1970s era looks eerily similar to the oscillatory trends depicted above.  In other words, modern scientists who have been recently eliminating the warming amplitude of the 1880s to 1940s period to conform to CO2-centered climate modeling would appear to be making the datasets less accurate than they were in the 1970s … and all for the sake of an agenda.
Below are several examples of an oscillatory rather than linear temperature record for the 20th century (i.e., pronounced cooling after the 1940s and a decelerated warming since the 1970s) found in the peer-reviewed scientific literature.

"Only 1.2% of the greenhouse gas emissions released by Australia’s top 65 emitting companies had to be offset under federal and state laws last financial year, an analysis has found. The analysis by Footprint, a sustainability news site, examined both regulatory constraints imposed on businesses with emissions greater than 1m tonnes and any voluntary offsetting commitments they made.  Combined, the 65 businesses emitted 352.7m tonnes – about two-thirds of Australia’s total greenhouse output. The analysis examined operational emissions only, and did not consider “scope 3” emissions that result from the products the businesses sell. Energy giant AGL was the biggest emitter, releasing more than 40m tonnes. The smallest on the list was the corporate group that owns rail freight business Pacific National, which emitted slightly more than 1m tonnes. The federal government’s safeguard mechanism policy was promised to limit emissions from major industrial facilities, in part by requiring them to offset carbon dioxide above a baseline. States and territories can also require companies to offset emissions through environmental approvals and licences. However, the analysis shows that both levels of governments have opted not to exercise these legislative powers. No state or territory government has imposed a carbon offset condition for more than a decade and there are only two state-imposed legacy offset conditions in place. Both were enforced by the Western Australian government – one on Chevron’s Gorgon liquefied natural gas project, the other on Woodside’s Pluto LNG development. Between them they require less than 4.5m tonnes of greenhouse gas to be offset. That equates to about 1.2% of total emissions from the 65 businesses that had to be offset. At the federal level, the safeguard mechanism is explicitly designed to constrain only “rogue emitters”, so the 65 do not have to offset in the overwhelming majority of cases. Five businesses had to surrender a total of 27,357 carbon credits last financial year to stay below their emissions limit, or baseline. It covered less than .0008% of the emissions released by the 65 entities. Nearly a third of the companies examined – 22 – had set voluntary targets that they would reduce their emissions in line with the headline temperature goals of the Paris agreement or expressed some kind of aspiration to reach net-zero emission. This group included several large corporate players: AGL, Origin Energy, Anglo American, BHP, Qantas, Fortescue and Telstra. Another 17 were found to have voluntary targets that were outdated, not based on what climate scientists say is necessary, including a net-zero aspiration. These included EnergyAustralia, Chevron, Alcoa, Santos, ConocoPhillips, Exxon, South32, Adelaide Brighton, Orica, Incitec Pivot, Boral and Newcrest. Two of these, Energy Australia and South32, say they intend to set goals that align with the Paris agreement. The remaining 25 had no emissions reduction target. They include Delta Electricity, LNG company Inpex, Peabody, Whitehaven, APA Group, Viva Energy, Coles Group and the owner of the Loy Yang B coal-fired power station. Coles says it plans to change this and set a target. The analysis also found that 25 of the businesses had not committed to adopting the globally recognised recommendations on climate-related financial disclosure, which set out what businesses should reveal to investors and shareholders about their exposure to climate risk. Those who had not committed to the disclosure standards include Alcoa, Delta, Peabody, Yancoal, Pratt Holdings, CITIC Pacific and several government-owned energy businesses, including Queensland’s Stanwell and CS Energy."

And a bunch of volcanoes could erupt, and a Carrington type solar flare event could happen, and an asteroid could hit the Earth. I worry about these far more than Antarctica.
From Penn State climate modeling via Eurekalert:
An ice sheet model that includes previously underappreciated processes indicates that sea level may rise almost 50 feet by 2500 due to Antarctic ice sheet melting if greenhouse gas emissions continue unabated, according to researchers from Penn State and University of Massachusetts, Amherst.
“In this case the atmospheric warming will soon become the dominant driver of ice loss, but prolonged ocean warming will delay the recovery for thousands of years,” the researchers report in today’s (Mar. 31) issue of Nature.
Antarctica was the primary contributor to sea level rise in the past and may be the primary contributor in the future because much of its ice sits on ground. Floating ice, like that of the Arctic Ocean, is already in the water and if it melts, does not raise sea level. The Antarctic contribution will also probably dominate melt from the smaller Greenland Ice Sheet. While only parts of Antarctica will melt in the worst case scenario, the melting suggested by the model would be sufficient to double the recent estimates by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for future sea-level rise over the next 100 years.
“Recently we looked at the long-standing problem posed by geological evidence that suggests sea level rose dramatically in the past, possibly up to 10 to 20 meters around 3 million years ago in the Pliocene,” said David Pollard, senior scientist in Earth and Environmental Systems Institute, Penn State. “Existing models couldn’t simulate enough ice sheet melting to explain that.”
Ocean warming has previously been identified as the main cause of ice retreat occurring today. Warmer water quickly erodes the underside of floating ice sheet portions. Floating ice shelves act as buttresses for the grounded ice inland, whose base is below sea level. Once the shelves are gone, the grounded ice can move faster. However, in previous models, this process did not simulate enough melting to explain the past sea levels, with only West Antarctica collapsing even though similar areas in East Antarctica with huge amounts of ice could collapse in the same manner.
Pollard, working with Robert M. DeConto, professor of geosciences, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, looked at two further mechanisms that could account for greater melting. The first mechanism is fracturing and deepening of crevasses on the low-lying floating ice shelves by pooling of surface meltwater and rainfall caused by warming air temperatures. If emissions continue unabated, this process will begin to dominate ocean warming within 100 years. It already caused the disintegration of the Larsen B Ice Shelf in 2002.
The second mechanism comes into play once floating ice sheets disintegrate back to the grounding zone, leaving extremely high walls of ice. These walls are so high that simple physics says they cannot structurally support their weight, and then collapse into the sea, eroding the cliff further and further inland as long as the bedrock stays deep enough below sea level. Similar cliffs, with about 328 feet of ice above sea level and 2625 feet below, exist today at a few of the largest outlet glaciers in Greenland and the Antarctic Peninsula, where huge calving events occur regularly.
Both of these mechanisms are known, but neither has been applied to this type of ice-sheet model before. The researchers incorporated the physics and tested the model, driven by high-resolution climate models and past climate data. The updated model reproduced ice-sheet retreat consistent with geologic sea-level data for the warm Pliocene and also for the last interglacial period around 125,000 years ago. Then they applied the model to the future, forcing it with various greenhouse-gas emission scenarios.
“Although the future sea-level contribution in our model is greater than previously thought, it is based on credible mechanisms and is consistent with geologic evidence of past sea-level rise,” said Pollard. “We regard the results as worst-case envelopes of possible future behavior, and the mechanisms should be considered seriously in future work.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf President-elect Donald Trump is looking for places to cut costs, he might want to take a look at the National Weather Service’s seasonal forecasting unit.
Yesterday at the Daily Update over at Weatherbell Analytics, veteran meteorologist Joe Bastardi looked at the season forecasts, generated by billion dollar super-computers,  recently put out by NCEP. Turns out they were totally wrong. You have to pity the poor persons who placed their bets on them.
The first example is the forecast for North America made by NCEP in November for December:

Here we see a warm December was forecast for North America. And you’d think with those billion-dollar super computers and all the years of experience the NWS has accumulated over the past 100+ years, they’d be able to land a general forecast (going out only a few weeks) somewhere in the ballpark, right?
Amazingly, they missed the ball park by light years. In fact the very opposite has taken place, at least where people live:

You have many industries and institutions who rely on these forecasts in order to get a rough idea of what to expect and thus plan accordingly. Today they have got to be wondering about what has happened. Joe wonders if the NWS models are capable of predicting any cold weather at all. There seems to be an obsession with warmth.
Maybe cold no longer exists in the warming fantasy world of government weather forecasting –who knows.
Joe points out that he same busted result happened for the November 2014 forecast made in October 2014.
Coldest in 50 years
The NWS end-of-year forecast for Asia was even worse. Here’s what the NWS projected for the final 3 months of 2016:

Clearly they forecast a rather mild late year for the entire Asian continent.

Now here is what has happened so far:

It was completely wrong!
According to Joe, instead of being on the mild side, huge parts of Asia have seen to coldest Oct-Dec period in 50 years! He comments:
I’ve never seen anything like this, as bad as this in computer modeling.”
We would expect that the Russians are not too impressed with the NWS, and are for sure using their own methods, by now.
So what’s wrong?
Joe seems to think that the NWS is relying too much on “computer model mathematics” and nowhere near enough on using analogues. Joe’s theory is that if you had very similar weather patterns in the past, then you can use them to help predict today’s weather patterns. I’ve been following Joe for a number of years, and it seems to work quite well for Weatherbell. Of course he’s gotten some wrong, but more often he’s been almost dead on.
Slipshod models?
Bastardi concludes that his method of using analogue years “has beaten the pants off the big high-powered mathematical models. And we didn’t need billions of dollars to develop this, either“.
Forget models predicting 40 years out
Joe comments on the model’s failing to see the cold:
Here’s what I want to ask you: If you can’t see this, how the heck is it supposed to know down the road 20, 30, 40 years if cooling is going to take place? It goes with what is going on now.”
Enjoy the weather. It’s the only (correctly forecast) weather we got!”

When and why developed nations became rich are central questions in economics and history.



The process was undoubtedly complex, involving many factors such as government policies, investments in infrastructure, terms of trade, legacies of colonialism, natural resources, climate, and luck. Differential economic progress around the globe over the past half century has stimulated a search for fundamental conditions that trigger and sustain the process of development and modernization.



Many researchers now recognize the importance of institutions that protect property rights for economic development: economic agents are less willing to invest if others can seize the returns of their investments. Research on the institutional roots of economic development often pays homage to the work of Douglass North and collaborators, who were trying to understand the onset and geographic spread of industrialization within Europe. They linked England’s head start, for example, to the Glorious Revolution of 1688, which limited the confiscatory power of the Crown and strengthened rights in private property. In their view, the commitment to property rights lowered interest rates on public and private investments that became the building blocks of industrialization. While the pathway is plausible, the historical data available to confirm the linkage to British industrialization is modest.



Our research contributes to this literature by clarifying the pathways between property‐​defining institutions and growth, and by incorporating work on a neglected continent, Asia. We divide property rights into two categories: institutions that define property rights, such as a land survey system and a land registration system; and those that protect property rights, such as land expropriation laws or constitutional safeguards against property takings. We assess the economic legacy of institutional change imposed by Japan on its Asian colonies, which were acquired through an opportunistic process of territorial expansion. We argue that decisions to colonize were exogenous to late 20th‐​century growth, a point substantiated by results from a quasi experiment in Micronesia. Prior to colonization these countries had complex systems of land tenure that impeded transactions, including multiple ownership, clan or lineage ownership, poorly defined boundaries, and lack of official titles. In an effort to generate tax revenue, Japanese colonial administrators abolished these complex systems in favor of single ownership, official titles, updated land registers, and boundaries established by clear survey maps. A new system made plain who was responsible to pay taxes.



Our inquiry is inspired by rates of economic growth that were vastly different across Asia, where Japan was the only Asian country to successfully begin industrialization in the late 19th century. Asian tigers (South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore) successfully industrialized in the second half of the 20th century, while other countries in the region are currently underway or have yet to begin. The ratio of per capita GDP between the most developed country and the least developed country in Asia is over 25:1. We ask to what extent might contrasting systems of property rights account for differential growth?



The case of Palau — an island country in Micronesia — provides a quasi‐​experimental setting, which shows that secure private‐​property‐​defining institutions provided a foundation for economic development. Japan controlled Micronesia from 1914 to 1945, and in Palau surveyed and registered private ownership from 1939 to 1941, classifying land into four categories: public, clan, lineage, and individual. In 1941 Japan began to survey other Micronesian countries, but the process was interrupted by World War II. After the war the United States controlled Micronesia, and in Palau, American judges upheld land titles originating from the Japanese land registers. The American judges consistently concluded that clans or lineages did not have any authority over private land. In other Micronesian countries, the American judges lacked legal proof of private ownership and, following the tradition of common law, upheld customary ownership rights that allowed a village or clan leaders to confiscate or deny land‐​use rights if a resident neglected customary obligations to the village. As a result foreigners only invested in private lands that were protected in an absolute way, as in Palau. In 2007 Palau was three times richer than other Micronesian countries.



The Asian experience suggests that the Japanese land survey was initially motivated by public finance. Land has two special characteristics that distinguish it from other assets: it is “immovable” and “everlasting.” Generally it is easier for the government to tax land as opposed to other assets that can be readily hidden. Effective land taxation, however, requires registers and maps to identify parcels, as well as a system linking taxpayers to the registers. In many countries, land taxes are evaded because the government cannot link registers, maps, and taxpayers. The Japanese land survey and registration system secured land taxation and thus promoted public finance.



The solution of a public finance problem eventually was important for private finance. The characteristics of land make it attractive to banks as collateral for loans. Our analysis shows, however, that banks accept land as collateral only if secure title and well‐​defined boundaries are part of a central‐ ownership verification system. The Japanese land registration system was designed to preempt ownership and boundary disputes and was well integrated into the ownership updating system and the citizen identity system. Thus, it promoted private capital markets. Because land was the most abundant and important asset in these agricultural economies, its collateralization provided a major boost for economic development. Especially when farmers obtained access to credit, they invested in irrigation systems that increased agricultural productivity.



A review of the history of land reforms shows that establishing a good land tenure system was more difficult than one might expect. First, reforms had to contend with rough boundaries used in the past. Landowners tended to exaggerate the size of their land parcels in private land transactions, thus most plots carried a history of boundary disputes. Second, the core of secure land transactions and collateralization is a centralized ownership verification system, which required not only land registration, but also a citizen identity system and an ownership updating system. Most governments, however, did not fully understand the importance of these components. Finally, land reforms usually change the whole structure of a society, and thus governments potentially face huge costs from socioeconomic and political destabilization.



In order to understand the conditions under which governments undertake effective land reforms that can promote long‐​run growth, we construct a simple model. The analytical model based on the stylized facts of land reforms shows that a short‐​sighted government surveys only a portion of land and does not create a citizen identity system or an ownership updating system. In sharp contrast, a far‐​sighted government adopts all the major components of well‐​defined property rights. 



The model shows that the main difference between the short‐​sighted reform and the far‐​sighted reform is future tax revenue. The real tax revenue from the short‐​sighted approach decreases over time because state land registers gradually become obsolete. Conversely, the real tax revenue from a far‐​sighted approach is stable because the updated land registers and the citizen identity system maintain current information for tax collection. The model also shows that stable tax revenue enables the government to reduce tax rates, to be less arbitrary, and to engage in long‐​range planning. Moreover, the creation of the updating system and the citizen identity system provides the institutional foundation for land collateralization.



Finally, the paper estimates the impact of institutions on economic growth. Japan acquired its colonies though wars from the 1890s to the early 1940s, including Taiwan and South Korea. Japan lost all of these colonies after World War II, and its land survey was interrupted in some places by the war. We argue that whether Japan conducted and completed a formal land survey is a key determinant of property defining institutions (i. e., land tenure system). Our estimates show that property‐​defining institutions stimulated financial markets that contributed to economic development. Our results are confirmed when using a similar approach with British Colonies in Asia.

Chris Trotter has given The Media Party [a swift kick in the gentleman’s vegetables](https://bowalleyroad.blogspot.com/2020/02/changing-climate-one-rnz-broadcast-at.html?fbclid=IwAR2wPZLeA9_HTm38wK3U6cxy-3fl2zfhWugs0jgD1ES3rgr3bgNNjaYSbq0) over their shock and horror that [some pensioners earn over $100,000](https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/money/119839432/nz-super-costs-up-as-nz-retirees-on-100k-passes-30000). It was [a sentiment that ‘Pinko’ Farrar echoed](https://www.kiwiblog.co.nz/2020/02/this_is_why_nz_super_should_be_means_tested.html) to show just how red both he and _Radio NZ_ are.



Recently, however, a couple of sentences from “The sound and the fury”, the _Listener_ editorial team’s assessment of the RNZ Concert debacle (22 February 2020) struck me as unusually perceptive.   
“To retain its taxpayer-guaranteed revenue, **RNZ must also retain its most precious commodity: public respect and support. That can be imperilled by poorly thought out judgements, including assuming that it should set the political climate.”**



 _Radio NZ_ has been deeply red for years but they have embroiled themselves deeply into political arguments and rather than reporting on issues they have instead decided to campaign and advocate on those same issues, picking sides and angles to push.



That climate-setting quip should have prompted a double-take from RNZ’s bosses. Its clear intention was to alert them (gently) to the fact that some of its key producers’ and editors’ more recent judgements have raised a few important eyebrows – and not in a good way. **There is a growing feeling among those whose education was vouchsafed to them in the years before our universities became customer-driven businesses, that RNZ has taken up an ideological position at some distance beyond either its listeners’, or the general public’s, comfort zones.**



Their promotion of Maori language and their attacks on NZ First are to the forefront of people’s minds.



A telling example of RNZ’s determination to set the political climate was broadcast on the public broadcaster’s _Checkpoint_ programme of Wednesday, 26 February 2020, in which RNZ reporter, Nita Blake-Persen, secured prime placement for her story “NZ Super costs up as NZ retirees on $100k passes 30,000”. 



**It is difficult to assign any other motive for producing this sort of story than a desire to fan the flames of intergenerational warfare.** Singling out high income-earners over 65 (whose annual contribution to the IRD, based on a minimum salary of $100,000 is a bracing $23,920!) was certainly inflammatory. Ms Blake-Persen’s analysis also hints strongly that the abandonment of the universalist principles underpinning NZ Superannuation may have to be accepted as unavoidable collateral damage in the aforesaid war between the generations.



 **More disconcerting, is what appears to be a lack of sensible editorial oversight of Ms Blake-Persen’s story.** Having read her copy, did _Checkpoint_ ’s editors, Pip Keane and Catherine Walbridge, not warn Ms Blake-Persen to calculate the total tax contribution of the 31,048 New Zealand superannuitants earning more than $100,000, and then compare that figure to the $608 million paid out to them by way of NZ Superannuation? A pretty sensible precaution, I would have thought, given that **if the 31,048 older Kiwis so provocatively singled-out by Ms Blake-Persen proved to be net contributors to the state’s coffers, then her whole story falls flat on its face.**



Which Trotter proceeds to demonstrate, and easily which is something a statistics wonk like David Farrar should have done too.



Which is exactly what we discover when we subtract NZ Super payments totalling $608,000,000 from Income Tax payments of $717,600,000 (31,048 x $23,920). **Far from being greedy Boomer leeches bleeding their hapless GenX offspring dry, these workers are contributing a net $134,668,160 annually to the public purse!**



 **All of which raises some disconcerting questions about RNZ’s overall ideological agenda, and on whose behalf it is being run?** Did Ms Blake-Persen’s highly tendentious story make it on to the airwaves simply because nobody thought to check it? Or, **is it evidence of a broader RNZ agenda to shame and blame the older generation for having the temerity to be born a couple of decades before its younger reporters and presenters?** It would be tempting to dismiss this suggestion as Boomer paranoia had the RNZ Board and its CEO not demonstrated so unequivocally their readiness to sacrifice older listeners for a “younger demographic” in relation to RNZ Concert. 



Ouch.



In the meantime **we can only sit back and admire Ms Blake-Persen’s propaganda skills.** Imagine the outrage among that “younger demographic” when they discover that a body of overpaid Boomers, equal in number to the entire city of Blenheim, is living high on the hog while they sweat away in the salt mines of Neoliberalism! Imagine their fear and loathing when presented with such doom-laden factoids as: “Last year, NZ Super cost $14.5 billion and that cost is increasing by more than $1b each year. By 2024 it’s predicted to cost the country nearly $20b a year.” (A figure, BTW, that places us well below the current pension costs of many European states when measured as a percentage of GDP.) Or that – _Quelle horreur!_ – “Inland Revenue figures showed 2500 people were getting Super payments while on incomes of more than $300,000”. 



Just imagine it! $300K a year! 



Once again, however, there is no mention of the Income Tax paid annually on that sum to the IRD: a trifling $89,920! Which is more than four times the $21,380 paid annually to an individual New Zealander aged 65+ and living alone. 



That’s because The Media Party is campaigning without the pesky need to trouble themselves with actually getting elected.



Sadly, the masses (and I include David Farrar in that group) just pounce on the shock and outrage that some pensioners dare to earn more than $100,000 per annum. 



Sometime soon we are going to see a real political actor come out and agitate to remove entitlements that have been [in place since 1977](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_in_New_Zealand#Superannuation). The last time someone tried to do that it was 1985 and the Labour party [implemented a controversial surcharge](http://docs.business.auckland.ac.nz/Doc/Where_angels_fear_to_tread.pdf) of 25 per cent on a superanuant’s other income over an exempt amount. There was an outcry and it turned into a festering sore that saw Labour lose the 1990 election in a landslide to Jim Bolger’s National Party. Unfortunately, despite pledging to revoke the surcharge, National instead kept it in place, **breaking their election promise.**



The anger and outrage led indirectly to two major events, the creation of NZ First and the removal of First Past the Post in favour of MMP. Eventually, in 1993 there was a cross-party accord on superannuation and then subsequently as part of the 1996 coalition agreement with NZ First, a compulsory savings scheme was proposed and ultimately defeated in a referendum. Sadly we missed the boat back then and Labour subsequently introduced what has effectively become a compulsory savings scheme, called Kiwisaver, in addition to National Superannuation.



Now, it appears from the agitation of The Media Party that we are being softened up again for more superannuation turmoil. The Media Party should create a manifesto and actually campaign on their agitprop. Then we will see how popular their ideas really are.

Guest essay by Eric Worrall
Warren Buffett doesn’t understand the insurance industry; Or so suggests the Huffington Post, in a rather hysterical critique of Buffett’s lukewarm acceptance of climate dogma.
Buffett’s case against the resolution boils down to this: “Thinking only as a shareholder of a major insurer, climate change should not be on your list of worries.”
First, he said, his company can handle any possible losses thanks to rising premiums. Because insurance policies are typically written for one year and repriced annually, Buffett’s company can hike premiums to better account for the heightened risk of climate change-driven losses.
Second, Buffett asserts that climate change has produced neither “more frequent nor more costly hurricanes nor other weather-related events covered by insurance.”
But eight of the 10 costliest hurricanes in U.S. history, in terms of insured losses, have occurred since 2000, according to the Insurance Information Institute. Nine of the 10 costliest floods in U.S. history, when measured by payouts from the federal government’s National Flood Insurance Program, also have occurred since 2000, according to the insurance group.
…
He [Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England] also warned about potential losses from claims on policies written by insurers. For example, insurance companies could be forced to make massive payouts if victims of climate change successfully hold accountable companies that contributed to it. He likened the situation to the one faced by U.S. insurers stung by tens of billions of dollars in losses from asbestos claims.
In fact, Carney said that as a result of recent weather trends, some now estimate that insurers are undervaluing their potential losses by as much as 50 percent.
Insurance companies caught unprepared for the effects of climate change could cause problems for government officials and put taxpayers at risk.

Huffington Post is upset, because Buffett claimed that insurance losses have not increased to date due to climate change. It does not matter to the Huffington Post, that Buffett thinks climate change is a serious issue. It doesn’t matter that Buffett is a world renowned expert at correctly pricing insurance risk, and has repeatedly demonstrated that expertise, with a long track record of business success. What matters is that Buffett dared to contradict a tenet of the alarmist viewpoint; Buffett suggested that to date, there has not been an increase in extreme weather events, due to Climate Change. To true believers, this divergence from climate dogma is intolerable; in their minds, Buffett must be wrong.
When the evidence contradicts green dogma, climate alarmists discard the evidence.

The Swiss online Baseler Zeitung here writes how the country’s Association for Pharmaceutical, Chemical and Biotech Companies is coming out against Switzerland’s recently proposed green “energy strategy”, saying that it is “fundamentally going in the wrong direction“.
The association fears it will lead to higher costs.
Energy politician Christian Wasserfallen “is pleased” about the message, the Baseler Zeitung writes.
The economy is slowly realizing what a threat the energy strategy poses.”
On the problems of supply reliability from sun and wind power, the Baseler Zeitung reports:
Just how little wind and sun really deliver was actually measured for example by Germany yesterday: The more than 120 billion euros worth of solar panels and wind turbines installed since 2000 delivered 4% and 1% respectively of German power demand.”
Huge Resistance Now Mounting Against German Green Energies
In another story, Benny Peiser of the London-based Global Warming Policy Foundation interviewed Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt, one of the founders of the environmental movement in Germany and the Chairman of the German Wildlife Trust. See full interview in the following video:

CO2 reductions backfire
On why CO2 is rising despite the 25 billion dollars annually spent on green energies, Vahrenholt says the system is set up in a way that ends up making coal more competitive, and so squeezes out the cleaner natural gas as the energy to provide the base load. He calls the system “contradictory in itself.”

google_ad_height = 200;

He adds that the government target of reducing energy consumption by 20% by 2020 “will never be achieved”, let alone reaching the CO2 emissions reductions target.
Host Benny Peiser reminds that the Energiewende costs the average household 300 euros annually, all to “subsidize the wealthy landowners, farmers, and the people with big houses who invest in renewables.” People have accepted the burden because they have been told it is to “save the world” and that government has played on the bad conscience of the collective German population for bad things done in the past, Vahrenholt said. On the issue “there is no political opposition in the Parliament. None.”
“New green movement” posing huge resistance
However Vahrenholt says that people in rural areas are now rising up against the destruction of the landscape and forests by wind energy. “What we see now is that biodiversity is destroyed by the measures against climate change.”
He says here there is huge resistance coming from a new green movement that eventually will make its way into the Parliament. He accuses the German Green Party of having abandoned its original mission of protecting nature and wildlife, and tell viewers that the green movement has begun to bicker and splinter.
Complete transformation of the landscape
Later he says plastering the country with over 50,000 turbines, as planned, would de facto mean a complete and profound transformation of the country’s romantic landscape. Already 240,000 bats per year fall victim to wind turbines each year, he notes.
Vahrenholt, a member of the SPD socialist party, reminds viewers that the green party has never really been green, but are in reality leftists disguised as environmentalists who are pursing an anti-industry, anti-technology and anti capitalism agenda in an attempt to fundamentally transform society. He says the energy policy silliness is being driven by an irrational belief in climate catastrophe.
Vahrenholt calls Germany’s exit from nuclear energy misguided and a mistake.
On the prospect of Germany returning to reason, the German professor says that it will depend on three factors: 1) if global temperature fails to rise, 2) on grid stability and 3) the destruction of nature in Germany, which is now “a growing concern”.

"Drugs approved in recent years that can cure hepatitis C may have severe side effects, including liver failure, a new report suggests. The number of adverse events appears relatively small, and the findings are not conclusive. But experts said the report was a warning that should not be ignored. It involves nine widely used antiviral drugs that were heralded as a huge advance because they greatly increased cure rates, seemingly with few side effects. The report will be published online on Wednesday by the Institute for Safe Medication Practices, a nonprofit in Horsham, Pa. that studies drug safety. Its findings are based on the group’s analysis of the Food and Drug Administration’s database of reports from doctors around the world of adverse events that might be related to medications. Dr. Robert S. Brown, the director of the Center for Liver Disease and Transplantation at   at Columbia and Weill Cornell, who was not involved in the study, said that there had been other, scattered accounts of problems with the new drugs and that they should be investigated further. “We don’t want people to ignore it and lead to risks to patients,” he said. “We don’t want people to overreact and not treat patients who should be treated. A lot of doctors are unclear about it, and if doctors are unclear, patients are, too. ” Dr. Brown added that problems might arise from some doctors’ prescribing incorrectly, giving the drugs to patients with liver function too poor to tolerate them or benefit from them. Hepatitis C is an enormous public health problem. Caused by a virus, it leads to chronic liver disease in most people who contract it, and some eventually develop cirrhosis and liver cancer. In the United States, an estimated 2. 7 million to 3. 9 million people have chronic hepatitis C, at least 20, 000 a year die from it and it is the leading cause of liver transplants, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Globally, the World Health Organization reports 130 million to 150 million current chronic cases, and 700, 000 deaths per year. The virus is   and the most common source of infection is   among people who use illicit drugs. In the United States before 1992, when a test became available to screen donated blood, many cases were caused by transfusions. In countries where the blood supply is not screened, transfusions still pose a risk. Needlestick injuries and other hospital accidents may also cause some cases. There is no vaccine to prevent the infection, so treatments have long been eagerly sought. The drugs covered in the new report include two blockbusters, Sovaldi and Harvoni, both made by Gilead Sciences and priced at $1, 000 a pill, with billions of dollars in sales. Sovaldi was approved in 2013, and Harvoni in 2014. These drugs and other antivirals can cure the disease in 12 weeks in many patients. Earlier drugs were less effective, had to be taken for much longer and had harsh side effects that left many patients unable to finish the course of therapy. About 250, 000 people took the newer drugs in 2015, the report said, at tremendous expense: $55, 000 to $125, 000 per patient. In those treated during the year ending June 30, 2016, the report identified 524 with liver failure, 165 of whom died. Of those with liver failure, 386 were from outside the United States. An additional 1, 058 had severe liver injury, and in 761 the drugs appeared not to work. But whether the drugs were to blame is not known. The problems were observed by doctors who suspected drugs were the cause, but that does not prove cause and effect. And details about the patients’ medical histories were not available. A spokesman for Gilead, Mark Snyder, wrote in an email, “We closely assess both   safety reports as well as safety data from our clinical trials on an ongoing basis and have found no suggestion of a causal relationship between Sovaldi or Harvoni and liver failure. ” He added that Gilead’s drugs had been approved for people with severe liver disease from hepatitis C, and that some would inevitably suffer liver failure despite the best treatment. The F. D. A. received a copy of the report, but declined to discuss it. A spokeswoman, Theresa Eisenman, wrote in an email, “The F. D. A. does not typically comment on specific studies, but evaluates them as part of the body of evidence to further our understanding about a particular issue and assist in our mission to protect public health. ” For all types of drugs, the agency received nearly 300, 000 new reports of adverse events during the second quarter of 2016, from the United States and other countries. Most of the events were described by doctors and other health professionals. Because reporting is voluntary for doctors, researchers generally suspect that many problems go unreported and that the real number is higher. In October, the F. D. A. identified the first major safety problem caused by the nine antiviral drugs. In 24 patients, the drugs wiped out hepatitis C  —   but also reactivated hepatitis B infections that had been dormant. Two of those patients died, and one needed a liver transplant. The agency said there were probably additional cases that had not been reported. As a result, the agency required that a boxed warning, its most prominent advisory, be added to the labeling of the newer antivirals, telling doctors to screen and monitor for hepatitis B in all patients taking the drugs for hepatitis C. Infection with both viruses is not common, and how the reactivation occurs is not known. The problem was not detected during premarket testing of the drugs because patients who currently had hepatitis B or who had a history of it were not allowed into the studies. With testing and the right treatment, Dr. Brown said, hepatitis B reactivation should be completely preventable. The other cases of liver failure are a separate problem. He said it was important for doctors prescribing the newer drugs to test patients’ liver function thoroughly first, because liver disease can be deceptive, and people who look well may actually be on the brink of liver failure and therefore not candidates for the drugs. Thomas J. Moore, a senior scientist at the Institute for Safe Medication Practices and an author of the report, said the study reflected a larger question about the drug approval process. Approval for the newer hepatitis C drugs was expedited because better treatments were so badly needed. But does the rush to market come at a price? “Gosh, here is something that really qualifies as a breakthrough, and we have policies to get it into use as quickly as possible, which means we know less about it,” Mr. Moore said. “Benefits and side effects evolve over the long term, not over 12 weeks. ”"
