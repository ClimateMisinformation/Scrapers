"In 1988, when the scientist James Hansen told a senate committee that it was “time to stop waffling so much and say that the evidence is pretty strong that the greenhouse effect is here”, those who took him seriously assumed that if they just persisted with emphasising that this terrible fact would eventually destroy us, action would be taken. Instead, the opposite happened: when confronted with the awful reality of climate change, most people tended to retreat into a panglossian vision of the future, or simply didn’t want to hear about it.  A lot of work has been done since to understand why climate change is so uniquely paralysing, most prominently by George Marshall, author of the book Don’t Even Think About It. Marshall describes climate change as “a perfect and undetectable crime everyone contributes to but for which no one has a motive”. Climate change is both too near and too far for us to be able to internalise: too near because we make it worse with every minute act of our daily lives; too far because until now it has been something that affects foreign people in foreign countries, or future versions of ourselves that we can only conceive of ephemerally. It is also too massive. The truth is if we don’t take action on climate change now, the food shortages, mass migration and political turmoil it will cause could see the collapse of civilisation in our lifetimes. Which of us can live with that knowledge? It’s not surprising, then, that some years ago climate activists switched to a message of optimism. They listened to studies that showed optimism was more galvanising than despair, and they began to talk about hope, empowerment, and success stories. They waited for some grand extreme weather event to make the final pieces fall into place. Maybe the submerging of New Orleans would be it; maybe some of the rich white people who were battered by Hurricane Sandy would use their privilege to demand action. Maybe Harvey or Irma – or now Maria – would cause us to snap out of our stupor. It hasn’t happened. Instead what I think a message of optimism has done is create a giant canyon between the reality of climate change and most people’s perception of it. An optimistic message has led to complacency – “people are saying it’s doable so it will probably be fine” – and championing success stories has convinced people that the pathetic, threadbare action taken by governments so far is sufficient. I’ve lost count of the sheer number of politically engaged, conscientious people I’ve met who have simply no idea how high the stakes are. The fact is, nobody knows how to solve the riddle of persuading the public to demand action on climate change. I certainly don’t have the answers. But I do think we need to contemplate that something is going disastrously wrong here – that perhaps it’s time to get back to the drawing board and rethink how we talk about climate change. Two significant things have happened since that senate committee hearing in 1988: the first is the Paris agreement in 2015 to try to limit warming to 1.5C – research out this week shows this is still possible. The second is that major parts of the dominant global superpower have been decimated by two Katrina-dwarfing storms in less than a month. Circumstances have changed in the past 30 years: climate change is a material fact now, and we have a specific target to aim for, to limit the damage it will cause. A new campaign could centre on the demand for governments to meet the 1.5C target, emphasising how dire the consequences will be if we don’t. People don’t need to imagine what climate change looks like any more: they can see it in the sea water that has enveloped the islands of the Caribbean, the drowning houses in Houston, the communiques from those who couldn’t escape, and prepared themselves to lose everything. In Britain we’ve seen floodwater inundate entire villages; a pub that became a thoroughfare for a swollen river. This is what catastrophe on our doorsteps looks like, and perhaps it’s time we link these images to climate change with as much gusto as the fossil fuel industry denies it. Could the language of emergency work? It has never been tried with as much meteorological evidence as we have now, and we’ve never had a target as clear and unanimous as the one agreed in Paris. The one thing I know is that the events of the last few months have changed the game, and this is the moment to start debating a new way to talk about climate change. It may be that if the time for a mass movement is not now, there won’t be one. • Ellie Mae O’Hagan is an editor at openDemocracy, and a freelance journalist"
"The White House has denied reports that it planned to stay in the Paris climate agreement, saying its position on leaving was unchanged, and that it would only stay in if it got more “favourable” terms. The Trump administration was forced to make a statement on Saturday after reports emerged as ministers from more than 30 countries held talks in Montreal this weekend preparing for the upcoming United Nations climate summit in November.  The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump administration officials had said at the Montreal talks that they wouldn’t pull out of the Paris accord and were offering to re-engage with the deal, citing the EU’s climate commissioner.  The WSJ quoted Cañete saying: “The US has stated that they will not renegotiate the Paris accord, but they will try to review the terms on which they could be engaged under this agreement.” According to the AFP news agency, Cañete also said there would be a meeting on the sidelines of the UN general assembly in New York City early next week with US representatives “to assess what is the real US position”, and noted: “It’s a message which is quite different to the one we heard from President Trump in the past.” Trump provoked outcry among the majority of world leaders and the science community when he gave notice earlier this year that Paris was a bad deal for the US and he would pull the country out of the deal to cut emissions. On Saturday, responding to the reports, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in an email to the Guardian: “There has been no change in the United States’ position on the Paris agreement. As the President has made abundantly clear, the United States is withdrawing unless we can re-enter on terms that are more favorable to our country”. Ministers from 34 economies are meeting in Montreal in part to head off potential efforts by the US to weaken the accord at the November UN climate summit in Bonn, Germany.  Our position on the Paris agreement has not changed. @POTUS has been clear, US withdrawing unless we get pro-America terms. Though Trump said in June that the country would pull out of the Paris accord, there has been little effort by the US to formally extricate itself from the agreement. Half the G20 is represented at the weekend meeting in Montreal, though there are no senior US climate officials in attendance.  The US delegation is headed by Everett Eissenstat, deputy director of the US National Economic Council.  After the summit, Cañete is set to travel to New York and meet Trump adviser Gary Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, on Monday. "
"Many effects of global warming appear gradually but can cause sudden and devastating changes. A rise in sea levels is one; it makes estuaries and lagoons slightly more saline, which in the case of the Norfolk Broads, suddenly threatened a big attraction, angling. This is because tiny “golden” algae called Prymnesium parvum, which thrive in slightly saline or mineral rich water, can turn toxic, suffocating the fish by destroying their gills.  What exactly turns harmless algae into a large-scale menace is not fully understood but, in Norfolk and other places where changes in temperature and salinity have occurred, it has caused a series of calamities. In 2015, when a large toxic bloom occurred in Hickling Broad and Somerton, thousands of fish died and 700,000 were rescued by a joint effort between the Environment Agency and angling clubs. The rescue cost £40,000 but saved the fishery. Since about 40% of the income from the Broads derives from angling this represents a serious economic threat to the area as well as an environmental disaster. Before the Prymnesium outbreaks began, this area was one of the most important pike fisheries in Europe. Fortunately a solution to the problem has been found and, surprisingly, it is hydrogen peroxide, often used for bleaching hair. In dilute quantities, it is a way of adding oxygen to large bodies of water when fish are in distress. Scientists at the John Innes Centre in Norwich have discovered that slightly larger concentrations kill the algae but harm nothing else. "
"Tens of millions of dollars are spent annually on political lobbying for the interests of the fossil fuel sector. That investment serves the interests of a small amount of company shareholders in keeping a legacy industry alive, despite the availability of newer, clean technologies, at lower cost.  In the wake of these behind-the-scenes policy negotiations, the real and present impacts of climate change, such as bushfires, coastal flooding and reduced crop yields are left at the door of future generations to deal with.   As the expensive fees of industry associations like the Minerals Council of Australia are claimed as business expenses, the fossil fuel companies are then able to receive generous tax concessions – paid for from the public purse. That’s why the hypocrisy was palpable last week, when the deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce said in an address to the Minerals Council that the charitable status of environmental groups is against the interests of Australia. So, when there are no rules limiting the power that big mining wields over politics, why are environmental scientists being attacked by the government? Recently, the government instituted an inquiry into Australian charities, seeking to curb the work of charities working to protect the environment. The inquiry’s most concerning recommendation, which came from the Minerals Council itself, is that all environmental charities, no matter if they are focused on research or public education, should be forced to spend 25% of their resources for on-the-ground remediation work, such as tree planting and weed control. Environmental remediation has great value, but ultimately the policy change required to solve climate change will only happen through scientifically informed policy change that allows businesses and communities to do the heavy lifting.  The Climate Council is an independent organisation dedicated to public education on climate change. We want to keep doing what we’re good at – which is providing independent, accurate information to Australians across society; from emergency services to farmers, schools and businesses. For the government to demand that the Climate Council spend 25% of its time on remediation is nonsensical and undemocratic. When it comes to Australia staying in step with the global race to address climate change, planting a few trees just won’t cut it. The government inquiry is a cynical attempt to hamper support for charities by reducing our ability to execute on our purpose. The Climate Council’s purpose is to accurately communicate information on climate change, giving Australia the chance to be on the front foot in responding to climate change. Our information assists fire fighters, health professionals and communities. It helps journalists to report more accurately in what is a debate often awash with misinformation. Importantly, it helps the wider community make sense of what is a complex and confusing issue.  An informed public is absolutely vital to a well-functioning democracy. The science is not the only consensus on the issue. Most Aussies are worried about what climate change means for their jobs, property and families, especially the youngsters that are now stepping up to power our economy. For the government to adopt the mining lobby’s recommendation would damage the ability of organisations protecting the environment to work effectively – and therefore damage our environment itself. It would also set a dangerous precedent for the interference of vested interests into our government. For beyond the Climate Council a broad range of charities stand to be affected should the government give itself powers to hamper any community group that they deem to be in conflict with its worldview. The logic of curtailing an organisation like Climate Council, which fills the major chasm in public information on climate change, is unscientific and undemocratic.  Despite what we hear about the post-truth, fake news world in which we now live, the Australian public still values independent experts. When we go to the doctor, or fly in an aeroplane, we place our trust in the hands of qualified experts. Equally, for Australia to make sound decisions on our changing world, we expect to be advised by experts that operate independently of vested interests.  Past experience tells us we cannot rely on government to give us all of the facts, all of the time. Just last year it was widely reported that the Australian Department of Environment censored a Unesco report on climate change, removing the inclusion of the Great Barrier Reef, Kakadu national park and the Tasmanian forests. The objections were made on the grounds that showing the impacts of climate change on Australian world heritage sites would be bad for tourism. When Unesco agreed to remove the sections requested, Australia became the only inhabited continent on the planet with no mention whatsoever. It would be a wonderful world if the threat of climate change could be wiped away so easily. In the absence of a magic wand, both the Australian public and the broader international community have a right to accurate information in order to tackle climate change. We have a responsibility to future generations to take action. And our best chance for action is from the standpoint of knowledge that is open, shared and freely available. I have no doubt that a government that has the best interests of the Australian public at heart is one that champions and protects access to science and does not seek to restrict it."
"Refugees fleeing conflict have already sent shockwaves ‎through the political systems of Europe. But unless we take urgent action now and help the countries of the Sahel, we will face the prospect of millions more refugees in the time to come.  A coordinated and comprehensive plan to partner these nations and help them to avoid catastrophe is essential for them and for us. It should be devised by an alliance between Europe, the US and Arab allies in the Gulf.  The Sahel – the belt of countries stretching for 3,360 miles across sub-Saharan Africa from the Sahara in the north to the Sudan Savanna in the south – is dominated by the G5 Sahel group of Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger, which in July launched a new military force together with President Emmanuel Macron to tackle Islamist militants. These countries are buckling under the weight of the challenges of “fragile states”: poverty, food security, weak governance, ethnic tensions and the spread of radical extremism. These problems are not in themselves exclusive, but two factors make them unique – and call for a new approach. First, huge population growth will see the combined population of these G5 nations grow from 78 million today to more than 200 million by 2050. Aid in its traditional sense cannot outrun these numbers. Population growth brings with it many more young people needing jobs. High youth unemployment increases the risks of human trafficking, slavery, crime and violence. Population growth will also further stress the natural environment, which is already prone to climate change-induced droughts that result in crops failing and livestock dying, forcing people to migrate. Nearly five million people have already been displaced in the region. Second is the risk that local conflicts and extremist movements join together across porous borders, aided by technology. The early warning signs are here. The UN peacekeeping operation in Mali is already one of its deadliest missions. Alongside Boko Haram, the four main groups in the region – al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb, al-Murabitoun, Macina Liberation Front and Ansar Dine – merged into a single entity this year, fuelling the probability of further violence. We need a programme specifically designed for the Sahel – a formal compact between the nations and the international community. Analysis from my institute, which has projects supporting governments in 12 African countries, shows that the problem in fragile states is that donor aid is often less effective because it lacks buy-in from the national leadership and they do not have the capacity to use the aid well. This is confirmed by the Brookings Institute report, which analysed aid and compared fragile and stable states.  The problems are so many and so deep that governments become overwhelmed. This is why a compact must be comprehensive, covering all the different dimensions to development – including security – and must be based on a partnership with clear and measurable objectives in return for help. This is not aid in the traditional way, but a sensible investment in the protection of our own future. Another novel feature would be that it involves non-traditional development partners in the nations to the east, who will also be greatly impacted by failure in the Sahel. The compact should also be tailored for each nation, based on need. It must be built in the spirit of partnership and mutual accountability, balancing obligations and support and learning from other initiatives, such as the Millennium Challenge Corporation, already active in the region. And finally, the governments should be provided not just with financial support but with embedded technical assistance. This will be key to implementing the necessary reforms and building local capability. It will not be quick; fragile states are not rebuilt in a few years – even with the best will in the world. But the need is urgent, and elsewhere on the continent countries such as Botswana, Rwanda and Ethiopia have undertaken reforms focused on building state capacity and generating growth. I am convinced that a new path forward can be forged. A path where Sahelian governments get the right kind of partnership to build an effective government that can tackle its own challenges and, in time, transition away from aid.  At the most fundamental level, the people of these nations have the same desires as us in the west: for peace, stability, good health, education and the opportunity for meaningful work. It is the only vision of the future that works, not least because problems in countries which seem far away may well be closer than we think."
"Overseas tourists have begun to doubt the value of a trip to the ailing Great Barrier Reef and it is getting increasingly difficult to “show people what they expect to see”, a dive operator has told a federal Senate inquiry. A Port Douglas operator, John Edmondson, said “last-chance tourism” was spurring on other visitors but there had been a “weird” lull in bookings this year after back-to-back mass bleaching events made dead coral an unavoidable sight on reef visits.  Edmondson told the environment and communications committee in Cairns on Tuesday that while experienced reef tourists still hailed the Great Barrier Reef as the world’s best coral expanse, it was “harder to get the coral and show people what they expect to see”. He said packages that cost the average family $800 for a day on the reef were becoming a harder sell, with “forward bookings definitely softer this year”. This was despite a favourable exchange rate and security concerns in other countries with reef destinations, he told the committee, which is running an inquiry into the impact of climate change on the marine environment. European reef visitors were routinely raising the issue of Australian government support for the Adani mine as a sign it was “going in the wrong direction” in its policy on climate change – the reef’s greatest threat, Edmondson said. The Queensland Liberal National senator Ian Macdonald asked Edmondson, who studied marine biology, whether he believed “like [former US president Barack] Obama” it was the last chance to see the reef. “It’s nearly the last chance,” Edmondson said. While visitors to the reef were still deeply impressed, “you’re getting a creeping increase of people that had a great day – but you can see there was a lot of dead coral”, he said. Asked by Macdonald if he deliberately took tourists to “dead coral places”, Edmondson said: “You can’t avoid dead coral. “I think what’s happening now is some people think it’s just not worth it because of what they’ve seen and read, and that’s offset by other people that know it’s only going to get worse, and see it now.” Edmondson’s business, Wavelength Reef Cruises, takes 22,000 people a year to see the reef, employs 20 people including marine biology graduates and takes $4.5m in revenue a year. It was “a fantastic business at the moment” but the “very poor trajectory” of the reef was a real concern and he had held back a $3m investment in a fourth boat, Edmondson said. “We’ve postponed our decision because with the current situation you just don’t want to be too exposed,” he said. Macdonald questioned why tourists were linking Adani to the state of the reef, saying: “I struggle to see the connection.” Edmondson said most travellers were “fairly wealthy, they’re mostly educated, they’re aware of what’s in the media” and those with knowledge of coral reefs understood the key threat to the reef was climate change. They saw support for the Adani mine as counter to moves towards a lower carbon economy, he said. “If you come from the UK or France or Holland, windmills are a more common thing, renewable energy, much more electric cars – are we deserving of their money as custodians of the reef?” Edmondson told Macdonald that “politically I’m basically a Liberal voter who gets frustrated that, [on] the right wing of the centre right of politics, basically environmental issues are pushed over to the other side”.  The broader public did not know what to believe about the reef amid “sensationalist” media coverage of the bleaching and responses from an industry that had left “real gap in advocacy for the reef” on climate change, he said. Tropical Tourism North Queensland had sent an email urging its dive operator members by email to provide a “tsunami” of good news stories to counter bad publicity. “The reality is that there’s been a very dramatic change and a shifting in baseline in a lot of areas,” Edmondson said. “You can still go out and have a fantastic day and the reef is still probably the best-managed reef in the world. “But it’s an expensive day. It’s $250 [a person] for most boats to go out to the reef and people have got a very high expectation. “To give them their value for money and give them a good product is getting harder and harder because it’s harder to get the coral and show people what they expect to see.”"
"The winds and rain came first, usual for this time of year. Crops drown in the sodden earth, the price of vegetables and fruits in the market rises and, as the rain and wind beat down on the tin roofs and wooden frames of many of our homes, communities bear down for more. Torrential storms, gushing flood waters and devastated infrastructure come next, and lives are lost in their wake. Evacuation is not an option for most citizens of the Caribbean. Instead of escape, survival is a matter of endurance. What were predictable changes to the wet or dry months in the Caribbean are now increasingly irregular weather patterns, bringing serious weather events that demand more resources and attention to mitigate escalating damage, including loss of life. There is widespread agreement in the region, based on meteorological data as well as lived experience, that Caribbean seasons, noteworthy for shifts in temperature and precipitation, are changing. As residents in the region, sometimes we wonder if “change” is a powerful enough word to represent the realities of rising seas and battering rains, coastal erosion and habitat loss, new agricultural stresses and higher food import bills, as well as the loss of human life. Despite broad consensus, we must be clear that climate change is not the only villain. Regional underdevelopment and global economic polarisation exacerbate the effects of disasters. The colossal convergence of clouds formed by the churning of warm waters in the Atlantic basin has generated three fully formed hurricanes since tropical storm Harvey passed through the eastern Caribbean in mid-August: hurricanes Irma, Jose and Katia. The Atlantic basin has not seen activity of this nature since 2010 when category three hurricanes Igor and Karl joined category four Julia to bring disastrous impacts to Caribbean islands. None of these previous hurricanes, however, were nearly as devastating as Irma’s category five assault, which has resulted in 28 confirmed deaths across the Caribbean so far – and thousands will be displaced. Those whose lives have been washed away, leaving them without shelter, include street dwellers, homeless people, squatters and others living precariously in rural, hillside, and coastal areas, which are prone to landslides, collapse and flooding. Also vulnerable are elderly people, children and people who are mobility-impaired or sick and may more quickly succumb to the health effects of mould, poor nutrition and lack of clean drinking water, exacerbated by constraints in accessing medical help. In addition to flood losses in residential, agricultural, and commercial areas, winds destabilise transport and communication infrastructure, while storm surges dismantle much needed economic, social, and environmental assets on coastlines. Disasters, as we know them, are a function of magnitude, exposure, and vulnerability. On its own, Irma has characteristics that could make it one of the Caribbean’s most damaging hurricanes on record, due in part to the low levels of economic development that hamper the region’s ability to cope with natural hazards. Irma’s path of destruction has affected more than 10 Caribbean countries, a significantly higher number of islands than those affected by hurricanes Igor, Julia, and Karl combined. While Igor, Julia, and Karl directly affected islands including Bermuda and Cape Verde, Irma made landfall on Antigua, Barbuda, Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands, the US Virgin Islands, Turks and Caicos, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, St Kitts, Nevis, and Guadeloupe among others. Bermuda and Cape Verde have substantially higher GDPs and GDP per capita than Barbuda and Anguilla, which strongly correlate to higher resilience and much better coping mechanisms. For example, in Barbuda Irma destroyed more than 90% of the housing stock and telecommunications infrastructure; large and extended families, including one group of seven, were reliant on rooftop rescues by emergency responders. Similar incidents have been reported from Anguilla and other islands. By comparison, although serious damage was reported in Bermuda and Cape Verde, nothing nearly as devastating as this occurred. These two islands can expect to return to normal life much more quickly than the islands with fewer economic resources. Clearly, the impacts of such storms and the course of the subsequent recovery are determined by a country’s preparedness and capacity to respond. At both the national and community levels, development provides protective armour. Mismanagement of resources and failure to protect the environment pose a grave threat to small-island developing states As we look to the future, we must heed the lessons taught by these hurricanes. While it is not possible to modify the hazard of a hurricane such as Irma in itself, there are ways to reduce the disastrous effects, and increase coping capacities and resilience of those affected. With dwindling funding for disaster risk reduction in the Caribbean, there is a growing need to encourage self-protective resilience. Education and communication are crucial tools, and we must develop new techniques to identify the most vulnerable communities, groups and households. The climate chaos represented by the increased magnitude and heightened form of storm activity in the Atlantic basin is becoming the norm for the Caribbean. The regional realities of this chaos have been masked by the discourse of “climate change”, which suggests a more manageable and gradual process. In June and July tropical storms Bret and Don also passed through the Caribbean as far south as Trinidad, an island that had previously seen a total of only four tropical storms since records began in 1851. The mismanagement of natural resources and failure to protect the environment pose a grave threat to many of us living in small-island developing states and less economically developed countries. Ultimately, just as the health of the oceans and atmosphere are related to one another, so the current plight of countries on the periphery is the best indicator of the future of the core. • Dr Gabrielle Thongs specialises in disaster planning and spatial modelling at the University of the West Indies."
"A tropical storm that is on course to break the US record for the heaviest rainfall from a tropical system. Meteorologists say the 120cm-mark set in 1978 could be surpassed on Tuesday or Wednesday.  At least 14 people have died, tens of thousands have been evacuated and more have been stranded as catastrophic flooding has paralysed the home of the US oil industry and the fourth most populous city in the US. Almost certainly, according to a statement issued by the World Meteorological Organization on Tuesday. “Climate change means that when we do have an event like Harvey, the rainfall amounts are likely to be higher than they would have been otherwise,” the UN organisation’s spokeswoman Clare Nullis told a conference. Correct. Nobody is arguing that climate change caused the storm, but it is likely to have made it much worse. Warmer seas evaporate more quickly. Warmer air holds more water vapour. So, as temperatures rise around the world, the skies store more moisture and dump it more intensely. There is a proven link – known as the Clausius-Clapeyron equation – that shows that for every half a degree celsius in warming, there is about a 3% increase in atmospheric moisture content. It was a factor. The surface temperature in the Gulf of Mexico is currently more than half a degree celsius higher than the recent late summer average, which is in turn more than half a degree higher than 30 years ago, according to Michael Mann of Penn State University. As a result there was more potential for a deluge.  The US National Weather Service has had to introduce a new colour on its graphs to deal with the volume of precipitation. Harvey surpassed the previous US record for rainfall from a tropical system, as 49.2 inches was recorded at Mary’s Creek at Winding Road in Southeast Houston, at 9.20am on Tuesday. Yes, the storm surge was greater because sea levels have risen 20cm as a result of more than 100 years of human-related global warming. This has melted glaciers and thermally expanded the volume of seawater. The science here is more tentative, as is the possible link to global warming. Harvey’s wind speed rose by about 45mph in the 24 hours before it reached the coast, according to National Hurricane Center. Computer simulations at Massachusetts Institute of Technology have indicated that similarly rapid increases in storm speeds will be 10 to 20 times more likely to occur by the end of this century than they were during the 1900s as a result of rising greenhouse gas emissions. This is the single most important question posed by Harvey, according to Tim Palmer, Royal Society Research Professor at the University of Oxford. There is not yet a clear link between this and climate change. But scientists have observed a general slowdown of atmospheric summer circulation in the mid-latitudes as a result of strong warming in the Arctic. “This can make weather systems move less and stay longer in a given location – which can significantly enhance the impacts of rainfall extremes, just like we’re sadly witnessing in Houston,” noted Stefan Rahmstorf, a co-chair at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. Attribution is a relatively nascent science, but increasingly sophisticated computer models use temperature records, emission figures and recent data to calculate how the rise in greenhouse gases has increased the risk of a hotter world. Last year, researchers with World Weather Attribution and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimated that man-made emissions nearly doubled the odds of last year’s heavy rains in Louisiana. This summer, they found the heatwave that struck Portugal and Spain was 10 times more likely to have occurred due to global warming. Once the deluge in Texas abates, they may be able to crunch the numbers for Harvey. Not as yet. Trump previously called manmade climate change a myth invented by China. As president, he has announced the US will withdraw from the Paris agreement. On Twitter, his take on Harvey has been incredulity: “HISTORIC rainfall in Houston, and all over Texas. Floods are unprecedented, and more rain coming” and “Even experts have said they’ve never seen one like this!”"
"That which is dangerous can also be thrilling. Many liberal democracies are engaged in something dangerous, as questions of identity, community and nationhood are being asked with a fresh urgency, with some of the answers turning out to be deeply disturbing. But is there also something thrilling going on? The capacity for democracy to throw up surprises, such as Britain’s 2017 general election result, is mesmerising. Brexit may be a famous act of economic self-harm, but something new will be born one way or the other. Still the danger persists and may be growing. That this is happening now, as opposed to 10 or 20 years ago, is a direct consequence of the disintegration of the economic policy framework that has held sway in Britain, the US, the European commission and many multilateral institutions for much of the previous 40 years. That framework is often referred to as “neoliberalism”, even if the term irritates a certain class of pundit, for whom it is some sort of swearword without any clear referent. Its disintegration is producing conflicting sympathies, as many on the left come to realise the xenophobia that can be unleashed in the absence of stable market-based rules.  For George Monbiot, neoliberalism should best be understood as a “story”, one that was conveniently on offer at precisely the moment when the previous “story” – namely Keynesianism – fell to pieces in the mid-1970s. The power of stories is overwhelming, as they are “the means by which we navigate the world. They allow us to interpret its complex and contradictory signals”. The particular story of neoliberalism “defines us as competitors, guided above all other impulses by the urge to get ahead of our fellows”. This story may not have been all that attractive, but it provided meaning and clarity. It offered a guide on what to do and how to live. With the rise of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, neoliberalism came to govern how policies were designed and institutions constructed. More diffusely, it came to shape how we understand ourselves, leading us to take on ever more responsibility for our own needs, economic security and wellbeing, devaluing social bonds and dependency in the process. The grand global difficulties of neoliberalism are plain to see. The financial crisis was testimony to the stupidity of deregulation, while the inability to move on from it demonstrates that orthodox economic policy tools no longer work. Solutions to climate change are hamstrung by the need to respect existing corporate and financial strategies. But Monbiot also details considerable psychological and biological evidence for how the ethos of individual competition harms us all, running counter to our innate needs and instincts. Loneliness and distrust are not just the defining social problems of our age, but increasingly posing risks to our health. The problem is that we have no new story to tell, and are therefore trapped in a groundhog day of repetition. The principal objective of Out of the Wreckage is to identify exit routes from this miserable condition. Few of the policy ideas contained within it are original to Monbiot (he credits their sources regularly and generously) and some (such as participatory budgeting and basic income) have been around for some time, but they are rarely assembled into a single overarching narrative. Monbiot is offering his services principally as a storyteller. He reserves particular enthusiasm for the environmental economics of Kate Raworth and the participatory campaigning techniques of the Bernie Sanders campaign. To construct the new story, he leans heavily on the burgeoning evidence for our innately social and empathetic nature. Human beings are the “supreme cooperators”, which explains our dominance within the natural world. Altruism and concern for others’ feelings are evolutionary properties that are central to our biology, hence the fact that “social” pain (such as loneliness or grief) produces many of the same symptoms as “physical” pain. Most of this research was unknown when the neoliberal story was first being told by economists such as Friedrich von Hayek in the mid-20th century, but it highlights central aspects of the human condition that are neglected by our individualistic and competitive culture. What this suggests, Monbiot argues, is that a new political story must privilege belonging above all. We need to feel we belong to a particular place and a particular community, with whom we can achieve common goals. We need to combat the epidemic of alienation with a new set of institutions, through which individuals can collectively shape their own lives and environments. Out of the Wreckage makes an impassioned and optimistic case for greater democracy in virtually all areas of life, from global to local, kicking big money out of politics in the process. At the same time, Monbiot’s intuition regarding “belonging” resonates with the present political mood. Was it not a desire for belonging that drove much of the Brexit vote, or at least a sense of not belonging to Brussels? This is a highly contemporary book, potentially offering the left a set of implements with which to win arguments on terrain often dominated by the populist right. After the depressing sight of Boris Johnson touring ex-industrial regions in a bus promising NHS funding that he knew would never materialise, the need for a more sincere vision of how people might “take back control” remains pressing. Monbiot’s hopeful, practical energy is precisely what the left needs right now. Some of it borders on the utopian, but then so did Hayek’s story. Optimism does produce its blind spots. Monbiot is alive to the thrill of popular power, but the dangers are absent. He touches on the pessimistic vision of Thomas Hobbes, the 17th-century philosopher who argued that the central function of the state is to stop us slaughtering each other, given our innately suspicious and arrogant nature. “Today,” Monbiot reassures us, “knowing what we do about the nature and origins of humanity, we can state unequivocally” that Hobbes’s view “is mistaken”. We’d all like this to be true (even Hobbes would have done), but that’s a brave call, especially on the post-neoliberal precipice on which we stand. The yearning for belonging has historically been associated with romantic conservatism, although Monbiot offers some good counterexamples, such as the Clarion magazine, which formed socialist societies and ramblers’ and cycling clubs during the 1890s. In the current climate, this poses a couple of questions, at least for the less optimistic reader. One is whether democratic participation can deliver the same sense of belonging as the darker political forces that are stirring, with their promise to look after their own and lock out the others. If the left is to start a conversation about belonging, it needs to be confident that it can finish it. After all, there is another storyteller in Britain, also challenging the cult of GDP growth and prioritising a sense of belonging: his name is Nigel Farage. It is far from certain that democracy – even thriving, inclusive democracy – will produce the happy social and environmental outcomes Monbiot expects it to, including a respect for science. The indeterminacy of popular power is both its thrill and its danger. At one point Monbiot writes expertly on how to combine music, “energisers” and speakers to convert the vitality of protest marches into more lasting campaign outcomes. “The energiser would bring back the musicians to lead the crowd in an anthem: there’s no better way of generating a sense of solidarity and shared emotion,” which sounds as much like a Trump rally as the ones that attract Monbiot’s sympathies. Monbiot might well respond that severe dangers have already been realised, in the form of climate change, political corruption, psychological distress and inequality. Why live in fear of emerging enemies, when the established ones are already running amok? Out of the Wreckage is partly an activists’ manual, which aims to coordinate and energise those who want a different world. You don’t build an evocative story out of warnings and fears.

"A painter who won a prestigious British portrait award sponsored by BP has donated part of his winnings to Greenpeace in protest at his art being used to promote the image of the multinational oil company. Henry Christian-Slane, an artist from New Zealand, won the BP young artist award at the National Portrait Gallery for a painting of his partner Gabi. The high profile prize, which was chosen out of 2,580 entries, came with £7,000 prize money, which was presented by BP’s chief executive Bob Dudley.  Christian-Slane, 26, said he was happy to receive the accolade but was not comfortable “about being part of BP’s PR strategy”. He said as a “symbolic act” of defiance he was donating £1,000 of the prize-money to Greenpeace projects that directly protested against BP’s extraction of fossil fuels from the ground.  “I hope this action will help keep the issue of BP’s role in climate change from being overshadowed by their contribution to the arts,” he said. “I was very uncomfortable with the idea that the portrait award was being used to improve BPs image. Big oil companies like BP have the power to prevent the fossil fuels in the ground from entering the atmosphere as greenhouse gases, and we need to keep pressure on them to accept this responsibility. The individual has a role to play in this.” Greenpeace and the alliance of campaign groups Art Not Oil have long protested against arts institutions accepting sponsorship from the oil giant, and previous protest actions have included climate activists spending 25 hours scrawling messages on the floor of the Tate’s Turbine Hall. Last year it was announced that BP’s sponsorship of the National Portrait Gallery portrait prize would continue for another five years, and the company announced it would invest £7.5m in other major cultural institutions such as the British Museum, Royal Opera House and Royal Shakespeare Company. The deals prompted an open letter of condemnation by figures such as Mark Rylance. Commenting on Christian-Slane’s gesture, Sara Ayech, oil campaigner for Greenpeace UK, thanked the artist for his his principled stand against “art’s co-option by the oil industry.”  She added: “Purchasing a dominant position in London’s cultural scene is starting to become a bit of a double-edged sword for BP. As Henry has demonstrated, not everyone can be bought, and while BP are maintaining their brand’s relationship with the city’s elites, they are also providing a platform for the environmental damage they do around the world to be exposed in front of their home audience.”"
"Tomorrow, the horticultural industry gathers in Birmingham at the Glee international garden show, with the major high street retailers deciding how and what we will grow in our gardens next year. Yet among the commercial bustle, there remains a deafening silence that shames this £5bn business and our national passion – why is peat still being used in our gardens? The importance of our remaining peatlands to people and planet is hard to overstate. They are the unrivalled kings of carbon storage. Known peatlands cover about 3% of the world’s land surface yet store twice as much carbon as all of Earth’s standing forest and provide a haven to unique wildlife – from threatened wild flowers through dragonflies to curlews. Yet 2m cubic metres of peat are sold annually for us to plant begonias and tomatoes.   There is growing demand for peat-free alternatives: a 2017 survey conducted by Plantlife, Friends of the Earth, RSPB and the Wildlife Trusts established that consumers are crying out for peat-free products, yet a third of respondents couldn’t find peat-free compost clearly available. And sales of peat are still increasing despite the looming 2020 government ban. Carbon-rich peat, dating back millennia and growing at a rate of only 1mm a year, makes up over half of the compost sold every year in the UK. The government needs to give a shot of adrenalin to its commitment to phase out peat and support the industry to divest away from peat and keep what remains safely protected in the ground not the grow bag.Martin Harper Director, Global Conservation, RSPBStephanie Hilborne CEO, Wildlife TrustsBen McCarthy Director of strategy, PlantlifePaul de Zylva Senior nature campaigner, Friends of the Earth • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters"
"The number of hungry people in the world has increased for the first time since the turn of the century, sparking concern that conflict and climate change could be reversing years of progress. In 2016, the number of chronically undernourished people reached 815 million, up 38 million from the previous year. The increase is due largely to the proliferation of violence and climate-related shocks, according to the state of food insecurity and nutrition in 2017, a report produced by five UN agencies.  The study also noted a rise in the number of people globally who are chronically hungry, from 10.6% in 2015 to 11% in 2016. Cindy Holleman, a senior economist at the Food and Agriculture Organisation, said it was hard to know whether the increase was a blip or marked the reversal of a long-term trend. However, she said the rise in conflict and climate change – factors that rank alongside economic slowdown, which makes food hard to access for poor people, as key drivers of food insecurity – was cause for concern. “Whether it has been a blip and it’s going to go back down again, we’re not sure,” said Holleman. “But we’re sending warning signals. We are sending a message that something is going on. “If you look at the 815 million [chronically undernourished] people, 489 million or 60% of them are located in countries affected by conflict. Over the last decade we’re seen a significant increase in conflict. We also see that conflict combined with climatic effects is having a significant effect.” A foreword to the report, written jointly by the heads of the five UN agencies, said: “Over the past decade, conflicts have risen dramatically in number and become more complex and intractable in nature. “This has set off alarm bells we cannot afford to ignore: we will not end hunger and all forms of malnutrition by 2030 unless we address all the factors that undermine food security and nutrition. Securing peaceful and inclusive societies is a necessary condition to that end.” Oxfam’s head of food and climate change, Robin Willoughby, said:“This must act as a wake-up call for international leaders and institutions to do more to resolve the catastrophic cocktail of climate change and conflict around the world. Global failure to tackle these issues affects us all, but it’s the world’s poorest who will suffer most.” The report is the first UN global assessment of food security and nutrition following the adoption of the sustainable development goals, which aim to end hunger and all forms of malnutrition by 2030. Progress has been made on reducing global hunger, which affected more than 900 million people at the turn of the century. Over the past year, however, hunger has reached an “extreme level” in many parts of the world, with famine declared in South Sudan in February, and Yemen, north-east Nigeria and Somalia considered on the brink. People living in countries affected by protracted crisis are nearly two and a half times more likely to be undernourished than those living elsewhere, the report said. Fuelled partly by extreme weather patterns resulting from El Niño, food security “deteriorated sharply” in parts of sub-Saharan Africa, and in south-east and western Asia, said the report. Chronic child malnutrition continues to fall, but at a slower rate in some regions, the report found. Wasting remains a threat to the lives of 52 million children. Overweight and obesity rates in children are rising in most regions, and in all regions for adults. Such “multiple burdens” for malnutrition is a “cause for serious concern”, said the report. Africa has the highest levels of severe food insecurity, affecting 27.4% of the population – almost four times that of any other region. Higher food insecurity was also observed in Latin America, rising from 4.7% to 6.4%."
"As the US comes to terms with its second major weather disaster within a month, an important question is whether the devastation caused by hurricanes Harvey and Irma will convince Donald Trump and his administration of the reality of climate change.  The president’s luxurious Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida may escape Irma’s wrath, but with the deaths of so many Americans, and billions of dollars in damage to homes and businesses, the costs of climate change denial are beginning to pile up at the door of the White House. Just days before Harvey formed in the Atlantic last month, Trump signed an executive order to overturn a policy, introduced by his predecessor Barack Obama, to help American communities and businesses become more resilient against the risks of flooding, which are rising because of climate change. But the merciless assault on the US mainland by Harvey and Irma should be forcing the president to recognise the consequences of his arrogance and complacency in dismissing the research and analysis carried out by scientists. The flooded streets of Houston and the wind-ravaged homes of south Florida bear the unmistakable fingerprint of extreme weather made worse by manmade greenhouse gas emissions. A hurricane is a huge, rotating cluster of thunderstorms that forms above a sea surface that has a temperature of at least 26.5C. It is like a giant engine, transferring heat from the sea surface up into the atmosphere and generating strong winds and heavy rain in the process. The Atlantic hurricane season officially runs from 1 June until 30 November, and typically produces 12 tropical storms, of which six reach hurricane strength – with sustained wind speeds of more than 73mph. There have been 11 storms so far this year, including six hurricanes. In early August, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration raised its prediction for the season to “above normal”, suggesting that the final tally could be up to 19 storms, with nine of them hurricanes. But this season has already been remarkable in one respect because two major hurricanes, with sustained winds of more than 110mph, have hit the US mainland, after a period of 12 years when none of the strongest storms made American landfall. Hurricane Irma has also set records for being the strongest hurricane to have occurred in the open Atlantic, and for having sustained wind speeds of at least 185mph over the longest period. Climate change cannot be blamed for the hurricane count in any single season, nor for the occurrence of any single storm, but there are three ways in which it is making the consequences worse. First, although the intensity of a hurricane depends on many factors, warmer seawater tends to promote stronger storms. Average sea surface temperatures have been rising, and some parts of the North Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico are warmer than average at the moment, which is a key reason why both Harvey and Irma became so strong so quickly. Second, a warmer atmosphere can hold more water vapour, which can result in heavier rainfall. That is true not only for hurricanes but also for weaker storms across the world. Even relatively mild tropical storms can cause great damage by dropping huge volumes of rain over one area. Third, apart from strong winds and heavy rainfall, hurricanes cause damage through storm surges as their winds push seawater ahead of them. Storm surges can inundate extensive low-lying coastal areas, sweeping away everything in their path. Sea levels have been gradually rising globally, making storm surges bigger and deadlier. Scientists are still not sure about the other ways in which climate change may be impacting hurricanes. The main reason Harvey created such extreme flooding around Houston was that it stalled over the city and dumped rain for several days without moving on. We do not know if climate change played a role in creating the atmospheric conditions that made that happen. Nor can we yet predict whether climate change will affect the number of hurricanes that occur every year. Some studies have suggested that while numbers will drop, strengths will increase. Also uncertain is how natural climate variability affects hurricanes. Numbers have increased markedly in the North Atlantic since the 1990s, but this seems to be due, at least partly, to large-scale changes in ocean circulation that occur over many years or decades. However, it is clear that the lives and livelihoods of millions of Americans will be at risk if Trump and his administration continue to deny the existence of climate change and its impact on the threat posed by hurricanes.

"A new analysis looking at the long-term trends of more than 900 species of wildlife in Canada has found that half of them have seen their populations decline, including several species already listed as threatened or endangered. The Living Planet Report Canada, released on Thursday by World Wildlife Fund Canada, paints a bleak picture for wildlife in a country that is home to a quarter of the earth’s wetlands, 8,500 rivers and more than 2m freshwater lakes.   During the past four decades, human activity – whether industrial development, farming, forestry or the expansion of urban areas – as well as climate change, pollution and overfishing have helped shrink the populations of 451 species, representing half of the 903 monitored species in the country. “I think for many Canadians, it’s somewhat of a surprise,” said James Snider of WWF Canada and the lead author of the report. “Canada is this vast nation with huge wilderness areas, at times we assume that wildlife here is doing OK.” The list of species in decline ranges from the woodland caribou, who grace the country’s 25¢ coin but have seen their habitat shrink from logging, mining and gas development, to the several species of whale that live off Canada’s three coasts. The report found that for species with diminishing populations, the average loss was 83% of their population. “That’s a really striking number,” said Snider. The report – billed by the conservation group as the most comprehensive synthesis of Canadian wildlife population trends to date – was compiled using more than 400 sources of data on species population. Scientists looked at more than 3,700 populations of vertebrates, including 106 specials of mammals, hundreds of fish and bird species and dozens of 46 amphibians and reptiles, during a period that stretched from 1970 to 2014. Wide gaps remain in regions such as the Arctic, where a lack of historical information prevented researchers from drawing conclusive results. It’s a critical omission, said Snider. “Climate change is being witnessed in the Arctic at a rate really not seen elsewhere in the world. We need to be effectively monitoring today the status of wildlife populations so that we can understand the impacts of climate change on a lot of really unique and important species in the Canadian north.” Of the 903 monitored species – representing about half of the known vertebrates in Canada – 407 species showed an increase in population, while 45 remained stable.  Success stories included the once struggling raptors – such as Cooper’s hawks and peregrine falcons – whose species have seen their numbers swell an average of 88% in recent decades, thanks to the reduced use and outright bans of pesticides such as DDT. Their rebound hints at the turnaround that is possible, said Snider. “So when we as society decide to take action and elevate the concern of wildlife, we are able to make real change.”  Researchers, however, found that federal legislation – one of the country’s primary tools aimed at protecting wildlife at risk – had failed to stem the decline of many species. The report looked at 64 species protected by federal legislation and found their populations diminished by an average of 2.7% per year since 2002, when federal legislation was adopted to protect species at risk, as compared to an annual decline of 1.7% between 1970 and 2002.  “According to researchers, the federal Species at Risk Act (Sara) has faltered in its mission to protect Canada’s most beleaguered wildlife,” the report noted. A number of peer-reviewed journal articles have documented shortcomings in the federal government’s efforts to curb the loss of wildlife, from delays in recognising critical habitat to the years-long process of creating recovery strategies.  Snider pointed to the beluga whale population in the St Lawrence estuary off Quebec as a potent example of these issues. After the population was listed as threatened in 2005, the creation of a recovery strategy dragged on for seven years.  It took until 2016 for the beluga’s habitat to be legally protected – more than a decade after the species was initially listed as threatened. The delays were not without consequence, as this year saw the status of the St Lawrence beluga upgraded to endangered. “This is a clear message that we need to be doing more to prevent the decline of wildlife,” said Snider. “If the rate of decline of wildlife continues as it is today, I do think we face the risk of beginning to lose species from Canada.”"
"It had been 12 years, since Katrina, that an Atlantic hurricane of this strength had made landfall on the American mainland. On 17 August, meteorologists were watching storm formations in the Atlantic. They named one Potential Tropical Cyclone 9. Later that night, they renamed it Tropical Storm Harvey. For the next week, the storm was downgraded to a Tropical Wave, then upgraded to a Tropical Depression. But as it closed in on the coast of Texas, fuelled by warm Gulf of Mexico waters, it grew stronger and was headed for the coast of Texas.  Americans were rattled and sickened by the Charlottesville rallies of 11 and 12 August, and the death of Heather Heyer when a young man ploughed his car into a crowd of counter-demonstrators. The country spent the following week in shock, badly needing moral leadership and calm. In response, Donald Trump praised the white supremacists as “very fine people”, and cast shared blame for the violence on the anti-fascists who had gathered to confront the neo-Nazis. On 16 August, as Harvey lumbered across the Gulf, Trump announced that he would hold a rally in downtown Phoenix on 22 August. The assumption was that he would use the opportunity to pardon former sheriff Joe Arpaio, who had been found guilty of contempt of court for defying a judge’s order to cease racial profiling. Doug Stanton, the mayor of Phoenix, begged Trump to reconsider the rally. “America is hurting,” he wrote in an op-ed. “And it is hurting largely because Trump has doused racial tensions with gasoline. With his planned visit to Phoenix on Tuesday, I fear the president may be looking to light a match.” As the coast of Texas prepared for the worst storm in a decade, Trump flew to Phoenix, where about 15,000 supporters and an equal number of protesters gathered. I was there, and watched as the police did their best to control the crowds, even while anti-fascists known as the John Brown Gun Club moved through the throng carrying loaded AR-15s and handguns. The night ended with teargas. For an hour, those of us in the crowd saw what Phoenix would look like in a war or under martial law. Miraculously, there were no deaths or serious injuries. Meanwhile, Americans living on the Gulf Coast made plans. Many areas were under mandatory evacuation orders. Those choosing to stay bought food and water, boarded up their windows and filled sandbags. On 24 August, the storm was upgraded to a category 2 hurricane named Harvey. Within a day, it had been upgraded to a category 4, with winds at 125mph. It was headed for Houston, the fourth-largest US city, with a population of 2.3 million. Forecasters called the storm life-threatening, and predicted that it could swamp cities as far as 100 miles inland. Once it made landfall, they said, it would stall, and drench cities with days of rain. Ocean storm surges were expected to be between 10 and 15ft high. Harvey struck first near Corpus Christi on 25 August and then, for the next two days, paused over Houston, deluging the area with 52 inches of rain. Reservoirs overflowed and coastal highways were subsumed by the sea. Almost 30% of Harris County – which included Houston and covers 1,800 square miles – was flooded. Twenty-seven trillion gallons of water saturated affected areas of Texas and Louisiana. A 60-year-old Houston police sergeant, Steve Perez, was driving to work when he was trapped by high waters and drowned in his car. Beaumont police found a three-year-old, alive and holding on to the body of her drowned mother, Colette Sulcer, 41. Sulcer had tried to carry her daughter to safety when she was drowned in a rain-swollen canal. Four men died after setting out on a small metal boat to help neighbours. Their boat struck a power line and all four men were killed. In all, at least 75 people died in the US as a result of Hurricane Harvey. The death toll was considered miraculously low, given almost 2,000 lost their lives to Katrina. On Friday, as the storm savaged Houston, Trump announced the pardon of Arpaio and pushed further on his plan to exclude transgender soldiers from the military. On Sunday, he tweeted about an upcoming appearance in Missouri which, he said, he “won by a lot in ’16,” and recommended a book written by a former campaign supporter. In response, John Lopez, a Houston sports radio host, tweeted, “My city is underwater. People losing everything. Unrelenting storm. Medical/1st responders on NO sleep. Thanks for book recommendation, tho.” In the wake of the storm, there was talk of climate change and its effect on the frequency and severity of storms in the Gulf. In 2015, scientists James Elsner and Nam-Young Kang published a study in the journal Nature Climate Change which found that warming waters in the Gulf of Mexico were making regional storms stronger. “We’re seeing fewer hurricanes,” Elsner said, “but the ones we do see are more intense. When one comes, all hell can break loose.” After five days of rain and chaos, the sun appeared over Houston on 30 August. The same day, a storm was developing near the Cape Verde Islands, after leaving the coast of West Africa. By 4 September the storm would develop into a category 5 hurricane, headed directly for the Caribbean islands and Florida. “If this isn’t climate change,” Miami mayor Tomás Regalado said as the storm approached, “I don’t know what is.” As the storm bore down on Florida, Trump tweeted his excitement about its scale: “Hurricane Irma is of epic proportion, perhaps bigger than we have ever seen.” In another tweet, he wrote, “Hurricane looks like largest ever recorded in the Atlantic!” Irma thrashed the Caribbean islands and flattened much of the Florida Keys. Damage was estimated to be at least $60bn. Sixty-nine people died. After the storm, reporters asked Trump if the two hurricanes made him rethink his opinion on climate change. “We’ve had bigger storms than this,” he said. Last Sunday, as Florida and Texas and Louisiana began to pick up the pieces, as funerals were held across the region and tens of thousands were struggling without electricity and clean water, when families were still living in shelters, the storms and their consequences were seemingly far from Trump’s mind. That Sunday, he retweeted a gif showing him hitting a golf ball and knocking over Hillary Clinton. • Dave Eggers is the author of Heroes Of The Frontier Commenting on this piece?

"We can’t stop looking at human faces. Can’t stop being interested in ourselves, our species. The BP Portrait Award, whose annual exhibition of winners and strong contenders can be seen at the National Portrait Gallery until 24 September, is full of humanity. It is, perhaps, the most humanist art prize in the world, an art award that specifically celebrates the painted human image and looks for modern heirs to the profoundly compassionate tradition of portraiture that includes Rembrandt, Velázquez and Lucian Freud.  Yet it may be time to get over ourselves. Has the moment come to put nature before portraiture, and abolish this oil-tainted oil painting prize?  Protests against BP, probably the world’s most reviled oil company since the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010, are regularly staged outside its annual prize giving ceremony. Now the pressure is being ramped up a notch.  For the first time, the Guardian has learned, a winning artist is rejecting part of BP’s prize money. Henry Christian-Slane, 26, from New Zealand, won this year’s BP young artist award, one of five prizes in the open submission contest. He’s donating £1,000 of the £7,000 he received to Greenpeace, to support “projects that aim to protest BPs further extraction of fossil fuels from the Earth”. Christian-Slane is not calling for the end of this art prize – that would be a bit hypocritical, having entered it – yet his gesture undoubtedly turns a harsh spotlight on the BP Portrait Award’s oil funding at a time when BP arts patronage is under attack. Tate’s relationship with the oil and gas extractor has ended (for non-climate related reasons, insists BP) and some say the writing could be on the wall for other arts organisations accepting its sponsorship.  I should probably declare an interest. I accepted an invitation to be on the BP Portrait Award jury a few years ago . I did not get paid anything, but I did have a nice dinner and happily sat on the judging panel of six with a voting BP representative. Since our arguments got quite heated, her vote mattered. It is sometimes argued that BP arts sponsorship is a fake publicity stunt that museums can easily do without – after a long relationship with Tate it turned out BP’s annual spend across its galleries averaged less than £250,000 – but if that is the rule, the BP Portrait Award may well be an exception. It isn’t so much the money – no doubt that is peanuts for BP – as the quirkiness and originality of this particular prize that makes the oil company’s involvement look almost – I hate to say this – idealistic.  Painted portraiture is, after all, not exactly a fashionable art form. None of the people who enter this prize are ever likely to be shortlisted for the more stylish Turner – I’ve judged that too and can attest that the chances of a portraitist winning it are close to zero.  Painting people well is hard, and in the cooler regions of the art world, unrewarding – yet in spite of that, so much of the truly great art of our time, such as Freud’s portraits of Leigh Bowery and Sue Tilley, has come from cussed sods who do it anyway. Freud worked all his life to get that good. I can’t help being grateful to BP for giving a bit of its dosh to Christian-Slane for his sensitive and promising painting Gabi. It is young painters like him who may become the Freuds of the future – and frankly they do not get much encouragement or fame outside this art prize. Then again, how much do portraits matter? How much does art itself matter? I think the debate about BP sponsorship of the arts is dishonest if it does not ask these bigger questions. It’s all very well bullying art galleries – that are struggling, not just to survive in a harsh economic climate but to stay free as the British public expects – to divest themselves of BP support.  The reality is that if we’re making it harder for the arts, we should be prepared to say some things matter more than art. And they do. One of the Greenpeace campaigns that will benefit from Christian-Slane’s cash is its effort to save a newly discovered coral reef at the mouth of the Amazon. This 600 mile reef, which was a kind of scientific legend, an oceanographic rumour, was proven to exist by Greenpeace itself in 2016. The images taken from its submersible are wonderlands of colour and abundance – a beauty no artist created.  This is, however, a beauty that humans can easily destroy. And guess what: BP is one of the oil companies targeting the area. It says it “expects to begin exploratory drilling operations before August 2018”. It claims that its operation about 22 miles from the magical corals and their denizens will be completely safe. Uh-huh. Looking at the wonder of this unique reef – it exists in exactly the kind of murky waters that are not meant to support corals – it is impossible for me to claim a painting matters as much. As the great, campaigning Victorian art critic John Ruskin pointed out, human art can never hope to match the grandeur of nature. The sky is brighter than any painting, the sea – as we can observe in images of this reef – more mysterious than any human fantasy. Without nature there can be no art. It is blind and narrow for arts organisations to pretend they are outside the struggle to save nature.  So make this a turning point. A young artist has bitten the oily hand that feeds the BP Portrait Award and he’s surely started something. If artists don’t want BP’s money how can the National Portrait Gallery keep offering it? Tellingly, the first sponsor of this prize was the John Player and Sons tobacco company.  It seems it’s always the controversial businesses that spend on the arts – the saintly ones don’t crave the publicity. Today it would be unimaginable for museums to take tobacco money. Perhaps museums need to find the next sponsors who need to clean up a dodgy image – soft drinks giants, maybe? It is not true that you can cut off a source of money to museums without harming art. Without BP there might be no portrait award. So let’s tell it truthfully: in the interest of the planet, art will just have to lose face."
"For Rob Vertessy, the attacks on his government agency became tedious and time-consuming and no less irritating because they were coming from a motivated group of “amateurs”. Vertessy spent a decade at Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology. He retired in April 2016 after five years as the agency’s director.   Over that time, Vertessy’s agency was under consistent attack from climate science denialists who would claim, often through the news and opinion pages of the Australian, that the weather bureau was deliberately manipulating its climate records to make recent warming seem worse than it really was. “From my perspective, people like this, running interference on the national weather agency, are unproductive and it’s actually dangerous,” Vertessy told me. “Every minute a BoM executive spends on this nonsense is a minute lost to managing risk and protecting the community. It is a real problem.” Now, the agency is under another wave of attack through the pages of the Rupert Murdoch-owned broadsheet, which is publishing claims made by Jennifer Marohasy, of the “free market” conservative thinktank the Institute of Public Affairs.  Earlier this week, the former Abbott government adviser and climate science denier Maurice Newman accused the bureau of “fabricating temperature records” that represented a “smoking gun that threatens the integrity of global temperature records”. As rhetorical overreach goes, Newman has form. “The scientific delusion, the religion behind the climate crusade, is crumbling,” Newman has written.  The current non-story centres on two of the bureau’s 695 automatic weather stations (AWS). As temperatures reached -10.4C in Thredbo and Goulburn in July, a hardware card in the AWS stopped working. This event, detected by the bureau, kick-started several internal quality control processes. The bureau found four other hardware cards in areas where things can get chilly and replaced them. The cards should not have been used, as they could become faulty at low temperatures.  That’s essentially it. But the Australian and the IPA and the network of climate science denial blogs have once again screamed scandal. In an interview with shock jock Alan Jones, who thinks climate science is “witchcraft”, Marohasy claimed the bureau had “reached a new low”. Jones called for people to be sacked.  A report was also commissioned by the environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, with three external independent reviewers joining bureau staff.  Was this really a scandal? A smoking gun? No.  The review found the incident, if we can even grant it that status, had “no direct or indirect” impact on the bureau’s long-term climate dataset (known as ACORN-SAT). The bureau’s procedures worked and its data quality control processes were “of a high standard”, the review found.  “The Australian people have been well served by the bureau and can continue to rely on the excellent services it provides,” Frydenberg said. Much of the current noise is like deja vu for Vertessy, who is now a part-time professor at the University of Melbourne’s school of engineering. “I was exposed to a lot of it and it took up a lot of my time that’s for sure,” he says. “I feel for my successor and the team at the bureau having to constantly devote energy to this. It’s really quite debilitating. “Time and time again there has been one independent review by experts after another, all telling the same story. The simple, unimpeachable facts are that the BoM is doing an exemplary job at managing the nation’s climate data and multiple independent reviews have confirmed that and we are recognised by our World Meteorological Organisation peers as being amongst the best in the world; that keeps being restated and restated.  “I think the Australian play on very dangerous ground here,” he says, adding that some editors at the newspaper were guilty of “perpetuating nonsense”. “For a newspaper that has a strapline that reads ‘for the informed Australian’ they really should refocus on talking to people that know something about the topic, instead of perpetuating this bizarre myth that the BoM are fraudsters [or] conspirators.” Vertessy says staff inside the bureau are well aware of the concerted attempts to attack their work. “They understand that there is an organised climate denial network and that it has a fever swamp that communicates amongst itself and occasionally tries to enter the national debate through the agency of leading newspapers and the like,” he says.  “That’s very well understood, because it is very well documented. It remains hurtful and creates anxiety among the technical specialists involved in this but those people do the right thing and buckle down. They are a great bunch of people.”  In 2009, the bureau’s then most senior climatologist, Dr Michael Coughlan, told me that the agency had stopped responding to claims being pushed in the Australian newspaper. “The Australian clearly has an editorial policy,” he said. “No matter how many times the scientific community refutes these arguments, they persist in putting them out – to the point where we believe there’s little to be gained in the use of our time in responding.’’  So how should the agency respond when it comes under attack?  Vertessy says: “It has perplexed us all over the years about the extent to which we should or shouldn’t engage in the so-called ‘ping pong’ of this stuff. I think Mike’s commentary remains largely intact.  “We see limited gains in arguing with a newspaper that has got a rusted on view about these matters and is not open to reasoned debate.” He says that, instead, the bureau’s staff put their energies into “continual improvement” of their methods. Vertessy says that, while he considers the current wave of attacks “a tremendous waste” of the government’s time, he has sympathy for ministers. “When something makes front-page news in a national newspaper, it requires a political response and I think over the years the government has done a pretty good job in sticking with the bureau and independent experts in examining these matters rationally and reporting on them and communicate them transparently to the public.” He says that, during his own tenure, the government has consistently supported the bureau because it trusts its experts. “I’m not saying they would not be concerned about the claims that are made but, at the end of the day, they have a reasonable level of trust and certainly supported me through my time and I never felt under siege by the government. But I felt under siege by the Australian and the IPA.” He says the constant attacks have also changed the way the bureau interacts with the media on climate change. “The BoM provides amazing access for the media to its people but, on climate change, we have had to implement stricter protocols about who is authorised to talk and how. I implemented a lot of that stuff, quite frankly, because the minute you are entering the polity of the country in the debate, as are senior bureaucrats, you have to treat it carefully and look at it as a risk and manage it accordingly.  “If someone says the wrong thing then it’s likely to be amplified one hundred times fold into something that looks like a scandal, when it is anything but.”  So when a shock jock or a thinktank employee claims the bureau is trying to cook the books, how should the public react?  What needs to be front of mind, Vertessy says, is that there is “virtually complete consensus on the extent to which the planet has warmed and why, since the beginning of the industrial revolution”. “The facts are just unequivocal because they have been replicated so many times, by so many teams, using multiple independent methods.” He says if the bureau “was really making a hash of managing its climate data” then it would be documented in scientific “journals and at symposia” but “that’s clearly not happening”. He says it “beggars belief” that these commentators “actually profess to know better”.  “They simply don’t,” he says. “Think about the big picture and don’t get lost in the smokescreen that’s created by people who are trying to undermine the science. “The data absolutely confirms that we have already seen consequences from climate change, certainly in the way the climate system is behaving. There’s just zero doubt about it any more.  “Looking into the future is of course more fraught, but that strongly suggests that we are on a very dangerous trajectory.” He says while making predictions of the future clearly comes with uncertainties, the planet is on “a very dangerous trajectory”. “We know plenty enough to say that unless there is corrective action in the amount of emissions – very significant corrective action I might add – then we will enter increasingly dangerous times that will be very costly throughout the world to life, food security, water security and to the economic damage wrought by severe like we have seen in the United States in the last few days.  “So I have to admit that I am something of a climate pessimist because I worry about the trajectory that we are on.  “But, as the costs of climate change accumulate in the years ahead, I can see that leaders of this climate change denial movement will really be seen as culpable.”"
"  A cache of decaying notebooks found in a crumbling Congo research station has provided unexpected evidence with which to help solve a crucial puzzle – predicting how vegetation will respond to climate change.  The treasure trove of tree growth data dating from the 1930s was found by the biologist Koen Hufkens in a tumbledown building at the Yangambi Biological Station, which was once Africa’s leading forest and agriculture research institution. Combined with other records, the recovered data allows Hufkens to make improved predictions about the health of the forest. Hufkens, of Ghent University in Belgium, began researching the Congo Basin about five years ago. He had planned to install a high tech monitoring station known as a carbon flux tower in Yangambi. The instruments are indispensable for observing the way plant life responds to climate change and have become standard gear for studying forests in North America and Europe, as well as a handful of locations in the Amazon Jungles such as the Congo forest play a critical part in controlling the rate of global warming; vegetation sucks up about 25% of the carbon dioxide we spew out of our tailpipes and smokestacks. Scientists believe much of this CO2 ends up stored in the trunks of tropical trees, with the Congo’s trees sequestering 250bn tonnes alone. But research shows the tropical carbon sink is faltering. This means CO2 will build up faster in the atmosphere and temperatures will rise more quickly.  Scientists are working to understand better how tropical forests respond to shifts in rainfall. The Congo forest, second only to the Amazon in size, is particularly hard to study. Poor infrastructure, unstable governments and civil war have hindered systematic research. But understanding the Congo is important – it appears to be drying out, and it is hard to say how it will behave in a drier climate. Hufkens was hired by a research team to install the first tower in the Congo Basin, but the project soon ran out of funds. Undaunted, Hufkens looked for other ways to examine how the forest responds to changes in rainfall. A colleague mentioned the neglected notebooks from the middle of the last century, still on the shelf in Yangambi’s herbarium. In 2013, Hufkens flew to Yangambi and made copies of the old notebooks and annual summaries. He arrived just in time. The herbarium’s roof was caving in and the documents were already exposed to incessant rains, leaving them water-stained. Rodents had gnawed on some of them.  But Hufkens was delighted. The collection contained weekly observations of 2,000 trees between 1937 and 1958. Technicians had meticulously noted when trees flowered, fruited, dropped fruit and lost leaves.  The archive was a treasure, but there was a serious problem. The hand-written notations could not easily be digitised for statistical analysis. Up to 100,000 observations needed to be transcribed tediously into a spreadsheet. Hufkens estimated it would take him a full year, more time than he had for the work.  In 2015 Hufkens stumbled across Zooniverse, a website for enlisting online volunteers to help scientists perform the necessary but tedious tasks that research often requires. Through the site, 1.5 million volunteers have helped classify galaxies, transcribe old ship logs and identify individual whales by their flukes.  Hufkens digitally sliced up the scans he had made in Yangambi into thousands of matchbook-size photos, each containing a year’s information from a single tree. Volunteers on the site examined one photo at a time. In a matter of seconds they could transcribe the visual information into a form that could later be assembled into a complete data set. About 8,000 volunteers worked an average of 90 seconds per visit, perhaps on the bus to work or during TV commercials.  Altogether the anonymous helpers contributed the equivalent of three years of full-time work. Hufkens had each image processed 10 times, by 10 distinct volunteers. They had multiplied the effort required, but reduced the error rate to near zero.  After just over a year, the virtual team finished processing the huge collection last March and Hufkens is now correlating tree behaviour with Yangambi’s weather records.  The European Union has recently authorised a grant to finally erect the longed-for flux tower at Yangambi, but it will take years for researchers to gather enough data to draw any conclusions. By relying on the kindness of strangers, however, Hufkens is already a long way toward predicting the Congo forest’s future."
"Like the debate over gun control, the public discussion in the US about whether to take action on the climate has often been characterised as a struggle between powerful lobbies and violent reality. After each campus shooting or hurricane disaster, there is a brief uptick of concern followed by a gradual return to entrenched positions as the National Rifle Association or the oil industry reassert their influence, inevitably raising the question: just how bad do things have to get to reach a tipping point?  Fortunately, such parallels go only so far. The past few days have shown not only that the scale of catastrophe is getting worse, but the price of a solution is getting cheaper. The apocalyptic devastation wreaked by hurricanes Irma and Harvey is clearly in line with scientific predictions that a warming world will come with an immense humanitarian and financial toll. In the US alone, the cost of the damage caused by the two hurricanes is estimated at $290bn – or 1.5% of GDP. The toll in the worst-hit Caribbean islands has not yet been calculated but it will be far greater relative to the size of the battered economies. But while the problem has never looked grimmer, the most likely solution – a switch from fossil fuels to renewable energy – has rarely looked as desirable or financially feasible as it does now. Yesterday brought news from the UK that offshore wind prices have fallen by half in the past two years and are now – for the first time – lower than nuclear and gas. This is an exciting breakthrough, perhaps the biggest ever for the renewable industry in Britain. It is no longer just academics and campaigners pushing clean energy for scientific and idealistic reasons. Now the market has bought into the hard-headed business case – and ahead of time. The speed of this transformation has stunned industry observers and delighted climate campaigners, who see it as part of a faster, and cheaper, worldwide takeup of wind and solar power than was forecast . Technology needs to advance further for this revolution to maintain momentum. The fossil fuel and nuclear industries are increasingly struggling to compete in terms of cost but they argue they are a more stable supplier of electricity when there is no wind and no sun. But that does not have to be the case. It can change if the government and business sector do more to develop and promote battery technology so that solar and wind energy can be stored and distributed at night and between breezes. There are already promising steps forward. Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, has grabbed most of the headlines with his attempt to build the world’s biggest lithium battery to support the grid in Australia, expanding the range of electric cars and enabling solar homes to spread energy use across the day. But he has many rivals. China and Germany are investing billions of dollars in this game-changing field. In Spain, one company – Acciona – is already combining batteries with turbines to extend the duration of wind supply. In the deserts of Chile, a giant solar plant uses locally mined salt as a store of thermal energy. Elsewhere power companies are experimenting with silicon and graphite – which may one day provide abundant alternatives to scarce lithium. Even the British government – which has cut subsidies for renewable energy – has bought into the argument for better batteries and smart meters to smooth out the peaks and troughs in electricity supply and demand. In July it announced plants to create a national battery institute as part of a £264m funding pledge for research into the field – all of which will erode the need for fossil fuels as the devastating long-term costs of oil, gas and coal become more apparent and publicly challenged. Lawsuits have already been filed against ExxonMobil, Chevron and BP for rising sea levels, with some scientists claiming these three companies alone are responsible for 6% of sea level rise. The hurricanes and wildfires in the US – like the floods, droughts and extreme temperatures that have struck India, Bangladesh, Chile, Peru and many other countries over the past year – are a reminder that the transformation cannot come quickly enough. Donald Trump may be trying to slow or reverse this process, but the events of the past few days have underlined there is enormous positive momentum, a strong business case and increasing risks from inaction. A key thing now will be public opinion in the US. The powerful oil lobby has rarely had such a strong presence in the White House. But the past few weeks ought to make a difference. The scientific debate is long since over, the business case is now clear, and the humanitarian consequences have never been more apparent. But without political change, the tipping point is more likely to be towards expensive disasters than cheap energy. • Jonathan Watts is the Guardian’s global environment editor"
"One week after the record deluge in Texas, the biggest hurricane ever measured in the mid-Atlantic is tearing through the Caribbean. Hurricane Irma, a category-five storm, is destroying homes and threatening lives in the Leeward Islands with 185mph winds and 11ft coastal surges, and in the coming days it is forecast to hit Puerto Rico, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Cuba and Florida. The governor of Florida has already declared a state of emergency. For Donald Trump, these twin megastorms are a source of awe. “Hurricane looks like largest ever recorded in the Atlantic!” he tweeted of Irma on Wednesday. “Even experts have said they’ve never seen one like this!” he posted of Harvey last week. But for many scientists they are a worrying sign of a “new normal” in which extreme weather events become more intense as a result of manmade climate change. Rather than expressing astonishment, they say policymakers need to strengthen long-term countermeasures and act more effectively on reducing carbon emissions. Hurricane looks like largest ever recorded in the Atlantic! “Even I as a climate scientist am startled to see another potentially devastating storm in this region so shortly after Harvey,” said Anders Levermann, of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. “Unfortunately, the physics are very clear: hurricanes get their destructive energy from ocean heat, and currently water surface temperatures in this region are very high.” Climatologists are careful to point out that rising greenhouse gas emissions are not the sole cause of hurricanes, which buffet the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico around this time every year. But there is strong evidence that warming temperatures and rising sea levels are increasing the destructive power of storms. “Higher than average sea-surface temperatures are fuelling Hurricane Irma, giving additional energy and moisture,” said Julian Heming, a hurricane expert at the Met Office. He said the impacts – intense rainfall, flash floods, extreme winds and a potentially lethal storm surge – would be felt far from the centre as Irma moves north-west. On Saint Barthélemy, Irma’s winds were measured at more than 150mph before they destroyed monitoring equipment in the island’s meteorological station. The US National Hurricane Center has said the “potentially catastrophic” storm could bring surges of up to 20ft along coasts in the southern Bahamas and Turks and Caicos Islands, and between five and 12 inches of rain in Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, Haiti and Cuba. Whether Irma will reach Florida at its current level of intensity is uncertain. Since records began in 1851, only three category five hurricanes have made landfall in the US. Following Harvey, which was a category four hurricane at its peak, a second major storm of this size in one season would be unprecedented, according to Weather Underground. But historically unusual weather is no longer freakish. The floods that hit Houston last week were described as a once-in-500-years event because records suggested there was only a 0.2% chance of such heavy rainfall. However, precedent is an increasingly unreliable guide in a changing climate. In the past three years, Texas has been hit by three 100- to 500-year events, according to local media. More could follow. The National Hurricane Center said on Wednesday it expected Tropical Storm Jose, which has formed east of the Antilles, to become a hurricane during the night. Its latest map also shows a third, smaller storm – Katia – in the Gulf of Mexico. The degree to which climate change affects the intensity of these weather events is being studied. But there is a growing sense of urgency for governments to reduce emissions and strengthen preparations for future disasters.  “These events offer wider lessons on how prepared we are for a warmer future. It is likely that rainfall events, in general, will become more extreme, as will heatwaves and droughts. So events like Irma and Harvey also help us understand if we are prepared for them and who will be most affected,” said Dann Mitchell, a research fellow at the University of Bristol’s Cabot Institute.  As well as better urban and emergency planning, he said, social policies would also play a part. “Increasingly, the evidence is clear that the poorest, being the most exposed to many climate risks and often being the least protected, will be most affected. Addressing this inequality is at the heart of not just the climate change discussion but all discussions about how we become resilient to risk and hazards.”"
"Australian states and territories are powering ahead, developing policies that will meet the federal government’s internationally agreed greenhouse gas emission targets, with South Australia, the ACT and Tasmania leading the race. Despite being chastised by the federal government for unilateral action, South Australia is leading the race, with the ACT and Tasmania not far behind, according to a report by the Climate Council. Compared on a series of measures including penetration of renewable energy, the percentage of households with solar, as well as emissions and renewable energy targets, the Northern Territory, Western Australia and New South Wales are at the back of the pack, with Victoria and Queensland in the middle. Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions have been rising ever since the Coalition government repealed the carbon tax in 2014. The federal government’s own projections show their policies will cause emissions to continue to rise for decades to come. But in the midst of the ongoing federal policy vacuum, every state and territory besides Western Australia has “gone it alone” and developed strong renewable energy and emissions reduction policies. South Australia leads the country with 47% of its electricity sourced from renewable sources, followed by the ACT at 22%. Tasmania sourced 92% of its electricity from renewable sources, but that was dominated by large-scale hydro electricity. The Northern Territory sourced just 2% of its electricity from renewable sources, sitting behind Western Australia and Queensland at 7%. Victoria sourced 12% from renewables while NSW sat at 17%. Queensland led the country when it comes to solar households, with 32% of homes having solar panels. That just pipped South Australia, which had 31%. While both Western Australia and the Northern Territory scored poorly on most measures, there appeared to be grassroots momentum there for solar rooftops, with the biggest increases in solar penetration over the past year happening in those states. Western Australia jumped almost three percentage points to more than 25% penetration, and the Northern Territory jumped 2.7 percentage points to 11.4% – a figure that was still the lowest in the country. The ACT and Tasmania had the strongest renewable energy targets, with the former aiming to implement a 100% target by 2020 and the latter by 2022. The ACT’s aggressive and bipartisan renewable energy policies delivered the lowest energy costs in the country for consumers. Every state except Western Australia and the Northern Territory had targets to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050. Those policies, combined with a surge in grassroots activity and market-driven closure of coal power plants, look set to easily cut Australia’s emissions by more 28% below 2005 levels, as Australia committed to following the Paris Agreement in 2015. That was the conclusion of a report by Frontier Economics earlier in the year, which concluded: “The commonwealth government will receive credit for state renewable policies that contribute to meeting the 2030 emissions target, while admonishing them for any energy security issues that may result. “Every state and territory, with the exception of Western Australia, is taking energy and climate policy into their own hands, with strong renewable energy targets or net zero emissions targets in place,” said Climate Council councillor and energy expert Andrew Stock. “States and territories previously lagging (NT, NSW and WA), are now stepping up the pace, joining the enormous progress we’re seeing across the nation,” he said. Climate Council member and former president of BP Australasia, Greg Bourne, said Australians are embracing solar energy in droves, with more than 5.6GW generated on the rooftops of 1.7 million homes. “Australia is one of the sunniest countries in the world, so it’s no surprise we’ve already rolled out enough solar to power the lights at the MCG every day for 20,000 years,” he said. States leading the way without federal coordination was described as a “a messy dog’s breakfast” by the Grattan Institute’s Tony Wood, who went on to say the unilateral state action was “understandable with federal ­climate change inaction”."
"In a manner reminiscent of Stephen King’s Bazaar of Bad Dreams, dark clouds of despair and destruction hover yet again over the Caribbean with the passage of Hurricane Maria. The most recent version of our recurring ecological nightmare included Hurricane Harvey followed by Hurricane Irma, the latter setting a new record of three consecutive days as a category 5 storm with maximum wind speeds of 185mph, and leaving a trail of devastation British foreign secretary Boris Johnson described as “absolutely hellish”.  Maria’s full fury is yet to be revealed but social media posts from Dominica’s prime minister, Roosevelt Skerrit, and acting high commissioner for Dominica to the UK, Janet Charles, early on Tuesday morning described the destruction, the latter posting on Facebook: “Dominica has been brutalised by the hurricane. Please let the world know. We need help!” Communications with Dominica have since been lost. The London-based high commissions from the Caribbean, while outside the hurricane’s path, are not immune from its wrath. We’re currently contacting loved ones at home, planning yet another round of appeals for assistance, and continuing our prayers for protection from the ravages of this cycle of bad weather and failing that, the strength to resist until the close of the Atlantic hurricane season at the end of November. The Caribbean now finds itself fighting on two fronts. First, against nature’s fury, second, against public opinion that questions whether the hurricane-ravaged islands are deserving of international aid. Britain’s call for urgent changes to international rules on aid to allow UK development assistance budgets to be used to help victims of these hurricanes has unbelievably been met with resistance. Many in the Caribbean share Theresa May’s frustration with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) development assistance committee (DAC) rules that exclude countries such as St Kitts and Nevis and British Overseas Territories including Anguilla, British Virgin Islands and Turks and Caicos from receiving much-needed official development assistance from international aid budgets. However, the response to the UK’s call for an update to these rules established 40 years ago has been disheartening. The prevailing view of the international donor community is that the gross national income per capita of these islands is too high for them to have access to aid budgets designed to relieve poverty, a perspective shared by the international NGO community. As people in hurricane-struck islands struggle to find any kind of footing, the international development charity Christian Aid argued: “The [UK] overseas aid budget is quite rightly subject to serious scrutiny and a set of rules which ringfence overseas aid spending to ensure it goes to the poorest people in the poorest countries. Overseas Territories are not among the world’s poorest countries. In fact, the British Virgin Islands, a tax haven, has a higher GDP per capita than the UK.” The statement concluded with the stony suggestion that: “The companies and investors that use tax havens like some of the British Overseas Territories, all have a role to play in rebuilding those communities.” This perspective is premised on two misconceptions. First, the egregious notion that “tax havens” exist in the Caribbean. While the Caribbean contains low tax jurisdictions, they form part of a wider strategy to diversify Caribbean economies. Moreover, the development of international business and financial centres mirrors the practice of many developed countries as shown by a report published by Oxfam last December, in which Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands are ranked among the world’s 10 lowest-tax jurisdictions. The second fallacy is the limited way in which the deserving poor are identified. DAC rules restrict overseas aid to low- and middle-income countries based on GNI per capita as computed by the World Bank. This classification by economic data alone is both dated and myopic. It ignores the acute vulnerability of small countries, particularly those island states in the Caribbean and Pacific vulnerable to catastrophic storms. For over four decades, the Commonwealth of Nations, the recognised champion of small states in terms of policy research and global advocacy, has demonstrated that small states face a unique set of development challenges because of their size, limited range of products and exports, scarce financial resources and susceptibility to the impacts of climate change and natural disasters. Through the Commonwealth vulnerability index, the international donor community was offered an additional criterion to determine the classification of developing countries. This is yet to become a reality. In the blink of an eye, small islands states can be hurled from seeming prosperity to absolute poverty, lacking the basic human needs: water, food, clothing, shelter and sanitation. As Roosevelt Skerrit wrote following the passage of Hurricane Maria: “Initial reports are of widespread devastation. So far we have lost all what money can buy and replace. My greatest fear for the morning is that we will wake to news of serious physical injury and possible deaths as a result of likely landslides triggered by persistent rains … We will need help, my friends, we will need help of all kinds.” And ironically, although Antigua and Barbuda was pummelled by Irma, as it recently exceeded the DAC country income threshold, it may be deemed ineligible for official development assistance at this year’s review. Unlike those in the US threatened by Harvey, Irma and possibly Maria, there is nowhere to run to on Caribbean islands. And there is no pool of resources domestically to mobilise afterwards. As depicted in the media recently following Irma, it is almost like game over; nothing left but hardship and faith. And in the midst of the efforts to rebuild – for Caribbean people are formidable – the provision of essential needs is thwarted by DAC rules. It is not as if the OECD, the club of the world’s wealthiest countries, is being asked to set a precedent, for this has already been done by the European Union through the European Development Fund (EDF). In 2013, when the 11th EDF, the EU’s main instrument for providing development aid to African, Caribbean and Pacific countries and to overseas countries and territories, was concluded, the main modification was to ensure more flexibility and faster reactions in the case of unexpected events. A new shock-absorbing scheme was created to help countries to mitigate the short-term effects of exogenous shocks such as natural disasters. I hope that the UN and the Commonwealth will discuss the vulnerability of small island developing states in New York this week as the international community gathers for the United Nations general assembly, the Commonwealth foreign affairs ministers meeting and the UK-hosted pre-2018 Commonwealth summit reception. On Tuesday, as St Kitts and Nevis braces in anticipation of Hurricane Maria, it also marks its 34th anniversary of independence. We pray that it has cause for thanksgiving and, if it comes to the worst, that the Commonwealth will demonstrate duty of care and the international community will follow in doing what is right and just and come to its aid. Like every island ravaged by hurricane, it deserves it. • Guy Hewitt is Barbados high commissioner"
"Former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott is to give the annual lecture to a London-based climate sceptic group. Abbott will give his speech, entitled Daring to Doubt, to the London-based Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF) on 9 October.  The GWPF is led by former UK chancellor Nigel Lawson, who recently incorrectly told the BBC the global temperature had “slightly declined” in the past decade. The BBC was heavily criticised for allowing Lawson to make factually inaccurate assertions unchallenged. Abbott becomes the second former Australian prime minister to be hosted by the GWPF. In 2013, John Howard – Abbott’s old boss and political mentor – delivered the annual address. In his speech, called One Religion is Enough, Howard also incorrectly claimed global warming had stalled and expressed deep scepticism about the possibility of an international agreement on climate change. Two years later, the Paris climate treaty was struck. Under Abbott’s leadership, Australia became something of a pariah on the issue of climate change. His government was known for its pro-coal and anti-climate action policies. Abbott infamously referred to climate science as “bullshit” and said coal was “good for humanity”. The speech Abbott gives in London in October will be notable for its domestic political overtones.  Climate change is a hugely volatile political issue in Australia and Abbott has successfully used the issue in the past to neuter political rivals, including the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, who deposed Abbott in 2015."
"After Harvey, Irma and now Maria, I wonder how wild animals and birds manage in hurricanes? Do they “migrate” temporarily at the first signs of the impending storm or have other ways of surviving? Or do they simply perish in huge numbers? Jo Macdonald, Dorset  • Post your answers – and new questions – below or email them to nq@theguardian.com"
"Human-caused climate change amplified the damages and suffering associated with Hurricane Harvey in several different ways. First, sea level rise caused by global warming increased the storm surge and therefore the coastal inundation and flooding from the storm. Second, the warmer atmosphere holds more water vapor, which intensifies extreme precipitation events like the record-shattering rainfall associated with Harvey. Third, warmer ocean waters essentially act as hurricane fuel, which may have made Harvey more intense than it would otherwise have been. There are other possible human factors at play about which we have less certainty. For example, it’s possible that Harvey stalled off the coast of Texas because of changes in atmospheric circulation patterns associated with human-caused global warming. As climate scientist Michael Mann notes, his research has shown that these sorts of stationary summer weather patterns tend to happen more often in a hotter world, but we can’t yet say if that happened in Harvey’s case.  Other human activities also worsened Harvey’s impacts. For example, Houston suffers from urban sprawl, covering a larger area (nearly 600 square miles) than the cities of Chicago, San Francisco, Washington DC, Boston, Manhattan, and Santa Barbara combined. With urban sprawl and poor planning came expansive impervious surfaces – absorbent soil covered instead by concrete and asphalt, increasing flood risks. Houston’s lack of zoning laws combined with the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) also encouraged development in flood prone areas.  Private insurance companies don’t want to insure homes that face a significant risk of flooding, but with a lack of regulation and/or government insurance offered by NFIP, development in relatively high-risk flood areas can be profitable. That is, until a flood strikes. 85% of Houston homeowners don’t have flood insurance and will be unable to recover most of their losses from Hurricane Harvey. Others are covered by NFIP, which was already $24 billion in debt before Harvey. That’s because NFIP hasn’t been charging sufficiently high premiums, in large part because it has underestimated flood risks based on maps and projections that are sometimes decades out of date. And climate change is amplifying those flood risks. It’s a challenging problem because for homeowners living in areas where flood risks have significantly increased, flood insurance premiums should hypothetically increase significantly to cover those risks. But factors like rising sea levels and expanding urban sprawl that contribute to that increased risk aren’t the fault of the homeowners, who can then become angry constituents for politicians working on updating NFIP. And so needed changes to the program have yet to be made. As a result, the government is effectively subsidizing the costs associated with living in high-risk flood areas. Between 1978 and 2005, NFIP paid out $5.5 billion (9.6% of paid claims) to just 30,000 properties (0.6% of the total covered by flood insurance) that each flooded an average of five times. Because the NFIP premiums are too low, taxpayers end up footing billions of dollars of those payouts. The situation is analogous to climate change. Without a price on carbon pollution, industries and individuals can dump carbon in the atmosphere for free. But that carbon pollution has costs that we eventually pay, in the form of increased property damage due to amplified storms like Hurricane Harvey, for example. Or from higher food prices when farmers are struck by an intensified drought, or decreased worker productivity in heat waves, or valuable coastal property lost to encroaching sea levels, or homes lost to bigger wildfires and increased costs to fight them – the list of climate costs goes on and on.  Those costs are eventually paid by taxpayers, but we’re picking up the tab for the polluters. It’s effectively a subsidy for the fossil fuel industry to the tune of trillions of dollars every year, and as with artificially cheap flood insurance premiums, we’re subsidizing risky behavior that ultimately causes severe damages. Ten days before Hurricane Harvey hit, the Trump administration rolled back the Federal Flood Risk Mitigation Standard. The policy was implemented by the Obama administration, and required taxpayer-funded public infrastructure projects to plan for future flooding risks. Much infrastructure within and around Houston is now underwater, and accounting for future flooding risks when replacing it would be smart. But the Trump administration considered this policy a burdensome regulation, claiming that the infrastructure permitting process has too many “inefficiencies.” Apparently those “inefficiencies” include saving taxpayer money by reducing future flood losses. When asked about the causes and contributors to Hurricane Harvey and its damages, EPA administrator Scott Pruitt sidestepped the subject by using the Trump administration’s favorite strategy – attack the media: I think for opportunistic media to use events like this to, without basis or support, just to simply engage in a cause and effect type of discussion, and not focus upon the needs of people, I think is misplaced. Worse yet, EPA spokesperson Liz Bowman accused climate scientists of “engaging in attempts to politicize an ongoing tragedy.” It’s similar to the argument that we shouldn’t talk about gun control in the aftermath of a mass shooting. That’s precisely when we should be working on solutions to prevent these types of disasters from happening again and again. Those who oppose climate policies will often argue that we can simply adapt to the consequences of human-caused climate change. Most recently, New York Times columnist Bret Stephens suggested that Harvey will just be a “speed bump” for Houston’s economy, and that the world should follow Houston’s example of “environmental resilience” by following “the path of its extraordinary economic growth.” The people in Texas suffering from having lost their homes and possessions probably aren’t comforted that Stephens considers Harvey a “speed bump” for the local economy (which coincidentally is probably not true). As renowned glaciologist Lonnie Thompson put it: Global warming is here and is already affecting our climate, so prevention is no longer an option. Three options remain for dealing with the crisis: mitigate, adapt, and suffer. There will be some of each, but the more we mitigate the problem by cutting carbon pollution, the less we will have to adapt to and suffer from the consequences of climate change. However, even adaptation takes action. We can take some steps to adapt to rising sea levels, but denying the problem by rolling back regulations aimed at doing just that shifts us further toward the suffering part of the equation. Economic growth has many benefits, but by itself does not move us in the direction of climate mitigation or adaptation. In short, to minimize the suffering caused by climate change, we need to be smarter about addressing the problem and adapting its consequences. Right now we’re instead becoming stupider, and that will only lead to increased suffering. If we want to minimize the suffering caused by future Harveys, we need to talk about how climate change is making them worse, and we need to do something about it."
"On a very wet day we can expect 1-2 inches of rain to fall in the UK, perhaps double that in extreme conditions. But as Hurricane Harvey and other storms have shown, in warmer climes prolonged rainfall can be many times heavier. So in a warming world, just how heavy could rain become?

"It’s always hot in Bidyadanga but a few degrees can make a big difference in the remote Aboriginal community, about 190km south of Broome in Western Australia. “It’s always hot – it’s the desert – but the difference between 33C and 36C can be quite oppressive,” said Shaun Burgess, a teacher in the community.  This winter, it mattered more than most – 2017 was Australia’s warmest on record for average maximum temperatures, which reached nearly 2C above the winter average and beat the previous record set in 2009 by 0.3C, according to a report released by the Climate Council on Tuesday. In July alone 72 records were broken for the highest maximum temperature, including in Sydney, which set a record high of 26.5C. Bidyadanga was one of those 72; on July 27 it reached 36.3C, the hottest day in Australia’s warmest July. It also broke its previous July record of 35.7C, set in 2016. “It’s made it really difficult to do things like go camping or fishing with the students, which is something we’ve done a lot of in previous years,” Burgess said. “There’s been less of an opportunity to clear the mind, less of a reprieve, I guess.” And the reprieves may be becoming rarer. Australia has set new seasonal highs for maximum temperatures 10 times so far this century and the Climate Council report found that more than 260 heat and low rainfall records were broken between June and August this year. It was the fifth warmest winter on record for average temperatures, and the driest since 2002. Daytime temperature averages were above average for almost the entire country; more than 90% of Australia was in the highest 10% of historical observations. And as summer approaches, a third of the country is at above average risk from bushfire damage as a result of the hot, dry weather. “Winter warm spells are lasting longer, occurring more often and becoming more intense,” the report said. “The likelihood of such warm winters occurring will continue to increase as global temperatures rise.” The report used research by Andrew King, a climate extremes research fellow at the University of Melbourne, to argue that the “exceptionally” warm and dry winter was caused by climate change. King used computer climate models to compare today’s human-impacted climate with simulations representing an alternative world that excluded human influences.  He found the record winter temperatures were 60 times more likely to have been caused by human-included climate change. “Another way of putting that is if we hadn’t had climate change at all the chance of getting a winter like this would be much smaller,” he said. “It would be a very, very unlikely event.” The Climate Council report warns that the increased incidence of runs of hot weather affects the agriculture and energy sectors. As summer approaches, large parts of the country are in increased bushfire danger. Last week firefighters across Australia’s east coast were tested by record September temperatures as a total fire ban was issued in parts of New South Wales.  “In the south these areas broadly include the Australian Capital Territory, south and east Victoria, eastern NSW, south and central Queensland, and southern and northern regions of South Australia,” it warns. “Further, the warm and dry winter conditions mean the southern fire season is likely to begin earlier than usual.” The warmer-than-average temperatures were predicted by the Bureau of Meteorology in its winter outlook published in May. It stated that, in addition to “natural drivers” such as the El Niño weather pattern, Australia’s climate was “being influenced by the long-term increasing trend in global air and ocean temperatures”."

"For three years now, Somaliland, like much of East Africa, has experienced extreme drought. Drought that has become more and more severe, until earlier this year, with thousands on the brink of starvation, the government of Somaliland declared a national emergency. The crisis should serve as a warning to the rest of the world to prepare – and prepare well – for extreme weather events, which are occurring with greater frequency and ferocity than ever before.   As the drought ravages the communities of Somaliland and its neighbours, hurricane Irma is making its destructive path through the Caribbean islands towards Florida. Countries in South Asia have been battling floods affecting more than 24 million people. Hurricane Harvey has wreaked havoc on the United States’ Gulf of Mexico. Sierra Leone has scrambled to respond to the deadly impacts of a landslide that took nearly 500 lives. Needless to say, the impacts of these events are wide reaching. They extend beyond the obvious food, water and shelter shortages to the inevitable knock-on effects, such as mass migration within and across country borders, and the aggravation of pre-existing inequalities. I’ve recently spent two weeks in the small, self-declared independent state in the northwest of Somalia, meeting women leading the humanitarian response to the disaster in their villages. Just hours outside Hargeisa, Somaliland’s tiny capital, I met women in drought-ravaged communities who have taken up leadership roles for the first time in their lives. These women are desperate to protect the lives of those most at risk in the ongoing crisis.  The impact of the drought on Somaliland’s communities has been extreme. The first two years were increasingly difficult, the women told me, but this last year has been the worst. After years of coping with dwindling water supplies – supplies required for business, for food preparation, for sanitation – it eventually evaporated almost entirely. Money ran out, animals died. With little to eat, whole communities became malnourished. In Somaliland, those who were marginalised before the drought have experienced its greatest effects. In Saylabari, women have formed a collective to ensure that those most in need are the first to receive assistance when aid is distributed in their village.  And who are most affected? Women, they tell me. Women, who have long borne the brunt of a patriarchal system, and its brutish brother, poverty.  Singularly responsible for the care of their children, the stress that mothers have experienced in the drought has been severe. High rates of illiteracy among women who have been denied education means less access to information about what relief is on its way and who will have access to it.  Levels of domestic violence have increased significantly. Women whose husbands have left in search of alternative income are now responsible for providing for their families, as well as caring for them. Forced to forage for water in far off places, women are often raped on their journeys.  For those who migrate, the stories are worse. Over the past six months, people have left their homes in great numbers to search for water and for places their animals can graze on healthy vegetation. Leaving is a gamble –people leave in the hope that there is more sustenance further afield, but without any guarantee of finding it.  Somaliland’s experience of disaster is typical of any emergency insofar as it disproportionately affects women and those marginalised before the crisis. This is a well-recognised truth that should teach us an important lesson. The only way to prepare adequately for disasters of this scale is to address the deeply entrenched gender inequalities in access to resources and decision making.  One hundred kilometres from Saylabari and its women’s collective, a burgeoning women’s coalition have waged their own humanitarian response to the crisis in the village of Gorgeysa.  Their own community is unaffected by the drought, but the women’s coalition introduced a policy that every family in the community must take in two families. Chairwoman Ruun Essa Habane said, “We were receiving so many migrants – so many people who were searching for safety and for food and water. We had to work out how we could care for them.”  The collective pooled its resources, resources that the women had been saving over the three years that they have been working together. They used them to provide for those in their care. They donated clothes.  When I expressed my stunned (Australian) admiration, Essa Habane seemed surprised. “What else could we do?” she said. “We have the money.”  “The community cannot make decisions without us,” said Essa Habane. “We decided we wanted to support those affected by the drought and that was it.”  There is much that Australia could learn from the women of Somaliland and their response to the country’s protracted disaster. While the women in communities in Somaliland give up the little they have to support those who lack their basic needs, Australia struggles to respond humanely to the asylum seeker crisis that we have created.  Rather than responding with kindness to our fellow human beings, our politicians wallow in arguments about space and resources, postulating threats of terrorism and disseminating notions of greedy people jumping queues to grab “our” resources.  It’s worth considering how we might respond if our leadership wouldn’t primarily consist of white advantaged men, who struggle to see beyond the privilege that has always defined their lives, to empathise with those on the margins.  How long can Australia get away with this cruel and selfish response to those in need? Climate change is taking its toll – and it’s a toll that will eventually catch us up.  Extreme weather events are already leading to forced migration, in Somaliland and well beyond it, and in the years to come, millions of people will be on the move, in desperate search of food and water.  If we are to respond effectively to these impending crises – if we are, like the women of Gorgeysa and Saylabari, to ensure that nobody goes without, especially those most vulnerable – we must take action now to ensure that women are equally represented in leadership positions, and that they have the support to maintain them.  Female leaders create space for other women to take up leadership roles and to participate fully in decision making. They consistently make decisions that benefit whole communities, and ensure that everybody is considered and cared for.    At the end of every conversation I had with different women in Somaliland, they would ask me the same question: “What are things like for women in your country? What advice do you have for us as we strive for greater things – for presidency?”  All I could tell them was that in Australia, we’ve taken great steps forward but that the road ahead is long. I said that we could learn from them. That by supporting women’s leadership, perhaps we too, some day, might say, “What else could we do? We have the money.” "
"In an industrial greenhouse about 30km from Zurich, plump aubergines and juicy cherry tomatoes are ripening to perfection. Growing Mediterranean crops in Switzerland would traditionally be energy intensive but these vegetables are very nearly carbon-neutral. The greenhouse uses waste energy from a nearby refuse plant, and carbon dioxide from the world’s first commercial direct air capture plant. The facility, designed by Zurich-based start-up Climeworks, pumps the gas into greenhouses to boost the plants’ photosynthesis and increase their yield, it hopes, by up to 20%. Climeworks says it will extract around 900 tonnes of CO2 a year from the air.  The company’s end game is not plumper tomatoes but something far more ambitious – proving that carbon dioxide can be recycled from the atmosphere and turned into something useful. If this installation is a success, Climeworks wants to sell its concentrated carbon dioxide to companies producing carbon-neutral hydrocarbon fuels. With concentrations of CO2 at their highest in the last 400,000 years, the world needs to remove the greenhouse gas from the atmosphere – as well as cut emissions – if we are to avoid catastrophic climate change.  Of course, nature has been recycling carbon dioxide for millions of years. Photosynthesis turns sunlight, carbon dioxide and water into sugars which fuel plants, which provide us with food, wood and complex sugars for fuel. But most plants turn less than 1% of the solar energy they receive into useful energy-rich compounds.  Scientists and entrepreneurs are working on technologies that they hope will improve on nature and make recycling carbon dioxide a profitable industry.   The World Economic Forum and Scientific American recently named an artificial leaf as one of the top emerging technologies of 2017. Dan Nocera, a chemist at Harvard University, is one of the scientists working on developing this “leaf”, which looks like a small, plain computer chip.  Nocera’s leaf has an energy efficiency of around 10%, according to his paper published last year in Science, a peer-reviewed academic journal. It has two processes. The first is an electrochemical system that uses metal catalysts and electricity from solar panels to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. Then the hydrogen, along with carbon dioxide, is fed to bacteria commonly found in soil and water. The bacteria convert the gases into alcohols like methanol and ethanol that are the precursors to liquid fuels.  These “solar fuels” – so called because they are made from nothing more than sunlight, water and air – could be a carbon neutral drop-in replacement for today’s fossil fuels.  Nocera’s ultimate vision is a cheap, standalone solar-powered system for developing countries to turn water into fuel for vehicles, cooking or power generation. His initial target market is India, where he hopes local scientists and entrepreneurs will help to commercialise the system, although he admits that his technology is years from commercialisation.  In the meantime, several start-ups are trying to beat Nocera to a practical system to recycle CO2 into useful products. Like Nocera’s leaf, all are designed to run on a trickle of electricity from solar panels.  In 2015, Staff Sheehan left Yale University and founded Catalytic Innovations to use metal catalysts like Nocera’s to turn carbon dioxide and water into ethanol, a biofuel that is already added to petrol in many countries to reduce its carbon footprint. Another start-up, Opus 12, recently spun out of Stanford University in Silicon Valley says it’s “recreating photosynthesis, but at warp speed”. The company says its tech can be used at any source of CO2 emissions to produce syngas. This mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide can be burned like natural gas or used to produce a range of industrial chemicals.  And at the annual American Chemical Society meeting in Washington DC last month, a small company called Dioxide Materials said that it had developed electrolysis technology that could split carbon dioxide into oxygen and carbon monoxide – a precursor for methanol – with twice the efficiency of previous systems.  In order for CO2 recycling systems to operate efficiently, however, the gas has to be captured and concentrated from sources such as factories and power stations – or extracted from the air using a system like Climeworks’. And that isn’t cheap.  Capturing CO2 at a factory chimney could cost up to $80 per ton, according to research from the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions. Extracting from thin air is pricier still. Climeworks says it currently costs around $600 to extract a ton of CO2, although it expects that price to halve in its second-generation plant. “Technologies to capture CO2 from the air, like Climeworks’ units, have the potential for the sort of steep price declines that we’ve seen from solar, wind, and batteries, which are also factory manufactured products,” says Matt Lucas of the Center for Carbon Removal, a non-profit dedicated to curtailing climate change. “But if we want to compete with gasoline,” says Sheehan, “that cost has to be practically nothing.”   There are a couple of dozen large-scale projects underway to capture and store carbon dioxide from industrial facilities, including a pilot in India turning CO2 into baking soda. However, the International Energy Agency says they are not on track to meet its objective for more than 100 projects by 2020.  Another challenge is the swift change in the political climate. “Traditionally, solar-fuelled artificial photosynthesis has been a government-funded effort,” says Dick Co, director of the Solar Fuels Institute, a global team of scientists working to recycle CO2 into fuels. “But accelerated by the US election last year, we’re seeing a quick shift from government money to philanthropists like Bill Gates and Tom Steyer.” It’s unknown whether these philanthropists will be committed to funding solar fuels over the years and decades they will need to reach commercial reality.  For young companies like Catalytic Innovations, that means seeking out every source of funding. Sheehan’s start-up has made it to the semi-finals of the NRG Cosia Carbon XPrize, a $20m competition to recycle waste carbon dioxide from power plants into valuable fuel or building materials. He is now looking for money to build a larger prototype in the hope of making it to the final round – which would come with half a million dollars seed money.  "
"Senior Trump administration officials on Sunday signalled a further softening of America’s resolve to leave the Paris climate accord, amid signs that the issue will be discussed at the United Nations general assembly in New York this week. Secretary of state Rex Tillerson and national security adviser HR McMaster both indicated that the US is open to negotiations on staying in the landmark international agreement to limit mankind’s role in global warming.  Donald Trump announced the withdrawal from the deal in June, leaving the US with only Syria and Nicaragua for company outside the global agreement. A US withdrawal from a deal made under the Obama administration was a Trump campaign pledge. The rules of the pact do not, however, allow the US to physically pull out until 2020. On Saturday the White House denied reports that it planned to remain in the agreement, saying its position on leaving was unchanged and that it would only stay in if it got more “favourable” terms. Although Tillerson and McMaster reiterated that the US wants a better deal, their willingness to talk about potential discussions on remaining in the accord was in striking contrast to the hostile tone taken by Trump on the issue and America’s previous position: that it planned to leave first and negotiate later. “The president said he is open to finding those conditions where we can remain engaged with others on what we all agree is still a challenging issue,” Tillerson told CBS’s Face the Nation. Tillerson said Gary Cohn, Trump’s top economic adviser, was overseeing policy discussions for the White House. “So I think the plan is for Director Cohn to consider other ways in which we can work with partners in the Paris climate accord. We want to be productive. We want to be helpful.” The Trump administration was forced to issue its statement on Saturday after reports emerged from ministerial talks in Montreal, involving more than 30 countries and held in preparation for the next UN climate summit, in Bonn in November. Citing the European Union climate commissioner, Miguel Cañete, the Wall Street Journal reported that Trump officials had said they would not pull out of the Paris accord and were offering to re-engage. Jochen Flasbarth, the German environment ministry state secretary who attended the Montreal meeting, disputed the accuracy of the report, saying in a statement emailed to the Guardian: “This is obviously a misunderstanding. The head of the US delegation did not imply that the US would reconsider its decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement.  “However, the Montreal talks were constructive and showed that the US administration does not want to cut all ties with the international climate community.”  McMaster said on ABC’s This Week it was possible the US would stay in the accord “if there’s an agreement that benefits the American people, certainly”. “The president is open to any discussions that will help us improve the environment,” he said, “that will help ensure our energy security and will advance out prosperity and the prosperity of American businesses and American workers.” Flasbarth said: “The Paris agreement cannot be renegotiated. National pledges can be updated but not weakened. After all, current pledges are not sufficient to limit global warming to 2C, let alone 1.5C.” The accord was reached in 2015, after many years of trying. Negotiators cheered and wept as more than 200 countries including the US and China pledged to limit emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. Tillerson said that according to Trump, “we are willing to work with partners if we can construct a set of terms that we believe is fair and balanced for the American people.” He said the accord gave too much favour to China, but said the president was open to “finding the right conditions”. The apparent switch to diplomacy from such prominent White House officials could signal that Trump is retreating from his hardline course on climate change, which he famously called “a hoax”.  Staying in the Paris deal would also be another reversal on a signature policy issue. In recent weeks, Trump has secured a deal with Democratic leaders over the debt ceiling and government funding and indicated he is open to working across the aisle on immigration. Such moves are not popular with the hard-right Republican base that sustains a president with historically low approval ratings. McMaster, who said the Paris accord “gave the biggest polluters a free ride”, said Trump had said the US would pull out of the accord but could re-enter if conditions were favourable."
"The hurricanes battering the Caribbean are a deadly reminder of the immense force of nature. They show with stark clarity what happens when those with the most power fail to protect those with the least, and when those with the greatest ability to tackle the growing threat of climate breakdown shirk their responsibility to those who face its worst effects. The story of our recent past and our present is of a handful of powerful people acting against the interests of everyone else. Those who make it to the top – of multinational corporations and of government – defend themselves and the status quo against all attacks, deepening inequality in society and sowing the seeds of planetary destruction. The future doesn’t need to be like this, but if we want to write a different story we need to start now.  The political challenge of our day is not only to share wealth and power more evenly, but to collectively design a future where we all thrive. At next month’s Green party conference we will be thinking big – once again putting forward bold ideas today that will become commonplace tomorrow. Our starting point is nothing short of the liberation of the human spirit – meaning we reject simply tinkering with a welfare state that’s become synonymous with suffering, or endlessly measuring gross domestic product while neglecting our wellbeing. Our economy kills people’s aspirations, and hands unjustifiable rewards to those who least need them. The threat of Brexit, the challenge of automation, the dangers of ballooning personal debt, the risk of another banking crash and spiralling wealth at the top: to face these headwinds we must comprehensively reshape our collective economic future. It is time to ask fundamental questions about what the economy is for and how it can be redesigned to serve society – and, as the philosopher and politician Roberto Unger puts it, ensure everyone has “a better chance to live a larger life”. People should have decent, well-paid work, yes, but that’s not ambitious enough. We believe people should have more time off, and be liberated from the shackles of wage labour. A larger life has purpose and balance and is rich with opportunities. That larger life requires genuine social security – and it is not enough to fight a constant rearguard action against the destruction of the welfare state as it is. We want to pioneer a basic income because it could end poverty in Britain, for ever, and liberate people to fulfil their potential and their dreams. As Unger said so powerfully, our aim should be to “die only once”, and avoid the “many small deaths” that plague existence in contemporary society – especially, we would argue, for anyone accessing the benefits system. We know that any politics that fails to understand the environmental limits of our planet is ultimately redundant. We don’t just need a technological shift, we need a paradigm shift. Greens are willing to speak that to those in power – and peacefully put our bodies on the line for it. A glance at climate science – and the destruction already faced as the world heats up – is enough to show why we need to not just change gear, but change vehicle. We would keep fossil fuels buried in the ground, scrap dirty nuclear and invest in renewables, but we also know that’s not enough. We want people to own their own energy creation – making every home a mini power station, and giving everyone in a community real control. We also need to reassess how we measure progress, and reject the outdated metric of gross domestic product. We need to transform our cities, and move beyond the motor car as the default mode of transport. It’s also time to challenge longstanding power structures by rethinking Britain’s place on the world stage. Central to this is our belief in peacebuilding and cooperation – rejecting the UK’s imperial past and the powerful military industrial complex that drives so many of the UK’s priorities overseas. We’re proud internationalists – which is why we will continue to fight for membership of the European Union or as close ties as possible. We’d end Britain’s role as the world’s arms merchant and scrap Trident, employing our skills instead to utilise the clean, natural, renewable resources of the British Isles. We would rebuild the country as a diplomatic leader on the world stage – not a friend of despots and dictators. We believe Britain should be open. Where others refuse to acknowledge the facts, we say loudly and proudly that migration benefits the UK, and free movement within Europe is a precious gift. And no matter how loud newspaper editors and divisive politicians shout, we are not afraid to say that we welcome refugees to our country. The Green party believes in real change through power being wielded by more and more people. That’s why we continue to advocate real democracy that starts with proportional elections to parliament, and filters all the way down to community-led budgeting. No single party has a monopoly on wisdom – strength is found in diversity and pluralism, not in a political monoculture. We question overreach by government agencies, oppose ministers when they unnecessarily pry into people’s lives, and keep tabs on those in power – whether they’re from the police, military or government. We also recognise that power shouldn’t just reside with the state – which is why we advocate local control whenever possible. The story of the future is already being written by the neighbourhoods generating their own solar power, taking over their local pubs as valuable community assets and setting up their own local produce schemes to give the poorest residents subsidised access to fresh food. It’s being redesigned by the coders and creators building new communities online and sharing tools that facilitate collaboration and collective problem-solving. It’s a diverse, networked, energetic and exciting future – and it needs a political and economic system that’s the same. From our consistent opposition to austerity to our focus on the climate crisis and support for LGBTQI rights, we have always been trailblazers. We aren’t afraid to stick our heads above the parapet, to push the parameters of the politically possible. And where we lead, others follow. Look at how our London assembly members forced the living wage on to the political agenda, how our councillors were pioneers for community-owned solar, how our MEPs stood up for refugees when others stood back. And how in parliament we’ve consistently kept climate change on the agenda as those in power have tried to push it away. We are living through climate breakdown. We have an economy that prizes pointless jobs and condemns people to a lifetime of drudgery. We have an electoral system that excludes everyone outside of swing seats. Britain needs a party that makes the desirable feasible – that says what needs to be said, not what is deemed acceptable by the powers that be. In these febrile times the Green party is an insurgent force for good – speaking truth to those in power and consistently asking the big questions that matter. Greens are pioneers or we are nothing – and in the coming months we will be bolder and braver than ever before. • Caroline Lucas and Jonathan Bartley are co-leaders of the Green party"

"The climate ambitions of the Finkel review appear to be being watered down by the government as it is implemented, according to a draft Coag Energy Council implementation strategy obtained by the Guardian.  The draft implementation plan removes a key recommendation for an agreed emissions trajectory for the electricity system, alignment with the Paris agreement and subsidised solar and batteries for low-income houses.  Sources tell the Guardian the document was prepared by the federal government and distributed to state and territory representatives on the morning of the meeting, leaving little time for state representatives to analyse it. A final version of the document is expected to be delivered to Coag today. The federal environment and energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, declined to comment on the document, saying: “It is not appropriate for any government to comment on draft documents of the Council of Australian Governments.” Described by the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, as a “blueprint for the once-in-a-century transformation currently taking placing in Australia’s energy system”, the Finkel review presented 50 recommendations to the Council of Australian Governments (Coag). Those recommendations were intended to solve the energy “trilemma” – delivering affordable and reliable electricity, while lowering emissions. The review itself was widely criticised for lacking in ambition when it came to action on climate change, and failing to align with Australia’s commitments made in the Paris climate agreement. The key recommendation of the review was a clean energy target, which Frydenberg has so far failed to get approved by the joint Coalition party room, which includes a number of climate change deniers. But the party room agreed to the other 49 recommendations, which the Coag Energy Council is now advising heads of government on how to implement. At a teleconference on Friday last week, state and territory energy ministers were presented with a draft implementation plan for discussion. That document, obtained by the Guardian, appears to water down those recommendations in relation to climate change, and removes some altogether. One key recommendation in the Finkel review that has been severely weakened in the draft implementation document is a change that would force the electricity market to align efforts to meet government emissions reduction commitments made as part of the Paris agreement. Finkel’s recommendation said Coag leaders should agree to a new Australian Energy Market Agreement, which commits all parties to “a nationally consistent approach to energy policy that recognises Australia’s commitment in Paris to reduce emissions and governments’ commitment to align efforts to meet this target with energy market frameworks.” But the draft implementation document removes the reference to international emissions reduction commitments, instead saying merely that the agreement will “reaffirm Australian governments’ commitment to the [national electricity market] and a national, integrated approach to energy and emissions reduction policy”. Among Finkel’s key recommendation for an “orderly transition”, he called for three things: the clean energy target; a three-year notice of closure for existing large generators; and “an agreed emissions reduction trajectory”. All three moves were part of one recommendation, numbered 3.2. The Coalition has not agreed to adopt the clean energy target but it has agreed to the three-year notice-of-closure rule, which appears in the implementation plan. However, the plan does not contain any mention of an agreed emissions reduction trajectory. Frydenberg told the Guardian his view is that the Coag Energy Council did not agree to the emissions reduction trajectory because it is part of the clean energy target. “The Coag Energy Council has agreed to implement the recommendations of the Finkel review except for the clean energy target, which includes the national electricity market emissions trajectory which the federal government is currently considering.” It is unclear why the emissions trajectory is considered part of the clean energy target, since the Finkel review makes clear that there are a number of mechanisms that could achieve such a trajectory. Finkel modelled several such mechanisms, including an emissions intensity scheme. Another Finkel recommendation calls for low-income households to be given subsidised access to “energy efficient appliances, rooftop solar photovoltaic and battery storage systems”. Explicit references to renewable energy has been removed in the draft implementation plan and replaced with “energy efficiency and demand management technologies”. Sources say representatives of the ACT raised the question of the trajectory being removed, and asked for it to be included. Representatives of Queensland and Victoria also apparently raised concerns about some of the other changes. Sources said the document, which was prepared by the federal government, was circulated to state energy ministers only hours before the meeting was held, leaving little time for proper scrutiny. The document is expected to be finalised and sent to heads of government today."

"Hurricane Katrina in 2005 was “the first taste of a bitter cup that will be proffered to us over and over again,” according to former US vice president Al Gore at the time.  Since then, Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and now Hurricane Harvey have borne out this prediction. The latest storm may turn out to be less fatal than Katrina, which killed more than 1,800 people but in economic terms it may be as bad. Hurricane Katrina cost about $160bn (£124bn) in economic losses in today’s terms, accounting for the last decade’s inflation, while Sandy wrought about $70bn in damage. Preliminary estimates for the damage caused by Harvey are wide apart, spanning $90bn to $190bn, reflecting the difficulty of judging an unfolding disaster.  Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, at the London School of Economics, says: “Hurricane Harvey may turn out to be the most damaging weather disaster to have hit the US. It will take some time before we know what the full cost is [and] in addition to the physical damage there will be the economic losses from businesses that cannot operate. If Houston is slow to recover from the impacts, the losses will mount.” In the UK, motorists have been warned that petrol prices are likely to rise sharply as the effect of Hurricane Harvey on oil production is felt. If past disasters are anything to go by, about half of the direct, local cost of Hurricane Harvey is likely to be picked up eventually by insurers, with the rest borne by the public purse and by individuals and businesses. Insurers have taken an increasingly active role in the last decade in warning of the potential for more intense storms, floods, droughts and other natural disasters as a result of climate change, and of our failure to protect a rising population and increasingly complex infrastructure against these effects. “We have been working on climate change since the 1970s,” says Ernst Rauch, head of climate and public sector business development at Munich Re. “We are one of the largest risk takers and it is essential we understand these potential risks. This is crucial to us.” For insurers, the key issue is the resilience of populations and infrastructure – the ability to deal with disasters when they happen. In most situations, this requires government planning, working with the private sector to help proof homes and buildings against severe weather. But while insurers have grown acutely aware of these risks, governments and other parts of the private sector have lagged behind. “We see the need at a global scale for societies and public risk managers like government and local authorities to pay more attention to the reduction of risk and resilience building,” says Rauch. “Otherwise we will see an ongoing increase in losses, driven and intensified by climate change.” Weather catastrophes are now six times more frequent than in 1950 Caspar Honegger, who heads global flood peril assessment at Swiss Re, reports that after Superstorm Sandy hit New York, the city asked his team to analyse the climate risks for the next 40 years. They found that rising sea levels and the increasing frequency of storms would raise average annual losses by 170% to $4.4bn.  ClimateWise – a coalition of 29 insurers including Allianz, Lloyd’s, Zurich, Prudential and Swiss Re – warned of a growing “protection gap” between the cost of natural disasters and the amount insured for. The group said weather catastrophes – which are now six times more frequent than in 1950 – are making some assets uninsurable and advised more investment in building resilience against floods and heat waves. The online property company Zillow estimates that 1.9 million homes in the US, valued at a combined $882bn, could be submerged by the end of the century as sea levels rise and storm surges erode coastlines and riverbanks. Florida would be worst affected, losing one in eight properties, followed by Hawaii with one in 10. Insurers now treat this as a board level issue, with chief executives reporting to their shareholders on the increasing risk from climate-related disasters, and working with the UN, World Bank and national governments. As their business relies on understanding risk, they have taken a lead not just in pricing in new risks but in encouraging efforts to reduce them. Insurers are among the top global investors in renewable energy, and some are considering divesting from fossil fuels. They have funded studies of vulnerability and ways to adapt to climate change, and urged governments to protect their populations from the potential ravages of warming. Yet not enough is being done, warns Rauch. “Not enough account is taken of climate change at the public decision-making level. Climate change is not something that is going to have an impact in a hundred years, its impact is already felt today. That’s why we need to adapt to the consequences, such as by investing in infrastructure, fortifying homes, building levees and dykes, maybe removing homes from highly exposed zones.” In part this lack of preparedness is down to the cost of equipping communities with better protection and better recovery mechanisms. But for more than a decade, since the pivotal Stern review of the economics of climate change in 2006, an increasing body of work has demonstrated that dealing with emissions and the probable effects of climate change now will save money in the medium and longer term. “The longer we fail to act the more expensive it will be; the sooner we act, the cheaper. Doing nothing will be much more expensive,” says Rauch. But insurance does offer one big advantage in assessing the likely impacts of climate disasters, says Rauch. “We are very transparent. Insurance premiums reflect risk based on two factors: first is the underlying hazard, that is the probability of an event occurring, and the second is the vulnerability if an event occurs. If the hazard is driven up by climate change, you can still reduce vulnerability, by investing in protection and fortifying homes, such as by building them to higher standards. Then the premiums could remain constant. But if you keep everything as it is today and the risk goes up, they would have to rise.” In Florida, for instance, lax building regulations mean buildings are more vulnerable, as well as more at risk, and premiums are higher accordingly – more than $2,000 for insurance coverage that would cost less than €200 in Germany, according to Rauch. “At the end of the day, insurance is a simple system and one of the biggest benefits is that we put a price tag on risk – so in a functioning market everyone can understand where the risk is higher.”"
"They sat through hours of pummelling by Hurricane Irma, with winds pounding them at up to 115mph and rain driving in a solid white sheet as bright as a snow blizzard. Then on Monday, Floridians woke up to survey the damage, begin the cleanup and get back to carrying on regardless. By noon, the jet skiers were back on the water, buzzing around the west coast waterways under a blue sky where only hours before Irma had shaken the trees and put fear in people’s hearts. The catastrophe that had been forewarned over countless hours of rolling cable television appeared to have been avoided. But only narrowly. For its lucky escape, the US has Cuba to thank, given that the northern coast of the island soaked up an important part of Irma’s energy before the storm reached Florida. Not that the debt of gratitude will be repaid by the current incumbent of the White House. On Marco Island, a residential area on the west coast south of Naples where Irma made landfall on Sunday afternoon, hundreds of cars were lining up at the causeways. Their owners were desperate to get back home. They always tell us we will have a storm surge. I know they're doing it for safety reasons but I’ve never seen it happen But police barriers were preventing access and the island continued to be eerily empty of vehicles and people. You could have mistaken the day for one of the major holidays, Christmas or Thanksgiving, were it not for hundreds of trees strewn across the roads like green confetti. Despite the profuse warnings and orders to evacuate, about 1,000 people rode out the storm on Marco Island. All appeared safe, though windows were blown out in condominiums on the main waterfront. The question now is whether local residents, Floridians and by extension America writ large will ponder the lessons of Irma, consider its portent of intensifying extreme weather in the wake of climate change, and decide to do something about it. The early message coming from Marcos Islanders on Monday was crystal clear. No. Chris Roche, 52, a real estate lawyer, was taking a long hard look at the damage to his home. Three trees were down in the yard, some tiles had come off the roof and there were signs of grey mud on the road – Irma’s calling card, dredged up from the seabed and deposited right outside his door. That was enough destruction to be getting on with. Wasn’t he fed up with the constant disruption of his life, a pounding that was certain to get worse with sea-level rise and growing weather disturbances caused by climate change? This was the fifth or sixth hurricane he had sat through since he moved on to the island in 1979, he said with the nonchalance of someone discussing trips to the theater. He was more than a little skeptical of the warnings to evacuate which he had heard and duly ignored. “They always tell us we will have a storm surge,” he said. “I know they are doing it for safety reasons, but I’ve never seen it happen.” As for climate change? “I don’t think climate change is such a big deal.” That was quite a striking comment just hours after a massive hurricane of terrifying force, some of which may have been the gift of global warming, tore through his home.  “I don’t think man is the tipping point. I think it’s more natural than that. We’re not experiencing historically close [to] high temperatures, not even close to it.” On the other side of the island, in a group of mansion houses known as “the estate”, John Sullivan, 63, was cleaning up the driveway of a friend’s house that was strewn with palm fronds. He’d ridden the storm out there as it had a generator for power, which was otherwise down throughout the west coast. “I really thought we were going to get hammered this time,” he said. “Take away the downed trees and the missing roof tiles, for a cat[egory] 4 hurricane we could have done a whole lot worse.” Back in the evacuated hotel in Naples, Florida, where the Guardian and other journalists hunkered down as the storm passed through on Sunday, the storm chasers were packing their bags and preparing to move on to the next Big One. This time in Taiwan. “I think Irma did great,” one said. “It was a very solid hurricane. Very solid indeed.” "
"Universities have faced an onslaught of criticism this summer, from outrage over the “greed” of vice-chancellors to claims that tuition fees are “blighting young people’s futures”. The fallout saw Labour MP Darren Jones resign from an advisory board at the University of Bath over revelations about its vice-chancellor’s 11% pay rise. Last week, it culminated in a speech from Alistair Jarvis, the new chief executive of Universities UK, the representative body for vice-chancellors, in which he denounced critics of universities as people pushing “misinformation, muddled argument and even a little malicious intent”. With a fresh academic year looming, we sought expert advice for university leaders preparing to tackle whatever the new term throws at them. From facing media scrutiny to ensuring your institution isn’t funding climate change, here’s what the professionals recommend.  Media expert Sarah Dickinson, author and founder of media training consultancy Electric Airwaves Vice-chancellors are really in the hot seat at the moment, mainly because there’s been controversy about what they earn, so all vice-chancellors need to be as ready as they can for what I believe to be legitimate media scrutiny. When you come face-to-face with a journalist your brain forgets all the positive things you’ve been doing and the negative things come to the forefront. Always carry a mental suitcase of the positive things you have initiated at your university. For instance, it might be that through your work and that of your colleagues you have been able to establish a fund to build a new technology wing. Have the confidence to use the personal pronoun. It has much more resonance if anyone in a position of authority can say: “If you want to know personally what I think…”. That way, your arguments will come across much more passionately. Make sure you constantly update your views on current controversial issues, from why the finances of the Universities Superannuation Scheme have deteriorated, to historic statues such as Cecil Rhodes, to LGBT rights. As long as you follow these very basic rules, you should always be able to treat interviews as an opportunity, not a threat. Eco-fashion expert, journalist and TV presenter Lucy Siegle When people become conscious of being singled out as over-paid, the danger is they virtue signal by wearing low-cost fast fashion. I see this a lot with celebrities trying to say “I’m one of you”. It succeeds only in bolstering the false idea that fast fashion is in someway democratic. It’s not. It’s a destroyer of the environment and creates obscene wealth in terms of fast fashion moguls. The best thing well-remunerated people can do is spend outside of this system and make it count. I’m a big fan of bespoke garments, especially suiting in good fabrics – you can find out a lot about mills and production these days.  We have a really healthy sustainable fashion ecosystem in the UK right now. For occasion wear, I think Kitty Ferreira is unbeatable. We also have a mainstream ethical hit on our hand through longstanding eco-shoe brand Po-Zu. I think the People Tree ethical collection with the V&A is a winner for female vice-chancellors. Not everyone will feel comfortable increasing their fashion budget, but there are brands that address part of the puzzle. Ex-teacher Sarah Jerath established her own brand, Two For Joy, where you can find out exactly where the cost of the clothes is being distributed. Increasingly we are seeing a lot of UK students doing practical fashion courses and learning to cut and sew. Wouldn’t it be great if vice-chancellors could wear students’ creations? Divestment expert Chris Saltmarsh, fossil free campaigns coordinator at People & Planet Higher education institutions have committed to remove more than £80bn of investments out of oil, coal and gas companies globally. The UK higher education sector is leading the way, with institutions accounting for nearly half of over 100 universities worldwide that have made pledges. To date, a third of universities have made a fossil fuel divestment pledge of some kind. As the academic year resumes and vice-chancellors mull over how they can use their significant power to contribute to the challenge of avoiding catastrophic climate change, they can draw inspiration from this ever-growing divestment movement. For divestment to be effective, vice-chancellors must ensure three things. Firstly, their commitments must be made public to help build the movement against fossil fuel companies. Secondly, their commitments must be full – the divestment must encompass all fossil fuels and fossil fuel companies. Finally, their commitments must be time-bound so students and staff know when they plan to move their money by – usually within one to three years – and can hold them accountable.  If a university has already made a divestment commitment, there is still a lot to be done. People & Planet’s Divest Barclays campaign, for example, encourages universities to boycott Barclays until the bank stops financing fossil fuel projects, this could be by removing a Barclays branch from campus, switching the university’s bank account provider or excluding them from careers and recruitment fairs. Tech and education expert Anne-Marie Imafidon MBE, CEO of Stemettes, a social enterprise working to inspire young women into Stem roles Universities are typically set up along faculty or department lines. Students in those groups are kept within those groups. It’s important to create environments where people are able to talk across departments and disciplines in a way that leaves them rewarded for contributing to a higher-level discussion. When I was at university there were physical spaces for people to come together to work, enabling that cross-pollination of ideas. Even if they’re not permanent spaces, the action of bringing people together to share thoughts and ideas can be invaluable. Innovation comes from environments where groupthink is not allowed to flourish. Industry is a great driver for innovative thinking on campus. There’s talk among some of the university departments I’m involved with around tech hubs opening in or near universities, where you’re able to connect people – whether it’s PhD students or researchers – with industry, allowing those working at universities to experiment with their ideas.  It’s important to involve everybody. Innovative ideas and new perspectives can come from anywhere. Universities must not fall into old habits of following traditional academic hierarchies. Whether it’s new academic staff or new students coming in, getting them involved can be invaluable because there will be things they are able to look at with fresh eyes.

"The Florida Keys are still closed until further notice. On the far side of the blockade that inhabitants of the lower Keys negotiate to return to their homes, the US One highway, a tarmac spine over the limestone vertebrae of the islands, makes its way 127 miles down to Key West, battered and torn. Key West, final south-easterly outpost of mainland North America and the self-styled “last resort”, is, still, four days after Hurricane Irma hit, almost completely out of contact with the outside world. Images have been surfacing all week. In Marathon, the sea draining away from an entire bay like dishwater off a dirty plate, leaving the ocean floor exposed to the daylight, while a woman films it from her balcony and screams: “My God! My God! The sea is gone!” In Key Largo, a stretch limousine banked crosswise across the highway. Big fridges stranded on plinths of trashed seagrass and mangrove leaves, their doors open, still full of food. Cars blown the short distance from road to shoreline, sideways in the shallows in a rusty puddle of their own fluids. Boats that have cracked the road with the force with which they’ve landed; in Islamorada, someone’s house being thrown along a lagoon and landing crooked in a new spot. I know and love these islands well. I’m wondering what they did with the dolphins in the sea aquarium; how the evacuation of the mental health facilities went; whether the drive-through bank where I used to cash my pay cheque got wrecked; what it’s like in the Winn-Dixie supermarket right now, and in the Kmart, in the dark. As the search-and-rescue operation moves further into the devastated Keys, I’m watching from England to see how this first-world humanitarian disaster unfolds. It’s an extraordinary corner of America: sub-tropical, subaqueous, and not especially suited for habitation. I’m wondering if its 70,000 inhabitants may be the canaries in the coalmine for the realities of climate change as it hits the developed world. The Keys are extreme. Curving away from the bottom tip of Florida, they nose out to sea in dribs and drabs towards the Caribbean. They’ve been fully inhabited for only 150 years. Drinking water has to be piped in from the mainland; the inhabitants used rainwater until 1940. The first Coca-Cola bottling plant arrived here in 1908 and they made the Coke with rainwater. Limestone, Miami oolite and white coral form what land there is; much of the territory consists of tracts of rich, eggy sea grass and webs of island-building mangrove. The boundaries between land and sea are porous: they call this terrain “the heavy dew”. Hurricane season lasts from May to November, during which time everyone is on evacuation alert. Inhabitants are below or only just above sea level. It’s scorching nearly all the time. Humidity is high. Reliance on air-conditioning is total. Machines roam the streets misting inhabited areas with mosquito repellent. The sewage infrastructure is questionable. These islands are a complex and fragile ecosystem. They are surrounded by the only living barrier reef in the continental United States, which forms a natural surf-break: their rigid structures absorb the shock of the impact of waves and wind and are essential in restraining high tides and hurricanes. Coral is a delicate creature; the reefs have, in recent years, been showing signs of stress. It is heartbreakingly beautiful. Jewel-blue sea stretches away to all horizons, replacing landscape. Everything oozes salt: the ground, the air, the leaves. At the edges, boardwalks lead through sparse, creaking pockets of resolutely inhospitable wilderness. On higher ground lie incredibly species-rich hammocks: homes for gumbo limbo trees, the giant Florida tree snail, and hundreds of other site-specific creatures. This is prime real estate, too: building continues apace on these swampy blobs of land. Key West is a kind of ocean frontier town, with an eye-poppingly eccentric history. The major industry now is tourism. It brands itself relentlessly: it is the Conch Republic, Home of the Sunset, Margaritaville, and – because Route 1 runs out there – The End of the Rainbow. It’s also Paradise, trademarked: its police cars have “Protecting Paradise” stencilled on them. The official town motto is One Human Family. Paradise? It sometimes feels like it. Protected? I’m not so sure. Spending time there was, for me, both joyous and uneasy. I was preoccupied by how frightening it must be in hurricanes, finding yourself where you actually are: on a pitch-dark, stiflingly humid island; a tropical coral-drift that beneath its veneer is entirely wild. Living there is a kind of conjuring trick, a process of mind over matter. It demands a hefty measure of denial in your margarita – eyes half-shut as another perfect sunset commences and the steel band strikes up beside the cruise liner. Denial is also there in the recent news that the US Department of Agriculture is censoring the term “climate change”. Call the weather what you want, the past few days have shown that the Americans in these outposts may find themselves living in a whole new kind of frontier: involuntary pioneers in the face of these new “weather extremes” and their unprecedented storms. • Joanna Guthrie is a poet and writer"
"As communities in coastal Texas and Louisiana confront the damage wrought by Hurricane Harvey, another hurricane, Irma, fueled by abnormally warm waters, is barreling into the Caribbean and threatening Puerto Rico and Florida. We know that the costs of both hurricanes will be enormous and that climate change will have made them far larger than they would have been otherwise. How much larger? Careful studies will take time but the evidence that climate change is warming ocean waters, increasing both sea level and the risk of extreme precipitation in these regions is well established.  On 29 October 2012, when Hurricane Sandy slammed into America’s east coast, a storm surge of more than nine feet caused extensive flooding damage throughout the affected region. Researchers have since determined that the damage from that storm surge was greatly worsened by climate change. Sea level along the East Coast has risen by about eight inches since 1900, as oceans have warmed and expanded in response to rising concentrations of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere, with subsiding land adding insult to injury. According to one study, sea level rise increased Sandy’s flood damages to property in New York City alone by $2bn – more than $230 per New Yorker. Such costs from storm damage attributable to climate change are just one piece of the story. New York City estimates that it will spend an estimated $19.5bn to prepare for climate change impacts through 2030. And researchers say developing countries most vulnerable to rising seas and increasing extreme weather will need between $140bn and $300bn annually by 2030 to help them cope. Who should pay these costs? In the United States, the default assumption is that costs of climate damages and adaptation should be borne by taxpayers, through flood insurance programs, federal disaster relief funds and the like, as well as by affected individuals, families and private businesses. This assumption is now being challenged in the courts. Lawsuits filed in July by three coastal California communities against ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP and other large fossil fuel companies argue that the companies, not taxpayers and residents, should bear the cost of damages from rising seas. They draw on extensive evidence that fossil fuel companies, knowing that their products contributed substantially to climate change, engaged for decades in a coordinated campaign to publicly disparage climate science to avoid limits on emissions. These lawsuits build on a vigorous and growing debate in the court of public opinion and among company shareholders about the responsibilities of fossil fuel giants for their contributions to climate change. This is a debate fueled by high-profile evidence of some companies’ deception, the growing and devastating human and economic costs of climate change, and the recognition that even today fossil fuel companies maintain business models that assume the continued global reliance on their products that would drive heat-trapping emissions and temperatures well above the Paris agreement limits that some of the same companies profess to support. Today, we and several colleagues are publishing a peer-reviewed paper in the journal Climatic Change that shows it is possible for scientific evidence to help apportion responsibility for climate damages among fossil fuel producers. Using a simple, well-established climate model, our study for the first time quantifies the amount of sea level rise and increase in global surface temperatures that can be traced to the emissions from specific fossil fuel companies. Strikingly, nearly 30% of the rise in global sea level between 1880 and 2010 resulted from emissions traced to the 90 largest carbon producers. Emissions traced to the 20 companies named in California communities’ lawsuits contributed 10% of global sea level rise over the same period. More than 6% of the rise in global sea level resulted from emissions traced to ExxonMobil, Chevron and BP, the three largest contributors. We have the data needed to link the emissions traced to products sold by a fossil fuel company to a specific share of changes in temperature and sea level rise. Determining who should pay what for climate damages is a social and political question. But this kind of scientific work can help inform public and policy debate over the issue and potentially offers an approach that can help juries and judges to monetize damages in cases like the California communities’ lawsuits. Plainly, companies should not be at liberty to persist for decades in selling products as safe to use when they know they are harmful and have alternatives available to them. Upon learning of the risks of their products, companies could have used their considerable technical and financial resources to greatly accelerate carbon storage and clean energy technologies. Many, even within the fossil fuel industry itself, are arguing they can still change course, but it is hard to justify the immediate cost to shareholders when just using the atmosphere as a waste dump and leaving impacted communities, taxpayers and future generations to deal with the consequences appears to be a risk-free alternative. But, as we found in the 2008 financial crisis, allowing companies to make private profits while society at large underwrites the risk ends badly for everyone. It may take tens to hundreds of billions of dollars to support disaster relief and recovery among Gulf coast communities affected by Hurricane Harvey. ExxonMobil, Chevron and BP have collectively pledged only $2.75m. As scientists further identify the role that climate change has made to exacerbating this tragedy, courts of law and public opinion should judge whether they are paying their fair share."

"When Rick Kirn planted his 1,000 acres of spring wheat in May, there were no signs of a weather calamity on the horizon. Three months later, when he should have been harvesting and getting ready to sell his wheat, Kirn was staring out across vast cracked, gray, empty fields dotted with weeds and little patches of stunted wheat. “It’s a total loss for me,” said Kirn, who operates a small family wheat farm on the Fort Peck Reservation, an area of north-eastern Montana that lies right in the heart of the extreme climatic episode. “There’s nothing to harvest.”  Kirn’s story is typical across the high plains in Montana and the Dakotas this summer, where one of the country’s most important wheat growing regions is in the grips of a crippling drought that came on with hardly any warning and, experts say, is without precedent. While much of the country’s attention in recent weeks has been on the hurricanes striking southern Texas and the Caribbean, a so-called “flash drought”, an unpredictable, sudden event brought on by sustained high temperatures and little rain, has seized a swathe of the country and left farmers with little remedy. Across Montana’s northern border and east into North Dakota, farms are turning out less wheat than last year, much of it poorer quality than normal.  Most farmers in and around the Fort Peck Reservation agree that climate change is to blame for the sudden drought and ruined crops, but that doesn’t change the fact that farmers and others who make their living off of agriculture are now subject to shifting political winds and strained debate around the issue. “This is unprecedented,” says Tanja Fransen of the National Weather Service in Glasgow, a larger city just up the road from Fort Peck. “This is as dry as it’s been in recorded history and some of our recording stations have 100 years of data. A lot of people try to compare this to previous years, but really, you just can’t.” Adnan Akyuz, the state climatologist for North Dakota, describes the unusual drought in terms that are reminiscent of descriptions of deluge brought on by Hurricane Harvey. “It is safe to say, we got into it very fast, which caught us off guard and we didn’t know it was going to continue,” he says. Akyuz said that March through July was the third-driest five months on record in North Dakota since 1895, a dire situation impossible to predict given traditional methods of weighing snowpack with average seasonal temperatures to monitor for potential drought. But in the future, unpredictable may be the best prediction. “We should expect these swings and incorporate these swings into our management plans,” said Akyuz. As of late August, the US Drought Monitor classified all of Montana in some stage of drought, with 65% of the state’s vast lands in “extreme” or “exceptional” drought.  “The new normal is that now we have a warmer world, in times when you’re not getting your normal load of rain, things can go bad very quickly,” said Brenda Ekwurzel, senior climate scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists. Partly as a result of the drought, Montana is also dealing with one of its worst wildfire seasons on record. As of early September, wildfires have burned more than 1m acres – among the state’s top five most devastating fire seasons in terms of acres burned – and forecasts suggest the destruction will continue for weeks. In south-eastern Montana, cattle rancher Lillian Ostendorf explains taking turns on fire lookout duty, which entails sitting on top of a hill scanning the horizon, watching for smoke to flare up on the wide-open prairie. Fires come up quickly and move fast. Just last week, a fire that sparked on her family’s ranch spread several miles before it was put out. The situation requires constant, exhausting vigilance. “There’s lots of different stories about things starting fires right now. Everything from a horseshoe hitting a rock to lightning to vehicles going down the highway,” she says. John Youngberg, director of the Montana Farm Bureau Federation, says the extreme summer is forcing farmers and ranchers to make tough decisions every day about what they can salvage. Thus far, there’s no comprehensive estimate on agricultural losses this year in the region but the drought is taking a certain toll. “It’s a lot of pressure on people and it’s affecting people psychologically,” said Youngberg. Further to the north-west, in Jordan, near the heart of a now-contained Lodgepole Complex fire that burned 270,000 acres this summer, farmers and ranchers say the actual toll of the fire on livestock and future crops could take years to see. “We won’t know for months how the cattle were affected. We don’t know if they’ve burned their feet, or if they inhaled smoke and it affected their lungs. We have no idea,” says Teddy Roberston, a Garfield County commissioner who for 30 years made her living as a cattle rancher. “We’re tough and we have a lot of fight left in us, but it’s just going to take some time because we’ve never experienced such a catastrophic loss,” she added.  Outside of agriculture, wildfires have burned with devastating impacts. In late August, one of only two still-standing historic backpacker chalets in Glacier National Park was lost to a fire and the park has moved art and valuables from another historic lodge at Lake McDonald as fire approaches. Much of the state is blanketed by thick smoke, in some cases with air quality deteriorating to Beijing levels. Montana’s Democratic governor Steve Bullock has declared the entire state a fire disaster and warned that the battle will continue. “The reality is Montana is in a severe drought and the conditions are ripe for continued severe fires throughout September,” Bullock wrote in a Facebook post on Monday. Republican members of the state’s congressional delegation have instead blamed environmentalists for the summer of fire ruin. In an interview two weeks ago with Montana public radio, senator Steve Daines argued that lawsuits from environmental groups that prevent timber sales and logging are at fault for the massive fires.  On the ground, in places like Fort Peck, farmers are sharing the pain and resources. In North Dakota and eastern Montana, local hay-distribution programs are helping to ease the burden for those whose crops didn’t materialize. Akyuz says that while the political debate might continue, farmers and others directly affected by the disaster are figuring out how to make it through. Kirn, only one of the thousands of farmers and ranchers hit by the disaster, thinks this might be the end of his farming days. Irrigation is too expensive for small farming operations, leaving crops at the mercy of climate. “This is absolutely the worst year I’ve ever seen,” he says, gesturing across the barren fields."
"The giant Anglo-Australian miner BHP has agreed to reconsider its membership of the Minerals Council of Australia, as well as other industry groups, and to clarify how BHP’s position on climate and energy policy differs from those bodies. The move comes as BHP faces a shareholder resolution urging the company to terminate membership of bodies that demonstrate a pattern of advocacy on policy issues at odds with the company’s positions since 2012.  The resolution was moved by the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility on behalf of more than 120 shareholders of BHP. “The last decade or longer of Australian climate and energy policy has been characterised by short-lived policy subject to relentless scrutiny and adversarial campaigning by industry bodies, or no policy at all,” the ACCR said on behalf of about the shareholders in a supporting statement. The statement called for BHP to review membership of industry bodies, and singled out the Minerals Council of Australia, noting its activities have “diminished the federal government’s ability to resolve a national policy issue of material relevance to our company and the stability of its operations”. “The MCA’s activities undermine the possibility of achieving what our company has stated an ‘effective policy framework’ should include: a complementary set of measures including a price on carbon, support for low-emissions technologies, energy efficiency and measures to build resilience,” the statement said. “Over time, these activities have the potential to undermine shareholder value, given our company’s exposure to climate-related risk and energy instability.” In 2016 AGL, Australia’s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, left the MCA, citing material differences in their positions on climate change and energy. “AGL’s positions on climate change and renewable energy differed from those held by the Minerals Council of Australia and the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, and AGL has elected not to renew its membership of these organisations,” the company said. In recent months BHP has expressed public displeasure at some of the MCA’s lobbying activities.   The CSIRO has come under fire for its membership of the MCA. In a statement uploaded to the BHP website on Monday, the miner said it would review its membership of industry bodies, specifically mentioning the Minerals Council of Australia. It also committed to publishing statements on how its positions differ from industry groups on climate change. “In the past, we have always sought to make our position on significant public issues clear,” BHP said. “However, we will further our efforts to ensure that material differences with industry associations on key issues are clearly understood. “To that end, we will make public, by 31 December 2017, a list of the material differences between the positions we hold on climate and energy policy, and the advocacy positions on climate and energy policy taken by industry associations to which we belong.”"
"Public support for marriage equality has dropped 4% in a fortnight and opposition is up 3%, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll. With the postal survey campaign now in full swing, and with analysis suggesting opponents of marriage equality have outspent the yes campaign by about five-to-one in television ads, the latest poll shows 55% (down 4% from a fortnight ago) support changing the law to allow same-sex couples to marry and 34% (up 3%) are opposed.  But while support for a yes vote has fallen as the no campaign has intensified its efforts to raise concerns about religious freedom, including with public interventions by the former prime minister John Howard, there is a structural upside for the yes campaign – given the postal survey will turn ultimately on efforts to get out the vote in a non-compulsory ballot. People indicating they will definitely vote in the survey are more likely to support same-sex marriage than oppose it and, of the group who have already cast their votes, 59% support same-sex marriage and 37% oppose changing the law. The latest poll of 1,808 respondents indicates 71% of people in favour of same-sex marriage will definitely vote compared with 60% of those opposed. Nine per cent of the Guardian Essential poll sample have already cast their vote and 62% (no change from a fortnight ago) say they will “definitely” vote and 12% (down 4%) will “probably” vote. The poll finds 11% yet to take a position on whether to vote yes or vote no. A clear majority of Labor and Greens supporters are yes voters, while the Coalition cohort is more evenly split, with 47% voting yes, 42% voting no and 12% undecided. Those most in favour of changing the marriage laws are Labor voters (65%), Greens voters (83%), women (62%) and people aged between 18 and 34 (61%). The latest poll shows federal Labor maintaining an election-winning lead over Malcolm Turnbull’s government on the two-party preferred measure – but the gap has narrowed over the past week in the government’s favour. Last week, Labor was ahead of the Coalition on 54% to 46%. This week, Labor is ahead 52% to 48%. The margin of error for the Guardian Essential poll is plus or minus 3%. Survey respondents were also asked a number of questions about climate change and cost of living – with both of those issues featuring in the political debate over energy policy, which dominated the last parliamentary sitting fortnight. There has been an increase since February in the number of Australians agreeing with the statement that climate change is happening and is caused by human activity. A clear majority agrees with that statement, 60% of the sample, up 4% from when the question was last asked in February – while 24% (down 1%) believe we may just be witnessing a normal fluctuation in the Earth’s climate. People under 35 are more likely to have the view that climate change is happening than people over 55 but a majority of the over 55s (54%) also say climate change is happening and is caused by human activity. Voters are also increasingly concerned that not enough is being done to mitigate the risks, with 56% (up 7% since December) believing Australia is not doing enough to address climate change and 20% (down 2%) thinking Australia is doing enough. Young people and people with university-level education are the most concerned about government inaction on climate change. Of the cohort who believe that climate change is happening, 75% think Australia is not doing enough. In making its decision about energy policy over the coming weeks, in political terms, the Turnbull government will have to balance community concerns about climate risks with cost of living pressures and it is clear that rising energy prices are also biting. When it comes to cost of living pressures, people are most concerned about rising electricity and gas bills (46%), followed by housing (34%), medical and dental (25%) and fresh food (21%). Voters aged between 18 and 34 were most concerned about the cost of housing (47%), followed by electricity and gas (42%) and fresh food (25%). People aged between 35 and 54 were more worried about utility bills (52%) than housing (39%) – followed by medical and dental costs (28%). Voters over 55 were also most concerned about costs of electricity and gas (52%) and medical/dental (28%). With slow wages growth also a hot button political issue, as well as a challenge for the Australian economy, 52% of the Guardian Essential sample said they had not had a salary boost in the past 12 months. Thirty-six per cent of workers reported a wage increase in the past year, with 43% of full-time workers and 34% of part-time workers saying they had received a pay increase in the last 12 months. Workers earning higher salaries were also more likely to have had a boost to their pay packet in the past 12 months, with 46% of workers earning $2,000 or more per week saying they had a wage increase compared to 25% of those earning less than $1,000 per week. When asked to reflect on their personal financial situation, 33% of the sample said they were financially comfortable, 43% were “managing” and 20% said they were under financial pressure."
"“It’s a very sorry sight,” says Iain Cameron. It is late August and we are standing in front of Scotland’s very own Sphinx. It never had claws, paws, nor a mysterious countenance, but if it once had they would have melted away, just as the rest is about to do. “Grim,” says Cameron with gravel in his tone.  “It’s pretty much in its death throes.” Sphinx – so-called because of the rock climb directly above it – is a fast disappearing patch of snow situated in the most isolated of the corries in the Cairngorms. We have cycled six miles out from Whitewell near Aviemore along Gleann Eanaich trying to ignore scenery and the loudly blooming heather in our hurry to cover the distance to the slopes of Am Bràigh Riabhach – or Braeriach in the southern tongue – Scotland’s third-highest mountain at 1,296 metres (4,252ft). We scoot past the source of the River Dee with only a glance and a hasty slurp. Even lunch waits until we have plunged gravely over the steep side of Garbh Choire Mòr where our diminishing shrine lies.  Scotland does not have glaciers but usually, each year, a number of resilient patches of snow survive through the summer until they are once again covered by the fresh fall with the arrival of winter. Currently there are three patches left and their demise is imminent. Cameron, Scotland’s leading snow patch expert, says he would expect there to be 50-100 patches left at this time. Last year there were 82, and in the exceptional 2015 there were 678. The ground beneath the Sphinx snow patch has probably seen daylight for less than a few months since the start of the little ice age in the 16th-19th centuries.  This is the closest Scotland comes to having a glacier and makes Sphinx the most permanent and closely studied patch of snow in the British Isles. It has disappeared only a total of six times in the last 300 years: 1933, 1953, 1959, 1996, 2003 and 2006, almost always being the last patch to melt. A select trickle of discerning visitors have made the unlikely pilgrimage to this mountaineers’ sanctuary on the side of Braeriach. The celebrated Scottish naturalist Seton Gordon (1886–1977) came to record and photograph here in October 1910. A few days after our visit, my first and Cameron’s 16th, Cameron intends to bring his tally up to 17 in the company of the stand-up comic Ed Byrne, who happens to be an outdoors enthusiast and respected writer on the topic. When Sphinx disappeared in 1933 it was such an unusual occurrence that a member of the Scottish Mountaineering Club wrote a letter to the Times of London to say that such a thing “had never been known before” and that it was well worth “recording in a paper of record” because it was “unlikely to happen again”.  This late in the season, the snow patches sometimes look like dollops of dead dinosaur on the scree. Their skin-like surface is scalloped with ablation hollows formed by the passage of warm air over the snow creating ridges. These become more pronounced and attract pieces of debris that further accentuate the melting in the hollows. As snow of recent years melts it exposes harder, darker older layers. The 11-year-old hard “firn” at the base will be the last to go. Close by, you can also see the virgin pink of the granite. Even lichens and mosses struggle to get a toehold because the growing season is so short, leaving the granite pink in colour compared to the cliffs above where the same granite is greyer and darker, coloured by plant growth. Even lichens and mosses struggle to get a toehold, leaving the granite pink in colour compared to the darker cliffs The situation was very different last year when we took a similar September trip to the north face of Ben Nevis. There, at an altitude of 1,130 metres (3,707 ft) in Observatory gully, we found not only an enormous patch of snow but a tortoiseshell mini cathedral beneath it. Warm streams hollow out large snow patches from beneath leaving precarious but sculpturally spectacular caverns. If you find one – do not enter. They are highly unstable and very dangerous.  Despite being forever in the mountains it is unlikely Cameron will ever complete all of the Munros – the consequence of a childhood and lifelong fascination with summertime snow. “Year after year I go back to the same mountains, not only that but to the same locations on them, so I am getting to see them in all sorts of moods and atmospheres. I very seldom go to the peak in fact, as the snow tends to sit in the little gullies and corries below the peaks. I go straight to the snow.”  Having avoided the dominant culture of ticking off summits, he is well on the way to instituting an off-beat alternative. Going to highly inaccessible places for no other reason than to observe persistent patches of snow has become a minor social media phenomenon. His Snow Patches of Scotland Facebook page has 1,500 followers. “A multitude of people are now aware of what I do. The more ears and eyes that are out there, the easier my job.” A volunteer group has formed under his leadership which has, since 2008, conducted an annual snow patch survey gathering accurate data for the scientific community that monitors these subtleties of change in climate and environment."
"Asia’s mountain glaciers will lose at least a third of their mass through global warming by the century’s end, with dire consequences for millions of people who rely on them for fresh water, researchers have said. This is a best-case scenario, based on the assumption that the world manages to limit average global warming to 1.5C (2.7F) over pre-industrial levels, a team wrote in the journal Nature.  “To meet the 1.5C target will be a task of unprecedented difficulty,” the researchers said, “and even then, 36% (give or take 7%) of the ice mass in the high mountains of Asia is projected to be lost” by 2100. With warming of 3.5C, 4C and 6C respectively, Asian glacier losses could amount to 49%, 51% or 65% by the end of the century, according to the team’s modelling study. The high mountains of Asia comprise a geographical region surrounding the Tibetan plateau, holding the biggest store of frozen water outside the poles. It feeds many of the world’s great rivers, including the Ganges, the Indus and the Brahmaputra, on which hundreds of millions of people depend. Nearly 200 nations adopted the Paris agreement in 2015, which sets the goal of limiting warming to a level “well below” 2C, while “pursuing efforts” to achieve a lower ceiling of 1.5C. Earth’s surface has already warmed by about 1C, according to scientists. For high warming scenarios, experts predict land-gobbling sea-level rise, worsening storms, more frequent droughts and floods, species loss and disease spread. The Asian high mountains, the new study said, were already warming more rapidly than the global average. A global temperature rise of 1.5C would mean an average increase in the region of about 2.1C, with differences between mountain ranges – all of which will warm by more than 1.5C. The Hindu Kush mountain range would warm by about 2.3C and the eastern Himalayas by 1.9C, the study forecast. “Even if temperatures stabilise at their current level, [glacier] mass loss will continue for decades to come,” the researchers added. For the high mountain glaciers to survive, “it is essential to minimise the global temperature increase”. Swaths of south Asia and China depend on meltwater from Himalayan glaciers for drinking water, electricity generation and irrigation.  At the same time, the regions are also vulnerable to more intense flooding from accelerated glacier melt, combined with heavier rains and superstorms boosted by global warming. A study in July in the journal Nature Climate Change said there was only a 5% chance of holding global warming under 2C. For 1.5C, the odds were about 1%. On current trends, some experts project Earth is on track to warm by about 3C."
"Claims in the Mail on Sunday that global warming data had been exaggerated in order to secure the Paris climate change agreement have been criticised by the UK’s press regulator. The Independent Press Standards Organisation censured the newspaper for publishing a story in early February that was flawed in key aspects. The news story suggested that data from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), one of the world’s gold-standard sources of weather and climate research, had been treated in such a way as to suggest greater warming than had really occurred.  The research hinged on the “pause” in global warming that had been seized on by dismissers of climate change as evidence that the concerns of mainstream scientists had been overblown. The so-called pause or hiatus has long been a contentious issue in climate science. The outlier year of 1998 was exceptionally hot, owing to a strong El Niño, and these record temperatures were not surpassed for several years.  This allowed sceptics to claim that global warming had stopped until 2013. However, as mainstream scientists pointed out, the years following 1998 still exhibited an upward temperature trajectory compared with the long-term average, so while the upward march of temperatures was slightly slower, and some years were cooler than others, talk of a “pause” that suggested an end to global warming was misleading. NOAA published research shortly before the Paris climate change negotiations suggesting the pause was less than had been claimed. Subsequent research backed up NOAA’s findings. The Mail on Sunday article alleged that the NOAA had taken data that was “unverified” and used it to suggest the pause had not happened. Ipso ruled that the Mail on Sunday had “failed to take care over the accuracy of the article and had then failed to correct these significantly misleading statements”. Further, a graph published with the article that purported to show large differences between NOAA’s published data and data on warming from other sources was found to be wrong, owing to the newspaper’s “failure to plot the lines correctly”. Some of these examples were deemed to constitute breaches of the editorial code to which newspapers sign up. David Rose, the author of the original story, frequently writes on global warming, often reporting on sceptics’ views on climate science. He is a respected journalist and won the British Press Awards’ prestigious reporter of the year title for 2015. He writes frequently on issues such as police corruption and miscarriages of justice. Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics, pursued the Ipso claim against the newspaper. He said: “Fake news stories about climate change are a significant threat to the public interest in the UK, US and other countries. The expert community must continue to fight back against the deluge of propaganda from climate change deniers.” He said several other media outlets had repeated the false claims, and they had even been cited in a letter to NOAA from a leading committee chairman in the US Congress. He called the Ipso ruling “a significant victory”. A spokesman for the Mail on Sunday said: “The subject of the rate of climate change is fiercely debated, with reputable scientists taking positions on both sides. The Mail on Sunday has published articles that challenge some widely held opinions. The complainant in this case is a professional spokesman for two academic institutions involved in the debate. He has complained to the press regulator on three previous occasions about our articles on climate change, but those complaints were rejected.” The spokesman added: “This newspaper is fully committed to the principle of independent press regulation and is a member of Ipso. We are disappointed with this finding, but we accept it and are publishing the adjudication with prominence in the newspaper and online.” Not all of the complaints made by Ward against Rose’s article were upheld, and some of those upheld reflected narrow technical points, for instance over the archiving of data."
"Mar-a-Lago. Trump National Doral Miami. Trump Palace. Trump Royale. Trump International Beach Resort Miami. Trump Hollywood.  These Trump-owned or Trump-branded properties are in south Florida, in the path of Hurricane Irma. All are exalted by the Trump Organization and by the president himself. All could be underwater by the end of the century. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) predicts that the sea level will rise in south Florida by as much as 34in by 2050. The Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact says the increase could be up to 81in by 2100. By 2045, according to a risk analysis prepared by Coastal Risk Consulting for the Guardian, the grounds of Mar-a-Lago could be under at least a foot of water for 210 days a year because of increased tidal flooding. The Palm Beach complex, which Trump has begun to call the “winter White House”, is a source of pride for the president. Having described the private resort as the “best club in the world”, he hosted the Japanese prime minister there in February. He also believes Mar-a-Lago has the best meatloaf in America. The main building at Mar-a-Lago will be safe – at least for 30 years – but the flooding will restrict access to the building and impact infrastructure, Coastal Risk Consulting said. The president, who is 71, is unlikely to be around to see that happen. But he could bear witness to repeated flooding of other Trump properties. In just 30 years’ time, the Trump Grande complex in Sunny Isles, Miami – consisting of the Trump Palace and Trump Royale condo buildings and the Trump International Beach Resort hotel – will be experiencing the effects of climate change. The resort could face tidal flooding and storm surges for 97 days a year, while its beaches could be badly affected by erosion. The Trump Hollywood condos, about 12 miles north of Miami, “could be turned into islands” for 140 days a year. Trump’s National Doral golf course is also at risk. In June the Orlando Sentinel reported that sea-level rise and associated flooding could cause severe damage. Even if the course remains intact, flooding would mean fewer days where the National Doral is actually playable. In his book Crippled America – “The rhetoric of this book is both tired and tiring in equal measure,” according to Kings Review – Trump said, without explaining his reasoning, that he does not believe in climate change.  When the Guardian asked him about it in 2015, he would not respond. Trump has previously described the concept of climate change as a “hoax” invented by “the Chinese”. Despite those beliefs, in 2016 Trump applied for planning permission to build a two-mile long wall on the beach next to his golf course in Doonbeg in Ireland. The application said the wall was necessary because of global warming and rising sea levels."

"China, the world’s biggest vehicle market, is considering a ban on the production and sale of fossil fuel cars in a major boost to the production of electric vehicles as Beijing seeks to ease pollution.  The move would follow similar plans announced by France and Britain to outlaw the sale of petrol and diesel cars and vans from 2040 in order to clamp down on harmful emissions. Xin Guobin, vice-minister of industry and information technology, told a forum in the northern city of Tianjin at the weekend that his ministry had started “relevant research” and was working on a timetable for China. Xin said the policy would be implemented “in the near future”, according to the official Xinhua news agency. “These measures will promote profound changes in the environment and give momentum to China’s auto industry development,” he said in remarks broadcast by CCTV state television. “Enterprises should strive to improve the level of energy saving for traditional cars, and vigorously develop new energy vehicles according to assessment requirements,” he said. China produced and sold more than 28m vehicles last year, according to the International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers. The sale of new energy vehicles topped 500,000 in the world’s second-largest economy in 2016, over 50% more than the previous year, according to national industry figures. The government introduced in June a draft regulation to compel vehicle manufacturers to produce more electrically powered vehicles by 2020 through a complex quota system. As the measure looms, foreign vehicle manufacturers have announced plans to boost the production of electric cars in China. Volvo will introduce its first 100% electric car in China in 2019, while Ford will market its first hybrid vehicle early next year and envisions 70% of all its cars available in China will have electric options by 2025."
"Misleading attacks on Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology by climate deniers in the Australian are “debilitating” to the agency and limiting its ability to predict risks and protect the community, the former head of the bureau has told the Guardian. Rob Vertessy, who retired as director of the BoM in April 2016, said climate deniers’ attempts to confuse the public about the science of climate change were dangerous, in an interview for the Guardian’s Planet Oz blog.  “I was exposed to a lot of it and it took up a lot of my time that’s for sure,” Vertessy said. “I feel for my successor and the team at the bureau having to constantly devote energy to this. It’s really quite debilitating.” Vertessy was succeeded by Andrew Johnson, who has since had to deal with a barrage of criticism led by the rightwing thinktank the Institute for Public Affairs and expressed mostly in the pages of the Australian newspaper. Earlier this week, the former Abbott government adviser Maurice Newman accused the bureau of “fabricating temperature records” and said it represented a “smoking gun that threatens the integrity of global temperature records”. Vertessy said these sorts of attacks were dangerous. “From my perspective, people like this running interference on the national weather agency are unproductive and it’s actually dangerous,” he said. “Every minute a BoM executive spends on this nonsense is a minute lost to managing risk and protecting the community and it is a real problem. “As the costs of climate change accumulate in the years ahead, I can see that leaders of this climate change denial movement will really be seen as culpable.” He said the government had done a “pretty good job” of supporting the bureau and independent experts. But he said politicians’ jobs had been made difficult by the Australian. “It will just continue and it will limit the ability of the government to focus on more important matters – not just climate ones but all the works of government. It’s distracting for politicians to have to deal with this chatter.”"

"The deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, has pulled back from a comment he made to the Coalition party room on Tuesday that AGL was “shorting” the market by refusing to sell the ageing Liddell coal-fired power plant to a competitor. Joyce would not repeat the accusation during an interview on Sky News late on Tuesday – but he insisted the company had not provided a reasonable answer to the question of why it would decommission the New South Wales plant if a rival generation company wanted to buy it. “Why pull a plant to pieces if there are people out there who want to buy it,” the deputy prime minister said – adding that he knew two interested parties who were serious buyers. The negative public commentary about AGL’s market behaviour was echoed by the chairman of the Coalition’s backbench committee on energy, Craig Kelly, who said he intended to call the chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, Rod Sims, to ask for an investigation. “There’s an arguable case that AGL are acting in an anti-competitive manner, and I will be calling on the ACCC to investigate,” Kelly told Guardian Australia. The ACCC has expressed public concern about market concentration in power generation and retailing, and is currently inquiring into energy affordability, with an initial report expected late this month. Energy industry players argue power prices are a function of tight gas supply and coal capacity leaving the system, not market manipulation and anti-competitive behaviour. The focus by government MPs on AGL’s market behaviour are part of the Turnbull government’s continuing efforts to strongarm the energy retailer into either selling Liddell, or extending its operating life for another five years – pressure the company is attempting to resist. The company has agreed to give the Turnbull government a plan within 90 days detailing how it will supply the electricity market with reliable power when Liddell is retired in 2022. The public commitment came after a meeting between the AGL chief executive, Andy Vesey, the prime minister, and senior government ministers, in Canberra on Monday, where the company was asked to take a proposal to the board to either sell the plant, or keep it open for another five years. AGL has agreed reluctantly to take that proposal to the board, as well as its own plant to replace Liddell’s current generation capacity with peaking gas and renewables. Energy policy continued to dominate political debate in Canberra on Tuesday, with roiling contention inside the parliament and continued internal ructions inside the Coalition. The former prime minister Tony Abbott, who is an opponent of the clean energy target recommended by Australia’s chief scientist Alan Finkel, told the Coalition party room the government needed to keep its focus on keeping energy affordable. Abbott told colleagues if the government was to add Finkel’s proposed clean energy target to the existing renewable energy target, which peaks in 2020, but tapers out to 2030, that would be a “difficult position to sustain”. The proposed clean energy target remains alive, but will not emerge from the current policy development process in the form Finkel modelled during his inquiry. The government is making it clear the new investment framework, which it wants to resolve before the summer parliamentary recess, will need to be geared to reliability and affordability as well as to emissions reduction. Government players are now talking in more generic terms about an investment mechanism or framework that will deal with a range of issues, while ensuring Australia is on track to meet the Paris climate target. With some Nationals MPs are flat-out opposed to the clean energy target, Joyce said on Tuesday the policy was something that needed to be “negotiated” both inside the government, and between the Liberals and the Nationals. He has previously signalled he would support a clean energy target with a threshold set high enough to allow coal generators to get certificates. The deputy prime minister said the government would need to “land on a target that keeps our base-load power in play”."
"We’ve known for decades that the Earth is warming, but a key question is, how fast? Another key question is whether the warming is primarily caused by human activities. If we can more precisely measure the rate of warming and the natural component, it would be useful for decision makers, legislators, and others to help us adapt and cope. Indeed, added ocean heat content underlies the potential for dangerous intense hurricanes. An answer to the “how fast?” question was partly answered in an Opinion piece just published on Eos.org, the daily online Earth and space science news site, by scientists from China, Europe and the United States. I was fortunate enough to be part of the research team. To measure how fast the globe is warming, we focused on the extra heat that is being trapped in the climate. The key to measuring the extra heat is by comparing the incoming and outgoing energy – just like you watch your bank account, keeping track of income and expenses to tell whether your bank balance will increase or not.  Okay so how do we measure these incoming and outgoing flows? In our view, the best way is in the oceans. We know that the oceans absorb almost all of the excess heat – so, perhaps we can detect energy increases in ocean waters? Measuring the oceans is challenging. They are vast and they are deep – measurements can be noisy. Detecting a long-term trend (a signal) within the noise can be a challenge. But this challenge is exactly what we focused on. We wanted to know how large the signal-to-noise ratio is for ocean heat measurements because this would tell us how many years of data are needed to detect warming. Can we detect global warming with one year of measurements? With a decade? Or do we need multiple decades of measurements to be sure the climate is changing? Our work shows that scientists need less than 4 years of ocean heat measurements to detect a warming signal. This is much shorter than the nearly three decades of measurements that would be required to detect global warming if we were to use temperatures of air near the Earth’s surface. It is also slightly better than the nearly 5 years of sea level rise data that are needed for detecting a long-term trend. This means that the warming is not natural, but rather stems from the human-induced climate change, primarily from increases in heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere. This finding should help change the way we talk about global warming. Normally scientists and the public wait for the official annual “global temperatures” to be released (every January or February) by major research groups like Nasa, Noaa, and the Hadley Centre in the UK. Avid consumers of global warming news often use these air temperatures to “prove” or “disprove” global warming. If it was hot last year, “its global warming!” If last year was cool, “global warming is over!”  But the year-to-year fluctuations of air temperatures are predominantly associated with El Niño and weather variability and mislead those who use any one year as climate-change proof. We saw the impact of fluctuations over the past two decades where a slowing of the rise of global surface temperatures led to false claims that global warming had “stopped” or that there was a “hiatus.” No such cessation occurred for ocean heat content. Hence global ocean heat content data isn’t so noisy. It represents the total thermal energy in the ocean waters, and is now known with a high degree of certainty (see the figure below), in part because scientists have improved ocean temperature sensing methods and increased the number of sensors throughout the ocean waters.  According to our analysis, the top 10 warmest years of ocean heat content are all in the most recent decade (following 2006) with last two years being the hottest. The heat storage in the ocean corresponds to 3×1023 Joules (a 3 with twenty-three zeroes after it) since 1960. Prior to the 1980s, values are not as well known, and the global record is unreliable prior to about 1960. In the most recent 25 years, the Earth has gained approximately 0.7 Watts for every square meter of surface area. That may not sound like much but think about how many square meters are required to cover the surface of the Earth. To put these numbers in perspective, the heat increase in the oceans since 1992 is about 2000 times the total net generation of electricity in the USA in the past decade. We believe, and argue, that ocean heat content is the key to quantifying how fast the climate is changing, and it has important implications for regional patterns of climate. According to Trenberth: A key reason for the exceptionally active Atlantic hurricane season this year is because of the regional build-up of ocean heat along with its global warming component that fuels hurricanes. “Ocean Heat Content” should become a standard metric not only for measuring climate change but for testing our computer models that are used to predict the future climate."

"Emissions from the electricity sector in the three months to June dropped by the biggest amount on record, as the effect of the Hazelwood coal-fired power station closure is seen for the first time in quarterly projections produced exclusively for the Guardian. But even that drop wasn’t enough to stop Australia’s overall greenhouse gas emissions from continuing to rise. Emissions from almost every other sector – industrial energy, transport, industrial heat and agriculture – all rose. They are the highest levels seen since before the carbon tax was repealed, according to projections by consultants at Ndevr Environmental.  The results mean Australia has now consumed 24% of its carbon budget set by the government’s Climate Change Authority – the total amount of carbon it can release from 2013 while doing its fair share to keep global warming under 2C. Once a certain amount of carbon goes into the atmosphere, warming over 2C will be inevitable. The report replicates the government’s methodology for its National Greenhouse Gas Inventory quarterly reports, which the government traditionally delays releasing for up to nine months, and has in the past saved up and released quietly in a batch just before Christmas. Australia’s overall greenhouse gas emissions over the year to June 2017 were the highest since 2011, with emissions rising steadily since the carbon tax was repealed in 2014. The most recent quarter – the three months to June 2017 – also had the highest emissions for any June quarter since 2011, rising to 3m tonnes more than the same quarter last year.  However, emissions from electricity dropped significantly, by about 4.3m tonnes compared with the previous quarter, or about 2m tonnes compared with the June quarter last year. The drop was mostly due to the closure on 1 April of the Hazelwood power station, which was Australia’s most polluting generator. Increased generation from Snowy Hydro in the quarter also contributed to the lower emissions from the electricity sector, said Stephen Christos from Ndevr Environmental. But that reduction was overwhelmed by other sectors, which all increased or stayed stable.  The most notable increase was in the “stationary energy” sector, which includes fuel burned for heat and energy in industry other than electricity. Emissions for stationary energy were the second-highest on record in the most recent quarter’s projections, having risen steeply over the past year. Among the significant factors pushing up the emissions in stationary energy are the three huge LNG production and export facilities in Queensland, which are also responsible for Australia’s tight and expensive domestic gas market. The liquefying and exporting of huge volumes of Australia’s gas has left the domestic market with relatively little gas, pushing up costs for consumers. The drop in emissions from electricity over the past 12 months was cancelled out by the increase in emissions from stationary energy, with electricity dropping by 5.3m tonnes and stationary energy growing by 5.8m tonnes. Transport emissions also rose significantly – by more than 2.2m tonnes above the same quarter last year.  The results are drawing Australia further from its carbon reduction targets made after the Paris climate agreement, which was adopted in December 2015. Compared with a hypothetical situation where Australia cut its emissions linearly from when they were made according to its commitment, Australia’s most recent quarterly emissions are now exceeding its Paris commitments by 5.53m tonnes, and exceeding the science-based cuts recommended by the Climate Change Authority by 14.74m tonnes."
"Which living person has done most to destroy the natural world and the future wellbeing of humanity? Donald Trump will soon be the correct answer, when the full force of his havoc has been felt. But for now I would place another name in the frame: Angela Merkel. What? Have I lost my mind? Angela Merkel, the “climate chancellor”? The person who, as German environment minister, brokered the first UN climate agreement, through sheer force of will? The chancellor who persuaded the G7 leaders to promise to phase out fossil fuels by the end of this century? The architect of Germany’s Energiewende – its famous energy transition? Yes, the very same. Unlike Trump, she has no malicious intent. She did not set out to destroy the agreements she helped to create. But the Earth’s systems do not respond to mission statements or speeches or targets. They respond to hard fact. What counts, and should be judged, as she seeks a fourth term as German chancellor in the elections on Sunday, is what is done, not what is said. On this metric, her performance has been a planetary disaster. Merkel has a fatal weakness: a weakness for the lobbying power of German industry. Whenever a crucial issue needs to be resolved, she weighs her ethics against political advantage, and chooses the advantage. This, in large part, is why Europe now chokes in a fug of diesel fumes. The EU decision to replace petrol engines with diesel, though driven by German car manufacturers, predates her premiership. It was a classic European fudge, a means of averting systemic change while creating an impression of action, based on the claim (which now turns out to be false) that diesel engines produce less carbon dioxide than petrol. But once she became chancellor, Merkel used every conceivable tactic, fair and foul, to preserve this deadly cop-out. The worst instance was in 2013, when, after five years of negotiations, other European governments had finally agreed a new fuel economy standard for cars: they would produce an average of no more than 95g of CO2 per km by 2020. Merkel moved in to close the whole thing down. She is alleged to have threatened the then president of the European council, Irish taoiseach Enda Kenny, with the cancellation of Ireland’s bailout funds. She told the Netherlands and Hungary the German car plants in their countries would be closed. She struck a filthy deal with David Cameron, offering to frustrate European banking regulations if he helped her to block the fuel regulations. Through these brutal strategies, she managed to derail the agreement. The €700,000 donation her party then received from the major shareholders in BMW does not suggest they were unhappy with what she had achieved. In 2014, the European commission wrote to the German government, warning that the air pollution caused by diesel engines was far higher than its manufacturers were claiming. The government ignored the warning. Even now, two years after the dieselgate scandal broke, Merkel has continued to defend diesel engines, announcing that “we will use all our power to prevent” German cities from banning them, and stifling the transition to electric cars. The “mistake” made by the diesel manufacturers, she insists, “doesn’t give us the right to deprive the entire industry of its future”. Instead, her policy deprives thousands of people of their lives. But this could be the least of the environmental disasters she has engineered. For this lethal concession to German car companies was predated by an even worse one, in 2007. In that case, her blunt refusal – supported by the usual diplomatic bullying – to accept proposed improvements in engine standards forced the European commission to find another means of reducing greenhouse gases. It chose, disastrously, to replace fossil fuel with biofuels, a switch Merkel has vociferously defended. Merkel and the European commission ignored repeated warnings that the likely consequences would include malnutrition and massive environmental destruction, as land was converted from forests or food crops to fuel production. The European biofuel rule is now a major driver of one of the world’s greatest environmental disasters: the razing of the Indonesian rainforests and their replacement with oil palm. While greenhouse gas emissions in other European nations have fallen sharply, in Germany they have plateaued Not only has this wiped out vast and magnificent ecosystems, and the orangutans, tigers, rhinos, gibbons and thousands of other species they supported; but it has also, by burning trees and oxidising peat, caused emissions far higher than those produced by fossil fuels. What makes this history especially bitter is that the target she derailed in 2007 was the one that had first been proposed, in 1994, by a German environment minister called – let me think – ah yes, Angela Merkel. Is this the worst? It is hard to rank such crimes against the biosphere, but perhaps the most embarrassing is Germany’s shocking failure, despite investing hundreds of billions of euros, to decarbonise its electricity system. While greenhouse gas emissions in other European nations have fallen sharply, in Germany they have plateaued. The reason is, once more, Merkel’s surrender to industrial lobbyists. Her office has repeatedly blocked the environment ministry’s efforts to set a deadline for an end to coal power. Coal, especially lignite, which vies with Canadian tar sands for the title of the world’s dirtiest fuel, still supplies 40% of Germany’s electricity. Because Merkel refuses to restrict its use, the peculiar impact of Germany’s Energiewende programme has been to cut the price of electricity, stimulating a switch from natural gas to lignite, which is cheaper. (In Germany they call this the Energiewende paradox). But Merkel doesn’t seem to care. She has announced that “coal will remain a pillar of German energy supply for a prolonged time span”. Shouldn’t the European emissions trading system have sorted this out, pricing coal power out of the market? Yes, it should. But it was sabotaged in 2006 by a German politician, who insisted that so many permits be issued to industry that the price fell through the floor. I think you can probably guess who. All these are real impacts, while the paper agreements she helped to broker have foundered and dissipated as a result of special favours and dirty deals of the kind I have listed in this article. Yet still she attracts an aura of sanctity. This is quite an achievement, for the world’s leading environmental vandal. • George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist"
"Theresa May has issued a veiled warning to Donald Trump, arguing that his plan to withdraw from the Paris climate change treaty ranks alongside North Korea’s nuclear missile tests as a threat to global prosperity and security. In a speech to the United Nations general assembly, the prime minister, whose authority at home has been severely tested since June’s general election result, sought to project her vision of a “rules-based” international order. She said global cooperation was the only way to confront shared international challenges, including terrorism, climate change, and mass movements of refugees – and condemned countries that fail to play by the rules. The prime minister did not name the US president directly but made clear that she believed ongoing membership of the Paris climate change accord was as important as the nuclear non-proliferation treaty in maintaining global security.  “As the global system struggles to adapt, we are confronted by states deliberately flouting – for their own gain – the rules and standards that have secured our collective prosperity and security,” she said. She singled out Russia, Syria and North Korea for direct condemnation, but described the climate change treaty as part of the “rules-based system” that protects global peace and security. “It is the fundamental values that we share, values of fairness, justice and human rights, that have created the common cause between nations to act together in our shared interest and form the multilateral system. “And it is this rules-based system which we have developed – including the institutions, the international frameworks of free and fair trade, agreements such as the Paris climate change accord, and laws and conventions like the non-proliferation treaty – which enables the global co-operation through which we can protect those values.” She warned that undermining these international institutions, including the UN, ultimately threatened states’ national interests. “If this system we have created is found no longer to be capable of meeting the challenges of our time, then there will be a crisis of faith in multilateralism and global cooperation that will damage the interests of all our peoples.” The prime minister was the first world leader to visit Trump in the White House, brushing off concerns in some European capitals about his unpredictability.  But she has repeatedly expressed concern about his decision to seek to renegotiate the Paris treaty, and a planned state visit to the UK has been indefinitely postponed, amid fears of public protests. She delivered the speech just an hour before she was due to meet Trump for a bilateral meeting in a New York hotel. In his own speech to the UN general assembly on Tuesday, the US president described the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, as “rocket man”, and threatened to “totally destroy” Kim’s country if it did not rein in its nuclear ambitions. May issued her own strongly worded condemnation of North Korea’s actions, but stopped short of threatening military action.  “Time after time he has shown contempt for the international community of law-abiding states,” she said of Kim Jong-un. “Contempt for his neighbours. And contempt for the institutions and rules that have preserved peace and security.  “On this challenge the UN has in recent weeks shown it can step up to the task, with last Monday’s security council resolution creating the biggest sanctions package of the 21st century. We have seen regional and global powers coming together and – as in its founding charter – putting aside limited self-interest to show leadership on behalf of the wider world.” She also criticised Russia for using its veto on the UN security council to block tougher action against Syria for using chemical weapons on civilians. “One country in particular has used its veto as many times in the last five years as in the whole of the second half of the cold war. And in so doing they have prevented action against a despicable regime that has murdered its own people with chemical weapons,” she said. May was applauded when she recounted the terrorist attacks in London and Manchester earlier this year, and said: “The terrorists did not win, for we will never let anyone destroy our way of life.” The prime minister’s trip to New York has been overshadowed by speculation about Boris Johnson’s future, after the foreign secretary wrote a 4,000-word article for the Daily Telegraph that appeared to set out a distinctive vision for Brexit. But on Wednesday night her spokesman said Johnson had changed plans and would fly back to London alongside May on the prime minister’s RAF ­Voyager jet to attend a specially convened meeting of the ­cabinet, where she hopes her colleagues will back her on Brexit. Her UN address, delivered as she prepares for a major speech on Brexit in Florence on Friday, was aimed at presenting Britain as a free-trading, outward-looking country that would continue to play its role in the world. May also urged the UN to reform, and repeated a pledge by her international development secretary, Priti Patel, that Britain would withhold up to 30% of its £90m a year core funding to the UN, unless it could meet performance targets showing that it was delivering value for money. “Throughout its history the UN has suffered from a seemingly unbridgeable gap between the nobility of its purposes and the effectiveness of its delivery,” May said. “When the need for multilateral action has never been greater, the shortcomings of the UN and its institutions risk undermining the confidence of states as members and donors.  “Even more importantly, they risk the confidence and faith of those who rely upon the blue helmets; who rely upon that sign I stand in front of today coming to their aid in the darkest of hours.” After delivering her speech, May went straight to the bilateral meeting with Trump, at the Lotte New York Palace hotel. Seated in front of US and UK flags, Trump said: “We will be doing a lot of trading with the UK and we look forward to it.” May said: “We’ve had many discussions between our representatives and ourselves on a whole variety of issues – including trade, which is important for us, and some other policy issues – and our security and defence relationship, which of course is the closest we have.” The prime minister used the meeting as an opportunity to lobby Trump over the importance of preserving jobs at aerospace giant Bombardier in Northern Ireland, and to press the president over the importance of the international nuclear deal with Iran, which he has threatened to tear up. "
"President Donald Trump’s top economic adviser said at the United Nations on Monday the US has not changed its plans to withdraw from the Paris climate pact without a renegotiation favorable to Washington, a step for which there is little appetite in the international community. Trump in June announced his decision to withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement, saying it would put US industries at a disadvantage, cost jobs, weaken American national sovereignty and put the country at a permanent disadvantage to the other countries of the world. “We made the president’s position unambiguous, to where the president stands, where the administration stands on Paris,” Gary Cohn said after the informal breakfast meeting with ministers from about a dozen countries on the sidelines of the annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations.  In a statement issued after the meeting, a White House official said: “We are withdrawing from the Paris agreement unless we can re-engage on terms more favorable to the United States. This position was made very clear during the breakfast.” US officials attended a Montreal meeting on Saturday of ministers from more than 30 of the nations that signed the climate change agreement. The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump administration officials had said Washington would not pull out of the agreement and had offered to re-engage.  “There was some confusion over the weekend and I think we removed all the confusion,” Cohn, director of the National Economic Council, told reporters, adding that he was referring to the meeting in Montreal. The secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, said on Sunday that the US could remain in the Paris climate accord under the right conditions.  Cohn, who is overseeing the issue for Trump, on Monday declined to elaborate on suitable terms that the US would consider to remain in the climate change pact.  “The mood was good,” Cohn said of the meeting. “Very constructive. Everyone wants to work together. Everyone wants to understand everyone’s position. I think everyone has a understanding where we all want to get to.”"
"A gargantuan truck fills the driveway of Tori Amos’s Cornwall home. The surrounding countryside is tranquil – verdant hills, stone farm buildings, golden crops swaying in the late August sun – but a throng of activity greets us at the home/recording studio Amos shares with her producer husband, Mark Hawley. The van and attending crew, she says, curled up on the sofa in her library, are here to collect one of her beloved Bösendorfer pianos for an impending European tour. “She’s being put in her case,” explains Amos. “Hopefully with a nice blanket.” Amos was raised in Maryland, a Led Zeppelin-loving daughter of a minister, and self-taught pianist who would jilt both church and conservatoire to forge her own sound in the 90s: wildly original, taboo-busting piano pop. She cut through grunge’s squall, playing two, sometimes three, piano keyboards simultaneously, while wearing 7in stilettos. Her music is celebrated enough to warrant the occasional benevolent ribbing – the animated series Bob’s Burgers recently had an Amos-esque woman using lyrics about an oil spill as a metaphor for her vagina – and has been an indelible influence on today’s musicians, acknowledged by Taylor Swift, Perfume Genius and Annie “St Vincent” Clark.  Native Invader, released this week, is Amos’s 15th studio album, some 25 years on from her solo debut Little Earthquakes. She is feeling “fortunate, blessed” about this benchmark. “But writing is still nerve-racking, mostly because I’m waiting for the muses to turn up.” She has jump-started the process in previous years; a penchant for hallucinogens, for example, is well documented. “Oh, I haven’t done those in a while,” says the 54-year-old. “I’m leaving that to the youth now.” Those 18-hour-long ayahuasca trips could be heavy going, says Amos, but nothing tested her creativity quite like the menopause. “That’s the harshest teacher I’ve met; harsher than fame. I was in the thick of it during [her 2014 album] Unrepentant Geraldines. But I’m on the other side of it now,” she smiles. “I can see possibilities again.” The “muses” saved her, but they took an age to show up. “And when they weren’t there, I was a stranger to myself.” It was a trip through the Great Smoky Mountains, her late Cherokee grandfather’s ancestral lands, last autumn that grounded her. Trekking through the Appalachian sub-range (a stretch that bridges North Carolina and Tennessee), she imagined her “Poppa” as a boy, treading those same routes. “In that moment, we shared something; seeds were planted. I didn’t recognise them at the time, though. It was very humbling.” Poppa’s influence runs deep on Native Invader, peaking in the urgent thrum of the album’s standout single, Up the Creek. When she was a girl, Poppa taught her about songlines – the sacred navigational paths of the indigenous folk. “We’d take walks. He’d smoke his pipe, tell me his people’s stories. There was no fanfare to it. I just drank it all in, like a weed.” Lineage and land, then, are dovetailing influences on this album. Resilience, too, the environmental kind – climate change hangs heavy – and the psychological, both in the face of Trump-era chaos. In the US last year, while working on a song for the Netflix teen drama Audrie & Daisy, Amos experienced the poison he has spread first-hand. “I remember flying into Florida and sitting next to a woman who chanted, ‘Lock her up!’ the whole way there. Oh! Such hate,” she says. “After that, I began to see the polarities; people unfriending family members on Facebook …” The schisms bore an unsettling similarity to Poppa’s accounts of post-civil war life, gleaned from his mother, Little Margaret, a formidable, tomahawk-wielding matriarch who had evaded the forced relocation of Native Americans by means of taking refuge in the Smokies. “I remember Poppa telling me how cousins would fight cousins, how some families still hadn’t healed, a hundred or so years later. The similarities terrified me. I cocooned myself there for a minute, and the muses weren’t coming.” In January, Amos’s 88-year-old mother, Mary Ellen, had a stroke, “and everything changed”. Before the attack, which has left Mary unable to speak and requiring round-the-clock care, mother and daughter had spoken often. About the election? “About everything.” Doctors say it’s difficult to assess the damage, “but I believe she’s still with us,” says Amos gently. “She remembers songs, certain hymns, the Beatles’ Penny Lane. She was, is, such a believer that all things can be healed by taking a walk; that all the answers are there, in nature. To see Mary under attack from this stroke, and to see America herself, Lady Liberty, under attack – it’s a terrible parallel.” Matriarchal power – in deities, myths, archetypes – has been a perpetual touchstone in Amos’s work, and is still present; I notice a pack of tarot-like Goddess Oracle cards on her library desk. Post-menopause, she is discovering a “different kind of fertility” in her work. She is honouring Gaia, and pulling no punches when it comes to naming the would-be architects of her destruction: “Those pimps in Washington, raping the land,” she sings on Benjamin, a track on the new album. “I think mother earth is being incredibly resilient against a government that seems hell-bent on exploiting her resources,” she says. “So she is under attack, and yet, when I walk in her bounty, I don’t get the sense that she’s giving up, or defeated. I do sense that [feeling] in people though.” She says that paranoia and fear permeated the tours for her post-9/11 album, Scarlet’s Walk, but she’d encountered the “smell, the taste” of political influence, years before, playing to piano bar lobbyist crowds in Georgetown, Washington, throughout her teens. “I was at a very impressionable age, performing for people making huge backroom decisions about the country. That was back when [Trump’s Supreme Court appointee] Neil Gorsuch’s mother was head of the Environmental Protection Agency. Iran-Contra; Weinberger – I played through all of that.” Remaining creative in the face of the machine, she says, is vital. “You can’t beat a bully at his own games. And I’m not talking about one particular bully here; it’s energy. You have to out-create the destruction – it’s the only way.” But first, says Amos, the US must face its shame: its crimes against the First Nations, from Andrew Jackson’s 1830 Indian Removal Act to the bulldozers that crushed the Standing Rock protests this February. “I’m not in a position to speak for First Nation people – that’s a sacred task. But, as an observer, it seems to me that, unlike Germany, we’ve never had to really face our holocaust. Until we do that, the healing can’t begin.” In the Smokies, she encountered locals who were oblivious to the land’s fraught history and had no idea they were inhabiting sacred songline territory. The ignorance she encountered stunned her and left her meditating on her own complicated lineage: a family tree that includes both Native Americans and Confederate soldiers. It was Amos’s physician sister, Marie Amos Dobyns, a member of the Association of American Indian Physicians, who prompted the pilgrimage. “Marie’s a big believer in championing the voiceless; I didn’t truly understand that until Mary lost hers.” Dobyns has forged deep friendships in the Native-American medicine communities over the years, says Amos, kinships she has been generous enough to share with Amos. “I call them the ‘Seattle sweat lodge sisters’. There’s nothing I’ve experienced like [sitting in a sweat lodge with them]; you feel so nurtured, so given to. But there’s a nakedness, a vulnerability, you have to bring to it in order to receive that.” Vulnerability – men’s, in particular – is tackled compassionately on the Native Invader song Wings: “Sometimes, big boys, they need to cry.” Is she referencing anyone in particular here? “Oh, I see it all around me: in my marriage, in my crew.” Men can spend hours gabbing in the pub, Amos says, without ever articulating their feelings. When, I wonder, did Trump last cry? Would we all be safer from the epidemic of toxic white masculinity – Charlottesville, Dylann Roof, “fire and fury” – if men could own their fragility? “Listen, we have all heard men being called a certain female body part when they cry. And we all know the real power of that body part; talk about a multitasker! Emotional vulnerability takes bravery. Great male leaders through the ages have understood this.” Trump’s most bilious voters – the ones who invoke God’s name with white hoods and burning crosses – are anything but brave, says Amos, and definitely not true, compassionate Christians. As a former Jesus groupie, or “recovering Christian” as her Boys for Pele-era tour T-shirts touted, Amos is uniquely qualified to know. “Some of Mary’s carers, they really walk the walk. They practise their faith on a daily basis and they glow with it. Mary had – has – that glow, that containment, too. But she’s got a fight on her hands now, to stay on the planet.” On her impending tour, how will Amos endure the miles between mother and daughter? Will she cut things short should the worst happen? “It’s day-to-day right now,” she says, after a long, heavy pause. “I’ve been doing music since I was two and a half; it’s the thing that makes sense to me.” And yet, at her peak, Amos didn’t always make sense to her critics. In the 90s, her genius was frequently couched in misogynistic backhanders by the music press: she was a “weird chick” in Q; a “Grade-A, class-one, turbo-driven fruitcake” in the NME. “And they weren’t all men, those critics,” Amos points out wryly. But she persisted, and here she is now, 15 albums in – still touring, still creating, still defiant."
"Reading Australian James Bradley’s “cli-fi” novel as large areas of Asia and Texas are flooded ramps up the disturbing effect of its incrementally apocalyptic scenarios. Bird die-offs, mass fish deaths, wildfires and storms are just the beginning as Bradley zooms into the future via a sequence of linked narratives. The “clade” of the title is the set of all the descendants of Adam Leith, a climatologist; each chapter focuses on the next generation of Adam’s family (and naturally his name has symbolic resonance), enabling Bradley’s predictions for Earth to fast-forward at Koyaanisqatsi-like speed while the human actors replay their inherited traits of awkwardness, poor communication skills and attachment issues. The structure, at once intimate and epic, works well as a means of delivering human-scale stories against the backdrop of the most human story of all: our heedless despoiling of the home planet. Almost inevitably, there is something of the blockbuster movie about this: the beleaguered family battling to stay together as the world ends. But Bradley’s deft merging of near-future predictions and cutting-edge science into a convincing setting for his family drama enables us to focus on the interactions between the characters. The apocalypse is happening, even as our messed-up lives distract us. • Clade is published by Titan. To order a copy for £6.79 (RRP £7.99) go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846.

"It is not only Donald Trump’s government that censors the discussion of climate change; it is the entire body of polite opinion. This is why, though the links are clear and obvious, most reports on Hurricane Harvey have made no mention of the human contribution to it. In 2016 the US elected a president who believes that human-driven global warming is a hoax. It was the hottest year on record, in which the US was hammered by a series of climate-related disasters. Yet the total combined coverage for the entire year on the evening and Sunday news programmes on ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox News amounted to 50 minutes. Our greatest predicament, the issue that will define our lives, has been blotted from the public’s mind. Almost certainly, according to a statement issued by the World Meteorological Organization on Tuesday. “Climate change means that when we do have an event like Harvey, the rainfall amounts are likely to be higher than they would have been otherwise,” the UN organisation’s spokeswoman Clare Nullis told a conference. Nobody is arguing that climate change caused the storm, but it is likely to have made it much worse. Warmer seas evaporate more quickly. Warmer air holds more water vapour. So, as temperatures rise around the world, the skies store more moisture and dump it more intensely. The US National Weather Service has had to introduce a new colour on its graphs to deal with the volume of precipitation. Harvey surpassed the previous US record for rainfall from a tropical system, as 49.2 inches was recorded at Mary’s Creek at Winding Road in Southeast Houston, at 9.20am on Tuesday. There is a proven link – known as the Clausius-Clapeyron equation – that shows that for every half a degree celsius in warming, there is about a 3% increase in atmospheric moisture content. This was a factor in Texas. The surface temperature in the Gulf of Mexico is currently more than half a degree celsius higher than the recent late summer average, which is in turn more than half a degree higher than 30 years ago, according to Michael Mannof Penn State University. As a result there was more potential for a deluge. Yes, the storm surge was greater because sea levels have risen 20cm as a result of more than 100 years of human-related global warming. This has melted glaciers and thermally expanded the volume of seawater. This is not an accident. But nor (with the exception of Fox News) is it likely to be a matter of policy. It reflects a deeply ingrained and scarcely conscious self-censorship. Reporters and editors ignore the subject because they have an instinct for avoiding trouble. To talk about climate breakdown (which in my view is a better term than the curiously bland labels we attach to this crisis) is to question not only Trump, not only current environmental policy, not only current economic policy – but the entire political and economic system. It is to expose a programme that relies on robbing the future to fuel the present, that demands perpetual growth on a finite planet. It is to challenge the very basis of capitalism; to inform us that our lives are dominated by a system that cannot be sustained – a system that is destined, if it is not replaced, to destroy everything. To claim there is no link between climate breakdown and the severity of Hurricane Harvey is like claiming there is no link between the warm summer we have experienced and the end of the last ice age. Every aspect of our weather is affected by the fact that global temperatures rose by about 4C between the ice age and the 19th century. And every aspect of our weather is affected by the 1C of global warming caused by human activities. While no weather event can be blamed solely on human-driven warming, none is unaffected by it. We know that the severity and impact of hurricanes on coastal cities is exacerbated by at least two factors: higher sea levels, caused primarily by the thermal expansion of seawater; and greater storm intensity, caused by higher sea temperatures and the ability of warm air to hold more water than cold air. Before it reached the Gulf of Mexico, Harvey had been demoted from a tropical storm to a tropical wave. But as it reached the Gulf, where temperatures this month have been far above average, it was upgraded first to a tropical depression, then to a category one hurricane. It might have been expected to weaken as it approached the coast, as hurricanes churn the sea, bringing cooler waters to the surface. But the water it brought up from 100 metres and more was also unusually warm. By the time it reached land, Harvey had intensified to a category four hurricane. We were warned about this. In June, for instance, Robert Kopp, a professor of Earth sciences, predicted: “In the absence of major efforts to reduce emissions and strengthen resilience, the Gulf Coast will take a massive hit. Its exposure to sea-level rise – made worse by potentially stronger hurricanes – poses a major risk to its communities.” To raise this issue, I’ve been told on social media, is to politicise Hurricane Harvey. It is an insult to the victims and a distraction from their urgent need. The proper time to discuss it is when people have rebuilt their homes, and scientists have been able to conduct an analysis of just how great the contribution from climate breakdown might have been. In other words, talk about it only when it’s out of the news. When researchers determined, nine years on, that human activity had made a significant contribution to Hurricane Katrina, the information scarcely registered. I believe it is the silence that’s political. To report the storm as if it were an entirely natural phenomenon, like last week’s eclipse of the sun, is to take a position. By failing to make the obvious link and talk about climate breakdown, media organisations ensure our greatest challenge goes unanswered. They help push the world towards catastrophe. Hurricane Harvey offers a glimpse of a likely global future; a future whose average temperatures are as different from ours as ours are from those of the last ice age. It is a future in which emergency becomes the norm, and no state has the capacity to respond. It is a future in which, as a paper in the journal Environmental Research Letters notes, disasters like Houston’s occur in some cities several times a year. It is a future that, for people in countries such as Bangladesh, has already arrived, almost unremarked on by the rich world’s media. It is the act of not talking that makes this nightmare likely to materialise. In Texas, the connection could scarcely be more apparent. The storm ripped through the oil fields, forcing rigs and refineries to shut down, including those owned by some of the 25 companies that have produced more than half the greenhouse gas emissions humans have released since the start of the Industrial Revolution. Hurricane Harvey has devastated a place in which climate breakdown is generated, and in which the policies that prevent it from being addressed are formulated. Like Trump, who denies human-driven global warming but who wants to build a wall around his golf resort in Ireland to protect it from the rising seas, these companies, some of which have spent millions sponsoring climate deniers, have progressively raised the height of their platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, in response to warnings about higher seas and stronger storms. They have grown from 40ft above sea level in 1940, to 70ft in the 1990s, to 91ft today. This is not, however, a story of mortal justice. In Houston, as everywhere else, it is generally the poorer communities, least responsible for the problem, who are hit first and hit worst. But the connection between cause and effect should appeal to even the slowest minds. The problem is not confined to the US. Across the world, the issue that hangs over every aspect of our lives is marginalised, except on the rare occasions where world leaders gather to discuss it in sombre tones (then sombrely agree to do almost nothing), whereupon the instinct to follow the machinations of power overrides the instinct to avoid a troubling subject. When they do cover the issue, they tend to mangle it. In the UK, the BBC this month again invited the climate-change denier Nigel Lawson on to the Today programme, in the mistaken belief that impartiality requires a balance between correct facts and false ones. The broadcaster seldom makes such a mess of other topics, because it takes them more seriously. When Trump’s enforcers instruct officials and scientists to purge any mention of climate change from their publications, we are scandalised. But when the media does it, without the need for a memo, we let it pass. This censorship is invisible even to the perpetrators, woven into the fabric of organisations that are constitutionally destined to leave the major questions of our times unasked. To acknowledge this issue is to challenge everything. To challenge everything is to become an outcast. • George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist"
"As recovery begins on the islands of the Caribbean and Florida braces itself for an onslaught, Irma has stormed into the record books as the most powerful hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean.  But such weather systems are far from a rarity. Hurricanes are a type of storm known as a tropical cyclone, which build from warm, moist air over the oceans.  Water evaporates, leaving behind a region of low pressure, which is then filled by surrounding air, explains Adrian Champion, an expert in climate systems from the University of Exeter. This causes more “new” warm air to rise into the cyclone, he explains. As this warm, moist air cools, it forms clouds, releasing energy back into the cyclone, helping it to develop.  Such systems form in the tropics as the water is warmer than elsewhere, therefore more easily evaporated. The “spin” of the hurricane is down to the rotation of the Earth affecting the movement of the air: since Irma formed north of the equator, it spins anticlockwise. Many different factors can cause the system to build. “What causes it to intensify [beyond a standard cyclone] is either that the ocean is unusually warm or there is further instability [such as strong winds] in the atmosphere,” said Champion. Depending on where these systems strike, they are given different names. “If they hit the Americas then they are called hurricanes, if they hit Asia they are called typhoons and if they hit Africa and Australia they are called cyclones,” said Champion.  But it is when these severe storms head towards land that interest generally gathers pace – a factor that has led to hurricanes and other tropical cyclones being given specific monikers to avoid confusion and help the public and the media to share information. The names themselves are allocated based on a system devised by the World Meteorological Organization – if a tropical cyclone is particularly deadly, as in the case of Hurricane Katrina, its handle will not be used again. The strength of a hurricane is marked by its category on what is known as the Saffir-Simpson scale, which reflects the wind speeds – and hence the level of damage expected once the cyclone strikes land.  While category 1 hurricanes are serious, expected to damage rooftops and bring down trees with wind speeds between 74 and 95mph, Hurricane Irma was initially at the top end of the scale, meeting criteria for a category 5 hurricane: winds of 157mph or more, catastrophic damage, power outages that could last for many weeks, and areas of land rendered uninhabitable for months.  But drastic though Irma is, one thing is for sure: the storm will pass. “The big thing is [hurricanes] only have this energy supply when they are over the oceans,” said Champion. “When they hit landfall they weaken and die away.”"
"Recent days have seen Houston, Texas literally sunk under sheer weight of rain, Carribbean islands battered by powerful storms barrelling across the Gulf and now Florida homes blasted by Irma, the largest of three hurricanes churning in the Atlantic basin. It seems almost certain that man-made climate change has a role in such events. Scientists used to be circumspect at attributing any single extreme event to global warming. No longer. Now scientists make the link between climate change and droughts in Kenya, record winter sun in Britain and torrential downpours in south-west China.  The unmistakeable fingerprint of extreme weather at the crime scene of global warming seems intuitively obvious: consider that Houston is reckoned to have been hit by three “500-year floods” in three years. A 500-year flood does not have to happen only twice a millennium. But a run of three indicates that past climate is no longer a reliable guide to the present weather. The explanation is that the climate itself is changing.  Such thinking should be a wake up call for the world, which has to understand how profoundly we must make a shift in the way we produce, distribute and consume energy, and how disruptive this will be for the real economy. While governments have, via the Paris agreement, signalled the end of the fossil-fuel era, the political processes by which states will decide how to meet their mitigation targets have been hijacked and influenced by Big Carbon. Fossil-fuel companies, hydrocarbon billionaires and their allies, particularly in the west, have for years now been funding a massive and sophisticated campaign to mislead voters about the environmental harm caused by carbon pollution. They have good reason to: a landmark study released earlier this year revealed 50 corporations account for more than one-fifth of all carbon released into the atmosphere since the industrial revolution began. The groundbreaking research not only helps establish legal accountability for climate change, it also weakens any corporate defence of wilful blindness. A major polluter cannot say it was going ahead with its activities because it was unaware its products caused great harm. Corporations have made handsome profits as the globe ended up a degree warmer than it should be. These polluters privatised the fossil-fuel profits and socialised the cost to the world’s poor, global taxpayers and future generations. Big Carbon entities and individuals who claim their lobbying activities are just an expression of their democratic rights sound a lot like Big Tobacco when it was denying the health dangers of smoking. Three major legal actions will test such thinking. First in the Philippines, where it is being determined whether polluters violated the human rights of Filipinos for their role in creating the conditions for Typhoon Haiyan, the strongest ever tropical storm to make landfall, which left more than 7,000 dead. Second in Germany, where a German utility company is being sued for costs associated with glacial lake flooding in Peru. Last in the US, where two California counties are suing 37 oil, gas and coal companies, claiming they knew their products would cause sea-level rise and coastal flooding, but failed to reduce their greenhouse gases. Fossil-fuel companies should be held accountable for the effects of climate change. Legal warfare has a two-fold aim: to overhaul transgressors’ business models so that they are in line with the global commitment to phase out fossil fuels and limit temperature rises to 1.5°C; and to get them to pay for damages resulting from global warming. Climate litigation is the inevitable result of a failure of two decades of talks. But it is also an important way of reframing the climate crisis as a human rights emergency."

"Many of us share some dim apprehension that the world is flying out of control, that the centre cannot hold. Raging wildfires, once-in-1,000-years storms and lethal heatwaves have become fixtures of the evening news – and all this after the planet has warmed by less than 1C above preindustrial temperatures. But here’s where it gets really scary. If humanity burns through all its fossil fuel reserves, there is the potential to warm the planet by as much as 18C and raise sea levels by hundreds of feet. This is a warming spike of an even greater magnitude than that so far measured for the end-Permian mass extinction. If the worst-case scenarios come to pass, today’s modestly menacing ocean-climate system will seem quaint. Even warming to one-fourth of that amount would create a planet that would have nothing to do with the one on which humans evolved or on which civilisation has been built. The last time it was 4C warmer there was no ice at either pole and sea level was 80 metres higher than it is today.  I met University of New Hampshire paleoclimatologist Matthew Huber at a diner near his campus in Durham, New Hampshire. Huber has spent a sizable portion of his research career studying the hothouse of the early mammals and he thinks that in the coming centuries we might be heading back to the Eocene climate of 50 million years ago, when there were Alaskan palm trees and alligators splashed in the Arctic Circle. “The modern world will be much more of a killing field,” he said. “Habitat fragmentation today will make it much more difficult to migrate. But if we limit it below 10C of warming, at least you don’t have widespread heat death.” In 2010, Huber and his co-author, Steven Sherwood, published one of the most ominous science papers in recent memory, An Adaptability Limit to Climate Change Due to Heat Stress. “Lizards will be fine, birds will be fine,” Huber said, noting that life has thrived in hotter climates than even the most catastrophic projections for anthropogenic global warming. This is one reason to suspect that the collapse of civilisation might come long before we reach a proper biological mass extinction. Life has endured conditions that would be unthinkable for a highly networked global society partitioned by political borders. Of course we’re understandably concerned about the fate of civilisation and Huber says that, mass extinction or not, it’s our tenuous reliance on an ageing and inadequate infrastructure, perhaps, most ominously, on power grids, coupled with the limits of human physiology that may well bring down our world. In 1977, when power went out for only one summer day in New York, swaths of the city devolved into something like Hobbes’s man in a state of nature. Riots swept across the city, thousands of businesses were destroyed by looters and arsonists lit more than 1,000 fires. In 2012, when the monsoon failed in India (as it’s expected to do in a warmer world), 670 million people – that is, 10% of the global population – lost access to power when the grid was crippled by unusually high demand from farmers struggling to irrigate their fields, while the high temperatures sent many Indians seeking kilowatt-chugging air-conditioning. “The problem is that humans can’t even handle a hot week today without the power grid failing on a regular basis,” he said, noting that the ageing patchwork power grid in the United States is built with components that are allowed to languish for more than a century before being replaced. “What makes people think it’s going to be any better when the average summer temperature will be what, today, is the hottest week of the year in a five-year period and the hottest temperatures will be in the range that no one has ever experienced before in the United States? That’s 2050.” By 2050, according to a 2014 MIT study, there will also be five billion people living in water-stressed areas. “Thirty to 50 years from now, more or less, the water wars are going to start,” Huber said. In their book Dire Predictions, Penn State’s Lee Kump and Michael Mann describe just one local example of how drought, sea level rise and overpopulation may combine to pop the rivets of civilisation: “Increasingly severe drought in West Africa will generate a mass migration from the highly populous interior of Nigeria to its coastal mega-city, Lagos. Already threatened by rising sea levels, Lagos will be unable to accommodate this massive influx of people. Squabbling over the dwindling oil reserves in the Niger river delta, combined with potential for state corruption, will add to the factors contributing to massive social unrest.” “Massive social unrest” here being a rather bloodless phrase masking the utter chaos coming to a country already riven by corruption and religious violence. “It’s sort of the nightmare scenario,” said Huber. “None of the economists is modelling what happens to a country’s GDP if 10% of the population is refugees sitting in refugee camps. But look at the real world. What happens if one person who was doing labour in China has to move to Kazakhstan, where they aren’t working? In an economic model, they’d be immediately put to work. But in the real world, they’d just sit there and get pissed. If people don’t have economic hope and they’re displaced, they tend to get mad and blow things up. It’s the kind of world in which the major institutions, including nations as a whole, have their existence threatened by mass migration. That’s where I see things heading by mid-century.” And it doesn’t get any better after 2050. But forecasts about the disintegration of society are social and political speculations and have nothing to do with mass extinctions. Huber is more interested in the hard limits of biology. He wants to know when humans themselves will actually start to disintegrate. His 2010 paper on the subject was inspired by a chance meeting with a colleague. “I presented a paper at a conference about how hot tropical temperatures were in the geological past and [University of New South Wales climate scientist] Steve Sherwood was in the audience. He heard my talk and he started asking himself the very basic question: ‘How hot and humid can it get before things start dying?’ It was literally just an order of magnitude kind of question. I guess he thought about it and realised that he didn’t know the answer and wasn’t sure anyone else did either… Our paper really wasn’t motivated by the future climate per se, because when we started we didn’t know if there was any kind of realistic future climate state that would fall within this habitability limit. When we started, it was just like, ‘We don’t know. Maybe you have to go to, like, 50C global mean temperature.’ Then we ran a whole set of model results and it was rather alarming to us.” Sherwood and Huber calculated their temperature thresholds using the so-called wet-bulb temperature, which basically measures how much you can cool off at a given temperature. If humidity is high, for instance, things like sweat and wind are less effective at cooling you down and the wet-bulb temperature accounts for this. “If you take a meteorology class, the wet-bulb temperature is calculated by basically taking a glass thermometer, putting it in a tight wet sock and swinging it around your head,” he said. “So when you assume that this temperature limit applies to a human, you’re really kind of imagining a gale force wind, blowing on a naked human being, who’s doused in water, and there’s no sunlight, and they’re immobile and actually not doing anything other than basal metabolism.” Today, the most common maximums for wet-bulb temperatures around the world are 26C to 27C. Wet-bulb temperatures of 35C or higher are lethal to humanity. Above this limit, it is impossible for humans to dissipate the heat they generate indefinitely and they die of overheating in a matter of hours, no matter how hard they try to cool off. “So we were trying to get across the point that physiology and adaptation and these other things will have nothing to do with this limit. It’s the easy-bake oven limit,” he said. “You cook yourself, very slowly.” What that means is that this limit is likely far too generous for human survivability. “When you do real modelling, you hit a limit much sooner, because human beings aren’t wet socks,” he said. According to Huber and Sherwood’s modelling, 7C of warming would begin to render large parts of the globe lethally hot to mammals. Continue warming past that and truly huge swaths of the planet currently inhabited by humans would exceed 35C wet-bulb temperatures and would have to be abandoned. Otherwise, the people who live there would be literally cooked to death. “People are always like, ‘Oh, well, can’t we adapt?’ and you can, up to a point,” he said. “It’s just after that point that I’m talking about.” Already in today’s world, heated less than 1C above preindustrial times, heatwaves have assumed a new deadly demeanour. In 2003, two hot weeks killed 30,000 people in Europe. It was called a once-in-500-year event. It happened again three years later (497 years ahead of schedule). In 2010, a heatwave killed 15,000 people in Russia. In 2015, nearly 700 people died in Karachi alone from a heatwave that struck Pakistan while many were fasting for Ramadan. But these tragic episodes are barely a shade of what’s projected. “In the near term – 2050 or 2070 – the US Midwest is going to be one of the hardest hit,” said Huber. “There’s a plume of warm, moist air that heads up through the central interior of the US during just the right season and, man, is it hot and sticky. You just add a couple of degrees and it gets really hot and sticky. These are thresholds, right? These aren’t just like smooth functions. It gets above a certain number and you hurt yourself very badly.” China, Brazil, and Africa face similarly infernal forecasts, while the already sweltering Middle East has what Huber calls “existential problems”. The first flickers of this slow-motion catastrophe might be familiar to Europeans struggling to accommodate the tens of thousands of refugees at their borders: the collapse and mass migration of Syrian society came after a punishing four-year drought. Still others have noted that the Hajj, which brings two million religious pilgrims to Mecca each year, will be a physically impossible religious obligation to fulfil due to the limits of heat stress in the region in just a few decades. But for the very worst-case emissions scenarios, heatwaves would not merely be a public health crisis or a “threat multiplier”, as the Pentagon calls global warming. Humanity would have to abandon most of the Earth it now inhabits. In their paper, Huber and Sherwood write: “If warmings of 10C were really to occur in the next three centuries, the area of land likely rendered uninhabitable by heat stress would dwarf that affected by rising sea level.” Huber said: “If you ask any schoolchild, ‘What were mammals doing in the age of the dinosaurs?’ they’d say they were living underground and coming out at night. Why? Well, heat stress is a very simple explanation. Interestingly, birds have a higher set-point temperature – ours is 37C, birds’ is more like 41C. So I actually think that’s a very deep evolutionary relic right there. Because that wet-bulb temperature was probably maxing out around 41C in the Cretaceous, not 37C.” Back at the diner in New Hampshire, Huber told me about his “favourite story”: the US Army’s real-life parable of the so-called Motivated Point Man. In 1996, a platoon of light infantry spent days in the Puerto Rican jungle acclimatising to stifling heat and humidity, cautiously monitoring their water intake before simulating a night-time raid. The platoon included “some of the most fit and motivated soldiers in the battalion”. When the evening of the raid came, the platoon leader began leading his troops through the jungle, machete-ing a path through the brush. Before long, he was felled by fatigue and delegated his leadership to an underling. When the second private failed to advance the platoon quickly enough, the platoon leader demanded to lead again. But soon he found himself hyperthermic and unable to walk. His soldiers had to douse him in cold water and supply him with intravenous infusions. Eventually, four soldiers had to carry him. Before long, the extra demands vitiated the entire platoon, all of whom began to fall prey to heat stress. The exercise had to be called off before it became a massacre. “So I look at that as, if it’s night-time and acclimatised, fit people can just disintegrate into a pool of useless people on stretchers. That’s what I see happening to society, to cultures,” Huber said. “If you want to know how mass extinctions happen, that’s how. So when people talk about the Pleistocene megafauna extinctions and Clovis people, sometimes they act like it’s a mystery how these things happen. But it happens in exactly the same way. You have something tearing apart the strongest members, the weaker ones try to fill in the gaps, they’re really not strong enough to take it and the whole thing collapses. “You want to know how societies collapse?” Huber said. “That’s how.” Extracted from Ends of the World by Peter Brannen is published by Oneworld Publications (£18.99).

"Have you ever seen a headless toad? If the answer is no, now is a good time to go out looking for one. You see, it is almost exactly at this time of year that they are becoming headless thanks to the actions of tiny parasites that are emerging from out of their bodies. It is with these creatures that I would like to begin this piece about the worthiness or worthlessness of parasites.  The toadfly Lucilia bufonivora is a small, nondescript fly not unlike a bluebottle. In spring it anoints a chosen toad with some eggs, which it lays on the toad’s nose. The maggots that come forth from these eggs climb into the toad’s nostrils, where they begin to eat its nasal passages along with its eyes and brain before bursting forth from the toad’s head, all at once, later in the year. The result is a headless toad torso. Look out for them. How do the maggots know when to emerge en masse from the toad’s head? The answer is that, as the maggots grow, they become primed like a bomb. They become temperature-sensitive. They use the toad’s cold-bloodedness against it, activating a mass migration from the toad’s head when temperatures regularly drop below 14C … or about now. At the exact moment you read this, thousands of toads are walking around in the countryside with a ticking time bomb in their head. Primed like this, each toad becomes the bomb-laden bus that must not drive slower than 50mph in the film Speed – except the passengers are the bad guys. And the passengers are obsessed with the weather. And there are thousands of buses. As weird as it sounds, I’ve become a big fan of toadflies. The same goes for mites, protozoa, worms, fleas and ticks. Parasites are de rigueur for life on Earth. It was only a matter of time before a group of scientists would have the gall to call for their conservation. This happened on Wednesday, opening up an interesting area of ethical debate about whether such animals as worms and ticks are worth saving. The research paper used parasite specimens from the Smithsonian Institution’s Museum of National History to map out the survival fortunes of 457 parasites from across the world. By applying a range of climate models to these species it was discovered that, as an average, we may lose 10% of our global parasite diversity by 2070. If you include host creatures, many of which are facing extinction, the number of threatened parasite species skyrockets to one in three. The hangers-on are only just hanging on, it seems, and so our parasite friends may come to need us more than ever, to ensure their survival. Can we learn to love them, I wonder, particularly when they so often appear to cause such pain and suffering to other creatures? Sure, we could do without the parasites that cause intense distress to humans and their livestock and pets, but what about the rest? Would this be a poorer world without the humble toadfly? Or the emerald wasp, which makes zombies out of cockroaches? Or the flatworm larvae, which cause frogs to grow extra legs so that they can be eaten by birds, the only host in which the adult flatworm can mate? Or the slug mite? Would we even notice if creatures like these disappeared overnight? The answer, as scientists are increasingly coming to understand, is yes, very probably. In many habitats on Earth, parasitism probably exceeds predation (preying on other species) as a means of acquiring energy for new life. In estuarine habitats, for instance, the number of parasitic trematode worms is higher than the biomass of estuarine birds. They have become the biomass upon which other things feed. In a curious sort of way, these creatures are now the life-givers. There are other examples. On some oceanic islands, the lice and ticks and fleas that seabirds bring with them provide life-giving sustenance to scorpions, lizards and spiders, bolstering biological diversity. In a series of tests involving experimental grass plots in the US, the bulk of the biomass feeding on the grass didn’t come from the herbivores above ground, but rather from the parasitic fungus below. The more we study parasites, they more we understand their value to ecosystems. They are not passengers within buses, in other words, but buses within bigger buses. And so I am happy to welcome parasites to the conservation debate. Though we may feel uncomfortable with having to include them, in time I suspect we will come to realise that they have a part to play, one that has gone overlooked and unrecognised. With more research, perhaps we will come to see the best of ourselves in them. Energy harvesters. Ecological dynamos. Bringers of life. Or perhaps they have new things to teach us, like how better we might use the planet’s resources without anyone ever really noticing we were there. The true parasite-way. • Jules Howard is a zoologist and the author of Sex on Earth and Death on Earth"
"Climate change could wipe out a third of all parasite species on Earth, according to the most comprehensive analysis to date. Tapeworms, roundworms, ticks, lice and fleas are feared for the diseases they cause or carry, but scientists warn that they also play a vital role in ecosystems. Major extinctions among parasites could lead to unpredictable invasions of surviving parasites into new areas, affecting wildlife and humans and making a “significant contribution” to the sixth mass extinction already under way on Earth.  The new research, published in Science Advances, used the collection of 20m parasites held at the Smithsonian Institution’s Museum of National History in the US to map the global distribution of 457 parasites. The scientists then applied a range of climate models and future scenarios and found that the average level of extinctions as habitats become unsuitable for parasites was 10% by 2070, but extinctions rose to a third if the loss of host species was also included. “It is a staggering number,” said Colin Carlson at the University of California, Berkeley, who led the new work. “Parasites seem like one of the most threatened groups on Earth.” The severity of the impact varied with the different climate scenarios. For example, a 20% loss of parasite native ranges in scenarios where carbon emissions are rapidly cut in the future rises to 37% if emissions continue unchecked.  “Parasites are obviously a hard sell,” said Carlson. “Even if you are grossed out by them – and there are obviously downsides for individual hosts and for humans – parasites play a huge role in ecosystems.” They provide up to 80% of the food web links in ecosystems, he said. Having a wide range of parasites in an ecosystem also means they compete with one another, which can help slow down the spread of diseases.  “If parasites go extinct, we are looking at a potential massive destabilisation of ecosystems [which] could have huge unexpected consequences,” Carlson said, with other parasites moving in to take advantage. “That doesn’t necessarily work out well for anyone, wildlife or humans.”  One example of the complex role parasites can play is a hairworm that lives in grasshoppers in Japan and tends to lead its host to jump into water, where the grasshoppers become a major food source for rare fish. “In some subtle ways, parasites are puppeteers,” Carlson said. The research analysed more than 50,000 records of the 457 parasite species, which the researchers believe provides a representative picture. But, with more than 300,000 species of parasitic worms alone known to exist, working out the specific impact of parasite extinctions on diseases is complex and remains to be done. “It is difficult to summarise the net consequence, as we know so little about most parasites,” Carlson said. “Climate change will make some parasites extinct and make some do better. But we would argue the overall phenomenon is dangerous, because extinctions and invasions go hand in hand.” Anna Phillips, the curator of the Smithsonian’s parasite collection, said: “As long as there are free-living organisms, there will be parasites. But the picture of parasite biodiversity in 2070 or beyond has the potential to look very different than it does today based on these results.”"
"Marine life on the Antarctic seabed is likely to be far more affected by global warming than previously thought, say scientists who have conducted the most sophisticated study to date of heating impacts in the species-rich environment. Growth rates of some fauna doubled – including colonising moss animals and undersea worms – following a 1C increase in temperature, making them more dominant, pushing out other species and reducing overall levels of biodiversity, according to the study published on Thursday in Current Biology.  The researchers who conducted the nine-month experiment in the Bellingshuan Sea say this could have alarming implications for marine life across the globe as temperatures rise over the coming decades as a result of manmade greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Gail Ashton of the British Antarctic Survey and Smithsonian Environmental Research Center said she was not expecting such a significant difference. “The loss of biodiversity is very concerning. This is an indication of what may happen elsewhere with greater warning.” Sub-zero conditions near the south pole mean there are comparatively few species on the usually frozen land, but below the ice, the relative lack of pollution, traffic and fishing has left an abundance of marine life that divers and biologists compare to coral reefs. Previous studies of warming impacts have focused on single species, but the latest research examines an assemblage of creatures. Twelve identical 15cm sq heat plates were set in concrete on the seabed. Four were warmed by 1C, four by 2C and four left at ambient temperature as a control.  At 1C, a species of bryozoan moss (Fenestrulina rugula) became utterly dominant on the four plates. Within two months it reduced the evenness and diversity of the species spread. The researchers also found the marine worm Romanchella perrieri grew an average 70% larger than those under ambient conditions. At 2C, the results from different plates varied with different growth rates of different species. The researchers speculate that this may be because the higher increase in temperature had a greater shock impact. Ashton said further longer-term studies should be conducted but the overall trend was already clear. “The indication of change being more than anticipated is fairly reliable. This is the best data we have to date.” Until recently, most of the coverage of temperature rises has focused on the north pole, where the shrinking of arctic ice has been most visibly dramatic. But concerns are growing about the impact of global warming on the far bigger southern ice cap. Earlier this year, the United Nations weather agency announced that temperatures in the Antarctic recently hit a record high.  An Argentine research base near the northern tip of the continent recorded a balmy 17.5C in March 2015, the World Meteorological Organisation revealed.  The vast continent contains 90% of the world’s fresh water, most of it locked in ice that is several kilometres thick. The effects of climate change are not uniform, but concerns grew in July when a trillion tonne block of the Larsen C ice shelf collapsedinto the sea. The region is also steadily turning greener due to the increased growth of surface moss. UK-based scientists published a paper in May showing that growth rates of moss have accelerated more than fourfold since 1950. The latest study suggests the trend could become more evident on the sea bed as well as the land surface."
"The corporate backlash is growing against Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris climate accord, with Mars launching a $1bn sustainability plan and an M&M’s campaign centred on renewable energy.  It is the latest climate move by the family owned firm, which emerged as a vocal critic of the US president’s decision to pull out of the 2015 climate pact, saying it was “disappointed” with the withdrawal and stressing that corporations could not go it alone when it came to tackling climate change.   Mars is now rolling out a $1bn (£771m) investment to help cut greenhouse gas emissions across its value chain by 67% by 2050, run a poverty reduction and sustainability programme for farmers and suppliers, and ramp up food safety and security efforts.  Chief executive Grant F Reid said: “This plan is about not just doing better, but doing what’s necessary. We’re doing this because it’s the right thing to do but also because it’s good business.  “We expect to have a competitive advantage from a more resource-efficient supply chain, and from ensuring that everyone in our supply chain is doing well.”  The Snickers, Twix, Milky Way and Skittles maker has also revealed plans to champion renewable energy through its M&M’s brand, featuring images of things such as wind turbines alongside its red and yellow candy characters.  Its sustainability investments and M&M’s campaign were announced ahead of the UN general assembly and climate week which will run from 18 to 24 September in New York.  Reid said: “If we are to help deliver on the targets agreed in Paris and the UN sustainable development goals, there has to be a huge step change.  “While many companies have been working on being more sustainable, the current level of progress is nowhere near enough.”  The Paris agreement aims to prevent the Earth from heating up by 2C since the start of the industrial age.  Since the world has already warmed about 1.1C since the Industrial Revolution, the accord aimed at making sure the threshold was not breached with each nation curbing heat-trapping emissions.  All but a very small number of scientists say warming is a result of human activity.  The chief executive added: “Mars has been in business for four generations and intends to be for the next four generations.  “The only way that will happen is if we do things differently to ensure that the planet is healthy and all people in our extended supply chains have the opportunity to thrive.” "
"  Although individual action to protect the environment – consuming less, recycling more, reducing one’s carbon footprint – might be a contribution if enough people did it, the battle to minimise human-induced climate change has to be a worldwide endeavour among cooperating states. The outcome of the 2015 UN Climate Change Conference was one of the most optimistic and encouraging steps hitherto achieved in that battle – that is, until Donald Trump said he intended to withdraw the US, the biggest climate polluter in history, from the agreement. The Paris agreement and President Trump’s decision illustrate the two ends of the spectrum of effort and concern. Our planet cannot be protected from a warming atmosphere – with melting ice caps, rising sea levels, droughts, floods, famines and migrations of desperate populations – without vigorous joint effort by the world’s states.  It is thought that climate catastrophes caused turmoil in the past – perhaps at the beginning of the fourth millennium BCE, and in the early 12th century BCE, when entire civilisations in the Mediterranean and Near East collapsed in rapid succession into centuries of dark ages. Only this time – today, in our present world, with a global population of over seven billion that is growing ever faster – any such catastrophe will be many orders of magnitude greater. That is the situation that makes concerted international effort imperative. At the other end of the spectrum, President Trump’s announcement illustrates the fragility of international cooperation. It takes just one large rogue elephant in the herd to negate the endeavour. Any one of the US, China, India and the EU could undermine the sacrifice and determination demanded by the Paris agreement. It is a desperately sad move by any one large polluting economy if it refuses to cooperate. Such a decision condemns – actually condemns, not merely threatens to condemn – hundreds of millions of people to suffering, and almost certainly the whole planet to new dark ages.  Democracy is, as has been well said, the least bad of a lot of bad systems. But it pays a high price for the noble ideal of locating political authority in the consent of the people. Tyrants can make and act on quick decisions. Democracies debate and disagree, and move slowly. Tyrannies are efficient to the point of mercilessness. Democracies are inefficient to the point of ineffectiveness at times. The very nature of the political process in democracies means that leaders are reluctant to burden the populace with restrictions and sacrifices, lest they are voted out of office. But saving the planet requires restrictions and sacrifices. Leaders are reluctant to burden business with extra costs on emissions and other good environmental practices, lest they damage the economy, and again in consequence lose office. Tyrants have no such anxieties: they worry only about the assassin or eventual rebellion.  Democracy, accordingly, is not a natural ally of the tough measures required to combat climate change. And yet populations of democracies will be the first to punish their political leaders when the disastrous effects of climate change start hitting home.  What is required for democracies to become fully engaged in the fight to save the planet is that their citizens should be informed and thoughtful, and willing participants in the required sacrifices. Given the realities, say cynics, is not this a vain hope? Efforts to inform are manifold, but they are undermined by deniers and sceptics, among them Mr Trump. Efforts to encourage thoughtfulness and sacrifice among the people meet with the age-old reluctance on the part of too many people to attempt either.  Short-termism, self-interest, lack of real understanding, a head-in-the-sand attitude and several kinds of laziness and self-indulgence make us humans our own worst enemies: and in a democracy we all feel entitled to be all these things as a right.  There is nothing new in this. Plato, two and a half millennia ago, criticised democracy precisely because of this. But this is now a major life-threatening dilemma for our time.  The international order is effectively an anarchy if any of its members – sovereign states – refuse to play ball with the rest, or refuse to adhere to agreements previously made. What is the sanction against, say, the US if indeed it does withdraw from the Paris agreement? The international order is itself a loose form of democracy, and suffers the same deficits.  This fact illustrates where the nub of the problem lies: a lack of a sense of binding obligation to act for the benefit of others. Short-termism and self-interest are endemic weaknesses both of democracies and those who live in them. And these are precisely the things that have already wrought so much damage to the world’s climate, and threaten the people of the world with ever-increasing danger.  Human survival is of course not the only, though it is the most obvious, point at issue in the climate emergency we are facing. Peace, stability, human rights, the welfare of children – these will all collapse before the survival issue becomes the only one left. Now, not one of us should or would, I hope, seek to overturn democracy. But every one of us should, I hope, bend our thoughts vigorously to the problem of how to make the saving of our planet consistent with democracy. For surely, democracy and survival do not have to be in conflict. There have to be ways in which democracies can be full, compassionate, sensible partners with each other – indeed with everyone, no matter what the political system – in rescuing the planet from the peril that our historical self-indulgence and exploitation have already placed it in.  To ensure that the aims of the Paris agreement are met, there therefore has to be another effort alongside the drive for far greater sustainability in industrial-commercial activity. This is an overwhelming, unceasing drive to educate and re-educate every single individual on the planet about climate change.  The real and imminent dangers to lives and societies have to be driven home. People have themselves to become the goads driving politicians and governments to act. If the world’s people can be mobilised, then the short-termism and self-interest of the political classes in democracies will be addressed. Measures will be taken that people can understand are genuinely in their own real interests, as well as the interests of their fellows in the human story around the world.  Many are cynical about the potential of education to achieve anything like what is required here. Time and again, dreamers and idealists have launched themselves into education to better the world. But in the face of how things are in both national and international politics, other than climate-induced civilisational collapse itself, education is the only thing that has a hope of changing minds. It is all we have. But with massive effort we can make a difference, and perhaps enough of one to save our lives. We have to teach ourselves into freedom from this danger: nothing less can or will do.  • AC Grayling is master of the New College of the Humanities, London, and its professor of philosophy.

"Most of the east coast and parts of South Australia are at high risk of bushfire after one of the warmest, driest winters on record, a national conference has warned. Populated areas of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia have been marked “red” in the 2017 Southern Australia Seasonal Bushfire Outlook.  Weather experts and commissioners from each state’s rural fire services gathered in Sydney on Tuesday, warning residents in all states to be prepared for what is set to be a bad bushfire season. The outlook said most of Australia had above-average temperatures and below-average rainfall over winter and this had contributed to an elevated fire risk for the bulk of eastern and south Australian coasts. Australia has had its ninth driest winter on record, said Bureau of Meteorology climatologist David Jones, which has left greater fuel loads across southern Australia. The outlook said the warmer and drier than average weather over recent months, combined with the forecasts for spring, suggest that the southern fire season was likely to commence earlier than usual and be more active than normal. “[The] dry conditions now mean that vegetation is already dry with very low greenness evident in satellite data,” the report said. “The dry state of vegetation means that warm, windy conditions are likely to see more elevated fire risk than is normal for the time of year.” While the bureau expects more average rainfall levels in spring, it may not happen until well into the season.  The bureau has previously said Australia is set for a warm and dry spring with above-average temperatures expected for most parts of the country. After a string of balmy winter weeks, the chance of higher spring daytime temperatures is greater in the north and south-east of the country, it said.

"The word “adhockery”, I am told, was first used around 1890. But this term, which denotes an over-reliance on temporary solutions rather than on consistent, long-term plans deserves a renaissance when it comes to energy policies of the Turnbull government.  Has it really come to this? We are seriously being told that what we need to do is keep open a 50-year-old coal-fired power station for another five years from 2022. And this power station is generally regarded as the least efficient and most rundown we have. We’ve reached a new low point in adhockery.  It seems the government lurches from one short-term and temporary fix to another. They first tried to scrap the RET, which saw a thriving industry shrivel in the face of uncertainty and needed a bipartisan fix to get back on its feet, which Labor delivered. Then it was “Snowy 2.0”, which at this stage is really a feasibility study into a “wet battery”, which might be sensible but is years away in terms of delivery and even if delivered won’t provide any additional new generation. Now it is the jawboning and attempted public humiliation of a company to force it to keep open an asset which it correctly regards as past its use-by date. And of course this is not to mention gas. When Labor announced our “national interest test” policy on gas exports at the last election, because we could see this crisis coming, the government claimed there was no problem with gas exports and that our policy was dangerously interventionist. Now they beat their chest about how interventionist they are prepared to be, just 12 months later. Adhockery. Sensible people know there is a better way and that the lack of a coherent and stable policy framework is leading to a lack of investment and feeding into energy price rises which are eating away at our competitiveness. It’s been three months since the chief scientist Alan Finkel delivered his report to the government, which made it crystal clear that “uncertainty around emissions reduction policies was pushing up prices and undermining reliability”. Bipartisanship is critical if we want to get new investment in the energy sector. Why would a business look to invest in new electricity generation – typically investments which have 20- to 40-year investment horizons – if they see the government withering and dithering without any clear policy as to how it’s going to achieve its international emissions reduction commitments? It simply won’t. Hence Labor has said it is prepared to put aside its preferred policy solutions and embrace a clean energy target (CET) as recommended by the government’s own review, in an attempt to get that bipartisanship.  Political systems decide what and what not to contest on a partisan basis. In Australia, we don’t contest gun control for example. We long ago decided it was in the national interest not to have a partisan debate around this issue, in contrast to America. In Britain, the political parties decided not to contest energy and climate change, with all three major parties adopting very similar policies. Surely we can be mature enough to do the same in Australia. This adhockery has real economic costs, which concern me as the shadow treasurer and I wish concerned the treasurer more. As the chief executive of Alinta Energy said, the status quo in energy policy is like “playing a game of football with invisible goalposts: we don’t know what it is we are shooting for”. Or as the Business Council of Australia has said, “If we continue to do nothing then we will continue to pay higher prices and have a less secure electricity supply”. To put it another way, how can AGL for example be expected to make an important investment decision like on the Liddell power station, and what should replace it when it inevitably closes, when the government can’t provide a consistent policy framework in which to make that decision? Central questions like, will it be more economical to invest in new gas generation or intermittent renewables with battery storage, are impossible to even begin to answer unless you know the policy framework that will exist, not just next year but for many years to come. When asked about certainty in the energy sector, the Reserve Bank governor said recently that “I couldn’t disagree with the proposition that providing some certainty about the future structure of the electricity generation industry would be useful for the country, for investment, on prices and on household budgets”. “Jobs and growth” has been the treasurer’s mantra for the last year. Yet he’s happy to sit back and watch as billions of investment goes missing in the energy sector, a situation that is driving jobs and growth down, not up. In fact, it has been estimated that policy certainty associated with energy and climate change could detract up to 1% from GDP. A belief in well-designed regulation of properly functioning markets as the best way to drive positive outcomes for ordinary people used to be something the Liberal party believed in. This is sadly no longer the case. The Coalition is instead pressuring business to make decisions which may or may not be in their financial interests and flirting in financing new coal generation. All the while using taxpayers’ money for handpicked subsidies through its Direct Action policy. But according to the government, it’s the Labor party that “will turn us into Cuba”. Go figure. The Australian people and businesses expect that the treasurer is spending every waking moment in delivering the best policy settings for the nation instead of engaging in cheap stunts with lumps of coal and attacking energy company executives. If the Liberal party is incapable of putting in place these vital energy policy settings, then it will fall to the next Labor government. But the economic price to be paid for this short-termism in the meantime is going to be very substantial."
"New nuclear power stations may not be the best option for keeping Britain’s lights on and meeting the country’s carbon targets, the Liberal Democrats have said. The party said there were legitimate concerns over nuclear’s cost and the risks it would not be delivered on time, just days after windfarms secured state support far more cheaply than the Hinkley Point C atomic power station.  However, the party, which voted in support of nuclear four years ago after decades of opposition, said the technology should still be considered an option in the UK’s future energy mix.  “Nuclear power should be kept open as an option – but there is a risk that it may not be able to keep the lights on and that it may not be the lowest-cost option,” said the Lib Dems in a new report, authored by the former coalition minister Lynne Featherstone. Vince Cable, the party’s leader, said this week that the breakthrough low subsidy prices for offshore windfarms should prompt a “radical reappraisal” of how Britain is powered.  If the Lib Dems were to go so far as opposing atomic power again, it would mark a break in the pro-nuclear cross-party consensus of the three main parties.  Senior Lib Dems believe the party has an opportunity to seize the momentum on environmental issues, with Labour constrained on issues such as nuclear power because of its close association with trade unions.  Ed Davey, the Lib Dem MP and former energy minister who was pivotal in the party’s support for nuclear, said of the report: “It’s not about taking nuclear off the table. It’s responding to the evidence of the last two years. “It’s a recalibration off the back of the fact nuclear is not proving to be a practical, affordable technology. It’s not saying never [to nuclear], but the costs are coming down fast with renewables.” The report also backed an acceleration of renewable energy, carbon capture and storage (CCS) and greater flexibility of the energy system through storage and interconnectors with other countries. The party accused the Conservatives of “unravelling” progress on climate change made by the Lib Dems during the coalition government years.  “What worries me about the Tories is they have taken CCS off table, they’re not pushing forward with renewables,” said Davey. The report concludes that the UK is on course to miss its contribution towards the Paris climate agreement aspirational target of keeping global temperature rises below 1.5C.  To get back on track, the Lib Dems are calling for the Climate Change Act’s target of an 80% cut in carbon emissions by 2050 to be brought forward by five to 10 years.  Last year the government’s climate advisers warned that the UK lacked policies to meet half of the carbon reductions required by 2030. Ministers have produced a blueprint on how to close the gap, the Clean Growth Plan, which could be published as soon as next week. Before the party’s annual conference in Bournemouth this weekend, Cable said the world would “soon reach a tipping point beyond which catastrophic global warming will become irreversible” and Britain had a responsibility to set an example.  “Instead, these past two years the Conservatives have done their best to trash our green industries and undo the progress made during the coalition years,” he said.  “This report shows that becoming carbon-free by 2050 will be crucial if we are to meet the Paris agreement’s ambitious target of limiting temperature rises to 1.5 degrees. Furthermore, it sets out how this ambition can be delivered.” The party will also hope to burnish its environmental credentials in the coming months with the debate over Heathrow expansion, which it opposes. The majority of Labour MPs are in favour of expansion, as is the Unite trade union, although the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, are against further expansion."
"Climate contrarians, like Trump’s EPA administrator Scott Pruitt and Energy Secretary Rick Perry, don’t understand how scientific research works. They are basically asking for a government handout to scientists to do what scientists are should already be doing. They are also requesting handouts for scientists who have been less successful in research and publications – a move antithetical to the survival of the fitness approach that has formed the scientific community for decades.  The helping handout would be through a proposed exercise called a “red team/blue team” effort. It is a proposal that would reportedly find groups of scientists on both “sides” of the climate issue (whatever that means), and have them try to poke holes in each others’ positions. I will explain why this is a handout but first let’s talk about the plan and how it interferes with the scientific process. I say that Pruitt and Perry don’t understand how science works because we are already doing “red team/blue team” exercises everyday in our normal line of business. Science works by challenging each other and our ideas. If we think that a colleague has made an error, we tend to be merciless and tenacious to correct the errors. This is part of the premise of the concept of peer review – where we send studies and manuscripts to journals to have other experts objectively review them for errors. So back to the basic premise of a red team/blue team exercise – basically the “red team” would critique some conclusion of a “blue team.” The blue team would be able to respond, and there would be this back and forth exchange. On its face it sounds pretty straightforward even though scientists are already doing that in the scientific literature. But how would this work in practice?  First, how would the red team and blue team members be selected? Would they be picked by Pruitt and Perry who have already demonstrated a commitment to unbridled fossil fuel usage? The red team would almost certainly be selected from the very small but vocal group of contrarian scientists and non-scientists who have failed in the scientific arena. The fact is, there are no credible scientists who doubt that human emissions of greenhouse gases cause global warming. They just don’t exist.  There are some “lukewarmist” scientists who think the problem won’t be that bad, but these “lukewarmers” have failed to provide compelling evidence in the scientific literature. In many instances, their work has been shown to be wrong, the mainstream scientists have evaluated their claims and found them lacking or faulty. And this is why 97% of the world’s top climate scientists agree with each other on climate change.  So forming a red team would basically amount to a governmental helping hand to scientists who have not succeeded in the scientific arena. Since they cannot compete in the cut-throat area of scientific research, they would be given a free pass by the government to circumvent the normal peer review process. Let’s be clear, the red team cannot make the case in the scientific arena so they would be given a free pass to make their claims in the political arena. What would the exercise look like? Well that isn’t clear. Some ideas have been floated such as a live debate. Perhaps a red team response to a summary article such as the National Climate Report made public recently by the New York Times? Would it be special earmarked funding for contrarians to perform research? Would it be an “official” U.S. government report that is written by the contrarians? We just don’t know. But regardless of its manifestation, the result would be that contrarian scientists – who have already failed to make their case – would have their voices elevated to an inappropriate position of equality with those scientists whose work has survived scrutiny. The public would simply see two groups of “scientists” opposing each other, making it difficult for non-experts to discern who is correct. Finally, it would promote political ideology over scientific quality. Science works by being competitive; the best ideas and the best scientists are rewarded. The failed scientists and scientific ideas are discarded. By giving a free handout to failure, it would create an environment where you don’t have to be good at your job; you just have to have the right politics. Conservatives generally view handouts and bailouts as an anathema. When they realize that what underlies the red team effort is really just a bailout to failed ideas, they will not be supportive.  What I would suggest the so-called red team do is start competing in the trade of our profession. Complete studies and publish papers which support your hypothesis. Subject your ideas to criticisms, see if your ideas survive scrutiny.  If your ideas are failures, don’t go looking to Uncle Sam for a handout. Try again, think deeper, work harder. That is what real scientists do."
"It is possible to be killed by floods in Mumbai, but not really to be surprised by them. On 29 August, the city was battered by a monsoon storm which left homes, highways and hospital floors submerged, and shut down the commuter railway which has to carry more people every day than live in Denmark. More than 20 people are dead: swept away or crushed as multi-storey buildings collapsed. Bodies are still washing ashore. Instead of feeling surprise, though, Mumbai treated the deluge like an unwelcome guest who keeps coming by and trashing the place. The most unnerving collective flashback was to 26 July 2005. Ferocious rainfall that day turned the city into a lethal aquatic obstacle course, which 700 people did not survive. That year’s flood, like this one, was followed by a flood of assurances from elected leaders, and civic pledges to protect waterways and mangroves, and renewed attention to how a metropolis built largely on tidal estuary and marine “reclamations” could so easily return to the water.  As Mumbai wades through deja vu, provinces further east are struggling to keep their heads above water, as they have been for weeks. Hundreds of villages have been abandoned in Bihar, West Bengal and Assam. The direct death toll may exceed 800 (no one is likely to count the lives lost or stunted in the longer term – the result of crops, homes and public works swept away in some of India’s poorest states). Like Mumbai, though, these are places accustomed to flooding. Some of the world’s largest rivers flow through them, and spill their banks each monsoon. The mutability of land and water is an essential trait of parts of Bengal and Assam, and a theme in their literature. Amitav Ghosh, the bard of this theme in the English language, wrote of Bengal’s mangrove forests: “Here, in the tide country, transformation is the rule of life: rivers stray from week to week, and islands are made and unmade in days.” So are the plains, on occasion. Floods in eastern India are often woven into tradition, as part of the cycle that rejuvenates fields, fish stocks and wetland forest. This inclines Indians to acceptance. “Don’t try to fight nature,” the actor Amitabh Bachchan tweeted on the night of 29 August, as the storm abated in Mumbai. “Don’t put blame.” Well, we do put blame, and object to state incompetence, reckless urbanisation and failures of disaster response. Afterwards, though, especially when watching from indoors, we cherish the monsoon’s show of strength and surplus, and feel the familiarity of the flood. This is a deadly mistake. In Mumbai and Assam, recent floods have occurred where flooding is traditional, but no longer for traditional reasons. The storm in Mumbai deposited 15% of the city’s annual rainfall in a single day. The same occurred on 21 August in Chandigarh, northern India. Bengaluru, in the south, received 30% of its annual average on 15 August – the heaviest rainfall recorded in the past century. Mumbai’s storm is classed as an “extreme rain event”. Climate change models predict that they will become more frequent and proliferate into parts of India never thought of as monsoon hotspots, where the pumps are even less likely to be primed. This is the new, turbulent nature of our monsoon: that we are receiving more and more of our rainfall in extreme doses (which causes floods), and less in between the major deluges, which is when fields are fed and water tables recharged. For India, more flooding and more drought are not two possible futures. Both are here together, already. The submergence of so much of India by this monsoon is not an expression of timeless natural rhythms or even classic state failures. Extreme rain events mean that, as environmental scientist Sunita Narain put it, “floods in the time of drought are India’s new normal”. Recognising this is integral to creating homes, farms and infrastructure which can survive the changing monsoon. The government of Narendra Modi was elected, in part, on a promise of economic development, which it has struggled to deliver. One way to defend our gains, in real terms, is by moving fast to help cities and districts adapt: both to control flooding and save lives, and to harvest heavy rainfall and save water. • Raghu Karnad is journalist and editor-at-large at The Wire"
"The impacts of hurricanes Harvey and Irma were blunted because we saw them coming. Weather models accurately predicted the hurricane paths and anticipated their extreme intensities days in advance. This allowed millions of Floridians to evacuate the state, sparing countless lives. Some contrarians have tried to downplay the rising costs of landfalling hurricanes by claiming they’re only more expensive because there are now more people living along the coasts with more expensive stuff vulnerable to hurricane damages. However, those arguments fail to account for our ability to predict hurricane tracks earlier and more accurately by using better and better scientific models. We’re able to prepare for hurricanes much better today than in the past because we have more warning.  Although they focus on much different timescales and resolutions, climate and weather models are based on the same core physics. Scientists have a solid understanding of the Earth’s oceans and atmosphere, and that understanding is improving all the time.  Millions of people watched the evolution of the model forecasts for hurricanes Harvey and Irma, and made important decisions based on those forecasts. People trusted the models, and their trust proved to be well placed, as the model predictions were accurate.  And climate models have an even better track record. As I documented in my book Climatology versus Pseudoscience, since their inception in the 1970s, climate models have been remarkably accurate at predicting global warming. In a 1975 paper in Science, renowned climate scientist Wallace Broecker was one of the first to use early simple climate models to predict future global warming. Based on scientists’ understanding of the climate at the time, Broecker was only able to include the effects of human carbon emissions and ‘natural cycles’ (whose effects he overestimated) in his model, but the prediction was nevertheless remarkably accurate: Renowned Nasa climate scientist James Hansen made even better global warming predictions in 1981 and 1988, and the IPCC improved further yet in 1990, 1995, 2001, and 2007. On the other hand, the few climate contrarians that have had the courage to make their own predictions (without using climate models) have fared remarkably poorly.  Meanwhile recent research has shown that climate models have been even more accurate than we thought, when we compare apples-to-apples. And of course what those climate models tell us is extremely alarming. If we stay on our current path, we’re headed for 3–4°C global warming by 2100, which research indicates would lead to severe consequences like 40–70% of global species being at risk of extinction, millions more people being hit by coastal flooding, increased mortality from intensified heat waves, droughts, and floods, and so on. This raises an obvious question – if people trust weather models, and climate models with their even stronger track record predict we’re on such a dangerous path, why aren’t people loudly demanding climate action? In 1998, leading up to the critically important Kyoto Protocol international climate negotiations, Patrick Michaels from the fossil fuel-funded Cato Institute ‘think tank’ testified before Congress. Not surprisingly, considering his heavy reliance on fossil fuel funding, Michaels made the case that the US should not sign on to the Kyoto agreement (and succeeded - although the Clinton administration signed the treaty along with 150 countries, the US Senate refused to ratify it). In his testimony, Michaels essentially committed perjury in a reprehensibly dishonest effort to discredit Hansen’s 1988 global warming predictions. Hansen’s study had projected temperature changes under three different possible scenarios, which he called A, B, and C. In his testimony, Michaels deleted all but Scenario A with the highest greenhouse gas emissions, which was also the scenario that was least representative of real-world conditions. Worst of all, Michaels didn’t mention that he had deleted Hansen’s other scenarios, simply claiming (falsely): [Hansen’s] model predicted that global temperature between 1988 and 1997 would rise by 0.45°C (Figure 1). Figure 2 compares this to the observed temperature changes from three independent sources. Ground-based temperatures from the IPCC show a rise of 0.11°C, or more than four times less than Hansen predicted. You can see Michaels’ figure here – it even labeled Scenario A, but at no point did Michaels mention Hansen’s other scenarios. His claim that Hansen’s model predicted 0.45°C warming between 1988 and 1997 was flatly false – that was the model estimate under a scenario of much higher greenhouse gas emissions. Hansen subsequently asked, “Is this treading close to scientific fraud?” (yes, and to perjury). That was the start of a now nearly 20-year effort by climate deniers to discredit climate models. According to Skeptical Science, the claim that climate models are unreliable is the 6th most popular climate denial myth. It’s one that contrarian scientists repeat at every opportunity in congressional testimony to this day.  The reason is quite simple – if climate models are right, then if we don’t start cutting our consumption of fossil fuels, we’re in big trouble. But the GOP has now effectively become the Grand Oil Party – a subsidiary of the fossil fuel industry that does its bidding. They don’t want to curb our reliance on fossil fuels, so they attack the models, or like Rush Limbaugh, claim it’s all a hoax and then flee to California, leaving the duped followers behind to face the ugly consequences of science denial. There are some exceptions. The bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus, which now includes 28 House Republicans, acknowledged the impacts climate change is having on disasters like Harvey and Irma. We need more conservatives to accept reality and join their ranks. Scientific models saved countless lives from Harvey and Irma because we listened and acted. They can also save countless lives from climate change if we listen and take action to slow global warming. Or we can listen to the conspiracy theorists, ignore the scientists and their models, and suffer the consequences while the Rush Limbaughs of the world flee in their private jets to higher ground."
"A dramatic period of global warming 56 million years ago that saw temperatures climb by up to five degrees and triggered extinctions of marine organisms was down to volcanic eruptions, researchers have revealed, in a study they say offers insights into the scale and possible impact of global warming today. One of the most rapid periods of warming in Earth’s history, the Palaeocene/Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), occurred as Greenland pulled away from Europe.   However, details of the quantities of carbon dioxide behind the warming and where it came from had remained unclear.  Now scientists say they have solved the puzzle, revealing that the main driver of the event was a gradual release of carbon dioxide through volcanic eruptions – findings, they say, that overturn a long-held view that the PETM mirrors the rapid rise in carbon emissions seen today. “[The PETM] was always regarded as the best natural analogue for current anthropogenic carbon emissions – but we have found that not even that event is a actually good analogue,” said Marcus Gutjahr, first author of the study from the Geomar-Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research in Germany. “We are actually currently marching in unknown territory.” Writing in the journal Nature, Gutjahr and colleagues from the UK and US reveal how they unpicked the conundrum by combining computer simulations with an analysis of fossil shells from microscopic single-cell organisms found within a sediment core from the north-east Atlantic Ocean.  The team focused on the ratios of different forms – or isotopes – of oxygen, carbon and boron within the shells, the latter of which offers tell-tale clues about the ocean’s acidity, a measure affected by levels of carbon dioxide that dissolved from the atmosphere into the ocean. “These shells recorded the chemistry of the ocean in which [they] grew,” said Gutjahr. The carbon dioxide, he notes, could either have been pumped directly into the atmosphere through volcanic events or have formed from other carbon sources, such as underwater methane deposits or organic-rich sediments.  However, carbon dioxide from the different sources would have a very different impact on carbon isotope ratios. What’s more, while volcanic eruptions gradually release carbon dioxide over time, gases from methane deposits or sediments are released rapidly. Drawing these factors together with the level and duration of the increased ocean acidity, the team found that the carbon dioxide was probably released through volcanic eruptions, with such events accounting for up to 90% of the emissions. But, says Gutjahr, the study does not rule out the possibility of some very short, sudden releases of methane and other carbon sources. “The key things is the acidification took 20,000 years and if we had introduced enough methane over 20,000 years to keep the pH so low, then the carbon signature would be [very different to what we see],” he said.  The team were also able to calculate that overall between 10,200-12,200 petagrams of carbon were released into the atmosphere during the PETM – more carbon than is in the world’s total fossil fuel reserves – with rates of up to 0.58 petagrams of carbon released each year over 50,000 years. About 10 petagrams of carbon are currently released every year from fossil fuel emissions.  Daniela Schmidt, a professor of palaeobiology at the University of Bristol who was not involved in the study, said the study held a warning for the planet today.  “We know something which was smaller than what we are currently doing had profound biological implications,” she said. “We always assume that if something happens quicker and we have less time to adapt, the impact will be larger.” Mark Maslin, professor of geography at University College London, said the case for volcanic eruptions being behind the PETM was compelling, adding that the research suggests underwater sources of carbon, like methane deposits, might be more stable than previously thought and play a smaller role in climate change. But, he added, there are plenty of causes for concern, not least the rapid rate of carbon emissions today, and Earth’s current sensitivity to such changes, means the planet will not be able to adjust in the same way it did in the past. What’s more, he said, the potential loss of other carbon-rich deposits remains a serious issue. “We should still be worried about methane stored in the permafrost in the high Arctic,” he said."
"As a strong supporter of same-sex marriage I am not happy about the postal survey. But as a career researcher, I am even more dismayed. It’s not a plebiscite, obviously. It’s not a vote as we understand it in the Australian context (not compulsory, not conducted by the Australian Electoral Commission and no satisfying sausage afterwards). And no self-respecting researcher would call it a survey. I’ve started referring to it as “a thingy”. But let me be clear – it is a vitally important “thingy”. In fact it is probably more important to take part in this “thingy” because the usual rules around voting and surveys don’t apply. The results will not be weighted to reflect Australian Bureau of Statistics data, as any decent survey would be. And the usual carrot and stick involved in voting is absent. If enough Australians deliver their postal survey in time, we can transform this into something real and meaningful. If almost all of the community gets involved – not just the dedicated supporters for and against – then this “thingy” becomes something else. More than deciding the issue of marriage equality, it will also be an interesting test of our civic engagement. How prepared are we to have our say if a fine or a cake stall is not involved?   And so I was pretty excited to see in the Guardian Essential Poll that 62% of those polled definitely intend to vote and a further 12% will probably vote and 9% have already voted. That’s 83% likely to vote or already voted (the last federal election saw 95% of eligible voters turn up at the ballot box).  Of those likely to vote, the predictable trends are still evident. The older you are the more likely you are to report you will vote. The more likely you are to support marriage equality the more likely you are to report you will vote. Older people are less likely to support marriage equality and more likely to post letters. And yet the AEC saw a surge in young people putting their names on the electoral roll once it was clear the postal survey was going ahead.  It’s a guessing game at this stage whether one demographic tendency will cancel out the other. I’ve been asked my view about what will happen, but to be honest I have no idea because so many elements are unprecedented and unpredictable. If enough postal surveys flow in roughly reflecting the makeup of the population, then the result will be predictable. The yes option will prevail. That would be, in research terms at least, unprecedented. While our political leaders have constructed the most convoluted process to decide such a straightforward issue, there is the continuing challenge of climate change and energy transition crackling in the background, where simplistic ideas are constantly put forward to solve complex problems. (More coal stations! Create a green army of unemployed youth to plant more trees!) You don’t have to be an expert prognosticator to know that energy prices and energy transition are on the political agenda permanently throughout the government and the nation. As the Essential Report shows, concerns about the costs of electricity and gas trump housing, medical and food costs (across age groups, too, and even among those who are financially comfortable). Concern about addressing climate change is up 7% since December last year, with 56% saying we are not doing enough.  As so many other polls have shown consistently, the majority of Australians believe climate change is happening and is caused by human activity. Could a concern about the rising costs of utilities be somehow connected to a concern about lack of action on climate change? The qualitative research I’ve conducted over the last decade says yes. Without a long-term approach to energy that is more reliant on investment in renewables and less on old technologies of oil and gas, we will need more power to do the same things we do today and costs will increase.  You don’t need an expensive postal survey to know the public expects a more sophisticated, less partisan approach to energy policy. Forget about bakers forced to fire up the ovens to make cakes for same-sex weddings in the new year. Australians worry about keeping the lights on in the years to come. • Rebecca Huntley is the director of research at Essential Media"
"Joss Hanbury, master of the Quorn hunt, says foxhounds have “been bred for generations to hunt live prey”, giving this as a reason why hunts keep killing foxes, implying that it’s just one of those unfortunate things that can’t be helped (News). If someone’s bull terriers savaged a bull, it would be no good the owner pleading that the breed had been bred for bull-baiting and therefore there wasn’t much he could do to stop them. He would be prosecuted and the dogs might well be destroyed. But hunts take out packs of 30-plus dogs that they state are uncontrollable and take them to coverts almost certain to contain foxes. So foxes get chased and killed and the hunts pretend they thought the hounds were on a non-existent “trail”.  I have been a hunt monitor for 23 years and have watched hundreds of hunts. I am convinced that trail hunting does not exist, but is a front for every hunt to continue hunting live quarry, a “cynical subterfuge” in the words of one unusually percipient judge. However, considering its fatuousness, this excuse is remarkably successful at repeatedly getting hunts out of trouble. The National Trust should bear in mind that a landowner allowing illegal hunting to take place can be prosecuted. If it succeeds in crushing the motion to ban all trail hunting on NT land, it will have placed itself in an invidious position.Penny LittleGreat HaseleyOxfordshire The extreme weather that has caused devastation in Florida, Houston, the Caribbean and south-east Asia is symptomatic of climate breakdown, which is happening as a result of global warming caused mainly by the burning of fossil fuels (“Survivors of Irma beg for aid”, News). We have about 15 years to stabilise the atmosphere before climate breakdown becomes unstoppable. It will result in the failure of staple crops in tropical zones, floods, droughts, wars over land and resources such as clean water and chaotic, forced mass migration to temperate parts of the world. The maturing of the renewable energy industry and developments in smart grids and battery storage mean we have a chance to avert climate breakdown. The most effective action we can take is to switch to a 100% renewable energy supplier. Nuclear power is too expensive, too slow to build and too dangerous. Cumbria’s police and crime commissioner recently described Sellafield as a big strategic target for terrorists. This applies to all nuclear power plants. The only sensible future is based on clean, safe, affordable and abundant renewable energy.Anne DismorrNorwich I read with interest of the looming “winter of discontent” (News). Living in a seaside resort with problems of deprivation, it beggared belief that universal credit was trialled here. I think the disingenuous premise was that if it could work here, it would work anywhere. But this led to severe problems for many. The chancellor cannot rule and divide between public sector workers. The removal of this unfair pay cap needs to apply to all. If this is achieved, we may begin to believe in the government’s tarnished mantra of wanting a society that works for all.Judith A DanielsGreat Yarmouth As an addendum to Catherine Bennett’s article (“PR execs behaving badly…, Comment), it is worth noting that during the Bell Pottinger scandal, the Public Relations and Communications Association did little or nothing to rein in the agency’s shocking activities in South Africa, until its shamefully silent hand was forced. It is legitimate to ask who else within the PRCA membership is enjoying the comfort of a blind eye while they pursue similar immoral activities.Mike AbbottLondon W4 Your review of Andy and Peter Holden’s Natural Selection exhibition (“Birds do it…”, New Review) talks of the “former Newington Library” but the library still exists, housed in a metal container above a collection of takeaways rather than in the distinguished building purpose-built for it 125 years ago. Four years ago, a fire started in the neighbouring Cuming Museum and it and the library have been closed since. Southwark council said it would cost £40m to make safe and yet a private art academy did so for £30,000. In consultation, residents asked for a library – instead, they got this. Admirable as I’m sure the exhibition is, it is under the shadow of the wider gentrification of the Elephant. Did the council deliberately come up with an unworkable figure? It has a good record on libraries. Clarity would be welcome.

"The health implications of coal-fired power should be a main concern in Australia’s debate over energy generation, doctors have argued.  Speaking on the ABC’s Q&A program, the chair of Doctors for the Environment New South Wales, Dr John Van Der Kallen, asked panellists why health was not a primary consideration in the discussion over the closure of coal-fired power stations such as the Liddell plant in the Hunter Valley “when we know that the pollution from these coal-fired power stations contributes to respiratory and cardiovascular illness, as well as premature death?”  Doctors for the Environment also oppose the proposed Adani coalmine in Queensland, which if built, will be the largest in Australia, and one of the largest in the world.  “It will significantly increase Australia’s contribution to international carbon emissions and threaten the health of millions of people in Australia and around the world.” Emma Herd, chief executive of the Investor Group on Climate Change, said health concerns over coal-fired power were driving movement to renewables in other parts of the world. “You only have to look at China which is grappling with some really substantial and quite dangerous health impacts on the community in terms of not having heavily regulated the coal-fired power industry and not managing the health implications of coal-fired generation.” Herd said governments and business needed to take into account the physical and environmental effects of different types of energy generation. “Interestingly enough, it is this very driver of managing environmental pollution which is actually now the basis of so much of China’s actions in terms of being a world leader in investing in renewable energy, taking it to more than 50% of global investment in renewable energy in the last few years.” Why is health not a consideration in closure of coal fired power stations? @MichaelSukkarMP & @emmalherd respond #QandA pic.twitter.com/594EK9ladY The assistant minister to the treasurer, Michael Sukkar, said Australia’s energy’s policy needed to be a balance between reliability, affordability and environmental concerns. “The government has a focus, we want to ensure reliability, we want to assure affordability, and, of course, we want to meet our emissions reduction targets – 26 to 28% under the Paris accord. We are focused on those three objectives.” Sukkar said each objective needed to be carefully weighed against the others. “Of course, the environmental objective … is one very important one. But we do have to manage this transition and … at the end of the day, when the wind is not blowing and the sun is not shining … everyone around the country still expects to be able to switch their lights on and know that it’s going to be there. “That’s what we need. Now, coal for the foreseeable future, will play a role in that. Of course, it’s playing a diminishing role over time, but in our lifetime, it will stay a big role.” When will the Federal Government formulate a comprehensive energy policy? @MichaelSukkarMP & @SenatorWong #QandA pic.twitter.com/2n5lDUUvDf"
"From my vantage point outside the glass doors, the sea of grey hair and balding pates had the appearance of a golf society event or an active retirement group. Instead, it was the inaugural meeting of Ireland’s first climate denial group, the self-styled Irish Climate Science Forum (ICSF) in Dublin in May. All media were barred from attending. Its guest speaker was the retired physicist and noted US climate contrarian, Richard Lindzen. His jeremiad against the “narrative of hysteria” on climate change was lapped up by an audience largely composed of male engineers and meteorologists – mostly retired. This demographic profile of attendees at climate denier meetings has been replicated in London, Washington and elsewhere.  How many people in the room had children or indeed grandchildren, I wondered. Could an audience of experienced, intelligent people really be this blithely indifferent to the devastating impacts that unmitigated climate change will wreak on the world their progeny must inhabit? These same ageing contrarians doubtless insure their homes, put on their seatbelts, check smoke alarms and fret about cholesterol levels.  Why then, when it comes to assessing the greatest threat the world has ever faced and when presented with the most overwhelming scientific consensus on any issue in the modern era, does this caution desert them? Are they prepared quite literally to bet their children’s lives on the faux optimism being peddled by contrarians?  “We have been repeatedly asked: ‘Don’t you want to leave a better Earth for your grandchildren,’” quipped the comedian and talk show host John Oliver. “And we’ve all collectively responded: ‘Ah, fuck ’em!’” This would be a lot funnier were it not so close to the bone. Short-termism and self-interest is part of the answer. A 2012 study in Nature Climate Change presented evidence of “how remarkably well-equipped ordinary individuals are to discern which stances towards scientific information secure their personal interests”. This is surely only half the explanation. A 2007 study by Kahan et al on risk perception identified “atypically high levels of technological and environmental risk acceptance among white males”. An earlier paper teased out a similar point: “Perhaps white males see less risk in the world because they create, manage, control and benefit from so much of it.” Others, who have not enjoyed such an armchair ride in life, report far higher levels of risk aversion.  Another 2011 paper observed uncontroversially that “conservative white males are likely to favour protection of the current industrial capitalist order which has historically served them well”. It added that “heightened emotional and psychic investment in defending in-group claims may translate into misperceived understanding about problems like climate change that threaten the continued order of the system.” A paper earlier this year from Vanderbilt University pinpointed what motivates many who choose to reject climate change: not science denial, but “regulation phobia”. Most deniers accept science in general, and even pride themselves on their science literacy, however, combatting climate change means more regulations and, the paper says, “demands a transformation of internalised attitudes”. This, the authors conclude, “has produced what can fairly be described as a phobic reaction among many people”. Facing up to climate change also means confronting the uncomfortable reality that the growth-based economic and political models on which we depend may be built on sand. In some, especially the “winners” in the current economic system, this realisation can trigger an angry backlash.  This at last began to make sense of these elderly engineers crowding into hotel rooms to engage in the pleasant and no doubt emotionally rewarding group delusion of imagining climate change to be some vast liberal hoax. In truth, the arguments hawked around by elderly white male climate deniers like Fred Singer, William Happer and Nigel Lawson among others are intellectually threadbare, pockmarked with contradictions and offer little more than a cherry-picked parody of how science actually operates. Yet this is catnip for those who choose to be deceived.  It is, however, deeply unfair to tar all elderly white men as reckless and egotistical; notable exceptions include the celebrated naturalist David Attenborough and the former Nasa chief Jim Hansen. But their voices are often lost in the fog of denial. A century after elderly military leaders cheerfully sent millions of young men from the trenches to their slaughter in the first world war, the defiant mood of today’s climate deniers is best captured by the stirring words of Blackadder’s General Melchett: “If nothing else works, a total pig-headed unwillingness to look facts in the face will see us through!”"

"On Monday, we published a paper in the scientific journal Nature Geoscience that re-evaluated how much carbon dioxide we can still afford, collectively, to emit into the atmosphere and still retain some hope of achieving the ambitious goals of the Paris climate agreement to “pursue efforts” to keep global temperatures to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The carbon budget we found, to yield a two-in-three chance of meeting this goal, was equivalent to starting CO2 emission reductions immediately and continuing in a straight line to zero in less than 40 years: a formidable challenge. Formidable, but not inconceivable. The distinction matters, because if it were already completely impossible to achieve the Paris ambition, many might argue there was no point in pursuing those efforts in the first place – or that the only option left is immediately starting to cool the planet with artificial volcanoes.   We knew this finding would be controversial, since previous estimates had indicated that to meet the same goal, emissions might have to reach zero in well under a decade, which really is inconceivable. Crucially, the reason for the correction was not that we had a new estimate of the climate response, or warming per tonne of CO2 emitted – we used exactly the current consensus range – but that we took better account of past emissions and where human-induced warming has got to already. It was a relatively technical paper, so we prepared as best we could, wrote a non-technical blogpost and organised a press briefing with the Science Media Centre. Almost all of the initial coverage on Monday and Tuesday was accurate: both the Times and Telegraph had headlines about ‘wrong’ or ‘faulty’ models, but in the articles beneath them, Ben Webster and Henry Bodkin were careful not to say there was any evidence the models were systematically over-responding to CO2. We took pains at the briefing to stress the discrepancy was likely due to other, more transient, factors. Those who were there evidently understood. Then the opinion writers piled in. Writing in Breitbart, James Delingpole announced that our paper “concedes that it is now almost impossible that the doomsday predictions made in the last IPCC assessment report of 1.5C warming above pre-industrial levels by 2022 will come true.” Which would be exciting, except that the 2013 IPCC report made no such prediction. In fact, the IPCC specifically assessed that temperatures in the 2020s would be 0.9-1.3C warmer than pre-industrial, the lower end of which is already looking conservative. Anyone who had troubled to read our paper would have found this “IPCC AR5 Ch11 projection” helpfully labelled on two of our figures, and clearly consistent with our new results. In the Daily Mail, Graham Stringer, a Labour MP, weighed in: “According to these models, temperatures across the world should now be at least 1.3C above the mid-19th century average.” Except, they don’t show that, and nor did our paper. Because CO2 concentrations are much better known than emissions, models calculate both the emissions needed to reach observed concentrations and the temperature response. In many models, total accumulated CO2 emissions do not reach today’s level until well after 2020, by which time the level of human-induced warming in the models can indeed be about 0.3C warmer than it is in the real world today, depending on how you measure it. Which means you need to be careful about using these models to work out the remaining carbon budget for an ambitious goal like 1.5C – precisely the point of our paper. In a rapidly warming world, a few years makes a big difference: the discrepancy between modelled temperatures today and observed temperatures today is much smaller. Moving on to the Sun, James Delingpole (again) announced that our paper would “scotch the […] myth […] that man-made carbon dioxide (CO2) is causing the planet to warm at such dangerous and unprecedented speeds that only massive government intervention can save us.” Note the careful wording. Delingpole presumably knew that our paper said nothing at all about revising the impact of CO2 on climate. But by adding a swipe at government intervention, perhaps he hoped to pack just enough into that sentence to squeak it past the UK Independent Press Standards Organisation (which presumably has no sway over Breitbart). So after reasonably accurate initial reporting, suddenly our paper was about a downgrading of the threat of climate change, when it was actually nothing of the kind: our predictions for warming rates over the coming decades are identical to those of the IPCC, and we do not assess the impacts of climate change for any warming level. And then, of course, these ideas were picked up by sympathetic editors all over the world. Who really loses from all this? While Delingpole and Stringer were making out that our paper was about something it wasn’t, it seems to have prompted much more interesting conversations among scientists around the world about what the true level of human-induced warming really is, and what the Paris goal actually means.  These are important questions. For such a tight target, the actual remaining carbon budget is sensitive to a number of assumptions, including even how we define global average temperature. Significant uncertainties remain, and while we believe our paper improves on previous estimates, it is by no means the last word. But debating the current level of human-induced warming and how it relates to the 1.5C goal feels a bit like discussing how best to steer a spacecraft into orbit around Saturn while Delingpole and Stringer are urging their readers to question whether the Earth goes round the Sun. Critics of mainstream climate policy frequently complain that they feel excluded. The real problem is that they exclude themselves, and their readers, from the discussion as soon as it starts to get interesting. "
"Three decades ago when serious debate on human-induced climate change began globally, a great deal of statesmanship was on display. A preparedness to recognise that this was an issue which transcended nation states, ideologies and political parties. An issue which had to be addressed proactively in the long-term interests of humanity, even if the existential nature of climate risk was far less clear cut than it is today. Then, as global institutions were put in place to take up this challenge and the extent of change this would impose on the fossil-fuel dominated world became more obvious, the forces of resistance mobilised. Today, despite the diplomatic triumph of the Paris climate agreement, debate around climate change policy has never been more dysfunctional, indeed Orwellian, particularly in Australia.  In his book Nineteen Eighty-Four, George Orwell describes a double-speak totalitarian state where most of the population accepts “the most flagrant violations of reality, because they never fully grasped the enormity of what was demanded of them, and were not sufficiently interested in public events to notice what was happening. By lack of understanding they remained sane.” Orwell could have been writing about climate change and policymaking.  International agreements talk of limiting global warming to 1.5–2°C, but in reality they set the world on a path of 3–5°C. Goals are reaffirmed, only to be abandoned. Coal, by definition, is “clean”. Just 1°C of warming is already dangerous, but this cannot be said. The planetary future is hostage to myopic, national self-interest. Action is delayed on the assumption that as yet unproven technologies will save the day, decades hence. The risks are existential, but it is “alarmist” to say so. A one-in-two chance of missing a goal is normalised as reasonable. Climate policymaking for years now has been cognitively dissonant, “a flagrant violation of reality”. So the lack of understanding among the public and elites of the full measure of the climate challenge is unsurprising. Yet most Australians sense where we are heading: three-quarters of people see climate change as a catastrophic risk and half see our way of life ending within the next 100 years.  The previous norms of statesmanship and long-term thinking have long since disappeared, replaced by an obsession with short-term political and commercial advantage, particularly where climate and energy policy is concerned. An emergency-scale transition to a post-fossil fuel world is essential to address climate change. But this is considered to be too disruptive. The orthodoxy is that there is time for an orderly economic transition within the current short-termist political paradigm. Discussion of what would be safe – less warming that we presently experience – is non-existent. And so we have a policy failure of epic proportions. In the magical thinking of Australian policymakers, a pathway of gradual change, constructed over many decades in a growing, prosperous, coal-fired world stretches enticingly before us. The world not imagined is the one that now exists: of looming financial instability; of a global crisis of political legitimacy; of a sustainability crisis that extends far beyond climate change to include all the fundamentals of human existence, and of severe global energy sector dislocation. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was established by the UN in 1988 and charged with regularly assessing the global consensus on climate science as a basis for policy-making. The IPCC assessment reports produced every five to six years play a critical part in the public framing of the climate narrative. The IPCC has done indispensable work in pulling together a periodic consensus of what must be the most exhaustive scientific investigation in history.  However, the process suffers from all the dangers of consensus-building in such a wide-ranging and complex arena. For example, its reports, of necessity, do not always contain the latest available information. Consensus-building can lead to “least drama” lowest-common-denominator outcomes which overlook critical issues, particularly the implications of the “fat-tails” of probability distributions, namely high impact but relatively low-probability events where scientific knowledge is limited. Vested interest pressure is acute; climate denialists accuse the IPCC of alarmism, whereas climate action proponents consider the IPCC to be far too conservative. To cap it all, the IPCC conclusions are subject to intense political oversight before being released, which has had the effect of substantially watering down sound scientific findings.  These limitations were not of overriding importance in earlier years. However, it is now clear that the risks are far greater than previously anticipated. Climate change has moved from the twilight period of much talk but limited impact; it is now turning nasty, as witnessed with Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, in South Asia, and not to forget Cyclone Debbie in Australia earlier this year. The distinction between climate science and risk is now the critical issue, for the two are not the same. Scientific reticence, the reluctance to spell out the full risk implications of climate science in the absence of perfect information, has become a major problem, allowing politicians to ignore the real dangers we face. But waiting for perfect information means it will be too late to act, as any sensible risk manager or military leader knows only too well. Like an iceberg, there is great danger in ignoring “What lies beneath”. The irresponsible invective passing for political debate on climate and energy policy is replete with assurances that politicians are devoted to ensuring the security of the Australian people. Nothing could be further from the truth. Those assurances are meaningless unless climate risk is honestly addressed and that must happen long before we are confronted with our own equivalent of Irma. At present that risk is totally ignored."

" The Australian government’s science agency, the CSIRO, has paid tens of thousands of dollars to peak mining lobby group the Minerals Council of Australia, which fights against government action on climate change. The CSIRO has been listed as an “associate member” of the Minerals Council of Australia (MCA) since at least 2004 and new documents obtained by the Australian Institute, under freedom of information laws, show that in 2017 the “annual subscription” for membership was just under $10,000.  The mining lobby plays a vocal role in Australian climate change policy debates and the positions it takes are on the extreme end of the spectrum and include pushing for more coal power stations to be built. The CSIRO continues to be a member of the MCA despite even Australia’s biggest climate polluter, AGL, publicly parting ways with the Minerals Council of Australia in 2016, saying it did so because of the positions the MCA took on climate change. “AGL’s positions on climate change and renewable energy differed from those held by the Minerals Council of Australia ... and AGL has elected not to renew its membership,” the company said in its 2016 sustainability report. CSIRO declined to answer specific questions about how long it had been a member, what the cost had been and what the CSIRO got in return for membership. A CSIRO spokesman instead gave a statement, published in full below. The executive director of the Australia Institute, Ben Oquist, said: “The Minerals Council has been on the fringe of the climate and energy debate in Australia, opposing policies that would tackle emissions effectively. “It defies commonsense that the CSIRO, an organisation that researches climate change and develops renewable technology, gives money to a lobby group that campaigns against effective climate policy and against policies that would increase renewable energy.” CSIRO has come under fire in recent years for a perception it has not been giving fearless advice to the public and to government on climate-related issues. At the same time, the organisation has cracked down on employees who themselves seek to speak publicly on policy issues. Internal CSIRO emails leaked earlier this year show significant internal unrest over CSIRO’s failure to make a submission to the government’s consultation on greenhouse gas emissions targets in 2009. In one email, a CSIRO executive said it didn’t provide a submission because the “questions posed in the discussion paper are very policy-focused”. She said CSIRO would engage government agencies behind closed doors. But Oquist said one of MCA’s main functions is to lobby to change government policy. “In its 2013 annual report the MCA boasts it ‘was at the forefront of the debates over the carbon and mining taxes; and their abolition (expected after July 2014) will be in no small part due to the council’s determined advocacy on both issues’,” Oquist said. “While the commonwealth’s key scientific research organisation effectively funds political advocacy for the coal industry, it works to prohibit its own staff from commenting on national science policy.” John Church, a world-leading climate scientist who was made redundant in the organisation’s 2016 job cuts and who was one of the disgruntled employees in the leaked emails, told the Guardian CSIRO’s membership of the MCA was in contradiction to its refusal to engage in policy debates. “I would definitely say there was a conflict,” Church said. “CSIRO is putting itself in a position where it is implicitly supporting particular policy positions by being a member of the Minerals Council. “They should not only be independent but be seen to be independent.” A senior climate scientist still at the CSIRO told the Guardian that currently it is almost impossible for climate scientists there to speak publicly about policy. David Karoly, a climate scientist from the University of Melbourne and a former member of the government’s Climate Change Authority, said: “It’s a small amount of money but it is odd in my view that they are spending this level of funding on an organisation that is arguing against the conclusions the CSIRO has made about the science of climate change.” When asked about AGL’s move to quit the MCA, Tim Nelson, AGL’s head of economics, policy and sustainability, told the Guardian: “We think there’s a strong opportunity for all corporates and industry associations to document a very scientific approach to how they see the consistency of their industry and their business with the 2C goal that Australia has signed up to.” The Minerals Council of Australia website says “full membership” is given to companies “directly involved in mining, prospecting or contracting activities relating to the obtaining, concentrating, smelting ore refining of minerals.” They say “associate membership”, such as that held by the CSIRO, “is open to companies which carry on as their principal business the supply of equipment, materials, services or capital to a company eligible for full membership.” Other public organisations with associate membership of MCA include ANSTO Minerals and the University of Western Australia. A CSIRO spokesman gave the following statement: CSIRO has a long history collaborating with professional societies and bodies including industry associations. Memberships are an important part of our dialogue with a wide range of stakeholders by allowing us to build networks, share research results, collaborate on research projects, and generally help ensure the relevance and uptake of our research. No organisation we are a member of has authority to speak or act on behalf of CSIRO. Further, as standard practice CSIRO officers must work within relevant policies to ensure our independence and impartially. For example, they cannot comment on policies of the government, opposition or any other political parties; or outside of their areas of expertise in their interactions with any industry body. An MCA spokesman said: “The MCA represents Australia’s mining industry as part of its contribution to sustainable development, economic growth and social and community affairs. “As outlined on our website, full membership of the MCA is available to businesses involved in mining, prospecting or contracting activities while associate membership is open to groups providing equipment, materials, services or capital to mining companies.” ANSTO Minerals, part of the government-owned Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation is also an associate member of the Minerals Council and a spokesman said ANSTO was a member of the Uranium Forum of the MCA and also sits on the radiation protection working group. “These are forums through which we provide advice on all aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle including safety, compliance, radiation management, efficiency, and international best practice,” the spokesman said."
"The Arctic ice cap melted to hundreds of thousands of square miles below average this summer, according to data released late on Tuesday. Climate change is pushing temperatures up most rapidly in the polar regions and left the extent of Arctic sea ice at 1.79m sq miles at the end of the summer melt season.   This is the time when it reaches its lowest area for the year, before starting to grow again as winter approaches. The 2017 minimum was 610,000 sqmiles below the 1981-2010 average and the eighth lowest year in the 38-year satellite record. Scientists from the US National Snow and Ice Data Centre (NSIDC) said the rate of ice loss this summer had been slowed by cool mid-summer weather over the central Arctic Ocean. The record minimum came in 2012, when the ice area fell to 483,000 square miles below the 2017 extent. Ted Scambos at NSIDC said the Arctic sea ice had set a record for the smallest winter extent earlier in 2017 and was on track to be close to the 2012 record minimum until July. But a cloudy and cooler than normal August slowed the melting. “Weather patterns in August saved the day,” Scambos said. The fast shrinking Arctic ice cap is increasingly thought to have major impacts on extreme weather patterns much further south, due to its influence on the jet stream. Floods, heatwaves and severe winters in Europe, Asia and North America have all been linked to the Arctic meltdown. “It’s bound to have an impact on global climate,” Scambos said. The 2017 sea ice level fits with an overall steady decline over the decades, but one that varies from year to year, Scambos said. “It’s not going to be a staircase heading down to zero every year,” he said. “[But] the Arctic will continue to evolve towards less ice. There’s no dodging that.” Rod Downie, head of polar programmes at WWF, said: “From space, the loss of Arctic sea ice is the clearest and most visible sign of climate change, and human beings are responsible for most of it. We are engineering our planet and its climate.”  “That’s not good for the people of the Arctic who depend upon sea ice for their traditional way of life and for people across the world who depend on a stable climate,” he said. The Arctic could be virtually free of ice in summer within people’s lifetimes, he warned, and called for more action on climate change by reducing carbon emissions."
"How did fear of nuclear holocaust fade so fast? I was brought up at a time when we thought the world would probably end before we got old. But here we still are, the people who were young in the 60s, and so are the H bombs that terrified us. If anything, we are less safe now than back in the heyday of our CND demonstrations. My father was one of the early founders of CND: a former communist who had left the party at the time of the Hitler/Stalin pact; he launched a peace march across Europe to Hungary in the 1950s. He was by nature a millenarian, living in fear of the end of the world in one way or another – and his fears were well-grounded. I went on my first Aldermaston march at 13, after hearing him speak in Trafalgar Square. Unfortunately, as was his wont, he stopped at The Bunch of Grapes pub before the march left Belgravia, and never got any further. But I went for the whole four-day trip, and every year after that, Aldermaston was the great social event for me and my friends.  My father’s fears of nuclear annihilation were so serious that halfway to a holiday in Wales, the family car had to be turned around because he had forgotten the large jar of death pills he had accumulated to mercy-kill everyone in the event of nuclear war. We had read Nevil Shute’s On the Beach. We knew what was coming. We knew exactly what Strontium-90 fallout did to you. We knew that RAF Fylingdales’ early-warning system would give us just four minutes to say goodbye. I carried banners on CND marches listing what you can do in four minutes: boil an egg, run a mile … The songs of those marches have stayed with all who were there: “Don’t you hear the H bombs thunder / Echo like the crack of doom? While they rend the skies asunder / Fallout makes the earth a tomb.” There were many verses. “Time is short; we must be speedy / We can see the hungry filled / House the homeless, help the needy / Shall we blast or shall we build?” The refrain ends “Ban the bomb, for evermore!” But it never happened and the bombs are still here, bequeathed now to our grandchildren. In fact, the world’s armoury has become even more unstable, in the hands of countries not officially sanctioned by the UN to possess them: Pakistan, Israel and now North Korea. Nothing about the replacement of Soviet communism by nationalist dictatorial Putinism makes the rusting Russian nuclear arsenal feel any safer than it was back then. Trump’s tiny finger on the button is terrifying. The risk of terrorists getting their hands on enough nuclear material to make lethal dirty bombs is growing, not shrinking. Already not just nuclear material, but ready-made bombs, have gone missing, or are unaccounted for. No one knows how or when or where. The fear was rekindled with the arrival of cruise missiles at Greenham Common in 1983, launching a second wave of CND activism. But that too faded. Why? The ecological collapse of the planet took over, because it’s actually happening, right now, in the global floods, droughts and forest fires, the hottest years accelerating on the graphs. My father’s end-of-the-world anxiety turned to sustainability - he became an early climate-change campaigner, setting up a commune to grow its own produce, though it was never self-sufficient. He was only half joking when he wagged a finger at me and warned that I would arrive at his door from London, begging for a cabbage, as civilisation collapsed around us. What should we fear most? Which will get us first – nuclear obliteration or the planet boiling? There are many kinds of complacency: the right, by nature, tends to trust that some notional global establishment will somehow sort things out before catastrophe strikes. Or science will fix it just in time. Maybe, as the risks rise, there is a limit to the amount of fear you can feel at any one time, and you are left to shrug helplessly at whatever insanity Kim and Trump may commit. Astronomers know without doubt the world will end, many millennia hence. The question is whether we end it all now, out of sheer human idiocy."

"Tony Abbott has been an implacable force against rational climate action in this country for the best part of a decade, and nothing has changed. Having destroyed one set of energy policies designed to achieve orderly economic transformation and emissions reduction, and created a monumental policy botch-up as a consequence, he’s determined to destroy another.  After warming his vocal cords for months, Abbott now says it would be “unconscionable” for Malcolm Turnbull to “go further down the renewables path”. By this he means implement a clean energy target. Let’s be very clear about this. What is actually unconscionable, and I don’t invoke the word lightly, is Abbott’s own behaviour. Let’s also be very clear about what is happening right now. Abbott wants to lead an insurgency with the aim of sinking Malcolm Turnbull’s climate and energy policy, which is now, and has always been, a proxy for his leadership. Like an armchair general summoning a militia, using his favoured media proxies as loud hailers, the former prime minister has seeded a story that he might cross the floor. If he does cross the floor (as opposed to threatening to, in order to pressure Malcolm Turnbull and Josh Frydenberg into producing the most coal-friendly energy policy imaginable over the next few weeks), with a posse of sharpshooters (Craig Kelly, potentially; George Christensen, who is already on the record as a no vote; a handful of others) it doesn’t mean the policy is dead. The government could still wrangle an energy policy through the parliament with Labor’s support, if it manages to produce a policy framework which Labor can live with (a big if, on current indications, but not impossible). But there’s still a poison pill. If Turnbull does the rational thing and tries to end the climate wars – an outcome which business, the energy sector, climate groups, state governments and many Australian voters are now desperately looking for – then Abbott will characterise this as a fundamental betrayal of conservative values. Turnbull will be signing up with Labor and the Greens, and conspiring in the de-industrialisation of Australia. Being constructive is considered a mortal sin in Australia’s hyperpartisan, knock-down clown politics. Being constructive makes some of the current crop of parliamentarians – now hardwired for a permanent war which is diminishing them and diminishing the country – nervous. So in Abbott’s brutal calculation, it’s heads I win, tails I win. Damage is the ultimate objective. Now before we get to conviction, or the lack thereof, let’s look again at what Abbott has done when he’s had power and opportunity, as opposed to the expression of feelings during his second career delivering careless whispers in Ray Hadley’s locker room, or during staff reunion night on Sky News After Dark. I’ve already pointed out in some detail that Abbott is actually the primary architect of the problem Turnbull is now trying to fix in energy policy. Abbott scrapped the investment mechanism which was legislated to drive orderly transformation in the energy sector and the economy, and left in place the pull-forward mechanism for renewable energy investment, albeit with a lower target. If investment in energy infrastructure is now lopsided, as Abbott contends, we can start by interrogating his own clustercuss. Abbott also agreed Australia would sign up to the Paris international climate accord, which is one of the reasons Australia needs renewable technologies to generate low-emissions electricity. Cause, meet effect. In September 2015, Abbott certainly sounded like he meant to sign up, that this wasn’t some random accident: “Unlike some other countries which make these pledges and don’t deliver, Australia does deliver when we make a pledge.” These are just facts. They are inconvenient facts for Abbott now, which is why he fudges and disavows them, and blames others – but facts they remain. Having reviewed the Abbott record, and noted a gap between present statements and past actions, now let’s consider conviction. Abbott’s behaviour would still be muddle-headed, vengeful, negative and destructive, regardless of his motives – but the most disconcerting thing, from my perch, appears to be the lack of intrinsic values behind the pugilism and the flip-flops. Unburdening himself in Ray’s locker room on Tuesday, Abbott told the 2GB host the government needed to drop the clean energy target, obviously, to make coal great again, that being the preferred virtue-signalling du jour of the reactionary right, which is otherwise completely post-materialist – but also to create a partisan point of difference with Labor at the next election. Let that last point just settle on your mind for a moment. It might take a moment to absorb the vacancy of that statement, because if you absorb its true meaning, you grasp that the person making it is in pure expediency territory. If you are a political leader, you can drop the clean energy target because it is third or fourth worst policy (which is my own view). You certainly can drop it because you’ve got a better idea, and you’ve got a hope of getting your better idea through the parliament. You can certainly shape your policies to work with the politics of the day. But to say let’s drop it to win the next election means you need to be prepared to forget what the country needs, forget what the chief scientist recommends, forget the fact business is now becoming desperate for certainty, forget the fact voters think politics is little better than a stinking carcass – you need to be in a headspace where cheap intra-day political argument triumphs over everything. Forget the substance. More about the wedge. More about me. Onwards, to self-indulgence, to the great unreason, to policy oblivion. That, for me, is the working definition of unconscionable.  • Support our independent journalism by giving a one-off or monthly contribution"
"One of the world’s largest marine protection areas has been created off the coast of Easter Island. The 740,000 sq km Rapa Nui marine park is roughly the size of the Chilean mainland and will protect at least 142 endemic marine species, including 27 threatened with extinction.  An astonishing 77% of the Pacific Ocean’s fish abundance occurs here and recent expeditions discovered several new species previously unknown to science. Apex predators found in the conservation zone include scalloped hammerhead sharks, minke, humpback and blue whales, and four species of sea turtle. Matt Rand, the director of the Pew Bertarelli ocean legacy project, which campaigned for the park, said: “This marine reserve will have a huge global significance for the conservation of oceans and of indigenous people’s ways of life. “The Rapa Nui have long suffered from the loss of timber, declining ecosystems and declining populations. Now they are experiencing a resurgence based on ensuring the health of the oceans.” Plans for the marine park were first announced at a conference in 2015, at which the former US president Barack Obama declared his “special love for the ocean” in a video message.  The plans were confirmed in a speech by Chilean president Michelle Bachelet on Saturday. The marine park’s creation was enabled by a 73% vote in favour of the conservation zone from Easter Island’s 3,000 Rapa Nui population in a referendum on 3 September, after five years of consultations. Extractive industries and industrial fishing will be banned inside the reserve, but the Rapa Nui will be allowed to continue their traditional artisanal fishing on small boats, using hand lines with rocks for weights. Ludovic Burns Tuki, the director of the Mesa del mar coalition of more than 20 Rapa Nui groups, said: “This is a historic moment – a great and beautiful moment for the Rapa Nui, for the world and for our oceans. “We think this process can be an example for the creation of other marine reserves that we need to protect our oceans – with a respect for the human dimension.” After the creation of a comparable marine protection area around the nearby Pitcairn Islands last year, proposals for a reserve in the Austral Islands’ waters could soon create a protected area of more than 2m sq km. This would have a unifying potential for the Polynesian people, according to Burns Tuki. “The ocean is very important to us as a source of food, but the Polynesians were great navigators and the ocean also represents our mother,” he said. “It enables us to move with a double canoe between the different islands. It gives us everything.” As global warming takes hold, some scientific papers suggest that marine reserves may also help mitigate climate change and provide a vital carbon sink. The deep, clear and cool waters around Easter Island are also a resilient area for coral reefs.  Marcelo Mena, Chile’s environment minister, said: “This marine protected area adds to the legacy of President Bachelet and the 1.5m sq km of protected areas created by this government.” The International Union for Conservation of Nature has called for 30% of the world’s oceans to be protected, but only about 1.6% has so far been covered by marine protection areas. "
"It is well known that humans are causing the Earth to warm. We also know that a warmer atmosphere has more water vapor. Just like the air is more humid when it is warm, and less humid when cold. The more humid air leads to more intense precipitation and potentially more flooding. But how much change we will see is an open scientific question. This question is made complex by the fact that flooding isn’t just about rain. It reflects a dependence on evaporation, rain, the ability of land and water management to handle water surges, and other factors. Fortunately, a very recent study out of Science Advances has helped advance our understanding of the confluence of global warming, intense rain and flooding.   The authors, Conrad Wasko and Ashish Sharma, from the University of New South Wales investigated various non-urban catchments. These are regions where precipitation drains to a common site. We know that in many places the rainfall is increasing. What these authors wanted to know was whether there was a coincident increase in floods found in these various catchments. This study isn’t as simple as it might sound. The authors had to make choices about which rainfall event and which temperature peak corresponded to each other and to a potential water flow peak. According to the paper, “precipitation events were identified where the precipitation was separated by five days of zero rainfall.” That is, it had to be dry ahead of time. Streamflow and flooding events were selected as peaks separated by more than seven days. The authors then picked the largest peak from the precipitation and the streamflow observations and matched them to a coincident temperature measurement.  The tough part is that there can be a delay in temperatures and precipitation. Furthermore, there can be a physical distance between the source of the storm and the location of precipitation. Finally, many times we see flooding without the required five-day dry period. So admittedly this study has real limitations. On the other hand, the authors had to make some choices of selection and these are as good as any others. And, they compensated for these limitations by using extensive rainfall, temperature and streamflow data, data that represented the entire world and allows confident conclusions to be drawn. What they found was that in most cases there is no direct link. That is, higher temperatures does not generally cause an increase in water flow or flood risk.  So this begs the question, why not? Why isn’t there a clear direct relationship between the temperature peaks and flooding? Well the authors explain that there is an important role of hydrologic loss (water loss due to evaporation for instance). When the authors separated the results by size of catchment, they found that the importance of these water losses was reduced for smaller catchment areas. They write: if the catchment or region capturing the precipitation is smaller, but the precipitation event intensity remains the same, the potential for losses is less. In large catchments, the peak streamflow is more likely to be influenced by the catchment wetness conditions preceding the storm event.  When they broke the analysis into different catchment sizes, the authors found that for extreme rainfalls, the flooding and temperature move together. The authors also broke analysis into different geographical zones and found that their conclusions held true, regardless of the zone location. As I stated earlier, there are limitations to this study; the authors did a great job discussing those limitations. For instance, they point out it’s possible that human changes to the catchment itself can affect flooding. Urbanization in recent years may have “increased streamflow due to a larger proportion of impermeable surfaces while the development of dams for storage may have had the opposite effect.” They also report that the temperature at which the high water flows are recorded do not necessarily correspond to the temperature of the storm. Evaporation can happen for instance over an ocean, the moisture can be carried hundreds of miles inland, where it falls as rain. But, the fact that their results exclude urban catchments and use data from over 5,000 streamflow and 50,000 rainfall gauges lends credibility to their assertions. So is this good news or bad news? Well, on the one hand it confirms that global warming leads to competing effects of more heavy rains and more drying of land – forces in opposition to each other. Higher temperatures dry out soils faster and they increase precipitation. If the soils are dryer when the rains fall, it means that the floods may be less severe. That is a good thing.  On the other hand, this study helps confirm that the Earth can move from dry to wet conditions more rapidly in a warmer environment. That is not a good thing. It also has implications for refilling groundwater supplies. Much of the recovery from drought and refilling of groundwater is through smaller flooding/high-flow events. Since those are not necessarily increasing, it means droughts are likely to linger. As author Ashish Sharma told me: What this study does is to show, using just data and no model projections, that flood risk is indeed increasing but at the rare to very-rare flood end. The milder floods that are more of a nuisance than a threat to property and lives, are actually decreasing. This is worse news than before though, as it is these milder floods that make up the bulk of the refill to our water supply reservoirs."
"Commonwealth Bank shareholders Guy and Kim Abrahams have dropped their world-first court proceedings against the bank for failing to disclose climate change risks in annual reports. They said CBA’s 2017 annual report, which was published last month, included an acknowledgement for the first time from CBA directors that climate change posed a significant risk to the bank’s operations, with a promise to undertake climate change scenario analysis on its business in the upcoming year to assess the risk. They said those two changes were a big turnaround for the bank and meant their case did not need to proceed. “After years opposing resolutions to improve climate change reporting and refusing to rule out participating in Adani’s Carmichael coalmine, the Commonwealth Bank’s directors have finally acknowledged the seriousness of climate change in the 2017 annual report,” Guy Abrahams said in a statement on Thursday. “Cultural change within the bank has been remarkably slow – the threat of climate change has been evident for decades. “We are pleased the Commonwealth Bank has said it will not fund Adani’s Carmichael coalmine and is taking its first steps in a business-wide review of climate risks.” The Abrahams’ claim, brought by lawyers at Environmental Justice Australia, said CBA’s 2016 directors’ report did not adequately inform investors of climate change risks. They had been seeking an injunction to stop the bank making the same omissions in future annual reports. Their case would have been the first anywhere in the world to test in court how companies are required to disclose climate change-related risks in their annual reports and follows calls by shareholders, regulators and central banks around the world for greater clarity. But less than a week after the Abrahams’ claim was filed in the federal court, CBA published its 2017 annual report, telling shareholders that climate change posed a significant risk to the bank’s operations. It also published its first climate policy position statement, saying it would target an average emissions intensity decrease of its business lending portfolio consistent with its commitment to a net zero emissions economy by 2050. It also said it would not lend money to Adani’s proposed Carmichael coalmine, leaving the controversial project without financing from any of Australia’s big four banks. CBA says it considers climate change is “a significant long-term driver of both financial (credit, market, insurance) and non-financial (operational, compliance, reputation) risks” and it has pledged to develop a long-term strategy to manage its response to climate change. “In line with the recommendations by the Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures and the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority (Apra), we are undertaking a scenario analysis to inform and guide the longer-term strategy,” CBA has said. David Barnden, a lawyer for the shareholders, said CBA’s climate change policy had still been criticised for failing to phase out investments in industries like thermal coal that exacerbate climate change.  “The Commonwealth Bank has been a long-time laggard on telling its shareholders about climate risks, so this is an important change,” he said on Thursday. “Under the Corporations Act, directors of Australian companies must give shareholders information about financial risks. CBA now acknowledges climate change is a material financial risk to the bank.” In February, Apra warned that climate change posed a material risk to Australia’s entire financial system and urged companies to start adapting. Geoff Summerhayes from Apra said companies must start incorporating sophisticated “scenario-based analysis” of climate risks into their business outlooks. He said Apra intended to start running stress tests of the financial system to see if it would survive various adverse climate shocks. Barnden said lawyers acting for Guy and Kim Abrahams had been working pro bono. The Commonwealth Bank has welcomed the fact that proceedings have been dropped, saying allegations the bank was not compliant with its statutory reporting obligations were incorrect. “Claims that such action has changed how CBA reports on climate change are untrue, with our 2016 and 2017 annual reports being compliant with statutory reporting obligations,” a spokesman said. “The section in the 2017 annual report regarding climate change as a business risk was the result of careful and extensive consideration over many months by the board and senior executives and was already well advanced when the claim was served.”"
"For the sake of keeping things manageable, let’s confine the discussion to a single continent and a single week: North America over the last seven days. In Houston they got down to the hard and unromantic work of recovery from what economists announced was probably the most expensive storm in US history, and which weather analysts confirmed was certainly the greatest rainfall event ever measured in the country – across much of its spread it was a once-in-25,000-years storm, meaning 12 times past the birth of Christ; in isolated spots it was a once-in-500,000-years storm, which means back when we lived in trees. Meanwhile, San Francisco not only beat its all-time high temperature record, it crushed it by 3F, which should be pretty much statistically impossible in a place with 150 years (that’s 55,000 days) of record-keeping. That same hot weather broke records up and down the west coast, except in those places where a pall of smoke from immense forest fires kept the sun shaded – after a forest fire somehow managed to jump the mighty Columbia river from Oregon into Washington, residents of the Pacific Northwest reported that the ash was falling so thickly from the skies that it reminded them of the day Mount St Helens erupted in 1980. That same heat, just a little farther inland, was causing a “flash drought” across the country’s wheat belt of North Dakota and Montana – the evaporation from record temperatures had shrivelled grain on the stalk to the point where some farmers weren’t bothering to harvest at all. In the Atlantic, of course, Irma was barrelling across the islands of the Caribbean (“It’s like someone with a lawnmower from the sky has gone over the island,” said one astounded resident of St Maarten). The storm, the first category five to hit Cuba in a hundred years, is currently battering the west coast of Florida after setting a record for the lowest barometric pressure ever measured in the Keys, and could easily break the 10-day-old record for economic catastrophe set by Harvey; it’s definitely changed the psychology of life in Florida for decades to come. Oh, and while Irma spun, Hurricane Jose followed in its wake as a major hurricane, while in the Gulf of Mexico, Katia spun up into a frightening storm of her own, before crashing into the Mexican mainland almost directly across the peninsula from the spot where the strongest earthquake in 100 years had taken dozens of lives. Leaving aside the earthquake, every one of these events jibes with what scientists and environmentalists have spent 30 fruitless years telling us to expect from global warming. (There’s actually fairly convincing evidence that climate change is triggering more seismic activity, but there’s no need to egg the pudding.) That one long screed of news from one continent in one week (which could be written about many other continents and many other weeks – just check out the recent flooding in south Asia for instance) is a precise, pixelated portrait of a heating world. Because we have burned so much oil and gas and coal, we have put huge clouds of CO2 and methane in the air; because the structure of those molecules traps heat the planet has warmed; because the planet has warmed we can get heavier rainfalls, stronger winds, drier forests and fields. It’s not mysterious, not in any way. It’s not a run of bad luck. It’s not Donald Trump (though he’s obviously not helping). It’s not hellfire sent to punish us. It’s physics. Maybe it was too much to expect that scientists’ warnings would really move people. (I mean, I wrote The End of Nature, the first book about all this 28 years ago this week, when I was 28 – and when my theory was still: “People will read my book, and then they will change.”) Maybe it’s like all the health warnings that you should eat fewer chips and drink less soda, which, to judge by belt-size, not many of us pay much mind. Until, maybe, you go to the doctor and he says: “Whoa, you’re in trouble.” Not “keep eating junk and some day you’ll be in trouble”, but: “You’re in trouble right now, today. As in, it looks to me like you’ve already had a small stroke or two.” Hurricanes Harvey and Irma are the equivalent of one of those transient ischaemic attacks – yeah, your face is drooping oddly on the left, but you can continue. Maybe. If you start taking your pills, eating right, exercising, getting your act together. That’s the stage we’re at now – not the warning on the side of the pack, but the hacking cough that brings up blood. But what happens if you keep smoking? You get worse, till past a certain point you’re not continuing. We’ve increased the temperature of the Earth a little more than 1C so far, which has been enough extra heat to account for the horrors we’re currently witnessing. And with the momentum built into the system, we’re going to go somewhere near 2C, no matter what we do. That will be considerably worse than where we are now, but maybe it will be expensively endurable. The problem is, our current business-as-usual trajectory takes us to a world that’s about 3.5C warmer. That is to say, even if we kept the promises we made at Paris (which Trump has already, of course, repudiated) we’re going to build a planet so hot that we can’t have civilisations. We have to seize the moment we’re in right now – the moment when we’re scared and vulnerable – and use it to dramatically reorient ourselves. The last three years have each broken the record for the hottest year ever measured – they’re a red flashing sign that says: “Snap out of it.” Not bend the trajectory somewhat, as the Paris accords envisioned, but simultaneously jam on the fossil fuel brakes and stand on the solar accelerator (and also find some metaphors that don’t rely on internal combustion). This is a race against time. Global warming is a crisis that comes with a limit – solve it soon or don’t solve it We could do it. It’s not technologically impossible – study after study has shown we can get to 100% renewables at a manageable cost, more manageable all the time, since the price of solar panels and windmills keeps plummeting. Elon Musk is showing you can churn out electric cars with ever-lower sticker shock. In remote corners of Africa and Asia, peasants have begun leapfrogging past fossil fuel and going straight to the sun. The Danes just sold their last oil company and used the cash to build more windmills. There are just enough examples to make despair seem like the cowardly dodge it is. But everyone everywhere would have to move with similar speed, because this is in fact a race against time. Global warming is the first crisis that comes with a limit – solve it soon or don’t solve it. Winning slowly is just a different way of losing. Winning fast enough to matter would mean, above all, standing up to the fossil fuel industry, so far the most powerful force on Earth. It would mean postponing other human enterprises and diverting other spending. That is, it would mean going on a war-like footing: not shooting at enemies, but focusing in the way that peoples and nations usually only focus when someone’s shooting at them. And something is. What do you think it means when your forests are on fire, your streets are underwater, and your buildings are collapsing? • Bill McKibben is a writer and the founder of the climate campaign 350.org"
"The Cassini mission, which will end on Friday, is one of the most wonderful achievements of the human race. A slack-jawed awe is the only proper reaction to the spacecraft’s travels and to its intricate route over seven years to Saturn, aided by the slingshot effects of its grazing the orbits of the inner planets, first Venus and then Earth, as it passed them in vast loops, representing astonishing feats of calculation. Nor was it enough just to reach the outer planets and their region of immense distances from the Sun, from us and from each other. The flypasts of Jupiter and its moons, reached after three years, and then the orbit of Saturn attained four years later, are wonders of remote control and communication. The pictures that Cassini has sent back of the surface of the moons it has explored – and it actually landed the smaller probe, Huygens, on one of them – enlarge our vision of the universe as nothing else could.  Now that the probe has spent 12 years in orbit around Saturn and among its moons, the end is close. It is being deliberately steered into the atmosphere to avoid its remains contaminating two of the moons where the presence of liquid water suggests that life in some form might evolve or even have evolved already. We can be proud, as members of a technological civilisation, that we reached the point where we were faced with the chance of infecting entirely hypothetical alien bacteria with our debris, and proud, too, that we chose not to do so. This act of self-conscious renunciation is not the dream which first fired the exploration of space. That was fuelled by an aggressive and apparently inexhaustible confidence. Travel to the stars was our manifest destiny and it would put to altruistic use the competitive instincts of the human race. The confidence may have reached its peak at a dark moment in 1944; war was raging across Europe, and Hitler unleashed his long-threatened secret weapon against England. The members of the nascent British Interplanetary Society (BIS), meeting in a London pub, cheered when they heard the explosion of a V2 rocket because they understood that this meant rockets worked, whatever the price in civilian lives. Even the sombre grandeur of Olaf Stapledon’s Last and First Men, which ends with the extinction of the last post-human race, is infused with an irresistible outward urge. It is nearly 50 years since the Apollo programme first put men on the moon; nearly 45 since the last man walked on soil not of Earth. The rocket technology which the optimists of the BIS cheered on is now in the news only when North Korea tests a missile that threatens millions of civilians. As for the world government which seemed such a natural and inevitable progression from space flight in all but the most dystopian science fiction, that seems much further than ever. Instead, we have a possible and partial revival of manned space exploration. The Chinese government seems to want an expedition to the moon; the billionaire Elon Musk plans private space tourism, perhaps as far as Mars, although there is considerable scepticism about his prospects. Nasa itself has a hugely ambitious project under way to send a manned flight to Mars some time after 2030. But there is a note of sinister farce over all these efforts, supplied by the involvement of Donald Trump, who has a juvenile enthusiasm for space travel. In the spring, Mr Trump called the international space station to speak to Peggy Whitson, the US astronaut who had just become the American who had spent most consecutive time in space, and told her that he wanted a manned Mars mission within the time of his presidency. But at the same time, his government threatens to undermine the funding of Nasa’s priceless surveys of our own planet, which are providing hard data about the effects of climate change or, as the Republican party sees it, “politicised science”. The turn towards Earth and away from manned space missions was made explicit under Barack Obama in 2010, and it corresponds with the feeling among space scientists that for purely scientific purposes, there is nothing much that humans can accomplish which robots cannot do as well, more cheaply, and with less risk of tragedy. It would be wonderful to land a human being on Mars and then to bring them home again, but it is not nearly as urgent as preserving the habitat for the billions of us who are left on Earth. • This article was amended on 12 September 2017 because an earlier version said that it had been nearly 60 years since men first stepped on the moon and almost 50 since the last manned landing. This has been corrected."

"Congratulations Australia. Two years have passed without a leadership coup being launched against a sitting prime minister. In our unhinged system, that level of stability is a genuine achievement. So, hooray for #auspol. Except the voters are still ropeable, and politics doesn’t feel all that stable, does it?  Old debates churn round in enervating circles, deeply silly business persists, and one of Malcolm Turnbull’s rewards for surviving two years in the top job was a harrowing account of Tony Abbott’s wounding and scarring exit from the prime ministership “at the height of his political career” in the Daily Telegraph on Friday. Poor old Tony (the paper’s political editor, Sharri Markson, noted by way of exposition) didn’t like talking about his emotions, “like most men”. But given opportunity, Wronged Tony™ rose nimbly to the occasion. Of course losing the prime ministership was wounding. “Of course you carry scars,” Abbott noted, movingly. Not being prime minister still hurts, but you just have to put disappointments behind you “and make the most of every day and that’s what I’m doing”. It certainly is what he’s doing. Fortunately for him, sorrow seems a healthy working distance from Abbott’s daily default disposition. This week, the former prime minister took a day off from his parliamentary duties to help put out bushfires. That made a refreshing change from lighting them – metaphorically of course. Two years after his own party ran him out of Dodge, Abbott is not ubiquitous in the political landscape, but he’s determined to be assertively present, a little pulse of mischief. He’s present in the marriage equality debate, defending religious freedom, holding back the scourge of progressivism – although it is mildly curious that the public running on that issue at the moment has defaulted to John Howard, rather than the member for Warringah, almost as if there has been a subtle baton change. Abbott is also making noise in the government’s fraught energy debate, having warmed his jets on the tarmac on that issue for some months, telling that nice Ben Fordham on 2GB all about his plans for a “100% reliable energy target” – a policy that carries the mild inconvenience of being technically impossible to deliver, given no energy system is ever 100% reliable. But then targets are, presumably, strictly optional for a political leader who willingly signed Australia up to the Paris climate agreement, and now says we don’t have to do anything serious on emissions reductions, because international agreements are not a “straitjacket”. While Abbott is never one for fine policy detail, or constrained particularly by facts in the crafting of a deft political argument, he’s been very determined to front run the inevitable crab walk by the government in the direction of coal. The government is in the middle of its energy policy crab walk, and has picked a partisan fight with Labor, and the energy company AGL, to kick up sufficient dust for shellshocked Coalition MPs to get their tails up, and allow the cabinet to get on with settling the new investment framework. The energy plan is in transition, right before our eyes. The volume is being turned right down on the clean energy target recommended by the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, and we are moving clearly in the direction of an overhaul of national electricity market rules. The market operator wants a day-ahead market, which allows better planning to ensure sufficient quantities of dispatchable energy are available in the system, and there is talk of a shift to a capacity market, which exists in Western Australia. While the rule changes look sensible, how any clean energy target fits with an energy market overhaul remains a bit moot, except it’s clear that if it survives, the level of ambition for emissions reduction will fall below the already low level aspired for in Finkel’s report.  If all this comes to pass, the question will be about how can Australia meet it Paris climate change target – the one Turnbull says is not aspirational, despite what you might hear on 2GB every Wednesday afternoon and every second Monday morning. The next question will be whether the government can get its energy policy fix through parliament – or whether it actually wants to fail on that front in order to dust off the old political fight with Labor over climate policy and energy. Could it think that failing to fix this mess up is the viable path, politically, to winning the next election? Out in the real world, tolerance for such antics is low, but the picking of the old partisan fight has been mildly positive for morale among government MPs, as has the postal ballot’s survival against the high court challenge. You’d think shouting your way, incoherently, to victory would be impossible, absurd, ridiculous – except that modern politics is really a curious business. Shouting furiously about things often substitutes, successfully, for doing them. One little reported example this week can tell you a story about what sort of collective hole #auspol is in, when it comes to posturing and blathering being more important than substance. In the media policy debate, the main verb of the political week, the Australian Conservatives senator Cory Bernardi drafted some amendments that would have allowed One Nation to vote for the deal it had negotiated with the government. Let me step through this carefully lest I get confusing. Several weeks ago, the One Nation bloc gave the Coalition its support for the government’s long-planned overhaul of the media landscape – the one that is going to make the Australian media sector even more concentrated in terms of ownership than it already is – in return for some nasty business against the ABC. The ink was no sooner dry on that agreement when it became clear it was an agreement in air quotes – a deal in name only. Being nasty to the ABC would require changes to completely separate pieces of legislation, not the broadcasting bill now before parliament, and no one else in the parliament was that interested in being nasty to the ABC, mass political suicide not really being in contemplation. Bernardi, who is of course in competition with One Nation for votes, thought he’d fix that problem for them by drafting detailed amendments grafting the ABC changes to the bill immediately before parliament. See Pauline, I’m delivering your deal, Bernardi said – cherubic. So did One Nation go ahead and vote for Bernardi’s amendments to deliver their own deal with the government? Well, no, it did not. The senators hovered outside the chamber during the division, abstaining from the vote to deliver their wish list. The numbers weren’t there in parliament to legislate the Bernardi amendment, but that doesn’t explain why One Nation refused to vote for, wait for it ... its own deal. Dare we suggest it is more important to have a Facebook live event moaning about the ABC than doing anything concrete to follow through on your moaning? It would seem Australian politics really can be that postmodern."
