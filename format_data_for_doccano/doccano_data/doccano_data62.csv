"Doreen Auciello, 63, was finishing a continental breakfast in a hotel in Daytona Beach, Florida – home of the famous speedway races. As she sat with her good friend Gene, who recently lost her husband, their conversation and that of everyone else in the room revolved around Hurricane Dorian, just offshore.  Floridians are used to dealing with hurricane season. It’s hard to deny that the storms are getting stronger, although there is plenty of disagreement as to why. Scientists have been warning that warmer ocean temperatures and higher sea levels are expected to intensify the hurricanes’ impacts. Auciello is retired and lives alone. Her 1967 vintage mobile home, which she bought for $8,000, is all she owns. She knows it could suffer damage and she has no insurance. “No one would insure a 1967 mobile home,” she said. “I don’t know what I’m going to do if it’s destroyed, I’ll be homeless.” She came to Daytona to be close to her sister and indulge in the idea of Florida being paradise. “Florida is like the dreamland. Until you’ve gone through a major hurricane, you don’t know what it’s really like here,” she said. She accepts the facts of the climate crisis. “It’s just not the same as the years go by, all of these storms are just getting worse and worse. Nobody is really taking it seriously and it’s way too late now. You can’t reverse it – the damage, you know.” Auciello had lined herself up a coffee, an orange juice and a strawberry smoothie to get through the day. Regardless of the widespread news coverage of how vulnerable the state is to storm damage, the dream endures: it’s estimated that more than 900 people move to Florida every day. Dorian’s eye was approaching Daytona Beach on Wednesday but the Carolinas now expect the brunt of the storm. Stacy Givens, a Daytona local, believes God is trying to tell us something. “He’s shaking up the world,” she exclaimed, as rather terrifying waves surged up to the sea wall. Rather than a climate crisis spurred by human action, Givens thinks the increasingly frequent monster hurricanes are all part of a divine plan. Many residents on the adjacent barrier island decided not to evacuate. “[The hurricanes] are what they are, they’re going to come whether I’m here or not. I can’t afford to move anyplace else,” said 52-year-old Jim Bordain. He came to the beach to look for any special washed-up shells, which, he said, appear every time a hurricane comes. Like those of many Floridians, his views on climate science can best be described as conspiratorial. “Organizations that want to have control over other people are trying to make more out of the global warming so that they can dictate how business is run and how we use our vehicles,” Bordain explained. Florida is a transient place. People often come to escape their past lives or to seek a comfortable retirement. James Bagwell, 41, has lived in Daytona Beach since 2011. He remodels homes and is struggling financially with being out of work for five days. He thought Dorian was “taking too long” to play out. As the storm paused, catastrophically, over the Bahamas on Labor Day, nerves were fraying in north-east Florida. “I have a little bit of money set aside for emergencies, but not enough for more than five days,” Bagwell said. He sees this extreme weather as part of the cycle of life. “It’s probably nature. If you look at the dinosaurs, they were wiped out by something,” he says. “Maybe it’s close to the time for humans to be wiped out by something and start the next evolutionary ladder.” According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), five of the 10 strongest Atlantic storms have occurred in the last 10 years. Yet many citizens of Florida are confused when it comes to the origins of hurricanes, and how the human-caused climate crisis is steadily making them more dangerous. Florida has a long political history of climate science denial, which culminated in the former governor Rick Scott, now a US senator, allegedly banning the words “climate change” from any internal government communications. Scott is evolving, however. Now, an unwelcome serving of reality is being delivered to those in power, and it’s becoming increasingly hard to sustain the delusion. The Florida senator Marco Rubio, a sharp skeptic in the past, has called recommended actions in scientific reports are “alarmism” but now admits that climate change is a “real problem”. As a result of these policymakers and their predecessors, the Sunshine state still gets far more of its power from burning coal and natural gas than from renewables, and mass transit systems have struggled to gain traction. But the ever-stronger hurricanes and rising seas affect everyone, regardless of political persuasion, so the center ground of the discussion is finally shifting, forcing even science deniers to make statements acknowledging global heating is happening. The recently elected Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, has hired the state’s first chief resilience officer. Her job is to “prepare Florida for the environmental, physical and economic impacts of climate change, especially sea-level rise”."

"Many early pictures of towns and villages that survive in archives were taken when snow was covering streets and roofs. Even considering the obvious attractiveness to photographers of snow scenes these many images must mean such snowfalls were fairly commonplace. In this century many places in the south of the UK would be hard put to capture such picturesque scenes again because it rarely snows, and then melts within hours.  Even more striking are the occasional archive pictures of hoarfrost. One Victorian picture of a local church with the branches and twigs of trees turned white by the frost brought back memories of waiting for the school bus, aged five, and wondering if my fingers might freeze and snap off before it arrived. In Norfolk everything, trees, houses, even the bus stop were covered in white crystals – not snow but frost. The temperature had not risen above freezing for days. The fact that this rarely happens now is borne out by new research published in Geophysical Research letters that show that so-called “cold” days in European winters are on average 3C warmer than 70 years ago. In the UK this makes it far less likely that temperatures will remain below freezing all day, a prerequisite for hoarfrost to build up so everything is white. "

Share this...FacebookTwitterFundamental tenets of the CO2 greenhouse effect hyphothesis aren’t supported by real-world, observed evidence. 
Image Source: Kennedy and Hodzic, 2019
I. CO2 warms the planet by 7.2°C?
According to the IPCC and other sources, when CO2’s atmospheric concentration ranges between 0.03% and 0.04% (300-400 parts per million, or ppm), it literally warms the air by 7.2°C within the Earth’s 33°C greenhouse effect.

Image Source: Boersema and Reijnders, 2009
Problematically, at no time has it been empirically demonstrated in a real-world experiment that CO2 warms air by this temperature at this concentration. (Or any concentration.)
CO2’s capacity to warm air by 7.2°C is an non-validated assumption derived from the arbitrary estimation that CO2’s warming influence contributes about 20-25% to the Earth’s 33°C greenhouse effect.
II. Lab experiments using CO2 as a causal variable fail to demonstrate its warming effect
Classroom lab experiments that use pure (1,000,000 ppm) CO2 in one container and air (N2, O2) in another to demonstrate the CO2 container warms more than the air container are only illustrating that CO2 molecules are heavier than nitrogen and oxygen molecules.
Heavier CO2 molecules “reduce heat transfer by suppressing convective mixing with the ambient air” (Wagoner et al., 2010).
In other words, the CO2 molecules aren’t warming the container via their radiative properties, but due to the density differential for CO2 relative to N2 and O2.

Image Source: Wagoner et al., 2010
Another experiment (Allmendinger, 2016), again using pure (100%) CO2 in a container, compared the radiative absorption properties of CO2 to that of argon, helium, and air (nitrogen and oxygen).

//-->




Surprisingly, Dr. Allmendinger found that the capacity to absorb radiation (sunlight) was quite similar for CO2 and for argon, nitrogen, and oxygen. The latter 3 are non-greenhouse gases.
Nitrogen and oxygen together constitute 99% of the atmosphere. Argon’s atmospheric representation is 0.93% (9,300 ppm) and CO2 is 0.041% (410 ppm).
In the experiment, pure CO2 was used. And the limiting absorption temperature for pure CO2 molecules wasn’t significantly different than the far more atmospherically abundant non-radiative gases.
As Allmedinger summarizes, this means that “a significant effect of carbon-dioxide on the direct sunlight absorption can already be excluded.”

Image Source: Allmendinger, 2016
III. Scientists insist the CO2 greenhouse effect is built on assumption and lacks empirical support
In a new paper, Kennedy and Hodzic, 2019 summarize the lack of real-world, observational support for the claim CO2 molecules elicit planetary heating in the process of explicating their postion that water vapor is the gas that dominates the Earth’s greenhouse effect.
They point out that the “critical assumption” that CO2 molecules reduce outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) to warm the Earth’s surface “lacks empirical confirmation.”
A graphic of OLR variability (Figure 1) from the paper demonstrates that “none” of the variation can be attributed to CO2’s influence.
Kennedy and Hodzic sum up their skepticism about CO2’s greenhouse effect influence by saying 1) “the effect of any increases in [CO2’s] concentration can only be theoretically inferred”; 2) other than by correlation or curve-fitting, there is no  “direct verification possible for the greenhouse effect of CO2”; and 3) there is no realized “clear spectral signal available showing significantly reduced OLR from increasing CO2.”
In other words, the specific greenhouse effect warming properties of CO2 have not been validated scientifically.

"Australians are increasingly concerned about droughts and floods, extinctions and water shortages associated with climate change, and most people think all levels of government aren’t doing enough to combat the effects of global warming, according to new research. The annual Climate of the Nation survey, which has been tracking Australian attitudes to climate change for more than a decade, finds concern about droughts and flooding has risen from 74% of the survey in 2017 to 81% in 2019. Concern about climate-related extinctions – an issue highlighted dramatically in May when a major scientific report warned that a million species across the world faced extinction – has risen from 71% in 2017 to 78% in the 2019 survey, while concern about water shortages, an issue front of mind as a consequence of Australia’s prolonged drought, has increased from 67% to 78%. Public sentiment about phasing out coal has also shifted in the past few years. In 2017 65% of the survey thought coal power stations should be phased out gradually to help manage the costs of the transition, but the percentage has dropped to 52% in 2019. The percentage of people believing the shift from coal to clean energy needs to be accelerated, even if the transition costs more in the short term, has increased from 19% in 2017 to 26% in 2019. There has also been an increase in the percentage of people in the survey arguing that Australia should completely end coal-fired power generation within the next 10 years. In 2017 30% of the survey agreed, and in 2019 39% agreed. In Queensland – where the future of coal was a significant issue in the May federal election – 49% of the sample thought coal power stations should be phased out gradually and 24% said as soon as possible. • Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Just over half the national sample, 51%, said they would support a moratorium on new coalmines (including 49% of Liberal voters and 53% of Labor voters). While parliamentary Nationals are the most vocal supporters of the coal industry, the survey suggests their voting constituency is split, with 48% supporting a moratorium, 40% opposing it and 12% undecided. It’s a similar picture for One Nation, another vocal supporter of coal in Canberra – 41% of One Nation supporters supported a moratorium, 36% opposed one, and 22% undecided. The annual survey, conducted by YouGov/Galaxy, has assessed attitudes to climate change since 2007. The now defunct Climate Institute began the series, and it is now managed by the progressive thinktank the Australia Institute. The survey is national and it has a margin of error of plus or minus 2%. The research will be launched in Canberra on Tuesday by the independent who unseated Tony Abbott in the May election, Zali Steggall, in part on a platform of climate action. “Australians are rightly concerned about more extreme heatwaves, droughts and bushfires and they want the Morrison government to show leadership on climate change and do more to prepare for the impacts that are already locked in,” Steggall said. “This latest report shows that Australians support far more ambitious climate and energy policies than the federal government is currently delivering.” The 2019 survey found that 77% of respondents agreed that climate change is happening (equal to the percentage in 2016), and 61% said warming is caused by humans. For context, 64% of the sample agreed climate change was happening in 2012, 19% weren’t sure and 17% said it wasn’t happening. Now it is 77% agreement, 11% unsure and 12% said it isn’t happening. Just under half the sample, 48%, said climate change is already causing more heatwaves and hot days – a nine-point increase in a year – and just over half the sample (51%, up from 43% a year ago) thought climate change is behind the melting of the polar ice caps. More than half the sample, 64%, wanted Australia to adopt a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and 56% of the sample wanted Australia to limit global warming to 1.5C. The survey indicates nuclear energy, which has been revived as a prospect by some Morrison government MPs, remains divisive with voters. Only one in five put nuclear in their top three preferred energy sources, and 59% of the survey put nuclear in their bottom three. Breaking down the responses by demographics, women were more worried about climate change than men and, speaking generally, young people were more worried than respondents aged over 55. Looking at perceptions in the city versus perceptions in regional Australia, people in metropolitan areas were more likely to agree that coal plants should be closed and replaced with cleaner alternatives (64% to 55%), and city dwellers were more likely to support a moratorium on new mines than regional Australians (55% to 46%). People in the regions were more aware than their city counterparts that Australia is a signatory to the Paris agreement (62% to 57%) and more likely to blame the energy companies for high power prices (64% to 53%). The climate and energy director at the Australia Institute, Richie Merzian, said of a looming UN climate summit in New York: “The public want to see the Australian government take a leadership role when it comes to global action on climate change.”"

Currently green energy proponents are pushing to significantly ease restrictions against the construction of wind parks, and don’t want to hear any complaints from pesky local citizens. But resistance to projects has reached a massive scale.

Across the country people have come to realize that although the produced electricity from wind is CO2 emissions free, the massive environmental impacts the huge industrial contraptions are having on the landscape, regional environment and public health risks aren’t worth it.
Local citizens reject planned local wind park
Today we find another powerful example of how wind projects planned near communities are being overwhelmingly rejected.
Near the North German community of Ovelgönnes, citizens shot down plans to build a wind park comprising four 200-meter tall Vesta 126 wind turbines each with a rated capacity of 3.45 MW, reports the daily Nordwest Zeitung (NWZ).

The generator hub height is planned for 137 meters, close to 200 meters at the tip of the blade.
In mid January, local citizens gathered for an information evening aimed at explaining what the project was about. But as reported by the NWZ, the project proponents were met with “severe opposition” to their plans. The article described the information meeting as “charged with emotion”.
One local resident claimed: “Here personal effort for profits is being placed above the common good.” Another resident accused the project supporters of “putting public health at risk”.
Only 600 meters setback
A preliminary plan by wind park builder Windstrom shows that the turbines would be a mere 600 meters away from the nearest homes and only 1000 meters from the community of Großenmeer, east of the proposed park.

Rejected 269 – 11
The project went to a vote earlier this week, reported the Nordwest Zeitung (NWZ). The result was devastating: only 11 (4%) were in favor of the park, 269 (94%) were against.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn these times when legitimate, qualified and alternative voices and opinions on science are being snuffed out by the mainstream and social media, e.g.: on issues related to the Corona lock down and the causes behind climate change, many worry that our fundamental rights are being infringed.

“I’ve been called on to save you!” Führers like claiming they represent overwhelming “consensus”, the Association of German Historians warns. Image: Science Skeptical
The Association of German Historians (VHD, Verband der Historiker und Historikerinnen Deutschlands) has issued a statement on “Current Threats to Democracy“, warning against populism.
The scientists at the German Die kalte Sonne site here noted, however, the often claimed “97% consensus” in climate science “sounds despicable and reminds us of the election results of autocratic regimes”. How does science actually work and how does democracy work?”
To shed some light on this, here’s what the Association of German Historians writes on its website:

For parliamentary democracy and a pluralistic culture of debate, against populism

In pluralistic democracies, public policy is the result of open debates in which a variety of political opinions and social interests are expressed. A unified will of the people that can be discerned by those regarding themselves as ‘called’  is, in contrast, a fiction, used by people in political debates primarily for the purpose of making themselves invulnerable. In the Weimar Republic, the idea of ‘the people’s will’ smoothed the way to power for a movement whose ‘Führer’ saw himself as the incarnation of that will.
[…] Also, in light of colonial violence committed by Europeans in other parts of the world, it is crucial to acknowledge our shared responsibility for the consequences of our policies in regions outside of Europe.”
Of course this message is aimed at the White House and to other capitals that aren’t popular with the European elitist establishment nowadays. Unfortunately, these warnings need to be heeded by the elitist European policymakers and activists the VHD likes to laud and defend. Lately European mainstream media, elitists and activists have been insulting and slandering experts who have come forward to express dissenting views.
In Germany climate and lock down dissenters – who are in fact experts – are routinely slandered as “deniers”, charlatans”, “right-wingers”, crackpots – or worse.
The grave consequences of baseless fear
Meanwhile, the fake-science-based “climate crisis” – resulting from am authoritarian shutdown of “open debate” and opposing opinion – is already having grave consequences on our youth.

The northern hemisphere surface temperature was expected to drop substantially according to NCEP, but this of course will not keep global warming alarmists from sounding the warming alarms.
But a look at the unadjusted data from some rural US stations tells us that there has been no warming.
Today we look at temperature data from NASA of some stations along the northern US with a Brightness Index (BI) of 0, meaning rural locations with no urban heat island effects. We want to see the trend over the past 100 or so years.
Plotted are the USHCN Version 4 versus Version 4 adjusted.
The first plots are the data from Lincoln, Nebraska going back to 1901:

Modest cooling changed to warming. Data: NASA. 
Note how a modest cooling trend was changed to a warming trend. Very ealy temperatures were cooled by 2°C!
Next we move to the Livingston, Montana station, where here as well a modest cooling trend was transformed into warming by massively adjusting past temperatures downward also by more than 2°C:

Data: NASA
The story is similar for the New Salem, North Dakota station, where earlier temperatures were adjusted downward by more than 1°C in order to produce a meaningful warming trend:

Data: NASA
Moving to the northern US state of Minnesota, we plot the data for the Artichoke Lake station going back over 100 years. Once again the past was cooled by NASA number-crunchers:

Data: NASA
Here an insignificant warming was suddenly amplified to about 1°C per century.
Finally we compare the GHCN unadjusted to the adjusted data at Harbour Beach, Michigan, where we see a slight cooling trend over the past 120 years was changed to a warming trend:

Data: NASA
In summary rural US areas without urban impacts have raw data showing cooling or almost no warming for the past 100 years. But NASA revisions wiped out it out produced a history of warming.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA comment by PhD physicist David Appell, a contributing writer to Scientific American and Nature,  shows he does not understand the fundamental climate-driving mechanism of water evaporation in a recent comment. 

Amazon rain forest still exists despite very warm, year-round temperatures. Image cropped: NASA
Many readers are familiar with climate alarm dogmatist David Appell. He sometimes goes off on comment tirades here at NTZ, getting huffed up.
Though a large part of his dogma-filled comments fail to meet editorial standards, and so don’t get published, some have merit and are welcome.
Doesn’t understand evaporation
Recently I decided to leave up one of his comments, though it was a falsehood. I did so because it illustrates how this Physics PhD really does not even understand the basic physics behind water evaporation – a critical element in our climate system. If you don’t understand how evaporation works, how can you possibly understand how climate works, let alone model it?
Appell’s gaffe comment came in response to the recent NTZ article: “Alarmist Claims Of Increasing European Drought Are A Myth“, to which he commented:

Though it may be counter-intuitive to some, Appell’s statement is false. Indeed many laypersons believe that heat (higher temperatures) do dry things out. For example, we throw our wet clothes in the dryer because “the heat dries them”. But it isn’t quite so. Heat is not what dries, and PhD physicist David Appell really should know better. Drying depends on the relative humidity, and not on temperature.
Wet jungles, desert polar regions
According to Mr. Appell’s understanding, hot jungles, where hot temperatures of 35°C persist, should have dried out long ago. But they haven’t. They don’t dry out because of their high relative humidity that keeps them green and lush. It has nothing to do with temperature.
In fact, as reader Yonason points out, some of the largest deserts in the world are located in extremely cold regions. Temperature is not what drives drought! Lack of moisture is what does it, and nothing else. In fact, the driest periods on earth have occurred in cold periods.
Other “experts” also misunderstood
David Appell is not the only “expert” who misunderstand what drives evaporation. German “expert” Volker Quaschning also misunderstood it last year. Veteran Swiss meteorologist Jörg Kachelmann had to sit him down and school him on the subject. It’s no wonder many alarmists and modelers have been so wrong when it comes to climate change.
Lack of quality control
And one really has to pause and wonder about the quality control at renowned publications like Scientific American and Nature, who Appell claims he has written for,  that they would print material from persons who clearly do not understand the fundamental physics of water vapor – a crucial component of our climate system.

"Hundreds of cyclists took part in a staged funeral procession in central London on Saturday before performing a “die-in” near Whitehall to call for greater investment in walking and cycling. The protest, organised by the campaign groups Extinction Rebellion and Stop Killing Cyclists, drew attention to statistics showing that more than 100 cyclists were killed and 3,400 seriously injured in 2016, the most recent year for which figures were available.  Three horse-drawn hearses carrying coffins led the procession from Lincoln’s Inn Fields along the Strand, as signs saying “Asthma”, “Crashes”, “Obesity” and “Climate” highlighted the impact of car travel. A small child’s coffin commemorated the children and adults who have died prematurely from diseases related to air pollution. The 10-minute “die-in” was initially scheduled to take place outside the Treasury, but police asked the activists to congregate next to Trafalgar Square due to a separate, concurrent anti-government protest outside Downing Street. As sombre, pre-recorded funeral music played by bagpipes rang out, protesters demanded an ecological and climate emergency autumn budget with £6bn to be invested in walking and cycling. “Transport is the largest greenhouse gas-emitting sector in the UK,” Caspar Hughes, an organiser at Stop Killing Cyclists, said. “Cycling campaigning is climate campaigning. The die-in is symbolic of all the people who have lost their lives due to traffic violence, pollution and the climate. He said the spending review was “laughable” and criticised what he said was a stark imbalance between investment in cycling infrastructure and the expansion of the road network. Donnachadh McCarthy, the co-founder of Stop Killing Cyclists, said: “With the Arctic and Amazon on fire and tens of thousands of Britons dying from car pollution, it beggars belief that chancellor Sajid Javid is proposing more toxic fossil fuel duty cuts. “The 2019 budget must be a climate and ecological emergency budget that includes £6bn per year for the creation of a national cycling network and the reversal of the toxic fuel duty cuts.” Many of the protesters had cycled into London from elsewhere in the UK. Extinction Rebellion called for “massive investment” in safe cycle lanes, which the group said would help protect children from fossil fuel pollution. Protesters’ other demands included a reversal of fuel tax cuts and the institution of car-free villages, towns and city centres. “If there were less cars and people cycled more, we would all be healthier,” Kelvin Dane, who cycled from Romford, Essex. “Its quite scary when you cycle in London – it’s not everybody’s cup of tea. There’s too many cars on the road, people are too lazy, they use cars for short distances. Its madness. People should just cycle, it’s very simple.”"
"Democrats will pit their climate plans against each other on Wednesday at a seven-hour CNN town hall, as world scientists warn the window is narrowing to prevent catastrophe. With the planet already about 1C (1.8F) warmer than before industrialization, the United Nations’ climate panel says that keeping the increase to 1.5C would require “rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society”. Carbon dioxide emissions in the US and abroad need to fall significantly in the next decade and reach “net zero” by 2050, according to the UN. Without massive changes, rising temperatures will worsen extreme weather, water and food instability, political unrest and poverty. Carbon free means eliminating all C02 emissions from power plants, cars, industry and agriculture. Carbon neutral or ""net-zero carbon"" would allow some emissions to continue as long as there are offsets, such as the planting of trees that absorb heat-trapping gases. Below we assess each candidate’s stance on the climate crisis and also the judgment of outside organizations. Three environmental groups are evaluating the candidates based on their plans and legislative records. Greenpeace assigns a letter grade for ending fossil fuel use and supporting a Green New Deal. Data for Progress tallies which elements of a Green New Deal candidates back. And the League of Conservation Voters ranks former lawmakers based on how they have voted in Congress on environment-related laws. However, some candidates were still releasing plans shortly before the town hall, amid pressure from the Democratic base, as well as school strikers and other protesters. To match what science requires, the next president would need to cut heat-trapping pollution from transportation, electricity, agriculture and land use, battling with Republicans who broadly downplay the crisis and oppose restrictions for industry. Some climate advocates worry Biden would not do enough to eliminate fossil fuels from the US economy. He stumbled over a debate question about whether coal and gas would have a place in his administration, saying “we will work it out” and promising to eliminate subsidies. But his rankings are decent and he has committed to the timeline outlined by the UN climate panel. Warren would spend $3tn over a decade to decarbonize buildings, transportation and electricity, according to a plan released on Tuesday. Her blueprint praises the extensive climate proposals of the Washington governor, Jay Inslee, who dropped out of the race last month. She had previously made pitches for green manufacturing, better land use, a green military and more clean energy research. Transportation produced 29% of greenhouse gas emissions, followed by electricity at 28%, industry at 22%, commercial and residential at 12% and agriculture at 9%, according to Environmental Protection Agency data from 2017.  Invoking the Green New Deal, he has proposed alongside congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Sanders aims to eliminate all carbon emissions by 2050, not just reach “net-zero”. His goal would be harder because it wouldn’t count offsets to climate pollution, like forests that absorb the gas. He would also spend far more than his competitors. Sanders wouldn’t give new licenses to nuclear plants, which currently account for more than half of carbon-free energy in the US. And he is not a supporter of technologies to capture carbon emissions – which scientists say will be necessary for the challenge ahead. Among the candidates, he has the longest history of advocating for radical change to stop the climate crisis. Harris’ plan, released Wednesday, falls between Biden and Sanders in terms of aggressiveness and spending. She would also tax carbon pollution. Most of the energy the US uses comes from oil made into gasoline for vehicles. For electricity production, 35% is from natural gas, 27% is from coal, 19% is from nuclear and 17% is from renewable energy (hydropower, wind, biomass and solar), according to the Energy Information Administration.  Buttigieg’s plan doesn’t specify how much he would spend in total, but his campaign told Vox it could reach around $1.5tn to $2tn. He wants to create 3m clean energy jobs, and he backs a price on carbon with rebates to low- and middle-income Americans. Yang would also tax carbon pollution and use revenues to fund alternative research, upgrade energy systems and subsidize fuel costs for low-income Americans. He says people will have to move to higher ground as seas rise. O’Rourke stops short of calling for a carbon tax, saying he backs a “legally enforceable standard” that will “send a clear price signal” to curb carbon emissions. China produces the most heat-trapping pollution, followed by the US. But historically, the US has contributed more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than any other nation. The US also has high emissions per capita, compared to other developed countries. And Americans buy products made in China, therefore supporting China's carbon footprint.  Booker is largely focused on environmental justice, and calls for the White House to coordinate to protect communities from environmental threats, including lead pipes that have contaminated drinking water where he was mayor, in Newark. He would ban new fossil fuel leases on public lands and spend on massive reforestation and wetlands restoration. He supports a carbon tax with dividends returned to people. Castro wants the whole country – including local governments and private entities – to invest $10tn over a decade to create 10m jobs and transition away from fossil fuels. He wants to cut emissions in half by 2030 and neutralize them by 2045. Klobuchar says she would “take aggressive executive action to confront the climate crisis” and introduce “sweeping climate legislation in the first 100 days of her presidency”. While she sets a goal for the US to be carbon-neutral by 2050, she has said she would not ban fracking for oil and gas and she supports “cleaner coal” technologies, according to Inside Climate News. She has also said she supports a Green New Deal but thinks it is aspirational. "

Solar industry lobby wants to punish climate emergency critics for sabotaging emergency measures
By Kalte Sonne
(Translated/edited by P. Gosselin) 
German public broadcaster Deutschlandfunk on December 25, 2019:
Climate scientist Johan Rockström thinks the declaration of a climate emergency is justified.
Rockström (Potsdam Institute Director):
The declaration of a “climate emergency” would make it possible to make really big decisions. …such as making things possible that are necessary but have not been considered realistic.“
This reminds in the diction of 24 March 1933, at that time the law was officially called: “Law to remedy the distress of the people and the Reich” and it served to abolish the Republic. Isn’t anyone suspicious?
What fits well here is an action of the solar industry lobby, which has made good business from the alleged climate catastrophe. Whoever criticizes the climate alarmism professionally is considered a troublemaker. So it fits in well with the picture that the Solarenergie Förderverein Deutschland e.V. (Solar Energy Association of Germany) is calling for the punishment of critics on its website. The address of the site is: http://sfv.de/artikel/verharmlosung_der_klimakrise_eine_straftat.htm. Here we read:
Wolf von Fabeck calls for punishment for those who trivialize the climate catastrophe:
Trivializing the climate catastrophe endangers the survival of mankind – do we have to accept this?

Why the trivializers cannot hide behind the fundamental right of freedom of expression
They even link to a PIK-alarm paper:
At the suggestion of the Fridays For Future demonstrators, Constance is now the first German city to declare a ‘climate emergency’ – a rather symbolic act – but one that shows what is needed. Mayor Burchardt explained that from now on all decisions to be taken by the city council must be assessed in terms of climate protection. At the same time, he called on the Federal Government to improve the legal framework for climate protection measures.
It is essential to ward off the danger decisively and to the best of our knowledge and belief, not only in Constance, but everywhere in Germany (everyone should first of all put their own house in order), and finally worldwide. In the case of climate catastrophe, the best knowledge is provided by the natural sciences, and not by those who trivialize it. What the trivializers do can be described as sabotage, and sabotage of emergency measures should be punished.”
[…]
A strong democracy must not accept this development. What is missing here is the legal threat of punishment within the Criminal Code – as already mentioned in the summary:
‘Anyone who plays down or denies the climate catastrophe in a way that is likely to disrupt, disparage or completely prevent the defense of the climate catastrophe under the Paris Climate Convention and its follow-up agreements will be punished with a fine of up to 300 days wages. In case of recurrence, the penalty is imprisonment.’
Such a threat of punishment in no way undermines the fundamental right to freedom of opinion. Also the freedom of opinion has, as already mentioned in the introduction, legal limits (Article 5, Paragraph 2, first half sentence German Law). For example, according to Paragraphs 185 to 187 of the German Criminal Code, insult, libel and slander are also sanctioned, because otherwise peaceful coexistence is not possible.”
Emergency laws, sabotage, punishment. This seemingly undemocratic argumentation is not entirely new in Germany. The last time it was heard was 80 years ago.
Note: The German Solar Energy Lobby also remarks:
Note: It is not the misled ones who should be punished, but the disinformers, the instigators, the authors and distributors of the fake news.”

We know people die prematurely of air pollution and it is a major issue, especially in developing countries. But it is essential to understand the difference between air pollution and CO2 emissions.
CO2 is essential to all forms of life and it is difficult for many people to believe the gloomy versions of the AGW theory. So climate alarmists often criticize Japan for using coal-fired thermal power, insisting it is very dirty.  But in fact Japan’s coal-fired smoke emissions are not dirty because they have been properly cleaned using technology.
Japanese climate alarmists don’t like to mention that SOx and NOx emissions from coal-burning plants in Japan are quite low. In Japan, coal power is good and if the world used the same technology, the air pollution problem would be solved in many countries.
Reality to Greta! Do you read?
What follows are charts showing how much sulfur oxide and nitrogen oxide emissions have improved over the recent decades. First we look at nitrogen oxides, NOx:

Data source: OECD
You’ll note that a number of countries have greatly reduced nitrogen oxide emissions in terms of unit GDP.

Even Greta Thunberg’s home country of Sweden has substantially reduced air pollution. Thanks to the earlier efforts of the now older generation, the developed world is far cleaner today, and thus supports the notion that more wealth leads to much cleaner environments. Those who realize this appreciate it and thank you!
Next we present a chart depicting sulfur oxide emissions. The results are very similar:

Data source: OECD
Above we see how industry was much dirtier 30 years ago and how it’s much cleaner today. But does the generation who worked hard to produce this excellent result get a thank you from the younger inheriting generation? Unfortunately not.
Instead the older generation only hear insults from the usual ignorant and petulant ingrates.
Finally we see a comparison chart of the OECD countries for the year 2017:
Data source: OECD
Europeans promoting wood burning!
So what does the younger generation demand we do? For starters they want to stop heating of homes using natural gas. Instead they are pushing for a return of the stinky wood-burning stoves – which they claim are better for the environment!

Share this...FacebookTwitterEarth’s atmosphere contains 400 ppm CO2 (0.04%). Mars has a 950,000 ppm (95%) CO2 atmosphere. But Mars has surface temperatures that are about -75°C colder on average than Earth’s because atmospheric density, or pressure, is the “game changer” largely determining planetary temperatures.

Image Source: Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum
Surface temperatures on Mars
The average surface temperature of a planetary body is significantly determined by its distance from the Sun.
According to the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Mars is close enough to the Sun to have its surface temperatures reach 35°C (95°F) at the equator during summer.
During winter, however, the Martian temperature dips to -90°C (-130°F).
The average surface temperature for Mars is about -60°C (-80°F).

Image Source: NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory
Atmospheric composition of Mars vs. Earth
Both Venus and Mars have atmospheres that contain over 95% CO2.
In contrast, Earth’s atmosphere contains just over 0.04% CO2.

Image Source: Space.com
Extreme temperature swings on Mars
While the solar heat reaching Mars can warm its surface by up to 35°C, about 8-11°C (15-20°F) of that incident heat will be lost to space just 1.5 meters from the surface (Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, 2018).
“There might be a 15-20 degree temperature change between where your feet are and where your head is if you were standing on Mars.”
Nights and winters are unfathomably cold, whereas daytime summer temperatures can be similar to or warmer than Earth’s.
As atmospheric scientist Dr. Matthew Shindell points out, the reason for this wide variance in temperature extremes is that “there is little to retain heat on the planet” despite Mars’ 950,000 ppm CO2 atmosphere.

Atmospheric density, or pressure, is the “big game changer”
Mars’ thin atmospheric denisity, or pressure (AP), reaches just 0.006 bar. Earth’s AP is 1 bar. The AP for Venus is 92 bar.

Image Source: ScienceDaily, 2017
Consequently, the Mars, Earth, and Venus surface temperatures average -60°C, 15°C, and 462°C, respectively.
Interestingly, on the summit of Venus’s Maxwell Montes the AP drops from 92 bar to 45 bar. In turn, the surface temperature plummets by -82°C even though the CO2 concentration (96%) is the same at both locations.

Image Source: Universe Today
Mars’ 0.006 bar AP is referred to as the “big game changer” in explaining why its surface is so cold on average. The atmospheric greenhouse gas composition – effectively the same (95-96% CO2) for both Mars and Venus – does “little to retain heat”.
In sum,  a planet’s relative warmth can be enhanced “due to an increase in atmospheric mass” or in its capacity to retain heat (Chemke et al., 2016), and temperatures are cooler if there is “a decline in atmosheric pressure” (Sorokhtin et al., 2007).

Image Source: Chemke et al., 2016

Image Source: Sorokhtin et al., 2007
Does the anthropogenic global warming (AGW) hypothesis have a Mars problem?
Again, despite Mars’ very high CO2 concentration, “there is little to retain heat on the planet”.
This conclusion would appear to undermine the AGW claim CO2 levels are a planet’s temperature control knob.
So the summarizing question is this. Why is Earth’s CO2 concentration of 0.03% to 0.04% considered both determinative and dangerous as a climate control mechanism if (a) relative planetary warmth is largely dependent on atmospheric density and (b) even a 95% CO2 concentration on Mars effectively doesn’t retain planetary heat?

Share this...FacebookTwitterA new 1876-present temperature reconstruction for Northern Finland shows the 1930s were the warmest period of the last 140 years. And there has been no net warming since.
Tree density analysis, MXD, has a “more prominent association with temperature” than measuring tree ring widths because it can more clearly separate precipitation factors affecting tree growth from temperature-limiting factors (Bjorklund et al., 2020).
Northern Finland is characterized as “the most suitable place in the world for temperature reconstruction” because it sits on the edge of where trees can or cannot grow (or survive) due to clearly defined temperature limits on growth. (For example, forests used to extend to the coast of the Arctic Ocean during the Early Holocene, indicating the Arctic region needed to have been 2.5 to 7°C warmer to accommodate such tree growth.)
Pinus sylvestris (29 trees) from northeastern Finland indicate the warmest interval since 1876 occurred in the 1930s, and since then there has been no net warming. This is visible in both tree ring width (RW) and density (MXD) analysis.

Image Source: Bjorklund et al., 2020
Other new “dendroclimatic” studies also show a similar temperature pattern of a warm early/mid-twentieth century and a subsequent cooling in the 1960s and 1970s prior to another warming in the 1990s-2000s. For example, in China, tree ring evidence suggest such a pattern for soil temperatures (Yuan et al., 2020), and Keyimu et al. (2020) find “A.D. 1940–1965 witnessed the longest extended warm period at Big Snow Mountain Scenic Area over the past 180 years”.

Proxy evidence from across the Northern Hemisphere may also show this same warming-cooling-warming temperature pattern. They also show the modern period is not climatically unusual relative to past ~1,500 years (Stoffel et al., 2015, Schneider et al., 2015).

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn yet another new paper (Drotos et al., 2020), scientists determine the climate sensitivity to CO2 is “practically zero” the more the concentration rises. A ~4450 ppm CO2 concentration has cooler climates than observed in the pre-industrial (278 ppm) era. Why? A self-amplifying cloud feedback mechanism cools the Earth by magnitudes “as large as 10 K” upon warming saturation.
Earlier this year, scientists published a paper using mesocosms (controlled outdoor experiments) to demonstrate CO2 concentrations of 3200, 7500, and 16,900 ppm are associated with colder temperatures than in outdoor environments with 480 ppm CO2 concentrations.
Now, in another new paper (Drotos et al., 2020), several more scientists are asserting the Earth system has an internal, self-amplifying negative cloud feedback mechanism so powerful that
“at CO2 concentrations beyond four times the preindustrial value, the climate sensitivity decreases to nearly zero as a result of episodic global cooling events as large as 10 K”.
The cooling events spawned by the high CO2 concentrations lead to temperature “drops below the coldest values of the control [278 ppm pre-industrial CO2]” such that the climate sensitivity to CO2 doublings is “practically zero” over time.
“In particular, the climatological mean value of the global mean surface temperature practically stops responding to an increase in the CO2 concentration. This practically zero climate sensitivity suggests that the effect of a feedback on the global mean surface temperature may turn out to be as strong as the radiative effect of CO2.”
In other words, scientists have found yet another way the claimed “runaway greenhouse” response of the climate system to elevated CO2 turns out to be a false alarm.

"These days as a climate scientist, the line of separation between the research I do in my professional life and the events unfolding in the world at large is growing ever thinner. The extreme events that our community has been talking about for decades are now becoming part of our lived experience, season after season, year after year across the entire planet. What we are seeing play out now is much faster than many of us ever imagined. Barely a week after sweltering through an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) lead author meeting discussing the UN group’s sixth global climate assessment report during an unseasonable European heatwave, it’s been surreal to return home to find much of Australia’s eastern seaboard engulfed in unprecedented bushfires crisis. In spring. Right now there are about 80 fires in Queensland and a further 60 blazes raging through New South Wales. The maps show the east coast terrifyingly lit up like a grotesque Christmas tree. Many of these fires are burning out of control as the relentlessly gusty winds ground the firefighting aircraft needed to bring the blazes under control. It is shocking to see such extreme and widespread fire weather conditions so early in the spring. In fact, this year the bushfire season actually started in winter, two months earlier than normal. Most alarmingly, some of these fires are occurring in subtropical and coastal areas that don’t usually burn. Perhaps it shouldn’t come as a surprise, given about 98% of NSW and 65% of Queensland is currently drought affected. Many regional towns like Stanthorpe are coming close to running out of water, having to resort to trucking in supplies to avoid water shortages. And now, even more water is needed to fight the blazes bearing down on regions already struggling with severe drought conditions. Australia’s second-warmest January to August on record has baked the landscape dry, turning usually wet rainforests into fuel under catastrophic bushfires conditions. All of this comes off the back of summer of 2018-2019, which was Australia’s warmest on record. Extraordinarily, we broke the previous 2012-2013 record by a margin of almost 1C, with 206 new records set across the country in 2018-2019. The heat was particularly extreme in NSW, where monthly mean temperatures in January were 5.86°C above average, making it the state’s hottest January on record by more than 2°C. Just to be crystal clear: these record-breaking conditions are all signals of the warming trend we have been experiencing in Australia since the start of the Bureau of Meteorology’s records in 1910. Nine of Australia’s 10 warmest years on record have occurred since 2005, and that long-term trend shows no sign of turning around any time soon. As a scientist, what I find particularly disturbing about the current conditions is that world heritage rainforest areas such as the Lamington national park in the Gold Coast hinterland are now burning. This region of eastern Australia is part of the Gondwana rainforests of Australia, which contains the largest remaining stands of subtropical rainforest in the world, and the most significant areas of warm temperate rainforest in the country. These usually moss-drenched forests are packed with the oldest elements of the world’s ferns, and primitive plant families dating back to the Jurassic era, some 200m to 145m years ago. Although these remarkable rainforests have clung on since the age of the dinosaurs, searing heat and lower rainfall is starting to see these wet areas dry out for longer periods of the year, increasing bushfire risk in these precious ecosystems. It has been hard to watch the news coverage of these exceptionally rare rainforests burning. Just like the dying off of 50% of the Great Barrier Reef, the potential loss of these areas is something I never thought I would witness in my lifetime. The world has justifiably been grieving the recent accelerated destruction of the Amazon, but fewer Australians appreciate our own ecological disaster unfolding on our doorstep. The Gondwana rainforests of Australia are evolutionary relics that have immeasurable conservation value to the global community. If rapid climate change destabilises the cool and wet conditions needed for these ancient rainforests to survive, they may be lost to humanity forever. Although there are natural seasonal fluctuations in the Indian and Southern Ocean that are influencing the dry and windy conditions we are currently experiencing, all of Australia’s weather and climate variability is now occurring in a world that is 1°C warmer than it was since pre-industrial times. The human fingerprint on Australian temperatures has been clearly detected since 1950. This means that all natural variability is now being modified by human influences on the climate system, leading to changes in observed climate variability and extremes. Since the 1970s, there has been an increase in extreme fire weather, and a longer fire season, across large parts of the country. Under the world’s business-as-usual emissions scenario we are currently on, Australia’s average temperature will typically increase 4°C by the end of the century. To be blunt, the catastrophic fire weather conditions we are experiencing now will become increasingly common as the planet continues to warm. It’s clear to me that the extreme events we are experiencing right now in Australia and all over the world, are a sign of things to come. Events that were considered extreme in today’s climate will become average in the future as records continue to be broken and the “new normal” emerges. What we expect to see in our future climate is playing out right now, not decades in the future. As we begin to drift away from the safe shores of historical variability, the only certainty is that life in the “new normal” will be outside the range of human experience. All of this begs the obvious question: what will it take for Australians to wake up to the climate crisis we now face? The harsh reality is that this event is likely to be forgotten once the fires are finally out and the media interest has moved on. Despite being one of the worst bushfires in Australian history, alarmingly, the Victorian Black Saturday bushfires of 2009, which killed 173 people, destroyed around 2,000 homes and incinerated millions of plants and animals, didn’t serve as a wake-up call. The deeper we sink into denial, the more we commit ourselves to a reality where our children learn about environmental icons such as the Great Barrier Reef and our magnificent rainforests through history books, instead of being able to experience their wonder for themselves. Choosing to turn away from this moment to act will be the ultimate betrayal of future generations. Dr Joëlle Gergis is an award-winning climate scientist and writer based at the Australian National University. She is a lead author of the United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment report, and an expert advisor to the Climate Council.

Share this...FacebookTwitterToday I found an interview with an “environmental expert” by the German alarmist site Klimareporter here. It conveys to us the real aims of the radical climate movement. In a nutshell: To change, limit and dominantly control human behavior.
In the Kilmareporter interview, Prof. Rainer Griesshammer says that changing light bulbs, riding your bicycle and eating organic aren’t going to cut it when it comes to rescuing the climate.
In the interview, Klimareporter brings up Mr. Griesshammer’s  recent book in which he calls for “changing politics and life” in order to combat climate change.
Politics, Griesshammer says, will “not be enough on its own” and that “changes in several areas of society – in the value system, consumer behavior, the legal framework and the market, as well as in infrastructure and technology development” are required.
Citizens still in self-deception
In the interview Grießhammer says that citizens are in a state of “self deception” because “most people already think they are environmentalists because they separate the garbage, screw in a few energy-saving lamps or LEDs and occasionally shop at the organic food store”. But this is woefully insufficient. Most people fail when it comes to protecting the climate in terms of “mobility, electricity consumption, nutrition,” says Griesshammer.
Radical behavior change
What is needed, he says, is radical change in “behavior and shopping”. According to Griesshammer: “In the mainstream, there will only be significant changes if laws, CO2 pricing, product development, infrastructures and behavior all move in the same direction.”
According to Griesshammer, offsets are not going to work because people will continue to emit CO2. He says: “CO2 savings can only be achieved through measures in the home country – such as phasing out coal, renovating buildings, speed limits.”

Germany moving far too slowly
Griesshammer thinks the CO2 reduction target set by the federal government is “far too weak” and sees little hope that Germany will come anywhere near the stated targets because the just-decided coal phase-out “is falling further behind” and at the same time, onshore wind energy is being “stifled by the German government.”
Moreover, petrol and diesel becoming around 7.5 cents per litre more expensive next year means “motorists are unlikely to react to this”.
Policymakers must react “much faster”…”much more sharply”
Griesshammer is also in favor of stricter speed limits on the country’s roads and streets, saying the measure would not only save on emissions, but also lives.
When it comes to global warming, Griesshammer says  policymaking has waited far too long: “Now we have to react much faster and much more sharply. There is a threat of incalculable tipping points with irreversible acceleration of the climate catastrophe…”
Bicycle riding, burning wood and deindustrialization
He says that cutting CO2 has been more successful in other countries: “Denmark has less industry and many good wind locations. Finland can use a lot of wood for energy production and continues to rely on nuclear power.”
“In transport,” Griesshammer says, “it makes more sense to adopt something. The bicycle traffic in Copenhagen is a great example.”

Professor of Virology, Henrik Streeck. Institute for HIV Research, Germany,  CC BY 2.5
Investigation dropped
The online German General Anzeiger here reports that the Bonn state prosecutor’s office has decided not to pursue a criminal investigation of renowned researcher Hendrik Streeck, Professor of Virology, after the police had received a 100-page criminal complaint from an unnamed person who claimed to be a scientist.
No criminal science behavior found

“After examining a criminal complaint against the Bonn virologist Hendrik Streeck, the Bonn public prosecutor’s office has refused to start investigations,” reports the General Anzeiger, “No criminal behavior was found to justify investigations, a press spokesman said.”

The unnamed scientist who filed the criminal complaint accused Streeck of “having made up research results and made false statements in connection with the Heinsberg study.”

Also German business magazine “Capital” reported on its online site about alleged “contradictory data on which the ethics committee of the University of Bonn gave the green light for the study to be carried out.”
Streeck was also accused if “making up research results” and refusing “to provide raw data for verification”.
Study: COVID-19 death rate overstated by factor of 10
The distinguished virologist Streeck is the head of the Institute of Virology and HIV Research at the University Hospital of Bonn, and the lead author of the now famous “Heinsberg study” whose results showed that the mortality rate of COVID-19 was in fact significantly lower than that previously claimed by numerous health officials and the media.
According to the University of Bonn: “This number of unreported cases is about 10 times higher than the officially reported cases (162,496 on May 3rd, 2020).”
North Rhine Westphalia’s Minister President used the results of Streeck’s study to defend his decision to relax restrictions.
A number of officials and parties with an interest in spreading panic reacted angrily to the study’s panic-silencing affect. It’s still unknown who was behind the 100-page criminal complaint effort.
Virologists receiving death threats
Wolfgang Holzgreve, Director the University Clinic in Bonn, told the General-Anzeiger he was concerned about “the increasing number of accusations against scientists” and: “It’s amazing what people have to put up with these days. Some virologists have even received death threats. I think we’ll have to live with that.”

"The mountain peak known to Swedes as their country’s highest can no longer lay claim to the title due to global heating, scientists have confirmed, as the glacier at its summit shrinks amid soaring Arctic temperatures.  “This is quite a symbol,” said Gunhild Ninis Rosqvist, a Stockholm University geography professor who has been measuring the glacier annually for several years. “A very obvious, very clear signal to everyone in Sweden that things are changing.” In the far north of Sweden, about 95 miles (150km) inside the Arctic circle, Kebnekaise has two peaks: a southern, glacier-covered summit accessible to suitably equipped hikers, and a northern neighbour that is free of ice but reserved for experienced mountaineers. Since they were first measured in 1880, the southern peak has been the higher. But when Ninis Rosqvist and her team took this year’s measurements, at the end of the summer melt on 3 September, the northern peak was 1.2 metres higher at 2,096.8 metres. “We suspected this was probably the case last year,” Ninis Rosqvist told the Guardian from the Tarfala research station at the foot of the massif. “But unfortunately our measurements were not precise enough. Now we can say with certainty: we are accurate to within a couple of centimetres.” The scientist said the height of Kebnekaise’s southern peak was the lowest on record: 24 metres less than in the 1960s. “Almost all the shrinkage has been in past two decades, when the glacier has lost an average of one metre a year,” she said. Since the glacier was likely to expand again with winter snow and ice, the southern peak could briefly recover its ranking, Ninis Rosqvist said. “It will keep changing for a while,” she said. “But the trend is now firmly established, and very clear.” Sweden recorded its hottest ever months of May and July in 2018, with temperatures soaring to more than 10C above normal. With wildfires burning across the Arctic, the Kebnekaise glacier shrank by almost four metres. Although this July was not as hot after an unusually cool start to the month, the village of Markusvinsa in the far north of the country recorded 34.8C on 26 July – the highest temperature ever recorded north of the Arctic circle in Sweden. Ninis Rosqvist said small glaciers such as that on Kebnekaise’s southern peak were particularly badly affected by warm summers. It was mainly cool summers that allowed glaciers to grow, rather than particularly harsh winters, she said. But the past two Scandinavian summers had caused the snow and ice to melt away very fast. “You can see it at the top, where it’s most exposed to the sun. It really looks different. It gets slippery up there; you can see the meltwater running off.” The news may have been expected, but the official downgrading of the southern peak was still “emotionally quite something”, Ninis Rosqvist said. “The mountains are changing so fast – higher temperatures, less snow, winter rain.” The glacier on Kebnekaise’s southern peak was “iconic – a symbol for all the glaciers in Sweden”, she said, adding: “But you know, we don’t need any more symbols. We don’t need to pile up more evidence. We can see the climate changing before our eyes up here, and we need to do something about it.”"

By Die kalte Sonne
(Text translated by P Gosselin)
A documentary from 2015 “Burned“ (free of charge 30 min online version here) goes very well with the often mentioned documentary “Planet Of The Humans“.
Is wood the USA’s new coal?
You can almost get that impression after watching the two films. The United States has decided to consider wood burning  as green energy. You simply assume that trees have converted CO2 into biomass during their growth, so it is a zero-sum game when you burn them later.
This is a very interesting consideration because it ignores the slow growth of the trees. A tree that is burned in a short period of time can only be replaced by a new tree in a much longer period of time. So the calculation is unfortunately very much misleading, and not to mention other positive aspects of trees and forests, which also disappear with deforestation.
Burning wood is pretty much the dirtiest way to generate heat energy. The table below shows the difference compared to other fossil fuels.

Table above shows that wood as a fuel produces far great amounts of pollution.
And it doesn’t matter how big the efforts are to minimize the pollutants when burning wood, even the best values are far away from gas or even oil.
Burned shows in a frightening way how more and more wood chip factories have have set up in the USA. They are all located near coasts, mainly in the east of the country and therefore near ports. These ports are important because there are massive exports to Europe, among others.
After all, the EU has also decided to give the energy blessing to wood-burning. As a result, the forests in the eastern part of the United States have also been massively destroyed since 2000.

At the same time, highly subsidized wood-fired power plants are being built in the USA, where they are operated under the label of “biomass”.
Even former coal-fired power plants can be heated with wood without any problems. Burned shows examples from the UK, where it is done in exactly the same way.
Biomass and car tires

The film also reveals quite different, unpleasant truths. For example, the operators are allowed to burn old car tires or poison-soaked disused railway ties as well. Poisons that have been banned in the USA for some time.
Brazen investors
Looking at houses, cars and plants near such power plants, which are covered with a sticky layer of soot every day, one wonders not only what the environmental standards are like in the USA but also how brazen the investors of such plants are. After all, massive environmental destruction and pollution is being carried out under the label of climate protection.
Takes decades to regenerate a forest
Forests are excellent carbon sinks, but they are much more. In old, mainly natural forests there is a wide diversity of plants and animals. In newly planted plantations, as compensation for the deforested old forests, this diversity is not present. It takes a long time for such systems to form and function. All these thoughts do not seem to be taken into consideration in the USA.
The idea of burning wood instead of coal was also supported for a long time by the US counterpart to Fridays For Future (FFF): 350.org. Its founder and activist Bill McKibben also has his say in the film.
“It seems to me like climate change is a kind of final exam for our species. We’ll find out if the big brain was in fact a good idea or not. Maybe if it’s connected to a big enough heart to make a difference. We’ve been given ample warning by the world’s scientists. Now the question is whether we’ll heed it or not.”

Evolution has given man a large brain for thinking. Using it can never hurt, because then even an activist like McKibben would have to realize what a bad idea the US interpretation of “biomass” is.
Meanwhile, McKibben seems to have come to the realization that it’s not so good to follow the former philosophy “From brown to green” – after being confronted with a first version of “Planet Of The Humans”. But of course, the hundreds of wood power plants built at his behest are still running.
What role does Europe play?
The EU has given the green light to burning wood. It gets even better. Organizations like the German Environmental Aid (DUH) promote pellet stoves as clean heat The table above shows just how clean it really is. Yet, one can also get completely different view if one looks at the development of pollutants in times of corona and strongly decreased traffic.
Does the DUH create its own basis here to get communities in behind it because the values do not decrease even with strongly reduced traffic.
In any case, there seem to be very big differences between environmental activists in the US and those in Europe. While here in Germany, every tree in the Hambach Forest gets defended tooth and nail so that it does not have to give way to coal mining, environmentalists in the USA celebrate the destruction of the environment while the USA gives millions in subsidies for its success.
We’d like to see more of these films so that all facets of the energy revolution are really shown.

Share this...FacebookTwitterPress release by the WERTEUNION IN BAVARIA: “The Sun Drives Climate, Not Co2”.  The Werte Union  (Values Union) in Bavaria decisively rejects “The Green Deal“ and C02-pricing.
Hat-tip: EIKE



Sun drives climate
Munich, December 30, 2019 – The grassroots initiative WerteUnion in Bavaria – Conservative Start – considers it proven that the sun controls the climate, and not carbon dioxide (C02). The new climate laws are therefore insignificant for the climate, yet “threaten the foundations of freedom, prosperity and market economy”, the state level executive said.
In particular, the conservative grassroots movement within the CSU (Christian Socialist Union) criticizes the “Green Deal” presented by EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and the C02 price set by the German government’s climate package, which has now been toughened by raising the C02 price to more than 25 euros per tonne.
Deindustrialization: industries will simply move
The WerteUnion in Bavaria sees this as the first step towards the deindustrialization of Germany. Dr. Thomas Jahn, deputy chairman of the WerteUnion, explained: “The closure of our plants will indeed lead to a reduction in C02 emissions in Germany, but this would not have any positive effect on the environment. The deindustrialization of Germany is rather shifting production to countries with low environmental standards, above all the People’s Republic of China. The WerteUnion in Bavaria sees this as a threat to the fundamental values of the free world, especially the market economy.”

Chemist Dr. Christian Steidl, member of the Federal Executive Board of the WerteUnion e.V. and of the State Executive Board of the WerteUnion in Bavaria, criticized the C02-pricing for the following reasons: “The energy price increase acts as an industrial migration acceleration law. Even if the measure were to result not only in a relocation of industry, but also in C02 savings, this would be insignificant for our climate, because this is controlled by the sun. Over the last 600 million years, C02 has demonstrably not controlled the climate and there is no scientific evidence as to why it should be any different at the moment.”

Education campaign on the topic: “Climate, solar cycles and carbon dioxide”
The Werte Union in Bavaria therefore has announced an educational offensive under the leadership of Bohdan Kalwarowskyj, Dr. Christian Steidl and Dr. Ellen Walther-Klaus about the scientific fundamentals of climate change, as these are neglected especially in schools.
The fact that ice ages were not triggered by a reduction of the C02 content in the atmosphere was already proven in 1913 by the Marburg mineralogy professor Emanuel Kayser (Zentralblatt für Mineralogie etc., 1913, p. 769.). This long disproved CO2- greenhouse gas theory was revived in the 1980s for political reasons and supported by targeted allocation of research funds.
Growing dissent
On the basis of quantum physical, atmospheric and astronomical studies, however, more and more scientists contradict the thesis of a climate change “man-made” by CO2 emissions:

rer.nat. Siegfried Dittrich, one of the most knowledgeable on the effects of C02, has presented this in an article in the scientific journal FUSION Vol. 39. 2018. No. 2 pages 6ff in an easily comprehensible manner.
The refutation by English climate scientists of the C02 theory was discussed by Martin Durkin in 2007 in the film “The Great Global Warming Swindle“ 
The strong correlation of the climate over the last 100 years with the intensity of sunspots is proven in detail. Prof. Dr. Henrik Svensmark studies the influence of solar cycles on climate and cosmic rays on cloud formation. The WELT already reported on this in 2009 under the heading “Ein Physiker erschüttert die Klimatheorie” (A phsicist shakes up the climate theory).
Very informative is also a video of the conversation between Dipl. Ing. Michael Limburg from the EIKE Institute for Climate & Energy with Karl-Herrmann Steinberg. the last Minster for Environment of the GDR.

Climate researcher Rex Fleming recently summarized in his published book: ,,[D]ie vorherrschende Definition des Klimawandels – wie sie von den Vereinten Nationen vertreten und durch einen C02-Ausstoß verursacht verstanden wird – ist ein Mythos“ (T]he prevailing definition of climate change – as advocated by the United Nations and understood to be caused by C02 emissions – is a myth) – Rex J. Fleming: The Rise and Fall of the Carbon Dioxide Theory of Climate Change, Springer Nature Switzerland, Cham (CH), 2019.
Call to reopen the debate
On this scientific basis, the WerteUnion Bayern – Konservativer Aufbruch has adopted a climate manifesto calling for a withdrawal of the C02 pricing plans and an open debate on the real causes of climate fluctuations. The document is available on the website of the WerteUnion in Bayern (https://konservativeraufbruch.de/).

Share this...FacebookTwitterCORRECTION: The ARD has not changed its color scheme. The chart for 2009 shows the 3-day forecast, which according to ARD in fact has not changed.  The 2019 is the forecast chart for the day, and this 1-day chart uses a different color code for temperature. It too has not changed since 2009. The third chart, as already mentioned, is from another source: website: wetter.de. Hat-tip: reader Taylor Martin
=======================================
German public television is splashing red on its weather forecast charts to make people think it’s hot. 
At Facebook, Akinom Dnagiew posted two fascinating side-by-side weather charts used by German ARD public television for weather forecasting:

“Do you feel manipulated.” Image: ARD
Readers will notice how in 2009 a calm, neutral chart was used for showing the day’s high temperatures, in Celsius. But then 10 years later, in 2019, the ARD was using more dramatic and aggressive color scheme to represent temperatures. Now it seems to be hot even when it’s relatively cool!
In 2009, in northeast Germany, 27°C is shown without red hot colors. Then in 2019, even a relatively cool 22°C (72°F) gets shown as red hot.
The German title of the above chart reads: “Fühlen Sie sich manipuliert?” (“Do you feel manipulated?”
Looking at the chart from 2009, one sees the temperatures figures are high, yet we don’t get a hot visual impression. In 2019, on the other hand, a viewer way up in northern Germany might even start sweating a little bit from all the hot looking red, even though the high is expected to be only 20°C (68°F).

Share this...FacebookTwitterAn “especially worrying” new study finds 2,206 onshore wind, hydropower, and solar PV energy generation facilities have “already encroached on many of the world’s most important places for conserving biodiversity”, degrading 886 protected areas, 749 key biodiversity areas, and 40 distinct wilderness areas.

Image Source: Rehbein et al., 2020
Even more concerning, the number of active renewable energy facilities inside important conservation areas is poised to increase by ~42% by 2028.
To avert climate climate change, the United Nations demands a 10-fold increase in renewable energy by 2060. This emphasis will especially occur in developing regions like Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, where the most biodiverse regions in the world are the most threatened.
Rehbein et al., 2020
“[R]enewable energy facilities can be landuse intensive and impact conservation areas, and little attention has been given to whether the aggregated effect of energy transitions poses a substantial threat to global biodiversity. Here, we assess the extent of current and likely future renewable energy infrastructure associated with onshore wind, hydropower and solar photovoltaic generation, within three important conservation areas: protected areas (PAs), Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) and Earth’s remaining wilderness. We identified 2,206 fully operational renewable energy facilities within the boundaries of these conservation areas, with another 922 facilities under development. Combined, these facilities span and are degrading 886 PAs, 749 KBAs and 40 distinct wilderness areas.”
“Our results show that renewable energy development has already encroached on many of the world’s most important places for conserving biodiversity, with 2,206 facilities already operational within PAs [protected areas], KBAs [key biodiversity areas] and wilderness areas (Figure S2). Furthermore, the number of active renewable energy facilities inside important conservation areas could increase by ~42% by 2028, suggesting conflicts will likely intensify in the near future.”
“This is especially worrying, when assessments show the growth required to achieve the UN climate targets by 2060 (Bauer et al., 2017; IEA, 2017b) would be an order of magnitude greater than the installed capacity included in our ‘operational’ and ‘under development’ datasets.”
“Our results also show that the spatial distribution of overlaps is moving from developed regions towards more biodiverse developing regions such as Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, where the consequences for global biodiversity conservation will be more intense.”

"The ocean off the western coast of North America is five degrees Fahrenheit hotter than usual after warming at an unusually rapid rate, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa). It has been dubbed the “north-east Pacific marine heatwave of 2019”.  Marine heatwaves are defined as oceanic events in which the surface temperature of the water is warmer than 90% of past measurements for at least five days in a row. The current heatwave is the second-largest since scientists started tracking the phenomenon in 1981, Noaa reported on Friday. If the abnormal patch does not dissipate soon, it could become as destructive as the so-called “blob” of warm water in the same area that, in 2014-2016, created toxic algae blooms, killed sea lions and endangered whales by forcing them to forage closer to shore. Oceanographers started to notice something strange back in June in a triangle-shaped mass of ocean stretching from Alaska to Hawaii to southern California. The direct cause of the heat is weak winds, though these conditions do not usually persist for months at a time as they have done this year. Warm water has also lingered from the previous extreme heat event. “It went from a little bit warmer than average to about as warm as we’ve ever seen it, in just three months,” said Nate Mantua, a research scientist at Noaa’s Southwest Fisheries Science Center in Santa Cruz, California. “It’s not clear to me that there’s a simple link between persistence of this weather pattern and longer-term climate change,” Mantua added. “There might be. It’s still an evolving field and there are a lot of open questions.” The oceans have absorbed about 90% of excess heat linked to the climate crisis. “That’s played out over many decades now, and it’s a slow process compared with this event, which has happened in just three months,” Mantua said. It is also not known if there have been major impacts on marine life, mostly because researchers have relatively little monitoring equipment in the 4m square miles of ocean affected. Oceanographers are starting to see subtle effects in the distribution of some species, Mantua said, such as tuna that are hanging out closer to the coast to avoid the warmer waters. The impact has mostly been limited to the upper 50 meters of the ocean. “If it persists for one to two years, then warming will penetrate to deeper depths,” Mantua said."
"Out in the Macquarie Marshes, about 1ookm north of Warren in the central west of New South Wales, large inland wetlands have become a place for the dead and dying. “We went out last night and there was a little patch of water with dead and dying European carp,” Richard Kingsford, the director of the Centre for Ecosystem Science at the University of NSW, says. “There’s dead and dying things everywhere. Kangaroos dying and even foxes are dying.  “We were trying to trap for turtles but there doesn’t seem to be enough water for turtles. I’m not sure where they’ve gone to.” There are large parts of the Macquarie River that have dried up completely as the state remains in the grip of one of the most severe droughts on record. Valley water storages in the Macquarie are sitting at 11%. In the Namoi, in north-west NSW where water shortages have been acute, they’re at 1.5%. The Border Rivers, in the region between the NSW and Queensland border, are at 6%. In Sydney, dam storages have dropped below 50% for the first time in more than a decade. It’s one part of the climate crisis playing out across much of the country. A different year, similar story. Most places are drier than usual, warmer than usual. The summer of 2018 brought record-breaking heat for Australia. It’s too early to say whether this summer will bring such extremes. But early outlooks for spring and December are again pointing to above average temperatures. And with the exception of parts of Western Australia and the west of Tasmania, the outlook is for below average rainfall. “For most of Australia it’s this consistent dry story for the remainder of the year,” Jonathan Pollock, a climatologist at the Bureau of Meteorology, says. “It’s very likely it’s going to be hotter than usual and it’s very likely it’s going to be drier than usual.” For the first eight months of the year, the country’s mean temperature was the second warmest on record. Mean maximums were the warmest on record over the same period and mean minimums the equal-sixth warmest. Rainfall through winter was below to very much below average for most of the country, including New South Wales, southern and western Queensland, parts of northern and eastern Victoria, the east coast of Tasmania, the majority of South Australia and the Northern Territory, and most of the eastern half of Western Australia, and some coastal areas in the west of that state. In drought-hit parts of eastern and southern Australia, rainfall levels for the season were in the lowest 10% of historical records. Pollock says it would take something like a La Niña, which is associated with heavier rainfall, “to bring the turnaround that we need”. The El Niño-Southern Oscillation is currently neutral and is expected to remain so until the end of 2019 and into early 2020. The prolonged dry and warm conditions have meant authorities have already issued warnings for the spring and into summer. Fire services have told communities to be ready for a challenging bushfire season and to prepare their homes, properties and evacuation plans early. The Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre published its seasonal outlook last week, which warned parts of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, and parts of Western Australia and South Australia, face an above normal potential fire threat. On Friday, just a week into September, authorities issued total fire bans in Queensland and parts of New South Wales, with extreme, and potentially catastrophic, conditions expected in some areas. Richard Thornton, the chief executive of the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre, said winter had brought some significant fires to the north of the country and recent weeks had seen a spate of fires in south-east Queensland and NSW. He said the ongoing drought was driving much of the risk this season and there was concern for forested areas that were already dry heading into the warmer months. Thornton said that included a swathe beginning south of Rockhampton in Queensland and running all the way down the east coast into NSW and east Gippsland in Victoria. “That takes in the major populated areas in south-east Queensland and around Sydney and the ACT – so some pretty significant population centres,” he said. He said the conditions in eastern Tasmania, South Australia’s Eyre Peninsula and Kangaroo Island, south-western WA and parts of the Nullarbor, where rainfall has regenerated grasslands, also looked challenging. In a couple of months, authorities will revisit the outlook to see if anything has changed heading into January and February 2020. Along river systems in New South Wales, the outlook is similarly grim. In the summer of 2018, low river flows caused by a combination of drought and over-extraction of water, coupled with extreme temperatures, caused an environmental catastrophe that killed thousands of fish. Fisheries managers say they anticipate more fish are likely to perish this season if the drought continues. A spokeswoman for the NSW Department of Primary Industries said it was “an evolving situation” and aquatic habitats were being closely monitored. “Significant concerns are held for the Lower Darling, Namoi, Macquarie and Lachlan catchments in the early part of the summer as well as the Barwon-Darling, Border Rivers and Gwydir should current conditions persist,” she said. Up in Queensland, Angus Emmott, an ecologist and farmer, runs a cattle station about 130km south-east of Longreach. The property primarily receives its rain in summer but, until last year, it had what he calls “eight failed summer rains in a row”. That broke last summer, as a result of “two big floods”. “We’re having a really good season unlike much of the country to the east of us,” Emmott says. “Up above us, near Julia Creek, they’ve had so much rain it killed three-quarters of a million head of cattle and washed all the fences and pastures away when Townsville got flooded as well”. Emmott says for his farm it was a case of “luck”. The rains that had helped his property last year had caused catastrophe further north. And outside of the floodplains, places were still in drought. “One thing that’s really affected agriculture in this part of the country is climate change,” he says. “That brings hotter than normal temperatures, drier than usual weather and higher minimums. “Then what is happening is when we get a rainfall event there’s more of a chance of them being massive, like the one at Julia Creek, which created havoc.” Emmott is on the board of the advocacy group Farmers for Climate Action. In a bit more than a week, he says farmers will be travelling to Canberra to call for a national strategy on climate and agriculture. “I think things can change and they actually are but they would change so much quicker if we had a government that took some leadership,” he says. “If we didn’t have to drag them kicking and screaming, we’d get places a lot quicker. This applies to both sides of politics. They talk the talk and then do nothing.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterLeading dailies in Germany are reporting today that power companies across the country will be hiking electricity prices once again in the February to April period, affecting millions of households.
This comes at the heels of a January price hike.
“The wave of electricity price increases in Germany is not abating. According to figures from the comparison and brokerage portal Verivox, 86 utilities have announced average price increases of 8.1 percent for the months February to April,” writes Germany’s flagship Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) here. “For a family with an annual consumption of 4000 kilowatt hours, this would mean additional costs of around 100 euros per year.”
Already in January, “543 basic utilities had already increased their electricity prices”, according to the FAZ. “The average increase was 5.4 percent.”
The price hikes come just as Germany’s electricity rates have become among the world’s highest. Annually tens of thousands of German households see their power cut off because they are unable to pay their bills.
A large portion of the rate hike is due to the feed-in tariffs for green energies such as wind and sun.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA number of countries have even made wood-burning a part of their drive to cut down on CO2 emissions. For example cities like Munich, Germany are seeing a rise in wood burning as a source of heat.
Moreover, many German cities are moving to ban diesel engine cars because of the CO2 they produce and, more importantly, all the terrible fine particles they emit.
German cities choking on “green” wood smoke
Yet, ironically, as cities move to “clean” up their act and protect the climate, the opposite is in fact becoming the result. German cities are increasingly choking on fine particles emitted by dirty wood-burning – and activists are turning a blind eye to the growing problem.
In the case of Munich, Swiss meteorologist Jörg Kachelmann recently pointed out that evening time air quality in the Bavarian capital becomes worse than the average air quality of much of New South Wales, Australia even as bush fires rage.
Kachelmann tweeted:
All air measurement stations in the fire-affected New South Wales currently have better air quality than the wood-fired Munich.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt the end of the last glacial, when CO2 concentrations hovered around 250 ppm, there were abrupt warming and cooling events in the Spanish mountains (Béjar range) with magnitudes of 3°C within decades. Peak temperatures were at times warmer than today.
It has often been claimed that abrupt warming and cooling events with amplitudes reaching multiple degrees within 20 to 50 years were confined to records obtained from polar climates.
Greenland
Greenland, for example, warmed by 8 to 16°C “within decades or less” 20 or more times during the last 80,000 years (Li et al., 2019). The warming and cooling events may have occurred in the absence of an external an forcing mechanism; instead, they were an “unforced oscillation”. The abrupt climate changes extended throughout the Northern Hemisphere and even into the Southern Hemisphere.

Image Source: Li et al., 2019
New England (US)
In the northeastern United States, temperatures plummeted by 5.6°C within 200 years about 13,000 years ago (Hou et al., 2007). Then, around 11,600 years ago, temperatures abruptly rose ~5.4°C “in less than 200 years”. One proxy location (Blood Pond) even suggests there was an 8°C warming event in the US about 11,500 years ago.

Western Spain (Béjar)
A new study (Lopez-Saez et al., 2020) of the Late-Glacial-Early-Holocene period (about 15,000 to 11,500 years ago) analyzes evidence of tree cover transitions in the western Iberian region (Spain).
Deciduous oak forests were assessed to have abruptly expanded and declined during this period. The established temperature tolerances for this tree species suggest the warming-cooling transitions occurred within decades to centuries, and the climate change amplitudes could reach 2-4°C.
Despite the low and modestly fluctuating CO2 concentrations during this Late-Glacial period (~250 ppm), the evidence suggests regional temperatures were warmer than today 13.9, 12.3, 11.5-11.3, and 10.9 ka cal BP (thousand calibrated years before present).
These pronounced natural climate change events in the paleoclimate record do not support the contention that modern temperture changes are unusual or unprecedented.

Share this...FacebookTwitterReforestation removes CO2 from the atmosphere. Reforestation substantially cools the Earth’s land surfaces. Therefore, reforestation offers a “meaningful opportunity for local climate mitigation and adaptation”. So why are we focused on CO2 mitigation via reduction in fossil fuel use?
Cooling the surface via reforestation
A few months ago NoTricksZone featured a new study that determined global warming can be reversed via land cover changes. Forest losses can warm local temperatures by as much as 1°C within 10 years (Alkama and Cescatti, 2016).
Huang et al., 2020 found the opposite can occur too. When a region returns to forest and tree cover, cooling ensues.
And with a growing percentage of European forested areas returning, a “predominant regional biophysical cooling” with “an average temperature change of −0.12 ± 0.20 °C, with widespread cooling (up to −1.0 °C) in western and central Europe in summer and spring” has swept across Europe due to land cover changes in recent decades.

Image Source: Huang et al., 2020
Another new study finds reforestation may cool the local surface climate by up to 6°C
Now, results from another new study (Novick et al., 2020) suggest reforestation can mitigate “deleterious effects of climate warming” as it dramatically cools surface temperatures. Cooling from reforestation can reach magnitudes of 2-3°C for the air above the surface and 4-6°C for surface climate.
Further, as has been reported here recently, forest expansion substantially expands the Earth carbon sink and removes CO2 from the atmosphere such that future forest expansion, or greening, could offset 17 years of equivalent human CO2 emissions by 2100.
This easily supersedes the effect of Paris Agreement CO2 mitigation policies and suggests that global warming and CO2 emissions mitigation could far more easily and inexpensively be achieved by focusing on reforestation rather than fossil fuel reduction policies.

Like the corona crisis, in the face of the climate crisis it’s time to seriously encroach on fundamental rights, says a German public law professor. Image: Leuphana University of Lüneburg. 
Germany, true to its DNA, is once again gravitating towards dictatorial rule. A number of leading figures are praising the corona restrictions as an example of what needs to be done to fight the climate crisis.
One example figure is German public law professor Thomas Schomerus, who writes at his blog that “lessons for the climate crisis can be drawn from the corona crisis.”
Make people fear for their lives, the German federal judge and law professor implies.
“Make public accept “even the most serious encroachments”
The only thing that is needed for the public acceptance of “stringent measures”, says Schomerus is communication made “in a transparent, comprehensible, science-based and multimedia-based manner”.

If this is done, he writes, “the population will be prepared to accept even the most serious encroachments on fundamental rights.”
Just as convincing as the fear of death
He writes that the concern about the future of children and grandchildren “can be just as convincing” as the fear of death by the Corona virus.
Schmoerus at his blog expresses that the current collapse of global air travel and massive economic slowdown – which involves millions of unemployed – as a positive thing for the environment and thus similar restrictions should be kept in place even after the corona crisis subsides.
“The fight against the virus can set an example in the fight against global warming,” he claims.
Climate crisis requires “freedom-limiting measures”
Schomerus, a specialist for public law for energy and environmental law, asks at his blog why the government doesn’t take the same strict action against climate that it is now taking against the Corona virus. He adds:
Both the corona crisis and the climate crisis require freedom-limiting measures. The earlier and more vigorously these are defined and implemented, the sooner the success that is vital for survival can be expected. In this respect, corona and climate protection measures do not differ in principle, but only on the time axis. The following also applies to climate protection: the earlier and the more far-reaching they are taken, the lower the ecological, economic and social follow-up costs.”
According to his blog, Thomas Schomerus is Professor of Public Law for Energy and Environmental Law at the Faculty of Sustainability, Leuphana University Lueneburg and Judge at the Higher Public Administration Court for Lower Saxony.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAccording to a new paper, the Earth’s ocean heat content time derivative (OHCTD) has been decreasing (-0.26 W/m²/decade) since 2000, coinciding with a similar deficit in the Earth’s energy imbalance (EEI). The authors acknowledge such trends are “surprising” considering greenhouse gas emissions have risen.

Earth’s energy budget imbalanced?
Global warming occurs when there is more energy coming in to the climate system than leaving. This results in a positive imbalance in the Earth’s energy budget.
Most studies claim the imbalance has been about +0.6 W/m² since the 2000s (Stephens et al., 2012, Llovel et al., 2013), although the uncertainty in the surface energy imbalance estimate reaches ±17 W/m² (Stephens et al., 2012). Uncertainty in the Earth’s energy imbalance is therefore more than 100 times larger than the total accumulated forcing for CO2 over a 10-year period (+0.2 W/m², Feldman et al., 2015).

Image Source: Stephens et al., 2012
A cooling global ocean?
Per the IPCC, 93% of “global warming” is manifested by rising trends in 0-2000 m ocean heat content (OHC) (IPCC AR5, Chapter 3).
In 2006 scientists published a paper in Geophysical Research Letters asserting global OHC had rapidly declined from 2003 to 2005.

Image Source: Lyman et al., 2006
Cooling must be corrected to show warming
Of course, a cooling ocean does not conform with climate models predicating ocean heat content should rise in tandem with CO2 emissions.
So the overseers of ocean heat content datasets set out to find a way to “correct” the data.
Sure enough, by 2007, NASA’s Josh Willis had discovered two biases that could explain the cooling. The OHC data could now be changed to show warming.
Josh Willis’s correcting-the-cooling feat was even featured in a NASA article blithely titled “Correcting Ocean Cooling” that same year.

Then a few years later, Loehle (2009) also found the global oceans had been cooling at a rate of -0.35 (±0.2) x 10²² Joules per year, but this time the cooling had extended from 2003 to 2008.

Image Source: Loehle, 2009
With “uncorrected” ocean data assessing a cooling trend from 2003 to 2008, it wasn’t long before the data overseers decided they must remove all the cooling from the record.
So they did.
Today, the period between 2003 and 2008 has been “corrected” to show a stint of rapid warming.

Image Source: Wikipedia
New paper: Earth’s energy imbalance in deficit since 2000
A new data analysis authored by three Belgian scientists (Dewitte et al., 2019) finds not only has there been more heat energy leaving than accumulating in the Earth’s climate system this century, but ocean heat content time derivative (OHCTD) has likewise been declining since the early 2000s.

Image Source: Dewitte et al., 2019
The authors assessed the trends in OHCTD during 1960-2015. They found that although there was a rising trend from 1982 to 2000, since 2000 the OHCTD trend has been decreasing at a rate of -0.26 W/m² per decade.
Compatibly, Dewitte and co-authors also determined there has been a declining trend (-0.16 ±0.11 W/m² per decade) in the Earth’s energy imbalance (EEI) from 2000-2018.
The scientists acknowledge that these trends may seem “surprising” at first given the sharp rise in greenhouse gas emissions in recent decades. But they find the agreement between the recent OHCTD and EEI trends “adds extra confidence” to their results.
Expect these results to be “corrected” by the data overseers in due time.

"Climate change is not only having a devastating impact on the environments we live in, but also on respect for human rights globally, the UN has warned.  The UN rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, cited the civil wars sparked by a warming planet and the plight of indigenous people in an Amazon ravaged by wildfires and rampant deforestation. She also denounced attacks on environmental activists, particularly in Latin America, and the abuse aimed at high-profile figures such as the teenage campaigner Greta Thunberg. “The world has never seen a threat to human rights of this scope,” she told the UN human rights council in Geneva. “The economies of all nations, the institutional, political, social and cultural fabric of every state, and the rights of all your people, and future generations, will be impacted” by climate change, she warned. The 42nd session of the council opened with a minute of silence for the victims of Hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas, where at least 44 have been killed and thousands of homes reduced to rubble. “The storm accelerated with unprecedented speed over an ocean warmed by climate shifts, becoming one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes ever to hit land,” Bachelet said. Low-lying small island states like the Bahamas, which are heavily affected by climate change, are quickly seeing rights to water, sanitation, health, food, work and adequate housing, she warned. She called for international action to mitigate the impact there. The UN high commissioner for human rights also denounced the “drastic acceleration of deforestation of the Amazon. “The fires currently raging across the rainforest may have catastrophic impact on humanity as a whole, but their worst effects are suffered by the women, men and children who live in these areas,” she said. She urged authorities in Bolivia, Paraguay and Brazil to “ensure the implementation of longstanding environmental policies … thus preventing future tragedies”. Bachelet’s comments risk further angering the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, who last week accused her of meddling in his country’s affairs after she criticised the deteriorating rights situation there. The UN rights chief also highlighted the impact climate change is having on insecurity around the world. She cited a UN estimate that 40% of civil wars over the past six decades have been linked to environmental degradation. In the Sahel region of Africa for instance, degradation of arable land “is intensifying competition for already scarce resources”, she said. This in turn exacerbates ethnic tensions, and fuels violence and political instability, she added. Bachelet lamented that those sounding the alarm over the devastating impacts of climate change are often attacked. UN experts, she said, had “noted attacks on environmental human rights defenders in virtually every region, particularly in Latin America”. “I am disheartened by this violence, and also by the verbal attacks on young activists such as Greta Thunberg and others, who galvanise support for prevention of the harm their generation may bear,” Bachelet said. “The demands made by environmental defenders and activists are compelling, and we should respect, protect and fulfil their rights.”"
"Britain is to host a crunch climate conference next year at which the future direction of global efforts to avert the climate crisis will be determined, the government has confirmed. The COP26 meeting, under the auspices of the UN, will take place in Glasgow in December 2020, with about 30,000 delegates expected as well as leaders of most of the world’s governments, making it the biggest international summit to be hosted in the UK.  After months of behind-the-scenes preparations, the UK was confirmed as co-host with Italy, where some preparatory meetings will take place, when other countries signalled their acceptance on Tuesday. The announcement shines a spotlight on the UK’s diplomatic standing on the world stage after Brexit and will bring intense scrutiny of the British government’s actions on the climate emergency. Before her departure, one of Theresa May’s final acts as prime minister was to enshrine in law a commitment to ensure the country had net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, said: “The UK has just received a huge vote of confidence from our international partners. We’re ready to bring the world together to make sure we leave our previous environment in a better state for our children.” Kicking off the government’s global diplomatic push, which will encompass developing as well as developed countries, the Department for International Development said British overseas aid had helped poor and vulnerable nations cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 16m tonnes in the past eight years, the equivalent of taking 3m cars off the road for a year. These included projects to provide clean energy in Kenya, Rwanda and Mali, and helping farmers grow climate-resilient crops or put in measures to save water. Alok Sharma, the international development secretary, said: “This nomination [to host COP26] is testimony to the UK’s leading role in the fight against climate change. UK aid has helped millions of people in developing countries to access clean energy and prepare for the impacts of climate change.” Civil society groups and businesses also called for the UK to take action on its net-zero commitment as part of the hosting role. Tanya Steele, the chief executive of WWF UK, said: “This is a real opportunity for us to showcase our vision of a greener future, powered by renewable energy, with flourishing sustainable industries and a restored natural world. “But if we want other countries to follow our lead, we will have to be able to show that we have backed our bold commitments with concrete action.” Stephanie Pfeifer, the chief executive of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, said: “The UK should use its diplomatic influence to encourage other countries to make similar pledges [to reduce carbon to net zero] in the run-up to the summit to ensure it’s a success.” However, some experts are worried Brexit will distract ministers and officials from climate issues. The conference will be the most important on the climate since the Paris agreement was passed in 2015, because the future of the pledges countries made will be reviewed. Nations agreed to a legally binding commitment in Paris to keep global temperature rises to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, but also offered national pledges to cut or curb their greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Those pledges were insufficient to meet the 2C requirement, so governments will be expected to come up with more ambitious offerings in 2020. Progress made to date will also be assessed. Most countries, including the US, China, India and the UK, as well as the EU, have national or bloc-wide pledges to cut or curb greenhouse gas emissions growth by 2020, agreed before Paris, so auditing whether these are met will be a key aim. Probably the most watched effect on the talks, however, will be the outcome of the US presidential election, which takes place on 3 November 2020, weeks before the conference. Donald Trump has begun the process of withdrawing the US from the Paris agreement, but withdrawal cannot legally take place until 4 November next year."

Share this...FacebookTwitterSina, aged 14, used to be active as a spokesperson for Fridays for Future in a city in the German state of North Rhine Westphalia. 
But she quickly became disenchanted by the movement’s “cult-like” structures which did not tolerate questions. Recently she revealed her story. 

Hat-tip: EIKE
Sina began her environmental activism by joining a demonstration against coal power plants, organized by Greenpeace and WWF, before getting involved as a press spokesperson in the FFF movement in March; 2019.
In the interview, she reports on cult-like control, censorship, hostility and left-wing infiltration.
By November, 2019, she began questioning the movement. As press spokesperson, she says she recalls having an older organizer constantly standing at her side at the demonstrations to make sure she said “the right things” when interviewed by radio or television.
“No matter what was asked, it had to be answered like this or like that” and we had to “sound dramatic and to not express any doubts about it,” Sina tells GROSSE FREIHEIT TV (Great Freedom TV) in the interview.
Constantly watched
“We have to act immediately, otherwise things will go like so, and the world will fall apart if you don’t take to the streets, and those who don’t are to blame for the world collapsing and all such things that put pressure on people,” said Sina, explaining what the organizers expected the press spokeschildren to say to the media.

According to Sina:

One question from the press has always been very popular, and that is what you do yourself for climate protection. A very clear guideline was the answer that one should live vegan, plastic-free, seasonal and regional, as well as avoid car journeys and flights as far as possible. I believe, that is also the first thing I learned there.”

Began to have doubts
In the interview, the sharp-witted teen explains how she began to have doubts about the movement when the question of a CO2 tax came up and her father had doubts about it. This made Sina think about the implications of shutting down the coal power plants and the financial implications.
“The demands were so dogmatic and radical” that “they they could not really be implemented,” she says in the interview. She then explains how she researched the subject and found out that the 97% claimed consensus was bogus.
Insults and attacks…”Nazi” …”climate denier”
When her doubts and skepticism became known, she recounts how immediately she was accused of acting like a Nazi, and getting labelled a “climate denier” and “future destroyer”.  At that point she had had enough and ditched the movement.
“Cult character”
At the 20:35-mark, having been asked to describe how she sees the FFF movement, shes says: “In my view, it has a sort of cult character because you have to have that opinion. Otherwise you’ll be insulted out, if you will.”
She then adds: “They make demands without even thinking about solutions and thinking about the consequences of immediately exiting coal power.”
She adds: “High taxes isn’t going to buy the CO2 out of the air.”
Her advice: “Do a little research”
Later she describes how dissent is absolutely not tolerated by the movement in any way. At school some of the more extreme teachers “couldn’t understand” why she exited the movement and how she was confronted by other radical classmates: “If you don’t take part, then it will be your fault that none of us will have a future and we’ll all die.” She responded to them: “Just do a little research!”

"Major oil and gas companies have invested $50bn (£40.6bn) in fossil fuel projects that undermine global efforts to avert a runaway climate crisis, according to a report. Since the start of last year, fossil fuel companies have spent billions on high-cost plans to extract oil and gas from tar sands, deepwater fields and the Arctic despite the risks to the climate and shareholder returns.  Carbon Tracker, a financial thinktank, found that ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell and BP each spent at least 30% of their investment in 2018 on projects that are inconsistent with climate targets, and would be “deep out of the money in a low-carbon world”. Andrew Grant, the author of the report, said: “Every oil major is betting heavily against a 1.5C world and investing in projects that are contrary to the Paris goals.” The study is the first to analyse individual projects to test whether they are compliant with a 1.5C world, and whether they would be financially sustainable in a low-carbon world. It found that none of the largest listed oil and gas companies are making investment decisions that are in line with global climate goals, and risk wasting $2.2tn (£1.8tn) by 2030 if governments take a tougher stance on carbon emissions. Last year Shell said it would spend $13bn on a liquefied natural gas project in Canada and ExxonMobil agreed to invest $2.6bn in the Aspen project in Canada, the first greenfield oil sands project in five years. “Investors should challenge companies’ spending on new fossil fuel production. The best way to both preserve shareholder value in the transition and align with climate change goals will be to focus on low-cost projects that will deliver the highest returns,” Grant said. The report contradicts the public rhetoric of many oil executives who have claimed to support the Paris goals and vowed to invest in renewable energy projects. A spokesperson for Shell said: “We agree that the world is not moving fast enough to tackle climate change. As the energy system evolves, so is our business, to provide the mix of products that our customers need.” A report from the UN Environment Programme has revealed that global investment in renewable energy projects over the last decade is on track to reach $2.6tn by the end of this year. The investment boom has almost quadrupled the world’s total renewable energy capacity from 414GW at the end of 2009 to an expected total of 1,650GW by the end of this year. Inger Andersen, the executive director of the UN Environment Programme, said: “Investing in renewable energy is investing in a sustainable and profitable future, as the last decade of incredible growth in renewables has shown.” The report, co-authored by BloombergNEF, showed that solar power projects led the rise in renewables. Solar power attracted around half of the total investment in renewables over the last decade and has grown from 25GW at the beginning of 2010 to an expected 638GW by the close of 2019. Jon Moore, the chief executive of BloombergNEF, said the sharp falls in the cost of electricity from wind and solar over recent years has “transformed the choice facing policymakers”. “These technologies were always low carbon and relatively quick to build. Now, in many countries around the world, either wind or solar is the cheapest option for electricity generation,” he said. However, Andersen warned that governments cannot be complacent about the growth of renewable energy if they hope to meet the UN’s climate targets. “Global power sector emissions have risen about 10% over this period. It is clear that we need to rapidly step up the pace of the global switch to renewables if we are to meet international climate and development goals,” she said. Renewable energy made up 12.9% of the world’s total electricity use last year, up from 11.6% the year before."

Share this...FacebookTwitterCOVID-19 has not only been a nightmare for the public worldwide, but especially for “climate crisis” alarmists who have seen their agenda disappear from the media radar. And it’s going to stay off the radar for quite some time. People can take only so much panic and restriction.
Once the COVID-19 crisis subsides, and it will in a few months, the global citizenry will be in absolutely no mood to keep on panicking. They’ll want to go back to the prosperity they previously enjoyed.
“Enough sacrifice and restrictions,” they’ll be saying.
Far lower urgency
There are several reasons the climate crisis isn’t going to come back soon.
First off, it’s human nature to address only dangers that are truly present. Though many believe there’s a climate crisis, it’s one that is perceived to be years, even decades, off into the future. So there’s no sense of real urgency like the immediate sort we’ve been seeing with COVID-19. So what if sea level rises 2 feet by 2100. I can move in 30 years – long before it ever gets here!
People will be sick and tired of panic
Secondly, by the time COVID-19 passes, citizens will be sick and tired of panicking, and they aren’t going to be in the mood for a continued high level panic over something far, far less urgent. They’ll have had enough of lock downs and sacrificing and aren’t going to be very open to sacrificing for the weather.
Too many people aren’t buying the flaky climate crisis “science”
A third reason is that the climate crisis is still highly uncertain and increasingly hotly disputed. Much of the science behind it is flimsy. While it has been crystal clear that COVID-19 is urgent, especially for the elderly, the climate crisis is fraught with huge uncertainties and flaky science. Too many people just aren’t buying it. They’re going to take the let’s-wait-and-see attitude before flying off the handle again.
The media aren’t going to keep up the high panic



Fourthly, the media can’t devote the same attention to the “climate crisis” that they did to COVID-19 simply because people would just tune them out, and rightly so. Enough is enough. People will want to get back to normalcy. Who in their right mind would want to spend the rest of his life in a state of panic like the alarmists propose?

Why would people — already fatigued by the COVID-19 panic — worry about a climate doomsday when summer is finally there?
And despite all the hype surrounding Greta and Fridays for Future, a recent study by the organization Media Matters, revealed that there was only 238 minutes of climate crisis coverage by major US networks in 2019!
So after COVID-19 subsides, the networks aren’t going to keep crying doomsday. They know they’ll be tuned out totally if they do.
The climate crisis had gotten little attention

Chart: Media Matters
Gotten so old
Moreover the climate warnings have been going on more than 30 years now and people had been tuning them out already, and for good reason. Life on the planet by most measures is far better today. All the dire predictions made in the 1990s and 2000s never came to pass.
Political suicide
Finally politicians will be very wary about calling for more pain to combat a distant, dubious threat. Doing so after going through the pain of COVID-19 would be tantamount to political suicide.
Dictatorship as the last hope for the climate crisis?
“As heretical as it may sound, there are valid questions to be raised about whether a democratic system with regular elections is suited to dealing with an issue that requires short-term sacrifice for long-term benefits,” wrote Joe Wiggins, a researcher in fund management.
Good luck with that.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA new 5680-year tree-ring temperature reconstruction for southern South America (Lara et al., 2020) reveals (a) no clear warming trend in recent decades, and (b) the 18th and 19th centuries (and many centennial-scale periods from the last 5680 years) had much warmer temperatures than today.

Image Source: Lara et al., 2020
In addition to finding modern temperature changes in southern South America fall well within the range of natural variability in the context of the last 5680 years, Lara et al. (2020) assess solar forcing to have contributed to climate variations for this region of the Southern Hemisphere.
The authors find CO2 fertilization can explain trees’ improved water use efficiency and tree-ring growth in general; this affects the capacity for tree-rings to be a proxy for long-term temperature variability.
They emphasize this composite tree-ring record is “the longest in the Southern Hemisphere.”
Lara et al., 2020
“The most outstanding features in the reconstruction presented here are two major warm periods between 3140–2800 BC and 70 BC – 150 AD (5159–4819 and 2089–1869 years ago, respectively, counted from 2019 to facilitate comparisons with glacier records based on 10Be dated moraines). During these warm periods, no glacier advances have been reported for Patagonia (Aniya, 2013; Kaplan et al., 2016; Strelin et al., 2014, Fig. 5A).”
“Reconstructed mean maximum temperature in our record shows warmer conditions during the 19th century (1780–1880 AD) than in the 20th century (Fig. 3D and Figs. 3D and S3). This pattern coincides with above average spring-summer temperatures during the 19th century, reconstructed from a completely independent 600-year record based on varved sediments from El Plomo Lake, Patagonia at 47° S (Elbert et al., 2015; Fig. S3, r = 0.22, p < 0.001, for the period 1780–2009). This is the warmest period in the entire El Plomo record (Elbert et al., 2015). Particularly warm summer conditions in the 1800s were also reported for Laguna Escondida in western Patagonia at ∼45° S (Elbert et al., 2013) and for northern Argentinean Patagonia (Villalba, 1990). The 1775–1804 period has also been described as the warmest 30-year period in a millennial reconstruction for South America, south of 20° S (Neukom et al., 2011).”

“The subdued warming pattern during recent decades in our record is consistent with reports from instrumental records for southern Chile (38°–48°S), where there are no clear temperature patterns or significant trends reported over the period 1979–2009 (Falvey and Garreaud, 2009).”
Consistent with the patterns documented in this paper, low frequency reconstructed cold temperature anomalies for the NH and periods of minimal solar activity were variable with periods of coincidences and discrepancies during the last 1200 years (Anchukaitis et al., 2017). Changes in large scale NH circulation are thought to provide a possible mechanism for these differences (Anchukaitis et al., 2017). The two major periods with positive anomalies in our reconstruction (3140–2800 BC and 70 BC-150 AD), coincide with positive anomalies of solar irradiance, but the deviations in the TSI are proportionally smaller in the latter period (Fig. 5A).
“A strong CO2 fertilization effect has been the main explanation for the significant increase in water-use efficiency (WUE) reported for Northern Hemisphere temperate and boreal forests over the recent two decades (Keenan et al., 2013).”
“The increasing growth trend and decreasing isotope discrimination in Fitzroya have been attributed to a raise in photosynthetic rates, which has been caused by increased CO2 and/or higher surface radiation, the latter associated with a reduction in cloudiness in a high precipitation area (Urrutia-Jalabert et al., 2015a). In the eastern slope of the northern Patagonian Andes, Argentina, under lower rainfall and cloudiness than in the Chilean western slope, a marked increase in Fitzroya tree-ring growth during the 20th century has also been recorded and attributed to increased CO2 concentration (Lavergne et al., 2018). The coincident Fitzroya growth patterns in two areas of contrasting cloud cover is an additional support for the attribution of CO2 fertilization in this species.”
For good measure, Lara et al., (2020) point out that “a cooling trend has been reported along the Pacific coast (17° – 37° S) of South America for the periods 1979–2006 and 1981–2012 (Falvey and Garreaud, 2009; Hartmann et al., 2013).”
This cooling record is consistent with instrumental records from the dozens of temperature stations all across the central and southern regions of South America which also show cooling/no warming in recent decades (Lansner and Pepke-Pedersen, 2018).

We’ve been hearing much fake news about the Australian bush fires supposedly having been caused by man-made climate change. Yet it has emerged that Australian authorities were warned years ago that poor land management practices were in fact escalating the risk of devastating fires, according to an expert.
Forest fuel level highest in 1000 years
In 2015, bush fire scientist David Packham warned of a “huge blaze threat” and urged an “increase in fuel reduction burns”.
“Forest fuel levels had climbed to their most dangerous level in thousands of years,” wrote Darren Gray here in 2015. Today the public is being misled by climate alarmists and the media on the real causes of the devastating bush fires now taking place.
In fact NASA data shows that the area burned by global wildfires dropped by 25% since 2003, according to the Global Warming Policy Forum (GWPF)

Misleading temperature trends
Unfortunately, deception is not only taking place in the communication of Australian bush fires, but also authorities (NASA GISS) are grossly misleading the public in terms of temperature trends in Australia.

What follows are the curves of six Australian station that go back to the late 19th century. The comparator shows the plots of GISS “unadjusted data compared to the “homogenized” data:

Data: NASA GISS
Before the homogenization, the unadjusted data from 4 of the 6 stations showed cooling. 
But after NASA changed the data, the cooling disappeared and all 6 stations showed warming!
Looking at the three stations Yamba. Moruya and Darwin, here we see that NASA dropped the early part of the temperature record (because they showed warm temperatures?). The result of course is a greater warming trend.
Look at NASA GISS data plots for Darwin Airport for example. See the huge differences between the versions:

So whenever people claim warming is man-made, they are right. But it’s not so much because of the CO2 emitted by man, but rather it is because of the statistical fudging of data at NASA GISS.

By Die kalte Sonne
[German text translated/edited by P Gosselin]
IPCC authors “politically handpicked”
The IPCC climate status report serves as an important reference for climate policy and public discussion. However, very few people are aware that the authors of the report are politically hand-picked. Although anyone can apply as an author to the national IPCC committees, the selection process is not transparent behind closed doors. The IPCC had to take a lot of criticism for this, but persists in its exclusionary line.
Thus critics have no chance to participate in the climate referee reports.
Huge uncertainty persists
The 6th IPCC report (Assessment Report 6, AR6) is currently being prepared. The first round of reviews has been completed and work on the second draft is in full swing. One of the central topics of each report is the warming effect of CO2, so-called CO2 climate sensitivity. Hardly anything has changed in the last 30 years. The value is still very poorly known and ranges from “we have to keep an eye on it” to “catastrophically strong warming”. In numbers: 1.5°C to 4.5°C warming per CO2 doubling.
Climate sensitivity in the lower range
In recent years it has become increasingly clear that the value is probably located in the lower half of the IPCC range. So it will be interesting to see how the AR6 deals with this. But don’t hold your breath because the IPCC seems to be true to its alarmist line, despite many published references to a lower warming by CO2.
Model Chaos
Paul Voosen spoke on this in Science on 16 April 2019. The IPCC modelers had “improved” some processes in their climate simulations and were then quite surprised that the models suddenly ran much hotter than before. The CO2 climate sensitivity was now suddenly above the range previously thought possible, namely 5°C. The climate sensitivity of the models was suddenly much higher than before. Wow! The alarmists celebrated a feast of joy. However, more serious colleagues obviously threw sand in the alarmist gears and reported concerns.
Excerpt from Voosen’s article:
New climate models predict a warming surge 
For nearly 40 years, the massive computer models used to simulate global climate have delivered a fairly consistent picture of how fast human carbon emissions might warm the world. But a host of global climate models developed for the United Nations’s next major assessment of global warming, due in 2021, are now showing a puzzling but undeniable trend. They are running hotter than they have in the past. Soon the world could be, too.
In earlier models, doubling atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) over preindustrial levels led models to predict somewhere between 2°C and 4.5°C of warming once the planet came into balance. But in at least eight of the next-generation models, produced by leading centers in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and France, that “equilibrium climate sensitivity” has come in at 5°C or warmer. Modelers are struggling to identify which of their refinements explain this heightened sensitivity before the next assessment from the United Nations’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). But the trend “is definitely real. There’s no question,” says Reto Knutti, a climate scientist at ETH Zurich in Switzerland. “Is that realistic or not? At this point, we don’t know.
[…] Many scientists are skeptical, pointing out that past climate changes recorded in ice cores and elsewhere don’t support the high climate sensitivity—nor does the pace of modern warming. The results so far are “not sufficient to convince me,” says Kate Marvel, a climate scientist at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York City. In the effort to account for atmospheric components that are too small to directly simulate, like clouds, the new models could easily have strayed from reality, she says. “That’s always going to be a bumpy road.”
“Modelers at a loss”
CO2 climate sensitivity remains uncertain, modelers are at a loss. They had planned everything so beautifully for the AR6. Shortly before the end of the work, they quickly installed a new aerosolset, which then knocked everything down. The models suddenly showed hardly any warming for the 20th century. Ouch!
Perhaps the modelers were closer to the truth than they had thought, since there was now plenty of room for natural climatic factors, which they had previously set to zero as a precaution. So the models were completely changed again. And that finally led to the crazy high values of 5°C per CO2 doubling. Read for yourself:
Late in the model’s development cycle, however, the NCAR group incorporated an updated data set on emissions of aerosols
The aerosol data threw everything off when the model simulated the climate of the 20th century, it now showed hardly any warming. “It took us about a year to work that out,” says NCAR’s Andrew Gettelman, who helped lead the development of the model. But the aerosols may play a role in the higher sensitivity that the modelers now see, perhaps by affecting the thickness and extent of low ocean clouds. “We’re trying to understand if other [model developers] went through the same process,” Gettelman says.”
What consequences does the modeling chaos have for AR6?
In assessing how fast climate may change, the next IPCC report probably won’t lean as heavily on models as past reports did, says Thorsten Mauritsen, a climate scientist at Stockholm University and an IPCC author. It will look to other evidence as well, in particular a large study in preparation that will use ancient climates and observations of recent climate change to constrain sensitivity.”

“Total failure by climate models”
The AR6 will not be able to rely on the simulations and must therefore focus more on other areas of argumentation. But one thing is as certain as an “amen” in Church: The IPCC will claim that the temperature forecasts have become much more reliable than in the previous report, despite the total failure of the climate models. Although this makes no sense at all, it is politically necessary.
The way out: The new hockey stick curve that PAGES2k was able to publish in Nature Geoscience just in time, at the end of July 2019.
:

Figure: Global temperature reconstruction of the last 2000 years according to PAGES2k 2019.
If you thought Michael Mann’s hockey stick had suffered its final blow recently, then you are mistaken. Fact is: A new hockey stick was born in July 2019. Exactly to be used in the IPCC report. It is rumored that the curve was already included in the first draft of the AR6, although it wasn’t even released then. Mysterious.
MWP only 0.3°C warmer than Little Ice Age?
The Medieval Warm Period is ironed flat and is only 0.3°C warmer than the Little Ice Age. Wow. Are these the “ancient climates” which Voosen addresses in his contribution and form the new basis of argumentation?
PAGES2k shortcomings
A closer look at the PAGES2k database reveals a number of shortcomings. First, a large number of tree rings are used, of which only a few have been formally published as case studies. Example: The study uses tree rings from the French Maritime Alps, although a specialist publication on the region clearly advises against using such tree rings there as temperature proxies.
This is not an isolated case. If one goes through the PAGES2k database in detail, one finds a whole series of dubious practices, which were obviously overlooked by the peer review. Read about them in the following papers:

Authors ignoring important publications
It is also noticeable that the PAGES2k paper does not cite any of the recent publications on the medieval climate anomaly, although the medieval climate is one of the most important topics in the area of palaeoclimatology. At least two of the publications were accessible to PAGES2k authors (others appeared later), but were ignored for unknown reasons.  The papers were able to demonstrate medieval warming throughout the southern hemisphere. Some smaller areas also cooled at the same time, similar to today’s active temperature seesaws and coastal upwelling areas.
Questionable database
In the northern hemisphere the Medieval Warm Period was always known. In this respect, it is an absolute mystery as to how the new hockey stick fix came about, if not through a questionable database.
Conclusion: “climate chaos”
It is time for the IPCC to open up to criticism. The climate models are out of control, as are the paleo-climatic reconstructions. What remains is climate chaos. It is time for a scientifically sustainable new beginning in which criticism is seriously heard and integrated. The exclusion of critics was a historic mistake that is now falling on the IPCC’s feet.

If rising CO2 concentrations are a driver of Arctic warming, the 19th and 20th centuries should presumably have been much colder than today.
A new study (Wangner et al., 2020) instead finds there were:
(a) warming and cooling episodes of multiple degrees per decade throughout the last ~215 years in southeast Greenland;
(b) decadal periods in the 1800s were occasionally warmer than 2013; and
(c) more sustained warming in the 1920s and 1940s than during the 21st century.

"Britain has one of the world’s best capabilities for dealing with the climate crisis but is failing to make use of it. That is the stark view of leading expert Baroness Brown, a member of the UK Committee on Climate Change. “We have the ingredients to do good things in response to climate change but are not making use of them,” she warned last week.  Brown, who chairs the CCC’s adaptation sub-committee, said little progress had been made in planning to protect farmland and wildlife from intense storms and changing weather systems, or tackle health threats from rising heat – with grim short-term political consequences.  The UK has pledged to persuade other governments at the UN climate change summit in New York this month to commit more to adaptation. But Bob Ward of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment said: “Britain’s failure to adapt to our changing climate could severely undermine efforts to persuade other countries to invest more in resilience. The UK may have a good track record of helping poor countries to become more resilient but we are not doing enough. The country needs to lead by example.” The UK is bidding to host another international summit, that is to be held in December 2020, the fifth anniversary of the Paris climate agreement. “If the UK wants to host that crucial summit, which will dictate the path we take to combating global warming, we will need to be seen to be doing a lot more about climate change,” added Ward. The nation’s failure to adapt to changing conditions was underlined this summer when severe flooding crippled train schedules, temperatures reached record levels and residents of Whaley Bridge, in Derbyshire, were evacuated after heavy rain damaged a dam on a nearby reservoir. Much worse is predicted for the next few decades but little is being done to protect the nation’s infrastructure - such as adapting care homes and hospitals so residents and patients do not suffer as temperatures soar or protecting coastal towns against rising sea levels.  “Yet we also possess powerful agencies like the Met Office,” said Brown. “It is developing detailed climate predictions for regions with an accuracy of a few kilometres. But we are not making use of these capabilities.” In fact, the priority given to adaptation to these threats has been eroded over the past 10 years. “We have been distracted by Brexit,” Brown added. She pointed to pressures on the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, which is in charge of ensuring Britain adapts to the climate crisis but has been concentrating on finding replacements for the EU common agricultural policy and dealing with other Brexit-related issues. In July, the CCC warned that the country was not prepared for even a 2C rise in temperatures, let alone more extreme warming. “Many policies still lack a basic acknowledgement of climate change, while others make a passing mention but have no associated actions to reduce risk.”"
"Australia’s minister responsible for drought and natural disasters, David Littleproud, has said that he doesn’t “know if climate change is manmade”. Clarifying earlier comments that the question is “irrelevant” when considering the Coalition government’s response to intensifying bushfires, he told Guardian Australia he was unsure about the causes of the climate crisis but wanted to give the country the tools to adapt.  The remarks by the minister for water resources, drought, natural disaster and emergency management are likely to anger political opponents, including the Greens who have targeted Littleproud and fellow members of the National party for refusing to acknowledge a link between human-induced climate change and bushfires. Littleproud’s position was supported by the Nationals deputy leader, Bridget McKenzie, the minister for resources and northern Australia, Matt Canavan, and the environment minister, Sussan Ley, all of who denied knowledge of or downplayed the link. Early spring bushfires in Queensland may go on for weeks, authorities said, while firefighters on Tuesday were battling more than 50 fires in New South Wales. The overall fire danger index has increased for most of southern Australia over the past 40 years and the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre says the trend is expected to continue. Does climate change cause bushfires? The link between rising greenhouse gas emissions and increased bushfire risk is complex but, according to major science agencies, clear. Climate change does not create bushfires, but it can and does make them worse. A number of factors contribute to bushfire risk, including temperature, fuel load, dryness, wind speed and humidity.  What is the evidence on rising temperatures?  The Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO say Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910 and temperatures will increase in the future. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says it is extremely likely increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases since the mid-20th century is the main reason it is getting hotter. The Bushfire and Natural Hazards research centre says the variability of normal events sits on top of that. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk. What other effects do carbon emissions have? Dry fuel load - the amount of forest and scrub available to burn - has been linked to rising emissions. Under the right conditions, carbon dioxide acts as a kind of fertiliser that increases plant growth.  So is climate change making everything dryer?  Dryness is more complicated. Complex computer models have not found a consistent climate change signal linked to rising CO2 in the decline in rain that has produced the current eastern Australian drought. But higher temperatures accelerate evaporation. They also extend the growing season for vegetation in many regions, leading to greater transpiration (the process by which water is drawn from the soil and evaporated from plant leaves and flowers). The result is that soils, vegetation and the air may be drier than they would have been with the same amount of rainfall in the past. What do recent weather patterns show? The year coming into the 2019-20 summer has been unusually warm and dry for large parts of Australia. Above average temperatures now occur most years and 2019 has been the fifth driest start to the year on record, and the driest since 1970. Is arson a factor in this year's extreme bushfires? Not a significant one. Two pieces of disinformation, that an “arson emergency”, rather than climate change, is behind the bushfires, and that “greenies” are preventing firefighters from reducing fuel loads in the Australian bush have spread across social media. They have found their way into major news outlets, the mouths of government MPs, and across the globe to Donald Trump Jr and prominent right-wing conspiracy theorists. NSW’s Rural Fire Service has said the major cause of ignition during the crisis has been dry lightning. Victoria police say they do not believe arson had a role in any of the destructive fires this summer. The RFS has also contradicted claims that environmentalists have been holding up hazard reduction work. On Monday, Littleproud told ABC’s Radio National that Australia has been “adapting to a changing climate since we first settled this country and we’ll have to continue to do that and do that with the best science we’ve got available”. When asked whether human-induced climate change is making bushfires more intense, Littleproud replied: “We’re adapting to it as the climate continues to change and we’ll continue to equip our service workers … Whether it’s manmade or not is irrelevant.” The minister suggested there were “extremes from both sides” of the debate which should be about “do we want to breathe healthy air”. He said his job was to ensure emergency services “are given the tools and resources they need, [and] they have the science to understand that these events could become more severe”. Asked by Guardian Australia why he had avoided taking a position on the effect of manmade climate change, Littleproud replied: “I don’t know if climate change is manmade. “I’m about practical outcomes, whether that’s about having a cleaner environment or giving farmers and emergency services the right tools to adapt,” he said. “I am responsible for making sure we have the tools we need to adapt to a changing climate.” On Monday, the Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, used Senate question time to target Littleproud for his original answer, suggesting he was in effect dismissing the concerns of emergency services chiefs who have warned of climate change’s contribution to fires. The agriculture minister, Bridget McKenzie, rebuked Di Natale for “politicising bushfires which right now are affecting landholders, homes, environmental assets and farmers in communities in Queensland and north-east NSW”. McKenzie – answering on behalf of Littleproud – said the minister and she had been “very upfront … about the fact that the climate is changing”. “There is variability around the climate.” Asked if she accepted that human-induced climate change is making bushfires worse, McKenzie replied: “Our government has made very clear that we take climate change seriously.” On Tuesday Di Natale repeated the tactic – this time targeting Canavan, who again accused the Greens of using the tragedy in “combustible fashion” to further the party’s own political cause. Canavan quoted a NSW environment department report which suggested there was “considerable uncertainty” of the impact of climate change on bushfire risk, although the report concluded it will likely increase bushfire risk. Canavan said the Liberal-National Coalition supported “sensible responses to climate change that included support for the high-quality coal and gas that we produce in this country”. “It is through the high-quality production of energy that we will respond to climate change and reduce emissions,” he said. Ley told ABC Radio that she doesn’t know “what caused this particular fire on this particular day”. “We have always lived on a continent which has been ravaged by fires, I am not going to become an expert on what is causing the fires,” she said. “I am sure it is related to climate change, to what degree and under what circumstances, and what actions we could be taking, there is a whole range of other conversations around that.” Earlier on Tuesday, four Coalition MPs raised the issue of drought and natural disasters in the joint party room, urging practical options to help regional businesses including shops that are not eligible for drought assistance. Several others raised the issue of insurance in north Queensland, which is subject to monsoonal troughs and severe tropical cyclones. The MPs complained of exorbitant premium rises of between 300% and 500% and argued the situation is a market failure with insurers warning it is no longer profitable to insure areas including Townsville. The MPs suggested reducing regulatory barriers to encourage smaller insurers or mutuals to offer insurance. Scott Morrison directed the assistant treasurer, Michael Sukkar, to meet northern Queensland MPs; Sukkar said he was already working with the competition regulator on the issue."

Share this...FacebookTwitterHappy birthday EEG! The now famous German green energy feed-in act celebrates its 20-year birthday.
The law is loved and hated by many. While activists like Claudia Kemfert wish that the lavish subsidies would get expanded even further, others have different views on the situation.
Cost explosion
Former environment minister Jürgen Trittin’s scoop of ice cream, the equivalent amount the EEG was supposed to cost German citizens each month (about 1 euro), has become a running gag. Examples are Volker Andres from ZDF German public television and Daniel Wetzel of news daily WELT.
Andres:
And something else is going wrong: The EEG, which is almost unchanged in its system, sends the wrong price signal to us consumers. Green electricity costs around 30 cents per kilowatt hour. The pure electricity production is between four and eight cents, depending on the plant and source”.
Wetzel:

Also because financially interested lobby groups stylized the EEG as a panacea and drew all political attention to this rich cornucopia, the greening of the other consumer sectors failed to materialize.”
For years, the EEG remunerated electricity production volumes at any level regardless of demand. This introduced a kind of ton ideology into energy policy: only the masses of green kilowatt hours produced counted. The fact that it must also be possible to transport, store and use them somehow became a minor matter.”
Today the EEG is of course costing consumers exorbitantly more than just the value of a scoop of ice cream each month.
“According to figures from the comparison and brokerage portal Verivox, 86 utilities have announced average price increases of 8.1 percent for the months February to April,” wrote Germany’s flagship Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) here. “For a family with an annual consumption of 4000 kilowatt hours, this would mean additional costs of around 100 euros per year.”
Costly, destructive and unhealthy
Not only are Germans paying among the highest electricity rates in the world, but the supply has become unstable, the landscape has become littered with turbines that operate sporadically, kill birds, destroy natural biotopes and make people sick with their low frequency emissions.

By Dr. Andreas Mueller
(Summarized by P. Gosselin)
Last weekend the climate conference by the Germany-based European Institute for Climate and Energy EIKE took place in Munich, despite threats by leftist radicals.
More than a dozen leading international climate experts presented views that severely challenge mainstream alarmist climate science.
1. Alps glaciers smaller than today during much of the Holocene
Among the speakers was Prof. em. Christian Schlüchter is a leading Swiss geologist who studied the glaciers of the Alps in great detail for decades. In his talk he reported his findings from very old timber found in and below glaciers, and what those ancient tree remnants tell us about the glacial epochs of the Alps.

Image: EIKE
Schlüchter’s findings involve paleoclimatic records (timber, turfs, insects, etc.) found and dated using 14C as a standard method. The most important slide of his talk shows the last 12,000 years:

Image: EIKE
His findings show that for long periods of time in the last 12,000 years, temperatures were higher than in 2005.  Early on, from 10,000 to 8,800 BC, and again in the last few hundred years, temperatures were significantly lower.
The key message is that the alpine glacier extent was often smaller than in 2005. The timberline was at least 300 meters higher, which indicates a minimum of 1.8° C higher temperatures than today. An example of this is Hannibal, who managed to cross the Alps with elephants during the Roman times.
Schlüchter summarized that more than 50% of the last 11000 years alpine glaciers were smaller than 2005 and that events of glacier growth were fast and short. Also the little ice age (from the end of the medieval warm period to about 1850) was the longest glacier extension since the last ice age 12,000 years ago,
2. IPCC models have substantial shortcomings
Also speaking at the conference was Italian physicist and climate modeler Nicola Scafetta, a well-known critic of IPCC climate models. His talk in Munich again examined the substantial shortcomings of IPCC climate models:

Image: EIKE
Scafetta discussed several areas where the climate models constantly fail. A key case is the Medieval Warm Period, which he showed together with the Roman Warm Period and the Modern Warm Period:
On the following slide, Prof. Scafetta shows how the IPCC models (light blue line) fail to reproduce the Medieval Warm Period (red real data) in the left part of the chart:

Image: EIKE
According to Scafetta, the models the IPCC uses are not capable of reproducing climate variations, which follow periodic solar activity.
The following chart compares the IPCC 2013 models to that of his own model (yellow area):

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




Image: EIKE
Both are not perfect and so indeed contradict any claim that the “science is settled”. But Scafetta’s model appears to be much more on track than the IPCC models.
Scafetta concludes:

 
3. Nir Shaviv: CO2 climate sensitivity largely overestimated 
Renowned Israeli astrophysicist Nir Shaviv continued where Scafetta left off, presenting the IPCC world and its errors. Shaviv emphasized that the climate sensitivity of CO2 is unknown and largely overestimated by the IPCC:

Image: EIKE
The Israeli astrophysicist judged the IPCC leaving out the sun as a driver “a severe shortcoming”, saying that the IPCC overestimates climate sensitivity of CO2 at the expense of solar influences.
While IPCC modelers managed to hide this for 20th century data, it will lead to a serious overestimate of temperatures in the 21st when solar influences will be cooling, according to the the Israeli scientist. Shaviv therefore expects a much lower temperature rise than that predicted by the IPCC.
Shaviv summarized:

4. Sun, clouds have huge impact on climate, IPCC ignores
Danish physicist and climate researcher Henrik Svensmark talked how he found it more and more difficult to raise funding for his research because the results contradict the IPCC.
Svensmark investigated the mechanism of how cosmic rays impact the creation of climate-crucial clouds. This happens through creation of ions which serve as clouding seeds in the atmosphere:

Image: EIKE
By experiments and by correlation measurements, Svensmark investigated the mechanism of cloud creation by cosmic rays. IPCC researchers already cite a reduction of cloud creation as a possible positive feedback mechanism, which could escalate global warming to catastrophic levels, and so Svensmark’s research needs to be addressed seriously.
The importance of cloud creation as a cooling climate factor is regarded as undisputed, Svensmark’s conclusion:

Image: EIKE 
Scientific summary
Overall, as a physicist, I found the 4 ground-breaking scientists presented results that make it seem highly improbable that the IPCC climate models are complete and reliable. The IPCC models are hardly worthy of any 97% consensus.

"The world’s readiness for the inevitable effects of the climate crisis is “gravely insufficient”, according to a report from global leaders. This lack of preparedness will result in poverty, water shortages and levels of migration soaring, with an “irrefutable toll on human life”, the report warns.  Trillion-dollar investment is needed to avert “climate apartheid”, where the rich escape the effects and the poor do not, but this investment is far smaller than the eventual cost of doing nothing. The study says the greatest obstacle is not money but a lack of “political leadership that shakes people out of their collective slumber”. A “revolution” is needed in how the dangers of global heating are understood and planned for, and solutions are funded. Greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels, forest destruction and other human activities are trapping heat and putting more energy into the climate system.  Hotter air means heatwaves are much more likely. For example, scientists now say the unprecedented heat and wildfires across the northern hemisphere in 2018 “could not have occurred without human-induced climate change”. In Australia, the scorching summer of 2016-17 in New South Wales was made at least 50 times more likely by global heating, linking it directly to climate change. Hotter air can also carry more water vapour, meaning more intense rain and more flooding.  Another important factor in the northern hemisphere is the impact of changes in the Arctic. The polar region is heating more rapidly, reducing the temperature difference with lower latitudes. There is strong evidence that this is weakening the planetary waves (including the jet stream) that normally meander over Europe, Asia and North America. When these waves stall, weather gets fixed over regions and becomes extreme. This has been linked to past floods in Pakistan, heatwaves in Russia and drought in California.  Most of the planet’s trapped heat goes into the oceans and rising sea temperatures mean more energy for hurricanes and typhoons. Record-breaking cyclones hit Mozambique last year. The deluge delivered in the US by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 was made three times more likely by climate change. Rising sea level also means storms cause more coastal damage. Natural variability would cause some extreme weather, even without global heating, but our impacts on the climate make such extremes more likely. Carbon Brief analysed more than 230 studies and found 95% of heatwaves were made more likely or worse by climate change. For droughts, 65% were definitely affected by our hotter world, while the figure for floods was 57%. With the ‘rapidly accelerating’ likelihood of 40C temperatures in UK, it is now undeniable that global heating is causing more extreme weather. The report has been produced by the Global Commission on Adaptation (GCA), convened by 18 nations including the UK. It has contributions from the former UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon, the Microsoft founder, Bill Gates, environment ministers from China, India and Canada, the heads of the World Bank and the UN climate and environment divisions, and others. Among the most urgent actions recommended are early-warning systems of impending disasters, developing crops that can withstand droughts and restoring mangrove swamps to protect coastlines, while other measures include painting roofs of homes white to reduce heatwave temperatures. In the foreword to the report, Ban, Gates and Kristalina Georgieva, the World Bank chief executive, write: “The climate crisis is here, now: massive wildfires ravage fragile habitats, city taps run dry, droughts scorch the land and massive floods destroy people’s homes and livelihoods. So far the response has been gravely insufficient.” Ban said: “I am really concerned about the lack of vision of political leaders. They are much more interested in getting elected and re-elected, and climate issues are not in their priorities. We are seeing this in the US with President Trump.” The report says severe effects are now inevitable and estimates that unless precautions are taken, 100 million more people could be driven into poverty by 2030. It says the number of people short of water each year will jump by 1.4 billion to 5 billion, causing unprecedented competition for water, fuelling conflict and migration. On the coasts, rising sea levels and storms will drive hundreds of millions from their homes, with costs of $1tn (£810bn) a year by 2050. Patrick Verkooijen, the chief executive of the Global Center on Adaptation, said: “What we truly see is the risk of a climate apartheid, where the wealthy pay to escape and the rest are left to suffer. That is a very profound moral injustice.” But the moral imperative alone will not drive change, he said, and the report also makes an economic case. “It is a nation’s self-interest to invest in adaptation,” Verkooijen said. The report estimates spending $1.8tn by 2030 in five key areas could yield $7.1tn in net benefits, by avoiding damages and increasing economic growth. The chair of the UK’s Environment Agency, Emma Howard Boyd, is a member of the GCA. The agency has warned England could run short of water within 25 years and increased coastal and river flooding may force some towns to be abandoned. In July, the UK government’s official advisers said they were shocked at the lack of proper plans to protect people from the effects of the climate crisis. Bob Ward, the policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics, said: “As one of the governments that commissioned this important GCA report, the UK must heed its conclusions about the large economic benefits from adapting to those impacts of climate change that cannot now be avoided. “This summer has shown that the UK is not adapted to the changing climate of this century, with heavier rainfall and more frequent and intense heatwaves. Successive environment ministers have failed to give this issue the attention it needs, leading to greater damage to lives and livelihoods.” Cutting carbon emissions is vital, says the GCA report, but this has received nearly 20 times more funding than adaptation in recent years. Climate effects must be factored into decisions by those who make choices about the future, it says, such as business leaders. Verkooijen said nations should follow France in making it compulsory for large companies to report the climate risks to their businesses. The GCA report focuses on several areas of adaptation: Early warning systems: Just 24 hours’ warning of a coming storm or heatwave can cut the ensuing damage by 30%, saving lives and protecting assets worth at least 10 times the cost of the alert system. In Bangladesh, such systems, plus shelters and coastal protection, have already saved hundreds of thousands of lives since the Bhola cyclone in 1970 killed at least 300,000 people. Climate-ready infrastructure: Such measures can add 3% to the upfront costs but save $4 for every $1 spent. Flood protection is key and Shanghai, and other Chinese “sponge cities” are deploying porous pavements, rooftop gardens and trees in parks to soak up water from downpours. Relatively simple measures can also be effective, such as painting roofs with reflective white paint. In the Indian city of Ahmedabad, this has cut temperatures in the rooms below by 5C. Mangrove protection: These coastal forests buffer storms, protecting 18 million people and preventing $80bn a year in flood damage. They also provide nurseries for fish and tourist attractions worth billions. But construction, pollution and global heating have destroyed many mangrove forests, from Australia to Mexico. The GCA says the benefits of mangrove preservation and restoration are up to 10 times the cost."
"As Erica Roberts clung to a tall mango tree, the winds and sea water churned up by Hurricane Dorian pounding her face, a single thought ran through her head: “I will not die like this.” Her home, in the small town of High Rock on the eastern side of Grand Bahama, had been swept away. Her 24-year-old daughter Natori survived too, clinging to branches beside her. Roberts’ face and arms still bore dry, bloody cuts. The pair eventually lost their grip, she said, but they were swept close to a home that still stood. They got inside. “By the grace of God, we made it,” she said. “We are survivors.” The 41-year-old had not heard from seven close family members: two sons, a sister, two nephews, cousins, uncles. All were still missing. In a community of about 600, two were confirmed dead. At least 20 had not been heard from since Dorian spent two days destroying almost every building in sight. “We need aid,” Roberts said. “We have nothing. Everyone is doing this self-sufficiently.” The hurricane’s devastating 185mph winds brought destruction to Grand Bahama and the Abaco Islands and left at least 43 people dead – a toll that is sure to rise as emergency crews search for survivors. Parts of the road just outside town had been stripped of tarmac, leaving rubble, exposed pipework and pools of bronzed water where trapped fish still swam. Broken pylons dangled in the street. Palms were bent at 45 degrees, leaves shaved off by the wind. The storm surge here, about half a mile from the sea, rose to around 20ft. Wind gusts were recorded at 220mph. Many who have lived here for generations said the brutality of the storm was something they had never seen or even heard of before. For Roberts, who works at a nearby casino – also obliterated – the unprecedented intensity of Dorian, the way it strengthened so quickly to category 5 and stood over the island for more than 24 hours, had a simple explanation. “I think the climate is playing a big role in all of this,” she said, starring at the muddy tiled floor of a partially destroyed home in which she had taken shelter. “The severity of this … it’s global warming. “I’ve recycled all my life. I use less plastic. And think about less emissions. I’ve always been committed. But the world is not.” As residents of High Rock began to assess the damage, the global climate crisis was on the minds of many. Euridice Kemp, a 40-year-old resident of Freeport, had returned to help salvage what she could from her grandparents’ home. All that was left of the building were the concrete foundations. Belongings – crockery, family photos, clothes, wooden furniture – were strewn on the muddy grass. She pointed to the horizon where six coconut trees once stood, where she played as a child. “It’s all gone. What we’re doing to Mother Earth and the way this turns around on areas like here … I just can’t. Never … never in my life. My heart is broken. I’m in shock.” Did she consider herself a victim of the climate crisis? “We are the biggest victims of climate change. But how can we fight for ourselves against bigger, global countries? How do we move forward?” At the shoreline, the sea still churned. A lighthouse was partially destroyed, its light blown away, leaving only a red-and-white striped tower. Pastor Joey Saunders, 61, was counting his blessings. The storm surge crept up to the roof of his house. He spent two days clinging to the branches of a tree, waiting for the water to recede, terrified that sharks might lurk below. The wind lashed him so hard, he began to feel numb. “I couldn’t feel anything any more,” he said. “I was just so afraid.” Limited aid has recently arrived in Grand Bahama and the Abaco Islands – with officials battling flooding and poor weather conditions for days. On Grand Abaco, the Royal Bahamas Defense force assisted around 160 evacuees to leave the island via ferry. The British navy is also assisting aid operations in the region and private vessels have begun to arrive as well. The Royal Caribbean cruise liner Symphony of the Seas arrived in Grand Bahama on Friday morning bringing with it 10,000 meals the company has provided itself. The food will be distributed by local NGOs and the Bahamian government. The United Nations has announced the purchase of eight tons in ready to eat meals and is aiming to provide other assistance including satellite communications and generators. The UN has said since Wednesday that around 70,000 people in the northern archipelagos of the Bahamas are in need of life-saving assistance."
"Queensland’s former fire commissioner says an erratic bushfire front that climbed into the state’s subtropical rainforest and razed the 86-year-old Binna Burra Lodge is “like nothing we’ve ever seen before”. “What we’re seeing, it’s just not within people’s imagination,” said Lee Johnson, who spent 12 years in charge of Queensland’s fire service. “They just didn’t believe it could ever get so bad.” Queensland remains in the grip of one of the worst bushfire threats in its history, fuelled by prolonged dry conditions and fierce gusting winds; an “omen” of a potentially devastating fire season ahead. There are still 52 fires burning across the state. Schools are closed and about 20 structures have been destroyed. Early on Sunday morning, a fire front climbed into the Lamington national park and razed Binna Burra, a historic eco-tourism lodge built in the 1930s and surrounded by subtropical Gondwana rainforest. The heritage-listed main lodge was built in 1933. It has never before been seriously threatened by bushfire, protected in part by lush and damp surroundings that typically suppress the progress of dangerous fires. “There have certainly been fires in the area before,” said the lodge chairman, Steve Noakes. “Back in the traditional owners’ time there’s evidence of fires, but certainly in the period of European history in this part of Australia, this is the most catastrophic. “There’s nothing left to burn at Binna Burra, it’s all gone.” Last year, Queensland experienced “unprecedented” fire conditions in November – a combination of hot, dry and windy days in tropical and subtropical parts of the state. A year later, and again conditions are being described in similar terms, the sort that can fuel catastrophic wildfires. Southeast Queensland has been particularly dry; the fire-threatened town of Stanthorpe is almost out of drinking water. In Lamington national park, the rainforest has had very little recent rain. Johnson, who is now a director of the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre, said in those sorts of extremely dry conditions the forest terrain became a potential tinderbox. “We’ve had a very long history of concern about that area, but we definitely have not seen fire conditions like this,” Johnston said. “Their terrain is very similar to parts of southern New South Wales and Victoria where bushfires are the norm. In Queensland the potential is there. That country at Lamington national park in particular, the topography is just cruel. “The weather conditions they’re now facing are just unheard of. The thing about fire, the bush in those conditions, is you can’t actually fight it. The heat generated means you can’t put people or equipment in front of this fires, you just can’t do it.” Part of the attraction of a place like Binna Burra Lodge is the isolation. There is one narrow access road. About 3am on Sunday morning, concern about the welfare of firefighters forced a retreat. All anyone could do was wait, while the fire front moved through. “We can’t access the site, it will be cut off for some days because of the rock slides and the tree fall,” Noakes said. “A couple of the emergency services workers hiked in yesterday, they were very brave, but it’s basically a write-off.” Noakes said the situation was “a signal to us that we need to take a more proactive approach to climate change”. “We need to know more about the impact of climate change on subtropical rainforests of Australia and what that means in terms of long-term infrastructure. That’s why people come to Queensland, to experience these places.” He said Binna Burra would be rebuilt in a way that took into account the likely impacts of climate change. “Binna Burra is 86 years old. When we position and design and build and operate tourism infrastructure in these sorts of natural environments, we have to think about 50 or 100 years ahead and what changes climate impacts are going to have on the built infrastructure. “Our responsibility now is to have a vision that is crafted of the knowledge and the understanding of the climate as it will impact on the tropical and subtropical rainforest.”"
"Arnold Schwarznegger has condemned Donald Trump over his unprecedented rollback of environmental protections, particularly his move against California’s regulation of automobile emissions.  “It’s wrong,” the Terminator star and two-term governor wrote in an opinion column for the Washington Post that was pointedly headlined: “Trump can’t erase a decade of clean-air progress with a Sharpie.” That was a reference to the furore over Trump’s display in the Oval Office last week of a hurricane map apparently altered with a Sharpie, or marker pen, to make a forecast for Hurricane Dorian show it potentially hitting Alabama. “It’s un-American,” Schwarzenegger said. “And it’s an affront to longstanding conservative principles.” Schwarzenegger said the Trump administration was “hellbent on reversing decades of history and progress”. “Whether it is [motivated by] political pettiness, shortsightedness or just plain jealousy, I couldn’t tell you,” he said. Describing his anger at moves against California over automobile emissions, Schwarzenegger said his state had been a leader in establishing clean-air standards since 1967, when his “hero”, Ronald Reagan, was governor. Schwarzenegger wrote: “We set our standards, and the federal government didn’t just respect our authority, it generally made our rules the standard for the entire nation.” The same pattern applied to efforts to curb greenhouse gases, he said. “The Trump administration’s threat to revoke our waiver to clean our air is more extreme,” Schwarzenegger wrote. “And coming from a Republican White House, it’s downright hypocritical.” The former governor also pointed to a contradiction between the conservative principle of states’ rights and the behaviour of the Trump administration. “How many times have you heard conservatives beat the drum of states’ rights?” he asked. “But suddenly, when a state wants to pollute less and protect its citizens from deadly pollution, conservatives throw states’ rights straight out the window.” California’s economic success, he said, was built on long-term planning. In contrast, the administration’s “knee-jerk reactionary policies such as the move to revoke our clean-air waiver create uncertainty”. “They didn’t ask for the Trump administration’s backward thinking, and they know it won’t help them,” he said of four big car companies that have worked with California on limiting emissions. He added: “California will fight this decision. And I promise you, we will win.”"

“Surface melting on Antarctic Peninsula ice shelves can influence ice shelf mass balance, and consequently sea level rise. We show that summertime cloud phase on the Larsen C ice shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula strongly influences the amount of radiation received at the surface and can determine whether or not melting occurs.”
2. Lee et al., 2020
“Clouds are one of the most important factors determining the radiation budget. In other words, all surface solar irradiances (SSI), atmospheric absorptions (AA), and reflection irradiances (RI) at TOA can be different according to the presence of clouds in the atmosphere…. Clouds in all- (or overcast-) sky atmosphere diminish surface solar irradiances (SSI) from 218.1 Wm−2 to 156.9 Wm−2 (or 85.8 Wm−2) and enhance atmospheric absorptions (AA) from 61.5 Wm−2 to 86.3 Wm−2 (or 128.2 Wm−2). Clouds also enhance the reflected irradiances (RI) at the TOA from 65.6 Wm−2 to 102.0 Wm−2 (or 131.2 Wm−2) for all- (or overcast-) skies. As a result, the all- (or overcast-) sky shortwave (SW) cloud forcing (CF) is −61.2 Wm−2 (or −132.3 Wm−2) at the surface, AA is 24.8 Wm−2 (or 66.7 Wm−2) in the atmosphere and RI is 36.4 Wm−2 (or 65.6 Wm−2) at the TOA, respectively.”

“Cloud radiative effects (CREs) are known to play a central role in governing the long-term mean distribution of sea-surface temperatures (SSTs). Very recent work suggests that CREs may also play a role in governing the variability of SSTs in the context of the El Niño/Southern Oscillation.”

“Clouds crucially regulate atmospheric energy balance, water circulation, and Earth’s climate system with multiple spatiotemporal scales (Boucher et al. 2013). Fundamental conundrums on clouds, the coupling of clouds with atmospheric circulation, and climate interactions have remained unsolved and have been identified as considerable challenges in climate research (Bony et al. 2015). One of the largest uncertainties amongst these challenges is the vertical property of clouds and their radiative effects (Li et al. 2015). Vertical variation of clouds can affect the vertical distribution of atmospheric radiative heating, surface energy balance, and general circulation by changing the vertical structure of radiative warming and cooling rates (Johansson et al. 2015; Pan et al. 2017). Quantifying the vertical distribution of cloud radiative forcing and their impacts on atmospheric circulation and regional climate has become critical.”
5. Yin and Porporato, 2020
“Toward this goal, here we analyze the radiation at the top of the atmosphere and propose a measure of the DCC [diurnal cloud cycle] radiative effect (DCCRE) as the difference between the total radiative fluxes with the full cloud cycle and its uniformly distributed cloud counterpart. When applied to the frequency of cloud occurrence, DCCRE is linked to the covariance between DCC and cloud radiative effects. Satellite observations show that the daily cloud cycle is strongly linked to pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) and climate hiatus, revealing its potential role in controlling climate variability.”
6. Delgado-Bonal et al, 2020
“Our research supports the idea that clouds and albedo, which ultimately determine the SW radiation, are variables of the utmost importance for current climate change, in agreement with previous research about the changes in stratocumulus or energy imbalance in the last four decades for example. An increase in cloud coverage of 0.1 would, on average, lead to a 7% increase in spectrally integrated global average reflectance of shortwave radiation.”
“When reaching the Earth, part of the incoming solar radiation is reflected off clouds and the surface as shortwave radiation (SW). Changes in cloud distribution or the surface albedo affect this flux and change the energy balance. In the last four decades, changes in cloud distribution in low-level clouds such as subtropical stratocumulus have been of great importance since they have the ability to reflect large amounts of radiation back to space but do not reduce significantly the outgoing terrestrial radiation. … [S]hortwave radiation is the main driver in the dynamics and plays a major role in the energy balance by affecting the longwave radiation field.”
 “The existence of reflective surfaces such as clouds or the ground determines directly the amount of SW radiation and, thus, the available energy for being absorbed and reemitted as LW. … A plausible hypothesis to explain the changes in SW radiation is that cloud amount and properties have changed in the last decades.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Trump-bashing German mainstream media are already going into deep depression over the 2020 US election. An ARD public television commentary by Washington correspondent Sebastian Hesse admits things are looking really dire for the US Democrats, and is now even seeing “a landslide victory for Trump”.

German ARD news media somber over Trump’s 2020 election chances. Image ARD tagesthemen
Forget the media in US . They lack the bird’s eye view and are deep in denial with the situation being so bleak for the Democrats.
Seeing a “landslide victory”
But in Europe the news media are beginning to see it. A commentary by Washington ARD correspondent Sebastian Hesse at ARD public television – Germany’s version of the BBC – openly comments: “Trump’s re-election is likely,” adding: “If next week were elected, who would win the race? Forecast: a landslide victory for Donald Trump.”
Will take a miracle
While the Democrats and Republicans begin to rumble in the political kick boxing ring in the lead-up to next year’s 2020 Presidential election, the vastly Trump-hating European media are watching with a view from their seats in the bleachers. And they’re in disbelief at what they are seeing.
They see a Democrat party that’s already battered, bleeding – with eyes puffed shut  – tired and about to go down for the count. Their only hope is a Hail Mary, a miraculously lucky punch landing.
It wasn’t supposed to be that way. Two and half years ago the snotty German media were all predicting enfant terrible Donald Trump would be a one-term president, if even that. What happened?
“Trump has delivered”

According to the ARD’s Hesse: “Trump has delivered.” He “has mobilized the conservatives by appointing conservative judges and “especially on issues that are close to America’s traditionalists’ hearts: Abortion, immigration, possession of weapons. […] Only George Washington had brought more new judges.”
“Unprecedented consistency”
Trump has also fought for building the wall on the border, doing away with paralyzing environmental legislation and patriotism at every opportunity “with unprecedented consistency”, Hesse sniffs.
The ARD correspondent adds: “The non-partisan floating voters who have made their mark on Trump may find him alienating or even repulsive as a person. But they make their choice soberly according to the simple formula: Am I feeling better today than four years ago?”
“Jobs, jobs, jobs”
Hesse also concedes “the economy has been buzzing since Trump took office” and the US has seen “growth rates like nowhere else in Europe, the stock market boom and above all jobs, jobs, jobs.”… “For the time being, many Americans feel that they are doing well under Trump.”
Opponents “are all in trouble”
Hesse currently sees Trump’s most promising opponents “are all in trouble”:” Joe Biden, because the Ukraine affair is also going home with him. Elizabeth Warren, because her agenda is also too left for many democrats. And Bernie Sanders, who already suffered a heart attack in the pre-election campaign.”
Forget impeachment
But what about the impeachment? German leaders and media are hoping that perhaps the impeachment process will stzop Trump. Here Hesse notes soberly: “Well, there is not even an impeachment procedure yet. And if there is one, it will most likely fail because of the Republican majority in the Senate”.
Hesse summarizes: “The bottom line is that only three developments could bring down Trump: outrageous revelations in the wake of the impeachment investigation. A noticeable economic downturn. And the most improbable: a convincing challenger, to whom the hearts and votes will fly to. All three are not in sight. The man in the White House doesn’t need to think about packing his suitcase!”

Share this...FacebookTwitterUsing NASA’s MERRA-2 radiation data, scientists find shortwave radiation (SW) has been rising since the 1980s. The SW increase has been larger and faster than longwave radiation (LW) changes during this same timespan. Cloud variability has been the “main driver” of these trends.

Image Source: Delgado-Bonal et al, 2020
In a new Nature journal paper (Delgado-Bonal et al, 2020) published in Scientific Reports, scientists use radiation records from NASA to conclude shortwave (SW) changes are “mainly determined” by cloud modulation.
Clouds are “showing a declining trend” from 1984-2014. Fewer clouds means less SW radiation is reflected to space and more is absorbed by the Earth’s surface.
Figures 1 (SW) and 2 (LW) suggest post-1980 radiative forcing trend lines reach ~3.5 W/m² (rising from approximately 103.5 to 107 W/m²) and slightly less than 1 W/m² (approximately 237.5 to 238.3 W/m²) for SW and LW, respectively.

Image Source: Delgado-Bonal et al, 2020
Therefore, because (a) the SW radiation trend has been more pronounced than the LW radiation changes, and (b) the cloud variability is the main driver of SW radiation (that is of “great importance to recent climate change”), the recent positive energy imbalance – and warming – can mainly be attributed to cloud modulation.
The “argued” dominance of a human and/or LW (greenhouse effect) domination in recent climate change therefore becomes a question that is “still open”.

Delgado-Bonal et al, 2020
“When reaching the Earth, part of the incoming solar radiation is reflected off clouds and the surface as shortwave radiation (SW). Changes in cloud distribution or the surface albedo affect this flux and change the energy balance. In the last four decades, changes in cloud distribution in low-level clouds such as subtropical stratocumulus have been of great importance since they have the ability to reflect large amounts of radiation back to space but do not reduce significantly the outgoing terrestrial radiation.”
“[S]hortwave radiation is the main driver in the dynamics and plays a major role in the energy balance by affecting the longwave radiation field”
“[C]hanges in cloud fraction for example would be rapidly manifested in the shortwave field and would influence the longwave radiation field since the available energy for being absorbed would be different.”
“The existence of reflective surfaces such as clouds or the ground determines directly the amount of SW radiation and, thus, the available energy for being absorbed and reemitted as LW.”
“Our research supports the idea that clouds and albedo, which ultimately determine the SW radiation, are variables of the utmost importance for current climate change, in agreement with previous research about the changes in stratocumulus or energy imbalance in the last four decades for example.

"Farming can become climate neutral by 2040 without cutting beef production or converting substantial areas of farmland into forest, according to a plan published by the National Farmers’ Union. Instead, the NFU says three-quarters of the UK’s agricultural emissions can be offset by growing fuel for power stations and then capturing and burying the carbon dioxide, which could lead to energy plants becoming the nation’s biggest crop after wheat. Increasing the carbon stored in soils and using technology to reduce the emissions caused by cattle and fertiliser use are also needed, the NFU says. Agriculture causes about 10% of the UK’s climate-heating emissions; of these agricultural emissions 90% is methane from livestock and nitrous oxide from fields. The UK is committed to ending net emissions by 2050, but sectors such as farming and aviation are the biggest challenges. Minette Batters, the president of the NFU, said making the sector climate neutral would be tough but an ambitious plan was necessary or society would not forgive farmers. She said farmers understood better than most that climate change was the biggest challenge of our time. “We are seeing far more extreme weather events and we are impacted more than anyone else because our offices are outside,” she said. “Last year was a frightening year on our farm. Our spring barley died in front of us” because of a lack of water. A series of recent scientific studies have concluded that consumers in rich nations need to drastically cut red meat consumption in order to tackle the climate crisis and destruction of wildlife. But the NFU argues that UK beef production does not rely on high-intensity farming or turning forests into pasture, and is only 40% as emission-intensive as the global beef production average. “We don’t plan to make any cuts,” Batters said. “We think we can do it without changing levels of production.” People are increasingly choosing to eat less meat and Batters said: “Everybody’s diet is up to individuals to choose, but there are other parts of the world that are hungry for high-quality meat.” The NFU plan envisages half of farming’s emissions being offset by growing willow, miscanthus grass and other energy crops to use in bioenergy with carbon capture and storage power plants. The technology is only at the pilot stage but the scale required by the NFU plan is consistent with projections for 2050 from the Committee on Climate Change, the government’s official advisers. The NFU plans also call for a doubling of wind, solar and biomethane energy on farms. Storing more carbon in soils, peatlands, woodlands and hedgerows offsets another fifth of agricultural emissions. Only 1.5% of the total comes from new tree planting – less than the CCC has recommended – but the NFU sees its figure as the maximum realistically possible. A quarter of farming’s emissions can be cut by raising animals and growing crops more efficiently, according to the NFU. Its plans highlight feed additives to cut methane in animals, gene editing to improve crops and livestock, and controlled-release fertilisers. “It is very welcome that the NFU is setting ambitious targets,” said Sue Pritchard, the director of the RSA’s food, farming and countryside commission, which concluded in July that farming must be radically transformed within 10 years to end environmental destruction. “Many farmers are already doing what they can – the growth of the pasture fed livestock movement is a case in point.” The Friends of the Earth campaigner Guy Shrubsole said: “Eating less but better meat is a crucial part of the fight against climate breakdown, yet astonishingly there is no mention of this in the NFU’s report. Doing so would free up much more land for trees and agroforestry, which would absorb huge quantities of carbon from the atmosphere. “It seems the NFU is still not prepared to contemplate significant land use change in Britain, despite the CCC recommending this as being vital,” he said, noting that some progressive farmers are starting to pioneer a new approach to managing the land. Some environmental groups have called for a quarter of the UK to be returned to nature through rewilding to tackle the climate crisis and the loss of wildlife. Batters said: “All farms have wild areas on them. It shouldn’t be a binary debate of rewilding versus production.” Farmers are extremely worried about a possible no-deal Brexit and the UK being flooded with cheap, lower-standard food, and Batters said achieving climate neutrality would be extremely hard in that scenario. The NFU report does not assess whether payments to farms – currently £3bn a year under the EU subsidy regime – would need to rise or fall in order to make agriculture climate neutral. Batters said it was vital for the government to introduce the right policies so farmers were given incentives to deal with emissions, and have long-term funding in place."

Share this...FacebookTwitterA newly released paper by Kumar et al looks at the changes and prediction of the Amery Ice Shelf (AIS) of East Antarctica using remote sensing data.
The scientists found that the ice shelf is prograding (expanding), and not breaking apart like some alarmist scientists feared earlier.

Image: cropped from Wikipedia. 
Hat-tip: Mary Brown
Wikipedia tells that in December 2006, “enormous cracks” had been forming for over a decade at a rate of three to five metres a day – possibly due to global warming – but researchers later said it was too early to attribute the phenomenon to global warming because of the “possibility of a natural 50-60 year cycle being responsible”.
Now the recent paper by Kumar et al reports findings that the Amery Ice Shelf (AIS) is not disintegrating, let alone shrinking, but rather is advancing!

“Prograding considerably”
Once readers get past the scientific gobbledygook of the paper’s abstract, (possibly intended to obscure the paper’s inconvenient results) it becomes clear the ice shelf there is growing. “Amery Ice Shelf extent is prograding considerably in the last two decades.”
The scientists reconstructed the past and made a prediction of the future-ice shelf extent using linear regression techniques. They found that changes in the ice shelf extent “are linked with ocean-atmosphere interaction”. That means natural factors are dominantly at work, and not the anthropogenic ones.
The AIS changes were studied using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) satellite data of the austral summer months (January–March) from 2001–2016. Using statistical techniques, the rate changes of the AIS extent were estimated.
14.5 km increase
According to the paper’s abstract: “The study reveals that the AIS extent has been prograded at the rate of 994 m/year with an average 14.5 km increase in the areal extents during 2001–2016, as compared to the year 2001, whereas, the maximum advancement in ice shelf extent was recorded during the 2006–2016 period.”
The study also found that the eastern part of Mackenzie Bay to Ingrid Christensen coast also “recorded advancement in ice shelf extents and mass” and that this was in part linked to “a decrease in the temperatures (air temperature and sea surface temperature).

Leaders are now labelling their own citizens “ecological vandals”, and openly demanding they be brought under tight control by a China-modelled system. The building blocks for a tyranny are in place. 
Lately the thinly veiled calls for watering down western democracy have been becoming increasingly clear and unmistakable.
All the cornerstones for a green tyranny are emerging in Europe: 1) a claimed climate crisis that is 2) attributable to reckless human behavior, 3) it is urgent and 4) thus justifies strict regulation of human behavior, and all accompanied by 5) actions to silence dissident views.
Consumers criminalized, being labelled “ecological vandals”
Blaming humans for the ” climate crisis” is already well underway across Europe.
Recently the online Die Welt reported on a DPA interview of Green Party mastermind Nico Paech, who in the interview called for “a radical change in the behavior of citizens.”
Economist Paech, a proponent of a “post-growth economy which calls for a move away from consumerism and further economic growth, told the DPA that a majority society “believes it is climate competent, but lives like ecological vandals.” In other words, free citizens are to be viewed as criminals.
What is needed, said Paech, was a “radical reorientation” in order to “drastically reduce the emission of greenhouse gases quickly” and that it was necessary to “clear out our lifestyles”. What is needed is an authoritarian government to take swift and harsh control, he suggests.

Meanwhile German Green Party leader Robert Habeck last year in an interview with Phoenix German public television told viewers that if a democracy is unable to keep pace with the pressing challenges, then “a centralized system, which is naturally faster” needs to be seriously considered.

Habeck cites China as an example on how to get things done when citizens get in the way. In China:

There is no opposition or participation by citizens. And if they make mistakes, they still cannot be elected out of office. Maybe there will be a revolt in China, but first of all the system is more efficient. Do we want that or not? The decision cannot be made economically. It can be made only based on values and, yes, I would say that’s what we want.”
EU declares climate state of emergency
And to lay the groundwork for implementing such radical authoritarian initiatives, it comes as no surprise that the EU just recently declared “a climate emergency” after a vote of 429 MEPs in favour and 225 against. “Europe became the first continent to make this declaration,” Euronews.com reported.
Note s state of emergency is defined as follows:
A situation in which a government is empowered to perform actions or impose policies that it would normally not be permitted to undertake. A government can declare such a state during a disaster, civil unrest, or armed conflict. Such declarations alert citizens to change their normal behavior and orders government agencies to implement emergency plans.”
So, there’s really not much left to keep the EU from grabbing a lot more power, except ardent protests. But here, too, EU leaders are at work.
Free speech has its limits
Listen to German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s speech on freedom of expression, where she says ” freedom of speech has its limits” and that “we have to take away your freedom of speech, or else society won’t be free.”
Surely everyone is against hate speech. But deciding what qualifies as hate speech should not be left to governments – especially those obsessed with a climate doomsday to the point that they now label climate science skeptics as “deniers” and hinder them from expressing dissent and participating in public debate.
Moreover, Big Social Media like Twitter, Google and Facebook are also busily working behind the scenes obstructing dissenters from getting their views out over a variety of issues. And they are under increasing pressure to clamp down even harder.
So the building blocks of a green tyranny are already in place in Europe: crisis, urgency, culprit, proposed system, suppression of speech.
Opportunity knocks
Right now, the EU is just waiting patiently for that one opportune moment. We are possibly witnessing a watershed historical event in the making.

"This year the UK experienced its hottest winter day, its hottest Easter, its hottest day on record. That peak of 38.7C came as England’s men played Ireland at Lord’s, when MCC members in the pavilion were allowed to remove their jackets for the second year in a row – surely a sign of doom to match the best of Jericho’s trumpets. All around the cricketing world the climate emergency has started to bite, affecting everyone from elite players in their air-conditioned hotels to the two billion fans who play and watch in some of the most climate-sensitive places on the planet. And yet – despite the cancellation of club and school cricket in South Africa in 2018 because of drought; the movement of IPL matches because of lack of water; extreme flooding in the UK; the suspension of play due to air pollution during a Test in Delhi, and hurricanes devastating the Caribbean – cricketers and cricket authorities have shown no great inclination to stand up and shout about this threat to the game. The gold medal Olympians Helen Glover and Etienne Stott, who was arrested in April at the Waterloo Bridge Extinction Rebellion protests, were among 19 sports stars who wrote a letter to the Guardian last month calling for sports to reduce their climate footprint and sportsmen and women to lead the fight. No cricketers signed the letter. Nor have the ICC or any member boards joined the UN Sports for Climate Action Framework – which has members as varied as the Rugby League World Cup 2021 and Bowls Australia. Alas, the difficult file marked climate crisis seemed destined to sit forever on the pending shelf, until perhaps now, with Tuesday’s publication of the Hit for Six report. This follows where the Game Changer report of February 2018 dipped its toes, drilling deep into the climate data – not only detailing the impacts already felt by cricket-playing countries and the likely problems to come, but also discussing the impact these environmental changes will have on individual cricketers, particularly in situations of extreme heat. Experiments at the University of Portsmouth revealed that the heat produced by an international batsman with what is essentially a series of shuttle sprints between the wickets is equivalent to running 8km an hour. That’s 8km an hour in full cricket kit – long-sleeved shirts and trousers, padding and a helmet – for what could be eight hours in the hot sun. When the air temperature becomes higher than the skin temperature, the only way the body can try to cool down is through sweating – which becomes difficult when the skin is covered with protective clothing. The body becomes unable to function properly and this can result in anything from heat cramps to the medical emergency that is heatstroke. Joe Root is a case in point, taken to hospital during the Sydney Test of 2018 after retiring hurt with a combination of dehydration and a gastro-intestinal bug after playing in temperatures that peaked at 43.7C. Understandable, when you consider that the ideal temperature for exercise in light clothing is 10-11C. The report also details psychological responses to heat, with increased body temperature interfering with the efficiency of the human brain. While simple tasks, flipping a coin at the toss, should remain invulnerable to heat stress, more complex decisions – the report suggests, “vigilance (the ability to maintain attention, for example, when batting), short-term/working memory (for example a bowler remembering how the ball bounced off the pitch) and dual tasks (for example, a batter keeping an eye on an incoming delivery while simultaneously manoeuvring to take a shot)” become much more difficult – which, as cat follows mouse, will result in a less skilful and less watchable game. These stresses will also affect umpires – who, if not so active, stand for hours and have to make split-second decisions with unwavering concentration. To date, only Cricket Australia have any sort of rules surrounding heat – last August they introduced Heat Stress Risk Index Management Interventions – which involve mitigations from increasing the number of drinks breaks to, ultimately, suspending play. As anyone who has desperately waited for the temperature to fall during the suffocating torpor of a sweltering afternoon knows, these will not be short sharp rain breaks. What next, then? The report comes up with a page of suggestions that cricket would do well to heed. These range from encouraging all countries to come up with their own heat rules, and kit manufacturers to make heat-resistant clothing and equipment, even suggesting that cricketers should experiment with shorts, to suggesting authorities test players’ abilities under heat stress and, controversially, extend the length of tours to help acclimatisation. It points out authorities have a duty of care to children, who are less able to regulate their body temperatures. It calls on cricket to bear in mind that in times of climate crisis, authorities will prioritise food and drinking water, not watering cricket pitches, and recommends the setting up of an ICC global climate disaster fund. Much, then, to think about – before cricket even gets on the existential question of how it marries the constant desire for expansion with responsibility for the planet. As Kevin Mitchell, the prime minister of Grenada, writes in the report’s forward: “Climate change is real. It’s as simple as that. Every ball bowled at us is currently a bouncer. We’re ducking so much we’re struggling to build an innings that will ensure a safe, secure and sustainable future for our people.” • This is an extract taken from the Spin, the Guardian’s weekly cricket email.

The last two summers in Germany (2018 and 2019) were unusually dry and warm, and already alarmists began to screaming that this was just a preview of what’s in store for Europe’s crispy burnt future.
The following 2 charts show the ground moisture for Germany last September. The left image depicts the ground moisture at the depth of 25 cm, and the image on the right for a depth of 1.8 meters:

German indeed was unusually dry last September. Source: The drought monitor; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ)
February 2020 second wettest since records began
But the precipitation pendulum has swung to the other side. The German DWD national weather service now reports that February 2020 was the second wettest since records began. Only 1946 was wetter. Last month some parts of Germany saw rainfall that was double of what is normal.


In some regions it was even the wettest February, e.g. in Lower Saxony, Hamburg and Schleswig Holstein. The reason was a series of lows from the Atlantic moving directly over Germany.

Ground in many areas now over-saturated
Now the ground is well soaked down to the middle and deeper layers. In some parts of  Lower Bavaria and parts of eastern Germany, however, there is still dryness in some places at a depth of just under 2 metres. Yet, the situation is expected to ease there as well.

Currently much of Germany is over-saturated for the 0-60 cm ground depth:

More precipitation ahead
Moreover the 14-day forecast for Germany sees more precipitation ahead, which will further saturate the ground. Last year at this time, in the wake of the dry 2018 summer, the ground was much drier. So this year ground moisture levels will be in much better shape as summer approaches.
So, all the doom and gloom scenarios of severe drought and crop failures being the future of Germany have suddenly been washed away. Alarmists will have to go elsewhere to chase climate ambulances.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt a strategy conference in Kassel last weekend, German leftist/environmentalist party Die Linke (The Leftists) discussed its plans for social change. Major German story here on this scandal.
The aim of the conference was to discuss how the leftist Die Linke could successfully intervene in fundamental social issues, “change the country for a social-ecological system change” and to protect the climate.
During a panel discussion, a Die Linke member woman in the front row, identified as Sandra L, took the floor. At the end of her ranting presentation, she felt it was important to emphasize that “a transition to renewable energies is also necessary after a revolution, and that after shooting the 1% rich people. we still want to heat.”

Some in attendance could be heard chuckling and applauding in response. But others could be heard murmuring in shock, and so Sandra L doubled down: “Well, it’s like this! We need to get off this meta-level.”
In attendance was also Die Linke leader Bernd Riexinger, who responded to the woman directly, saying: “I want to say,we don’t shoot them. We can use them for useful work!” For this he also received applause and laughter from the audience!
Just a misunderstanding, “taken out of context”

Soon the video of the incident was posted on Twitter and quickly went viral. German Twitter followers were aghast at the suggestion of shooting dead the 1% rich in the country. Before long the pressure mounted on party leader Riexinger to take back the comments, who shortly later claimed on Twitter that Sandra L’s comments were “completely taken out of context”.
“It was and is unacceptable. I regret that I did not immediately reject it unequivocally,” Riexinger commented.
“Abhor violence against people”
By evening, desperate to control the image damage to Die Linke, a party with about 10% of the vote in Germany, Sandra L was forced to tell the DPA German Press Agency: “I apologize for this statement, which I made in the excitement and thoughtlessness. It completely contradicts my political views, I abhor violence against people.”
“We need an active social and environmental energy policy. My statement did not serve this purpose,” she added.
Thuringia’s Minister President Bodo Ramelow (Die Linke) sharply denounced Sandra L’s comments on Twitter: “Anyone who wants to shoot people and rant about a revolution with or through violence has nothing in common with my set of values. The statement was unacceptable and should never have been passed over with a smile”.
It is unclear whether and which office Sandra L has in the extreme German Die Linke party.

"And the Bible said: “God did not spare the angels when they sinned” (2 Peter 2:9). Nor, it seems, did God spare Billie Eilish. The 17-year-old pop star’s unsettling new video finds her a fallen angel, ejected from Heaven and landing on Earth to find it a deserted, fiery hellscape. “Peter’s on vacation, an open invitation,” she sings, against jaunty keys, suggesting that “even God herself … will want the Devil on her team”.  Tarred and feathered, Eilish eventually goes up in flames herself as, in the background, silhouetted women dance sexily, like the singers she has deliberately positioned herself against. The video for the single all the good girls go to hell (the insistently nonchalant lower-case formatting is hers) has amassed 37m views in just five days, reflective of the controversy the clip has caused in corners of the internet. On the Q&A website Quora, a conflicted fan fretted: “Can I be a good Christian and like Billie Eilish’s new music?” On Twitter, a woman responded to Eilish’s share of the video, saying: “Prayers sent.” “Nobody asked for your prayers, Tina” came another fan’s retort. Pop stars playing with religious iconography is hardly a new idea: in March, Madonna marked the 30th anniversary of the Like a Prayer video, wherein she danced in front of burning crosses, kissed a black saint and caused so much controversy she claims it cost her a multi-million-dollar deal with Pepsi. More recently, Lady Gaga portrayed herself as Mary Magdalene in the video for Judas, released close to Holy Week and Easter 2011, though Gaga said it was not a purposeful attack on religion: “The only controversial thing about this video is that I’m wearing Christian Lacroix and Chanel in the same frame,” she joked to E!. In July, the SoundCloud rapper Lil Uzi Vert invoked the Rapture during his set at Wireless festival in London, telling his fans that they were “going to Hell” with him and that his hit XO Tour Llif3 was “what it’s going to sound like for eternity”.  Far from becoming immune to the shock tactics, however, some Christians seem to find Eilish’s embrace of Satanic imagery especially concerning in light of her tender years. To quote from the Everyday Christian Parent blog: “Satan no longer hides, and kids think its [sic] cool. … Contrary to Billie Eilish’s songs of hopelessness, we have hope in Jesus.” A closer reading of Eilish’s lyrics suggests the outrage is misplaced: hills are burning in California, sea levels are rising, the Pearly Gates are a picket fence – far from idolising the devil, Eilish has confirmed the song is largely about the threat from the climate crisis. “The world’s being ruined by us, you know – it’s literally us,” she said of the song in an interview. And all the good girls will find themselves in Hell along with the bad girls when it eventually comes to Earth. Those looking for hope after watching Eilish’s video on YouTube might have found it in the description, where she has posted a personal note urging fans to take part in the global climate strikes on 20 and 27 September. The top tag is #climatestrike. And so Eilish’s glory is revealed – praise be to Billie. Elle Hunt"
"Will Hutton hits the nail on the head (“The sheer scale of the crisis facing our decrepit constitution has been laid bare”, Comment). Our “constitution” is palpably broken and needs replacing. The key elements he wants in the new version are precisely those we have needed for a long time: federalism, an elected head of state and a fair voting system. While priority must be given to ensure that we do not crash out of the EU on 31 October, the need for a Speaker’s conference to draft a new constitution should be pretty high on the agenda. One is reminded of the Tennis Court Oath taken by the members of the French Third Estate in 1789 when they vowed not to dissolve until they had given their country a constitution. MPs would do well to swear something similar this week.Andrew McLuskeyAshford, Middlesex  Will Hutton is correct to say that Switzerland has elaborate rules for the conduct of referendums. Any citizen or organisation that collects a defined number of signatures can demand that a referendum be held. The exact wording is drawn up by civil servants and constitutional lawyers in discussions with the proposers to ensure that voters know precisely what they are being asked to agree to. It is even permitted to propose a motion to strike down legislation recently approved in parliament. This ingenious balance between direct democracy and representative democracy has the enormous benefit that legislation for significant change is couched in moderate terms for fear of subsequent rejection by the people. Under such a system, the Brexit vote wouldn’t even have reached the starting line.Karl GehringSheffield Nick Cohen says that the Brexit movement “has no purpose now other than to secure an empty victory” (Comment). It has been clear from the outset that the people behind Brexit have very clear intentions. The EU is a capitalist entity that not only rejects the worst aspects of the US system but has the clout to resist its encroachments. The disaster capitalists who want to discard laws designed to limit the ill effects of capitalism on employment, the environment, the climate, food, health etc and unleash an unrestricted race to the bottom will get even richer if Brexit goes through. This was always the purpose behind Brexit, whatever lies have been put up to hide it. These are not people who will be harmed by a no-deal Brexit; on the contrary, the potential to take advantage of it is almost unlimited.Jeremy CushingTaddyforde, Exeter My experience was similar to that of Sophie Hastings’s daughter (“Why my daughter said no to Oxbridge”, Focus). I grew up in a working-class family in Barrow-in-Furness and at sixth-form college, it was clear that I was expected to apply to Oxbridge.  When the vice-principal, a Cambridge alumnus, took several of us on a visit it seemed a stuffy place to a young man from such a different environment. The trip did a good job of deterring me, but there was still pressure from staff at my college. So I applied to Oxford, did well in the exam, was successful at interview and was made an offer of 2 grade Es. After I rejected Oxford, selecting Warwick, Oxford told my college that it wasn’t too late for me to change my mind and I was called to a meeting with the vice-principal. I remained adamant. When the A-level results came out, the local newspaper had photos of the highest achieving students. Mine was captioned: “Damian Rogan: turned down place at Oxford.”Damian RoganLondon, E16 Peter Beaumont (“WWII: eighty years on, the world is still haunted by a catastrophe foretold”, Comment) blames the allied governments, most notably the British and the American ones, for failing to offer relief to the persecuted Jews of Europe, despite the unequivocal evidence of the horrors taking place. He relates the resistance offered by authorities on both sides of the Atlantic, for a variety of reasons, to the very idea of offering sanctuary to the threatened Jews. No doubt this resistance played its part, but surely the crux of the inaction lay in Anthony Eden’s statement to parliament after Ed Morrow’s radio broadcast in 1942: the “immense geographical and other difficulties in the matter”. Bombing of the camps and railways may have been considered impractical (although that might have seriously disrupted the mechanised killing), but the options for Jews already locked inside a Nazi-occupied Europe were virtually non-existent. Some in southern France may have been able to escape into neutral Spain or Portugal, and from there to the US or Britain, but the vast majority would have had no chance of reaching friendly shores, especially the millions trapped inside Poland or the Soviet Union.  Even if there had been more political will to do something to prevent further slaughter of the Jews, in practice there was very little that could be done before the camps were overrun towards the end of the war and it is unfair to the wartime allied leaders to suggest that they could have prevented the Holocaust.Melvin HurstVentnor, Isle of Wight It is disappointing to see that prominent cultural figures Grayson Perry and Olivia Colman, who, one would hope, would put their popularity to good use as beneficial social influencers, are instead encouraging the perpetuation of environmentally damaging behaviour (“Strikes, IT failures, customer unrest: can BA pull out of this nosedive?”, Business). At a time when we must transform our way of life, including a significant reduction in flying, in order to avoid the worst effects of global heating, I hope they will both recognise their mistake and find a way to make amends.Teresa BeltonNorwich Fast fashion is not qualitatively different to most other consumer industries in its impact upon the environment (“Can fashion keep its cool?”, Special Report). Consumer goods in general are too cheap, leading to over-consumption and waste, while things that improve the quality of our lives are too expensive (decent housing) or increasingly unavailable (public services). We need higher taxes on most goods (as well as on high incomes and wealth) to fund housebuilding, green public transport and other public expenditure.Richard MountfordTonbridge, Kent The MSC Gülsün’s containers (“The shifting patterns of English: Measurements that are meaningless”, Comment), being stacked outside the hull, are built of steel to withstand the onslaught of waves, the weather and the ship’s pitching and rolling during a long ocean voyage. Today, most containers being FEUs (40ft equivalent units), the Gülsün can carry up to 11,878 FEUs, each weighing 3.6 tons empty. That’s 42,000 tons of dead-weight steel, the equivalent of 5,701 old London Routemaster buses – over half the weight of the old Queen Mary – before a single banana is loaded. David GilesLondon W11"

It’s not surprising the biggest sinners are usually those first in line to cast stones. The killing of George Floyd reveals how there are so many among us who hypocritically fancy themselves as being morally superior when in fact they are morally bankrupt.
Sadly, black lives matter only when there are political dividends to be gained
When it comes to the centuries old racial problems and disparities, which we not only have seen in USA, but worldwide, there’s plenty of blame to go around. Yet we see so many righteously pointing the finger at everyone else but themselves.
Black Lives Matter, except…
Black lives of course definitely do matter, but in many cases it seems they really don’t. The next time you hear some pompous, leftist blowhard screaming to the USA: “Black Lives Matter!”, ask them why they always keep their eyes closed and barely lift a finger everywhere else. Examples:
Black Lives Matter,
…except the hundreds of African refugees who pompous Europeans let drown in the Mediterranean each year. Why no riots?
Black Lives Matter,
…except the millions who have been killed by Planned Parenthood abortion camps.
Black Lives Matter,
…except those who see their businesses destroyed by BLM rioters.
Black Lives Matter,
…except those who try to prevent looting.
Black Lives Matter,
…except the hundreds killed by other blacks each month, in places like Chicago.
Black Lives Matter,
…except the thousands who die from drugs trafficked in over porous borders.
Black Lives Matter,

Share this...FacebookTwitterLeading German climate science critic Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt has penned a commentary at Achgut.de titled: “How climate models inflate climate sensitivity.”

Image: GWPF
CO2 climate overblown
Vahrenholt cites Lewis/Curry 2018, who concluded “1.3°C for a doubling of the CO2 content of the atmosphere by about the end of this century (transient climate response), 1.7°C for a long-term equilibrium (ECS) in the period 2150 to 2200.
The German professor added: “Papers which examined historical periods (last glacial maximum to pre-industrial) do not contradict these low figures.”
Vahrenholt, co-author of The Neglected Sun, says that it’s been explained at his Die kalte Sonne site how “climate models are too hot” and that they do not fit with the observations”.
Overheated models a threat to movements
“If models and reality do not fit together, scientists should rather question their models,” says Vahrenholt. “This would mean that the much more dramatic sensitivity estimates of the last IPCC model observations – 1.86°C for TCR and 3°C for ECS – would have to be thrown overboard.” This of course would result in undermining the current Fridays for Future movement and plans by governments to tax CO2.

Activists currently blame the mismatch between models and observations on temporary “internal variability” events and that the warming will become “much stronger on a global scale in accordance to the models,” says Vahrenholt. But the IPCC’s and activists’ claims are being severely challenged by studies, such as Dong et al (2019), Vahrenholt comments.
Once again models fail
In Dong et al, which looks at the Tropical Pacific, it is shown how “once again the models fail because of the clouds!”
“It is therefore a clear physical mechanism that leads to the observed stronger warming of the tropical West Pacific leading to lower global sensitivities (= stronger negative global feedback),” the German professor of chemistry writes. “Climate models have such large deficits in the depiction of events in the tropical Pacific that they wrongly determine the global response to drivers and systematically overestimate the sensitivity to CO2 as a driver, a second paper by Seager et al of Columbia University in the respected scientific journal “Nature” (!) from July 2019 shows.”
“The failure of state-of-the-art models to capture the correct response introduces critical error into their projections of climate change,” Seager et al concluded.
But Germany’s leading climate science critic does not expect the IPCC to take all the errors into account when it puts out its forthcoming progress report. That would be a heck of a huge mess for the IPCC and an embarrassment to climate science and overzealous climate policymakers.
IPCC will go on pretending
“Then hundreds of pages dealing with model projections would have to be critically revised,” comments Vahrenholt. So for the IPCC, it’s best to just simply ignore all the inconvenient science and to go on pretending.
Vahrenholt concludes: “Politics is hot because the models are too hot. Which scientists have the courage and are ready to accept their responsibility to enlighten FFF and policymaking?”

Recently I tweeted that according to NASA GHCN V3 data, three of 4 stations in Iceland saw no warming from 1922 – 2018:

In Iceland, 3 of 4 stations have been a cooling or there has been no warming trend from 1922 to 2018, according to GHCN V3 Unadjusted data.GHCN V4 Unadjusted data shows how NASA changed the temperature data during the same period.#地球温暖化? #温暖化？ #気候変動 #ClimateChange pic.twitter.com/XjCe4KCqjg
— キリエ (@KiryeNet) April 1, 2020

But then NASA adjusted the V3 data and called it GHCN V4 “unadjusted”. The chart shown above in my tweet toggles between the prior V3 chart and the “unadjusted” V4. See the difference?
Note how the lack of warming has been removed and now the V4 data show modest warming. The missing heat was found – in the statistics! So in a sense, global warming has been “man-made” – done through statistical fudging and not human activity.
Greenland
Today we also take a look at Greenland. The map that follows shows the location of the stations we’ve been looking at:

Looking at Greenland V4 mean annual temperatures at the Nuuk and Tasiilaq stations, we see the following plots:

Here even NASA’s V4 data still show no warming. In fact we saw pronounced cooling from the 1960s to the early 1990s. Since 2002, Greenland temps have stabilized.
Recent findings confirm cooling
In fact a 2017 paper by Kabashi et al shows a downward trend “in accordance with a North Atlantic-wide cooling”:


Greenland’s glaciers stable

So no wonder Greenland’s glaciers have stopped appearing in alarmist headlines. After the brief 1990-2010 period of  melting, Greenland’s ice sheet mass losses have significantly decelerated since 2013 – a reversal from the rapid retreat from the 1990s to 2012 driven by cloud forcing and the NAO (Ruan et al., 2019).
The 47 largest Greenland glaciers also experienced a “relatively stable” period of rather insignificant retreat from 2013 to 2018 (Andersen et al., 2019).
Only 21 of the 47 Greenland glaciers retreated in 2018, 12 advanced, and the other 14 showed no trends in either direction (Polar Portal, 2019).
Greenland’s largest glacier, Jakobshavn, earned headlines in 2019 for its surprising and non-predicted rapid thickening in recent years.


Image Source: BBC, 2019

Share this...FacebookTwitterA German weekly “Die Zeit” commentary criticizes the hostility directed at skeptical climatologists and epidemiologists.
“Where do we end up if a scientist’s degree of alarm becomes a litmus test for his scientific respectability?” Science activism represents “relapse into pre-enlightened thinking”.

The false prophets
Over the recent years, we’ve seen a number of alarmist climate scientists demanding we believe that they are the beholders of the truth, and so policymakers need to heed their advice without question.
Science hubris
That hubris has gotten so dreadful that journalist Thea Dorn has since felt compelled to pen a commentary appearing in the centre-left Die Zeit: “Don’t preach, do research instead!”
Rather than arrogantly declaring that the science is settled, scientists shine through by remaining doubtful, Dorn writes.
She warns of climate scientists having become “ideologists” in the climate debate, and that this is threatening to happen in epidemiology/virology as well.
Not acceptable to defame doubters

“There is a world of difference between an irrational dogmatist and a reasonable skeptic, Thea Dorn writes. “It is not acceptable to immediately defame anyone who expresses doubts about the reliability of epidemiological or climate models as a ‘climate’ or ‘corona denier'”.
In Germany there have been a number of renowned virologists who have recently come under fire for dissenting against the alarmist claims made by other virologists.
Dorn writes: “In contrast to religion, modern science owes its success to its openness to doubt, criticism and self-correction.”
Rahmstorf suggestion “absurd”
Thea Dorn particularly fires harsh criticism at Prof. Stefan Rahmstorf, alarmist scientist at the Potsdam Institute, for suggesting in an essay in Spiegel in 2019 that mankind somehow had control over the “earth system” but was losing that control, an assumption that Dorn called “absurd and highly questionable”.
Dorn slams Rahmstorf and Prof. Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber for mischaracterizing the earth’s complexity as a mere set a dominoes on the verge of toppling, and claiming they have the models to predict the future, and they and the alarmist virologists and immunologists should be heeded.
Be thankful for skeptics
On the role of skeptics, Dorn writes: “On the contrary: we can be thankful that – still? – there are enough scientists who reject the magic of the crystal ball and the delusion of total controllability.”
Science crusaders
Dorn also sharply criticizes the concept of the “activist scientist”, which Hans Joachim Schellnhuber calls himself. She comments: “It represents a relapse into pre-enlightened thinking. With a slogan like “Unite behind the Science!” one might swear crusaders to a holy mission.”
Dorn summarizes:
One of the most tragic acts that a democracy can commit is self-submission to the rigid rules of a clerical natural science for fear of submission to the power of nature.”

"Since late last year, a group of workers within Amazon have been organizing to push the company to radically reduce its carbon emissions. Yesterday, they announced a major new action: on 20 September, Amazon workers around the world will walk out of their offices to join the Global Climate Strike. So far, more than 1,000 workers have pledged to participate. The organizers have three demands. They want the company to commit to zero emissions by 2030, to have zero custom cloud computing contracts with fossil fuel companies and to spend zero dollars on funding climate-denying lobbyists and politicians.  I spoke to one of the walkout’s organizers, a 28-year-old Amazon employee in Seattle named Rebecca Sheppard. We spoke about the origins of climate organizing within Amazon, the goals of the walkout and how the campaign connects to the wider tech worker movement. What do you do at Amazon? I’m a senior product manager for Amazon Air. I work out of the Seattle headquarters, and I’ve been here for nearly three years.  What is Amazon Air? In 2013, Amazon had an issue with third-party carriers getting packages to people’s homes in time for Christmas. So the company began building its own cargo airline, Amazon Air. We currently have 40 airplanes, and the plan is to expand to 70 by 2021. When I first started, I worked on optimization. If you utilize each aircraft fully, you don’t need to fly as many. But eventually I became frustrated, because no matter how efficiently you’re using the aircraft, the aircraft itself remains the same. It’s still burning fossil fuels. Planes today are still unsustainable even if you’re trying to use them as efficiently as possible. And sustainability is a very personal issue for me. How so? I grew up in Wilmington, North Carolina. It’s a coastal town so I’ve been watching hurricanes roll in my whole life. My very first driving lesson my dad had me drive through a hurricane. I grew up acutely aware of the climate crisis, because I watched the hurricanes in my hometown get worse. How did you decide to take action on climate within Amazon? Last year, I was feeling hopeless, unmotivated and frankly ashamed of the role I was playing at Amazon Air enabling carbon emissions. I have a beautiful three-year-old nephew, and I was afraid of what his world was going to look like in 50 years, given how much worse it had gotten in my 28 years. Then I heard about the shareholder resolution for Amazon to take climate action. In late 2018, a group of Amazon employees announced they would bring a resolution to the next shareholder meeting that would commit the company to develop a plan for transitioning off of fossil fuels. As employees, they had received equity in Amazon, so they had a right to submit a resolution as shareholders. This is the group that became Amazon Employees for Climate Justice (AECJ). When I heard about the resolution, I was inspired.  What was the response from management to the announcement of the resolution? AECJ members met with Amazon leadership in early 2019. At the first meeting, employees asked leadership when Amazon was going to publicly commit to reduce its emissions and share its carbon footprint. They said they had no plans to do either of those things. That’s when AECJ began drafting the first version of our open letter to Jeff Bezos. The week after leadership found out this letter was being circulated internally, Amazon announced Shipment Zero, our company’s first ever commitment to reduce shipping emissions. This was a total U-turn, and it was clearly done in response to our letter. The very next day, management asked AECJ to withdraw our shareholder resolution because of Shipment Zero. Shipment Zero commits Amazon to making 50% of its shipments net zero carbon by 2030. Shipment Zero only applies to the emissions associated with delivering packages, not with the many data centers run by Amazon Web Services (AWS). In the very same week that Amazon announced Shipment Zero, we learned from an investigative piece at Gizmodo that AWS is creating custom solutions and entering into custom contracts with oil and gas companies to use our cloud services to identify new fossil fuel reserves and to facilitate faster extraction. In other words, management told us they cared about the climate at the exact same time as they were doing deals with the fossil fuel industry. Because of this, we refused to withdraw the resolution. Instead, we updated our open letter to Bezos to include commentary on the oil and gas contracts, and urged him to take action on the issues outlined in the resolution. We released this letter publicly in April 2019, and so far over 8,300 Amazon workers have signed it. In May 2019, AECJ members brought the climate plan resolution to the annual shareholders meeting in Seattle. The resolution did not receive enough votes to pass, but AECJ members delivered a speech at the meeting and held a press conference. Tell me about that experience. All of us stood up while our coworker from AECJ presented our resolution. She addressed Bezos directly and asked him to come onstage, which he declined to do. She read our request for Amazon to commit to a carbon plan and to release its carbon footprint. Then she asked everyone who supported the resolution to stand up with us. Almost everyone in the room did, not just the Amazon employees. It was a very emotional moment in what is typically a very unemotional space. Yesterday, AECJ publicly announced the next step in its campaign: a walkout by Amazon employees all over the world to join the youth-led global climate strike on 20 September. How did you put this action together? As soon as Greta Thunberg called for a global climate strike, AECJ members wanted to know how we could help. We also needed to escalate our campaign. We’ve been seeing management listen but we haven’t seen management understand. They’re not giving us concrete commitments. They’re not feeling the urgency. Why do a walkout? Why did you choose this tactic? Walking out is a symbol of employees coming together. It’s also a way of celebrating how large AECJ has become, and signaling to management and to one another that this has gone on for too long. That business as usual is not cutting it. The response so far has been incredible. Since we first announced the walkout internally last Wednesday, over 1,000 Amazon employees have pledged to walk out. And the number is growing fast. You said that systemic change requires collective action. How does the walkout demonstrate that idea? A lot of people don’t realize the strength they can wield in their workplace. I certainly didn’t. Amazon is not Jeff Bezos alone. Amazon is Amazon because of the workers who work for it. It needs all of us to function, from the people in the offices writing software to the people in the warehouses packing boxes. When you realize that, you realize the power is not at the top. It’s at the bottom, collectively, with all of the people working together to keep the company running. The statement that AECJ released yesterday to announce the walkout puts forward three climate demands for Amazon. Let’s start with the first one: you want the company to commit to zero emissions by 2030. This is our number one request. The scientific consensus is that we need to cut global emissions to net zero by 2050 to limit global temperature rise to 1.5C. But in the US and global north, we need to cut our emissions even faster. Why? Because we have been polluting more than our fair share and we have a responsibility to take more aggressive action. We also have the resources to develop the new technologies that will be needed to facilitate the transition and to make such technologies readily accessible around the world.  Your second demand is for zero custom AWS contracts for fossil fuel companies. Scientists have told us that the amount of oil and gas that we can safely continue to extract is zero. The fact that Amazon is not only using these fuels but partnering with companies to help them accelerate extraction and find new sources of oil is really alarming. And your third demand is for the company to stop funding politicians and lobbyists who deny the science on climate change. I was shocked to learn that Amazon funds climate denial. The most egregious example is the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), a thinktank that has long challenged climate science. Moreover, Amazon donated to 68 members of Congress in 2018 who voted against climate legislation 100% of the time. Climate isn’t the only issue that Amazon workers are organizing around. Since last year, workers have been pushing the company to stop selling AWS services to Palantir and other firms who enable US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), as well as to stop selling facial recognition software to law enforcement – a campaign now known internally as We Won’t Build It. Meanwhile, workers at Amazon warehouses in Minnesota have conducted three different strikes for better working conditions this year. What is the relationship between these actions and the work that AECJ is doing? All of these fights are connected. I have a lot of respect for the We Won’t Build It campaign – I proudly wear its pin to work. And I have an immense amount of respect for the Minnesota workers. When the workers at the Shakopee, Minnesota, fulfillment center announced they would be striking on Prime Day, AECJ gathered statements of solidarity from Amazon employees in corporate offices around the world. AECJ members then brought these statements to Shakopee personally to show their support. If we didn’t have fulfillment workers, then I couldn’t do my job. Our work is completely dependent on theirs. And it takes a whole lot more bravery for them to speak up than it does for people like me. What about the relationship of the AECJ to the wider tech worker movement that has emerged over the past year or two? Tech workers at a number of companies are organizing to oppose contracts with Ice and US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) under the banner of #TechWontBuildIt. Last year at Google, workers forced management to cancel its contract with the Pentagon for Project Maven, a program that uses machine learning to improve targeting for drone strikes. Then came the Google walkout, a global work stoppage by 20,000 Googlers to protest sexism and discrimination in the workplace. How does AECJ and your upcoming walkout fit into this broader picture? I’ve been incredibly inspired by the Google walkout and the #TechWontBuildIt campaigns. It’s like there’s been an awakening. Previously, people might’ve been comfortable looking the other way or putting their head in the sand. Not anymore. More and more people are standing up and saying: “This isn’t right.” And if one person says that, and then finds someone else who agrees with them, that’s all you need to start a movement. When I hear about actions at other tech companies, I’m inspired. It’s a reminder that we have power. And that our power comes from standing together in solidarity. Moral fortitude is contagious. When you see workers at other companies taking a stand, you want to take a stand yourself. If other tech workers are reading this conversation, what would you say to them? How would you persuade them to get involved? Being a tech worker doesn’t insulate you from climate impacts. The fulfillment workers in Minnesota are striking for bathroom breaks. We’re not asking for bathroom breaks because yes, we have bathroom breaks. Actually, most of us love our jobs. What we’re asking for is a future. Last year, I lived on Bainbridge Island outside of Seattle. I would take a ferry into work every morning. And at one point, the wildfires were so bad I couldn’t breathe. Everyone was wearing face masks. That isn’t the world I want to live in, where we’ve poisoned the air so badly that it poisons us. I remember learning about global warming in school. I remember thinking that all these problems would be fixed by the time I graduated from college because we have leaders. I grew up waiting for them to fix this. They didn’t. Then I changed how I thought about who leaders are. Greta Thunberg is a leader. The over 8,300 Amazon workers who signed the open letter to Bezos, those are leaders. Those of us who are walking out of our offices on 20 September, we are leaders."

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn a controversial interview, German doctor Wolfgang Wodarg – now Germany’s science public enemy No. 1 – called the response to the COVID-19 virus by governments and health authorities “a crime against humanity” and that they be put on the dock for “negligent homicide”.
Using panic to extort the public… lobbyists for the pharmaceutical industry… the scandal of hydroxychloroquine and the WHO…the dangers of a half-baked vaccine…panicking people into accepting vaccinations, surveillance and restrictions.

The video, released on May 31st dubbed “A Crime Against Humanity“, has been viewed already 150,000 times and delivers a dramatic message that the German media-political monopoly do not want to hear: Hysteria, corruption, and gross negligence surround the COVID-19 crisis.
Robbed freedom by causing a panic
The 73-year old Wodarg first says that the COVID-19 bug was no worse than any other bad flu and that officials created panic among the citizens by using the results of a faulty test, thus robbing them of their freedom.
He accuses Germany’s Minister of Health Jens Spahn of being a lobbyist who collects data for the pharmaceutical industry and being corrupt. Wodarg also warns the public of tracking apps: “They want to extort you. They want to extort you to go along, to be afraid so that you accept being vaccinated. We are being told that this vaccine could save us. This a vaccine that has been rapidly and shoddily thrown together,” he says.
Dangerous vaccination proposals
Dr. Wodarg explains how it takes at least 5 years to produce a trustworthy vaccine and warns of the untold risks of something rushed onto the market.
“Now they want to vaccinate billions of people; it’s fully irresponsible to do that with such a vaccine. I can only say don’t let your children be vaccinated; don’t let yourself be vaccinated with such a negligently manufactured, rushed vaccine. It’s only to make money, and the money making works only because we are being extorted by the media and policy making through fear. It’s like mafia protection money.”
Hydroxychloroquine scandal

Dr. Wodarg also explains another grisly aspect of the COVID-19 pandemic, which he calls “a crime against humanity”: a well known drug for treating malaria, Wodarg said: “Suddenly all over the world, hydroxychloroquine was recommended. It was even given away for free by Bayer.” But with the drug comes lethal affects for people who come from tropical areas and thus have “an enzyme defect”, Wodarg explains. Many people from Africa have this enzyme characteristic, people from Brazil, Central America, but also people from the Mediterranean countries, says Wodarg.
When these people are administered the recommended dosage, then after two days they are unable to get air. And if you continue to give it to them, then they die. Every medical student knows this! And a doctor who uses this drug without checking for the enzyme is acting with gross negligence.”
Malpractice “borders on genocide”
He adds it doesn’t surprise him that people are dying. Wodarg cites a recent study where data from 96,000 patients infected by COVID-19 from 671 hospitals were examined. Of the large number who were treated with hydroxychloroquine, 30% to 40% more died. And when one looks at the black and Hispanic people, then over 50% more died. “That means they are the ones who were killed by the stuff, and what happened there borders on genocide. I think what happened here is gross negligence.”
“Case for prosecutors”
Wodarg points the finger at the WHO, suspecting that a certain number of people were to die in order to create fear: “…so that fear is generated in Africa, in Brazil, so that we take the illness seriously and say: oh, it’s really bad, and we urgently need the vaccine. That’s insidious; it’s diabolical what’s taking place here. This is not a case for immunologist, but for prosecutors!”
The former German health official says every medical student learns about hydroxychloroquine in the fourth semester.
On whether there is a way out of the mess, Wodarg comments:
We have to file a lawsuit, that it’s negligent homicide, at least this is happening internationally. I don’t know if there is a prosecutor in Geneva who would go to the WHO and say: ‘Stop, halt! The files please. I want to see them. Did you know it? Did you deal with that? Why not? You’re supposed to know this. You’re doctors after all.’ And this should apply to the health services.”
Black lives don’t matter: “going to kill 20 – 30%” in Africa 
Wodarg calls what’s happening with the use of hydroxychloroquine in tropical countries a “catastrophe”.
“They know they are going to kill 20 to 30% of the people with it.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterHigh-profile Swiss meteorologist Jörg Kachelmann has penned a stinging commentary in the online Bayerischer Kurier concerning all the climate doomsday hysteria sweeping across Europe, and warns history tells us such hysteria has never turned out well.

PIK’s “silly” science, doomsday prophets
The veteran meteorologist, who is convinced the planet is indeed warming due to man’s activities, worries that environmental groups have been getting away with falsehoods and how the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) is promoting “silly” science and “view themselves as the prophets of the imminent end of the world.”
One problem with all the über-alarmism, Kachelmann sees, is a tendency of people simply resigning because they’ve come to believe that nothing can be done to stop the coming doomsday, and so why bother trying.
He also sharply criticizes green activists who blame every extreme weather event on man-made climate change, writing that it is “desperate and scientifically completely wrong”.

Future scenarios as the present – bigger media bang!
One reason the activists have become so shrill, Kachelmann believes, is due in large part to the media’s willingness to run with every sensational story without an inkling of background checking.
“Since votes are to be won now, scientifically quite justifiable predictions for the future are quickly changed into the present, because there’s a bigger bang. The charlatans are certain that this mischief will spread through the media at a time when most German states have largely abolished science education.”
“Whoring for clicks”…”bullshit sells”
“The collective disinformation unscientists meet up with a sad media situation, where the successful whoring for clicks is more important than even the smallest quantities of respectability. Stupid clicks well, says Kachelmann. “But that doesn’t matter to “Focus”, “Merkur” or the “Süddeutsche” [publications]. It still gets written because bullshit sells.”
Woodstoves, not cars, are worst polluters
Another hot issue in Germany is fine particle pollution. Here Kachelmann also sees policymakers stampeding down the wrong solution path, and are falsely putting most of the blame on automobiles: “The exceedance of fine particles and other pollutants is almost exclusively due not to traffic, but to wood-burning stoves, which have recently multiplied in densely populated areas, because insane people claim that they are “ecological.”
Over the recent years the German government has been turning a blind eye to dirty wood-burning stoves – even supporting their use. Now towns and villages across Germany are filled with choking smoke from the supposedly climate-friendly burning of wood.

Image Source: Etsy.com
Globally, coasts have grown since the 1980s
Between 1985 and 2015, satellite observations indicate the world’s coasts gained 13,565 km²  more land area than they had lost to the seas (Donchyts et al., 2016).
This means more coastal land area is above sea level today than in the 1980s.
This surprises scientists, as they “expected the coast would start to retreat due to sea level rise,” but instead they observed “coasts are growing all over the world.”

Image Source(s): Donchyts et al., 2016 and BBC (press release)
Duvat (2019) also identified a global trend in island shoreline net growth since the 1980s despite recent sea level rise, as none of the globe’s islands larger than 10 ha – and just 1.2% of the 334 islands larger than 5 ha – have decreased in size since the 1980s.
These recent trends would appear to be the opposite of what would be expected with modern global warming.
Are relative sea levels lower now than during the 1800s?

As the climate warms and glaciers and ice sheets melt, it’s assumed coasts should be much smaller today than they were during the much colder and more glaciated Little Ice Age (1400-1900 A.D.).
But shorelines are not clearly smaller today according to highly detailed maps dated to the 17th to 19th centuries.
Below are 4 examples of direct comparisons between today’s Google Maps images of islands and maps from 1802, 1873, 1893, and even 1640. Each suggest there may have been slightly more land area underwater during the Little Ice Age than today.
1. An 1893 nautical map of the UK’s Isle of Man shows there was more land area underwater in 1893 than in 2019.

2. Here is an 1802 nautical map of New York City and Long Island. There may have been more open waters in this region during the Little Ice Age than in 2019.

3. A 1640 Dutch map of Taiwan shows this land area was no larger than it is today during the Little Ice Age. It even seems small nearby islands were further underwater 380 years ago than they are now.

"Leaked communications suggest that the UN’s migration agency is censoring itself on the climate crisis and the global compact on migration, following pressure from the US government. An email sent by a US-based official of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) on 28 August to colleagues around the world relayed that the US state department’s Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration (PRM) told the agency documents related to programme activities it funds “must not be in conflict with current [US government] political sensitivities”.  Sensitivities include the climate crisis, sustainable development goals, the global compact for migration and “anything that seems at odds with the administration’s take on US domestic/foreign issues”, the official wrote in the email. “Documents related to programme activities, especially those that will be published online, may require prior review and approval by the donor,” they went on, requesting that colleagues use “discretion” and share relevant documents “in enough time to make any necessary adjustments in coordination with PRM”. The email’s author noted that “PRM is very willing to cut funding in areas that it deems are not in line with US foreign policy objectives”, and asked that the substance of the email be conveyed by regional coordinators “to all country focal points”. The Guardian understands from IOM sources and further communications it has seen that the agency is avoiding direct references to climate change in documents for projects funded by other US government entities such as USAid. IOM receives about a quarter of its total budget of $2bn (£1.6bn) from the US, $18m of which is provided by PRM. There is no indication that messaging on projects funded by other donors will be censored, or that there will be any operational impact on existing programmes. However, a source in the humanitarian community in the US who had recently left IOM, told the Guardian he was “very concerned … that IOM is acquiescing to this kind of pressure”. “I’ve seen a response [to the email] from at least one regional official who explicitly asked staff not to directly refer to climate change or the global compact on migration in a range of reports or proposals that would be sent to the US government,” he said. “While I understand that IOM are simply doing what they think is strategically necessary to protect funding for important projects, senior officials should be mindful of the fact that there’s a slippery slope here,” he continued. Jeff Crisp, a research associate at Oxford University’s Refugee Studies Centre who previously held a senior position in the UN’s refugee agency UNHCR, said the leaked message “raises some serious questions about the autonomy of IOM, its sensitivity to positions adopted by the US administration, and its ability to function as a member of the UN system”. Akshaya Kumar, director of crisis advocacy at Human Rights Watch, said: “Confronting climate change may very well be the issue that defines our time. Agencies in the UN family shouldn’t be towing the Trump party line.” Tensions between the US and IOM have simmered over the past year, when Ken Isaacs, the proposed US candidate to head the agency, became the first American since the 1960s to be rejected as its top official, prompting concerns that funding from the state department could be cut. Press reports at the time revealed that Isaacs had made comments online expressing doubts over the evidence for climate change, suggesting it was a “hoax”. President Trump himself has expressed doubts about the effects and causes of climate change, while the US objected to the global compact on migration, describing it as a “pro-migration” agreement and an “effort by the United Nations to advance global governance at the expense of the sovereign right of states”. Leonard Doyle, IOM’s head of communications, said: “IOM recognises and respects the priorities and limitations of its donors, including the US. We seek to ensure that staff are aware of such sensitivities when drafting funding proposals for activities which are a response to migration trends and which follow best practice.” A US state department spokesperson said: “IOM is an important partner for the United States around the globe. The US government supports organisations such as IOM, to conduct programmes and activities that are consistent with our foreign policy goals and objectives.” • This article was amended on 11 September 2019. The International Organization for Migration is the UN’s migration agency, not its refugee agency as an earlier version said."
"It has been described by scientists as “the greatest orgy in the world”; an annual gamete-fest, where entire colonies of coral reefs release their sperm and eggs simultaneously in a slick on the ocean surface that has been seen from space. But now scientists fear the climate crisis may be disrupting the ability of corals to synchronise this marine phenomenon, threatening them with extinction. A Tel Aviv university study, published in Science, has found the release of eggs and sperm in certain reef-building corals in the Gulf of Eilat in the Red Sea have changed over time and have lost their synchronicity. For a coral, reliant on a chance encounter, timing is everything. But researchers have found some are spawning “out of tune” with normal patterns, with the result that fewer baby corals are forming.  “Coral spawning … is one of the greatest examples of synchronised phenomena in nature,” said Professor Yossi Loya, of the university’s School of Zoology. “Once a year, thousands of corals along hundreds of kilometres of a coral reef release their eggs and sperm simultaneously into the open water, where fertilisation will later take place. Since both the eggs and the sperm of corals can persist only a few hours in the water, the timing of this event is critical.” Although visually, the coral reefs seemed healthy, the corals suffering a breakdown in spawning synchrony produced fewer baby corals, creating circumstances for extinction. While it is not yet fully understood exactly how spawning synchrony works, scientists say it relies on environmental cues, including sea temperature, solar irradiance, wind, the phase of the moon and the time of sunset. The researchers began monitoring corals in the Gulf of Eilat in 2015 and, over four years, recorded the number of spawning individuals during the annual coral reproductive season, between June and September. They compared spawning timings of five coral species between 2015 and 2018 to results from two other studies conducted on the same species in the 1980s.  “We found that, in some of the most abundant coral species, the spawning synchrony had become erratic, contrasting both the widely accepted paradigm of highly synchronous coral spawning and studies performed on the exact same reefs decades ago,” said Tom Shlesinger, a PhD student and co-author of the study. To find out whether this failure in spawning synchrony translated into reproductive failure, they mapped thousands of corals within permanent reef plots, revisiting the plots every year to see how many corals of a given species had died, compared to new juveniles. “Although it appeared that the overall state of the coral reefs at Eilat was quite good and every year we found many new corals recruiting to the reefs, for those species that are suffering from the breakdown in spawning synchrony, there was a clear lack of recruitment of new juvenile generations, meaning that some species that currently appear to be abundant may actually be nearing extinction through reproductive failure,” said Shlesinger. It is not yet known what was causing the loss of synchrony. However, the researchers found temperature had a “strong influence” on coral reproductive cycles. In the study region, temperatures are rising “fast”, at rate of 0.31C a decade. Another plausible cause could be endocrine or hormonal disrupting pollutants, accumulating in marine environments, they said. The study was based on five corals; however, the researchers believe their findings could be a warning to other species. “Regardless of the exact cause leading to these declines in spawning synchrony, our findings serve as a timely wake-up call to start considering these subtler challenges to coral survival, which are very likely also impacting additional species in other regions,” said Shlesinger. “On a positive note, identifying early warning signs of such reproductive mismatches will contribute to directing our future research and conservation efforts toward the very species that are at potential risk of decline, long before they even display any visible signs of stress or mortality.”"
"Eight protesters are to go on trial in Paris on Wednesday for stealing official portraits of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, from public buildings as part of a protest over climate change. The activists, aged 23 to 36, have been charged with theft after taking down the pictures from local government offices around the capital in February.  The acts of civil disobedience were part of a movement called Take Down Macron, which was intended to highlight alleged inaction by the French government over the global crisis. The group behind it, Non-Violent Action COP21 (ANV-COP21), claims that 128 portraits have been stolen across France, while 57 people face “group theft” charges that carry a maximum five-year jail term. Several hundred protesters held up the portraits during a protest in south-western France at the end of August near Biarritz, where Macron was hosting a G7 summit of world leaders. “Solidarity with the people who took down the portraits of our presidential monarch,” leftwing political leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon tweeted on Tuesday.  Cécile Duflot, the head of campaign group Oxfam in France, also backed the protesters, writing: “It’s a symbolic action and not a group theft.” All public schools and government offices display the president’s portrait, with Macron’s showing him perched on the edge of his desk with two mobile phones and the memoirs of French resistance hero and post-war president Charles de Gaulle behind him. It is not the first time the picture of the 41-year-old leader has been targeted. In October 2017, mayors in the central Creuse region turned Macron’s picture round so that he faced the wall, in protest at cuts to local government budgets and job losses. The first trial over the thefts of presidential portraits took place at the end of May in the eastern town of Bourg-en-Bresse. An environmental campaigner was fined €250 (£222) and five others received suspended fines."

Share this...FacebookTwitterA commentary titled “‘Just don’t panic – also about climate change’” by Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt appearing at German site achgut.com tells us there’s no need for panic with respect to climate change, as leading scientists dial back earlier doomsday projections.

No warming until 2050
Vahrenholt claims a negative Atlantic oscillation is ahead of us and the expected second weak solar cycle in succession will reduce anthropogenic warming in the next 15-30 years. He cites a recent publication by Judith Curry, who sees a pause in the temperature rise until 2050 as the most likely scenario.
Vahrenholt and Curry are not alone when it comes to believing a natural-variability-watered-down warming is in the works. Also IPCC heavyweight Jochem Marotzke from the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg takes a similar stand in a publication in the Environmental Research Letters.
In the paper Marotzke concludes that all locations examined show “a cooling trend or lack of warming trend”and that there is “no warming due to natural cooling effects” and that in calculations up to 2049. The researchers find “a large part of the earth will not warm up because of internal variability”.
Distancing from alarmists Schellnhuber, Rahmstorf
And recently The Max Planck Institute Director Marotzke said in an interview with Andreas Frey of the Frankfurter Allgemeinen Zeitung (FAZ) that there was no need to panic, thus clearly splitting from the doomsday scenarios put out by his alarmist colleagues Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber and Stefan Rahmstorf.

In the FAZ interview, Marotzke also said there was no need to worry that the port city of Hamburg would be flooded in 2100: “Hamburg will not be threatened, that is totally clear.”
Areas not going to be wiped out
Marotzke then told the FAZ that the fears that children have today for the future are not absolutely well founded, and that entire areas are not going to be wiped out, as often often suggested by alarmists.
Sensational French models
When asked why the French issued a press release warning of worse than expected warming, Marotzke said: “We thought, my God, what are you doing? Because it is very unlikely that the true climate is as sensitive as shown in the new models.”
When asked by the FAZ why the French had put out such dramatic numbers, Marotzke said: “I don’t know,” adding that the climate models are highly complex. “Too many calculation steps overlap, and sometimes we ourselves are amazed at what we do not understand“.
Speaking up against alarmist models
Vahrenholt summarizes the growing doubt by scientists such as Curry and Marotzke over the use of alarmist models:
One gets the impression someone is speaking out against the alarmist use of models. Perhaps Jochem Marotzke is aware that with the warming coming to an end in the next 30 years, model alarmists (Schellnhuber: “We only have 10 years left“) will have unpleasant questions to answer. When society realizes that the climate modelers have exaggerated in order to make a political difference, we will know who misled the politicians.”

"This is an obituary for quaint slab-wood cabins, a place that was burned down on the weekend in a fire devastating for the many thousands of people who have visited over the past 85 years. Binna Burra Lodge, in the world-heritage-listed rainforest of Lamington national park, has been destroyed by bushfire.  Binna Burra was the environmental lodge started by conservationist and adventurer Arthur Groom and engineer Romeo Lahey (brother of artist Vida) in 1933 as a place for ordinary people to “experience the grandeur”. It was never luxurious, with cabins, a big fireplace in the reception lounge and access to a forest like no other. There’s still only one road in, from the Gold Coast to the ridge of Beechmont and then, a single-lane final climb through eucalyptus forest to the edge of the rainforest. Often the place is shrouded in mist. Most years, it rains a lot. I first visited Binna Burra as a high school biology student 40 years ago, staying in the dorm accommodation at the campsite across from the main lodge. I had all the attitude of a damaged teen and a firm belief that nothing could surprise or move me. And yet, here it was, this place of giant trees and different air and light that changes minute to minute. The birds, the understory, the smell of it. I can’t hope to make you understand. You’d have to go there. I do not come from a hiking family – we never once visited a national park – but that first experience began for me a lifelong love affair with this national park in particular and national parks more generally. And what a gift it has been. Like a mother, the rainforest at Binna Burra takes you in its arms. In one way or another, I have been in those arms ever since. Binna Burra Lodge’s bird-in-boots logo was possibly daggy when it was launched in the 70s, and it’s even more daggy 50 years on. I say this with all due affection, an affection I know is shared by other visitors. They will have slept in bunk rooms with shared amenities or splurged on a cabin of their own with a bathroom. They might have spent rainy days in the upstairs “library” with its yellowed books donated by guests. They’ll have enjoyed a pre-dinner drink (or cup of tea) while watching the sunset under massive gums on the terrace. They’ll have eaten the fancy boarding school food in the dining room, supplies trucked up three times a week – hash browns at breakfast, three meats and a veggie option at dinner, soup in a massive tureen on each table with fresh baked bread. More recently, they might have stayed in the self-contained skylodges, less bluestone, less timber but still with that simplicity that admits the grandeur. And they’ll have walked. They’ll have taken a packed lunch of meats and salads and bread and fruit cake on the trail. They might have gone just a little way in, to Tullawallal, rewarded by the sight of those ancient Antarctic beech trees Binna Burra is named for. Even in an hour in the rainforest, they’ve heard more birds and seen more trees than in a week in a city. They return to the lodge and the staff listen as they describe a lyrebird’s call as if they are the first person who’s ever heard it. Others may have walked more kilometres than they thought possible. Once, I went abseiling with a lodge group. We hiked out and crawled through narrow caves to drop down off the Shipstern and Turtle Rock, finishing in the evening at Natural Bridge to see the glow-worms. I’m afraid of heights and small spaces. It didn’t matter out there. In recent years, I have shied away from the lodge, preferring a campsite in the national park to a soft bed and conviviality. Perhaps I’ve wanted time alone, grieving for the world, but now, I wish I’d stayed at the lodge more often. You’d look around the dining room at night and you’d see it on the faces. It’s wonder, the experience of awe. It’s what nature gives us, a chance to be small, insignificant. At Binna Burra, you are gently encouraged to come to understand just how little you matter. And it’s a relief. The fire was swift and out of control by Friday when the lodge was evacuated. On Saturday, no one could get in to fight it. It was a black dawn for Binna Burra’s director and 70 staff on Sunday. The dining room is gone. The lodge cabins are all gone. Even the new sky lodges are devastated. Perhaps it was always written that this would happen. It has happened. A place that offered nothing but a way to help us see has been destroyed by our blindness. Now is the time, if you have breath in your body and have ever experienced Lamington national park and Binna Burra Lodge, to help them out in whatever way you can. I am hoping they will set up a support page. I will be on it as soon as they do. Because the rainforest is still there to be shared. There is something fundamentally good and unchanged about Binna Burra, as if the place itself takes over whoever happens to be in charge. Whatever rises from the ashes will be different; of course it will. But the new Binna Burra will still be the place where Antarctic beech trees grow. It can provide another generation and another with the safest arms they will ever rest in. It’s us who have a chance to do something to help make it real.

"The world’s biggest producers of meat, dairy and seafood are failing to tackle the enormous impact they are having on the planet through deforestation, the routine use of antibiotics and greenhouse gas emissions, a report warns. The Coller Fairr index ranks 50 of the largest global meat, dairy and fish producers by looking at risk factors from use of antibiotics to deforestation and labour abuses. The producers are the “hidden” supply chain, providing meat and dairy to global brands including McDonald’s, Tesco, Nestlé and Walmart.  The index is written by investment experts who want to encourage awareness of the risks posed to the planet – and to their own profitability – by companies that fail to mitigate the damage done to the environment by food production. Jeremy Coller is founder of Fairr and chief investment officer at Coller Capital. He says it is the huge companies behind the brands that will themselves suffer if the planet isn’t protected. “It is the companies hidden upstream in the meat and dairy supply chain who face the most significant climate and public health risks. “As last month’s landmark report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) demonstrated, the world’s meat, fish and dairy industries are under serious threat from climate change impacts. In stark contrast to the transport sector, only one in four meat, fish and dairy producers even measure their greenhouse gas emissions, let alone act to reduce them.” Among other failings, the index says that none of the companies analysed have a comprehensive policy to stop deforestation. And just four companies in the index “have committed to phasing out routine use of antibiotics, widespread in the industry”. According to the report, two-thirds of producers do not even measure all their greenhouse gas emissions let alone set targets to reduce them. These include Hormel Foods in the US, a supplier to McDonald’s. Also included is Cal-Maine Foods. Cal-Maine is the largest producer of fresh eggs in the US and a supplier to Walmart and Nestle. Nestlé, McDonald’s and Walmart have all publicly committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. And while Walmart has previously said it wants to achieve zero net deforestation in its supply chain by 2020, the research shows that Walmart suppliers such as Cranswick in the UK have no comprehensive policy on deforestation. McDonald’s have pledged to reduce antibiotics use in their beef supply chains. But the vast majority of beef suppliers do not have a policy to avoid routine use of antibiotics. Only one – Marfrig – does. The companies are ranked according to their risk for investors, based on analysis of nine key environmental, social and governance risk factors, combined with the sustainable development goals. The Hong Kong-based WH Group were noted as “high risk” while Hormel Foods and Cranswick were designated as “medium risk”. The research argues that some of the companies, who between them have a value of $300bn (£248bn), are already suffering the costs of the deepening climate crisis. Cal-Maine Foods reported a 30% decline in revenues in the last quarter of the year alone due to extreme weather. Peter Van der Werf is an engagement specialist at investment firm Robeco, advising on how to invest sustainably. He told the Guardian that research into the environmental risks of food production is vital. “This is very important research. As investment managers we take a lot of care assessing risk – for example an analyst looking at food production needs to have a good understanding of climate change risks … like deforestation, loss of feed supply that comes through cattle grazing on depleted land, use of water.” Van der Werf says that he can see progress being made as producers are made aware of the benefit of considering environmental risks. “Companies were previously reluctant to show an interest in alternative proteins like fake meat, but we have seen a huge growth in demand. We started engagement over labour safety and use of antibiotics and over three years we have clearly seen an engagement and awareness. Now Tyson Foods, for example, has climate targets. They didn’t have that before.” He says the end aim is for producers and investors to move away from meat and fish as protein sources as much as possible. “The fires we have seen in the Amazon have come up in conversations with investors. They are concerned about climate change, about forest fires. There is a global need to further reduce reliance on meat and dairy and look at different protein choices.” A spokesman for the National Farmers’ Union told the Guardian that there is a commitment to achieving net zero carbon emissions in the UK farming industry by 2040. He said this will be achieved through improving efficiency and animal welfare, managing carbon storage on farms and boosting renewable energy. The Guardian contacted the companies named but at the time of publication had not received responses from all of them. Nestle said: “The Nestlé Responsible Sourcing Standard sets out sustainability practices that we ask our suppliers, their employees, agents and subcontractors to respect and adhere to at all times. In addition, we run a responsible sourcing program for 15 high-priority raw materials, including meat, poultry and eggs and dairy. For these materials, our work starts by mapping our supply chain all the way down to the farm or slaughterhouse. When suppliers refuse to improve, we will remove them from our supply chain.” Walmart said: “We believe that both collaborative action and traceability across our global supply chain are needed to reduce deforestation associated with the production of beef and soy in Brazil. We’re working with the Consumer Goods Forum, the Tropical Forest Alliance and the Statement of Support Group for the Cerrado Manifesto as we work toward our goal to reduce deforestation.” A Tesco spokesperson said: “Food is at the heart of our business, and our commitment to sustainable sourcing is recognised by FAIRR both in this report and its recent ‘Appetite for disruption’ report, where Tesco topped the retail ranking for our focus on sustainable protein. We set ourselves ambitious and transparent sustainability targets, including across carbon reduction, biodiversity and tackling deforestation, which we will meet through working in partnership with our suppliers.” Tyson Foods said: “We recently announced a science-based target to decrease greenhouse gas emissions 30% by 2030 as well as a partnership with Environmental Defense Fund focused on increasing sustainable farming practices on more than 2m acres of row crop corn by 2020. This is the largest commitment ever made by a US protein company, and we will be reporting on our progress over time.” Hormel said: “As a global branded food company, we take our sustainability practices very seriously. We are working toward achieving our 2020 goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and non-renewable energy use by 10% by 2020. “We are pleased to see the report highlighted our company as one of the leaders in the industry and showcased Hormel Foods for our best practices for water usage. Additionally, the report singled out Hormel Foods as being the only company that has established a sustainable agricultural policy that extends to feed-grain growers.”"
"This week started out like most weeks for Donald Trump: a Monday morning spent sending a flurry of unhinged tweets then a quick break to indulge in some offline racism. Addressing reporters on the White House lawn before heading to a campaign rally, Trump said he was keeping a close eye on the situation in the Bahamas. Particularly since the people fleeing the grim aftermath of Hurricane Dorian and trying to come to America might be dangerous drug dealers. Presumably because they are black. “The Bahamas had some tremendous problems with people going to the Bahamas that weren’t supposed to be there,” Trump said. “I don’t want to allow people that weren’t supposed to be in the Bahamas to come into the United States, including some very bad people and some very bad gang members and some very, very bad drug dealers.”  Like most things Trump says, this statement is very, very removed from reality. But who needs facts when you can appeal to racist feelings? Trump’s smearing of Hurricane Dorian survivors builds on his tried-and-tested strategy of dehumanising non-white people by describing them as “bad hombres,” rapists and MS-13 gang members. It builds on his strategy of describing any non-white person seeking refuge in America as a threat to the country. Trump’s comments, it should be noted, were prompted by a question about an incident on Sunday in which 119 Bahamian evacuees, including children, were told to get off a ferry bound for Florida because they didn’t have US visas. This came as a shock because Bahamians don’t need visas to visit America if they don’t have a police record and plan a short stay. According to an American reporter on the ferry, the evacuees he spoke to didn’t plan to move to the US, “They were coming to go grocery shopping, stay in a hotel with AC [air conditioning], chill for a little and then head back.” Nobody is entirely sure where the last-minute visa order came from. The US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency’s Florida office initially pointed the blame at Baleària, the ferry company. “It breaks my heart,” a CBP spokesman told Newsweek on Monday. “It’s like when you raise somebody’s hopes and then you pop the balloon ...That, in my opinion, is what Baleària did.” Baleària, on the other hand, has said it was advised of the documentation requirements by the CBP. Meanwhile, Trump’s acting CBP head, Mark Morgan, blamed the ferry fiasco on confusion. It is perfectly possible that nothing more insidious than administrative confusion led to those 119 Bahamians being kicked off a ferry. But Trump’s comments about “very bad people” also means it’s perfectly possible that more malicious motives were at play. No matter who is at fault, however, this episode should leave us all very unsettled. As the climate crisis progresses, there will be more climate migrants seeking temporary or permanent reprieve. They will not be met with open arms and open borders. They will be met with no legal recognition and little protection, as they won’t have refugee status. They will be met with racism. They will be met, as a UN expert recently warned, with a growing system of climate apartheid. And, if the likes of Katie Hopkins (Trump’s favourite Brit) have their way, eventually they will be met with gun boats."

Share this...FacebookTwitterDespite the German government’s renewed commitment to meeting its CO2 emissions target by expanding wind energy, online weekly FOCUS here reports that wind energy appears to be on the verge of collapse and that “German climate targets are in danger.”

Bleak times for Germany’s wind industry. Photo. P. Gosselin
Lowest activity since ‘Energiewende’ began in 2000
FOCUS cites wind industry officials who say that the building of wind parks has reached the lowest point in 20 years. The industry associations are calling on the government to take action and for approval procedures for wind farms to be simplified and acceptance by residents increased.
Falling acceptance

Many German states have imposed strict setback rules to keep wind parks away from residential areas. For example, the 10H rules is in effect in Bavaria. Here, a wind turbines cannot be located near residents  at a distance that is closer than 10 times its height, making many wind projects in the south German state impossible.  The industry is pressuring governments to soften the rules.
Yet an online poll conducted by FOCUS shows that almost two thirds of respondents are not in favor or are undecided on reducing setback distances.
Protest against wind energy “booming these days”
Earlier in 2019, Germany’s centre-left Tagesspiegel here reported, “The protest against wind energy is booming these days” and according analysts, “about 1000 citizens’ initiatives are currently fighting against the wind industry in Germany” and that “they are very well networked”.
55% less turbines built in 2019
The lack of acceptance among the public — along with economic and technical obstacles — has put the brakes on wind park construction. FOCUS writes: “According to the industry associations Bundesverband Windenergie (BWE) and VDMA Power Systems, only 325 new wind turbines with 1078 megawatts were built in 2019. This was 55 percent less than in the previous year.”

"Hillsides across Britain have turned from glorious purple to muddy brown because of a worrying loss of heather, conservationists have warned. The National Trust has flagged up that 75% of the plant has been lost or is struggling on some slopes that it manages in the west of England and blames the climate emergency for the problem.  Experts from the Heather Trust, which is based in Dumfries and Galloway, south-west Scotland, said it was seeing similar problems across moorland in Scotland, northern England and Wales. According to the National Trust, the hills at Long Mynd in Shropshire and Holnicote in Somerset are typically awash with a haze of purple through August and into early September. But this year the National Trust, which cares for both landscapes, has seen up to 75% of the heather in poor health due to a combination of last year’s drought and damage from the heather beetle. Peter Carty, its countryside parkland and gardens manager in Shropshire, said: “Last year’s high temperatures, and subsequent lack of rain, damaged a large area of heather and it is clear from the orangey-brown coloration this year that the plants are seriously stressed and unlikely to flower. “The milder winter also led to an increase in the heather beetle numbers, which are a natural element of the heather ecosystem, as it wasn’t cold enough to kill off their larvae. The beetle affects heather by damaging the outer layers of the leaf, making it more susceptible to drought stress. “In places where heather was sheltered from the extreme or where damp conditions were present, the heather has survived. However, there will be no mass flowering this year.” Carty, who has worked in the area for 20 years, said the slopes were the dullest in living memory and blames the climate emergency. The state of the heather on the Shropshire hills had improved over the decades with conservationists working with the “commoners” who have the rights to graze animals on the slopes to limit the damage sheep can cause. The lack of blooming heather has serious impacts on other wildlife, such as the red grouse and emperor moth, which in its caterpillar stage relies on the plant for food. Carty said: “At this time of year the slopes should be purple and stunningly beautiful. The sight of the heather is one of the highlights of the year. It’s really sad. It brings it home to me that no matter how much work landowners and conservationists do, climate change is the much wider problem we have to address.” Keith Jones, a climate change specialist at the National Trust, added: “We are seeing first-hand the impacts of climate change on at least two of these special landscapes within our care. “Last year’s prolonged hot summer vastly restricted the supply of water to the plants. This, together with the lack of rain over the winter and first half of the year, has not been enough to replenish the plants.” The team at Holnicote on the edge of Exmoor is working on a solution to help with the land drying out by planting more trees to help slow the flow of water further up the valley as part of its Riverlands project. It is also restoring wet habitats such as blanket bogs and mire which hold water after high rainfall and release it slowly in times of drought. Basil Stow, an area ranger for the National Trust in Exmoor, added: “We are seeing damage across hundreds of acres of heather and on our neighbouring land. One of the unfortunate consequences of the heather suffering is that tougher plants such as molinia [moor grass] have chance to take hold. “Heather is a resilient plant and capable of regenerating from the rootstock or from seed – so we will need to watch and wait to see what happens next year but we are hopeful that it will recover with careful management.” Anne Gray, the director of the Heather Trust, echoed the concerns. She said: “One of our trustees told me just yesterday that he has been out on moorland in the north of England quite extensively in the last couple of weeks and had never seen beetle damage as bad as it is this year. It is worrying.” But she added the heather could recover. She said: “Though plants can look dead, they are often not and will recover if they get decent growing conditions in following years and are also not too severely attacked by beetles during those recovery years. Being careful to ensure they are not grazed too heavily during recovery will also help.”"

After celebrating at Twitter the passage of the symbolic climate emergency in the EU Parliament in Strasbourg on Thursday, parliamentarian Sven Giegold of the Green Party hops on a jet to Berlin!
We’ve all heard about the EU declaring a global climate emergency. Man has to profoundly alter its behavior if we are to have any hope of rescuing the planet.
Altering behaviour means not doing lots of convenient things like flying, eating meat, driving, heating with gas, coal or oil, consuming far less, taking vacations locally so as not to involve transportation by cruise ship, plane or automobile.
That’s what Europeans parliamentarians will be expecting of us.
Green hypocrites
It turns out that one of these parliamentarians is German Sven Giegold (50) of the Green Party. Last Thursday in Strasbourg Mr. Giegold voted in favor of the “climate emergency”, reports Germany’s Berliner Zeitung (BZ) here. Immediately he celebrated the Parliament’s decision on Twitter as an “important sign at the right time”.

Yes! Das Europaparlament ruft den #Klimanotstand aus! Ein wichtiges Zeichen zur richtigen Zeit. Es sind entscheidende Jahre für zukünftige Generationen! Ganz traurig: Große Teile der Christdemokraten haben dagegen gestimmt. #ClimateEmergency pic.twitter.com/Ml3bStr2UI
— Sven Giegold (@sven_giegold) November 28, 2019

Giegold’s tweet in English: “Yes! The European Parliament proclaims the #Climate crisis! An important sign at the right time. These are crucial years for future generations!
In his tweet, he also criticized the German CDU parliamentarians for not supporting the emergency declaration, adding: “Sadly, large sections of the Christian Democrats voted against. #Climate Emergency.”

238 kg of CO2 in a single afternoon
Giegold’s act alone of course comes as no surprise considering he’s from the Green Party. But the BZ then adds: “The problem: immediately after the meeting he got on the plane, flew to Frankfurt, from there to Berlin (CO2 footprint: 238 kilograms)”!
Obviously Giegold could not be bothered booking a train ride from Strasbourg to Berlin, which he demands of all other ordinary citizens.
Giegold’s glaring hypocrisy massively criticized 
According to the BZ, the “EU Green was caught at Tegel Airport and promptly caught a massive firestorm of criticism on the net.”
Giegold’s grand act of hypocrisy was called “a certain double standard” by German CDU politician Sven Schulze, who hit back at Giegold’s criticism of CDU parliamentarians’ votes against the measure: “Very sad colleague @sven_giegold is rather your #hypocrisy. In the morning in the #Europaparlament you proclaim the #Climate emergency and in the afternoon you take the plane for the short distance from Frankfurt to Berlin. (Didn’t the #greens want to ban these short flights?)”.
“Had to be in Berlin at 6 pm”
Indeed the German Greens are pushing for a ban of short domestic flights. Giegold, though, seems to believe he’s above all that.
According to German tabloid Bild here, Giegold insisted that he had no choice but to fly. Bild writes: “At 6 pm he had an appointment in the Federal Council. Giegold said: ‘In the evening I had the obligation to be in Berlin – at 6 pm. The vote in Strasbourg was over at 12.45 pm. It was impossible with the train.'”
“International and European policymaking impossible without flying”
“The flight was purely work-related, and not for private purposes,” said the Green EU parliamentarian. He added: “International and European policymaking are impossible without air transport. It is important that European democracy works,” Giegold continued.
Wow.

"Nearly every candidate that participated in CNN’s seven-hour climate town hall agreed that we need to invest trillions of dollars in building a clean energy economy fit for the 21st century, and create hundreds of thousands if not millions of jobs in the process. However impressive these commitments are, they won’t be worth much if they don’t also take on the fossil fuel industry. There was plenty of common ground to be found on Wednesday night, where candidates happily focused more on presenting their own visions than tearing down those of their opponents. On what to do with dirty energy companies, though, the differences couldn’t be starker.  As the Intercept’s Akela Lacy reported shortly before the debate, Joe Biden today is scheduled to attend a $2,800-a-head fundraiser hosted by Andrew Goldman, the co-founder of a company that specializes in opening up new markets for natural gas. Asked about that fact, Biden and his team went on the defense: technically Goldman is not involved in the day-to-day management of the company, and as such Biden fundraising off him doesn’t violate the terms of the Fossil Free Pledge activists pressured him to sign several months back, that he won’t take donations from the industry over $200. The Sunrise Movement – which has pressured candidates to take the pledge – has now called on Biden to cancel the event. A few minutes later, after a heated exchange about Goldman, Biden demurred on whether he would ban fracking and talked up the climate legacy of an Obama administration that oversaw the shale boom and the end of the ban on crude oil exports. Bernie Sanders, meanwhile, has pledged in his plan for a Green New Deal to make the fossil fuel industry enemy No 1, cutting into their business model and holding them accountable for the years they spent spreading misinformation about global warming. Elizabeth Warren rightly called out the fact that focusing on plastic straws and lightbulbs – as last night’s moderators at CNN insisted on doing – distracts from the fact that responsibility for this crisis is concentrated among a small number of corporations; just 90 companies – most of them fossil fuel producers – have been responsible for two-thirds of manmade greenhouse gas emissions since the dawn of the industrial age. There has been plenty of debate this cycle over candidates’ relative positions on nuclear energy, with policy wonks not unreasonably arguing that it could be risky to take that option off the table entirely. But any climate plan that doesn’t challenge the gargantuan power of the fossil fuel industry head-on is flatly denying several realities about our energy system. While the cost of renewables has plummeted over the last several years, their share of our energy mix has remained largely flat. Use of natural gas – what Amy Klobuchar called a “transitional” fuel – will need to decline 74% by mid-century, if we’re to take the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change seriously, but is poised to grow dramatically over the next several years via fresh development in the Permian and Appalachian basins. Building even prodigious amounts of clean power won’t stop that, or magically outcompete incumbent fuels. In short, there is nothing “inevitable” about the transition to renewables. The extended discussions about carbon pricing further left out the uncomfortable fact that – if that price isn’t high enough or complemented by stringent regulations – it could kill coal while driving business to big oil and gas companies not impacted by modest fees on pollution. That could trigger a massive build-out of dirty infrastructure, new long-term contracts could lock the world into an emissions that would make it virtually impossible to meet our climate goals – let along the hugely ambitious one of “well below 2C” outlined by the Paris climate agreement every candidate praised last night. What’s more, coal, oil and gas companies, along with investor-owned utilities, have spent millions of dollars to mislead the public about the existence of the climate crisis and blocking policies to curb it at every level of government. Just last year in Washington state, BP spent $13m in a successful attempt to kill a modest carbon tax – a proposal it theoretically supports. How do candidates think they will respond to their plans to create a carbon free America by mid-century at the latest? There’s no way around it: curbing the climate crisis means going to war with the fossil fuel industry – not attending their fundraisers.

Share this...FacebookTwitterDuring the winter of 2016-’17 nearly 25,000 Italian citizens died from the seasonal flu. No one blinked.
In well over 3 months since its purported inception, the COVID-19 virus is claimed to be responsible for less than 50,000 deaths globally (as of the 1st of April).
Every year, about 500,000 people from across the world die from the five-month-long seasonal flu.
During the last pandemic, the swine flu (H1N1) killed up to 575,000 people.
This was interestingly classified as “fairly mild” for total pandemic deaths in 2012 (ABC NEWS).

A closer look at Italy
A recent study (Rosano et al., 2019) indicates that 68,000 Italians died from the flu during the 2013-’14 to 2016-’17 flu seasons.
Specifically, there were 24,981 flu deaths in 2016-’17 and 20,259 seasonal flu fatalities occurred in 2014-’15.

These high death rates from the flu epidemic didn’t receive global attention.

Italy currently (1 April, 2020) has surpassed 13,100 deaths attributed to COVID-19 infections.
But it is highly likely the COVID-19 virus has been circulating throughout Italy for months, not weeks.
According to two Stanford medical professors, an entire Italian town of 3,300 was tested for the virus on the 6th of March (2020). 2.7% tests came back positive, which was 130 times greater an infection rate than the infection rate confirmed by that date.

What this means is the infection rate is perhaps two orders of magnitude more extensive than we know.
Accurate calculation of death rates can only be inferred from dividing the deaths by the total number of infected cases – not just the confirmed ones.
Consequently, the death rate from infection could be far lower than we currently imagine…on par with, or even lower than, the seasonal flu.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA commentary posted by Thomas Sigmund at the online German business daily “Handelsblatt” here warns of the consequences of introducing a CO2 tax in Germany.
https://www.handelsblatt.com/meinung/kommentare/kommentar-angela-merkel-ist-klimakanzlerin-fuer-einen-tag/25778402.html
The German greens and socialists have been calling for ramping up climate protection efforts as a way to reboot the economy in the wake of the COVID-19 economic meltdown and that the country should not return to its “old structures.”
The latest figures suggest Germany’s economy is starting its worst recession in its postwar history. 10.1 million people in Germany registered for reduced work hours by April 26, far beyond all the forecasts of economists.
Sigmund writes that going even more green and putting “further burdens” on the economy are not the answer. He writes that the climate protection plans drawn up earlier, in a time of full employment, “will not last” and that Chancellor Merkel “has even greater concerns at the moment.”
Would only exacerbate already deep recession 
“It is difficult to imagine that in this historic economic downturn further burdens will be imposed on companies,” Sigmund comments. “Those who continue to demand that CO2 emissions be priced are exacerbating the recession and torpedoing the planned economic stimulus package.”
A matter of “preventing mass unemployment”
Sigmund adds: “The shutdown gives us an idea of what industrialization means. It’s now a matter of preventing mass unemployment and not making the social explosives even bigger.”
At the Petersberg Climate Dialogue, an informal preparation for the UN Climate Summit in autumn – done via video link – Chancellor Angela Merkel said climate protection would not be pushed off the political agenda in the EU, and would be “just as much on the agenda as health issues”.

"Faced with a looming ferocious summer with little rain forecast, the New South Wales government has embarked on a Noah’s Ark type operation to move native fish from the Lower Darling – part of Australia’s most significant river system – to safe havens before high temperatures return to the already stressed river basin. Researchers have warned of other alarming ecological signs that the Lower Darling River – part of the giant Murray-Darling Basin – is in a dire state, following last summer’s mass fish kills. Professor Fran Sheldon, from Griffith University’s Australian Rivers Institute, said only one surviving colony of river mussels had been found along the river and there were signs that river red gums were under severe stress. “If the river red gums die, and some are hundreds of years old, there will be a domino effect. Banks will collapse, there will be massive erosion and it will send sediments down the river.” “These sort of ecological collapses are much harder and expensive to reverse,” she warned. The New South Wales government announced a $10m rescue package last week to mitigate the effects of the river crisis on native fish this summer. The NSW agriculture minister, Adam Marshall, said the unprecedented action would provide “a lifeline for key native species ahead of an expected summer of horror fish kills”. “We’re staring down the barrel of a potential fish Armageddon, which is why we’re wasting little time rolling out this unprecedented action,” Marshall said. “By starting this operation today we’re getting on the front foot while we still have the chance to rescue and relocate as many fish as possible.” Last December and January fish began dying in their hundreds of thousands in the far west of the state at Menindee, leaving weirs and waterholes carpeted with dead fish. While fish deaths have occurred in the past, the scale was unprecedented and stunned Australians. Several scientific reports said the lack of flow in the river due to the drought and exacerbated by irrigation upstream were to blame. When temperatures soared to over 40C and were followed by a cool change, the water in the pools stratified, leading to deoxygenation of the deeper water, killing fish. But there are already doubts about how effective the $10m program will be. The unprecedented operation aims to move as many fish as possible from 15 to 20 priority waterholes in a two-week period, including Murray cod, some of which are at least 25 years old, golden perch and other rare species. Boats with electrostatic fishing equipment will be used to stun the fish in weir pools and waterholes along the Darling at Menindee, where they will scooped up and loaded into special climate-controlled transport to a section of the Darling further south, near Wentworth, where the river joins the Murray, which is still flowing. Department of Primary Industries fisheries scientists are targeting fish contained within drying pools that are not expected to last through the summer. “By moving these fish, such as Murray cod and golden perch, we’re providing the best possible chance of survival,” Marshall said. • Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning But the government has not said how many fish it will move. One source told the Guardian it was hoped it would be in the hundreds. This is just a fraction of the population of the river and will not prevent the likelihood of further mass fish deaths during the coming summer. “It’s a photo-op rather than a real deal,” said a Menindee local, Graeme McCrabb, who has become a spokesman for the local community on the lower Darling. “There would be 10,000 cod between Weir 32 [at Menindee] and the Murray,” he said. “And silver perch, listed as a vulnerable species, are difficult to catch with electro fishing.” “If Lake Wetherill goes, there will be even more fish die than last year,” McCrabb warned. A program last summer to install aerators in larger waterholes near Menindee, which aimed to stir the water and restore oxygen, was only marginally successful due to the size of the pools and the vast length of the river. Meanwhile, the NSW government appears to be in denial about possible causes of the ecological catastrophe last summer. The water minister, Melinda Pavey, has criticised her own independent adviser, the NSW Natural Resources Commission, which said extractions by irrigators upstream may have led to the Lower Darling being pushed into hydrological drought three years earlier than it otherwise would have been. The commission has called for an urgent revision of the rules that allow irrigators to continue to extract from the river when flows are very low. It wants the threshold when irrigators must cease to take water from the river to be raised, along with other rule changes. “The NRC report was one of a number that has given advice on this issue,” said Sheldon, who contributed to the report. “It’s a contentious issue. We just raised the question: have [the extraction rules] influenced the conditions that have led to the catastrophic drying of the Barwon-Darling?” “If the answer is that extractions did contribute, then the answer is straightforward: we need to change the rules. “If they didn’t, then the answer is a whole lot more complex. We need to understand what is really going on.” “The fish rescue program will preserve some genetic diversity, but the government also needs to monitor the surrounding ecosystems, as [returning] fish would not survive if mussels and other invertebrates are lost,” she said. The government said the fish would be able to migrate back up the 500km of the Darling when the drought ended. “When flows do return to normal, the fish will be able to migrate to their ‘homes’ back upstream, without the need for additional intervention,” Marshall said. • On 10 September 2019 this article was amended. A previous version said water in pools “striated” when “stratified” was meant."
