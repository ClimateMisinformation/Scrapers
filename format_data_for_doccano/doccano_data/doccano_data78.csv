"Humanity’s impact on the Earth is now so profound that a new geological epoch – the Anthropocene – needs to be declared, according to an official expert group who presented the recommendation to the International Geological Congress in Cape Town on Monday. The new epoch should begin about 1950, the experts said, and was likely to be defined by the radioactive elements dispersed across the planet by nuclear bomb tests, although an array of other signals, including plastic pollution, soot from power stations, concrete, and even the bones left by the global proliferation of the domestic chicken were now under consideration. The current epoch, the Holocene, is the 12,000 years of stable climate since the last ice age during which all human civilisation developed. But the striking acceleration since the mid-20th century of carbon dioxide emissions and sea level rise, the global mass extinction of species, and the transformation of land by deforestation and development mark the end of that slice of geological time, the experts argue. The Earth is so profoundly changed that the Holocene must give way to the Anthropocene. “The significance of the Anthropocene is that it sets a different trajectory for the Earth system, of which we of course are part,” said Prof Jan Zalasiewicz, a geologist at the University of Leicester and chair of the Working Group on the Anthropocene (WGA), which started work in 2009. “If our recommendation is accepted, the Anthropocene will have started just a little before I was born,” he said. “We have lived most of our lives in something called the Anthropocene and are just realising the scale and permanence of the change.” Prof Colin Waters, principal geologist at the British Geological Survey and WGA secretary, said: “Being able to pinpoint an interval of time is saying something about how we have had an incredible impact on the environment of our planet. The concept of the Anthropocene manages to pull all these ideas of environmental change together.” Prof Chris Rapley, a climate scientist at University College London and former director of the Science Museum in London said: “The Anthropocene marks a new period in which our collective activities dominate the planetary machinery.  “Since the planet is our life support system – we are essentially the crew of a largish spaceship – interference with its functioning at this level and on this scale is highly significant. If you or I were crew on a smaller spacecraft, it would be unthinkable to interfere with the systems that provide us with air, water, fodder and climate control. But the shift into the Anthropocene tells us that we are playing with fire, a potentially reckless mode of behaviour which we are likely to come to regret unless we get a grip on the situation.” Rapley is not part of the WGA. Martin Rees, the astronomer royal and former president of the Royal Society, said that the dawn of the Anthropocene was a significant moment. “The darkest prognosis for the next millennium is that bio, cyber or environmental catastrophes could foreclose humanity’s immense potential, leaving a depleted biosphere,” he said.  But Lord Rees added that there is also cause for optimism. “Human societies could navigate these threats, achieve a sustainable future, and inaugurate eras of post-human evolution even more marvellous than what’s led to us. The dawn of the Anthropocene epoch would then mark a one-off transformation from a natural world to one where humans jumpstart the transition to electronic (and potentially immortal) entities, that transcend our limitations and eventually spread their influence far beyond the Earth.” The evidence of humanity’s impact on the planet is overwhelming, but the changes are very recent in geological terms, where an epoch usually spans tens of millions of years. “One criticism of the Anthropocene as geology is that it is very short,” said Zalasiewicz. “Our response is that many of the changes are irreversible.” To define a new geological epoch, a signal must be found that occurs globally and will be incorporated into deposits in the future geological record. For example, the extinction of the dinosaurs 66m years ago at the end of the Cretaceous epoch is defined by a “golden spike” in sediments around the world of the metal iridium, which was dispersed from the meteorite that collided with Earth to end the dinosaur age. For the Anthropocene, the best candidate for such a golden spike are radioactive elements from nuclear bomb tests, which were blown into the stratosphere before settling down to Earth. “The radionuclides are probably the sharpest – they really come on with a bang,” said Zalasiewicz. “But we are spoiled for choice. There are so many signals.” Other spikes being considered as evidence of the onset of the Anthropocene include the tough, unburned carbon spheres emitted by power stations. “The Earth has been smoked, with signals very clearly around the world in the mid-20th century,” said Zalasiewicz. Other candidates include plastic pollution, aluminium and concrete particles, and high levels of nitrogen and phosphate in soils, derived from artificial fertilisers. Although the world is currently seeing only the sixth mass extinction of species in the 700m-year history of complex life on Earth, this is unlikely to provide a useful golden spike as the animals are by definition very rare and rarely dispersed worldwide. In contrast, some species have with human help spread rapidly across the world. The domestic chicken is a serious contender to be a fossil that defines the Anthropocene for future geologists. “Since the mid-20th century, it has become the world’s most common bird. It has been fossilised in thousands of landfill sites and on street corners around the world,” said Zalasiewicz. “It is is also a much bigger bird with a different skeleton than its prewar ancestor.”  The 35 scientists on the WGA – who voted 30 to three in favour of formally designating the Anthropocene, with two abstentions – will now spend the next two to three years determining which signals are the strongest and sharpest. Crucially, they must also decide a location which will define the start of the Anthropocene. Geological divisions are not defined by dates but by a specific boundary between layers of rock or, in the case of the Holocene, a boundary between two ice layers in a core taken from Greenland and now stored in Denmark. The scientists are focusing on sites where annual layers are formed and are investigating mud sediments off the coast of Santa Barbara in California and the Ernesto cave in northern Italy, where stalactites and stalagmites accrete annual rings. Lake sediments, ice cores from Antarctica, corals, tree rings and even layers of rubbish in landfill sites are also being considered. Once the data has been assembled, it will be formally submitted to the stratigraphic authorities and the Anthropocene could be officially adopted within a few years. “If we were very lucky and someone came forward with, say, a core from a classic example of laminated sediments in a deep marine environment, I think three years is possibly viable,” said Zalasiewicz.  This would be lightning speed for such a geological decision, which in the past would have taken decades and even centuries to make. The term Anthropocene was coined only in 2000, by the Nobel prize-winning scientist Paul Crutzen, who believes the name change is overdue. He said in 2011: “This name change stresses the enormity of humanity’s responsibility as stewards of the Earth.” Crutzen also identified in 2007 what he called the “great acceleration” of human impacts on the planet from the mid-20th century.  Despite the WGA’s expert recommendation, the declaration of the Anthropocene is not yet a foregone conclusion. “Our stratigraphic colleagues are very protective of the geological time scale. They see it very rightly as the backbone of geology and they do not amend it lightly,” said Zalasiewicz. “But I think we can prepare a pretty good case.” Rapley also said there was a strong case: “It is highly appropriate that geologists should pay formal attention to a change in the signal within sedimentary rock layers that will be clearly apparent to future generations of geologists for as long as they exist. The ‘great acceleration’ constitutes a strong, detectable and incontrovertible signal.” Human activity has:"
"Brexit support and climate denial have many similarities. Many Brexit Leave campaign leaders also deny the dangers of human-caused climate change. Older generations were more likely to vote for the UK to leave the EU and are more likely to oppose taking action on climate change; younger generations disagree, and will be forced to live with the consequences of those decisions. On both issues there’s also a dangerous strain of anti-intellectualism, in which campaigners mock experts and dismiss their evidence and conclusions. With Brexit, the Leave campaign won the vote, and the UK economy is already feeling the consequences. As Graham Readfearn reported, a new group called “Clexit” (Climate Exit) has formed in an effort to similarly withdraw countries from the successful international climate treaty forged last year in Paris. As the group describes itself:  Brexit was Britain’s answer to the growing over-reach of EU bureaucracies. Clexit is our answer to the push for global control through climate hysteria. Clexit leaders are heavily involved in tobacco and fossil fuel-funded organizations, in what’s become known as “the web of denial.” The group’s president is Christopher Monckton, whose extensive misunderstanding of basic climate science was revealed in a thorough debunking by John Abraham, and who insists that President Obama was born in Kenya, among his many controversial and conspiratorial public statements. Its vice president is Marc Morano, who began his career working for Rush Limbaugh and is essentially the real-life version of the character Nick Naylor from the film Thank You for Smoking. Its secretary is Viv Forbes, who has been involved with coal industry for over 40 years and is associated with many fossil fuel-funded groups. With feedback from the rest of the group’s members, Forbes prepared Clexit’s summary statement, which is full of myths and misinformation about economics, energy, laws, and climate science. It includes this expression of compassionate concern over the plight of low-lying island nations that are being engulfed by rising seas: Some of the biggest supporters of the Paris accord are small oceanic nations seeking welfare through handouts to save them from baseless predictions of rising sea levels, even though actual changes in sea levels are tiny and not unusual. The fact is that sea level rise in Tuvalu has been effectively zero since accurate measurements commenced in 1993, on tide gauges set up by the Australian government This purported fact is actually a fiction: the tide gauge data show the rate of sea level rise in Tuvalu since 1993 is 4.3 mm per year, which is faster than the global average of 3.4 mm per year. And Tuvalu is only one among the many small island nations facing the loss of their homelands at the hands of global warming-caused sea level rise. However, when it comes to energy use, Clexit’s compassion for developing countries becomes even clearer yet: For developing countries, the Paris Treaty would deny them the benefits of reliable low-cost hydrocarbon energy, compelling them to rely on biomass heating and costly weather-dependent and unreliable power supplies, thus prolonging and increasing their dependency on international handouts. They will soon resent being told to remain forever in an energy-deprived wind/solar/wood/bicycle economy.  The problem with energy from burning fossil fuels is that it’s only “low-cost” if we ignore the tremendous costs of the damages its carbon pollution causes via climate change. Poorer countries are particularly vulnerable to those costs, both because they lack the wealth and resources to adapt to them, and because they tend to be located in already-hot geographic regions near the equator.  There’s a reason why 95% of expert economists agree that we should cut carbon pollution. Of course, the Clexiters deny that carbon dioxide is a pollutant: Carbon dioxide is NOT a dangerous pollutant – it is a natural, non-toxic and beneficial gas which feeds all life on earth. However, this was long ago decided in the courts. In 2007, the US Supreme Court ruled that the State of Massachusetts had legal standing to sue the EPA for its refusal to regulate greenhouse gases, specifically because Massachusetts showed that it was being harmed by global warming via sea level rise encroaching on its shores. In that case, the Supreme Court ruled that carbon dioxide is a pollutant. In response to the Supreme Court decision, the EPA issued an endangerment finding concluding that, based on the available scientific evidence, carbon dioxide endangers public health and welfare, and must therefore be regulated as a pollutant. The Clexiters deny that vast body of scientific evidence. In addition to sea level rise, their summary statement denies the major role of carbon dioxide in the Earth’s greenhouse effect, that current global temperatures are hotter than they’ve been in over 2,000 years, the dangers of ongoing climate change, that most climate scientists were predicting global warming in the 1970s, and so on. It’s perhaps unsurprising that the Clexit group denies basic climate science, since the only climate scientist on their committee is Ole Humlum, who has done some very shoddy research on fossil fuels and carbon pollution. The group effectively asks that we all reject the conclusions of 97% of climate science experts and 95% of economics experts, in favor of the myths and misinformation propagated by their fake experts. Perhaps, as top Leave campaigner Michael Gove said:  people in this country have had enough of experts Gove also pushed to remove climate change from school curriculums, before backing down.  Fortunately, given the high level of global concern about climate change, Clexit faces a much tougher road to success than Brexit, because a Clexit victory would be a disaster for the rest of us."
"Australia will blow its carbon budget with either the Coalition’s emissions reduction targets, or those suggested by the Labor opposition, highlighting the urgent need for negative-emissions technology, analysis commissioned by the Climate Institute shows. “Everyone is just now beginning to work out the implications of the 1.5C goal, and how hard it is to get to it,” said John Connor, chief executive of the Climate Institute.  The report found that while the policy measures needed to keep global warming to 1.5C or 2C were similar, the risks and costs associated with letting global temperatures reach 2C would be “unmanageable”. Global warming of 1.5C would make rare events such as extreme heat waves and coral bleaching the new normal, but 2C of warming would move the world into “uncharted territory”, the report by Climate Analytics found. “Essentially, we are saying that achieving emissions reduction targets will require transformation,” Connor said. “Not achieving them will require even greater transformation as we struggle to cope with the growing climate impacts.” For Australia to cut its emissions in line with either target, it will almost certainly need to achieve negative emissions towards 2050. But if the country follows its current targets to 2030 (26% to 28% below 2005 levels) it will then need to make devastating cuts, dropping to zero emissions within five years to stay within the carbon budget. Even on the plan Labor took the election, which involved a cut to 45% below 2005 levels by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2050, will blow the carbon budget by 15%, the report found. It said that “some level of negative emissions is virtually unavoidable at this stage, even with very rapid emissions reductions between now and 2050”. An earlier Climate Institute report, the group found technology such as bioenergy combined with carbon capture and storage could play a role in removing 65m tonnes of CO2 annually by 2050. The report argues that a carbon-budget approach should be taken by policymakers, rather than simply focusing on an emissions target for a particular year: “Australia’s contribution to limiting warming to 1.5C-2C is determined by cumulative emissions, not emissions in a single year.” The report noted that decarbonisation of the electricity sector should be the biggest priority, since it is the biggest contributor to emissions. Doing that would also allow emissions in transport and other sectors to be cut by electrifying them. For the world to achieve the more ambitious 1.5C goal, the strategies would be the same but would just need to occur faster. It said doing it faster would cost between 1.5 times and twice as much, but “the benefits would be vast”. Warming of 2C would destroy almost all tropical coral around the world, but keeping warming to 1.5C could save 10% of coral cover. And 2C of warming would increase heatwave days in northern Australia by 60 a year; the lower target would save 20 of those days from such hot weather. The stronger target would also have dramatic impacts on water availability and sea level rise. Connor said the government’s review of climate policies, which will occur next year, is an opportunity to create bipartisan support for credible targets. “It will quite possibly be the first credible national climate policy conversation for five years or so,” he said. For Australia to start moving towards an emissions goal that is consistent with the commitments made in Paris last year, the Climate Institute called for three broad actions. First, a pathway to zero emissions needed to be designed, and it needed to get Australia to zero emissions well before 2050. Second, it called for climate and energy policies to be fully integrated so that coal power can be phased out and businesses can invest with confidence in renewable energy. Finally, it called for Australia to take the lead from business and defence agencies around the world that were integrating climate costs and opportunities into their everyday decision making. That should involve a “national adaptation strategy”, it said."
"James Webb huddled on the hill with his dog and watched the fire advance, the flames licking through the cherry trees, the oak trees, the peach trees, then swaying just short of his home, the last home left in this part of the valley. “We’ve been praying all day long, hoping for the best. I believe it’s working because our house is still standing even though everything around it has been burnt,” said the 20-year-old student. “It’s almost like a miracle.” It was sunset on Tuesday, just 32 hours since the fire began in the Cajon Pass, and as far as the eye could see, desolation. Canyons and ridges, orchards and scrub, trails and houses, all aflame or already ash.  Young Kim, 72, a Christian pastor, hunkered beside Webb. Wearing a mask against the smoke, he spoke not of a miracle but a test of faith, calling the destruction an augury: “We are approaching the end of the world.” Not exactly. This was a 25,000-acre patch of California going up in smoke, as large patches of California do every summer and autumn, which is why it’s called fire season. Fires are not only inevitable, they can benefit the landscape by purging undergrowth and regenerating ecosystems. They are natural.  But the fire currently ripping through this collection of rural communities in San Bernardino county, 60 miles east of Los Angeles, does not seem normal and certainly not beneficial to humans or nature. In a matter of hours it cut major roads and forced the evacuation of more than 80,000 people in an abrupt, panicked exodus. The speed astonished seasoned fire fighters. They have seen big, fast, wild conflagrations before, such as the 2013 Rim fire in northern California, but the Blue Cut fire raced through the landscape with alarming velocity. The smoke is visible from Las Vegas, Huntington Beach – and space. “It hit hard, it hit fast – it hit with an intensity that we haven’t seen before,” said San Bernardino County fire chief Mark Hartwig. “There will be a lot of families that will come home to nothing.”  Mike Wakowski, the incident commander who is managing the 1,600 firefighters on the ground and fleets of air tankers and helicopters, said in 40 years of fighting fires he had never seen a fire behave this way. Glenn Barley, the San Bernardino unit chief of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, said Blue Cut and other recent blazes were scorching the landscape in unprecedented ways. “It’s to the point where explosive fire growth is the new normal this year, and that’s a challenge for all of us to take on.” The fire started soon after 10am on Tuesday – the cause is still being investigated – near the Blue Cut trail, giving the fire its name. It crackled across five acres, then 50, then 500, racing towards hamlets and towns along the Cajon Pass. The terrain acted as a funnel, whipping 30mph winds through walls of flame which leaped the I-15, an interstate highway.  Authorities scrambled to warn and evacuate the scattered population, phoning, wailing sirens, hammering on doors. Word that flames had consumed the Summit Inn, a historic diner along Route 66, helped focus minds.  Families grabbed what they could – pets, photo albums, jewelry – and piled into cars and trucks only to find highways cut off, forcing many onto clogged back mountain routes like Sheep Creek Road. They found refuge in cafes, high schools, churches and Red Cross shelters. By Wednesday morning the fire had grown to cover more than 40 square miles and was “0% contained” – firefight-speak for raging out of control. Yet it emerged that many residents had stayed put.  “This is not the time to mess around,” San Bernardino County fire department battalion chief Mark Peeble said into TV cameras. “If we ask you to leave, you have to leave,” said Wakoski, the incident commander. A few hours later the Guardian found Lou Asztalos, 53, gathering leaves and hosing shrubs at a camper van site in Lytle Creek, a mountain community on the fire’s south-western flank. Flames danced on a nearby ridge, billowing smoke into a sky buzzing with helicopters and air-tankers.  Asztalos shrugged off the mandatory evacuation order. “I want to check everything here’s OK. I’ve got a hose.” When the power cut, reducing the flow to a trickle, he conceded possibly leaving. “Burning to death, no thanks. There’s a limit to my stupidity.” The fire has burned through rural communities with alarming velocity not seen before, possibly due to California’s drier winters, warmer springs and hotter summers. “Climate change is real and it is with us,” Robert Bonnie, undersecretary for natural resources and environment at the US Department of Agriculture, told the Guardian in February. “The whole US Forest Service is shifting to becoming an agency dominated by wildfires. We really are at a tipping point. The current situation is not sustainable.” This is news to some of those caught up in the Blue Cut fire, many of them political conservatives. “Climate change? A farce. I’ve been here since 1996 and it’s been the same: it gets hot in summer and the place burns,” said Rich Kerr, mayor of Adelanto.  Ryan Gilmore, 21, and Sonya Haffner, 42, “horse people” from Riverside, drove overnight on their own dime to help residents evacuate animals. “This,” said Haffner, indicating the smoke, “is just a hot period. It’ll go back eventually.” Gilmore agreed. “The world goes through cycles. Global warming is a bunch of crap.” He flicked some ash from his shoulder. “It’s just another excuse for people to whine about something.” By early Thursday officials reported some progress: the fire was 4% contained."
"“When the earth burps, Law Dome records it,” says Australian climate scientist Dr David Etheridge. Law Dome is a special spot in eastern Antarctica where scientists have been drilling down into the continent’s long-frozen surface to pull out cores of ice. Trapped in the ice cores are bubbles that give a record of the composition of the Earth’s atmosphere going back tens of thousands of years. New analysis of those bubbles by a group of Australian, British and Italian scientists could have just given an answer to a crucial question. As the Earth gets warmer, how will the planet’s soils and plants react? Will they start to “burp” too much CO2 and, if so, how much?  Answering this question is crucial as scientists try and work out just how much more greenhouse gases humans can afford to emit while still keeping to temperature targets agreed at the Paris climate talks last year. The new ice core analysis, published in the journal Nature Geoscience, suggests the news is less than encouraging.  The research finds that for every 1C of warming, the Earth’s plants and soils – the “terrestrial biosphere” – will add carbon dioxide to the atmosphere to the tune of about 20 parts per million. Levels in the atmosphere continue to climb. But to arrive at this number, the scientific team went back to analyse bubbles trapped in the ice during the Little Ice Age (LIA) – a period which started around the year 1500 and lasted for about 250 years.  The ice cores used in the study were drilled from the late 1980s to the mid 2000s and are stored near CSIRO’s Aspendale lab in Victoria and at the Australian Antarctic Division in Tasmania. The study also used data from ice cores drilled by the British Antarctic Survey 20 years ago. Etheridge, a principal research scientist at CSIRO and co-author of the new research, has been to Antarctica seven times and is a veteran of ice core drilling programs.  Working temperatures for scientists at Law Dome can range from a balmy minus 5C (Etheridge claims T-shirts are worn. I don’t believe him) to a blustery -20C to a clear but frigid 50 degrees below freezing (that’s -58F). During the LIA, temperatures globally cooled by a half degree Celsius or so and the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere dropped. Etheridge says: “Before the industrial revolution there were changes in the global temperature and we have observations of that from the ice cores. This Little Ice Age was a natural event triggered probably by volcanoes going off and a slightly weaker sun.”  Scientists have known that atmospheric CO2 dropped during the LIA, but were not sure why.  One theory was that as pandemics swept through the Americas and Europe, this reduced the amount of farming activity. In turn, the regrowth sucked more CO2 back into soils and plants. But by analysing another compound trapped in ice cores – carbonyl sulfide – the scientists were able to show it was the falling temperatures, rather than the regrowth of plants, that caused the terrestrial biosphere to suck up more CO2 (and in turn, cut atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide).  If this were to operate at this level in the future it would significantly reduce the available carbon budget On the flip side, this now means that as the planet warms, the Earth’s plants and soils will likely store less carbon and help push up CO2 levels in the atmosphere. Essentially, Etheridge and his colleagues have found that the Earth’s terrestrial biosphere acts as a “positive feedback” in the climate system as global warming continues.  “More warming, leads to more CO2 from the terrestrial biosphere, which leads to more warming,” says Etheridge.  Etheridge explained there was some good and bad news from the study.  The good news was that the findings suggested that some of the worse predictions of a potential feedback from plants and soils were probably now ruled out. “We now have a number to work with,” he said. But the bad news was that the “positive feedback” was now confirmed, ruling out other studies that had predicted lower amounts of CO2 being released from the terrestrial biosphere, or not released at all. This flow of carbon between the Earth’s atmosphere and its plants and soils is a vital issue for scientists to understand.  Scientists have started to set “budgets” for the amount of carbon dioxide that can be released by humans while still have a shot at keeping warming well below 2C.  If the terrestrial biosphere adds more CO2 to the system than models anticipate, then this could mean governments around the world have less in that carbon budget than they thought.  Climate scientist Dr Bill Hare, founder of the respected group Climate Analytics, has been a key adviser to governments and the United Nations on carbon budgets.  I asked him for his view on the Nature Geoscience paper, which he described as “elegant” (I’ve found this is a word scientists often use when they’re mightily impressed with someone else’s work).  Hare said: “The paper shows a significant positive feedback from warming on the terrestrial carbon cycle. If this were to operate at this level in the future it would significantly reduce the available carbon budget for fossil fuel CO2 emissions, compared to present mid range estimates.”  Hare said the findings would “tend to push the budgets towards the lower range of the estimates available at present”. “If there is a positive feedback as the authors calculate, this would only add to the urgency of reducing emissions as rapidly as possible in order to minimise that feedback and to minimise the impact on the remaining carbon budget.”  Roughly translated, all of this means that ice bubbles from the frigid Antarctic have just made the job of cutting fossil fuel emissions even more urgent."

"The historic and devastating floods in Louisiana are the latest in a series of heavy deluges that some climate scientists warn will become even more common as the world continues to warm. On Tuesday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) is set to classify the Louisiana disaster as the eighth flood considered to be a once-in-every-500-years event to have taken place in the US in little over 12 months.   Since May of last year, dozens of people have been killed and thousands of homes have been swamped with water in extreme events in Oklahoma, Texas, South Carolina, West Virginia and Maryland. Noaa considers these floods extreme because, based on historical rainfall records, they should be expected to occur only once every 500 years. The Louisiana flooding has been so exceptional that some places in the state experienced storm conditions considered once-every-1,000-year events. Close to 2ft of rain fell over a 48-hour period in parts of southern Louisiana, causing residents to scramble to safety from flooded homes and cars.  At least six people have died, with another 20,000 people having to be rescued. Even Louisiana governor John Bel Edwards had to evacuate after his governor’s mansion in Baton Rouge was swamped with chest-high water. A federal state of emergency has been declared, with 12,000 people crowding into shelters.  The National Weather Service balloon released in New Orleans on Friday showed near-record levels of atmospheric moisture, prompting the service to state: “We are in record territory.” Climate scientists have warned that the build-up of moisture in the atmosphere, driven by warming temperatures, is likely to cause a greater number of floods in the future. “We have been on an upward trend in terms of heavy rainfall events over the past two decades, which is likely related to the amount of water vapor going up in the atmosphere,” said Dr Kenneth Kunkel, of the Cooperative Institute for Climate and Satellites.  “There’s a very tight loop – as surface temperatures of the oceans warm up, the immediate response is more water vapor in the atmosphere. We’re in a system inherently capable of producing more floods.” The number of heavy rainfall events in the US has risen well above the long-term average since the 1990s, with large regional variances. While the north-east, midwest and upper great plains have experienced a 30% increase in heavy rainfall episodes – considered once-in-every-five year downpours – parts of the west, particularly California, have been parched by drought. Warmer air, influenced by heat-trapping gases released by human activity, can contain more water vapor than cooler air. With the extra heat helping nourish storms, scientists expect global warming to help produce more intense downpours.  “Assuming we don’t change our ways, warming is a virtual certainty and increased water vapor is virtual certainty,” Kunkel said. “That means increases in heavy rainfall is virtual certainty.” While scientists are loathe to attribute any single event to changes in the climate, they state that warming temperatures are helping tip the scales towards altered precipitation. Some, however, bristle at the belief that because floods and storms have always occurred, they should not be linked to climate change.  Dr Kevin Trenberth, senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said the major floods seen in the US had a “clear human component in them. I have seen only a few reports and none mention climate change at all. It is pathetic.” There are plenty of influences on rainfall levels, including natural variation and topography. One of the biggest variables will be how much warmer the world will become – Trenberth said each 1C increase in temperature can add 7% more moisture in the atmosphere. But plotting exact projections between warming and the magnitude of downpours is something scientists are still working on. “Changes in the global water cycle in response to the warming over the 21st century will not be uniform,” states the latest IPCC assessment. “The contrast in precipitation between wet and dry regions and between wet and dry seasons will increase, although there may be regional exceptions.” With the US suffering more weather-related disasters than any other country, an increase in rainfall, storm and hurricane intensity is something that could start demanding more attention from lawmakers. “It’s prudent to consider that if you’re building something with a 100-year lifetime, it’s virtually certain that it will experience an increase in extreme rainfall,” Kunkel said. “We either pay now or pay later. If we build resiliency into infrastructure, we can protect life and property.”"
"What is salient is not important. What is important is not salient. The media turns us away from the issues that will determine the course of our lives, and towards topics of brain-melting irrelevance.  This, on current trends, will be the hottest year ever measured. The previous record was set in 2015; the one before in 2014. Fifteen of the 16 warmest years have occurred in the 21st century. Each of the past 14 months has beaten the global monthly temperature record. But you can still hear people repeating the old claim, first proposed by fossil fuel lobbyists, that global warming stopped in 1998. Arctic sea ice covered a smaller area last winter than in any winter since records began. In Siberia, an anthrax outbreak is raging through the human and reindeer populations because infected corpses locked in permafrost since the last epidemic in 1941 have thawed. India has been hammered by cycles of drought and flood, as withering heat parches the soil and torches glaciers in the Himalayas. Southern and eastern Africa have been pitched into humanitarian emergencies by drought. Wildfires storm across America; coral reefs around the world are bleaching and dying. Throughout the media, these tragedies are reported as impacts of El Niño: a natural weather oscillation caused by blocks of warm water forming in the Pacific. But the figures show that it accounts for only one-fifth of the global temperature rise. The El Niño phase has now passed, but still the records fall. Eight months ago in Paris, 177 nations promised to try to ensure the world’s average temperature did not rise by more than 1.5C above the pre-industrial level. Already it has climbed by 1.3C – faster and further than almost anyone predicted. In one respect, the scientists were wrong. They told us to expect a climate crisis in the second half of this century. But it’s already here. If you blinked you would have missed the reports, but perhaps the most striking aspect of the Democratic platform (the party’s manifesto) approved in Philadelphia last week was its position on climate change. Hillary Clinton’s campaign now promises a national and global mobilisation “on a scale not seen since World War II”. She will seek to renegotiate trade deals to protect the living world, to stop oil drilling in the Arctic and Atlantic, and to ensure the US is “running entirely on clean energy by mid-century”. There are some crashing contradictions in the platform. To judge by one bizarre paragraph, the Democrats believe they can solve climate change by expanding roads and airports. It boasts about record sales in the car industry and promises to cut “red tape”, which is the term used by corporate lobbyists for the public protections they hate. But where it is good it is very good, reflecting the influence of Bernie Sanders and the nominees he proposed to the drafting committee. Donald Trump, on the other hand – well, what did you expect? Climate change is a “con-job” and a “hoax” that was “created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive”. His manifesto reads like a love letter to the coal industry. Coal, it says, “is an abundant, clean, affordable, reliable domestic energy resource”. He will defend the industry by rejecting the Paris agreement, stopping funds for the UN’s climate change work, ditching President Obama’s clean power plan and forbidding the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating carbon dioxide. What’s most alarming about the platform is that Trump didn’t write it: the deranged and contradictory bluster of the Republican party leadership is a collective effort. But at least it clears something up. Though boasting of his great wealth and power, he poses as the friend of the common citizen and the enemy of corporate capital. On every significant issue in the manifesto, corporate capital wins. To read it is to discover how the land lies and where the lies land. Incidentally, Trump’s executives don’t share his belief that climate change is a hoax. His golf resort in Ireland is seeking permission to build a wall – not to keep out Mexicans, but to defend his business from rising sea levels, erosion and storm surges caused, the application says, by global warming. If you can buy your way out of trouble, who cares about the other 7 billion? It’s not that the media failed to mention what the two platforms said about humanity’s existential crisis. But the coverage was, for the most part, relegated to footnotes, while the evanescent trivia of the conventions led the bulletins and filled the front pages. There are many levels of bias in the media, but the most important is the bias against relevance. In Britain, the media largely failed to hold David Cameron to account for his extravagant green promises and shocking record as prime minister. His successor, Theresa May, has made some terrible appointments, but the new climate change minister, Nick Hurd, an adult among her pet buffoons, is an interesting choice as he seems to understand the subject. The basic problem, however, is that the political costs of failure are so low. To pretend that newspapers and television channels are neutral arbiters of such matters is to ignore their place at the corrupt heart of the establishment. At the US conventions, to give one small example, the Washington Post, the Atlantic and Politico were paid by the American Petroleum Institute to host a series of discussions, at which climate science deniers were represented. The pen might be mightier than the sword, but the purse is mightier than the pen. Why should we trust multinational corporations to tell us the truth about multinational corporations? And if they cannot properly inform us about the power in which they are embedded, how can they properly inform us about anything? If humanity fails to prevent climate breakdown, the industry that bears the greatest responsibility is not transport, farming, gas, oil or even coal. All of them can behave as they do, shunting us towards systemic collapse, only with a social licence to operate. The problem begins with the industry that, wittingly or otherwise, grants them this licence: the one for which I work. • A fully referenced version of this article can be found at monbiot.com.

"For years the Los Angeles-based artist Lars Jan was haunted by an image he just couldn’t shake: “A man is turning the pages of a newspaper and slowly the room fills with water. Rather than reacting like there’s anything out of the ordinary, he just keeps on turning the pages until water rises over his head, the paper is submerged and the pages disintegrate in his hands.”   Jan’s performance installation, Holoscenes, is remarkably faithful to this unsettling vision. Performers occupy a plastic chamber that fills with water while they go about everyday tasks, submitted by members of the public from all over the world. As each performer puts on makeup, drinks coffee or pretends to sell fruit, a pump pushes up to 3,500 gallons of water into their tank in less than a minute, creating an effect rather like a flash-flood – if that flood were confined to an elevator. Ever since Hurricane Katrina, Jan noticed footage of people in moving water started to affect him powerfully. “It really grips me and pulls me into their story,” he says. As a longtime fan of the California light and space movement (and its most famous proponent James Turrell), he wondered whether, instead of using light to manipulate an environment, he could use water to choreograph the human form. The result is part surrealist performance, part sculpture, part escapology-style spectacle. The figure inside the tank could be cleaning the windows one minute and totally submerged, floating upside down the next. And that title? It refers to the geological period that began at the end of the pleistocene era about 10,000 years ago. Evidence suggests that with global warming the planet is now entering a new era, sometimes referred to as the anthropocene: an epoch whose conditions have been shaped by human activity. If this is so, it will be the first time in the history of the planet that a living species will have impacted the environment in this way. The defining features of the anthropocene era would be an abnormally high level of CO2 in the atmosphere, and its corollary, rising sea levels. “There’s just so much data,” says Jan. “It occurred to me that one way I could respond to this complex load of information was to make a moving bar graph.” During Art Basel, Jan was approached by a young Cuban immigrant who had recently arrived in the US. She was an aspiring actor working three jobs, one of them cleaning windows. “She identified with the performer in the chamber. She wanted to know if she was swimming in her own tears.” He also felt compelled to intervene in a three-way argument between a group of children over whether the piece was about dreams, mermaids or death. “They were all right,” he says. Jan admits to a phobia of deep water. Perhaps it’s this fear, so common and so ancient, that leaves audience members surprised by the intensity of their own reactions. “People get really worried for us,” says Annie Saunders, one of the performers, “They feel this enormous anxiety about the water: that it keeps coming. Or it never goes away.”  Spectators needn’t feel too guilty. The water is kept at skin temperature and Saunders insists she loves the experience. “We do a lot of very long exhalations, so we can sink to the bottom of the tank. And that puts your body in a very zen state. So we’re really blissed out in there.” Being submerged for an extended period flips a primordial, water-mammalian switch, she says. “For the first 10 minutes, we just look like people in water, and then, around 10 minutes in, something just shifts. As a viewer, you forget that we have to breathe.” Having travelled to Toronto, Miami and Sarasota, Holoscenes will be coming to London as part of London’s Burning, an arts festival marking the 350th anniversary of the Great Fire of London. Jan suggests there is a rightness to commemorating the fire with a performance that not only explores our fraught relationship with its elemental opposite but embodies our adaptability.  “What’s the global Great Fire?” he asks. “What is the coming disaster that we need to organise around and adapt to?” Although the possibility of fire was obvious to some 17th-century observers, it took a catastrophe to change people’s behaviour. It makes you wonder if we’ll still be cleaning the windows as the waters rise."
"At the Paris climate talks last December, governments agreed to work towards limiting global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. But the topic of financing developing countries to help them adapt to climate change and transition to clean energy became a sticking point during the negotiations. We recently brought together a panel of experts to debate how developing countries can reach 100% renewables. Here’s what we learned:  The falling cost of technologies such as solar PV means renewables have become cost-effective in many parts of the developing world, said Henning Wuester, director of the International Renewable Energy Agency’s Knowledge, Policy and Finance Centre. This is particularly the case in rural areas away from the electricity grid, where people are otherwise using relatively expensive, inefficient diesel generators and kerosene lamps. Despite this, the upfront cost of small-scale solar systems to power a few lights or charge a mobile phone can present a significant barrier to widespread adoption, said Aly-Khan Jamal, a partner at Dalberg Global Development Advisors. However, he said there have been “exciting breakthroughs” in addressing such challenges: Businesses providing these systems are using pay-as-you-go approaches that allow households and businesses to pay a small amount each month. Some allow you to eventually buy and fully own the system; others have a ‘perpetual lease’ where it is somewhat like paying for a utility. Mobile money payment systems make these pay-as-you-go models feasible, said Jamal, as they give businesses the ability to monitor and control electricity provision remotely, and make collecting payments very efficient – in turn significantly reducing costs.  Wuester added: Mobile payment schemes have been critical in driving the roll-out of off-grid solutions. This has enabled more than 300,000 households [across East Africa] to get access to electricity, including about 30% of the Kenyan population, 40,000 in Uganda and 20,000 in Tanzania. These numbers are growing rapidly. Maite Pina, renewable energy specialist at social investor Oikocredit International, gave the example of M-Pesa, a mobile money transfer system introduced in Kenya in 2007. Seven in 10 adults in Kenya now use the cash alternative, making 9m transactions daily. Pina said that Oikocredit – together with London-based solar systems provider BBoxx – uses M-Pesa to collect monthly payments from solar system users in sub-Saharan Africa. Jamal pointed out, however, that mobile money penetration isn’t even across all countries, so different approaches need to be used depending on the market. What’s more, he added: In the most remote and low income communities, mobile networks don’t invest in telecoms infrastructure (it’s not worth it for them) so relying on mobile money to reach these really challenging communities may not be sufficient. Social entrepreneur and investor Jamie Hartzell put the following question to the panel: The boom in pay-as-you-go household solar in East Africa is very exciting. But it is all based on credit, and the companies have a view to selling other products like TVs. How big is the risk that boom will turn to bust and push the poorest of the poor into unpayable debt? Nico Tyabji, director of strategic partnerships at solar financier SunFunder, replied that while users might have a legally enforceable contract, “the reality is no one’s going to come knocking” – they just don’t get the service any more.  Tyabji said that since cutting off access isn’t in the companies’ interest, they spend time thinking about how to make the process work best, for example by setting up payment models around harvest season so that users can pay when they have access to money rather than having to stick to a regular payment schedule. However, he added that as products and services get bigger and pricier, Hartzell’s concerns could become an issue. Edward Hanrahan, CEO of ClimateCare, reiterated the need for caution in what he described as the “massive rush to [...] provide credit at levels unseen before to the lowest income populace”.  He cited the example of Pamoja Life, one of ClimateCare’s investment projects in east Africa, which ensures that the overall monthly or weekly cost of the goods provided is lower than the goods it is displacing (for example, a solar unit costs less than equivalent kerosene). This means monthly outgoings are reduced rather than increased.  Hanrahan added: Of course, we are all now looking at providing ‘add-on’ products – fridges, internet access, TVs. It is crucial that we manage the ladder of credit in a very responsible manner “The world is not investing enough in renewables as a whole, not just off-grid solar, given the imperatives of climate change and sustainable development goals,” said Jeremy Leggett, founder of Solarcentury and SolarAid, and chairman of Carbon Tracker. While investment in large, centralised energy systems is driven mainly by multilateral agencies and large developers who rely on long term power purchase agreements, there is still a funding gap for decentralised systems where the requirements are smaller and the risks are higher, said Pina. Despite a growing interest in off-grid developments and new debt structures, Pina believes there is still a need to develop new guarantee structures to attract investors. Tyabji said organisations such as SunFunder came into being to plug part of that investment gap: With a few exceptions, we haven’t yet seen the levels of investment from development banks (let alone commercial banks) that other kinds of energy and infrastructure projects get. So it’s still down to niche players like us."
"The residents of a small coastal Alaskan village have voted to move to the mainland because of rising sea levels, but they may not have the funds to do it.  The 600-person village of Shishmaref, located on an island just north of the Bering Strait, has for decades been ravaged by erosion tied to climate change, leading residents to seek a more sustainable place to live.  But the community is racked by poverty, making it difficult to relocate, which is estimated to cost $180m.  Officials held a special election on Tuesday so residents could vote on whether to relocate or to stay and add environmental defenses. The vote was relatively close, with 89 for relocating and 78 to remain.  But both choices came with a steep price tag. The most recent estimate on relocating, from a 2004 Army Corps of Engineers study, was $180m. Officials said it would cost $110m for the environmental protections needed for the community to safely stay in one of Alaska’s most eroded coastal areas.  Mayor Harold Weyiouanna Sr told local news channel KTUU that doing nothing was not an option because while land crumbles into the sea, the community continues to grow.  “They did put a seawall or rock walls up, and it seems to be holding, but we need more protection to protect the whole island,” Weyiouanna said.  The US Government Accountability Office (GAO) said Shishmaref is one of 31 villages that face “imminent threats” from flooding and coastal erosion. Shishmaref residents have been considering relocation since the mid-1970s, when it first introduced shoreline defense structures. The community also voted to leave in 2002, but was unable to because of cost.  In February 2015, Sally Jewell, the secretary of the interior, announced $8m in funding for “projects that promote tribal climate change adaption” in Alaska. But that is far short of the money needed in Shishmaref and, likely, the most vulnerable communities impacted by climate change. In February, a community of about 60 people in Louisiana was named as the first official climate refugees in the US. The federal government granted $48m for the relocation of people in Isle de Jean Charles, Louisiana, which is disappearing into the Gulf of Mexico.  By 2050, 50 million to 200 million people are expected to be displaced by climate change, according to the United Nations University Institute for Environment and Human Security and the International Organization for Migration. Shishmaref residents say they have felt the pressure to move for decades.  “Within the next two decades, the whole island will erode away completely,” wrote Esau Sinnok, a Shishmaref native and Arctic Youth Ambassador, in an essay for the Department of the Interior in 2015. “To put this in perspective: I was born in 1997, and since then, Shishmaref has lost about 100 feet,” he continued. “In the past 15 years, we had to move 13 houses – including my dear grandma Edna’s house – from one end of the island to the other because of this loss of land.”"

"California’s attempt to curb emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, is facing vocal opposition from a dairy industry that fears government meddling in the flatulence of its cows. The California Air Resources Board (ARB) has set a goal of slashing methane emissions by 40% by 2030, from 2013 levels, and has targeted the belching and farting – known as “enteric fermentation” – of California’s 5.5 million beef and dairy cows, as well as the manure they create.  A strategy document produced by the regulator states that improved manure management practices, new diets for cattle and “gut microbial interventions” could help cut the amount of methane released into the atmosphere. State legislators are currently considering a bill to enforce these suggestions.  Methane, primarily emitted from agriculture and the fossil fuel industry, doesn’t linger in the atmosphere as long as carbon dioxide. But it is 25 times more potent as a greenhouse gas over a 100-year period.  California has moved to limit methane after the state’s glowing reputation for climate action received a nasty blow by a natural gas leak this year in the mountains above Los Angeles that took 112 days to plug and spewed 97,100 metric tonnes of methane into the atmosphere.  But the state’s dairy industry has criticized the crackdown on methane leaking from cattle, launching a social media and email campaign that claims the ARB is overstepping its remit and raises the specter of exploding cows.  “The focus here is to highlight ARB’s efforts at over-regulating the dairy industry,” said Anja Raudabaugh, chief executive of Western United Dairymen. “By nature’s design, (cows) pass lots of gas. Quite frankly, we want them to expel gas so they don’t explode.” The Milk Producers Council has also lambasted the prospect of new regulation, with the lobby group’s general manager Rob Vandenheuvel stating that the methane rules plan “threatens the future of the California dairy industry”. “This is about fighting against the ridiculously stupid ‘go-it-alone’ strategy for implementing business killing regulations aimed at reducing greenhouse gases,” Vandenheuvel said.  “When the US talks about going this direction, while countries like China refuse, I call that crazy. When a single state like California does it on its own, I call that absolutely insane.” In May, the Obama administration unveiled new rules to cut methane emissions from the oil and gas industry by up to 45% by 2025, from 2012 levels. The rules are part of a number of executive actions taken by the president this year – including on emissions from aircraft and refrigerants – in the face of escalating global temperatures.  The world has just experienced 14 consecutive months of record heat, with scientists expressing alarm at the pace of temperature increase and resulting impact upon glaciers and sea levels. Neither California nor the federal government, however, has yet adopted an idea from Argentina’s government that large backpacks be strapped onto cows to trap methane and turn it into green energy."
"A group of 130 institutions that control US$13tn of investments have called on G20 nations to ratify the Paris agreement this year and accelerate investment in clean energy and forced disclosure of climate-related financial risk. Countries that ratified the Paris agreement early would benefit from better policy certainty and would attract investment in low-carbon technology, the signatories said in a letter before the G20 heads of government meeting in September.  They called for strong carbon pricing to be implemented, as well as regulations that encouraged energy efficiency and renewable energy. Plans for how to phase out fossil fuels also needed to be developed, they said. Financial regulators needed to force companies to disclose how climate change, and climate-related policies, would impact their bottom line, the group said. “So investors are asking companies: tell us what the implementation of the Paris agreement means for your business so that we can price that risk and invest accordingly,” said Emma Herd, the chief executive of the Investor Group on Climate Change (IGCC) – one of the six organisations that represent the 130 investors on the letter. Herd said that required not only mandatory reporting but also for that reporting to be standardised so that investors can compare between companies and between industries. The signatories of the letter wrote: “The Paris agreement on climate change provides a clear signal to investors that the transition to the low-carbon, clean energy economy is inevitable and already under way. “Governments have a responsibility to work with the private sector to ensure that this transition happens fast enough to catalyse the significant investment required to achieve the Paris agreement’s goals.” The letter called on G20 countries to begin preparing to strengthen their emissions targets, as was required by Paris. It also called for them to double investment in clean energy by 2020, as the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, urged in January. The G20 leaders summit will take place in China on 4 to 5 September. Under China’s leadership, this year’s G20 has had a strong focus on climate-related issues, establishing a green finance study group. “The nations that form the G20 are highly influential in achieving the full coming into force of the Paris agreement,” Herd said. “So if the G20 nations did actually all ratify Paris, then it would go a long way, if not get it across the line, of full implementation.” The investor group called for Germany, which takes over the G20 leadership next year, to continue and strengthen the focus on climate change."

"I’m guessing that Malcolm Turnbull gets a fair few letters on any given day. You wonder how he has the time to read them all. How do you prioritise the ones worth your attention and the ones that you can toss in the round-shaped filing cabinet under your desk?  Perhaps there’s some formula involved in picking out the ones worthy of a public response – some sort of computer model that measures time and effort against the votes you might get, the donors and lobby groups you can afford to upset and the sort of reaction you can expect from the mainstream media.  Either that, or the letters all get dropped into a giant hessian sack ready for a morning lucky dip.  Honestly, I’ve no idea.  But a factor that appears not to be all that important are ones warning of an unfolding crisis that threatens people’s way of life, impacts countries across the globe, condemns future generations to several metres of sea level rise and generally makes the future not all that pleasant.  The number of letters coming into the prime minister’s office of late from climate change and marine scientists warning of these sorts of scenarios would be very hard to miss, especially when they’re signed by some of the best informed scientists from Australia and the rest of the world. The latest one to drop into Turnbull’s office/social media feed/sack/bin carries the signatures of more than 150 of Australia’s leading scientists who work at universities and government agencies across the country. The letter says “governments worldwide are presiding over a large-scale demise of the planetary ecosystems, which threatens to leave large parts of Earth uninhabitable” and asks for “meaningful reductions” in greenhouse gas emissions and cuts to coal exports.  The letter, coordinated by Australian National University Earth scientist Dr Andrew Glikson, lays out a few facts.  July 2016 was the hottest month the world has experienced on a temperature record going back 136 years. Levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are rising at a rate not known in at least 55m years. Daytime heat records in Australia are being broken three times as often as cold records. Ice sheets are melting at an increasing rate and sea level rise was is accelerating.  Once he had collaborated with colleagues to refine the text, it only took Glikson a couple of days to gather the signatures.  He told me there was an increasing sense of frustration among scientists that warnings and predictions, stemming from peer-reviewed research over many years, were going unheeded in the corridors of power.  He put the lack of genuine action to cut greenhouse gas emissions down to two things: a media that downplays or ignores the issue, and a fossil fuel industry with too much power over the political process. Many people just don’t understand the issue because there has been something of a cover-up across many parts of mainstream media, with a few exceptions. Sure, the media reports the issue, but they don’t explain it. But the fossil fuel industry is the largest in the world by far. There’s an enormous vested interest and the political elites just follow that money. So Glikson admitted he didn’t “anticipate a response” from the prime minister’s office.  The letter, like several others over the last year or so, have called for Australia to move away from its support for the fossil fuel industry, in particular coal. In October last year, just before the United Nations climate talks in Paris, scientists joined campaigners and advocates to sign an open letter to world leaders asking for a moratorium on new coalmines in Australia. Australia was in the process of doubling its coal exports, the letter said, something that was “incompatible with the world’s objective of limiting global warming below dangerous levels”.  In February this year, about 3,000 scientists from more than 60 countries sent a letter to the prime minister pleading for reconsideration of the drastic cuts to climate research planned at the CSIRO. The letter said that rather than cut climate change research, what was needed was more investment.  Without committing to the continued development of next generation climate monitoring and climate modelling, billions of public investment dollars for long-term infrastructure will be based on guesswork rather than on strategic and informed science-driven policy. The societal benefits of climate science far outweigh the likely high costs of reacting to future climate change instead of strategically planning for it. In June more than 2,000 marine scientists and reef managers from across the world sent Turnbull a letter asking his government to “stop endorsing the export of coal” and to “stop or revoke the approval of new mines”.  Letter to @TurnbullMalcolm from 2k+ coral scientists asks for end to backing of coal exports and no more coal mines pic.twitter.com/4Cx6p2obWj Coral reefs supported 500 million people worldwide, the letter said, but reefs were “threatened with complete collapse” A quarter of marine species were at risk, exposing “hundreds of millions of people to decreasing food security and increased poverty”.  So let’s say thanks to either the luck of the draw or advice from his policy team, Turnbull finds himself reading the latest open letter from scientists asking for leadership on cutting greenhouse gas emissions. What should he do?  Maybe he could take some words of advice from a former version of himself?  We know that the consequences of unchecked global warming would be catastrophic. We as a human species have a deep and abiding obligation to this planet and to the generations that will come after us … A zero emission future, we know, is absolutely essential if we are to leave a safe planet to our children and the generations that come after them."
"George Monbiot’s article (The climate crisis is already here – but no one’s telling us, 3 August) reinforced something I’ve been aware of since the Paris climate talks – a dearth of information and emphasis in the media regarding action worldwide aiming to ensure that the world’s average temperature doesn’t rise by more than 1.5C above the pre-industrial level. Why am I hearing about small community efforts to install solar panels in emails from organisations like Friends of the Earth and 10:10 and not on TV or in the papers? Why is it that the decision of the Saudi government to move to renewables was not trumpeted by the media, but had to be searched out online? Why is it that the efforts of organisations like Ethex are not being publicised and praised, giving more people the knowledge they need in order to invest in community renewable energy projects? Above all, why is it that the appalling and shameful lack of action of the Conservative government on reaching the Paris goals is not being more frequently and urgently challenged in the media?  There is far more that can be done by individuals, but people are not reminded of the urgency of their responsibilities, perhaps because the media feel that their audience will become saturated and resistant if too much emphasis is placed on these issues. Meanwhile, the world seems to be en route to a terrifying climatic future, and our grandchildren will surely be justified in saying: “Why didn’t you do something before it was too late?”Penny KentStroud, Gloucestershire • George Monbiot laments the failure of the press to keep alive awareness that global warming is already upon us. But he ignores the failures of another institution: the university. A proper basic task of academic inquiry is to help promote human welfare by intellectual and educational means. In a democracy, human welfare requires the electorate to have a good understanding of what our problems are and what we need to do about them – above all our urgent global problems such as climate change. Hence, universities, in seeking to promote human welfare, need to take up, as a basic task, intelligent public education about our problems and what to do about them. Promoting public awareness of the vital need to do much more to halt climate change, by means of discussion and debate, ought to be a basic activity of universities. At present it is not.Nicholas MaxwellEmeritus reader, science and technology studies, University College London • While George Monbiot is right to berate the media industry for granting the transport, farming, gas, oil and coal industries “a social licence to operate”, thus failing to “prevent climate breakdown”, despair is a poor motivator. So it’s good to know that, in 2015, 147 gigawatts of renewable electricity – the largest ever annual increase – came online and more than twice the amount was spent on renewables compared with coal- and gas-fired generation. About $6.22tn is being invested in the green economy, from central banks, development banks, business, city governments and capital markets. In addition Sweden, Costa Rica and Germany have committed to go carbon neutral; India has promised to make all cars electric; Norway has vowed to be the first country to be “deforestation free” and go carbon neutral by 2030 and China’s installed renewable energy capacity is bigger than all other countries around the world combined. But George is right that the climate crisis is already here. So, spurred on by him and because the lies are still landing thick and fast, we must all act individually and together by pressuring governments and businesses to accelerate de-carbonisation.David MurrayWallington, Surrey • George Monbiot is spot on. I awoke during the early morning a week ago and turned on the World Service broadcast on BBC Radio 4. There was a news item quoting the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration report on the latest (June 2016) monthly land and oceanic temperatures. The report said that the recent trend of rising temperatures was continuing and the latest figures showed that the Paris target was close to being breached. I was interested to see how this story would develop over the next few hours and days, particularly on the national news. The result was more or less complete silence. It took a couple of days before the BBC News website Science and Environment page (you have to scroll down to the bottom of the opening page to find it) had a brief reference to the issue. Why should this be so? As a topic of international importance for the future of the planet it surely warrants much greater exposure.Alan WilliamsPontypool, Gwent • George Monbiot paints a depressing picture on climate change but he may have understated some concerns. Even if emissions from human activities are cut, those from melting ice sheets will increase while the darker surfaces exposed will absorb more heat. It is the total levels of all greenhouse gasses that are relevant, and I suspect there is a lag between rising levels and associated temperature rises, so temperature rises now reflect rising levels some years back. The situation may be worse than he suggests. Still, there are various ways of cutting human emissions and, as an obvious retort to sceptics, most would still be sensible if climate change were purely natural or somehow a damp squib. Less waste, fewer futile activities, restoring fish stocks, reducing livestock’s impact, improving food security, alternatives to fossil fuels and combining conservation with careful use spring to mind, although bioengineering may still be necessary, despite its potential risks. I accept that nobody really wants the job or bill or to have their lifestyle affected but the potential financial harm alone from climate change is massive, so an insurance policy is worthwhile. The world may be run by bean-counters but surely some of them are numerate.Iain ClimieWhitchurch, Hampshire • If climate change is as important as George Monbiot asserts (and in the long term nothing else matters much if we get it wrong), should we not be considering it in our “Brexit strategy”? Thus far all we have heard is that trade is good for competition and should be maximised. Without a carbon tax – or rationing – this will also maximise carbon emissions and we are toast.James PageRichmond upon Thames, Surrey • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com"
"Donald Trump has refused to endorse Paul Ryan and John McCain, despite being endorsed for the presidency by both men. “I like Paul, but these are horrible times for our country. We need very, very strong leadership. And I’m just not quite there yet,” the Republican nominee said of the House speaker. Ryan’s campaign spokesman said: “Neither Speaker Ryan nor anyone on his team has ever asked for Donald Trump’s endorsement.” Earlier on Tuesday, Barack Obama called Trump “unfit” and “woefully unprepared” to be president and urged Republican leaders to denounce their nominee. The French president, François Hollande, also chipped in, saying the real estate magnate made people “want to retch”. Early on Wednesday morning, Trump denied reports of growing unhappiness within his campaign over erratic public conduct and missteps: “There is great unity in my campaign, perhaps greater than ever before,” he tweeted. On Tuesday, he also told a supporter to “get the baby out of here” after the infant in question began crying during a speech he was making. And in more than a dozen interviews at two Trump rallies this week, Trump supporters tell Ben Jacobs they either don’t know or don’t care about his recent comments criticizing the parents of a Muslim soldier killed in Iraq.  Donald Trump will not endorse Paul Ryan as Republican splits widen The world is careening towards an environment never experienced before by humans, with the temperature of the air and oceans breaking records, sea levels reaching historic highs and carbon dioxide surpassing a key milestone, according to an international “state of the climate” report, led by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. “The impacts of climate change are no longer subtle,” Michael Mann, a leading climatologist at Penn State, told the Guardian. “They are playing out before us, in real time. The 2015 numbers drive that home.” Environmental records shattered as climate change ‘plays out before us’ Continuing US research shows more men and women aged 20-24 having had no sexual partner than those at the same age group born in the 1960s, 70s and 80s. “You would expect, based on the popular notion, that with apps such as Tinder, [young people are] a group that is looking for hook-ups and not long-term relationships,” said the study coauthor Ryne Sherman at Florida Atlantic University. “What we are seeing is this group is less likely to hook up, so to speak, than previous generations.” Separate research in the UK showed large numbers of young people experience sexual problems such as pain or anxiety during sex, the inability to climax and finding intercourse difficult. Less sex please, we’re millennials – study In time for the opening of the Rio Olympics today, the World Health Organisation has issued an advisory to athletes to spend as little time as possible in the waters of Guanabara Bay, where the Olympic sailing events will take place. “The water quality is shit because the sewage flushes in untreated. We all know that,” said Alex Batista, a local skateboard instructor. “No local would swim in it because we know we would get a disease.” Meanwhile, the Guardian asks whether Rio’s police are really the most violent in the world. What’s in the water? Pollution fears taint Rio’s picturesque bay ahead of Olympics Romantic or merely arduous? Dozens of homeless now call the banks of Sacramento’s American River home. Nisenan Indians settled here 5,000 years ago. Itinerant miners built shacks during the 1840s gold rush, followed by families displaced during the great depression. Now it is the turn of hundreds of modern outcasts with pets, bicycles, tents and tarpaulin. They come for the seclusion and opportunity to live on their own terms, reports Rory Carroll. Life on the American river: Mark Twain romance, or false hope for the homeless? San Francisco has voted against a proposal known as the “tech tax”, which would have forced the area’s biggest technology firms to fund initiatives to provide affordable housing and tackle the city’s homeless problem. The measure would have raised an estimated $140m annually to fund affordable housing and shelters for homeless people. The proposal was rejected by the budget committee of the board of San Francisco’s supervisors. San Francisco rejects ‘tech tax’ plan to require firms to back housing programs Google’s parent company, Alphabet, has been given the green light by US regulators to test autonomous delivery systems. The drones will be tested in one of six designated Federal Aviation Authority areas within the US. The announcement comes alongside a pledge from the US National Science Foundation to spend $35m over the next five years on drone research and a month after the US government green-lit restricted commercial drone flights.  Alphabet will begin testing Project Wing delivery drones in the US Ikea has responded to Kanye West’s request to “allow Kanye to create” by proposing the Yeezy: a bed big enough for West and all his celebrity friends. The rapper had told the BBC he had an interest in turning his hand to “a minimalist apartment inside of a college dorm, with a TV built inside of the wall” and was drawn to Ikea because of his goal of making his products more accessible, describing his “mission in life” as to do “high-end and all this stuff, and bring it to the people”. Yeezy to assemble: Ikea designs giant bed for Kanye West An Australian company may have solved the problem of rapidly browning avocados with a machine that “switches off” the enzyme that causes discoloration. The Australian-designed Natavo Zero, designed for pre-sliced or mashed avocado used in products like guacamole, can process about 4,000 avocados an hour.  Turn that brown upside down: avocado ‘time-machine’ stops fruit browning It’s easy to forget how threatening society once found the comedy of emasculation when, in 1959, Billy Wilder’s cross-dressing classic Some Like It Hot was condemned by the National Legion of Decency as “morally objectionable” for promoting homosexuality, lesbianism and transvestitism. Now Hollywood is going all out, with Channing Tatum looking to score comedy points as a merman in a remake of the 1984 Tom Hanks comedy Splash. Remaking Splash: is gender-swapping Hollywood’s new secret weapon?"
"Climate change is going to halve the area suitable for coffee production and impact the livelihoods of more than 120 million of the world’s poorest people who rely on the coffee economy, according to a new report by the Climate Institute, commissioned by Fairtrade Australia & New Zealand. The report findings follow stark warnings by some of the world’s biggest coffee producers, including Starbucks and Lavazza, who have said climate change is posing a severe risk to the industry.  Climate change is already impacting coffee crops around the world, according to the report. In Tanzania, where 2.4 million people’s livelihoods rely on coffee, production has fallen by about 137kg per hectare for every 1C rise in the minimum temperature on farms. Overall there has been a 50% decline there since the 1960s. Extreme temperatures and unusual high-altitude rains have also sparked costly waves of pests and disease through coffee farms. In 2012, coffee leaf rust affected half of the coffee across Central America – some producers in Guatemala lost up to 85% of their crop. In 2012-13 the damage in Central America amounted to about US$500m and put 350,000 people out of work. How climate change will impact coffee growers in coming decades will vary by region. Scientists think Nicaragua could lose the majority of its coffee-growing areas by 2050, and in Tanzania, coffee yields were projected to reach “critically low levels” by 2060. By 2080, scientists think wild coffee, which is important for genetic diversity of farmed coffee, could be extinct. For consumers of coffee, all of this will impact flavour, aroma and price, the report said. Some large coffee producers have been warning the world about the impacts of climate change. In 2015, Mario Cerutti from Lavazza told a conference: “We have a cloud hovering over our head. It’s dramatically serious. Climate change can have a significant adverse effect in the short term. It’s no longer about the future; it’s the present.” And in 2011, Jim Hanna, director of environmental affairs at Starbucks told the Guardian that climate change is a “potentially significant risk to our supply chain”. “If we sit by and wait until the impacts of climate change are so severe that is impacting our supply chain then that puts us at a greater risk,” he said. Since most coffee growers are poor smallholders, their ability to adapt to climate change on their own is limited. To adapt, coffee farmers could move to higher ground or away from the equator. But since coffee plants take several years to become productive, that would often be impossible without assistance. Other strategies involve developing more resilient production systems and diversifying crops, which also require support. “There are things we coffee drinkers can do to assist,” said John Connor, the chief executive of the Climate Institute. Connor said consumers should only buy brands that “provide a fair return to farmers and their communities while helping to build their capacity to adapt to climate change”. Fairtrade, which commissioned the report, said its “Fairtrade Climate Neutral Coffee” did that. And in 2010, several big coffee companies set up the “initiative for coffee and climate” which seeks to help farmers respond to climate change."

"Despite recent heavy rains, Ethiopia is still reeling from the worst drought to hit the country for half a century, particularly in the livestock-dependent regions of Oromia and Somali. Yet studies (pdf) suggest the country could have billions of cubic metres of untapped groundwater. The story is the same across many parts of Africa, where farmers rely on erratic rains and depleted surface water while potentially vast groundwater reserves go ignored. Africa’s subterranean water amounts to an estimated 660,000 cubic kilometres (pdf), according to research from the British Geological Society – more than 100 times the continent’s annual renewable freshwater resources.  A new initiative co-led by the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) is aiming to mobilise support for greater use of Africa’s under-used aquifers. Developed in the wake of targets set at the UN Sustainable Development Summit and the Paris climate talks last year, the goals of the Groundwater Solutions Initiative for Policy and Practice (GRIPP) include leveraging $1bn (£770m) of investments in sub-Saharan Africa for sustainable groundwater irrigation and improving groundwater access in the region for 4m rural households. The idea is timely given widespread drought across southern and eastern Africa, yet it is not without controversy. Decades of overexploitation in north Africa (pdf), where groundwater is more abundant, have left many sedimentary aquifers dangerously depleted and in some cases degraded by saltwater intrusion. In Morocco, for example, the water table of the Saïss deep aquifer – one of north Africa’s largest aquifers – has fallen by an annual average of 3m over the past 20 years. If the right policies and incentives are in place, however, groundwater can be exploited sustainably, argues Jeremy Bird, director general of IWMI. Not only is groundwater more locally available and more reliable than rain in many parts of Africa, says Bird, it also serves as a better buffer to climate shocks: “It provides an opportunity for farmers to move one step up the ladder from very uncertain rain-fed irrigation, which is subject to the vagaries of climate, to supplementary irrigation, which offers them the ability to provide water when the crop really needs it.” Improving Africa’s irrigation infrastructure has long been a goal of national policymakers and development agencies. The World Bank, for instance, is currently trying to mobilise international funders to help double irrigation levels in six countries in the drought-prone Sahel region.  The Sahel Irrigation Initiative Programme, with input from IWMI, is now considering the use of simple, farmer-managed pump bores alongside its focus on more expensive canals, reservoirs and other centrally-managed surface water infrastructure projects. Vincent Casey, water, sanitation and hygiene senior adviser at WaterAid, however warns these simple pumps must be managed well: “Despite the advantages of convenience and affordability, the scale of pumping is very difficult to regulate which inevitably has economic consequences when groundwater is depleted.” Africa may have considerable untapped aquifers, but not all are able to be easily and affordably accessed, says Casey. “Rural electrification has been limited, discounting the possibility of politically motivated energy subsidies that could make high powered pumping affordable to small scale farmers”. Capacity for groundwater withdrawal is also hampered by a lack of reliable hydro-geological data (Ethiopia has mapped less than one quarter of its groundwater resources) and relevant expertise.  All these factors contribute to a patchy experience of groundwater projects to date. According to UPGro – a DFID-funded research programme examining groundwater in sub-Saharan Africa – nearly one third of such projects in sub-Saharan Africa fail within a few years of construction. The World Bank puts the estimated cost of groundwater project failures at more than $1.2bn (pdf) in lost investment over the last 20 years.  The main aim of GRIPP, which is focusing on projects not just in Africa but around the world, is to correct this trend through the promotion of research and knowledge-sharing around sustainable groundwater withdrawal practices and policies. A vital step in this respect centres on farmer buy-in, says Ugandan water planning expert Callist Tindimugaya, vice president of the International Association of Hydrologists, a GRIPP partner. Because groundwater is an “invisible commons”, he argues, farmers struggle to know what comprises sustainable usage. Government provision of cheap power for water pumps and other price incentives to promote agricultural productivity can lead to overuse as well, he adds. “Local initiatives to co-manage the resource are increasingly being explored as an important element in sustainable groundwater use as farmers realise their common interest in safeguarding the resource,” says Tindimugaya.  A case in point from another part of the world is in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, where farmer groups in over 700 communities agreed to collectively monitor groundwater levels, to plan their crop planting jointly and to adopt water-saving techniques. The project, which ran from 2003 to 2009, successfully reduced overexploitation (pdf) in the semi-arid state. Since the project ended, however, and without adequate governance systems in place, most of the farmer-led initiatives have ceased. Policymakers might find incentives the best initial defence against unsustainable abstraction, says Bird. He cites a pilot project in the Chinese province of Shanxi, where farmers access set volumes of water from the state-run pumping system with pre-paid smartcards. If they use less than their quota of pumping time, they can trade it with other farmers. “Our role is to identify the types of policies which might work in a particular situation, learn lessons from other areas and then assess the impacts of these policy decisions over time and see what the implications have been,” says Bird.

"On Christmas Eve 1968, the Apollo 8 astronaut William Anders took a photograph of the view outside the window as his spaceship orbited the moon. The now iconic Earthrise image shows our half-moon blue planet under a decoration of clouds rising from the blackness of space over the lunar surface. The picture encapsulated Earth’s precariousness in the cosmos and, for many, contained a message of humility and stewardship for our home.  We’ve had Earthrise and images like it from the Apollo missions for half a century now. But suppose some aliens had been viewing our planet for its entire 4.5bn-year history. What would they have seen? Over nearly all that immense time, changes would have been very gradual: continents drifted; the ice cover waxed and waned; successive species emerged, evolved and became extinct during a succession of geological eras. But visible change has accelerated rapidly in the past few thousand years – a tiny sliver of the Earth’s history. Now geologists have decided those changes have been so profound, so global and so permanent that our catalogue of the Earth’s history needs to change accordingly. Since the last ice age, around 11,000 years ago, human civilisation has flourished in the climatically benign Holocene. Now they believe that epoch has come to an end and we have entered a new human-influenced age, the Anthropocene. The changes that our aliens could observe from space are not hard to spot. In just the last few thousand years, the patterns of vegetation altered much faster than before. These human-induced changes signalled the start of agriculture.  And human activity manifested itself in other ways that will leave traces in the geological record. Constructs of concrete and metal sprawled across the continents; domesticated vertebrates numerically overwhelmed wild ones; the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere rose anomalously fast; traces appeared of plutonium and other “un-natural” substances. The imaginary aliens watching our world would have noticed something else unprecedented in geological history. Rockets launched from the planet’s surface escaped the biosphere completely. Some were propelled into orbits around the Earth; some journeyed to the moon and planets. What do these trends portend? Should we be optimistic or anxious? It’s surprising how little we can confidently predict – indeed, we can’t predict as far ahead as our forebears could. Our medieval ancestors thought the Earth was only a few thousand years old, and might only last another thousand. But they didn’t expect their children’s lives to be very different from theirs. They built cathedrals that wouldn’t be finished in their lifetime. Our time horizons, both past and future, now stretch billions of years, not just thousands. The sun will keep shining for about another 6bn years. But ironically we can’t forecast terrestrial trends with as much confidence as our ancestors could. Their lives and environment changed slowly from generation to generation. For us, technological change is so fast that scenarios quickly enter the realm of wild conjecture and science fiction. But some things we can predict, at least a few decades ahead. By mid-century, the world will be more crowded, and our collective footprint will be heavier. World population is now 7.2 billion and is forecast to rise to around 9 billion by 2050. Experts predict continuing urbanisation – and huge growth of megacities such as Lagos, São Paulo and Delhi. Population trends later this century depend largely on what happens in Africa, where some UN predictions foresee a further doubling between 2050 and 2100. Moreover, if humanity’s collective impact on nature pushes too hard against what Johan Rockstrom calls “planetary boundaries”, the resultant “ecological shock” could irreversibly degrade our biosphere. And if global warming reaches a tipping point that triggers melting of Greenland’s ice, coastlines a millennium hence would be drastically different. Extinction rates are rising. We’ve only identified about two million of the (estimated) 10 million living species: we’re destroying the book of life before we’ve read it. To quote the great ecologist EO Wilson, “mass extinction is the sin that future generations will least forgive us for”. The darkest prognosis for the next millennium is that bio, cyber or environmental catastrophes could foreclose humanity’s immense potential, leaving a depleted biosphere. Darwinian selection would resume, perhaps leading, in some far-future geological era, to the re-emergence of intelligent beings. If this happens, or if there are aliens out there who actually visit and study the Earth, then, digging through the geological record (and applying archaeological techniques as well) they would uncover traces of a distinctive transient epoch, and ponder the all-too-brief flourishing of a species that failed in its stewardship of “spaceship Earth”. But there is an optimistic option. Human societies could navigate these threats, achieve a sustainable future, and inaugurate eras of post-human evolution even more marvellous than what’s led to us. The dawn of the Anthropocene epoch would then mark a one-off transformation from a natural world to one where humans jumpstart the transition to electronic (and potentially immortal) entities, that transcend our limitations and eventually spread their influence far beyond the Earth. Even in a cosmic time-perspective, therefore, the 21st century is special. It marks our collective realisation that the Anthropocene has begun – and it’s a century when human actions will determine how long that epoch lasts."

"Populations of a rabbit-like animal known as the American pika are vanishing in many mountainous areas of the west as climate change alters its habitat, according to findings released by the US Geological Survey. The range for the mountain-dwelling herbivore is shrinking in southern Utah, north-eastern California and in the Great Basin that covers most of Nevada and parts of Utah, Oregon, Idaho and California, the federal agency concluded after studying the mammal from 2012-2015.  This study’s conclusion marks a more authoritative statement about the role of global warming on the animal compared to research released in 2003 that found climate change was at least partly contributing to the animal’s decline. “The longer we go along, the evidence continues to suggest that climate is the single strongest factor,” said Erik Beever, a research ecologist with the USGS and lead author. The pika’s habitat on mountain slopes, known as talus, are becoming hotter and drier in the summer and harsher in the winter with less snowpack to serve as an insulator, Beever said. The study bolsters the long-running efforts of wildlife advocacy groups to have the animal added to the endangered species list amid concerns about global warming. The US Fish and Wildlife Service rejected a request in 2010, saying not all populations were declining. A new request was made this April by a high school student in New York state. A preliminary decision on that request is due out in early September, but the agency’s staff eill not take into account the new study because they are bound to only take into account information submitted with the petition, said fish and wildlife service spokeswoman Serena Baker. Noah Greenwald, endangered species director at the Center for Biological Diversity in Arizona, said the new research confirms that climate change is putting the animal at real risk. He said it should help with future petitions to have the animal declared endangered – something he says is necessary to ensure future generations are treated to seeing the critters during mountain hikes. “It’s gotta be one of the cutest animals in North America. It’s like a cross between a bunny rabbit and prairie dog,” Greenwald said. “Part of what makes our world interesting is the diversity of animals and plants that you can see when you go to different species.” President Barack Obama mentioned the plight of the pika when he spoke at Yosemite National Park in June this year about the damage climate change is inflicting on the nation’s national parks. He said the pika was being forced further upslope at Yosemite to escape the heat. The study did not quantify how many total American pika still exist, but honed in on several areas where the small animal has historically roamed eating grass, weeds and wildflowers. The animal is thriving in a few places, such as the Columbia River Gorge in Oregon and Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming, but overall is suffering, Beever said. Pikas had disappeared from Zion National Park in Utah despite being seen as recently as 2011. In nearby Cedar Breaks National Monument, they were no longer in three-quarters of their historical habitat, Beever said. Pikas were only found in 11 of 29 sites where they once lived in north-eastern California. In the Great Basin, which stretches from Utah’s Wasatch mountains in the east to the Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountains in the west, the population is down about 44% compared to historical records. “It’s not that they’ve just moved, they are gone all together,” Beever said."
"The “carbon footprint” for the pollution caused by UK consumption has increased slightly, official figures show. The amount of greenhouse gases linked to goods and services consumed by UK households, including emissions from the foreign manufacture of imported products, rose by 3% between 2012 and 2013, the most recent data shows.  But the figures are almost a fifth (19%) below the peak seen in 2007, when UK consumers were responsible for nearly 1.3bn tonnes of greenhouse gases. The figures cover imported and domestically produced goods and services consumed in the UK as well as heating homes and fuelling household vehicles with fossil fuels. The carbon footprint statistics from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) reveal the UK’s wider role in the output of emissions which cause climate change, compared with other data which only account for domestically produced greenhouse gases. Emissions associated with goods and services made outside the UK and imported for use by businesses and consumers make up more than half (55%) of the total carbon footprint for consumption, they reveal. Some 582m tonnes of greenhouse gases were linked to imports in 2013, up 7% on the previous year but down 22% from the 2007 peak, the figures show. Emissions linked to imported products from China, where many of the products bought in the UK are now manufactured, also peaked in 2007, but in 2013 were still 112% higher than in 1997. Greenhouse gases associated with producing goods and services in the UK which were then used in the country were down more than a quarter (26%) in 2013 compared with 1997. Emissions from heating homes have fallen 8% since 1997 but have been largely static for the last decade, despite household energy efficiency schemes. Road transport emissions rose between 1997 and 2007 but have fallen back to similar levels seen 20 years ago, the figures show. A government spokesperson said: “The UK’s total carbon footprint has fallen 23% since 1990 and greenhouse gas emissions remain 19% lower than a peak in 2007. “Tackling climate change is a priority and it is essential in ensuring economic prosperity and security for our country. The fifth carbon budget will help us meet the UK’s legally binding target of an at least 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.”"
"Columbus, Ohio, is a mid-size city known primarily as the home of Ohio State University, not as a hub of cutting edge technology for public transportation. But that is exactly what this city of 790,000 people plans to be. By 2019, residents of Columbus could see autonomous shuttles cruising the Easton commercial district, motion-sensitive LED streetlights that also provide free Wi-Fi internet to the residential neighborhood of Linden, and 175 smart traffic signals that aim to ease traffic jams and speed first-responders’ paths through the city. Residents will also be able to use one app to plan and pay for trips that require multiple types of public transportation.  Columbus’s smart city evolution is taking shape thanks to $40m in federal funds the city recently won as part of the US Department of Transportation’s Smart City Challenge. The challenge drew applications from 78 cities. The competition pushed cities to consider transforming their entire transit system, instead of doing so in the piecemeal fashion that typically characterizes city planning. It also provided an opportunity for city officials to see the technology that is available or under development, and share obstacles they face with their fellow urban planners. Mark Dowd, a deputy assistant secretary at the US Department of Transportation, said that the competition gave city planners an opportunity to work with technology developers and figure out a blend of technologies that suit their specific needs. “Automated vehicles are often described as linear projects,” Dowd said. “[But] how does automation work with the sharing economy, [or] with low carbon alternatives?” The applications say a lot about the key trends and challenges for smart transportation. Here, we explore four leading technologies that could radically change our daily commute. The world is waiting eagerly for the arrival of autonomous cars – and with good reason. Self-driving vehicles, from standard four-passenger cars to shuttles to jitneys, could reinvent how people live and travel around cities. They could also prompt cities to reconsider whether they even need parking spots. San Francisco, one of the seven Smart City Challenge finalists, proposes running a fleet of autonomous vehicles to carry people between their homes and transit hubs. Across the bay, the Contra Costa Transit Authority in Contra Costa County, California, has begun testing what it calls Shared Driverless Vehicles, which are six-seat autonomous buses that chart their routes with GPS and mapping software and avoid collisions by using data from sensors embedded in the buses. But, while autonomous vehicles offer great public benefits, they could also create unintended consequences, warned Amanda Eaken, the director of the Natural Resources Defense Council’s transportation and climate program. People could end up preferring self-driving cars over buses and trains, leading to more cars clogging the city streets, she said. Research suggests autonomous vehicles – if city transit agencies implement them thoughtfully – could reduce the number of miles vehicles travel by as much as 90%, Eaken said. But the US Department of Energy warns it could also lead to a 200% increase in miles traveled as people take advantage of the convenience by traveling farther and more frequently. And those vehicles would need to travel somewhere to park after depositing their passengers. “You thought it couldn’t get worse than single-occupancy vehicles,” Eaken said. “But imagine zero-occupancy vehicles circling the streets.” High price and safety concerns are among the biggest roadblocks holding back the use of autonomous cars. Tyler Duvall, a partner at analyst firm McKinsey & Company, explained that while enclosed, low-density places such as mining operations are already using huge, fully autonomous vehicles, self-driving cars are unlikely to hit city streets en masse until government regulations are in place to answer thorny questions, like who is responsible for collisions – humans, or the cars? Reports of collisions involving autonomous cars by Google and the fatal crash of a Tesla car using its autopilot feature earlier this year are raising fresh concerns about whether ceding driving to computers is safe. Autonomous technology isn’t the only good option for improving public transportation. Smart can also be simple: cities can do significantly more to encourage non-car transportation, particularly through easy bike sharing, more connected transit hubs and even working with existing ride-hailing services such as Uber or Lyft. There is no technology more critical to smart cities than sensors. Autonomous vehicles won’t work without sensors, particularly ones that monitor and track a vehicle’s position relative to other vehicles on the road. Sensors also allow autonomous cars to spot humans and other hazards. Sensors embedded into roads, traffic signs and other places throughout a city can collect massive amounts of data and provide information that can be used to allow people to plan their trips. For example, a network of sensors can tell riders when their next bus is coming, or keep track of the number of shared bikes at any docking station. Sensors can also help manage traffic flow by adjusting the length and frequency of traffic signals, or dim streetlights when no one is around. Sensors can even pick up acoustic signals and triangulate the location of gunfire. Some cities already put sensors to good use, tracking public buses as they move between stops. In cities such as Las Vegas and Farmington Hills, Michigan, sensors built into streetlights allow them to brighten or dim and monitor air quality. Sensors are expensive, but their prices will fall when demand for them increases. Traffic signals with built-in sensors can reduce congestion by as much as 20%, according to McKinsey, but they also can cost as much as $100,000 per signal to implement. It cost Los Angeles more than $400m to install smart signals that synchronize its 4,500 traffic lights in 2013, a time and money intensive project to tackle gridlock. As with location services on smartphones, sensors come with privacy concerns. When Las Vegas planned to install smart LED lights downtown, privacy advocates voiced alarm over the lights’ potential to record audio and video despite assurances from city officials that those features weren’t included. Analyzing and storing the enormous amount of data – and making it accessible to the public – poses a significant challenge for transportation planners, said Bettina Tratz-Ryan, a research vice president at market research firm, Gartner. As the winner of the Smart City Challenge, Columbus will get to use 100 kiosks created by Sidewalk Labs, owned by Google’s parent company, Alphabet, to manage and supply data.  The kiosks offer information about traffic and public transit services via free internet access, and they come with charging ports for USB devices. Their presence makes data accessible to those without access to mobile phones or internet at home.  New York City has already rolled out a number of similar interactive kiosks in the city as part of its LinkNYC program, which replaces phone booths. However, the program has drawn criticism over the kind of data it collects from users. (The kiosks ask users to submit their email address before connecting them to the free WiFi.) Perhaps the most mundane but critically important aspect of smart transportation technologies has to do with trip payments. Convenient payment systems help people travel without delays, especially when they embark on multi-leg trips that require different payment methods. For example, you use your phone to hail a taxi or rent a car by the hour to get to a subway station, where you will have to dig out cash or credit card to pay for the train. San Francisco and Portland both plan to roll out transportation apps. Portland’s UBMobilePDX, for example, gives commuters a range of options, including public transit, parking lots, biking and walking routes, and services for sharing rides, cars and bikes. The app also shows the cost, speed, safety and environmental impact of each option. Some cities like Los Angeles and London already make use of mobile apps to make trip payments easy – at least for those with smartphones. Last year, the San Francisco Municipal Transit Agency created an app that allows riders to pay for bus fares using their mobile devices. The city wants to expand the app to include the ability to pay for trips on other regional public transit systems."
"Becoming a world authority on sea ice has taken Peter Wadhams to the polar zones more than 50 times, travelling on foot and by plane, ship, snowmobile and several nuclear-powered submarines of the Royal Navy. Nonscientists who read his astonishing and hair-raising A Farewell to Ice will agree that the interludes of autobiography it contains are engrossing, entertaining and, when one submarine suffers an onboard explosion and fire while under the ice, harrowing.  Any reader should find the science of sea-ice creation and the implications for us all of its loss – explored and explained here with clarity and style – beautiful, compelling and terrifying. Wadhams thanks Ernest Hemingway for his title. Climate change, a cause and an effect of ice loss, brings conflict that would have interested the great author. Persecuted by trolls and climate-change deniers, Wadhams made news last year when three of his peers met premature deaths. One fell down stairs. One died in wilderness, possibly struck by lightning. A third, out cycling, was crushed by a lorry. Claiming that he had been targeted by a lorry while cycling, Wadhams speculated that oil companies or governments had it in for him and his ilk because of the conclusions to which their work has led them. But his book is more extraordinary than any conspiracy. A Farewell to Ice proceeds methodically. Ice cores, tubes of compacted polar snow, record the last million years of atmospheric change, during which the Earth has oscillated between ice ages and warm periods. Now the pattern is breaking. “Our planet has changed colour. Today, from space, the top of the world in the northern summer looks blue instead of white. We have created an ocean where there was once an ice sheet. It is Man’s first major achievement in reshaping the face of his planet,” Wadhams writes. Polar ice is thinning and retreating with unprecedented speed. All our ingenuity cannot, at present, change that. Because ice only grows in winter but can melt year-round, its growth rate is limited, while melt rate is unlimited. Ice is extraordinary stuff. A “puckered honeycomb” of oxygen and hydrogen atoms, it is highly mutable in different states because the length of the hydrogen bonds in its molecules varies. Ice exists near absolute zero, the lowest temperature theoretically possible. Recent research suggests it may have entirely covered the Earth three times, making “snowball Earths”. Ice coats space dust, giving stars their twinkle. Life may have originated in that shining dust, according to the astronomer Fred Hoyle. Polar ice functions as Earth’s air- and water-conditioning system, and our thermostat. Wadhams outlines how CO2 emissions are smashing the system, spinning the thermostat to hot. Without the albedo effect of ice – by which it reflects solar radiation up to 10 times more effectively than open water – we have entered a positive feedback loop. Wadhams puts this plainly. “There is no period in Earth’s history where the rate of rise of atmospheric CO2 is as great as it is today.” The asteroid that finished the dinosaurs blasted 4.5 gigatonnes of carbon into the atmosphere, “yet the CO2 rate rise [in the aftermath] was still an order of magnitude lower than the current rate”. The ice he worries about most covers Arctic seabeds – permafrost from the last ice age. Losing this will release huge methane plumes. Methane is 23 times more effective in raising global temperature than is CO2. Wadhams and colleagues have modelled the consequences using different dates for methane release. A business-as-usual approach by humanity makes 2035 a plausible moment for the permafrost to melt and methane to escape. The worst floods, fires, droughts and storms we have seen will be as nothing to what Africa, Asia and the Americas experience in this scenario. Millions die. Low-lying areas are inundated. Survivors live in a patchy post-apocalypse. Europe’s current refugee crisis would be dwarfed. We still have time, A Farewell to Ice concludes, for drastic action, despite long procrastination. The fall of Margaret Thatcher was bad for the ice: she was a fan of Wadhams’s work, quoting him extensively in her efforts to set up a body to understand and mitigate the loss of sea ice. Subsequent prime ministers did little or worse than nothing, suppressing facts that lobbyists in business and industry (some of them former Thatcherite ministers like Lord Lawson and Peter Lilley) did not like. Last year’s Paris agreement, when global leaders resolved to prevent a temperature rise of 2C (with an aspiration of 1.5C), gives Wadhams hope. He believes there is now a common will across the world to confront and avert the nightmare. Solutions include wind, wave, solar, tidal and nuclear energy (not the perilous water-cooled reactor type David Cameron wanted for Hinkley Point, which have a terrible record, but the “pebble bed” type, apparently) and, above all, direct air capture (DAC), which has yet to be invented. You pump air through a system that removes the CO2 and “either liquefies it or turns it chemically into something useful”, Wadhams says. Salvation requires “a [DAC] research programme on the scale of the Manhattan Project” and voluntary change by all: home insulation, no more SUVs or budget flights.

"Last month was the hottest month in recorded history, beating the record set just 12 months before and continuing the long string of monthly records, according to the latest Nasa data. The past nine months have set temperature records for their respective months and the trend continued this month to make 10 in a row, according to Nasa. July broke the absolute record for hottest month since records began in 1880. Similar data from the US National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) said the past 14 months have broken the temperature record for each month, but it hasn’t released its figures for July yet. The new results were published on the Nasa database and tweeted by climatologist Gavin Schmidt, director of the Nasa Goddard Institute for Space Studies. July 2016 was absolutely the hottest month since the instrumental records began. pic.twitter.com/GQNsvARPDH Nasa’s results, which combine sea surface temperature and air temperature on land, showed July 2016 was 0.84C hotter than the 1951 to 1980 average for July, and 0.11C hotter than the previous record set in July 2015. As the string of hottest months continues, 2016 is “virtually certain” to be the hottest year on record, said David Karoly, a climate scientist from the University of Melbourne. July data are out, and what do you know, still 99% chance of a new annual record in 2016. pic.twitter.com/ndSsbYuedA That string was caused by a combination of global warming and El Niño, which spreads warm water across the Pacific, giving a boost to global temperatures. Karoly pointed out that Nasa’s baseline temperatures, which new measurements are compared against, already included about 0.5C of warming in global temperatures. That meant July was about 1.3C warmer than the pre-industrial average. Karoly said about 0.2C of that anomaly was likely due to the El Niño, leaving about 1.1C mostly due to human-induced climate change. The El Niño itself has dissipated, but the effects on global air temperatures lag for between three and six months, Karoly said. As the El Niño declines, the size of the monthly anomalies has been decreasing, with February 2016 showing the biggest anomaly since records began, being an extraordinary 1.32C hotter than the average February between 1951 and 1980. Eventually, the monthly temperature records will stop, Karoly said. “We are still seeing the tail end of the El Niño warming in global temperatures,” he said. “We’re not going to set any records later this year.”"
"Leading climate scientists have warned that the Earth is perilously close to breaking through a 1.5C upper limit for global warming, only eight months after the target was set. The decision to try to limit warming to 1.5C, measured in relation to pre-industrial temperatures, was the headline outcome of the Paris climate negotiations last December. The talks were hailed as a major success by scientists and campaigners, who claimed that, by setting the target, desertification, heatwaves, widespread flooding and other global warming impacts could be avoided. However, figures – based on Met Office data – prepared by meteorologist Ed Hawkins of Reading University show that average global temperatures were already more than 1C above pre-industrial levels for every month except one over the past year and peaked at +1.38C in February and March. Keeping within the 1.5C limit will be extremely difficult, say scientists, given these rises. These alarming figures will form the backdrop to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change talks in Geneva this month, when scientists will start to outline ways to implement the climate goals set in Paris. Dates for abandoning all coal-burning power stations and halting the use of combustion engines across the globe – possibly within 15 years – are likely to be set. Atmospheric heating has been partly triggered by a major El Niño event in the Pacific, with 2016 expected to be the hottest year on record. Temperatures above 50C have afflicted Iraq; India is experiencing one of the most intense monsoons on record; and drought-stricken California has been ravaged by wildfires. Stanford University’s Professor Chris Field, co-chair of the IPCC working group on adaptation to climate change, told the Observer: “From the perspective of my research I would say the 1.5C goal now looks impossible or at the very least, a very, very difficult task. We should be under no illusions about the task we face.” The Paris summit first agreed to limit global warming to 2C above pre-industrial levels and then decided to try to keep it below 1.5C. This latter limit was set because it offered the planet a better chance of staving off catastrophes such as the melting of polar ice, which would no longer be able to deflect solar radiation and allow even greater global warming. Similarly, coral reef destruction and extreme sea level rises might be avoided if the 1.5C limit is achieved. “If the world puts all its resources into finding ways to generate power without burning fossil fuels, and if there were international agreements that action must happen instantly, and if carbon emissions were brought down to zero before 2050, then a rise of no more than 1.5C might just be achieved,” said Dr Ben Sanderson of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. “That is a tall order, however.” The problem was made particularly severe because moving too quickly to cut emissions could be also be harmful, added Field. “If we shut down fossil fuel plants tomorrow – before we have established renewable alternatives – we can limit emissions and global warming, but people would suffer. There would be insufficient power for the planet. There is an upper limit to the rate at which we can move to a carbon-free future.” The Paris agreement is vague about the exact rate at which the world’s carbon emissions should be curtailed if we are to achieve its 1.5C target. It merely indicates they should reach zero by the second half of the 21st century, a goal that was accepted as being ambitious but possible – until global temperatures increased dramatically this year. “It means that by 2025 we will have to have closed down all coal-fired power stations across the planet,” said John Schellnhuber, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. “And by 2030 you will have to get rid of the combustion engine entirely. That decarbonisation will not guarantee a rise of no more than 1.5C but it will give us a chance. But even that is a tremendous task.” Many scientists now believe the most realistic strategy is to overshoot the 1.5C target by as little as possible and then, once carbon emissions have been brought to zero, carbon dioxide could be extracted from the atmosphere to start to cool the planet back down to the 1.5C target. In other words, humanity will have to move from merely curtailing emissions to actively extracting carbon dioxide from the air, a process known as negative emissions. “Some negative emission technology will inevitably have to be part of the picture if you are going to keep 1.5C as your limit,” said Professor Jim Skea, a member of the UK government’s committee on climate change. “There will always be some human activities that put carbon into the atmosphere and they will have to be compensated for by negative emission technology.” But what form that technology takes is unclear. Several techniques have been proposed. One includes spreading crushed silicate rocks, which absorb carbon dioxide, over vast tracts of land. Another involves seeding oceans with iron to increase their uptake of carbon dioxide. Most are considered unworkable at present – with the exception of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage. Under this scheme, vast plantations of trees and bushes would be created, their wood burned for energy while the carbon dioxide emitted was liquefied and stored underground. “It could do the trick,” said Cambridge University climate expert Professor Peter Wadhams. “The trouble is that you would need to cover so much land with plants for combustion you would not have enough space to grow food or provide homes for Earth’s wildlife. In the end, I think we just have to hope that some kind of extraction technology, as yet unimagined by scientists, is developed in the next couple of decades. If not, we are in real trouble.”"
"After a century of shooing away hunters, tending to trails and helping visitors enjoy the wonder of the natural world, the guardians of America’s most treasured places have been handed an almost unimaginable new job – slowing the all-out assault climate change is waging against national parks across the nation. As the National Parks Service (NPS) has charted the loss of glaciers, sea level rise and increase in wildfires spurred by rising temperatures in recent years, the scale of the threat to US heritage across the 412 national parks and monuments has become starkly apparent.  As the National Parks Service turns 100 this week, their efforts to chart and stem the threat to the country’s history faces a daunting task. America’s grand symbols and painstakingly preserved archaeological sites are at risk of being winnowed away by the crashing waves, wildfires and erosion triggered by warming temperatures.  The Statue of Liberty is at “high exposure” risk from increasingly punishing storms. A national monument dedicated to abolitionist Harriet Tubman, who will be enshrined on a new $20 note, could be eaten away by rising tides in Maryland. The land once walked by Pocahontas and Captain John Smith in Jamestown, the first English settlement in the US, is surrounded by waters rising at twice the global average and may be beyond rescue.  These threats are the latest in a pile of identified calamities to befall national parks and monuments due to climate change. Receding ice, extreme heat and acidifying oceans are morphing America’s landscapes and coasts at a faster pace than at any time in human history.  “Yosemite’s famous glacier, once a mile wide, is almost gone,” fretted Barack Obama during a visit to the vast park in June.  “Rising temperatures could mean no more glaciers in Glacier national park, no more Joshua trees in Joshua Tree national park.  “Rising seas can destroy vital ecosystems in the Everglades and at some point could even threaten icons like the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. That’s not the America I want to pass on to the next generation.” Change, however, is inevitable no matter how quickly greenhouse gas emissions are cut. An NPS study from 2014 found four in five of America’s national parks are now at the “extreme end” of temperature variables charted since 1901.  “We are starting to see things spiral away now,” said Gregor Schuurman, an ecologist at the NPS climate change response program. “We are going to look back at this time and actually think it was a calm period. And then people will start asking questions about what we were doing about the situation.” There is now a broad new push to work out exactly what heritage is at risk and how to best to react. If there is a front line, it’s probably found in Alaska. The state has 24 national parks, including Denali, the largest protected park in the US at 6m acres. It is also part of the Arctic, the fastest warming region on Earth.  Permafrost, which currently sits underneath 80% of Alaska, is beginning to melt, causing sinkholes and landslides. The north-west coast is being chewed away by almost 150ft a year in places due to sea level rise aided by wind erosion from more intense storms. Wildfires are increasing, with a lack of snow cover allowing the flames to lick areas that haven’t burned in almost 5,000 years. These trends imperil treasures such as those found in Cape Krusenstern national monument on the north-west coast. It has extensive evidence of human habitation stretching back 9,000 years. The NPS is scrambling to survey the area as inundations are wiping away this heritage, often before archaeologists can document it. Dael Devenport, an NPS archaeologist based in Anchorage, takes regular helicopter trips to survey the 70-mile coast of the park. There are groups of abandoned houses claimed by the sea and wind, containing items such as lamps, stone tools and ulus – a type of half moon-shaped knife used to skin seals and caribou. The Inupiat people who live in the region have retreated from this part of the coast. “A lot of these sites haven’t been surveyed properly, we are trying to figure out which are most vulnerable and mitigate against that,” Devenport said. “You can see houses that are washing away, if you walk along the coast you see the profile of houses. “Most people haven’t thought about how climate change affects archeological sites. A site is a snapshot in time, it’s not like we can pick it up and move it somewhere else. We are in danger of losing a great deal.” The problem is exacerbated by rampant looting of artifacts. A recent survey found almost all of a former settlement of the Thule culture, ancestors of today’s Inuit, had been disturbed and stripped of items such as harpoon tips and figurines carved from walrus ivory. As permafrost melts and walls are washed away, more treasures are revealed to opportunists.  “It’s a big problem,” Devenport acknowledged. “It’s probably done by people from local communities who know where the sites are. They can sell items onto dealers, who can get about $50,000 for a figurine from a buyer in Japan.  “When that artifact has been pulled out from the ground and not documented, we lose all of that information. You’ve lost the whole story behind that item and how it was used.” Further south, in the lower 48 states, a different heritage is at risk. Changing rainfall patterns are affecting a number of parks in the south-west. Extreme rain events caused two major wall collapses in historic structures at Tumacácori national historical park in southern Arizona. The structures, built by Spanish missionaries more than 300 years ago, are made from adobe, a type of sun-dried clay. The NPS already devotes 2,500 hours a year to maintain these buildings. However climate change is placing a further strain on this heritage. “For the more vulnerable sites, particularly adobe structures which seem to be the canaries in the coal mine in the south-western US, losses are already rapidly occurring,” said the NPS’ Lauren Meyer, who is heading new research into the issue.  Meyer said there is a “great urgency” to intervene and save cultural sites at risk from a rapidly warming planet. “The longer we wait to act, the more history we lose,” she said. Conservationists complain about a lack of funding to identify and preserve at-risk sites, but even if these locations could all be propped up and artifacts protected, the changes to the wider ecosystems march on. Temperature increases vary slightly according to park (the Grand Canyon has warmed on average by 2.4F since 1916, while the Everglades has heated up by 1.5F) – but the trend is inexorably upwards. This warming is influencing a complex web of processes in national parks. As John Muir, considered the father of US national parks, put it: “Tug on anything at all and you’ll find it connected to everything else in the universe.” Climate change is set to alter American forests as much as the arrival of white settlers did. The fire season is expanding dramatically. Some species are suffering, such as the native birds of Hawaii targeted by invasive mosquitos, which are able to survive in higher elevations as the forest habitat warms.  The remaining 65 groves of huge sequoia trees in California, among the largest living things on the planet, could be decimated by a warmer, drier climate. High-elevation species, such as red spruce and balsam fir, could be pushed off the mountains. The tree that gives Joshua Tree national park its name may not be able to adapt. Such changes cascade through the food chain. The grizzly bears of Yellowstone like to feast on the cone seeds of the white bark pine, a species under attack from the mountain pine beetle. If warmer winters fail to kill off the beetle, the bears will have to find another food source, impacting other species. A lack of snow for denning will affect bears and wolves; warming river waters will force out the salmon. “It’s hard to predict exactly what will happen but some systems have been pushed over the threshold, certainly,” said Schuurman.  “We need to recognize that climate change is ongoing and we can only expect the impacts will get stronger time goes on. I tell park managers that whether they are thinking about climate change every day or not, it is likely to find you and tap you on the shoulder. We should take heed of it.” A pressing question for the NPS is how these changes will go down with the public. Last year was a record, with 305 million visitors to national parks. But Sally Jewell, secretary of the interior, recently warned that a lack of funding to deal with the “existential” threat of climate change, along with unchecked development, will lead to ruin. Jewell said that current trends mean that the next century will mean “national parks and wildlife refuges will be like postage stamps of nature on a map. Isolated islands of conservation with run-down facilities that crowds of Americans visit like zoos to catch a glimpse of our nation’s remaining wildlife and undeveloped patches of land.” Some national parks are already looking at how to respond to this potentially diminished future. Parks in the south, for example, may offer nighttime activities such as star gazing or bat-spotting.  Visitation could actually jump by nearly 25% in 2060 as it warms, according to one forecast.The summer months may become too hot for visitors to parks in the southwest. Either way, it will be hard to hide that a trip to the Rocky Mountains in Montana to see Glacier national park won’t involve seeing any actual glaciers. “Yes, that will be a visible and dramatic change,” said Schuurman. “Without being blasé in any way, people are adaptable and Glacier national park without its glaciers will still be a stunningly beautiful place. That said, I think anyone would look back and be sad about the loss.” Temperature rise Temperatures across US national parks have risen by about 2.4F in the past century.  Disappearing snow and ice  The number of glaciers at Glacier national park has halved since 1968. All of the park’s glaciers are on course to completely disappear by the middle of the century. Sea level rise Approximately 40 protected sites are at risk from a 1m sea level rise, with an NPS analysis calling it “one of the most obvious and most challenging impacts” of global warming. The Everglades could become inundated with salt water, with the ecosystem overwhelmed by invasive species drawn to its changed environment. More powerful storms could endanger the Statue of Liberty, which closed for nine months after Hurricane Sandy in 2012.  Wildfire The wildfire season in the west is far lengthier than it was in the 1970s. The risk is compounded by shrinking snow abundance – in Yellowstone there is an average of 30 fewer days with snow on the ground compared to the 1960s."

"Britain faces a problem in coping with its complex energy demands. It needs to provide extra energy to meet rising demands for power in coming decades but at a reasonable cost – while also reducing carbon emissions by considerable levels in order to meet its climate change commitments. This is not an easy combination to achieve. However, Hinkley Point was considered by many experts to be a crucial aid in reaching these goals. With its massive 3.2bn watt capacity, Hinkley Point C would provide 7% of the nation’s electricity when completed. Night and day, it would help to generate the power that would keep the nation working while renewable energy sources, mainly wind plants, would provide the rest of the electricity needed by homes and offices. “You have to have some baseload source to provide power when it is utterly calm and renewables are not providing energy,” explains Bob Ward, of the Grantham Research Institute. “Gas and coal plants – which can also supply that baseload – will no longer be viable in future because of their carbon emissions, which cause global warming. You are then left with nuclear.”  This dilemma reveals a major drawback that affects renewable energy. Wind and solar plants are intermittent power suppliers. They often provide power when it is not needed but fail to supply it when it is required. And until a method of storing energy on an industrial scale is developed, this drawback will continue to bedevil its deployment across the country. Research into ways to store energy on a large scale is now being pursued across the globe but may take decades. Similarly, other game-changing energy projects are being worked on. One of the most important of these is fusion power. This aims to recreate the process that provides the Sun with its energy. Nuclei of hydrogen atoms are fused together at colossal temperatures inside huge reactors to create helium nuclei – and a great deal of excess energy, but little pollution or radioactive contamination. However, current devices – in particular the international Iter fusion reactor being built in France with British involvement – are currently years behind schedule and vastly over budget. Few experts believe fusion will get us out of our current energy problem. Alternatively, we could continue to use fossil fuel plants but take their carbon dioxide emissions, liquefy them and then pump into the ground, a procedure known as carbon capture and storage. Britain has huge, empty North Sea oil fields which many geologists and energy experts believe would be ideal for storing liquefied carbon dioxide. Several test projects were set up in recent years, with the government pledging to provide funding of up to £1bn until, in November last year, it abruptly cancelled the programme, halting work on all major British CCS projects. As Luke Warren, chief executive of the Carbon Capture and Storage Association, said at the time: “This is devastating. This technology is critical for the UK’s economic, industrial and climate policies.” These may prove to be prophetic words."
"Agriculture and the overexploitation of plants and animal species are significantly greater threats to biodiversity than climate change, new analysis shows. Joint research published in the journal Nature on Wednesday found nearly three-quarters of the world’s threatened species faced these threats, compared to just 19% affected by climate change. It comes a month before the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) hosts its annual summit in Hawaii to set future priorities for conservation.  The team from the University of Queensland, the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and the IUCN assessed 8,688 near-threatened or threatened species on the IUCN’s “red list” against 11 threats: overexploitation, agricultural activity, urban development, invasion and disease, pollution, ecosystem modification, climate change, human disturbance, transport and energy production.  It found that 6,241 (72%) of the studied species were affected by overexploitation – logging, hunting, fishing or gathering species from the wild at rates that cannot be compensated for by reproduction or regrowth.  These included the Sumatran rhinoceros, western gorilla and Chinese pangolin – all illegally hunted for their body parts and meat – and the Bornean wren babbler, one of 4,049 species threatened by unsustainable logging. Some 5,407 species (62%) were threatened by agriculture alone. The cheetah, African wild dog and hairy-nosed otter are among the animals most affected by crop and livestock farming, timber plantations and aquaculture.  At the same time, the analysis showed, anthropogenic climate change – including increases in storms, flooding, extreme temperatures or extreme drought and sea-level rise – is currently affecting just 19% of species listed as threatened or near-threatened, and was ranked seventh among the 11 threats.  Hooded seals are among the 1,688 species affected. These have declined by 90% in the north-eastern Atlantic Arctic over the past few decades as a result of extensive declines in regional sea ice, and the availability of sites for resting and raising pups. The common hippopotamus and leatherback turtle are also being affected by climate-related droughts and high temperatures. The analysis comes a month before representatives from government, industry and NGOs meet in Hawaii for the annual IUCN World Conservation Congress. High on the agenda will be defining a sustainable path for translating climate and development agreements – including the 2015 Paris agreement – into conservation actions. But the authors say it is crucial that efforts to address climate change do not overshadow more immediate priorities for the survival of the world’s flora and fauna. Delegates must focus on proposing and funding actions that deal with the biggest threats to biodiversity, they urge.  “Addressing these old foes of over-harvesting and agricultural activities are key to turning around the biodiversity extinction crisis,” said lead author, Sean Maxwell of the University of Queensland, Australia. “This must be at the forefront of the conservation agenda.” But the authors say there are solutions to alleviate the harm caused by overexploitation and agricultural activities, such as sustainable harvest regimes, hunting regulations and no-take marine protected areas, international forums such as Cites and public education to reduce demand.  Dr James Watson, co-author of the study from the WCS and the University of Queensland, said: “History has taught us that minimising impacts from over-harvesting and agriculture requires a variety of conservation actions but these can be achieved.  “Actions such as well-managed protected areas, enforcement of hunting regulations, and managing agricultural systems in ways that allow threatened species to persist within them, all have a major role to play in reducing the biodiversity crisis. These activities need to be well funded and prioritised in areas that will reduce threat.”"
"Ice scientists are mostly cheerful and pragmatic. Like many other researchers coolly observing the rapid warming of the world, they share a gallows humour and are cautious about entering the political fray. Not Peter Wadhams. The former director of the Scott Polar Research Institute and professor of ocean physics at Cambridge has spent his scientific life researching the ice world, or the cryosphere, and in just 30 years has seen unimaginable change.  When in 1970 he joined the first of what would be more than 50 polar expeditions, the Arctic sea ice covered around 8m sq km at its September minimum. Today, it hovers at around 3.4m, and is declining by 13% a decade. In 30 years Wadhams has seen the Arctic ice thin by 40%, the world change colour at its top and bottom and the ice disappear in front of his eyes. In a new book, published just as July 2016 is confirmed by Nasa as the hottest month ever recorded, this most experienced and rational scientist states what so many other researchers privately fear but cannot publicly say – that the Arctic is approaching a death spiral which may see the entire remaining summer ice cover collapse in the near future.  The warming now being widely experienced worldwide is concentrated in the polar regions and Wadhams says we will shortly have ice-free Arctic Septembers, expanding to four or five months with no ice at all. The inevitable result, he predicts, will be the release of huge plumes of the powerful greenhouse gas methane, accelerating warming even further.  He and other polar experts have moved from being field researchers to being climate change pioneers in the vanguard of the most rapid and drastic change that has taken place on the planet in many thousands of years. This is not just an interesting change happening in a remote part of the world, he says, but a catastrophe for mankind.  “We are taking away the beautiful world of Arctic Ocean sea ice which once protected us from the impacts of climate extremes. We have created an ocean where there was once an ice sheet. It is man’s first major achievement in re-shaping the face of the planet,” he writes. And, boy, are we seeing extremes. So far this year, the planet’s average temperature has been 1.3C warmer than the late 19th century, and 2016 is virtually certain be the hottest year ever recorded. Britain and northern Europe may have had average temperatures, but 500 million people in the Middle East and north Africa, along with most of south-east Asia, have experienced droughts and searingly hot days and nights, which are only partly to do with the natural El Niño phenomenon. Meanwhile, China, India and the US have seen some of their longest heatwaves and worst floods in decades, and nearly 100 million people will need food aid in the coming months because of disrupted rainfall patterns. Mitribah in Kuwait has reported a world record 54C, India and Iran have both recorded their highest ever temperatures, and deadly heatwaves have struck China, the US, Indonesia and New Zealand. We are perilously close to the 1.5C limit of warming that all countries signed up to in Paris last year and on track for a 3C-4C increase which would make much of the world uninhabitable. Because Wadhams says what other scientists will not, he has been widely slandered, attacked and vilified by denialists and politicians who have advised caution or non-action. But now he returns their fire, exhorting people to counter what he calls “the sewage flow of lies and deceit” emitted by the deniers. Above all, he says, people who study climate change should speak up and be prepared to risk the blighting of their careers and absence of honours.  But he joins other climate researchers to cross lines that the public may still find unacceptable. He wants global action to find new ways to remove carbon from the atmosphere, and is not afraid of nuclear power – both of which answers can be swallowed – but he also argues for a colossal, global research programme in geo- engineering.  This is the deliberate attempt to reduce warming by the planetary-scale manipulation of weather patterns, oceans, currents, soils and atmosphere to decrease the amount of greenhouses gases.  Spraying sun-reflecting chemicals into the atmosphere, mimicking volcanoes, blocking sunlight and fertilising the oceans with iron filings attracts people who think that technology has all the answers, but it should strike fear into most of the world, which has not been responsible for warming and which has no reason to trust politicians’ or scientists’ further meddling with planetary forces.  How to proceed safely in a warming world without disastrous unintended consequences? The need for truly urgent action is undeniable, but by the time answers have been found to the massive questions of science, engineering and governance that Wadhams agrees need to be solved before geo-engineering on a planetary scale can go ahead, it will be far too late.  Climate change has been caused by ignorance and stupidity and cannot be solved by endorsing more of the same with geo-engineering. The only answer is reducing greenhouse emissions. Fast. "
"Richard Di Natale has written to Bill Shorten, urging him to reject the Coalition’s attempt to slash $1.3bn in funding from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, effectively abolishing it. The Coalition plans to introduce its “omnibus” savings bill to parliament on Wednesday, with 24 savings measures worth $6.1bn.  It has been pressuring Labor to support the bill in full, saying all of its savings measures were included in Labor’s own pre-election costings so it would be hypocritical of the opposition not to support them.  But Labor on Tuesday accused the government of sneaking savings measures into the bill that were not part of its costings in the lead-up to the election. Labor’s environment spokesman, Tony Burke, also complained that some of the measures in the bill – such as the government’s plan to cut $1.3bn in funding to the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Arena) – were not the same measures that Labor had supported before the election. Now the Greens leader, Di Natale, has sought to capitalise on division within the Labor party about the Coalition’s omnibus bill, urging the opposition to reject the government’s Arena funding cuts completely. In a letter to Shorten, seen by Guardian Australia, Di Natale asks the Labor leader to publicly commit to maintaining Arena’s full $1.5bn in funding until 2022. “As you will be aware, in the 43rd parliament, the Australian Greens and the Australian Labor party worked constructively together to establish the Australian Renewable Energy Agency,” the letter says. “Many of the projects enabled by Arena are first of their kind in the world, with many more as first of their kind in Australia. These breakthroughs are now being exported to the world. “Without grant funding, these exciting projects will cease to occur in Australia, our researchers will move overseas and our ability to reduce carbon pollution will be irreparably curtailed.  “The perception that Australia is not a safe place for clean energy investors will only be reinforced if Arena is stripped of its grant funding. “I urge you to vote against schedule 5 of the Budget Savings (Omnibus Bill) 2016 or any other bill that cuts funding to Arena and publicly commit to maintaining the full $1.5bn currently allocated until 2022.” Labor threatened earlier this year to let the Turnbull government’s Arena funding cuts through parliament, in exasperation at what it saw as the renewable energy industry’s failure to properly criticise the Coalition’s plan for the agency.  The Coalition announced in March that it would allow Arena to continue managing its existing portfolio of projects, but it would cut $1.3bn in unallocated but legislated funding for the agency, and stop the agency from providing grants for emerging renewable energy projects."

"The documentary broadcaster Ira Glass, the man behind the hit radio programme This American Life, is in Britain this week with his theatre show, Three Acts, Two Dancers, One Radio Host. The production, a collaboration with the experimental dancers of Monica Bill Barnes & Company, puts storytelling and dance together in an improbable but, the reviews say, endearing and entertaining combination. The dancers like to bring dance into places were no one expects it. Mr Glass does the same with documentary. The collaborators are united in wanting to tell serious stories in an engaging manner. Not many subjects defeat Mr Glass’s creativity. But climate change, he admits, is beyond even his midas touch with a tale. “Any minute I’m not talking about climate change it’s like I’m turning my back on the most important thing that’s happening to us,” he said recently. The trouble with it is that it is “neither amusing nor surprising”. It is “resistant to journalism”.  He might have added that the news about climate change is rarely good, either. As most of the UK enjoys a brief August heatwave, Nasa has confirmed that July was the hottest month the world has experienced since records began. Even in Britain, where most of the month was wet and cool and felt not very summery at all, it was by a narrow margin the warmest month in the past 130 years of record-keeping – and it was the 10th month in a row that a new high was set. Siberian permafrost is melting, releasing lethal anthrax bacteria from thawing reindeer carcasses into the environment. There are floods in southern Louisiana which have killed 11 people and in California thousands are fleeing from forest fires. The link between short-term weather events and long-term changes in the climate may be tenuous, but it’s just what the scientists warned about. Ever since the general election 15 months ago, too, the political climate has seemed as bleak as the weather has been warm; subsidies for renewables have been cut and incentives intended to encourage landowners to give permission for fracking expanded. Theresa May’s restructuring of Whitehall closed down the Department of Energy and Climate Change. Yet there are glimmers of optimism, too. Decc’s critics argued that it was too small and too narrowly focused to be effective in the kind of territorial battles it needed to win in government. With the right political leadership, the new Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy could be capable of the kind of policies that people mean when they talk about joined-up government (although the Treasury will have views about that). The Paris climate summit commitment to cut carbon emissions far enough and fast enough to hold the rise in global temperatures below a maximum of 2C is helping to expand the market in renewables, not least by collapsing the appetite for investment in fossil fuels. Europe has doubled its power generation from green sources; in the UK it has almost quadrupled. Last year, it accounted for more than a quarter of power. But George Osborne’s attack on “green crap”, along with the eurozone crisis, hit investment hard. China and the US are the big new forces in green energy production. So this is the challenge: we need nuclear to keep the lights on. But not from Hinkley C. Instead, redirect the £30bn of subsidies into making the UK a good place for green investment again."

"Today is World Elephant Day, when people with a passion for pachyderms come together to celebrate the wonder of elephants and raise funds to protect them. It seems paradoxical that the largest land animal, which has come to symbolise strength and sagacity, should be so vulnerable – but across Africa and Asia numbers are dwindling as human activities and expanding agriculture squeeze elephants into smaller and smaller patches of fragmented habitat.  Even where habitat remains, the elephants themselves – despite legal protection – are hunted by criminal gangs for their front teeth, for their meat and for their babies (to be beaten into submission for a life of servitude in entertainment, temple ceremonies or tourist attractions). And on top of all this, elephants – like every other species – are suffering as climate change raises average temperatures, disrupts rainfall patterns and brings more drought and extreme weather events. Why should we care? A glance through the literature of organisations dedicated to saving elephants gives a clear idea of why people care about elephants. We find their size impressive; their improbable shape and sometimes comical behaviour endear them to children; their matriarchal society and cognitive capacity fascinate us; their ability to suffer and show compassion strikes an empathic chord in us; and they are high on the list of “must-see” animals on wildlife-watching holidays in Africa and Asia, so they bring in tourist revenues. All these reasons are perfectly valid, if largely anthropocentric, but they do rather miss the point of what elephants are for, ecologically speaking. The role they evolved to play in the forest-savannah mosaic that covered Africa and Asia is not just of academic interest. Fly across parts of Africa and Asia, and rainforests stretch to the horizon like a carpet of broccoli. The bumps on this broccoli are the emergent trees, rising above the surrounding canopy on massive trunks, the base of which would require several people hand-in-hand with arms outstretched to encircle. How did these centuries-old rainforest giants get there? Five or six hundred years ago, maybe a thousand in some cases, an ecological event took place: a monkey, bird or elephant ate some fruit, chewed and swallowed the seeds, then deposited them far from the parent plant in their droppings – in effect, nutrient-rich packets of fertiliser – which dung beetles then buried. In tropical forests, between 75% and 95% of tree species have seeds dispersed by animals, rather than by wind or water. Until recently, tropical forest trees were valued economically by the outside world only for their beautiful hardwood timber. Enshrined in the Paris climate agreement, however, is a new economic value – the sequestration and storage of gigatonnes of carbon. The inclusion of forest carbon in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) climate negotiations has been slow and complicated because of the tricky question of permanence. A forest can be here today and felled or burned tomorrow, so how can we guarantee the same storage of carbon per unit area long into the future? The answer is think of forests not as “sticks of carbon” but as forest ecosystems, comprised of thousands of interdependent species of plants, animals, fungi and micro-organisms. And carbon sequestration and storage is only one of several ecosystem services these forests and woodlands provide. Elephants, because of their size, appetite and migratory habits, disperse more seeds of more species further than any other animal. Tree species with small seeds such as figs can have them dispersed by birds, fruit bats, antelope, etc. Species with large seeds, such as mangoes and durian, need big animals such as apes and elephants to disperse them, sowing the seeds of the trees of tomorrow. Their dung is important, too, as fertiliser. An adult elephant produces about one tonne of first-class organic manure every week. Germination and seedling survival are much higher for seeds given such a good start in life. This is why ecologists refer to elephants as mega-gardeners of the forest – though elephants play this role in savannah-woodlands too, spreading acacia seeds far and wide (and in so doing, protecting the seeds from weevils that concentrate around the parent tree). The current wave of ivory poaching is killing some 30,000 African elephants a year. This is a tragic loss to the surviving members of each elephant’s family, and to the potential revenues from tourism, but think of the ecological impact. Think of the loss of soil fertility of 30,000 fewer tonnes of manure a week and millions of seeds not dispersed. Consider this in a broader timescale: before the advent of modern firearms, it is thought there were some 10m elephants across Africa. Even the most optimistic estimates today put the figure at under half a million. We have already lost 95% of the workforce of the forest and savannah. This is why the vast majority of the countries with natural elephant populations are calling for an end to the ivory trade everywhere. As long as ivory is coveted and sold anywhere, elephants are not safe. You cannot protect an animal with a fortune on its face, especially in a continent awash with guns and poverty. There is one more twist to the carbon story relevant to elephants. Botanists have reported a correlation between seed size and wood density. Tree species with big seeds, it turns out, store more carbon per unit volume of wood than tree species with small seeds. Thus, to maintain the high rates of carbon storage in Africa’s and Asia’s tropical forests, elephants are essential – not just in small, fenced protected areas but across what is left of their former range. The fact is that to stabilise the climate, we need elephants (and other “gardeners of the forest”) to keep doing what they do as much as they need us to leave them alone."
"What happens as large-scale migration becomes inevitable due to a combination of environmental, economic and humanitarian reasons? Do we tackle the drivers and help the displaced, or worsen conditions causing the displacement and reject responsibility for those affected?   The campaign for Britain to leave the EU was related to those sceptical of action on global warming and in favour of financial deregulation. It’s a paradoxical package, on the one hand creating the conditions for human displacement and migration through environmental damage and inequality, and on the other washing its hands of the inevitable consequences. Global inequality is recognised as one push factor in human displacement. Climate change is another major factor, and it’s set to worsen according to the UN refugee agency.  The Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, whose figures exclude drought and “slow burn” environmental degradation, say the largest increase in push factors were weather, especially floods, and other climate-related impacts. The Brexit campaign pivoted around the issue of migration. Key protagonists such as Ukip, who promoted and played on fears of migration, including the infamous poster, are also antagonistic toward renewable energy and action on climate change. Andrea Leadsom, the new environment secretary, who received support from key Ukip figures, asked her officials in 2015 if climate change was real when she became energy minister. The politics of Brexit are set to dominate Britain for years to come, holding hostage a broad range of public and environmental policy. One of the greatest threats to effective climate action will simply be the huge distraction for Whitehall of negotiating Brexit and renegotiating countless other treaties. The tragedy is that the whole project is built on a wildly distorted projection of Britain’s relative role in dealing with the global displacement of people. While the number of displaced people is shockingly high and rising globally, the latest figures from the UN clearly show it’s not countries like Britain that are mainly dealing with the problem. More than eight out of 10 refugees were given shelter by poor and middle-income countries close to conflicts, not by the world’s wealthy countries.  Yet David Cameron, was just one politician to use inflammatory, dehumanising language, describing migrants coming to Britain as a “swarm”. The new prime minister, Theresa May, did little better, running the Home Office with a policy to create a “hostile environment” for people in the UK without legal permission with mobile posters telling them to “go home or get arrested”.  Tightening border controls for people in a world of freely moving finance and one-sided trade, and in the grip of climatic upheaval, can only entrench and worsen poverty. It takes away one key, remaining option for people to improve their circumstances: to migrate.  Conversely, an environmentally viable, more equal global economy needs better management of international finance and trade. How can these things be balanced? Wanting to manage your borders is entirely legitimate, if done fairly and coherently. But that means exemplary climate policy and other innovations – such as taxing destabilising, cross-border financial speculation – as one attractive way of paying to ease tensions around migration.  But Britain finds itself in the grip of self-defeating politics, with a new carbon budget but no policy package to deliver it, accused by Ban Ki-moon’s UN climate envoy of betraying the Paris deal. The National Grid says we are set to miss our renewables and emissions reduction targets. Having voted to leave Europe, it now looks as if we are voting to leave a stable climate.  Some are understandably keen, perhaps desperate, to discern a silver lining from the current cloud, assuming some grander scheme in the manoeuvres of the new administration. But, in politics, signals matter. And, few seem stronger than housing the new government department for exiting Europe in the offices of the abolished Department of Energy and Climate Change."
"More than 60% of coral in reefs in the Maldives has been hit by “bleaching” as the world is gripped by record temperatures in 2016, a scientific survey suggests.  Bleaching happens when algae that lives in the coral is expelled due to stress caused by extreme and sustained changes in temperatures, turning the coral white and putting it at risk of dying if conditions do not return to normal.   Unusually warm ocean temperatures due to climate change and a strong “El Nino” phenomenon that pushes up temperatures further have led to coral reefs worldwide being affected in a global bleaching event over the past two years.  Preliminary results of a survey in May this year found all the reefs looked at in the Maldives, in the Indian Ocean, were affected by high sea surface temperatures. Around 60% of all assessed coral colonies, and up to 90% in some areas, were bleached.  The study was conducted by the Maldives Marine Research Centre and the Environmental Protection Agency, in partnership with the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).  It took place on Alifu Alifu Atholhu - North Ari Atoll - chosen as a representative atoll of the Maldives.  Dr Ameer Abdulla, research team leader and senior adviser to the IUCN on marine biodiversity and conservation science, said: “Bleaching events are becoming more frequent and more severe due to global climate change.  “Our survey was undertaken at the height of the 2016 event and preliminary findings of the extent of the bleaching are alarming, with initial coral mortality already observed.  “We are expecting this mortality to increase if bleached corals are unable to recover.”  The Maldives contains around 3% of the world’s coral reefs and the islands are considered particularly at risk of climate change because they are low-lying and threatened by sea level rises.  In Australia, more than a fifth of the Great Barrier Reef is estimated to have died as a result of the worst mass bleaching event in history. In Kiribati in the Pacific, as much as 80% of the coral is dead."

"A weightlifter who lost his family’s house in a cyclone danced off stage at the Rio Olympics on Tuesday to raise awareness of the threat climate change poses to his remote Pacific nation.  David Katoatau got more cheers than any other lifter, including a Brazilian, throughout the men’s 105kg B Group.  Katoatau’s dances became a trademark of his victory in the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, Scotland two years ago. That was the first gold medal in any global sporting event for his island nation of Kiribati.  He was also a social media sensation for his dancing as Kiribati’s flag bearer at the Rio Games’ opening ceremony.  Kiribati, located in the central Pacific, is suffering “extreme coastal erosion not just of the beaches but also of the land” according to its government.  Some scientists have predicted a catastrophic effect on Kiribati’s 21 inhabited islands. “Most people don’t know where Kiribati is,” Katoatau told Reuters. “I want people to know more about us so I use weightlifting, and my dancing, to show the world.  “I wrote an open letter to the world last year to tell people about all the homes lost to rising sea levels. I don’t know how many years it will be before it sinks.”  That letter was distributed at a Commonwealth Games Federation meeting by Katoatau’s coach, Paul Coffa.  “We don’t have the resources to save ourselves,” Katoatau said. Kiribati also lacks the resources for basic sports facilities.  “There was no gym when I started training as a boy, and there is no gym now,” said Katoatau, 32.  “I trained on the beach in the open sun. The bar would become too hot to touch so I had to train at six in the morning.” Katoatau moved to the Oceania Weightlifting Institute when he was 16 and has been coached by Coffa since then. He now lives and trains at the Institute in Noumea, New Caledonia in the South Pacific.  He has a coaching certificate and intends to team up with Coffa when his lifting days are over. His next target, though, is defending his Commonwealth title in Gold Coast, Australia, in 2018.  He won a state reward of A$11,000 ($8,400) for his Commonwealth gold and used it to build a home for his parents on Tarawa atoll, the most populated of Kiribati’s more than 30 atolls and islands. The house was destroyed in a cyclone soon after its construction, he said.  “We have built another one, but it’s close to the sea so there is always a worry.”  Katoatau, who finished 15th in his 2008 Olympic debut, came in sixth in the B Group with 349kg, 1kg more than his Commonwealth Games effort.  He made his first five lifts but failed with the last one. He kissed the bar and danced off stage regardless, to the cheers of the crowd. “I’ll be dancing again tonight,” he said."
"The United Nations has tried to cover up its involvement in the Australian government’s successful attempt to have all mentions of the country removed from a report on climate change and world heritage sites, freedom of information documents show. In May, Unesco published a report with the UN’s environment program, Unep, and the Union of Concerned Scientists about the impact of climate change on world heritage sites, which were also major tourist attractions. Australia was the only continent not mentioned, despite being home to several important sites, including the Great Barrier Reef, which were being heavily affected by climate change. A Guardian investigation revealed in May that three Australian sites were included in an earlier version of the report, but were removed after the environment department objected. As well, all mentions of Australia were removed from the introduction and other sections. The Guardian later published the draft section on the Great Barrier Reef that had been removed. The department said it had asked for the changes because it was concerned the information could negatively affect tourism.  Now emails between various government agencies and Unesco have been released to the website Climate Home under freedom of information but almost all the content has been redacted. A department official, Deb Callister, told Climate Home Unesco had asked for the heavy redactions.  “Unesco advised that it is their practice not to disclose exchanges of letters or correspondence between the secretariat and its member states, and requested that this type of material not be disclosed pursuant to this FOI request,” she said.  Approached by the Guardian, the department declined to comment, other than to say that the documents were released in accordance with FOI laws. Will Steffen, from Australia’s Climate Council, was one of the peer reviewers of the removed section on the reef and was not surprised the emails were censored.  “Obviously it would not look good for either party to be involved in covering up a piece of science, which on the surface of it was just reporting what was going on from a scientific perspective,” he said. “One would assume they would report on the science – you can do what you want with the science once it’s reported.  “But what gets us really concerned is when we see the science itself suppressed. That starts ringing alarm bells in scientist’s minds. That’s something that shouldn’t be happening in a western democracy.”"
"Across Australia, climate science denialists are beside themselves with glee at the voting into office of one of their own. Late last week, the Australian Electoral Commission confirmed that Pauline Hanson’s One Nation party had snagged Queensland’s final 12th Senate spot. Her candidate, Malcolm Roberts, is now a senator.   Roberts’ election is yet another demonstration of the quirkiness of Australia’s electoral system.  Only 77 people actually voted for Roberts as a first preference but, thanks to the popularity of Hanson, he’s in for three years.  Roberts’ own brand of climate denial – a heady mix of conspiracy theories and blind spots the size of the Antarctic ice sheet – is now in the national spotlight. Roberts has had wall-to-wall coverage across Australia’s media – from Sky News, to Lateline, to Insiders to flagship ABC radio. Even Triple J has joined in. News Corp’s Andrew Bolt, a strong promoter of the kind of material produced by Roberts, told the senator there were now “five or six out and proud voices of climate scepticism in the Senate”. So how did Roberts respond to his newfound fame? Well, he didn’t disappoint, telling every mainstream audience there was “no empirical evidence to show that carbon dioxide affects the climate in any way”.  I’ve written several stories over the years about Roberts and the Galileo Movement – the climate science denial group founded in 2011 with radio personality Alan “climate change is witchcraft” Jones as its patron.  Three years ago I pointed out how One Nation was taking its cues on climate science from Roberts. Last month I suggested that, if elected, Roberts would bring an extreme form of climate science denial to the Senate. But for those paying close attention to climate science denial – such as the string of US senators who spent hours talking about it only last month – Roberts sounds like a broken record. In Roberts’ case, the needle has been stuck for about six years.  What about his conspiracy theories (he says they’re not conspiracies, just facts) that climate change is a scam pushed by global banks looking for cash and the UN on the hunt for global domination? Roberts didn’t disappoint there either.  On ABC Melbourne, host Rafael Epstein asked Roberts: “Do you think the UN’s trying to impose some sort of global government through climate change policy?”  “Definitely,” replied Roberts. “Really?” checked Epstein. “Definitely,” confirmed Roberts.  For years, Roberts has been writing to politicians, government agencies, universities and scientists making the same claim that there is “no empirical evidence” to show fossil fuel burning causes climate change. You can go and read all that material on his website – I’ll see you in six months once you’ve read it all. So what does Roberts mean by “empirical evidence”? According to him, decisions should be based on “observations in the real world … it’s measured, real world data” and nothing else counts.  There are two very obvious problems with Roberts’ argument.  The “real world data” is sending a clear message that the Earth is gaining heat at a rapid rate and that this is a long-term trend. Whether you look at global air temperatures measured in the real world by thermometers or derived from satellites, or the temperature of the oceans at multiple depths, or the increasing frequency of extreme temperatures, or the rising sea levels, the melting ice sheets, the disappearing Arctic sea ice, the increasing risk of bushfires … we could go on and on with a parade of “empirical evidence”. At the same time, humans are adding CO2 to the atmosphere and oceans at a rate that groups like the Geological Society say are unprecedented “even in comparison with the massive injections of carbon to the atmosphere at the Palaeocene-Eocene boundary, which led to a major thermal event 55m years ago”. Roberts’ argument that science is only about “empirical evidence” might sound all sciencey to his interviewees and the lay audience. But it’s bunk.  If all you rely on is “empirical evidence”, and reject modelling and analysis that uses that data, then you basically throw out large swathes of modern scientific endeavours.  Prof Steven Sherwood, director of the Climate Change Research Centre at the University of New South Wales, told me:  The argument is specious. Anyone can claim there is no evidence if they refuse to look at it. In Galileo’s time, some people refused to look into his telescope and then claimed there was no evidence to support what he was saying. Same thing today. The problem is that evidence does not stand up by itself and announce the answer to any given question. Evidence must be interpreted by humans. Scientists have all interpreted the evidence, going back decades, and unanimously agree that it proves beyond a reasonable doubt that (a) humans are increasing CO2 and (b) this is causing warming. There is not a single respectable atmospheric scientist in the world whom I know of, who disagrees with either of these conclusions (there are a handful who challenge the magnitude of the effect but that’s a different question). It is impossible to make a prediction based on data alone. Only a model can make a prediction of anything that has not happened yet. Roberts has built a whole suite of well-rehearsed arguments to enable him to reject any assertions put to him. They go like this, and I’m paraphrasing here. Climate scientists only say it’s warming because if they didn’t their grants would dry up. The Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO have corrupted climate science and are thus guilty of corruption. Government agencies are politicised, which means anything they produce cannot be trusted. You can’t trust climate models, so anything that comes from them should be chucked out. One of Australia’s most famous and celebrated scientists is Prof Peter Doherty, who, in 1996, was jointly awarded a Nobel prize for his research into the immune system.  Doherty told me he had sent Roberts “plenty of reports and material” but Roberts had ignored it. So Doherty has first-hand experience with Roberts and also knows a bit about the scientific method. He told me:  I’ve never used the term ‘empirical evidence’, or heard any other working scientist say it. [Roberts] has no understanding of how science works. Discoveries in science stem from a mix of hypothesis, experiment, data generation, data analysis, insight and even a bit of guesswork. Telling the story of what’s happening in something as complex as climate science further depends on integrating information from a diverse spectrum of fields, then designing to see if the conclusions are valid or false. There’s a constant process of correction and further interpretation that then has to be supported by measurement. You can tell a genuine sceptic from a denier (as I discuss in The Knowledge Wars) because the sceptic will want to look at new data and conclusions and, like any real scientist, will modify their conclusions accordingly. The denier remains ‘locked in’ to a sort of ‘decerebrate rigidity’. All good scientists are sceptical, not least about their own data and conclusions. Further data show that we’re wrong, and we prefer not to be wrong, so people change their positions with new evidence. And, if you want to understand very complex, interactive systems, you have to use modelling approaches. With climate science, data is coming in from a very broad spectrum of scientific disciplines that no one person can pull together ... thus the IPCC. So how should journalists react when a newly-minted senator makes claims that run against science academies across the planet while suggesting institutions and governments the world over – from the US military to the UN – are either part of, or have been hoodwinked by, a conspiracy that only he can and a few other people on the internet are able to see? Deference? Respect? Polite engagement? According to Doherty “you have to respect the institutions of our democracy, including the Australian Senate, but that does not mean you have to respect the viewpoints held by individual senators”. So there is another approach journalists could take. In 2013, Roberts sent one of his voluminous reports to Ben Cubby, then the environment editor at the Sydney Morning Herald. I’ll leave you with Cubby’s response.  In considering your request that I identify errors in the report you sent to me – CSIROh! Climate of Deception? Or First Step to Freedom? – I find myself confronting an unusual problem: how does one critically analyse a pile of horseshit?"

"A series of events sponsored by the oil and gas industry are “polluting” the Democratic national convention with climate denialism and should be boycotted by leading Democrats, according to environmentalists. The American Petroleum Institute (API) has underwritten five events hosted in Philadelphia during the convention by media organizations Politico and the Atlantic.   The events, which promote API’s Vote4Energy campaign, provide delegates and other attendees with literature and signage extolling the benefits of oil and gas drilling. While both Politico and the Atlantic said that API, the US’s leading fossil fuel lobby group, does not hold any sway over the content of the panel discussions, green groups claimed the events have allowed the denial of climate science to seep into the Democratic gathering. “These polluting events have a complete disrespect for the scientific facts and we are very concerned about the influence that fossil fuels have here,” said Brad Johnson, executive director of Climate Hawks Vote, a political action group which has a 10,000-strong petition urging Democrats to boycott the events. The group said it was disappointed the Atlantic and Politico had accepted the lobby group’s money. “API deliberately disseminate misinformation and journalists should have ethical and professional qualms about that,” Johnson said. A batch of documents released earlier this year showed that API was made aware of “serious worldwide environmental changes” caused by the burning of oil and gas more than 45 years ago. Despite this knowledge, the industry funded and encouraged climate denial groups for several decades before finally acknowledging the realities of climate change. The 2016 Democratic platform calls for the Department of Justice to “investigate allegations of corporate fraud on the part of fossil fuel companies accused of misleading shareholders and the public on the scientific reality of climate change”.  Despite this stance, several leading Democrats have agreed to appear at the API-sponsored events. On Wednesday, a Politico event featured Trevor Houser, Clinton’s top energy adviser, alongside John Hickenlooper and Jay Inslee, Democratic governors of Colorado and Washington, respectively. During a somewhat fraught debate, which included several attempted stage invasions by anti-fracking activists and a threat by one Bernie Sanders supporter to pour soup over Houser, each attendee was given booklets produced by API. The literature, called “Principles for American energy progress”, hails a “new era” in free market energy in which increased domestic oil and gas production has lowered energy and gasoline prices. The booklet cites unsourced research that shows 77% of Americans support increased production of oil and gas, including 64% of Democrats.  The booklet, which does not contain the words “climate change”, criticizes regulation and the “shifting of standards to levels that achieve no demonstrable health benefit”. An accompanying website cites the activities that oil and gas make possible, such as picnics.  Jack Gerard, president and chief executive of API, addressed the crowd before the panel talk and praised the impact of “abundant, affordable, clean-burning natural gas” for bringing down America’s total greenhouse gas emissions.  “When you look at the science and data, we can help consumers, help the country and lead the world in environmental protection,” he said, ignoring a cry of “that’s a lie” from a protester.  Politico and the Atlantic also held API-sponsored events at the Republican national convention in Cleveland last week. According to the Intercept, the Washington Post also hosted a climate event, in which Republican congresswoman Marsha Blackburn claimed the world was “cooling down”. In fact there is a clear trend of warming temperatures, with 2016 highly likely to be the warmest year on record. It will beat a mark set in 2015, which itself topped record heat in 2014. Scientists estimate that about three-quarters of all discovered fossil fuels must remain unburned if the world is to avoid disastrous climate change. While natural gas is far less carbon-intensive than coal or oil, it can still lead to significant emissions, particularly if methane is released during drilling. Politico pointed the Guardian to its events policy, which states: “We welcome suggestions from sponsors, however, final decisions about event content remain with the Politico newsroom.” It adds that Politico “does not permit sponsors to sit on panels that they underwrite”. A spokeswoman for the Atlantic said the publication has “full editorial control of what’s on stage at our events; the underwriter plays no role in that part of the process. We make all decisions about our content: speaker and moderator selection, the experience on stage, the questions asked.” She added that the events “bring a range of viewpoints to the stage and never promote one point of view or another”. Neither Politico nor the Atlantic would disclose how much API paid for the sponsorships. A spokesman for API said: “Energy is our candidate, and that is a message we continue to share with all candidates as energy is a major issue for American voters. “We can continue to lead in providing low-cost energy to consumers while improving the environment. They are not mutually exclusive.” Many of the API-funded events have featured politicians and commentators who are in favor of expanding drilling for oil and gas. The Politico panel on Wednesday was more focused on attacking Donald Trump, with Inslee calling the Republican nominee “part of the Flat Earth Society” and Houser labelling the Republican position on climate change “insane”. Gene Karpinski, president of the League of Conservation Voters, said API was trying to “fool the public”. “That’s their business model and they will do all sorts of things to mislead and misinform people to push their own survival as a dirty, dangerous source of fuels,” he said. “We wish that the media could do what they do with their own resources. The API is deceiving the public, acting like climate change doesn’t exist at a time when we are seeing it’s an amazing threat right now with the heatwaves and droughts and forest fires. They are pushing propaganda.” Karpinski, who will speak to the DNC on Thursday before Clinton’s headline speech, said the Democratic platform was “the most aggressive on climate change ever seen”. The platform proposes a swift transition to 100% renewable energy and a price on carbon, although Clinton has yet to fully embrace either of these goals. “We have to make sure that [Clinton] wins and has a Senate that will work with her,” Karpinski said. “Donald Trump would be a disaster for the climate, we can’t let that happen. We will either have a climate change champion or a climate change denier as president. The stakes are that high. I’d argue they’ve never been higher.”"

"The government’s reckless pursuit of fracking has reached new lows with the announcement that ministers will attempt to buy off widespread community opposition to the controversial new fossil fuel source through the introduction of a £1bn Shale Wealth Fund. At a time when we need to be making the transition to a jobs-rich zero-carbon future, this would be a gross violation of the commitments made in Paris last year. Already 2016 is set to be the hottest year on record and without a global step-change we will blow the 1.5C goal within years. Nobody can buy the silence of a climate that is spinning into chaos and turmoil.  Meanwhile, opposition to fracking in the UK is overwhelming, particularly in communities where wells are planned. In Yorkshire, for example, there were 4,375 letters of objection and only 36 of support for the fracking application in Ryedale. Nationally, a recent government survey found that just 19% of people back shale gas exploration in the UK, down from a high of 29% two years ago. Fracking hasn’t happened in the last five years due to local communities standing up and saying no to every well that has been proposed. It’s an insult to those who have fought hard to protect their local environment – and the wider global environment – from the dangers posed by fracking, to suggest they can be bought off like this. Despite ministers trying to shut down the planning process and silence legitimate peaceful protest, local people do still have a powerful voice and are not afraid to use it. To assume their objections are for sale is to misunderstand the principles at stake here. The government would do better to listen to the communities rejecting fracking and to the 10,000 local people who opposed a new opencast mine at Druridge Bay, which will nonetheless go ahead unless the secretary of state steps in to stand up for a safe climate. In order to stay below 2C warming we need to keep around 80% of fossil fuels in the ground. This is a respected and well-established position now endorsed by leading physicians, scientists – and even bankers, including Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England. As a new (and still unproven) source of fossil fuels, fracking is completely incompatible with tackling climate change. The government’s own climate advisers recently published a report suggesting that three tests needed to be met for fracking to proceed safely. None of these tests are anywhere near being achieved. The bigger picture is that fracking is yet another sign of a broken and outdated energy policy – the Hinkley Point C white elephant being the most recent example. Public subsidies for Hinkley are estimated to reach £30bn, while even offshore wind – often thought the most complex and costly form of renewable electricity generation – is now considered a serious and potentially cheaper alternative by the National Audit Office. The only way out of the climate crisis is through a radical transition to a zero-carbon economy based on renewable energy. The public know this – that’s why support for renewables remains high at 81%, with only 4% opposing. Despite this, the UK currently does not have the policies to meet half of its 2030 carbon reduction targets. This needn’t be the case. Since 2009 the costs of solar photovoltaic modules have fallen by 75%, while recent estimates suggest that prices could fall by a further 60% by 2025 if the industry receives the right investment. If we invested in making our homes more energy efficient, we could create 100,000 new jobs, reduce household energy bills by hundreds of pounds, strengthen energy security and reduce carbon emissions. The solutions are in front of us and the benefits for communities near shale gas reserves, such as those in Northumberland and Blackpool, will far outstrip the cash value of what is being offered by the government in bribes. Later this year, the government must publish a new carbon plan that will outline the path to a 57% reduction in emissions by 2030 to meet its commitments under the Climate Change Act. Alongside the decision to embark upon a new industrial strategy, this plan, if taken seriously, could be a real opportunity to put climate change at the heart of government decision-making. Rather than betting on shale gas, which takes us further in the wrong direction, England should follow Wales and Scotland and announce a moratorium on fracking. Then it should do the only thing that makes sense – economically, environmentally and socially: invest in the shared wealth that can be generated by renewable energy and energy efficiency. In other words, invest in the future."

"Climate scientist James Annan and climate economist Chris Hope made a nice sum this year for a bet they made on global warming in 2008. As Hope tells the story: The record warmth of 2015 just made me £1,334 richer. While the extra cash is a nice bonus, it sadly demonstrates that the atmospheric dice remain loaded towards increasing climate change. So, how did I turn increasing temperatures into cash? About five years ago I was at a conference in Cambridge where most of the participants were sceptical about the influence of humans on the climate. I took the microphone and asked if any of them would care to make a £1,000 bet with me about whether 2015 would be hotter than 2008. Two brave souls, Ian Plimer and Sir Alan Rudge, agreed. Like a good economist, Hope hedged his bets. Plimer and Rudge had given him even odds, and Hope found a climate scientist, James Annan, who gave him 4-to-1 odds on the opposite wager: I asked him what odds he would give me. In 2011, he was confident enough in the reality of climate change to offer me odds of 4 to 1 against 2015 being cooler than 2008 ... now I was perfectly hedged: I would win £1,333 if 2015 were cooler than 2008, and £1,334 if it were warmer. 2015 was of course hotter than 2008, so Plimer and Rudge each lost £1,000, with £1,334 going to Hope and £666 going to Annan on Hope’s hedged bet. While research has shown that betting against global warming is generally a great way to lose money, this particular bet was especially foolish. 2008 saw a strong La Niña event, which cause ocean surface and therefore global surface temperatures to temporarily cool. It was the coolest year since 2000 - what mathematicians call a “local minimum” because the temperature was lower than all the nearby years. And the bet was made about 5 years ago, so the participants knew that. Between 2008 and 2015 there would be more than 0.1°C of human-caused global warming, so for 2015 to be cooler would have required a huge La Niña event, or big volcanic eruption, or perhaps the contrarians were banking on human-caused global warming being wrong.  Whatever their reasoning, it was a foolish bet to make. 2015 was a record-breaking hot year, about 0.32°C hotter than 2008. It wasn’t even close. In fact, it’s quite possible that we won’t see another year as cool as 2008 in our lifetimes. 2011 saw a big La Niña event, but it was still significantly warmer than 2008. The further away that year gets in the rear-view mirror, the more global warming humans are causing, and the less likely we’ll see another year as cool as 2008. It’s worth noting that the two individuals who made this bet - Ian Plimer and Alan Rudge - are both members of the Global Warming Policy Foundation academic advisory board. The GWPF is a UK anti-climate advocacy group that generally relies upon unreliable sources of climate information. That their advisors make such foolish wagers does not inspire confidence in the group. It’s easy for those who deny the threats associated with human-caused global warming to talk a big game. For their efforts they’re often paid handsomely via the web of denial, media outlets that practice false balance give them undeserved prominence, and in most cases they’re old men who won’t live to see the worst consequences resulting from their efforts to delay climate action. Climate scientists want to change this by engaging them in more bets like Hope’s. My colleagues and I managed to engage a group of contrarians in a wager that in the satellite estimates of the temperature of the Earth’s lower atmosphere, 2011–2020 (so far, a 0.27°C anomaly) will be hotter than 2001–2010 (0.22°C). Our side was willing to put up nearly three times more money (for charity) than the contrarians. Not surprisingly, we already have a comfortable lead.  At this year’s American Geophysical Union conference - the largest gathering of climate scientists in the world - several scientists are holding a session on this very topic (Annan is one of the invited speakers): Opponents of science-informed policy cite uncertainty as a reason to delay action. Mainstream science acknowledges and objectively quantifies uncertainty, whereas opponents often use the language of certainty. Because communication is typically more persuasive when a message is conveyed with certitude, contrary voices may appear stronger than scientific voices to the public. To redress this imbalance, we must find a way to determine whether expressed opinions represent true opinions. One longstanding method is through wagering, and this session will examine the role of bets in exposing actual beliefs related to climate change and associated risk.  In other words, if you’re as confident as Plimer and Rudge that global warming is nothing to worry about, put your money where your mouth is like they did. Chris Hope also discussed the possibility of implementing climate betting markets, and noted: they could offer a financial incentive for people who disagree about the likelihood of climate change to carefully assess the risks, instead of just shouting their disagreement across the void. If we do nothing, all the signs are that dangerous climate change is one of the safest bets around."
"Brad Lorge began his entrepreneurial journey helping charities more effectively coordinate the collection of food from supermarkets and warehouses.  Now the software engineer is the co-founder of Premonition, a logistics optimisation firm helping online retailers and shipping companies meet heightened consumer expectations and develop more sustainable supply chains.   While optimisation and fleet planning software isn’t new to the logistics industry, Lorge says Premonition’s platform is unique globally, and is already helping to manage the deployment of thousands of vehicles on Australian roads, saving tens of thousands of kilometres each day.  Lorge and some of his classmates at the University of New South Wales developed an early version of the optimisation technology in 2011. The team received support from CSIRO’s Data 61 business unit and Microsoft, after they placed third globally in the 2013 Microsoft Imagine Cup. Premonition’s technology can optimise large job sets, rerouting multiple vehicles in real-time based on a plethora of factors: changed traffic conditions, weather, delivery windows, incoming orders and returns, truck capacity, a driver’s final destination and consumer requests such as redirected parcels. Machine learning means it can also predict changes that might disrupt the normal sequence of a logistics chain, helping solve problems for couriers before they arise.  “It adapts as new information becomes available,” Lorge says. “If there were a major accident or a new order came in, we could reroute an entire fleet of thousands of vehicles in a split second, if that was the right thing to do in that moment.” Lorge says the software application has typically resulted in a 5% to 15% reduction in the number of kilometres driven each day by a given fleet, to achieve the same outcomes.  Premonition is working with close to a dozen Australian clients, including several “household names” with fleets in the range of 2,000-plus vehicles, according to Lorge.  Logistics makes up about 10% of Australia’s GDP, and delivery vehicles are a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and traffic congestion in cities. The transportation sector, including the movement of passengers and goods, accounts for 16% of all GHG emissions in Australia. In the US, transportation accounts for 26%, second only to power generation. And for a fleet of 2,000 vehicles, if you assume 100km a day is a standard travelling distance for each vehicle, even a 5% reduction is equivalent to 10,000km a day or about 3.6m km a year. Being able to reduce travel distances “even by a small percentage can have a significant impact on the environment”, Lorge says. He says Premonition’s approach is to think “about logistics as a service to consumers rather than just a network of trucks”. “For good reason, and because the technology wasn’t available, logistics networks are backwards,” he says. Companies have conventionally built their processes and networks to handle large volumes of goods and move them as quickly as possible. Once upon a time this aligned with the expectations of retailers “but the market has evolved dramatically”. Consumers now have heightened expectations which need to be factored into the design of more sustainable logistics networks.   “Today, mobile consumers want to be in control, they want to see and understand what’s happening with their delivery in real time, and they want more options and flexibility about when and where their delivery will arrive.”  Premonition’s tools help shipping companies communicate directly with consumers and hit tighter delivery windows, with some clients providing windows inside 30 minutes.  Lorge calls the platform “Uber for couriers” – drivers and managers have an application to optimise their workflow, while consumers have an app to track their deliveries and make last-minute decisions about drop-off locations.  In future, Premonition plans on working with cities to reduce traffic congestion and improve logistical management of other municipal services and activities. Lorge says there have already been preliminary discussions with local councils in Australia about the improved management of loading zones, and incentives for shipping companies to meet tighter delivery windows, such as waived toll fees. But developing solutions that are tailored for cities will require considerable time and energy. To realistically expand into this domain and have a meaningful impact, Premonition will need to expand its team of nine employees.  Dr Jyoti Bhattacharjya, a lecturer in logistics and supply chain management at the University of Sydney, says route optimisation software can help logistics companies become more efficient but it’s only one component of a much larger problem. She says logistics companies have to invest in fleet upgrades, including trucks that run on cleaner fuels or electricity, as well as warehouse automation. Bhattacharjya says Australia’s logistics sector has been slower to transition to more sustainable practices than certain overseas markets owing to a lack of incentive. “In the US a large online retailer like Amazon can afford to challenge established, large logistics players like UPS, which forces a shift to ‘greener’ operations,” she says. “In Australia, the competitive landscape is very different. “As competition and consumer awareness grows, and as legislators get into the picture and start mandating smarter, greener cities, I think this will change.” One catalyst could be social media. “Logistics companies were invisible as part of the retailer’s operations before social media,” she says. “But it’s not a behind-the-scenes business any more.”  She adds: “Now, everything that a logistics company gets wrong is there for every other consumer to see.” With this increased visibility, she says it’s likely consumers will start to demand from retailers that their goods are transported in more sustainable ways. “Logistics companies will need to evolve, or what we’ll end up with is a lot of mergers, and a lot of Australian-based companies bought out by foreign investors, who have learned to do it better.”"

"Earlier this month, an outbreak of anthrax in northern Russia caused the death of a 12-year-old boy and his grandmother and put 90 people in the hospital. These deadly spores – which had not been seen in the Arctic since 1941 – also spread to 2,300 caribou. Russian troops trained in biological warfare were dispatched to the Yamalo-Nenets region to evacuate hundreds of the indigenous, nomadic people and quarantine the disease. Americans are likely to associate anthrax with the mysterious white powder that was mailed to news media and US Senate offices in the weeks following 11 September 2001. The bacteria – usually sequestered in biological weapons labs – killed five people and infected 17 others in the most devastating bioterrorism attack in US history.   But in Russia, the spread of illness was not the result of bioterrorism; it was a result of global warming. Record-high temperatures melted Arctic permafrost and released deadly anthrax spores from a thawing carcass of a caribou that had been infected 75 years ago and had stayed frozen in limbo until now. This all suggests that it may not be easy to predict which populations will be most vulnerable to the health impacts of climate change.  In 2013, the National Academy of Sciences hosted a forum on the influence of global environmental change on infectious diseases. In his keynote speech, Dr Jonathan Patz stood in front of a large slide of a mosquito and warned: “Global warming’s greatest threat may also be the smallest.” The forum focused on many causes of disease, from fungi, bacteria, viruses and mold spores, to vectors like bats and mosquitoes. Climate change can exacerbate the spread of infectious disease by changing the behavior, lifespans and regions of diseases and their carriers. This can sometimes be hard to prove directly. It can be challenging, for example, to isolate the avenues by which climate change drives emerging infections in warm climates where travel, trade, land use and dense urban living can all lead to the spread of disease. At other times, the signal is bright. Looking way up north in the Arctic – where there are far fewer people, less travel and trade, and fewer infectious diseases – the signal that climate change is a source of disease outbreaks is clear.  It is usually so cold in the tundra that the ground is perennially frozen in deep layers that can date back 3m years. But the usual circumstances no longer apply at the top of the world. The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the globe. In fact, the area of the anthrax outbreak was 18F (10C) hotter than average, with temperatures reaching 95F (35C). In addition to releasing ancient microbes, melting layers of permafrost also release methane, a greenhouse gas 30 times more potent than carbon dioxide, that in turn causes further warming. It is not just animal carcasses that are thawing. Indigenous groups living in the tundra do not bury their dead deep underground, opting instead for wooden coffins arranged in above-ground cemeteries. This raises the potential for infections to spread from this source as well.  Could some of the severe infectious diseases that have threatened the planet in the past be reactivated as our northernmost regions thaw? It’s not just climate scientists that are concerned about the health threats of a warming world. Public health experts and physicians are also speaking out. The Lancet Commission released a report in 2015 asserting that climate change could reverse the last 50 years of public health advances.  As risk is added to risk, the signals of our changing climate underscore the urgent need to put climate change solutions in place. Even more than we know, our health may depend on it."
"The world is careening towards an environment never experienced before by humans, with the temperature of the air and oceans breaking records, sea levels reaching historic highs and carbon dioxide surpassing a key milestone, a major international report has found. The “state of the climate” report, led by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) with input from hundreds of scientists from 62 countries, confirmed there was a “toppling of several symbolic mileposts” in heat, sea level rise and extreme weather in 2015.  “The impacts of climate change are no longer subtle,” Michael Mann, a leading climatologist at Penn State, told the Guardian. “They are playing out before us, in real time. The 2015 numbers drive that home.” Last year was the warmest on record, with the annual surface temperature beating the previous mark set in 2014 by 0.1C. This means that the world is now 1C warmer than it was in pre-industrial times, largely due to a huge escalation in the production of greenhouse gases. The UN has already said that 2016 is highly likely to break the annual record again, after 14 straight months of extreme heat aided by a hefty El Niño climatic event, a weather event that typically raises temperatures around the world. The oceans, which absorb more than 90% of the extra CO2 pumped into the atmosphere, also reached a new record temperature, with sharp spikes in the El Niño-dominated eastern Pacific, which was 2C warmer than the long-term average, and the Arctic, where the temperature in August hit a dizzying 8C above average. The thermal expansion of the oceans, compounded by melting glaciers, resulted in the highest global sea level on record in 2015. The oceans are around 70mm higher than the 1993 average, which is when comprehensive satellite measurements of sea levels began. The seas are rising at an average rate of 3.3mm a year, with the western Pacific and Indian Oceans experiencing the fastest increases. These changes are being driven by a CO2 concentration that surpassed the symbolic 400 parts per million mark at the Mauna Loa research station in Hawaii last year. The Noaa report states that the global CO2 level was a touch under this, at 399.4ppm, an increase of 2.2ppm compared to 2014. Noaa said other “remarkable” changes in 2015 include the Arctic’s lowest maximum sea ice extent in the 37-year satellite record, recorded in February 2015. The world’s alpine glaciers recorded a net annual loss of ice for the 36th consecutive year and the Greenland ice sheet, which would balloon sea levels by around 7m should it disintegrate, experienced melting over more than 50% of its surface. The rapid changes in the climate may have profound consequences for humans and other species. In June last year, a severe heatwave claimed over 1,000 lives in Karachi, Pakistan. Severe drought caused food shortages for millions of people in Ethiopia, with a lack of rainfall resulting in “intense and widespread” forest fires in Indonesia that belched out a vast quantity of greenhouse gas. Diminishing sea ice is causing major walrus herds to haul themselves out on to land. Arctic marine species, such as snailfish and polar cod, are being pushed out of the region by species coming from further south, attracted to the warming waters. A huge algal bloom off the west coast of North America harmed marine life and fisheries. Scientists have said there were underlying climate change trends at play but last year was also influenced by the strong El Niño event, which is when equatorial Pacific waters warm, leading to an array of weather effects around the world. El Niño has also helped spur searing heat in 2016 but has now petered out. Thomas Karl, director of Noaa national centers for environmental information, said that last year’s climate “was shaped both by long-term change and an El Niño event. When we think about being climate resilient, both of these time scales are important to consider. “Last year’s El Niño was a clear reminder of how short-term events can amplify the relative influence and impacts stemming from longer-term warming trends.” Kate Willett, a senior scientist at Britain’s Met Office, said that there was a 75% annual increase in the amount of land that experienced severe drought last year.  “Looking at a range of climate measurements, 2015 was yet another highly significant year,” she said. “Not only was 2015 the warmest year on record by a large margin, it was also another year when the levels of dominant greenhouse gases reached new peaks.”  The state of the climate report is now in its 26th year. The peer-reviewed series is published annually by the American Meteorological Society. "
"When you walk the aisles of your favourite shop you are bombarded with labels attempting to explain why this product is so much better than those others. It can be overwhelming, and it’s neither a new problem nor one that’s getting better; there are currently at least 465 different eco-labels in use around the globe according to the EcoLabel Index. Enter a potential new one: net positive. It’s a concept that has been around for a while, but a new project, backed by companies including Dell, Kingfisher and Dow Chemical, aims to boost its use and make it clearer to understand.  It’s an opportunity for companies to demonstrate their positive social and environmental impact. However, the jury is still out on whether the majority of consumers will understand it. While net positive is broadly understood to be a promise by business to “put more into society than we take out”, there is a fear that without some governance, it has the potential to become a throwaway marketing term with little to no underlying meaning, says John Pflueger, principal environmental strategist at Dell. So, what exactly is net positive? At its core, it involves measuring a company’s impacts as a result of its operations and products. The positive impacts – anything from reduced greenhouse gas emissions due to fuel-efficient vehicles to the social benefits resulting from good supply chain practices – are the company’s handprint, or what a company adds to the world. A footprint is what it takes away.  For technology company Dell, which has been reporting its social and environmental impacts for more than a decade, net positive can be a way to encourage it to do more. In 2013, Dell announced its aim to make its overall positive impacts 10 times greater than its negative impacts by 2020. It has attempted to do this with a net positive assessment of the impacts of its programme that helps employees work from home. The immediate benefit of the scheme is to improve employees’ work-life balance. It also found a greenhouse-gas benefit, with the handprint of the scheme more than 200 times greater than its footprint, according to the company. It saves 1.15 metric tons of emissions per employee per year (for example by reducing the days they commute to an office, as well as reducing Dell’s need for office space and the costs and emissions that go with it). The emissions associated with implementing the programme (such as increased energy use in the data centres powering software to connect remote employees) are just 0.0057 metric tons of emissions per year. Calculating this top-line result, however, required a level of expertise and effort that would be daunting to most companies. And it could be just as hard, if not impossible, to communicate such complexity on product packaging. “You might not buy a product that says ‘this product is 5x net positive’ because it’s hard for a consumer to know what that means, but you might see a product that says ‘this product achieves XYZ, or this product is net positive because...’”, says David Korngold of US non-profit BSR. Regardless of whether it appears on a label or not, net positive – at least by the definition being created by the project members – is expected to deepen an individual company’s sustainability efforts. “You can’t figure out your net positive impact in a vacuum,” says Korngold. “You have to figure out how your products and solutions are affecting other companies and consumers.” Net positive could also reframe the way companies view their sustainability work. Josh Prigge, the director of regenerative development at Fetzer Vineyards, a major wine producer in California, explains the difference between traditional sustainability goals and a net positive mindset. “If a company just says, ‘our big goal is to reduce greenhouse gases by 20%, or reduce water by 20%, or energy by 20%’ ... then you’re still 80% bad,” Prigge says. “I think the goal should be for everyone to be net positive and completely eliminate their negative impacts.” Fetzer says communicating its net positive commitment to wine shoppers may never take the form of on-bottle labelling or messaging, but it is in its overall brand communication and how the company defines its impact. In the meantime, all that’s left to be worked out in calculating net positive, is well just about everything, says Pflueger. Its partners in the new project will need to develop methodologies for specific areas like water and greenhouse gases as well as guidance for companies that want to set net positive goals. And because every company will need to address different social and environmental impacts to reach net positive, members will be casting a wide net in their approaches. It’s this vague definition that is potentially problematic says Andrew Crane, director of the Centre for Business, Organisations and Society at Bath University: “The net positive idea is exciting because it challenges companies to think hard about their overall impact on society rather than just in terms of specific social responsibility initiatives. The challenge though will be to develop meaningful, auditable metrics that go beyond self-serving rhetoric. If the members are serious about doing that it could be game changing.” Pflueger admits “there are far more questions now with regards to net positive than there are answers”. “But we if don’t start working on these, we’re not going to get anywhere. We don’t want to use the fact that we don’t fully understand this as an excuse for inaction.”"

" The climate sceptic Liberal MP Craig Kelly has been appointed chairman of the backbench environment and energy committee, with National party MP Kevin Hogan as secretary. The committee will provide feedback on legislation and policies relating to the environment and energy, including to the minister, Josh Frydenberg.  Kelly served on the committee during the last parliament and previously invited climate sceptics to “balance” a presentation given by top climate scientists. He has been writing on the issue for a number of years, noting that the convicts found it hotter in the 1700s. “But I wonder if any of these people actually knew that Sydney’s so-called ‘record hot day’ on Tuesday 8th Jan this year [2013], that had them screaming “Global Warming”, was actually COOLER than the weather experienced by the convicts of the First Fleet in Sydney way back in the summer of 1790/91?” Kelly wrote. He wrote on his Facebook page during the election campaign: “And with freezing temperatures and even snow forecast for Melbourne’s outskirts and in parts of New South Wales, I hope many of the warmists haven’t sold their coats.” Hogan holds the marginal seat of Page on the New South Wales north coast. He has opposed coal seam gas development in his area.  The appointments were part of the political housekeeping required by the return of parliament after the election. The Coalition party room elected all the backbench committees and those with legislation to scrutinise met immediately to consider the bills. Flanked by the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, and the deputy Liberal leader, Julie Bishop, Malcolm Turnbull addressed the joint party room when it reconvened after lunch for another meeting to consider policy issues such as the contentious superannuation changes. West Australian Liberal Nola Marino has been reappointed as chief government whip along with South Australian Liberal Rowan Ramsey and Queensland Liberal Bert van Manen. Ramsey and van Manen replace Queensland Liberal Ewen Jones and Tasmanian Liberal Brett Whiteley, both of whom lost their seats in the election."
"By 2030, Canada intends to see its greenhouse gas emissions fall 30% from the 2005 levels of 749 megatonnes. To get there, the country expects its businesses to play an important role in a new plan that will include a program to make companies pay for their carbon emissions. Under the new government, led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Canada expects to unveil a carbon pricing program as early as this fall. “We’re going to make sure there is a strong price on carbon right across the country,” Trudeau said during a TV interview last week.  The announcement of a carbon pricing program represents a dramatic departure from the previous administration under Stephen Harper, who championed the expansion of the country’s oil industry and sidelined climate change causes. The current emissions reduction goal in Canada – 30% by 2030 – came from the Harper era and falls far below those set by the European Union and the US. Carbon pricing can be an effective weapon against global warming. But it’s also a concept that historically has drawn a lukewarm reception from businesses, which tend to fight its financial impact on them. The two most commonly used carbon pricing systems are carbon tax and the so-called cap-and-trade. A tax would simply set a price for each ton of greenhouse gas emitted. A cap-and-trade will set limits on the amount of emissions that businesses can release and give them permits for the allotted amount. Those that emit above their limits will have to buy permits from companies that pollute below the limits. Carbon pricing programs typically focus on regulating heavy polluters such as power plant owners, oil refineries, big factories and airlines. Around 40 countries and more than 20 cities, states and regions are putting in place or already have a price on carbon, which translates to 12% of global emissions and an annual value of $50bn, according to the World Bank. The European Union runs the world’s largest cap-and-trade program, launched in 2005, which involves 31 countries and covers 45% of its greenhouse gas emissions. The US Congress attempted to create a carbon pricing program after Barack Obama became president but failed to gain enough support. The business community is typically reluctant to support any taxes or policy that will cost them money. For example, the carbon tax levied by the province of British Columbia, Canada, has drawn criticism from cement makers, who contend that the tax hurts their ability to remain competitive and gives cement exporters from China and the US an unfair advantage because they don’t have to pay the tax. But a study from researchers at Duke University and the University of Ottawa that looked at the effect of British Columbia’s carbon tax on its overall economy concluded that it had “little net impact”. Carbon pricing could become more widely used as nations start to figure out ways to achieve the goal of the Paris climate agreement to keep temperature increases at below 2C. That likelihood has prompted some businesses to band together to try to and shape carbon pricing legislation. One such effort in Canada comes from the Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition, which lined up 20 Canadian companies as members earlier this month, including Air Canada and IKEA Canada. At least 435 firms, including Microsoft, Google and BP have voluntarily set their own internal price on emissions, up from 150 companies in 2014, according to the Carbon Disclosure Project, which works with businesses to measure their greenhouse gas emissions. Assigning values to their own emissions can help businesses better manage environmental risks, make investment decisions to reduce them and get ready for legislation on carbon pricing. Policymakers hope carbon pricing will also spark innovations that lower emissions, such as technology to capture pollutants from power plants before they get into the atmosphere. John Stackhouse, a senior vice president at the Royal Bank of Canada, the country’s biggest bank and a new member of the Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition, said carbon pricing is good for ensuring a business’s longevity. “There’s a strong consensus among Canadian business that carbon pricing can actually be a business friendly approach to better managing the planet’s carbon resources,” Stackhouse said. Whether a carbon pricing program will be effective in Canada will depend largely how the government structures the program and sets the prices. The government has yet to reveal much about the program, though it’s likely that it will set a minimum carbon price that provinces must meet, and each jurisdiction will be allowed to decide what type of pricing scheme they will follow, said Mark Thurber, associate director of the Program on Energy and Sustainable Development at Stanford University. Trudeau’s carbon pricing program won’t be the only one within Canada. Four of the country’s 10 provinces either already have a carbon pricing scheme in place, or are in the process of introducing one. Having a national program on top of regional efforts, which run on different rules, could draw protests from businesses and the regional governments, said Benjamin Dachis, associate director of research at the CD Howe Institute, a Canadian public policy thinktank. “Outsiders need to remember the immense power of provincial governments here,” Dachis said. “There are deep questions about what the federal government needs to do on top of or in place of provinces.” Carbon prices vary considerably around the world, from less than $1 per tonne of emissions in countries such as Mexico to $130 per tonne in Sweden, with 85% of countries pricing carbon at below $10. Thurber believes Canada will set the price at around $15 per tonne. “It’s been pretty well established that that’s a level that drives some abatement activities but the economic impact is fairly minor,” he said. “It’s big enough to be meaningful but it’s not going to cripple them in the slightest.” The business community hopes the government will craft a business-friendly program, said Stackhouse. Transparency is critical, he said, especially in setting clear prices and the rules for how they might increase in the years ahead. “Consumers and shareholders, as well as regulators, have a greater awareness of the carbon risks to the economy. We don’t think that level of interest is going to decline,” Stackhouse said."
"When the government’s Airports Commission endorsed the expansion of Heathrow last year it was challenged to explain how the UK could expand its airports without breaking climate change laws that limit greenhouse gas emissions. It was a reasonable question. Like most countries, the UK has a tough emissions target for 2050 and, even though aviation has been given an easy ride compared with other industries, the sector is on course to exceed its generous limit. That’s the case even without adding a new runway. Increasing the number of flights from the UK would put the target further out of reach. Undeterred, the commission responded with reassurance that we can build a new runway without breaking our climate limits. Its confidence seems to have put most people off looking into the details: that and the way the commission scattered, across hundreds of pages in several different publications, its explanation of how it had achieved what seemed impossible. Analysis that I co-authored might help explain why the commission appeared so reluctant to spell out its workings. In fact, it’s hard to imagine a less popular way of winning public support for a new runway than its suggestion for how expansion could avoid breaking our climate limits. The essence of the commission’s suggestion is simple, even if the details are difficult to pin down. It proposed that the government could allow a new runway to be built without busting the emissions cap, by hiking the cost of tickets so fewer people can afford to fly. Its idea is to build a new runway in London then increase prices so that demand for flights falls, particularly at airports in poorer parts of the country.  No one can say precisely how big the price increase would need to be to keep the country within its limits, because it depends on how quickly flight technology improves, but today’s report estimates how much more tickets might have to cost. If technology to make planes more fuel-efficient progresses as quickly as the commission optimistically suggests, a return ticket to New York – from any UK airport, not just the one with the new runway – would become about £270 more expensive after a new runway is built. But if technology moves more slowly, as many analysts think it will, the flight could cost £850 more. Price increases like these would spell the end of budget flying; long-haul trips would be affordable only to the rich. People worried about climate change shouldn’t kid themselves that this is a realistic solution to the emissions problems a new runway brings. It’s near-impossible to imagine the government putting such a high price on flying purely to protect the environment: after all, it couldn’t bring itself to increase fuel duty for drivers this year despite two years of falling prices. It’s far more likely that a new runway – and the rest of the UK’s airport capacity – will be used, busting our climate limits. If the runway really is built, the best hope of keeping flights affordable without breaking our climate targets may be for the government to tax frequent fliers at a higher rate than those going on holiday just once or twice a year, so more people can still travel. This approach was outlined last year by A Free Ride and could be the cleanest and fairest answer, but would depend on a level of serious political engagement with this challenge that has so far been absent.  Sometime soon the government will finally make a decision about a new runway. To many, it seems the question of how the runway can avoid breaking our climate change law has been resolved, but in fact, all we’ve had is a series of possibilities. We should understand where the path leads before taking a step into the dark."

"It is very commendable that George Monbiot has converted to veganism (Opinion, 10 August), but perhaps he is deluding himself into thinking that this will alter our output of CO2 into the atmosphere. We can practise all the accepted methods of reducing carbon emissions, but nothing is more effective than choosing to have no more than two children. As we hurtle towards the point of no return with regards to global warming, choosing not to eat meat is quite low down the scale of things we need to do. Which are: 1 Stabilise world population. 2 Eradicate poverty. 3 Stop using fossil fuels and change to renewables. 4 Use our land to produce crops more effectively. 5 Reduce excessive meat consumption.  We need to get over the taboo against discussing population growth and face the facts. The most effective national and global climate change strategy that governments can put into action is to limit the size of our population, in a non-coercive way with better family planning and education.Sheena HowarthWorcester • I am a fairly experienced organic farmer. I have just 100 acres of land in an area of outstanding natural beauty. It is chalk downland and on it I rear 30 or 40 beef shorthorn cattle, an old and noble native breed that has been recently recognised for its ability to thrive and fatten on grassland. I use no artificial fertiliser derived from fossil fuels and depend entirely on the manure that the cattle produce when they lie on straw in the barn during the winter. This way I can replenish the land and its fertility. I also have a vegetable garden and this too depends on the manure to boost the quality of the soil, to make it friable and moisture retentive. So when Mr Monbiot declares that he will have no truck with animal products, I am at a loss as to how he or any vegan imagines that vegetables, or indeed grain, can be grown without animal manure – unless it is with artificial fertilisers. With a lot of care and attention, it is possible to produce enough compost to nurture a veg garden – but a whole field of wheat, oat or barley? When Lady Balfour founded the Soil Association, the health of the soil was at the basis of her philosophy. I firmly believe that organic farming can strike the balance between consumption of animal products and caring for the environment. I was horrified by the story of the river pollution in Devon and hope that the dairy farm in question was not organic because we really do have some very strict rules and are inspected to enforce these. In any case, the CAP rules also regulate emissions from farms and if these are broken one would expect the farmer to be fined and subsidies to be severely reduced. What I would really like is a reply from someone who grows 20 acres of wheat on thin soil without the use of animal manure. Maybe this rara avis exists. But meantime I look down on the hundreds of tons of rich FYM ( farmyard manure lying waiting to be spread in the autumn and feel that this recycling is the best way of maintaining the soil whose health in turn ensures that of man and beast whether wild or domestic.Penny ReidWantage, Oxfordshire • I wish that anti-meat-eaters would stop making veganism look such a no-brainer. George Monbiot states that “replacing meat with soya reduces the clearance of natural vegetation, per kilogram of protein, by 96%”. It actually reduces it in Britain by 100% because, unlike most meat we eat in the UK, soya can’t be grown here at all, so it is 100% imported. No wonder we’d apparently use so little agricultural land to support a nation of vegans. But what about food security?David MillsYork • George Monbiot does not mention the other big existential threat facing our species. The huge amount of antibiotics fed to animals means that the consumers of meat are becoming immune to them. This is a nightmare scenario and diseases that were brought under control over the last 100 years are reappearing. People are already dying as antibiotics are no longer working. Because George consumes milk, fish and meat albeit occasionally he cannot be counted a vegetarian or a vegan. Perhaps he needs to look at the compassionate factor of not eating animals.Nitin MehtaLondon • On a recent train journey from Reading to Devon – having attended a conference spelling out the many benefits of a plant-based diet for people with multiple sclerosis – I couldn’t help but notice the vast majority of our countryside is dedicated to the production of meat and dairy products which George Monbiot quite rightly describes as the reason we need to import so much food, create so much pollution and indeed, ill health. I have MS, and have benefited from a plant-based, no-sugar diet. The NHS would be able to cope with capacity to spare if less dairy, meat and sugar were consumed. The UK would be self-sufficient in food and it might even become possible to meet our climate change obligations with sustainable production. I wonder what a train trip of our country would look like with a nation of vegans. More woodland, more wetlands, more wildlife, more jobs, more diversity, and smaller hospitals. This would be a big improvement on the “green desert” passing the railway window at the moment.Dr Colin BannonCrapstone, Devon  • Two cases involving what appears to be uninformed parenting are no grounds to throw parents of vegan children behind bars (Parents who feed children vegan diet face prosecution under proposed Italian law, theguardian.com, 10 August). Vegan foods – which are cholesterol-free, low in saturated fat, and rich in complex carbohydrates, protein, fibre, vitamins, and minerals – are optimal for children. The late Dr Benjamin Spock, a leading authority on childcare, spoke out against feeding animal-derived foods to children, advising that they can cause diabetes and, in the long term, set kids up for obesity, cancer, high blood pressure and heart disease. He also held that consuming plant-based foods forms the foundation of dietary habits that support a lifetime of good health. This is one of the many reasons why countless conscientious parents have raised or are raising healthy babies on well-planned, nutritionally complete vegan diets – and our children are thriving.

"Wildlife lovers are being asked to spend 15 minutes in a wood this week to chart the spread of the speckled wood (Pararge aegeria), Britain’s most successful butterfly. The speckled wood is one of a handful of species that appear to be benefitting from climate change, recently colonising East Anglia, the Midlands and much of northern England, increasing in abundance by 84% over the past 40 years. The southern population has expanded northwards at an average of four miles a year since the 1970s.  The butterfly has also ventured into the Irish Sea to reach the Isle of Man and spread across Scotland, where in the 1970s it was restricted to the mild west coast and the Moray firth. It may even be about to establish itself on the Outer Hebrides. As part of this year’s Big Butterfly Count, Butterfly Conservation and the Tree Charter - a campaign to help protect the UK’s woodlands and wildlife - are asking the public to visit a local wood and record the speckled woods and other butterflies they see. Results from the Big Butterfly Count, the world’s biggest annual insect count, will help scientists to understand why the speckled wood has thrived when three-quarters of Britain’s 59 native butterfly species are in decline. “It’s a species that’s doing well but it’s also doing interesting things,” said Richard Fox of Butterfly Conservation. “Sightings in northern England, southern Scotland, Scottish islands and the far north are particularly important – you might discover a new area in which the speckled wood has never been found before. But we welcome sightings from everywhere so we can measure how well the speckled wood is doing nationally.” The speckled wood, which flies in partially shaded woodland of dappled sunlight, appears to be a harbinger of a much milder and wetter climate. According to lepidopterists, woods traditionally shelter speckled wood caterpillars from the harshest winter weather and the driest summer weather, when trees provide vital shade for the grasses on which the caterpillars feed. When conditions are mild and damp enough, such as in its traditional stronghold of Devon, the speckled wood can move beyond woodlands and live in leafy lanes and gardens. As climate change brings milder, damper conditions to eastern and northern Britain, the speckled wood has expanded. Scientific studies of the butterfly have revealed that individuals living in newly colonised areas have developed larger thoraxes – containing their flight muscles – increasing their flight strength and making them more successful at dispersing into new territory. There’s an evolutionary tradeoff, however: these muscular migrants lay fewer eggs than the more sedentary speckled woods living at the core of its traditional range. Last year, just 4% of Big Butterfly Counts took place in woodland, which are important for many butterflies, including threatened species such as the wood white, black hairstreak and pearl-bordered fritillary. “Woodlands are vital for many butterfly and moth species as well as being beautiful places to explore and discover nature,” said Fox. “This summer let’s all try to do an extra ‘count’ in a local wood. A woodland count will help us understand how common butterflies are faring in our woods.” Sir David Attenborough, the president of Butterfly Conservation, said: “The sight of a specked wood flitting through the dappled sunlight of woodland glade is a memorable high-summer spectacle. “Sadly, our woodlands face a multitude of threats from habitat loss to climate change and various tree diseases. Spend 15 minutes counting butterflies in your local woodland and help us build a picture of how we can help protect woodland butterflies.”"

"Over the last six weeks, scientists have published two major reports on coral reef resilience that appear to contradict each other. The first - “Bright spots among the world’s coral reefs” was produced by 39 scientists led by Professor Josh Cinner of James Cook University in Australia and drew on data from 6000 reef surveys from all over the world. Cinner et al concluded that those reefs that were sustainably managed had a much better chance of withstanding bleaching impacts related to global warming and periodic climate events like El Niño. The second however suggested remote coral reefs not subject to human stressors like overfishing or pollution were faring no better than those close to populated areas and that ecosystems management made no real difference to the overall health of reefs. So which is right?   “Coral reef degradation is not correlated with local human population density,” by Professor John Bruno and co-author Abel Valdivia of the University of North Carolina was published on 20 July. It suggests that contrary to prevailing scientific opinion, local pressures do not act synchronously with global stressors (most notably warming) and that their impact on reefs is negligible. According to Valdivia “Widespread arguments that coral reef degradation is mostly caused by local factors are unsupported. We found the problem is better explained by global impacts such as climate change.”   This is controversial because it throws into question the efficacy of current marine conservation strategies that attempt to mitigate human impacts and the “widespread argument that human-dominated reefs can be made more resilient to global stressors.” The overriding message is a simple one according to the report’s author & lead researcher John Bruno - it “illustrates the far-reaching effects of global warming and the immediate need for drastic and sustained cuts in carbon emissions to help restore the health of coral reefs.”  The first report - published in June - identified 35 “dark spots” where coral reefs were suffering the greatest degradation and 15 “bright spots” that were, if not flourishing, certainly faring better than most. Many of these bright spots are in the Coral Triangle in countries like Indonesia, the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea.  Like Bruno & Valdivia, Cinner et al found that remote reefs did not necessarily fare better than those close to high population densities. What they did find though is that bright spots tend to be in locations where local communities have ancestral systems of reef tenure that protect fishing grounds from outsiders (such as West Papua in eastern Indonesia and some Pacific countries). The paper found that far from over-harvesting their reefs, these communities were acting as custodians.  “Bright spots are characterized by strong sociocultural institutions such as customary taboos and marine tenure, high levels of local engagement in management, high dependence on marine resources, and beneficial environmental conditions such as deep-water refuge,” the report concludes.  The apparent contradictions here are partly due to each report analysing different types of data. According to Bruno “Cinner et al was about spatial patterns in fish populations while we asked how coral and macroalgal cover are related to human population density.” Put simply, one was looking at fish, the other at coral cover.  Still, the question remains, is local management of the kind highlighted by Cinner et al having a real impact on the health of reef ecosystems? Says Bruno, “Although I doubt most coral bright spots are bright because of local management, I do agree that... we should throw all our conservation dollars at them to keep them that way as long as possible.” The problem is in how each of these reports is interpreted. Cinner et al imply that sustainable management means healthy reefs - even though they are harvested by local populations. A positive message for conservationists and the local programmes they support. Bruno’s point however seems to be that all of this is academic in the face of climate change, lulling us into a dangerous and altogether unjustifiable sense of security. If we fail to drastically reduce the volume of CO2 entering the atmosphere, coral reefs everywhere will bleach and die, however well they are being managed.  But while Bruno & Valdivia frame their argument very carefully, it is possible that unscrupulous policy makers could seize upon their study to justify continued exploitation of marine resources, claiming that it makes no difference to the bigger picture. Professor Avigdor Abelson of Tel Aviv University who works on restoration ecology such as building artificial reefs fears it “may lead to undesirable consequences of accelerated coral reef degradation.”   Both reports are right. The danger is that they will be misinterpreted. "

"Michael Grange (Letters, 19 August) recommends “not asking the frogs first” before building tidal barrages on the Severn. But we are already being spoken to by the sand eels, mosquitoes, birds, butterflies and even the humble Highland saxifrage (Climate change threatens UK’s mountain plant life, 18 August) if only we would listen. They are on the move already. The environmental effects of sea-level rise will dramatically alter the Severn estuary, and all its inhabitants, if we do little to deploy alternatives to fossil fuels now.

"Environmental groups have turned on the Obama administration over offshore oil and gas extraction, warning it puts whales and dolphins in peril and risks undermining the president’s commitment to putting the brakes on climate change. Barack Obama, who recently called global warming an “genuine existential threat”, has enjoyed largely solid support from green groups that have praised his leadership on the issue. But Obama’s environmentalist allies are increasingly frustrated over federally approved fossil fuel drilling, just as the US president attempts to put the finishing touches on his climate legacy.   On Wednesday, leases for oil and gas exploration across 23.8m acres of the Gulf of Mexico will be auctioned off to fossil fuel companies. A total of 218.94m acres, about double the size of California, will have been offered up for leases in federal waters by the end of next year, with further leasing planned by the government in a new five-year program that will extend this process. In response, protesters stormed the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s office in New Orleans on Tuesday, demanding the cancellation of the lease sales because of the link between climate change and the kind of flooding that has devastated large parts of Louisiana. Several protesters were arrested.  “While climate change affects everyone, communities of color and low-income communities continue to be hit hardest by the lasting impacts of climate disasters,” said Anne Rolfes, founding director of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade. “Thousands of oil spills, sinking lands and extreme weather creating turmoil for countless people. What more will convince the Obama administration to stop treating the Gulf like a sacrifice zone to fossil fuel interests?” Another green group, the Center for Biological Diversity, is also ramping up its opposition to offshore drilling, releasing a report that found that burning all of the fossil fuels in federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico would release a staggering 32.8bn tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The group claimed that expanding drilling in the gulf is contrary to America’s pledge to help keep global temperatures to 1.5C above pre-industrial times and risks unleashing more extreme weather, drought and sea level rise upon swathes of the US.  “We can’t address climate change while expanding drilling the gulf. This report shows that new oil and gas leasing in the gulf would be a carbon bomb that will deepen our climate crisis,” said Kristen Monsell, oceans attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. “President Obama needs to align his energy and climate policies before leaving office, starting in the gulf.” In March, activists disrupted a lease sale in New Orleans, chanting “shut it down” and brandishing banners in front of bidding companies. The action didn’t disrupt the process, however, with BOEM now overseeing around 4,400 active leases in the Gulf of Mexico. Conservationists are also fretting over the impact of oil and gas exploration in the Atlantic Ocean. While the federal government has ruled out any drilling off the eastern seaboard in the immediate future, seismic airgun blasting is still being pursued by companies in waters stretching from Delaware to Florida. Research from Duke University’s Marine Geospatial Ecology Lab has been released as animated maps by green group Oceana, showing that bottlenose dolphins, fin, humpback and sperm whales are all present in areas deemed suitable for the airgun testing. A number of leading marine scientists have warned that airgun testing, where air is fired at the seabed to determine if oil or gas deposits reside there, can be extremely harmful to the ability of whales and dolphins to communicate with each other or find food. The Obama administration has been pressured to end the practice. “These maps confirm what we’ve long feared, that dolphins and whales along the east coast are at risk from dangerous seismic airgun blasting for oil and gas,” said Claire Douglass, campaign director at Oceana.  “Hearing that whales and dolphins could be injured is one thing, but seeing the scale of the threat is another. President Obama should stop seismic airgun blasting and protect our coast.”  But fossil fuel companies have warned against any winding down of offshore drilling, claiming that it creates jobs and helps the US become less dependent on energy sources from other countries. “If we are going to continue to drive investment in America, create jobs, and provide affordable energy, we must look to the future,” said said Louis Finkel, executive vice president of the American Petroleum Institute, which supports a US “energy renaissance” by drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. This stance has been embraced by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has an “America first” energy policy that would drastically ramp up domestic coal, oil and gas production. His rival Hillary Clinton has promised a swift transition to clean energy sources but has come under fire from progressives for her ties to the oil and gas industry and for leaving the door open to fracking."
"Air conditioning was a luxury in Britain 40 years ago, but the long hot summer of 1976 changed that. The scorching heat that summer lasted two months and most people sweated it out indoors with only open windows and electric fans for ventilation. After that, air conditioning no longer seemed so extravagant and its popularity soared. Air conditioners consume huge amounts of energy, though, and that’s adding to climate change. The US uses as much electricity to keep buildings cool as the whole of Africa uses for all its electrical needs. That power largely comes from polluting power stations, adding to the warmer climate.   And air-conditioning in vehicles burns more fuel, making even more greenhouse gases. With the demand for air conditioning rising worldwide, it’s reckoned that in around 30 years’ time more energy could be used for cooling than for heating. Air conditioning also pumps out heat straight into the atmosphere. Like a fridge, it takes heat from the inside of a building or car, then transfers it to the warm outside. That extra heat makes cities hotter, raising night-time temperatures by up to 2C, which then encourages people to turn up their air conditioning even higher. And there’s another sting to keeping cool. Air conditioning systems also use powerful greenhouse gases called hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), thousands of times more potent than carbon dioxide. These gases leak out into the atmosphere, especially from vehicles, and global emissions of HFCs rose by more than half between 2007 and 2012, adding to the burden of climate change even more.  And as the climate grows hotter, there’s more need to stay cool. It’s a vicious circle. "
"The deep waters off the coast of California could become home to the country’s largest offshore wind energy project and a test case for a technology that is still in its infancy. The 765-megawatt project, proposed by Seattle-based Trident Winds, would sit about 25 miles off California’s central coast, near the town of Cambria. If built, it will be larger than the 630-megawatt London Array off the coast of Kent, – the world’s largest working offshore wind farm that began operating in 2013.  The Trident project, which could power more than 200,000 homes, reflects an interest by the US to embrace offshore wind energy as part of a broader strategy to develop low-carbon electricity sources. The country has no offshore wind farms, though a number of projects are in the research phase to determine their profitability. The very first project to come online in the US is under construction off the coast of Rhode Island: the 30-megawatt Block Island wind farm that is expected to begin operating later this year. Offshore wind development already has taken off in Europe and other parts of the world. The UK, for example, has installed more than 5 gigawatts of offshore wind power plants, meeting 10% of its total energy demand. “It’s just another very valuable resource that not only will be benefiting energy generation, but will create a new industry in the state of California,” says Alla Weinstein, CEO of Trident Winds. Trident is proposing an unprecedented project in a state that has frowned on coastal energy development ever since a 1969 blowout at an offshore oil drilling platform near Santa Barbara, which released more than 3m gallons of crude oil into the waters. The resulting images of soiled beaches and oily seabirds were splashed around the world and helped launch the modern environmental movement. Recent attempts to build machines to harness the power of ocean currents off the state’s coast also drowned in failure as they ran into technical and financial problems and protests from local communities. California has some of the world’s toughest coastal development regulations. The state’s first large seawater desalination project, for example, took more than six years to win government approval and survived 14 lawsuits before construction started. “On the one hand, we want to support, in some fashion, renewable energy,” says Sara Aminzadeh, executive director of the environmental group California Coastkeeper Alliance. “On the other hand, we wouldn’t want to support anything that has serious impacts on marine issues. There is so much that is unknown about constructing something like that essentially in the middle of the ocean. So it could be a tough issue for us.” Trident submitted an application to the US Bureau of Ocean Energy Management in January to lease about 50 square miles of ocean for 30 years. The project will also need approval from several state agencies. “Not a lot of people have heard about offshore wind potential in California,” said Doug Boren, Pacific region supervisor in the Office of Strategic Resources at the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, the federal agency with jurisdiction over the project. “So we are moving fast and furious for getting California up to speed on things.” Nearly all of the offshore wind projects in the world installed wind turbines on platforms attached to ocean floor by concrete or steel pillars built into the seabed, in waters no more than 200 feet deep. The promise of stronger and more consistent winds farther offshore, however, requires a different technology for deep water. Within 50 nautical miles of the US coasts, more than 60% of the best wind energy sources – measured in wind speed, duration and timing – are in water that is too deep to build foundations drilled into the seabed, according to the US Department of Energy. The Trident project calls for mounting 100 turbines on floating foundations in water that’s roughly half a mile deep. Floating foundations, which are kept in place with anchors and cables, have so far been used only in small pilot projects in places such as Portugal, Norway and Scotland. The anchors themselves may be giant concrete blocks or huge steel structures with hooks that grab the sea floor, not unlike a ship’s anchor. The Norwegian firm Statoil claims to be the first with a commercial-scale floating wind project, which it expects to begin operating later this year off the coast of Scotland. Floating foundation design poses multiple technical challenges. The structure has to be able to withstand the harsh environment of the choppy ocean and high winds while supporting the weight of the turbines, which can be damaged by the pitching and bouncing motions at sea. Floating foundations tend to be more expensive because their anchoring systems actually require more steel than a fixed platform. Bringing power to shore also requires longer power cables, which add to the cost. Some costs could be lower for floating turbines, however. Installation can be cheaper and easier since the turbines and their floating platforms are constructed onshore, then simply towed to sea and anchored. Fixed turbine projects, on the other hand, must rent time aboard expensive, specialized industrial ships – first to install the foundations, then to assemble the turbines on top of them. Currently, floating wind energy is much more expensive than fixed offshore wind energy, says Tom Harries, an analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance. That’s likely to remain so for some time because fixed offshore installations are dropping dramatically in cost while floating projects are still emerging from tests, he adds. By 2020, floating wind projects will likely cost an estimated $9m per megawatt, compared with $4m per megawatt for fixed-foundation projects, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. “Conventional offshore wind is on this race to the bottom in price, which is kind of bad news for floating wind,” Harries says. Raising funds to finance projects with a novel technology will therefore be a significant hurdle for Trident. The company could line up investors more easily if it could secure a power purchase agreement from a California utility. The agreement typically commits the utility to buy the electricity from the project for 20 to 25 years, making it a guaranteed source of income for investors. Trident has yet to find a buyer for its energy. The few floating wind projects in the US are struggling to sell contracts for their electricity. A 30-megawatt project in Oregon called WindFloat Pacific, for example, received a $4m Department of Energy grant to assist with planning and design, only to find it couldn’t lure a buyer for its expensive electricity. Weinstein, who declines to disclose any cost estimate for the project, says she is undeterred by all these challenges and has been called “brave” for choosing California to pioneer a new field of renewable energy. She intends to start construction as early as 2021 and bring the project online in 2025. She believes the timing for developing the project is right. Last October, California’s governor Jerry Brown signed a new law requiring half of the state’s electricity to come from renewable resources by 2030. This means the state, which has been a friendly place to develop solar and land-based wind farms, must double its current level of renewable generation in just 15 years. To win government approval, Trident will have to prepare a lengthy report to investigate the potential environmental impact of its project. California’s coast is a major migration route for several whale species, and the underwater structures of the floating wind turbines could pose an entanglement risk. “All the marine mammals, they have pretty good sonar detection,” Weinstein says. “So because we’re talking about fairly thick lines, they can detect those obstacles in the water and swim around them. There have been no known incidents of marine mammals tangled up in mooring lines of offshore oil drilling platforms.” She also says the turbines will not produce any noise or vibration that might be bothersome to marine life. But whale scientist John Calambokidis questions her claim. He notes the proposed project site is near the Santa Lucia Bank, an area “very heavily used” by blue, fin, sperm and humpback whales. Federal law has designated each of them as endangered species. “Unfortunately, what we’ve seen historically and most dramatically in the last few years is that even simple lines can form an entanglement risk,” says Calambokidis, co-founder and research biologist at Cascadia Research in Olympia, Washington. “I think you have a vulnerability that comes from not recognizing it as a threat,” he says. “We frequently see humpback whales interacting and playing with kelp, which is almost like a rope structure. It will be draped over their backs, looped in their tails. They will roll around in it.” Another concern, as with all wind energy projects, is the potential for birds to be killed by the whirring blades. A British study found that many birds actively avoid offshore wind turbines, but its authors cautioned that many unknowns remain. “It’s the first of its kind, so it will be important to think about whether we need additional (regulatory) procedures to consider its effect on our oceans,” says Aminzadeh, of Coastkeeper Alliance. “In general, we want to think about whether this is the right place for this project. A lot of times, the factors that lead a private company like Trident to a location such as this are not [to do with] whether it’s the best place from an environmental perspective.”"
"The Liberal chairman of the Coalition’s environment policy committee, Craig Kelly, has questioned solar and wind power subsidies and would like a cost-benefit analysis of future emission reductions policy, due to be reviewed next year. Kelly was named chairman of the environment and energy committee at the party room meeting on Monday, making him responsible for coordinating backbench feedback to the government on climate and energy policy.  He said he was proud to be a climate sceptic rather than “wallow in groupthink, to be a sheep, or a lemming”. Kelly described himself as in the “Bjorn Lomborg” camp, suggesting wind and solar funding should be channelled into “further research” because those current renewables like wind and solar power had “diminishing returns”. Kelly said such changing the funding directions could create less emissions reductions in the short term but would have greater gains in the longer term. “I’m in Bjorn Lomborg camp, you have to put resources into a technological breakthroughs because [wind and solar] is on periphery and having so little effect,” Kelly said. His comments came on the day the governor general outlined the Turnbull government’s three-year strategy when opening the parliament. In the speech written by the prime minister’s office, Cosgrove lauded the Solar Communities program, which provides funding to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Kelly took to his Facebook page to quote Adam Smith in The Wealth of Nations, saying “the interest of [subsidy receivers] is always in some respects different from, and even opposite to, that of the public”. “I want to keep the debate going to see what is the best policy and what the costs are,” he told Guardian Australia. “There should be a cost-benefit analysis on these policies because one thing that greatly concerns me is the amount of people having their electricity cut off, because they can’t afford the bills.” Kelly said while he accepted that there had been temperature changes that had occurred since the mid 1700s and 1800s, there was no consensus around its causes. “The question is how much is CO2 induced and how much is natural?” Kelly said. “There is no consensus on that science, that warming is 100% result of CO2 but I accept part of it is CO2 induced.” Kelly said on energy policy it was important for people to accept the importance of low-cost energy – given the more people had to spend on electricity, the less they had to spend on the economy. “If we let prices creep up, we are going price ourselves out of the market,” he said. “By subsidising the cost of solar, that puts upward pressure on electricity prices and by setting targets for certain emissions, that puts upward pressure on prices.” Kelly said in considering the price of power, the option of nuclear power should be considered, though “the case has not been made out for nuclear power in Australia and I doubt that it actually will”. Kelly has previously argued the British officer Watkin Tench’s statements about Sydney summers in 1790-91 showed heat was extreme hundreds of years ago. But on Tuesday he said his article was a bit “tongue in cheek” to show up people who suggest one hot day was proof of global warming. “Read the history, read how careful these guys were with measurements and how things were happening, there is anecdotal evidence of mass deaths of bats and birds,” Kelly said.  He said while the rate of warming in the past 20 years had not been in line with predictions by the Intergovernment Panel on Climate Change predictions, he did not think the planet was cooling – in the past 150 years. “No I don’t accept the argument that the planet is cooling, it has been warming for 150 years but it depends on how far you go back in time,” he said."
"A 12-year-old boy in the far north of Russia has died in an outbreak of anthrax that experts believe was triggered when unusually warm weather caused the release of the bacteria. The boy was one of 72 nomadic herders, including 41 children, hospitalised in the town of Salekhard in the Arctic Circle, after reindeer began dying en masse from anthrax.  Five adults and two other children have been diagnosed with the disease, which is known as “Siberian plague” in Russian and was last seen in the region in 1941. More than 2,300 reindeer have died, and at least 63 people have been evacuated from a quarantine area around the site of the outbreak. “We literally fought for the life of each person, but the infection showed its cunning,”the Yamal governor, Dmitry Kobylkin, told the Interfax news agency. “It returned after 75 years and took the life of a child.” The tabloid LifeNews reported that the boy’s grandmother died of anthrax at a nomad camp last week. Authorities said the outbreak was linked to climate change. For the past month, the region has been experiencing abnormally high temperatures that have reached 95F.  Anthrax spores can survive in frozen human and animal remains for hundreds of years, waiting to be released by a thaw, according to Alexei Kokorin, head of WWF Russia’s climate and energy programme. “Such anomalous heat is rare for Yamal, and that’s probably a manifestation of climate change,” he said. Average temperatures in Russia have increased by 0.43C in the past 10 years, but the rise has been more pronounced in areas of the far north. The warmer climate has begun thawing the permafrost soil that covers much of Russia, including cemeteries and animal burial grounds. Thawing permafrost has also led to greater erosion of river banks where nomads often buried their dead, Kokorin said. “They didn’t bury deep because it’s hard to dig deep in permafrost,” he explained. According to custom, the Nenets tribe often inters its dead in a wooden coffin on open ground. The disease from thawing human and animal remains can get into groundwater that people then drink. The boy in Salekhard died from the intestinal form of the disease, which typically results in fever, stomach pain, diarrhea and vomiting. Other reports said a local cemetery was suspected, or infected venison. Three unusual sinkholes were discovered on the Yamal peninsula in 2014, a phenomenon that many scientists also tied to climate change. Thawing permafrost could have allowed gas in the ground to explode, they said. This summer, researchers have filmed grassy ground on an island off the Yamal peninsula that appeared to bounce under their feet. The phenomenon was likely caused by “bubbles” of methane and carbon dioxide, they said."

"First seabirds started falling out of the sky, washing up on beaches from California to Canada. Then emaciated and dehydrated sea lion pups began showing up, stranded and on the brink of death. A surge in dead whales was reported in the same region, and that was followed by the largest toxic algal bloom in history seen along the Californian coast. Mixed among all that there were population booms of several marine species that normally aren’t seen surging in the same year.  Plague, famine, pestilence and death was sweeping the northern Pacific Ocean between 2014 and 2015. This chaos was caused by a single massive heatwave, unlike anything ever seen before. But it was not the sort of heatwave we are used to thinking about, where the air gets thick with warmth. This occurred in the ocean, where the effects are normally hidden from view. Nicknamed “the blob”, it was arguably the biggest marine heatwave ever seen. It may have been the worst but wide-scale disruption from marine heatwaves is increasingly being seen all around the globe, with regions such as Australia seemingly being hit with more than their fair share. It might seem strange given their huge impact but the concept of a marine heatwave is new to science. The term was only coined in 2011. Since then a growing body of work documenting their cause and impact has developed. According to Emanuele Di Lorenzo from the Georgia Institute of Technology, that emerging field of study could not only reveal a hitherto underestimated source of climate-related chaos, it could change our very understanding of the climate. On the other side of the Pacific from “the blob”, Australia has been buffeted by a string of extreme marine heatwaves. This year at least three parts of the coast have been devastated by extreme water temperatures. Australia, it seems, could be smack in the middle of this global chaos. According to work published in 2014, both the south-east and south-west coasts are among the world’s fastest warming ocean waters. “They have been identified as global warming hotspots,” says Eric Oliver, an oceanographer at the University of Tasmania. “The seas there are warming fast and so we might expect there to be an increased likelihood or increased intensity of the events that happen there.  “Certainly attention is being focused on ocean changes on the south-east and south-west of Australia.”   It was in the study of a marine heatwave in south-west Australia that the term was coined just five years ago. In a report that still used the term “marine heatwave” in scare quotes, scientists from the West Australian department of fisheries found the heatwave off the state’s coast was “a major temperature anomaly superimposed on the underlying long-term ocean-warming trend”. That year, the researchers found, Western Australia had an unprecedented surge of hot water along its coast. Surface temperatures were up to 5C higher than the usual seasonal temperature. The pool of warm water stretched more than 1,500km from Ningaloo to the southern tip of the continent at Cape Leeuwin, and it extended more than 200km offshore. Unlike a terrestrial heatwave that will normally last a couple of weeks at most, this persisted for more than 10 weeks.  But five years later the full impact of that marine heatwave have are beginning to be more fully understood. Thomas Wernberg, an ecologist from the University of Western Australia, examined the impact on the gigantic kelp forests that line the western and southern coast of Australia, publishing his results in the prestigious journal Science. “It got so hot that the kelp forests died,” Wernberg says. For hundreds of kilometres, magnificent kelp forests that line the coast and support one of the world’s most biodiverse marine environments simply died in the heat But it wasn’t just their death that was the problem. While heatwaves on land can kill and destroy large sections of terrestrial forests – usually by allowing fires to spread – those trees normally grow back. What was disturbing about this marine heatwave was that many of the vast underwater forests never came back. The warming climate created changes that meant the kelp didn’t recover. About 100km of kelp forests just disappeared, probably forever. “At the same time, there was a range extension of tropical and subtropical fish that love eating seaweed. So that basically means that, even when the temperatures came down, the kelp couldn’t recover – there was a range extension of the herbivorous fishes that were eating the kelp.” In the place of the kelp forest, Wernberg found coral was starting to emerge. It was as if the heatwave in 2011 bulldozed the area, making way for a shift in the ecosystem that climate change was already trying to impose. “It is probably too early to say if this will eventually lead to new coral reefs,” Wernberg says. “However, this is how I imagine the process would start.” Wernberg estimated those kelp forests were directly responsible for sustaining rock lobster and abalone fisheries, as well as a tourist industry, together worth $10bn. If they were lost, it would be a serious problem for Australia, not to mention for the animals that rely on them. Wernberg says the kelp forests in Western Australia were likely to keep contracting. “I think the next big heatwave is just going to push what we see in the north ultimately further down and then it just depends on how bad that heatwave is, whether we go all the way down to Perth or whether we just go another 10km,” he told the Guardian when the study first came out. In 2015 Wernberg established a working group of biologists, oceanographers and climate scientists in Australia to examine marine heatwaves. He saw it as an exciting new field of study. That was timely, as less than a year later Australia would find itself virtually surrounded by pools of warm water that caused widespread and unprecedented destruction. They were spurred on by a large El Niño, which spreads warm water across the middle of the Pacific Ocean. But El Niños had been seen before and these marine heatwaves appeared to be unprecedented. Perhaps most dramatically, 2016 saw the Great Barrier Reef blasted by a marine heatwave that killed 22% of the coral there in one fell swoop. In the pristine northern sections, about half the coral is thought to have died.  The hotter water that bathed the reef has now subsided but the full damage is still being tallied. The immediate death of the coral is one thing but the after effects are starting to be seen, with a decline in fish numbers being reported. And, unusually, there is continued bleaching in parts of the reef, even now as the southern hemisphere moves past the middle of winter.  Justin Marshall, of the University of Queensland, has been studying the reef ecosystem around Lizard Island in the remote northern part of the Great Barrier Reef and warns that there appears to be “complete ecosystem collapse” there. He doesn’t have the final numbers from the surveys he is conducting but he says there are easily half as many fish there after the bleaching as there were before, and there are some species that were common before that are completely missing now. Marshall says that could be the beginning of a “regime shift” there – where the once magnificent and resilient coral is replaced permanently by a bed of seaweed. But as if disappearing coral reefs and kelp forests aren’t enough for one country, a marine heatwave in Australia in 2016 was also responsible for an unprecedented mangrove die-off. On the other side of Cape York from the Great Barrier Reef, a related heatwave in the Gulf of Carpentaria spurred along what one expert studying said was the worst mangrove die-off seen anywhere in the world. After hearing reports of the mangrove die-off, Norm Duke, an expert in mangrove ecology from James Cook University, got a helicopter and flew over 700km of coastline, to see what was happening. He says he was shocked by what he saw. He calculated dead mangroves now covered a combined area of 7,000 hectares. That was the worst mangrove mass die-off seen anywhere in the world, he says. “We have seen smaller instances of this kind of moisture stress before but what is so unusual now is its extent, and that it occurred across the whole southern gulf in a single month.”  Duke is assessing the precise structure of the die-off to figure out what the exact drivers were. By examining exactly which mangroves died, and measuring how far they were from the high-tide line, Duke hopes to figure out how much of the die-off is attributable to hot water and air, and how much to the dry weather. But, for now, Duke thinks all are to blame. “This is all correlated, so it’s hard to separate,” Duke says. Greg Browning from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology says with all these changes in the water temperature and the rainfall, big changes in ecosystems would almost be expected. “In a nutshell, there have been significantly below-average rainfall totals in the last two wet seasons ... and very warm sea surface temperatures,” he told the Guardian in July. “When you have those departures from average conditions, it’s bound to affect the ecosystem in some way.” Just like the kelp forests and the coral reef, there is a distinct possibility some of these mangroves will be lost forever. Duke says if the disruption is severe enough, the mangrove-dominated regions can become salt pans – flat, unvegetated regions covered in salt. And he says the most recent satellite images show the mangroves still haven’t recovered their leaves, suggesting they really are dead. And last, but not least, Tasmania has been virtually poached this year. Tasmania was bathed in an unprecedented pool of warm water that was 4.5C higher than average, devastating lucrative oyster farms, causing a drop in salmon catches and killing swathes of abalone.  With two of the world’s global warming hot spots sitting just off the coasts of Australia, the country is likely to continue seeing these marine heatwaves bring chaos and destruction. But the big question facing researchers is if they are increasing in frequency or severity or both, as a result of global warming. Wernberg says it’s the apparent increase in the effects of marine heatwaves that has driven him and others to study them in more detail than ever before.  “It’s not that they’ve been understudied in the past,” he says. “It’s that they didn’t occur to the extent they are now. “It seems like there are more and more extreme impacts attributed to them.”  Wernberg says it’s difficult to say “because you have one, then you have another one and then eventually you realise you are having more than you used to”. Di Lorenzo, an oceanographer at Georgia Institute of Technology in the US, conducted a major study of “the blob”, which, at least by some measures, was the worst marine heatwave ever seen. He says his study suggested it was made about 16% more likely as a result of climate change – but he warns that while he’s confident that the results show it was made significantly more likely by climate change, he’s not very confident with the precise figure. “I would feel comfortable with the sign of the effect, not necessarily with number.” But generally, Di Lorenzo says, looking at what is happening, he thinks climate change is increasing both the frequency and severity of marine heatwaves. So much so, he wonders if climate models are wrong, and underestimating the fluctuations in temperature that will occur as the globe warms. “The real system – if you look at the observations, and this is a paper I will publish very soon – the increase in variance is much much stronger than what models are predicting,” he says. “Maybe our models are too conservative.” Di Lorenzo says this sort of “variance” – including things like heatwaves – will always be stronger in the ocean, because the ocean has a kind of “memory” that means events build on top of each other, multiplying their effects. That memory is a result of temperature changing much more slowly in the ocean, as well as the ocean being able to absorb more heat in general. Oliver, from the University of Tasmania, would not discuss the results because they were under review at a journal but data he presented at a conference, he and colleagues including Wernberg, found “more, longer, and more intense” marine heatwaves over the past century. The results have not yet undergone peer-review but they found the same trend in many parts of the world. Since 1920, they found some regions were seeing an increase in frequency of about one extra marine heatwave every 20 years. But the plots show most of that increase happened in the past 30 years. They also found they’re becoming hotter, increasing by almost 0.4C per decade in some regions. And they’re lasting longer – an extra 0.4 days per decade. Putting it all together, the results globally were even more significant. Around the world, marine heatwaves were increasing by two days every decade since 1900. Over that time, he found the frequency and duration had doubled. As a result, the number of days in which there was a marine heatwave somewhere in the world had increased four-fold. “On average, there are 20 more [marine heatwave] days per year in the early 21st century than in the early 20th century,” the presentation concluded. Oliver and Wernberg declined to comment on the results, since some scientific journals refuse to publish results if the authors have already discussed them with the media.  But Di Lorenzo, who wasn’t involved in Oliver’s study, said the increasing frequency of these events is well outside of what anyone predicted, and he’s excited to see how it turns out. “I personally, as a scientist, I’m curious to see what happens. I hope to live long enough – maybe 20 or 30 years – to see what this experiment is going to turn into.” He said the situation is very grave for humanity but exciting for scientists. He compared the situation to a surgeon being faced with a sick patient. “If he has a very complicated surgery, of course he cares for the patient, but on the other hand he is very excited about trying a new surgery and potentially solving it.”"
"In 1971, then US Secretary of Agriculture Earl Butz uttered these unsympathetic words: “Before we go back to organic agriculture in this country, somebody must decide which 50 million Americans we are going to let starve or go hungry.” Since then, critics have continued to argue that organic agriculture is inefficient, requiring more land than conventional agriculture to yield the same amount of food. Proponents have countered that increasing research could reduce the yield gap, and organic agriculture generates environmental, health and socioeconomic benefits that can’t be found with conventional farming.  Organic agriculture occupies only 1% of global agricultural land, making it a relatively untapped resource for one of the greatest challenges facing humanity: producing enough food for a population that could reach 10 billion by 2050, without the extensive deforestation and harm to the wider environment. That’s the conclusion my doctoral student Jonathan Wachter and I reached in reviewing 40 years of science and hundreds of scientific studies comparing the long term prospects of organic and conventional farming. The study, Organic Agriculture in the 21st Century, published in Nature Plants, is the first to compare organic and conventional agriculture across the four main metrics of sustainability identified by the US National Academy of Sciences: be productive, economically profitable, environmentally sound and socially just. Like a chair, for a farm to be sustainable, it needs to be stable, with all four legs being managed so they are in balance. We found that although organic farming systems produce yields that average 10-20% less than conventional agriculture, they are more profitable and environmentally friendly. Historically, conventional agriculture has focused on increasing yields at the expense of the other three sustainability metrics. In addition, organic farming delivers equally or more nutritious foods that contain less or no pesticide residues, and provide greater social benefits than their conventional counterparts. With organic agriculture, environmental costs tend to be lower and the benefits greater. Biodiversity loss, environmental degradation and severe impacts on ecosystem services – which refer to nature’s support of wildlife habitat, crop pollination, soil health and other benefits – have not only accompanied conventional farming systems, but have often extended well beyond the boundaries of their fields, such as fertilizer runoff into rivers. Overall, organic farms tend to have better soil quality and reduce soil erosion compared to their conventional counterparts. Organic agriculture generally creates less soil and water pollution and lower greenhouse gas emissions, and is more energy efficient. Organic agriculture is also associated with greater biodiversity of plants, animals, insects and microbes as well as genetic diversity. Despite lower yields, organic agriculture is more profitable (by 22–35%) for farmers because consumers are willing to pay more. These higher prices essentially compensate farmers for preserving the quality of their land. Studies that evaluate social equity and quality of life for farm communities are few. Still, organic farming has been shown to create more jobs and reduce farm workers’ exposure to pesticides and other chemicals. Organic farming can help to both feed the world and preserve wildland. In a study published this year, researchers modeled 500 food production scenarios to see if we can feed an estimated world population of 9.6 billion people in 2050 without expanding the area of farmland we already use. They found that enough food could be produced with lower-yielding organic farming, if people become vegetarians or eat a more plant-based diet with lower meat consumption. The existing farmland can feed that many people if they are all vegan, a 94% success rate if they are vegetarian, 39% with a completely organic diet, and 15% with the Western-style diet based on meat. Realistically, we can’t expect everyone to forgo meat. Organic isn’t the only sustainable option to conventional farming either. Other viable types of farming exist, such as integrated farming where you blend organic with conventional practices or grass-fed livestock systems. More than 40 years after Earl Butz’s comment, we are in a new era of agriculture.During this period, the number of organic farms, the extent of organically farmed land, the amount of research funding devoted to organic farming and the market size for organic foods have steadily increased. Sales of organic foods and beverages are rapidly growing in the world, increasing almost fivefold between 1999 and 2013 to $72bn. This 2013 figure is projected to double by 2018. Closer to home, organic food and beverage sales in 2015 represented almost 5% of US food and beverage sales, up from 0.8% in 1997. Scaling up organic agriculture with appropriate public policies and private investment is an important step for global food and ecosystem security. The challenge facing policymakers is to develop government policies that support conventional farmers converting to organic systems. For the private business sector, investing in organics offers a lot of entrepreneurial opportunities and is an area of budding growth that will likely continue for years to come. In a time of increasing population growth, climate change and environmental degradation, we need agricultural systems that come with a more balanced portfolio of sustainability benefits. Organic farming is one of the healthiest and strongest sectors in agriculture today and will continue to grow and play a larger part in feeding the world. It produces adequate yields and better unites human health, environment and socioeconomic objectives than conventional farming.

"The split in the Climate Change Authority is a rerun of the climate policy fight Australia has been having for the past 10 years – the clash between what is undeniably necessary and what is politically possible. The CCA report, to be released on Wednesday, lands exactly on the spot where the major parties might, just might, be able to reach a compromise and finally end the barren years of climate policy “war”, policy reversal and time-wasting gridlock.  Guardian Australia understands the report recommends a type of emissions trading scheme for the electricity sector where generators are penalised for polluting above an emissions-intensity baseline.  It’s the policy Labor took to the last election and exactly what most observers assumed the Coalition’s Direct Action would morph into after next year’s review shows what everyone already knows, that it isn’t fit for purpose in its current form.  The CCA is also understood to recommend a strengthening of the current “safeguards mechanism” for other big polluters. The dissenters argue the authority is supposed to make recommendations based on what is scientifically necessary and leave it up to the politicians to make the political compromises – and that the recommended policy cannot meet the increasingly ambitious greenhouse gas reductions that Australia agreed to in Paris last year. They are probably right. But over the past decade the undeniably necessary task of doing our part to avert global warming has become ever-bigger and the politically-possible solutions seem to have shrivelled. We’ve actually done very little. The new energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, started out in his new job saying Direct Action needed no change at all because it was “very successful”. An authority report pushing for change – backed by board members mostly appointed by the Coalition – could help make the case that that starting point was never tenable. The last time a politically possible policy was defeated because it wouldn’t achieve the scientifically-necessary greenhouse gas cuts was when the parliament voted down Kevin Rudd’s emissions trading scheme. And that started the long and sorry story that led us here."

"These days we don’t just talk about the weather; we tweet about it too. Recently British Gas analysed a quarter of a million UK weather tweets, and the results suggest that people’s feelings about the weather might depend on where they live. Despite being blessed with more than average amounts of sunshine, people living in Surrey and Hampshire have a tendency to moan, with nearly half of their weather-related tweets being negative. Meanwhile, in Essex – one of Britain’s driest counties – residents take to Twitter at the first sign of rain, with nearly one third of their weather tweets mentioning rain.   Yorkshire folk are generally cheery about their weather, with more than two-thirds of the county’s weather-related tweets being of a positive nature. Curiously, people in some of the snowiest parts of the country are the most stoic when it comes to snow. Residents of Roxburghshire in the Scottish Borders mention snow in 6% of their tweets. The national average is 11%. The variation in types of weather tweets is probably largely explained by climatic differences between counties. “Given the way the human brain is wired we respond more strongly to negative and novel events,” says Vinita Mehta, a clinical psychologist in Washington DC. So, for example, a drop of rain is considered unusual and worth talking about in Essex, but normal in Cumbria. However, tweets may not be all that representative of British feelings about the weather. “Demography might be playing a role, with younger folks more likely to broadcast their sentiments on Twitter,” says Mehta. Nonetheless, it can be fun to speculate exactly where the weather whingers live.  "
"The planet is warming at a pace not experienced within the past 1,000 years, at least, making it “very unlikely” that the world will stay within a crucial temperature limit agreed by nations just last year, according to Nasa’s top climate scientist. This year has already seen scorching heat around the world, with the average global temperature peaking at 1.38C above levels experienced in the 19th century, perilously close to the 1.5C limit agreed in the landmark Paris climate accord. July was the warmest month since modern record keeping began in 1880, with each month since October 2015 setting a new high mark for heat. But Nasa said that records of temperature that go back far further, taken via analysis of ice cores and sediments, suggest that the warming of recent decades is out of step with any period over the past millennium. “In the last 30 years we’ve really moved into exceptional territory,” Gavin Schmidt, director of Nasa’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said. “It’s unprecedented in 1,000 years. There’s no period that has the trend seen in the 20th century in terms of the inclination (of temperatures).” “Maintaining temperatures below the 1.5C guardrail requires significant and very rapid cuts in carbon dioxide emissions or co-ordinated geo-engineering. That is very unlikely. We are not even yet making emissions cuts commensurate with keeping warming below 2C.” Schmidt repeated his previous prediction that there is a 99% chance that 2016 will be the warmest year on record, with around 20% of the heat attributed to a strong El Niño climatic event. Last year is currently the warmest year on record, itself beating a landmark set in 2014. “It’s the long-term trend we have to worry about though and there’s no evidence it’s going away and lots of reasons to think it’s here to stay,” Schmidt said. “There’s no pause or hiatus in temperature increase. People who think this is over are viewing the world through rose-tinted spectacles. This is a chronic problem for society for the next 100 years.” Schmidt is the highest-profile scientist to effectively write-off the 1.5C target, which was adopted at December’s UN summit after heavy lobbying from island nations that risk being inundated by rising seas if temperatures exceed this level. Recent research found that just five more years of carbon dioxide emissions at current levels will virtually wipe out any chance of restraining temperatures to a 1.5C increase and avoid runaway climate change. Temperature reconstructions by Nasa, using work from its sister agency the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, found that the global temperature typically rose by between 4-7C over a period of 5,000 years as the world moved out of ice ages. The temperature rise clocked up over the past century is around 10 times faster than this previous rate of warming. The increasing pace of warming means that the world will heat up at a rate “at least” 20 times faster than the historical average over the coming 100 years, according to Nasa. The comparison of recent temperatures to the paleoclimate isn’t exact, as it matches modern record-keeping to proxies taken from ancient layers of glacier ice, ocean sediments and rock. Scientists are able to gauge greenhouse gas levels stretching back more than 800,000 years but the certainty around the composition of previous climates is stronger within the past 1,000 years. While it’s still difficult to compare a single year to another prior to the 19th century, a Nasa reconstruction shows that the pace of temperature increase over recent decades outstrips anything that has occurred since the year 500. Lingering carbon dioxide already emitted from power generation, transport and agriculture is already likely to raise sea levels by around three feet by the end of the century, and potentially by 70 feet in the centuries to come. Increasing temperatures will shrink the polar ice caps, make large areas of the Middle East and North Africa unbearable to live in and accelerate what’s known as Earth’s “sixth mass extinction” of animal species."
"James Cameron has called Donald Trump a “madman” and criticised the Republican presidential candidate over his denial of climate change, according to the Associated Press. The Avatar director, speaking ahead of the premiere of his new documentary short, Not Reality TV, at the Democratic national convention, said that Trump’s assertion that he would tear up the Paris climate agreement and his repeated dismissal of the science behind climate change was “incredibly reckless and dangerous”.  Cameron’s film, introduced at the DNC by Sigourney Weaver, who provided the voiceover, details how US workers have been affected by droughts and adverse weather in recent years. “Crops are failing, food prices are rising, our children are at risk,” says Weaver, before a victim of Hurricane Sandy describes how she lost her daughter to the storm.  The film features well-known figures including Jack Black, Don Cheadle and the Pope, who is shown describing a planet teetering on the brink of “suicide”. Hillary Clinton makes a late cameo, but the starring role is saved for Trump himself, who is shown at various rallies ridiculing the idea of climate change. “We need some global warming,” he says at one point. “It’s freezing!”  In a statement, Cameron said: “We made this film to show the reality of climate change – how it’s directly affecting millions of people each day. As I’ve said before, to save our planet we need to mobilise like we did during the second world war – the threat to our country and children is that severe.” “As an American, I am also deeply concerned about my family’s future, about our shared future as a nation,” said Weaver in her introduction to the documentary. “That future is at risk.”"

"Having marked his first 100 days as London mayor, Sadiq Khan has chosen his 101st to announce the appointment of a deputy mayor for environment and energy. Shirley Rodrigues, who is currently acting executive director for climate change at the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF), a philanthropic organisation which operates in developing countries, has previously worked at City Hall on implementing London’s Low Emission Zone and programmes for retrofitting buildings. She is also former director of policy at the Sustainable Development Commission. She will immediately take the lead on finalising Khan’s proposals for tackling London’s poor air quality, for which a consultation has already been conducted. The consultation results are to be published in September, followed by two further, more detailed, stages addressing plans for an initial £10 a day emissions surcharge on polluting vehicles entering central London and the forthcoming Ultra Low Emission Zone as a whole.   This is a policy area the mayor will be wanting to show continuing rapid progress on, particularly as it will take longer and, in some cases, be more difficult to demonstrate that he’s delivering on some of his other high profile manifesto pledges. Rodrigues’s appointment has been welcomed by Friends of the Earth’s Sophie Neuberg, who says it is “a strong signal that our environment is on the agenda at City Hall”. Rodrigues will also be responsible for setting up a not-for-profit company to be called Energy for Londoners aimed at helping the city boost its recycling rates and produce more of its own, low carbon energy. During the election campaign, Khan paid an enthusiastic visit to the Bunhill Energy Centre in Islington, which diverts heat generated by the London Underground to heat homes. His manifesto says Energy for Londoners will provide: A comprehensive range of energy services to to help Londoners generate more low carbon energy and increase their energy efficiency, support local and community energy enterprises, and buy clean energy generated across the city, using it to power GLA and TfL facilities. Plenty for Rodrigues, Khan’s latest senior female appointee, to be getting on with, then. Here’s a clip of her talking about her work for CIFF with the C40 Cities climate change group. Sadiq Khan’s manifesto pledges for creating “a greener, cleaner London” are here. "
"MS Estraden looks, on first glance, like a normal cargo ship. Just another one of the 50,000 vessels transporting pretty much everything we buy, sell and consume. But on closer inspection, ship-spotting enthusiasts will notice two large cylinders rising from the deck. These are rotating devices that capture wind and help propel the ship forward. It is technology first trialled back in the 1920s, but only now brought into commercial use. For the past year and a half, the MS Estraden, which belongs to the Dutch-owned shipping company Bore, has been testing out the cylinders on its regular journey between Rotterdam and Teesport, on the north-east coast of the UK. The result: it has cut fuel costs by 6% (pdf). “It’s hard to generalise because unlike many other technologies, the savings are dependent on the route sailed (and the weather conditions specific to that route), but the savings on large tankers and bulk carriers could be greater than 10%,” says Tristan Smith, shipping and climate change expert at UCL. Smith has been following the MS Estraden and its wind cylinders trial with interest as he looks into ways shipping companies can cut their greenhouse gas emissions. It’s a thankless task at times, with shipping and climate change a largely mute topic among the media, politicians and NGOs. Shipping brings us 90% of everything we buy and consume, yet most of us remain blind to both its role in our lives and its contribution to global climate emissions: currently around 3%. The industry has no targets for reducing emissions; the climate talks in Paris last year were skilfully negotiated with warnings that a cap on emissions for shipping would be a cap on global trade and growth. On current projections, the sector could be contributing upwards of 6% (pdf) of global greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Although the UN agency that regulates shipping puts out glowing press releases, its only two policies so far are achieving little. There is an agreement for ships to record and report data on fuel consumption, but not until 2018 at the earliest, and rules to ensure new ships being built are more efficient. “Recent new ships have regularly been achieving design improvements not because of the regulation, but because of market forces including an oversupply of ships forcing greater competition and increased pressure for owners to seek margins through efficiency,” says Smith.  Shipping companies blame factors outside their control for their climate impact, in particular a tripling in demand for shipping over the past 40 years. However, as the MS Estraden shows, there are tangible options that shipping companies could pursue to reduce emissions if they wanted. Bore says it was “proud” to be the first company to demonstrate renewable energy-powered vessels and wanted to find ways to cut its environmental impact. “It’s [shipping] a conservative industry,” says Tuomas Riski, CEO of Norsepower, the Finnish company that developed the wind-powered cylinders used on MS Estraden. Although he does now have interest from other shipping companies in Europe and Asia, the original funding for his research came from venture-capitalists rather than the shipping sector. Another company pushing wind technology is the Germany-based SkySails. It has equipped five ships so far with automated kites to help propel them and cut fuel consumption. Despite average fuel savings of 2-3 tonnes a day, it has found it difficult to attract interest from ship companies. “Many ship owners struggle to survive and there’s not much money for investing in solutions improving long-term profitability – ‘We don’t even know if we’re still there in five years’ is what we hear,” says Henning Kuehl, head of business development at SkySails. “There’s also a structural problem slowing down the process: ship owners (who have to make the investment) often don’t pay for the fuel – that’s the charterer’s duty. The charterer on the other side doesn’t charter the ship for long enough a period to make low-carbon technologies pay back.”  With a wariness about renewables, low fuel prices and little political incentive, the onus is on numerous trials to convince shipping companies of the benefit. “The sector is risk-adverse so expanding uptake requires a high burden of proof,” says Conor Walsh, research associate on shipping at the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research. “Most of the technologies at the moment are low-scale and not mainstream. There are not yet many in commercial use. One fast-track solution could be for major users of cargo such as retailers and commodity companies to start insisting on the use of more efficient, low-carbon ships. This is starting to happen – Cargill, for example, says that where possible it refuses to charter the most polluting vessels – but doesn’t involve renewable technologies such as wind.  Maersk, one of the few shipping companies to set itself targets for reducing emissions, says cost savings rather than consumer demand remains the main driving force. “There is a limit to how far we can go alone,” says John Kornerup Bang, Maersk’s lead adviser on climate change. “We need fair regulation and limits for the industry, otherwise there is a gap between the free ride of those doing nothing and us.”  With no sign yet of any industry-wide emission reduction targets, Kuehl says the responsibility is on all of those involved in shipping to help the sector think long term. “The market is still quite opportunistic with charterers hopping from one vessel to the next, depending on which is the cheapest. To make a change, cargo owners, charterers and ship owners need to come to one table and work out long-term cooperations so that green shipping works for each party.” "
"Last week, the California state senate passed Assembly Joint Resolution 43, urging the federal government to pass a revenue-neutral carbon tax: WHEREAS, A national carbon tax would make the United States a leader in mitigating climate change and the advancing clean energy technologies of the 21st Century, and would incentivize other countries to enact similar carbon taxes, thereby reducing global carbon dioxide emissions without the need for complex international agreements; now, therefore, be it Resolved by the Assembly and the Senate of the State of California, jointly, That the Legislature hereby urges the United States Congress to enact, without delay, a tax on carbon-based fossil fuels; and be it further Resolved ... That all tax revenue should be returned to middle- and low-income Americans to protect them from the impact of rising prices due to the tax  Copies of the Resolution were sent to President Obama, Vice President Biden, House Speaker Ryan, Senate Majority Leader McConnell, and to all members of Congress representing California. The document specifically calls for the type of revenue-neutral carbon tax advocated by the grassroots organization Citizens’ Climate Lobby. Studies have shown that a rising carbon tax with all revenue returned to taxpayers would have a modestly beneficial impact on the economy, while cutting carbon pollution at faster rates than current policies. California has become the US leader in tackling global warming. 10 years ago, the state passed the Global Warming Solutions Act, requiring that its greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 be no higher than 1990 levels. California achieved that goal in 2010, 10 years early, and is among the lowest per-capita carbon polluting states.  On the same day last week, the state legislature also passed a bill expanding the Global Warming Solutions Act, requiring a 40% cut in California’s carbon pollution from 1990 levels by 2030. In other words, California isn’t just calling on the federal government to take action on climate change; the state is leading the way. It remains to be seen whether any climate legislation can survive in the current toxic partisan political climate of Washington DC. However, a revenue-neutral carbon tax has the best chance due to its bipartisan appeal. Its requirement that carbon polluters pay for the costs of their pollution appeals to the political left, while its free market, small government approach appeals to the political right.  By returning 100% of the taxed revenue to American households, the policy blunts the rising costs of energy produced by burning fossil fuels. In fact, studies project that a majority of Americans would receive a rebate larger than their increase in energy bills; only those who use the most fossil fuel energy would see costs rise more than the rebate. It’s a policy that’s hard to dislike. It makes polluters pay, goes a long way toward tackling the immense threat of human-caused global warming, results in cleaner air and water by reducing the burning of dirty fossil fuels, and has a modestly beneficial overall economic impact. However, many in the fossil fuel industry oppose the policy for obvious reasons, and through campaign donations they have a solid grip on the Republican Party. In fact, pressure from fossil fuel lobbyists convinced House Republicans to pass their own Resolution condemning a carbon tax less than three months ago. Thus it’s difficult to see California’s urging having much impact on Congress. Perhaps if the 2016 elections are a disaster for the Republican Party, they’ll change direction away from extreme partisanship and climate denial. Citizens’ Climate Lobby is optimistic that with enough grassroots lobbying, they can convince Congress to pass a revenue-neutral carbon tax in 2017. It may take more states following California’s lead in calling on Congress to address the climate threat. California is certainly influential - it has the world’s 6th-largest economy, on par with that of France. The state put a price on carbon pollution via a cap and trade system in 2012, and since then its economy has continued to grow while emissions have fallen.  It would certainly behoove Republican Party leaders to reverse their climate denial platform. This is an issue on which - as with civil rights and gay marriage - they’re on the wrong side of history, and the electorate is quickly moving in the opposite direction. Climate denial is predominant among old, white men, and even young conservatives want the government to take climate action to preserve their future. In 2012, the GOP published an ‘autopsy report’ that concluded young voters are “rolling their eyes at what the party represents.” Focus groups called them “scary,” “narrow minded,” and an “out of touch” party of “stuffy old men.” The report perfectly encapsulates the party’s stone-age stance on climate change. Of course, the report also concluded that “many minorities wrongly think that Republicans do not like them or want them in the country,” and the party proceeded to nominate Donald “ban all Muslims” and “build a wall” Trump for president.  In other words, the Republican Party correctly identified its problems in 2012, and has since proceeded to make those problems even worse. But it’s only a matter of time until they’re forced to shift away from the current extreme, including on climate denial, or risk permanently alienating a majority of American voters.  California’s Resolution is urging them to move in that direction. Don’t be surprised if more states follow suit and turn up the heat on GOP climate denial."
"The newly elected One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts has denied he is a “sovereign citizen” in response to revelations he wrote Julia Gillard a letter demanding to be exempted from the carbon tax. In a joint interview with his fellow crossbench senator David Leyonhjelm on the ABC’s Insiders program on Sunday, Roberts also accused the former environment minister Greg Hunt of introducing a carbon tax and reiterated his belief there was no empirical evidence carbon dioxide caused global warming.  When asked if he were a sovereign citizen, Roberts replied: “The Australian people and the Queensland people are more interested in things like the economy and security. But I’m not a sovereign man.” Sovereign citizens are a radical libertarian political movement spawned in the United States, the central tenet of which is to refuse to consent to laws and taxation. In a letter to Gillard in 2011, Roberts rejected that he was bound by carbon tax legislation. “I, Malcolm-Ieuan Roberts, the living soul am not living in a free and equal society or should pay for it in some further spurious tax levied supposedly on carbon dioxide, and believe that none exist,” it said. On Insiders, Roberts explained he had intended to point out some issues with the carbon tax but “didn’t do my research adequately so I stepped back into the conventional approach”. He explained he sent the letter because it appeared “the majority of the Liberal party and certainly almost all the National party ... said that they are opposed to the claims about carbon dioxide hurting our planet [but] none of them would do anything.  “So that was the last resort. I didn’t explore it deeply enough.” Roberts said he was “definitely not” seeking any longer to be treated differently to other Australians and agreed he would be “part of the system”. He said there was no empirical evidence showing the need to tax carbon dioxide. In reference to the safeguards mechanism in the Direct Action policy, Roberts said: “Greg Hunt has passed through the Senate last year a carbon dioxide tax that came into effect on 1 July.” The mechanism is supposed to ensure that increased emissions from heavy industry and electricity generators do not undo the reductions bought through the government’s $2.5bn scheme, by setting baselines for their emissions. Leyonhjelm, a Liberal Democrat senator, rejected the view there was no evidence for global warming and said his party “[stays] out of the scientific debate”. “Our view is the government shouldn’t do anything unless Brazil, Russia, India, China, US are all doing something, then little Australia should join in for trade reasons,” he said. “But, until that occurs, it’s pointless sending our industries, making our industries uncompetitive by high electricity prices when the rest of the world is not doing the same thing.” Both Roberts and Leyonhjelm pledged to revive the debate around section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act, which prohibits insulting or offensive speech based on race. Leyonhjelm predicted a new bill would propose removing the “insult or offend” portion of the law and promised to bring his own bill to remove section 18C entirely, which, if passed, would allow humiliation and intimidation through racist speech. “Free speech is free speech, there’s no qualification to it, you know, let’s just remove 18C entirely and everything that goes with it,” he said. Roberts said: “It’s very important to the country ... because at the moment a lot of people are afraid to speak up.” Asked about the impact on racial minorities, Roberts said: “The only person who decides whether I’m upset is me.” Leyonhjelm agreed, saying: “If you want to take offence, that’s your choice.  “You have the choice of feeling another feeling. Offence is always taken, not given. If you don’t want to be offended it’s up to you, don’t be offended. We’re not responsible for the feelings of other people. None of us are.” Roberts said the leader of One Nation, Pauline Hanson, had made clear the party’s four senators should put their constituents first and if he and Hanson disagreed with the West Australian senator Rod Culleton “we will vote accordingly”. He said Hanson was “the best person I’ve ever worked for” and confirmed he would vote with Hanson because they both represented Queensland. “We will be voting as a bloc but our ultimate responsibilities are to the people who are representing.”"
"Bright and glistening with all the glory of youth and promise, her eyes glance upwards. A jet crosses a cloudless sky. A field of wheat sways in the breeze. She opens her arms in a wide embrace, open to the horizon.  “This moment we’re in didn’t just happen,” muses the narrator as an uplifting orchestral score builds. “We didn’t just arrive here by luck.” The scenes in the new online commercial are cut fast.  Metronomic oil derricks pump at dusk. A dawn runner burns city streets. Sausages sizzle. Coffee bubbles. A ballet dancer stretches. A devoted new dad kisses a newborn’s head (there’s always a rent-a-baby).  Then, once we’re feeling all that collective love for humanity that we’re all known for, we finally get to the punchline. “Using oil and natural gas to build cities, connect populations and achieve a goal at the heart of the efforts of men and women. The ability to provide.” Yep. It’s a new advert for fossil fuels and it tugs on our hopes and aspiration with all the subtlety of a dog tearing at your trouser leg.  This slick effort comes from a just-launched “non-profit” group called Fueling US Forward, reportedly financially backed by the oil billionaire Koch brothers. So no conflict then. The group’s president, long-time fossil fuel industry figure Charlie Drevna, says he wants the group to remind people “out in the real world” how fundamental fossil fuel energy is to their lives.  Of course, not mentioned are the widespread global impacts of climate change from the increasing risks of bushfires to rising sea levels, extreme heat and the acidification of the oceans.  The Koch brothers have been pumping millions of dollars into organisations that spread doubt about the causes of climate change while fighting attempts to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. It’s true that since the start of the industrial revolution, the vast majority of the world’s energy has come from digging up and burning long dead plants and animals. While it was good for a while (forgetting the oil spills, polluted waterways, smog, acid rain and whatnot), scientists have been warning for decades that if we don’t break that nasty habit, then the impacts will be wide, expensive and, for some, unliveable. But the Fueling US Forward campaign is just the latest in a desperate bid for moral superiority from the fossil fuel industry. In 2015, the peak mining lobby group launched its “Little Black Rock” campaign to tell us about the “endless possibilities” of coal. But the campaign appeared to backfire. Polling suggested public support for coal dropped during a campaign that was mercilessly mocked.  In February 2014, major coal company Peabody Energy launched its “Advanced Energy for Life” campaign to convince the public and politicians that coal was the only way to bring poorer countries out of poverty. Australian politicians, from the current and former prime ministers down, have embraced the coal industry’s talking point.  But Peabody’s current financial state is analogous to its “energy poverty” argument and the wider plea from the fossil fuel industry to keep on burning. Bankrupt. According to figures from Bloomberg New Energy Finance and reported in the Financial Times, the world’s 20 biggest economies are shifting away from fossil fuels. In the last five years, the share of electricity coming from renewables has jumped 70 per cent.  It’s fine for the fossil fuel industry to remind us of all the great things coal, oil and gas helped the world to achieve.  But campaigns like Fueling U.S Forward, with all their stock images and cynical baby-kissing should be seen as the lament of a dying industry.  They’re an epitaph, not a life lesson."
"On the day the government moved to save 15 of 35 climate science positions planned to be cut at the CSIRO, the Senate election results in Queensland showed One Nation’s Malcolm Roberts had won a second seat for the party in that state. He stood in front of the media and denounced the government for taking part in an international climate change conspiracy and called for all policies that aim to reduce greenhouse gases to be abandoned.  This is the climate sceptic behind Pauline Hanson’s latest political journey. Roberts is the “project leader” of a group called the Galileo Movement. It launched in 2011, with the aim of exposing what its leaders described as the “political fabrication of global warming alarm”. He claimed in 2012 in an interview with Fairfax Media that climate science is controlled “by some of the major banking families in the world” who collude “in a tight-knit cabal with the United Nations”. Those comments were one step too far even for News Corp columnist Andrew Bolt, who himself has argued that climate change is all a big conspiracy. But now, elected to federal parliament, Roberts did not shy away from this statement. “I’ve done a lot of research into climate,” he said at a media conference on Thursday. “I went looking into the agencies that have been spreading the climate science. I started finding out things about the CSIRO and Bureau of Meteorology. That led me then to the UN, which has been driving this. Then I started following the money trails.” He went on to explain that they could be traced back to a few families who are making “trillions” of dollars. When One Nation announced its policies for this year’s election, an attack on climate science was strangely prominent. Alongside a “royal commission to determine if Islam is a religion or political ideology” the party has also called for “a royal commission (or similar) into the corruption of climate science”. “Climate change should not be about making money for a lot of people and giving scientists money,” the party’s website says. This renewed focus on climate change had the fingerprints of Malcolm Roberts all over it. Roberts says he is a scientist (he has a mining engineering degree) and that the CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology are no longer involved in science, since he says there is nothing to support the climate science they do. “All we need to do is stop these ridiculous lies based on climate,” he said. Whether Roberts will have any impact on the functioning of the new parliament is not yet clear. But he said he has been called by both Malcolm Turnbull and attorney general, George Brandis.  “They offered their congratulations and then said they would make sure they would get the resources to us so we could do our jobs,” he said."
"Only 20 climate science positions will be lost from the CSIRO, down from an initial 96, after the Turnbull government intervened, issuing a ministerial directive to the independent agency. Guardian Australia understands 35 climate scientist will still be sacked, but there will be 15 new hires. It is also understood there is no new money for the appointments, but must come from existing CSIRO funding.  The cuts were first announced by the CSIRO in February this year. The decision was made by the CSIRO, which acts independently from government, but were a result of cuts the government made to environmental research funding. Greg Hunt, who replaced Christopher Pyne as minister for science and innovation in July, said on Thursday there would be 15 new climate science jobs and $37m invested in climate science research over 10 years. First reported in Fairfax Media on Thursday, Hunt said he made the changes by issuing a ministerial directive to the CSIRO. When the CSIRO first decided to make the cuts, the plan was to cut about 100 climate scientists. After a public outcry, the numbers were quickly reduced to just 70, and by April the number had reduced to about 35 jobs. Speaking on ABC’s AM program, Hunt said the move indicated a new government with a new focus. “It’s a decision that the prime minister and myself have taken. It’s a new government and we’re laying out a direction that climate science matters,” he said. When the cuts were announced, then Labor opposition spokesmen for science and industry Kim Carr called on the government to intervene to reverse the cuts. At the time Pyne responded that the CSIRO was an independent agency, indicating it wasn’t appropriate for the government to intervene. Asked whether the this week’s ministerial directive to focus on climate science impinged on the CSIRO’s independence, CSIRO climate scientist John Church said on ABC RN that he had “mixed feelings about that”. “Yes CSIRO does need to be independent. They need to be able to make decisions about the long-term future needs of Australia, but that has to be a broad view of Australia’s needs.” Will Steffen from the Climate Council said he agreed the CSIRO needed to be independent, but this was an exceptional circumstance. “I think there are cases where some really drastically bad decisions are made, where government I think, on behalf of the public and the public good does have the authority and the right to intervene,” Steffen said. Steffen said how significant the decision was depended on the details about exactly which jobs would be saved. Church, a world-renowned sea-level rise researcher, said regardless of where the funding went, he would probably leave the organisation following what had been a very stressful time."
"BP has quietly announced the planned location of its controversial drilling in the Great Australian Bight, and the two sites fall within the Commonwealth Marine Reserve. Despite being the subject of a Senate inquiry, and having its application to drill knocked back twice by the regulator NOPSEMA, BP had so far never released the precise location of its exploratory drilling wells in the pristine Great Australian Bight.  In a document released by BP entitled “Update on regulatory approvals”, the company included a small map showing the location of the planned wells. The map doesn’t indicate the location of the marine reserves but, when overlaid with the reserve maps, the wells could be seen to fall within them. According to the Department of Environment, that particular area was inscribed in the reserve system for a range of reasons including being a “globally important seasonal calving habitat for the threatened southern right whale” and important foraging areas for sea lions, white sharks and sperm whales. The section of the marine park that BP wants to drill in is listed as a “multiple use zone”, which allows for mining, oil and gas activities. According to analysis by the Wilderness Society, 47% of BP’s exploration leases were outside the marine reserves. A spokeswoman for BP said they believed the oil industry could safely coexist with the marine environment. “We have assessed potential environmental issues from exploration activities in the Great Australian Bight and in turn incorporated this into our planning.” Peter Owen, the Australian director for the Wilderness Society, disagreed. “It’s outrageous that BP has only finally quietly revealed where it plans to drill for oil in the Great Australian Bight two years after being asked and after two failed applications to drill have been lodged,” he said. “Maybe BP realised that the public may be shocked that BP wants to conduct exploration drilling in the most biologically important part of the Great Australian Bight, the Commonwealth Marine Reserve, which was designed to protect the Bight’s extraordinary marine life.” In 2010, BP was responsible for the world’s largest oils spill – the Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico – which occurred in calmer and more shallow waters than those in the bight. Modelling of a potential oil spill in the Great Australian Bight, commissioned by the Wilderness Society in 2015, showed it could affect most of Australia’s southern coastline, shutting down fisheries and threatening wildlife including whales, seabirds and sea lions. The Great Australian Bight Commonwealth Marine Park was created in 2005 and extended in 2012 to become part of the Great Australian Bight Commonwealth Marine Reserve. When the Abbott government was elected, they began a “review” of the marine parks, which suspended the implementation of their management, making the parks mostly meaningless. "
