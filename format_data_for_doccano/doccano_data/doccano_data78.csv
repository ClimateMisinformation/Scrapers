How many more of these are we going to need? I don’t know why there are still people out there who deny what ought to be obvious.
==============================
New Norwegian studies: A significant part of climate warming of the last 150 years is caused by the sun
By Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt (translated by P Gosselin with permission)

Three Norwegian scientists, led by astrophysicist Jan-Erik Solheim of Oslo, have taken a close look at the interaction between the temperature development on Earth and solar activity in the past. The scientists investigated the length of individual Schwabe solar sunspot cycles since 1850 until today and found a systematic correlation with the annual mean temperature of the subsequent cycle.
Here the scientists analyzed temperature data from Norway, Spitzbergen and other North European weather stations. Normally a sunspot cycle is about 11 years on average. If the cycle is longer, then it is a sign for a solar activity slumber. Solheim and his colleagues Kjell Stordahl and Ole Humlum have now been able to determine that the temperature lowered after a long and weak solar cycle. The temperature rose accordingly after a short and intense cycle. This points to a time delay of about 1 decade between the heat impact of the sun and the climatic reaction on Earth.

The length of individual Schwabe sunspot cycles correlates well with the annual mean temperature of the subsequent cycle (see diagram middle right). Example Tromsoe, from Solheim et al. (2011a).
Because the last Solar Cycle No. 23 was significantly longer (see p. 299-302, “Die kalte Sonne”) and by looking at the empirically obtained interrelation, the scientists expect an imminent cooling at Spitzbergen of several degrees Celsius (Solheim et al. 2011b). On a Norwegian and global scale, that could translate to up to 1°C (Solheim et al. 2011a, 2012). Moreover, using their correlation data, the Norwegian scientists estimate that about half of the warming since 1850 was caused by the sun.
In a parallel study, the Norwegian trio investigated the temperature history of the last 4000 years using the Greenland GISP ice core. Here the scientists found a characteristic temperature cycle with a period of about 1000 years. In the Greenland temperature curve it is plain to see the Minoic Warm Phase (3000 years ago), the Roman Warm Phase (2000 years ago), and the Medieval Warm Phase (1000 years ago) and today’s Modern Warm Phase. Cold periods occurred between these warm phases, with temperatures dropping more than 1°C. According to Humlum et al. (2011) the logical continuation of this natural cycle indicates that a large part of the 20th century warming is due to natural climate mechanisms (assumed to be foremost the sun).

Share this...FacebookTwitterEver wonder how climate change in the past could ever have been posible without CO2 changes? Some people, like Prof. Michael E. Mann, think it wasn’t possible and that climate was always steady back then.Mann even fabricated a hockey stick chart to precisely show that – until 1850 that is. Then man got smart, industrialized, and everything went to hell.
Well, there’s yet another temperature reconstruction out there showing once again Michael Mann was wrong, and that the climate often went to hell in the past too.
The latest proxy reconstruction comes from a German peat bog and goes back 2000 years. And in case you haven’t guessed it by now, temperatures were all over the place. So much so, that the researchers themselves even express they can’t believe their own results.
A new paper by Moschen et al appearing ain the journal Climate of the Past presents a high resolution reconstruction of local growing season temperature (GST) anomalies at Dürres Maar, Germany over the last two thousand years.
In 2007, a 5.5 m long core was recovered from the centre of Dürres Maar peat bog in the mountainous West Eifel Volcanic Field in southwestern Germany.
According to the paper’s abstract (emphasis added):
The temperature reconstruction is based on the Sphagnum δ13Ccellulose /temperature dependency observed in calibration studies. Reconstructed GST anomalies show considerable centennial and decadal scale variability. A cold and presumably also wet phase with below-average temperature is reconstructed between the 4th and 7th century AD which is in accordance with the so called European Migration Period marking the transition from the Late Roman Period to the Early Middle Ages. At High Medieval Times above-average temperatures are obvious followed by a temperature decrease.
I got a copy of the paper from a source, who wrote: “The ex-hockey team will hate it”.  The paper’s Figure 6 tells quite the story. Indeed there was a lot of climate change in the past when CO2 was more or less stagnant. Look at the huge variations 1000 years ago! Obviously natural factors truly do exist. The Medieval Warm Period is shown again to be just as warm, if not warmer than today.
As reader DirkH points out in a comment, even the researchers have great difficulty coming to terms with their own results.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWe know that Marc Morano’s latest headline is about Al Gore going ballistic in a cuss-laden tirade against growing global skepticism – probably venting his pent up anger over his evaporating investments and reputation. Anthony Watts also fills us in on that padded-room incident.

So this is as good a time as any to bring you the latest video of Marc Morano and his latest assessment of the global warming movement.
Some of the more notable quotes Morano makes:
…real world data are showing that the global warming alarm spread by Al Gore and the United Nations is in utter collapse…across the board what we thought we knew about climate just 4 or 5 years ago is now in utter collapse – we call it sub-prime science…UN scientists were trying to act as gatekeepers of peer review, they were trying to shut out people like Roy Spencer…peer review is still a corrupted process…It’s always been a political movement…akin to Nostradamus…”

Share this...FacebookTwitterSome news that may help European meteorologists with their seasonal forecasts in the future. We know that last fall many predicted a hard winter for Europe, and just the opposite is now occurring. What I find interesting is how the new paper reminds us of the proper way to build a model.
A team of climate scientists  led by Dr. Daniela Matei and Prof. Dr. Jochem Marotzke of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI-M) and Prof. Dr. Johanna Baehr from Hamburg University’s Cluster of Excellence “CliSAP” have shown for the first time that the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) at 26.5 °N can be skillfully predicted for up to four years.
This can be important because, according to their press release:
The AMOC – known as “Gulf Stream” – transports warm surface waters into the high latitudes, where they cool, sink and return southwards at depth as cold North Atlantic Deep Water. Variations in AMOC can significantly affect the northward ocean heat transport and therefore the European and North Atlantic climate. Through its influence on sea surface temperature (SST), AMOC can further impact climate phenomena such as Sahel droughts or the frequency of Atlantic hurricanes. Therefore, it is of outmost importance to be able to predict these climate variations on a time horizon from years to decades.”
“Climate variations” here is the key. The authors explain the proper approach for making mid-term climate predictions in general:

In the near term (inter-annual to decadal timescales), climate variations are influenced by both anthropogenic forcing and natural variability. […] The skill of any prediction system is assessed retrospectively, by performing the so-called “hindcast” or “retrospective forecast” and comparing them with observations.”
Oh really! This is almost what the IPCC does with its famous climate models, but with a small difference of course. In the IPCC models, there are always huge discrepancies between the hindcast and observations. No problem though. The IPCC modellers simply apply the ever so versatile aerosol fudge factor wherever needed, and presto! CO2 is always the big driver and the significant natural cycles are reduced to nothing.
I don’t know if Drs. Matei and Marotzke of the MPI-M produce models for the IPCC, but if so, all they have to do now is take the same approach they mention above and include the other (very well-known, at least to the rest of the world) natural cycles like the PDO, AMO, NAO, solar, etc. in their climate models. If they did that, they would quickly discover that they could do away with the massive aerosol fudging and actually produce a multi-decadal model that works. Of course, the IPCC may not be happy with the result.
If they don’t make climate models for the IPCC, then they should at least give their climate modelling colleagues a hint or two.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIPCC Forecasts For Warm Winters Are Completely Wrong
By Matti Vooro
The headline on recent news clipping reads Toll from Europe Freeze tops 220, see here and here. Reading news clips about the current weather in Europe and Asia and then comparing that to what IPCC said in its 2007 report about what Europeans should expect for future winter weather is as if the IPCC was predicting the climate for another planet.

Fig. 1: European winter temperature deviations from the 1961 – 1990 base for the years 1998-2010. Blue = Europe winter temp, black line = linear trend.
The latest death count is over 300 now. You just cannot be this far off in your forecasts and claim that this is based on any credible climate science supported by most climate scientists. If it is supported by most climate scientists, then we have serious science credibility problems here for Europe.
Here is what the IPCC predicted earlier (emphasis added):
Assessments of projected climate change for Europe:
Annual mean temperatures in Europe are likely to increase more than the global mean. The warming in northern Europe is likely to be largest in winter and that in the Mediterranean area largest in summer. The lowest winter temperatures are likely to increase more than average winter temperature in northern Europe, and the highest summer temperatures are likely to increase more than average summer temperature in southern and central Europe.

Annual precipitation is very likely to increase in most of northern Europe and decrease in most of the Mediterranean area. In central Europe, precipitation is likely to increase in winter but decrease in summer. Extremes of daily
precipitation are very likely to increase in northern Europe. The annual number of precipitation days is very likely to decrease in the Mediterranean area. The risk of summer drought is likely to increase in central Europe and in the Mediterranean area.
Confidence in future changes in windiness is relatively low, but it seems more likely than not that there will be an increase in average and extreme wind speeds in northern Europe.
The duration of the snow season is very likely to shorten in all of Europe, and snow depth is likely to decrease in at least most of Europe.”
This is now the fourth of such cold winters for Europe depending on the individual country.  Europe’s and Berlin‘s winter temperatures show a linear decline since 1998 (See Figure 1) and more seriously with very cold winters since after 2007 and 2008, See the two charts at the bottom of this article.
Other scientists have noted that Northern Europe and Asia have had cooling winters since 1988 or for two decades now as noted below. So this is not just a new development but that the cooling has been coming now for a decade or more. So how could IPCC be so wrong only a few years ago? 
A recent technical paper called Arctic warming, increasing snow cover and widespread boreal winter cooling, Judah L Cohen1 et al:
Record cold snaps and heavy snowfall events across the United States, Europe and East Asia garnered much public attention during the winters of 2009/10 and 2010/11 (Blunden et al 2011, Cohen et al2010). Cohen et al (2009) argued that the occurrence of more severe NH winter weather is a two-decade-long trend starting around 1988.”
So it is heartening to read just recently in the news that some German mainstream media have finally seen the light and have exposed the IPCC science as being flawed and no longer credible for planning our future and are beginning to ask the type of questions that should have been asked all along. It is unfortunate that hundreds of people had to die before we start doing proper planning for the colder winters that may lie ahead.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhat follows is a good overview explaining why the measurement of Global Mean Sea Level (GMSL) is fraught with much uncertainty and so subject to substantial error. Michael Limburg of the European Institute for Climate and Energy tells us why.

On Determining Global Mean Sea Level
by Dipl.-Ing. Michael Limburg
An exact determination of GMSL is a very difficult if not a fundamentally impossible task. Even more difficult is determining sea level rise (or drop) over time. Different authors using the same datasets arrive at completely different results. It’s little wonder sea level expert W. Siefert in Hamburg recently said in an interview: “When examined closely, sea level is being exposed more and more as a pure mathematical prop, inadequate and, foremost, not very meaningful. Especially when it is to be used as a sole standard of measure, or used to derive horror scenarios…(1)“
This is also confirmed by researchers like Douglas [Douglas, 1994], who illustrated in great detail why e.g. Barnett (1984), Emery and Aubry (1991) Pirazzoli (1993) concluded:
…the determination of a single sea-level curve of global applicability is an illusory task.”
Douglas hoped that improved research instruments would bring better and more reliable results in the years ahead. And with the possibilities presented by satellite altimetry, these results may now be at hand. But so far mostly controversial results have been produced and no really reliable findings have been gained.
And later, in spite of the many new instruments and techniques that can now be used to find the much sought signal of global warming on GMSL, they say…
…these tools seem to have raised more questions than they have answered.”
Obtainable accuracy
It must also be allowed to say that a claimed measurement accuracy of a few tenths of a millimetre per year for the (only measurable) Relative Sea Level (RSL) and the GMSL are not possible with the available historical data. Only the newest satellite altimetry tools may allow this in principle. Therefore using the unit of measure “mm” is grossly misleading. The IPCC,  many experts, publicly informed media, and laymen are hence falsely claiming an accuracy that simply cannot be reached. These figures are computed values only.
In reality sea level changes can be measured accurately only to centimetres, and often only to within several centimetres – and very often not even that. Munk [Munk, 2003] (3) confirms this writing that…:
“…the jury is still out on the interpretation of the tide gauge records.”
For sea level and for trends from global historical temperature data, the old saying of Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) – known as a great inventor of many basic statistical principles and algorithm – remains true:
Nothing shows a lack of mathematical understanding more than an exaggeratedly accurate calculation.”
Therefore the only thing certain is that the statistical construct of GMSL over the last 120 years indicates a rise of between 10 and 20 cm/century. The error lies in the scale of the calculated value, and likely may be even higher. While Mörner expects a mean rise of 10 cm/century, the IPCC (AR4) sees approx. 19 cm/century. Today IPCC experts see an increase in the rate of rise over the last 20 years, while others explicitly exclude such a rate increase.
Why all the uncetrtainty?

It is due to built-in systematc errors. Many of these errors are widely unknown in their historical size, appearance and direction. They are included in the data and they involve an array of factors such as: dtermination of sea level measurement reference points, datasets of various lengths, contaminated datasets, rapid shifting of tectonic plates and their vertical components, barometric pressure, density of water, etc, etc.
A close analysis of all these error factors indicate that the errors are of a systematic nature and, because they are mostly subtle, they cannot be determined on the scale of the sought local sea level rise. Therefore they have to be indicated using error bars in accordance with good scientific practice. But this has very rarely been done. Credible figures regarding the attainable accuracy are as a rule the exception, e.g. Mörner +10 ± 10 cm by the year 2100 (or + 5 ± 15 cm) [Mörner, 2004] (2). Anything else has to be taken with much caution.
Assigning the causes of sea level rise
Detailed attempts to determine GMSLR are made by authors of the IPCC and others by breaking it down into various components. But one has to keep in mind that that this approach is prone to failure. Cazenave et al [Cazenave, 2004] is quoted on this:
…for the past 50 years, sea-level trends caused by change in ocean heat storage also show high regional variability,” ´
and
..has led to questions about whether the rate of 20th-century sea-level rise, based on poorly distributed historical tide gauges, is really representative of the true global mean.”
The estimates for eustatic and steric components cannot be brought in agreement with the observed data. The movement of single tectonic plates with speeds in the range of more than 15 cm/year, the vertical components therein, which can decisively impact the volume of the ocean above it, is certainly a cause of the observed changes in RSL and thus GMSL. But recording these changes and quantitively attributing them to a source has been impossible up to now.
Also a potential temperature-dependency is not detectable over the last 1000 years, as clearly shown by Storch et. al [Storch, 2008] (5). In their model that looks back, they did not find any correlation between sea level trend and temperature.
For all measurement locations, sea level changes can be more easily attributed to natural changes (glacial isostatic adjustment GIA / post glacial rebound PGR or other tectonic shifts) or, similar to the UHI for temperature, attributed indeed to man-made social-economic factors, e.g. urban growth and thus sinking. A greenhouse effect is not necessarily needed to explain it. This means future projections of the GMSL are purely speculative because of the great lack of understanding of the involved processes and the lack of data.
Nothing makes this more explicit than the wide range of estimates among IPCC lead authors (e.g. Rahmstorf) and other specialists: Jevreva, Mörner or Singer. Rahmstorf [Rahmstorf, 2007a](4) believes a maximum of 140 cm is possible by the end of the century, James Hansen estimates up to 600 cm under certain conditions, the IPCC shows estimates between 14 to 59 cm (final), Singer only 18-20 cm, and Mörner [Mörner, 2004] a mere 10 cm. This might be the reason why the IPCC authors are unusually cautious ( see for reference AR4 of WG I Observations: Oceanic Climate Change and Sea Level on page 410 Chapter 5.5.2.):
…there is an increasing opinion that the best estimate lies closer to 2 mm/yr than to 1 mm/yr…”
Conclusion
When basing conclusions solely on the ever-escalating opinions of a few scientists – some of them well known for blowing the horn of alarmism – political leaders should not decide on extremely costly measures to curb completely doubtful global sea leve rise, which is a mere statistical construct from the very beginning.
The only rational conclusion one can draw is: All global mean sea level rise claims with an accuracy of better than ± 10 cm/century have to be taken with great caution. Breaking down the rise into components and attributing a respective rise to each, especially to temperature rise, is not possible with today’s level of knowledge. Each assignment of factors is simply too speculative.

As  the skeptic book sweeps across Central Europe, its launch was accompanied by a nasty cold snap over the first half of February. The online Swiss magazine Blick writes:
February 2012 is among the 10 coldest February months since measurements began 150 years ago. The cold wave in the first half of the month was the most intensive in 27 years, MeteoSchweiz reported on Tuesday.”
The German Weather Service (DWD) reported that Germany had its coldest February in 26 years, saying that…
…at times February, 2012 could be compared to the harsh winters of 1963, 1956 or 1929.”
The cold snap was particularly harsh across Eastern Europe, with hundreds of people dying of the cold. According to the online Russian Ria Novosti:
The worst cold in Russia’s south for the past twenty-five years caused a disaster for the country’s vineyards, which is comparable to the damage inflicted by the anti-alcohol campaign initiated by former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, the Argumenty Nedeli weekly newspaper reported on Wednesday. The temperatures, which plunged to minus 25 degrees Celsius (minus 13 degrees Fahrenheit) in February, destroyed over a half the vineyards on the Taman Peninsula and the Krasnodar Territory.”

"A coalition of major City investors have emerged as key players in forcing BP to be more transparent in how it fights climate change. Investors holding just under a tenth of all BP shares, equivalent to more than £10bn in value at Monday’s prices, put their names to the shareholder resolution, to be voted on at the company’s annual meeting next week, the Climate Action 100+ investor group revealed on Tuesday. The resolution is thought to represent the strongest level of support for a climate-related resolution at a major publicly listed company. Under the Climate Action 100+ resolution, BP will have to provide a detailed strategy on how it will comply with the Paris agreement, the global deal reached in 2015 on climate change that aims to limit global warming to only 1.5ºC above pre-industrial levels. Seven of the top 20 BP shareholders co-filed the resolution, including the UK’s biggest asset manager, Legal & General Investment Management, as well as Aviva Investors and M&G Investments. Other major investors who signed up to the resolution included Royal London Asset Management, Schroders, UBS Asset Management, Jupiter Asset Management and the pension funds of the churches of England, Scotland and Wales. Steve Waygood, chief responsible investment officer at Aviva Investors, described the resolution as only the first step in tackling the climate emergency. He said: “The scientific consensus is crystal clear on the need for far-reaching action by corporates, with the next decade critical in limiting global warming to 1.5°C. Investors have a responsibility to hold companies to account and to ensure they consider their alignment with the Paris agreement.” However, the resolution has faced criticism because it stops short of mandating emissions targets, which include all of the greenhouse gases produced when BP’s products are burned, known as “scope 3” emissions, on top of BP’s own operational emissions. BP has opposed another resolution, co-ordinated by the campaign group Follow This, which would force the company to set targets to reduce total emissions from BP fuel. Mark van Baal, the founder of Follow This, said: “BP does not want to take responsibility for the admissions for their products. “As long as an oil major has no targets for scope 3 they can never say they are committed to the Paris agreement.” The Follow This resolution is expected to receive support from multiple major investors but the presence of a separate, less strict resolution may mean fewer back it. Aegon, the Dutch insurer and investor, has committed to vote in favour of the carbon limits. Eric Rutten, chair of Aegon’s responsible investment committee, said: “These large oil and gas companies should follow Shell’s example to play a leading role in the transition to climate-neutral energy supply.” Investors in the Climate Action 100+ initiative, including some who proposed the BP resolution, were part of the coalition in December 2018 that forced Shell to commit to carbon targets that included its products, a much tougher requirement than that demanded of BP. Shell executive pay is also linked to the targets. The resolution backed by BP includes a commitment to measure scope 3 emissions. The company will also have to provide details of how new investments will meet the Paris goals, what metrics it uses to measure its success and its progress on combating climate change during the past year. Oil and other fossil fuel extractors have come under particular pressure in recent years as the scientific and diplomatic consensus has acknowledged the need for immediate and radical action to reduce carbon emissions in order to prevent catastrophic climate change. The pressure on oil companies has been heightened by recent Extinction Rebellion climate protests and the declaration by MPs that the UK faces a climate emergency."

Solyndra was a showcase for the government’s investment in environmentally friendly technologies. The company received more than half a billion dollars in state credit guarantees. Among others, President Obama, former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and Energy Secretary Steven Chu visited the plant.”
According to san francisco.cbslocal.com here/:
Solyndra said as a result of the suspension of operations, some 1,100 full-time and temporary employees were being laid off effective immediately.
Solyndra workers learned as they arrived at the office that the recently-completed Fremont factory where they worked would be closing immediately.”
I heard of this news from an obscure Swiss news outlet, and not a peep from the national MSM. The MSM we recall are too busy hyping up tropical storms into “monster hurricanes of the century” and propping up the climate change hoax, which in turn leads to mega-failures like Solyndra. So is the media today.
Meanwhile the US economy is falling apart and people are losing hope with every false promise politicians make. The green economy is total pie-in-the sky. Sadly 1100 employees and their families are finding this out the hard way.

"Scott Morrison has been highly successful during this campaign at keeping the focus on Bill Shorten and Labor policies. He has presented the Coalition as the “nothing to see here” status quo option. In contrast, his opponents have been cast as the purveyors of radical change Australia doesn’t need. The Liberal leader has been running dead on his own agenda, and deliberately so, to ensure that all voter eyes are trained on the (risky) alternative. But despite the Seinfeld campaign, the Coalition isn’t actually seeking a mandate to do nothing. As the contest moves into the final week, it’s time to kick the tyres of Morrison’s deft “move on calmly, nothing to see here” campaign impressionism.  There are a few ways we could do this, but one obvious way in is through tax policy. The Coalition’s long-term tax cuts haven’t commanded a massive amount of deep focus for a few reasons. At budget time, all the attention was on the Coalition offering tax cuts for low and middle-income earners to try to neutralise a similar election offering by Labor. There wasn’t much attention paid to the tax relief for high-income earners slated for down the track, because it was unclear whether Morrison would win the current election, let alone be in a position to legislate a program taking effect between 2022 and 2025. The medium-term agenda attracted a significant discount rate. As well as the whole idea seeming reasonably hypothetical, there was a second, conceptual, discount factor. The generosity of the tax relief proposed for up the income scales doesn’t sit comfortably with the uncertain state of the economy. It seemed likely that the Senate, if presented with the whole package post-election, and told to take it or leave it, could elect to leave it on the basis it’s not prudent to bake in tax cuts at a time of pervasive economic uncertainty. So the sum of all the discount factors is the Coalition’s tax package has largely washed through the election conversation without troubling anyone much, apart from appearing as an abbreviated talking point – we’ll give you a nice tax cut and Labor will increase taxes. But the fact of the matter is the Coalition’s policy is not status quo, nor “nothing to see here”, but instead, a significant change to how the system works now. A couple of experts quoted in a recent ABC Fact Check noted that the package outlined in the April budget would reduce the progressivity of Australia’s tax system. Morrison and the treasurer Josh Frydenberg have been deeply reluctant throughout the campaign to quantify in dollar terms the tax relief that will flow to high income earners – to people earning $180,000 a year. The progressive think-tank the Australia Institute has calculated that figure at $77bn over 10 years. The two tax experts quoted by the ABC Fact Check, the Grattan Institute’s Danielle Wood and the Australian National University’s Ben Phillips, say the figure is more like $88bn or $89bn. The government won’t quantify the figure itself because it does not want to hand Labor a concrete attack point it can weaponise before election day. Another element related to the tax package was flagged by Wood early in the campaign, but the cut-through point she made hasn’t really lingered in the daily hustings conversation. Wood noted that in order to be able to afford the high-end tax cuts and keep the budget in surplus, the Coalition would need to cut spending by about $40bn a year by 2030. Faced with this inconvenient fine print, Morrison promptly declared poppycock, but Wood – a respected economic analyst – doesn’t resile from her calculations and, assuming she’s right, that points to the risk of a significant round of expenditure cuts that have not been disclosed to voters before voting day. Tony Abbott walked that same path in 2013 and his story did not end happily. The other clever teflon strategy Morrison has deployed during this campaign has been to detach himself from the dead weight of the Coalition’s period in government. He’s done laps of the country as a solo act to project lightness and agility and energy to voters – to present the impression of a political leader in sole command of his enterprise. Now if Morrison pulls off a victory, there’s no doubt his internal authority will be enhanced, because he will have achieved something that seemed impossible at the time when collective despair descended inside the government after Malcolm Turnbull was deposed last year. If Abbott loses in Warringah (and I have no idea how realistic that prospect is), that will also make life easier for the Liberals to rebuild and steady the enterprise either in government or opposition, because a long cycle of destruction will be broken. But whatever the abundant gratitude of colleagues post-election, if they find themselves on the government benches against expectations, Morrison will not be in solo command of his enterprise. It’s just not the real world. Sitting – comfortably obscured behind Morrison’s cheery five-week circumnavigation – is a battle for the leadership of the National party that will blow up after the election if the gritted teeth behind the scenes are a reliable measure, particularly if the election doesn’t go well for the junior Coalition partner. The Liberals will continue to struggle to agree on things they have spent a couple of terms struggling to agree on. This government roiled right up until the moment when Morrison took himself to the prime minister’s courtyard after visiting the governor-general – and the only thing forcing discipline now is the discipline of people trying to hold their seats. Morrison had a couple of formulations this week about how he has led and would lead his fractious political organisation. On the ABC, he first declared he was in full command of the show. In the last leaders’ debate, he said he led from the “middle” – a reference to balancing the sensibilities of the right and the left. In fairness to the current Liberal leader, he’s done that better than either Turnbull or Abbott. That was Morrison’s main claim to the top job when he faced off against Peter Dutton last year. But with due credit to the massaging given, there remains one live litmus test of who really runs the Liberal party in 2019, and it’s on an issue that sits at the front of many voters’ minds in this election. It’s climate change. Morrison made a big show in the months before the election of executing a positive pivot on climate change, backing renewable energy projects, rebooting the emissions reduction fund, and at one stage, declining to utter the word coal in deference to metropolitan progressive Liberal sensibilities. But the election campaign – all the hyperbolic shouting about the costs of climate action, the self-interested and cynical critiques of Labor’s decision to use international permits to lower the cost of abatement (a position the Coalition adopted in 2017 and abandoned only with the election in sight), and the “Labor’s secret plan to confiscate your ute” hyperventilation – speak volumes about who runs the show and Morrison’s inability to move the internal dial to something like a neutral position on the most important policy challenge of our time. The Coalition remains deeply regressive on climate action. One Liberal said to me this week: every time we talk about climate change, it hurts us with middle Australia. Right now it’s hard to say with any certainty just how much, but we’ll find out next Saturday night."
"For supporters of Liverpool, Spurs, Arsenal and Chelsea it has been quite a week. First they had the joy of seeing their teams get through to the finals of Europe’s two cup competitions: the only time there has been a clean sweep by English clubs. After the euphoria, though, came a hard lesson in basic economics. As the final whistle blew at Anfield, following Liverpool’s amazing comeback against Barcelona, anyone logging on to airline websites found the price of a ticket to Madrid – where the final of the Champions League will be held – had rocketed to more than £700 on the weekend of the match. When Spurs scored a last-minute winner against Ajax to join Liverpool in the final, prices rose again and not just for direct flights to Madrid but for alternative routes as well.  The price of accommodation in the Spanish capital also rocketed. Hotels jacked up their prices, as did those who let out their properties on Airbnb. The going rate for a two-night stay in a flat in Madrid over the Champions League final weekend is more than £1,000. Despite all the talk of supporters being gouged, this is the way markets work. There are a limited number of places to stay in Madrid and on May 31 and June 1, there will be a lot more people in need of them. If supply remains constant and demand goes up, then prices will rise. Liverpool and Spurs supporters had a choice. They could have decided the prices of airline tickets and accommodation were too high and refused to pay them. In those circumstances, prices would have come down. Instead, they paid up, fearing delay would only mean paying more later. If it is any comfort to football fans as they contemplate receiving whopping credit card bills, there are some less painful economic lessons from this year’s Champions League. The first is that management matters. Studies of UK productivity have shown there are vast differences between firms. Those that export perform more strongly than those that are purely domestically focused. In addition, those that are foreign-owned and managed do better than those run by Britons. In this light, it is significant that all four of the English clubs in this year’s finals have foreign coaches: Jürgen Klopp at Liverpool: Mauricio Pochettino at Spurs; Unai Emery at Arsenal and Maurizio Sarri at Chelsea. A second is that football is one of the very few areas of the economy where the workers hold the whip hand over management. The TV rights for broadcasting Premier League matches are a goldmine but the real beneficiaries have not been the owners but the players. The pool of star players is limited and probably no bigger or smaller than it ever was. What’s changed is that the TV billions have come rolling in. The competition for talent coupled with the worldwide appeal of the Premier League has allowed the Paul Pogbas and the Eden Hazards to bid up the price of their labour. Too much money chasing too few goods tends to lead to inflation, and the salaries of Premier League footballers are proof of that. The lesson provided by one Ajax, of the losing Champions League finalists is that investment in human capital matters. The Dutch club lack the financial clout of some of their European rivals but made up for it by nurturing young talent. As an example of the importance of training and skills to successful outcomes, the story of Ajax is hard to beat. But in football as in every business there is potential free-rider problem. Companies that have deep pockets don’t bother to invest in their own human capital but simply entice talent away from those that do by offering big reward packages. Ajax thrashed two clubs with extremely deep pockets – Real Madrid and Juventus – en route to the semi-final but the team will be broken up this summer. The final economics lesson from this year’s Champions League is one that has yet to be learned but needs to be: namely that environmental sustainability has to play a central role in decision making. Uefa, European football’s governing body, decided before the season started that the finals of its two competitions would be held in Madrid and Baku, yet now finds that all four finalists are from England. The result is that airlines get a windfall, as do the hotels and restaurants of Madrid and Baku, but at the cost of an enormous carbon footprint. From a climate change perspective, having Liverpool and Spurs jet off to Spain while Arsenal and Chelsea supporters make their way to Azerbaijan, is little short of disastrous. Last year, the final between Liverpool and Real Madrid was held in Kiev. Uefa needs to be held to account for this because it is clearly unsustainable. Last year’s Champions’ League final should have been held in Paris and this year’s finals should be in London or Cardiff. The idea that this would cause insurmountable logistical problems does not wash. In the bygone days before FA cup semi-finals were held at Wembley, neutral grounds were chosen once it was known which teams were playing each other. If Arsenal was playing Manchester United, for example, the likeliest venue was Villa Park in Birmingham. With a bit of planning, Uefa ought to be able to adopt a similar approach. As soon as it was known that the four semi-finalists for the Champions League were Liverpool, Spurs, Ajax and Barcelona, there were two obvious choices for the final: London or Paris. Football is influential. It needs to start taking climate change seriously."
"I’m no expert on Australian politics – I don’t know all the cross-currents that will determine this week’s balloting. But I do know a fair amount about the climate crisis, having written the first book on the subject back in 1989. So I can say with confidence that if Australians want to play a serious role in fixing the greatest challenge we’ve ever faced, this may be about the last election where people retain enough leverage to make a real difference.  Global warming, after all, is a math problem: how quickly can we reverse the flow of carbon into the atmosphere? The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, in its report last year, said that unless a fundamental transformation was fully underway by 2030, we stood no chance of meeting the targets the world set in the Paris climate accords. No matter what country you’re in, “fundamental transformations” don’t come overnight; if you want to dramatically trim carbon emissions in 2030, it means you better start in 2020. That means that if Aussie politicians of all stripes are still passing around lumps of coal and fantasising about huge new coal mines, that’s not going to happen. The good news is, if you want change, the timing couldn’t be better: the engineers have done their job so well that the cost of renewable energy just keeps falling. In much of the world it’s now the cheapest way to produce electrons (and that’s even without charging fossil fuel a penny for the damage it’s doing). That means we’re in a position to make truly fast strides in the right direction (especially those of us lucky enough to live on a continent washed by wind and bathed in the rays of the sun). Not only that, but we’re in a “climate moment” around the globe. It’s been inspiring to watch the pictures on social media of young Australians joining the climate strikes now breaking out around the world; their British counterparts, and their older colleagues at Extinction Rebellion, were enough to convince the Tory-led British Parliament to pass a declaration of “climate emergency” last month. Even in Donald Trump’s United States the Green New Deal keeps gaining momentum – most of the Democrats vying to replace him are calling for a concerted response to an “existential risk”. None of it will be easy, of course – the fossil fuel industry continues to flex its considerable muscle around the world, and nowhere more than Australia. Watching the environment minister forced to disregard obvious science and instead rubberstamp proposals for groundwater plans for the Adani mega-mine are just the latest reminder of how the barons of this eighteenth century technology dominate Canberra. Reading that Tony Abbott bet $100 that the climate will not change over the next decade is the latest reminder of the pervasive intellectual dishonesty necessary to prop up the status quo. Australians literally watched hot water kill off huge swaths of the Great Barrier Reef in two years. Hell, you’ve watched wildfires wipe out suburbs in two hours. A decade is an eternity in climate time now. We’ve wasted three decades since scientists first raised the warning – that’s guaranteed that we’ll have massive increases in temperature.It means we’ve run out of decades to waste, and hence of elections to waste. Every election matters – it registers who we are at a certain moment in history, and it sets the course of the next few years. But this election will matter forever.

A reader who goes by the name of “renewable guy” and I had a recent exchange on the credibility of James Hansen and his crew at GISS a short time ago.  He gave me the following list of 9 observations to support Hansen and GISS:
1. “Observations show that the planet is changing in accordance with global warming theory.”
It is nice to see someone admit it is a theory rather than “settled science.”
2. “The evidence for global warming is being meticulously accumulated by scientists all over the world. This evidence includes the independent observations that paint a consistent picture of global warming. Our planet is suffering an energy imbalance and is steadily accumulating heat (Hansen 2005, Murphy 2009, von Schuckmann 2009, Trenberth 2009)”
Not quite. See here. All the papers in the list above depend on models. When actual data is used no heat accumulation is seen. For sea surface temperature changes see: read here.
3. “The height of the tropopause is increasing (Santer 2003, press release).”
Two related papers, the first one refutes Santer: read here and here. Figure 9 of the second paper by Hoinka shows no long term trend of tropopause height over the period 1979 thru 1993. There is however, great year to year variability.
4. “Jet streams are moving poleward (Archer 2008, Seidel 2007, Fu 2006).”
Not anymore. The ozone hole closing is counter-acting the warming affect. But this study is still using models, read here. The models depend on the temperature increasing. What if the temperature doesn’t follow the rules? And it has not over the last decade plus.
5. “The tropical belt is widening (Seidel 2007, Fu 2006).”
Same as above; two sides of the same coin. If the jets move poleward, the tropical zone gets wider.

6. “There is an increasing trend in record hot days versus record cold temperatures with currently twice as many record hot days than record cold temperatures (Meehle 2009, see press release).”
Have you heard of UHI? Here is an excellent compendium of the problem. Even NOAA knows the truth about that, and has known it for over 20 years, read here. There is also the increased reporting phenomenon; blame the Internet. This, and satellites, are responsible for much of the recent extreme weather reporting. NASA also knows.
7. “A shift towards earlier seasons (Stine 2009).”
I found this paper change was 1.7 days over 50 years. There are cyclic changes in temperature. The beginning year in this study was 1954, a relatively cool year for the twentieth century. If the study had begun 20 years earlier, the change would have been smaller, see here. The earth has been slowly warming since the end of the Little Ice Age. Seasons were much longer during the Medieval Warm Period, when grapes were cultivated in Scotland, as they can be cultivated now (with proper care, it’s still not as warm as southern England). In the last two thousand years, there have been two other periods when the growing season in northern Europe was as long as now: the Roman Warm Period, and the Medieval Warm Period. The cycle is now turning colder and will repeat learn about it here.
8. “Cooling and contraction of the upper atmosphere consistent with predicted effects of increasing greenhouse gases (Lastovicka 2008).”
Not quite, the sun has a much larger effect: read and learn something here.
9. “Lake warming (Schneider & Hook 2010).”
Sure, since 1985. Look again in another 25 years. All the above points have the same problem. If you look at a particular section of data, or a model, for just a few years, trends can be seen that disappear over a longer time interval. The sun and long ocean cycles last from 70 to several hundred years. Making judgements over shorter intervals is foolish.
Models have problems such as lack of spatial and time resolution, and assumptions that may or may not correspond to how nature actually works. Due to the complexity of the actual climate system, even a tiny piece of garbage in the input to a climate model will quickly make the output all garbage. If one knows anything about Chaos Theory, one will doubt any present or even future climate model.
The sun, ocean cycles, recovery from the little ice age, and urban heat island effects, account for all but about 0.2 to 0.3 degrees C of the recent warming. Climate sensitivity to CO2 is about 0.5 to 0.6 degrees C for CO2 doubling.

"Thirteen people have been arrested after environmental activists abseiled off the Sydney Harbour Bridge to demand action on climate change. The Greenpeace supporters launched themselves from a public walkway on the western side of the structure at dawn on Tuesday, calling on the major federal political parties to declare a “climate emergency”.  They unfurled banners emblazoned with “100% renewables” and “make coal history” as they dangled beneath the bridge. Officers from NSW Police, with help from PolAir, marine and rescue crews, removed several protesters from the bridge by 8am and arrested 10 people. Three activists remained hanging off the bridge on ropes but were removed and arrested by 9.30am. I am here under a symbol of hope - the Sydney Harbour Bridge - with seven of my fellow Australians who represent the hundreds of thousands of our nation’s people who have already experienced climate disaster.@ScottMorrisonMP it’s time to declare a #climateemergency pic.twitter.com/i0mNumOAYv  All 13 were taken to local police stations for questioning. “Charges are expected,” NSW Police said in a statement Greenpeace Australia Pacific’s chief executive, David Ritter, dismissed questions about the legality of the protest action. Activists on the #sydneyharbourbridge are calling for Scott Morrison to declare a climate emergency and take action.

The protest comes four days before Australians head to the polls in the federal election. The federal Labor senator Kristina Keneally said she didn’t condone the illegal protest but understood the activists’ frustrations. “Right now people are wanting action on climate change, they want a government that takes the issue seriously and takes real action,” she told Sky News on Tuesday. “I don’t agree with these protesters’ methods, (but) I understand their frustrations; it’s one shared by the Australian people.” "
"It brings a whole new meaning to grabbing some grub for lunch. Roasted crickets are to go on sale this week at outlets of a London snack brand – the first time in the UK edible insects will appear on the regular daily menu at a takeaway food chain. The crunchy whole crickets, from Eat Grub, will be available in Abokado shops across London from Tuesday as part of the chain’s new spring menu. The sweet chilli and lime-flavoured snack will join its customisable range of toppings for fresh salads, poke bowls and hotpots, and also be available as bagged snacks alongside nuts, edamame and popcorn.  Environmental experts have long recommended insects as a sustainable food source that could help cut food poverty and reduce the damaging impact of meat production. Insects are also nutritious, containing essential proteins, fats, minerals and amino acids. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization says at least 2 billion people regularly consume insects, and they could help meet the food needs of the world’s growing population. Abokado’s managing director, Kara Alderin, said: “Abokado is all about customisation and offering our customers variety of different options to enhance their meals. We currently have a dozen unique toppings and dressings on offer, and this is an exciting addition to the range.” She said the roasted crickets were “quirky, but packed with flavour and protein they are the way forward in healthy, sustainable snacking”. To win over prospective new shoppers who might balk at bugs for lunch, Abokado will be offering Eat Grub samplings in its 23 stores and as part of local street marketing. Insect products from Eat Grub, a London-based food startup, can now be found in more than 700 outlets across Europe. Sainsbury’s, which was the first UK supermarket to start selling edible insects last November, stocks its Smoky BBQ flavoured crickets. In a report to be published this week, the supermarket is expected to highlight insect protein as a key food of the future. In the UK, food choices are becoming increasingly important in the debate about climate change, reflected in the rise of “flexitarianism”, whereby a largely vegetable-based diet is supplemented occasionally with meat. In the UK, edible insects have so far been predominantly limited to unusual pop-ups or online outlets and feature on a few restaurant menus. For consumers seeking an easier way into insect consumption, pasta, protein bars and granola bars made from insect flour went on sale in Selfridges in January. Eat Grub’s co-founder Shami Radia said: “It’s great to have Abokado supporting us in spreading the grub love; the fun way they approach food and innovation is exactly what we need to make eating insects more mainstream.”"
"Your editorial (13 May) correctly states that Britain needs a Green New Deal now, and indeed in your letters page last autumn (10 September) our report detailing what form such a “jobs in every constituency” Green New Deal could take, and how to pay for it, was supported by a cross-party group of MPs, NGO leaders and academics. Since then the idea has gained international traction thanks to the likes of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the support of grassroots movements. The US approach also includes the need to improve economic security for the majority, which has widened its support base. Finally, the scientific data underscoring the need to act in the next 10 years to tackle climate change and biodiversity loss has resulted in unprecedented activist pressure on politicians to respond. As a result, all opposition parties are calling for the declaration of a climate emergency, but the government’s actual policies – from fracking to the rollback of support for renewables and energy efficiency – are making things worse. Yet all is not lost. At the end of last year more than 60 Tory MPs signed an all-party letter calling on the prime minister to back a net zero-emissions target ahead of 2050. Clearly the disconnect here is the lack of necessary political will. MPs should take inspiration from President Kennedy’s call in 1961 to put a man on the moon within a decade, but this time the priority must be to save the planet, rather than leave it.Colin HinesConvener, UK Green New Deal Group  • Orthodox economic theory is a spent force because it is based on a false premise: the wealth creation delusion. What is termed wealth creation is actually a process that destroys our planet’s natural wealth. Monetary wealth in the form of GDP is attributed to the destructive process to create the delusion of wealth creation. The consequences for our life-giving planetary systems, and ultimately our survival, are fast becoming apparent. We cannot tinker with such a drastically flawed system; we need a new philosophy of the meaning of life and living if we are to sustain human life.

Share this...FacebookTwitterLake Aussenalster in Hamburg, Germany rarely freezes over enough to allow tens of thousands to go skating on it. The ice has to be at leat 18 cm thick before officials declare it safe to walk on. The last time that happened was in 1997. This weekend it was thick enough to do so again.

This of course is because of galloping global warming. I have to point out that it hasn’t frozen completely solid – but solid enough for officials to give the green light for people to walk on without risk. Does anyone have the data on the years it has been officially opened?

"More than 20 native animals would disappear from the Great Dividing Range before the end of the century if global emissions continue at business as usual rates, according to new analysis by Australian researchers. The University of Queensland and Australian Conservation Foundation study, published this week in Global Ecology and Conservation, examines native fauna in a part of the country that is home to three-quarters of the population and much of Australia’s biodiversity. The scientists and policy experts used climate models from the UN’s intergovernmental panel on climate change to assess how many endemic species could face extinction in the Great Dividing Range due to warming temperatures. They examined 1,062 native species, and found 26 would go extinct by 2085 if the currently high global emissions trajectory continues. In that scenario, they assumed global warming of 3.7C by 2085. Of the 26 species the researchers said would not survive, 11 are found only in the Great Dividing Range and nowhere else on earth. Under a lower emissions pathway of 1.8C the Great Dividing Range would become climatically unsuitable for 16 species by 2085, including the 11 endemic species. “The way emissions are tracking, we will lose a raft of species found nowhere else in the world, including the blue-winged parrot, Mount Claro rock wallaby, magnificent brood frog and painted spadefoot toad,” the study’s lead author, Sean Maxwell, said. Another author, James Watson, said: “The fact is that there are 11 endemic species, which based off of this research, it appears they will be blasted off the face of the earth because there’s nowhere suitable for them to live.” “That’s the really sad thing from this piece.” But the researchers identify some hope for the remaining 1,036 animals for which they forecast some climatically suitable habitat would remain even under the most aggressive scenarios they modelled. The paper identifies two large sections of habitat, one in northern Queensland and another in northern New South Wales, that would benefit the survival of hundreds of species if they were protected. Watson said that could be done by governments establishing protected areas in those spaces, or through other means, such as stewardship programs that reward farmers and other landholders who keep habitat intact rather than clear it. Another author, James Trezise from the Australian Conservation Foundation, said the research found at least 673 animals would benefit from protecting intact habitat, which he said was a strong argument for Australian governments prioritising policies to avoid deforestation. They found another 270 species would be heavily reliant on governments committing to restoring habitat areas in southern Queensland, southern NSW and northern Victoria that had already been modified in some form by agriculture and other activities. “We need to rapidly protect critical habitats and climate refuges for species if we are to give wildlife a chance in the face of climate change,” Trezise said. “The next Australian government will have to step up on protecting the environment. This means introducing stronger national environment laws and investing in new protected areas, wildlife corridors and ecosystem restoration.”"
"Modelling by BAEconomics that has been used to attack Labor’s climate policies is a “complete outlier” according to an analysis of more than 20 other recent modelling exercises on the effect of higher climate targets on the economy and electricity sector. The Australia Institute has published a review comparing the work of Brian Fisher with 19 other reports and and three Treasury models that examined the potential effects of higher climate targets.  Ten of those reports examined the economy-wide effects of higher targets, while 12 looked at the impacts on the electricity sector, including five reports modelling 100% renewable energy. The analysis found none of the reports showed greater action to address climate change was “economy wrecking” and that higher targets had, at most, “a very small impact on GDP growth compared to no action”. The Australia Institute’s climate and energy program director, Richie Merzian, said Fisher’s models had put the GDP impacts of climate action at levels five to 10 times higher than every other economy-wide model, including those from Warwick McKibbin, Climateworks, the Australian National University, CSIRO, Victoria University and the three Treasury models. “There is extensive literature on the cost of climate action in Australia including modelling from or commissioned by the government,” Merzian said. “All 22 reports analysed show the cost of higher emission reduction targets is small, even when ignoring the benefits. “Every reputable institution modelling climate costs, including the government’s own economic advisers and Treasury, show higher climate ambition has a negligible impact on the economy.” Fisher’s analysis looked at the cost of Labor’s 45% climate target across a range of scenarios, with and without the use of international permits. It claimed the cumulative costs to GDP could range from $264bn to $542bn between 2020 and 2030. Fisher’s analysis has been widely criticised for, among other things, assumptions about abatement costs that the Australian National University’s Frank Jotzo has said are implausibly high. The Australia Institute analysis finds that economy-wide models in other reports put the impact on GDP growth in every scenario at no more than 1.8% of GDP, but Fisher’s models put lost GDP growth at levels as high as 22%. “Fisher’s claims regarding the so-called huge economy-wide impacts and electricity price hikes are a complete outlier compared to over 20 other pieces of similar research,” Merzian said. “These claims do not stack up against the body of literature available or the actual Australian economic experience during the carbon price period, which saw 2% economic growth with 5% emissions reductions.” The Australia Institute found that the 12 reports examining the electricity sector showed higher ambition targets would reduce power costs, or result in “a modest and manageable increase”, including for 100% renewables. “The majority of Australians want the country to mobilise in a state of emergency to combat climate change with the same cooperation and commitment as a war effort,” Merzian said. “Meanwhile the Coalition government has gone to great lengths to cherry-pick contrary advice and delay serious climate action.” Comment was sought from Fisher."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe climate summit in Durban is coming up and so expect a steady stream of shocking, frightful climate reports to come out over the weeks ahead. The latest comes from the US Department of Energy, which shows that global man-made CO2 emissions have reached shocking record levels.
Last year more than 9100 million tons of CO2 were emitted into the atmosphere. The reaction by the media in Germany today has been one of utter horror.
Global temps fall as CO2 rises to ""record levels"".
I guess the doom and fright that activists feel is understandable: global temperatures today are a whole tenth of a degree Celsius above normal and haven’t risen in about 15 years (in fact they are dropping), the third world countries are developing and living better, and the global economy has rebounded…oh horrors!
The German online CO2 Handel presents a news release from the German Press Agency DPA:
Just weeks before the UN climate conference in Durban South Africa, the US Department of Energy spooks the world with grim news: New preliminary results show that the emissions of the climate-killing gas Co2 is rising dramatically.

Alone in China and India CO2 emissions emissions climbed 10 percent.”
German Green Party Chairwoman Claudia Roth called the latest figures “alarming at an extreme scale.” Eberhard Brandes, Chairman of WWF Germany, is outraged and said: “The data coming out of the USA are shocking and exceed the worst our fears and pessimistic scenarios.” While Halloween takes place one day a year in the USA, in Germany it’s a year-round affair.
In comic fashion, the German Press Agency DPA blasted and blamed the USA, but then added:
The international community of nations has failed miserably.” In the USA CO2 emissions compared to last year decreased – in Germany on the other hand they increased.”
Decreased? Who cares – let’s blame the capitalists any way.

"The Green New Deal is probably the most fashionable policy in the English-speaking world. In Britain it is advocated by both Tory MPs and Jeremy Corbyn; while a non-partisan Canadian coalition of nearly 70 groups are backing such a scheme. However, it has been made flesh by US Democrats, in particular the political phenomenon in the US House of Representatives, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Ms Ocasio-Cortez has spelled out what a Green New Deal involves in a House resolution: rejecting economic orthodoxy to confront climate change. She ought to be congratulated twice over. At present the thinking is for governments to tackle global warming by including the social cost of carbon in the prices people pay, either through a carbon tax or a system of tradable carbon-emission permits. Such ideas have a role to play in changing the way societies consume and produce energy, but they are only moving us incrementally – if at all – towards sustainability. Global emissions of carbon dioxide are higher than they have ever been, almost three decades after the first global conference aimed at reducing them. The situation is becoming dangerous for human life. The latest figures show there is little more than a decade to save ourselves and the other creatures with whom we share the planet. To do so we must decouple economic activity from carbon emissions and ecological destruction.  This will not be easy. Economic power has become increasingly concentrated, giving rise to grotesque levels of inequality – both within and among countries. With financial speculation now a feature of capitalism, so are fraud and instability. Meanwhile, investment in public goods across the globe has stagnated. Growth increasingly relies on resource extraction, threatening civilisation itself. Ms Ocasio-Cortez’s plan recognises this and is rooted in making the economy both greener and more equitable. Her prospectus calls for a reduction in the inequality of income and wealth, essential given that the world’s richest 10% are responsible for half of carbon emissions. It sees large public spending to transform the US economy with an industrial base that would be net-zero in carbon emissions in a few decades. The plan is to create good job opportunities as the economy is made sustainably viable for the future. Critics claim such ideas are pie-in-the-sky and would require huge spending, sparking inflation or resulting in massive tax increases. Democratic leaders fret that it would make the party unelectable in conservative-leaning US states. Yet the issue is not the money to pay for the investments proposed. US government deficits are historically normal and often economically necessary. The constraint is what a nation can produce. As the economist Stephanie Kelton, who is advising Bernie Sanders, notes in her defence of the Green New Deal: “Inflation isn’t triggered by the amount of money the government creates but by the availability of biophysical resources that money tries to go out and buy.” Policymakers ought not wait for economic theory to catch up to real-world events. Ms Ocasio-Cortez rightly sees parallels with the response to the 1930s crisis where President Roosevelt dispensed with economic orthodoxy and tamed Big Finance. He created a New Deal jobs programme that employed millions, oversaw a massive expansion of government and remade the US industrial base. Humanity will run out of limited global resources long before the US runs out of dollars. Britain needs something like Ms Ocasio-Cortez’s Green New Deal. And we need it now – before it is too late."
"Heavy industry companies in Australia have been given the green light to increase their greenhouse gas emissions by nearly a third without penalty under the Coalition’s climate change policy. An analysis of a scheme known as the “safeguard mechanism”, part of the Coalition’s Direct Action policy, found the government regulator has approved a 32% increase in how much large industrial facilities are allowed to emit each year since the policy was introduced. While not every company emits up to their limit under the scheme, the most recent data, for 2017-18, shows emissions from large industry are up 12% since 2015. The increases have been signed off despite the safeguard mechanism having been promised to limit emissions from big polluters to ensure they do not just cancel out cuts paid for by taxpayers through the other half of Direct Action, the emissions reduction fund. The analysis by RepuTex, an energy and emissions research firm, found the increase in recorded emissions was set to wipe out the entire $2.55bn committed to pollution cuts over the past five years. Most of that has gone to restoring and protecting habitat and cutting pollution at landfill sites. “This is effectively money going down the drain,” RepuTex executive director Hugh Grossman said. Grossman said, though rarely discussed, the “safeguard mechanism” was Australia’s climate policy Achilles’ heel. He said it needed to be weighed alongside any cuts purchased through the emissions reduction fund, which the prime minister, Scott Morrison, has renamed a “climate solutions” fund. “In simple terms, Australia’s emission reduction target won’t be met until industrial emissions growth is constrained,” Grossman said. Industrial sites under the safeguard mechanism are the main driver of the continuing rise in Australia’s national emissions. The most recent government data shows emissions rose 0.9% in the year to September, a point Morrison has conceded during the campaign. Much of the increase is due to a 19.7% expansion of the liquified natural gas (LNG) industry, which is covered by the mechanism. The Coalition has changed how it describes the safeguard mechanism over time. In 2016, the then environment minister, Greg Hunt, said it would ensure emissions cuts contracted through the emissions reduction fund were not offset by significant increases above business-as-usual levels elsewhere in the economy. A government climate policy document released in February said the mechanism required Australia’s largest emitters to “measure, report and manage” their emissions, but did not say it would limit pollution. The government plans further changes to the scheme that are expected to allow more industrial sites to change their emissions limit. When the scheme began, most sites received limits, known as baselines, equivalent to their highest pollution level between 2009 and 2014. Companies that went beyond their baseline had to buy carbon credits to offset the breach. This has happened in a handful of cases. But companies could also apply to increase their baseline if their production levels were expected to rise or they had started operating more recently. About 100 companies have applied for a higher pollution limit, known as a “calculated baseline”. After consulting with industry, the government announced in March it would allow all companies to adopt a calculated baseline to “improve operation of the scheme, reduce costs for business and make it fairer and simpler”. Grossman said this was expected to lead to further emissions increases beyond those already approved. RepuTex found the combined baseline levels, or limits, of companies under the scheme had increased from 151m tonnes to 200m tonnes a year since the scheme was introduced, a 32% rise. Actual annual emissions from industrial sites under the scheme have increased from 139m tonnes to 155m tonnes since it was introduced, a 12% jump. RepuTex forecasts they will rise to 166m tonnes a year. It would lead to a total of 280m tonnes of extra emissions from Australian industry by 2030 – significantly more than the 193m tonnes of cuts that have signed up through the emissions reduction fund. Morrison has promised $2bn additional funding for the rebadged “climate solutions” fund if re-elected over 15 years. RepuTex found this could only offset the rise in industrial emissions – a situation the analysts describe as “running to stand still” – and not lead to a cut in national emissions as the government has promised. Labor says it would strengthen and expand the safeguard mechanism so polluters have to cut their combined emissions 45% by 2030 compared with 2005 levels. It promises to protect export industries from the full cost of emissions reductions. Many details of how it would transform the scheme remain unexplained. The government says Labor’s plans would hurt production and employment, while it will allow industry to grow. The progressive thinktank the Australia Institute produced broadly similar results to RepuTex in a separate analysis of the safeguard mechanism, finding it does almost nothing to limit emissions. Tom Swann, senior researcher with the institute, said LNG facilities were responsible for the largest breaches of emissions limits. Chevron’s Gorgon development in the Pilbara, site of a long promised but to date unsuccessful carbon capture and storage project, and Woodside’s North West Shelf project emitted 680,000 tonnes and 160,000 tonnes beyond their limits respectively. Heavy industry is responsible for about a quarter of Australia’s emissions. RepuTex expects it to pass electricity next year to become the biggest contributor to national pollution."
"Donald Trump’s reluctance to address climate change is set to cost his business empire millions of dollars in fines levied by New York City due to the amount of pollution emitted by Trump-owned buildings.  According to data shared with the Guardian, eight Trump properties in New York City do not comply with new regulations designed to slash greenhouse gas emissions. This means the Trump Organization is on track to be hit with fines of $2.1m every year from 2030, unless its buildings are made more environmentally friendly. According to city officials, the president’s eight largest New York properties pump out around 27,000 tons of planet-warming gases every ear, the equivalent of 5,800 cars. The buildings that exceed the new pollution thresholds include Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue, and the Trump Building on Wall Street. The biggest potential offender is Trump International Hotel & Tower, a 583ft skyscraper that looms over the south-west corner of Central Park. The building is on course to be fined $850,871 a year if no improvements are made to its energy efficiency. The New York mayor, Bill de Blasio, will hold a rally outside Trump Tower on Monday, seeking to highlight the looming penalties. “President Trump, you’re on notice,” de Blasio said. “Your polluting buildings are part of the problem. Cut your emissions or pay the price.” The fines are part of legislation passed by the city council in April that seeks to cut planet-warming emissions from the city’s largest buildings. All premises larger than 25,000ft – a total of 50,000 buildings – will be required to cut overall emissions 40% or face annual fines. The new standards, hailed by advocates as the toughest action by any city on climate change so far, takes aim at the biggest source of greenhouse gases in New York, where buildings account for more than two-thirds of emissions. Trump’s properties have long been identified as leading consumers of energy, although city officials say some other buildings are on track for even heavier fines. In order to comply with the new regulations, the Trump properties must improve insulation, upgrade window glass, replace boilers and better automate electricity use. “The good performers won’t have to pay any penalties but anything above the threshold has a lot of work to do now,” said Mark Chambers, director of the mayor’s office of sustainability. “It’s clear the president needs to pay attention to this, it’s a lot of money. “We will do what’s necessary to combat the climate crisis. It’s important we are all held responsible and President Trump is the No 1 roadblock globally to us responding to climate change.” New York has positioned itself as a bulwark against Trump administration attempts to dismantle action to address climate change. The city has vowed to divest its pension funds of fossil fuel investments and attempted to sue major oil companies for their role in the climate crisis. De Blasio has set a target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions 80% below 2005 levels by 2050. The new regulations on large buildings echo a central plank of the Green New Deal, a federal plan put forward by the New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez that calls for retrofitting all buildings for energy efficiency within 10 years. Ocasio-Cortez said: “Solving our current climate crisis will require leadership and bold ideas. New York City is providing both with its Green New Deal.” New York’s new climate regulations have been opposed by some developers who complain it will hamper the construction of large, dense buildings and deter energy-hungry tenants such as media and technology companies. The Trump Organization did not respond to a request for comment. According to the International Energy Agency, the construction and operation of buildings is responsible for more than a third of global energy consumption. Last year, a major United Nations report warned that the world must make an “unprecedented” effort to cut emissions by 45% by 2030 and then effectively to zero by 2050 to avoid the worst ravages of climate change, including severe heatwaves, flooding, ruinous storms and food insecurity."

Share this...FacebookTwitterI’m a little short on time and so today I will present the translation of the latest write-up at  Die kalte Sonne website, which discusses yet another recent study showing yet again that the sun plays a major role on climate.
Solar Activity Shows Precipitation In Maine Over the Last 7000 Years
By Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt
Geoscientist Jonathan Nichols and Yongsong Huang of Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, published just days ago  a new study in Geophysical Research Letters, which shows an impressive synchronocity between the development of precipitation and solar activity for the investigated area. The study is based on a 5-meter long sediment core extracted from a peat bog just off the coast of Maine. The layers of the core cover the climate history going back 6800 years. Nichols and Huang reconstructed the precipitation development in the region by using biomarkers and hydrogen isotopes, and then documented pronounced fluctuations where periods of drought alternated with wet periods. Moreover the two scientists discovered that the development of moisture was in sync with solar activity. Wet periods occurred during weak phases of solar activity. Especially the 210-year Suess/de Vries cycle could be seen in the precipitation patterns of the Maine peat bog (this is also discussed on pages 58-59 in “Die kalte Sonne”).
Also storm activity was in sync with this development. This was shown by the analysis of storm sediment layers from some New England lakes. Especially during the moist, inactive solar periods did storms occur with increasing frequency. Because of this, Nichols and Huang assume that the solar climate signal was intensified by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and/or the Arctic Oscillation (AO). More evidence of this is also provided by various European peat bog studies. Because of the reduction in solar activity now projected over the upcoming decades, the authors assume that precipitation over the US Northeast will rise and lead to more frequent flooding.
The study underscores the great importance of solar cycles on our climate – especially their impact on precipitation. Prominent examples of the sun’s impact on precipitation amounts are illustrated by the lake levels of the east African Lake Victoria, as well as the discharge rates from South America’s second largest river, the Parana (see p. 58 and 67 in “Die kalte Sonne”).”

Share this...FacebookTwitterI know some Danes are not going to like my tone here, but too bad. Why is it the government needs to tell you how to eat?Have you never learned?
As long as you full grown Danes are unable to feed yourselves, then you deserve all the ridicule the rest of the world can muster. How much more possibly incompetent can one get? This story is from T-Online. Hat-tip DirkH.
Denmark has become the first country in the world to tax fat in foods. According to the law, a fat tax of €2.15 per kilogram is now being levied.  The tax is designed to keep the people from eating too much unhealthy food (and to put more money into government coffers).
I ask myself just how incompetent and stupid must the Danes be to not know how to eat. Do they they really need the government to spoon-feed them? Have they been potty-trained yet? I wonder.
It’s coming to your country soon
We may joke about this, but it surely is coming to your country too. Note how the tax is all for our own protection. The Danes ought to throw this law back up.
According to reports, Danes are now rushing to the food markets and buying up fatty foods in bulk. T-Online quotes Sören Jörgensen:
‘We have to fill our stores with tons of butter and margerine in order to be able to serve our customers,’ said Sören Jörgensen Konzern Arla creamery.  Christian Jensen, manager of a supermarket in Copenhagen, spoke of a chaotic week: ‘There were many empty shelves. People have filled up their freezers.'”
Many don’t believe this will change eating habits. People will buy what they want to eat no matter the price. But it sure will transfer lots of money from the citizens to government coffers.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA new paper has been published by the Journal of Atmospheric and Solar Terrestrial Physics, authored by Nicola Scafetta, 2012: Testing an astronomically based decadal-scale empirical harmonic climate model versus the IPCC (2007) general circulation models. Entire paper available here.
Solar system (public domain graphic -NASA)
It’s not a secret that the IPCC models are all rigged to make CO2 look like the culprit for the last 150 years of warming. We say this because we now know their models completely ignore, or selectively distort, the potency of an array of drivers and amplification mechanisms.
In the paper, according to the abstract, Scafetta compares the performance of a recently proposed empirical climate model based on astronomical harmonics against all CMIP3 available general circulation climate models (GCM) used by the IPCC (2007) and finds that the climate appears to be resonating with, or is synchronized to, a set of natural harmonics that have been associated to the solar system planetary motion.
According to the abstract:
…the GCMs fail to reproduce the major decadal and multidecadal oscillations found in the global surface temperature record from 1850 to 2011. On the contrary, the proposed harmonic model (which herein uses cycles with 9.1, 10–10.5, 20–21, 60–62 year periods) is found to well reconstruct the observed climate oscillations from 1850 to 2011, and it is shown to be able to forecast the climate oscillations from 1950 to 2011 using the data covering the period 1850–1950, and vice versa.”
What does Scafetta conclude from this (emphasis added)?

We show that the IPCC GCM’s claim that all warming observed from 1970 to 2000 has been anthropogenically induced is erroneous because of the GCM failure in reconstructing the quasi 20-year and 60-year climatic cycles.”
In the conclusion of the paper, Scafetta also writes:

Consequently, the IPCC projections for the 21st century cannot be trusted.”

In light of this new information and all the new findings we’ve seen since 2007, the IPCC has no choice but to recognize and admit that their models are totally inadequate and in need of a complete overhaul.
Should the IPCC continue to ignore new findings and claim their models are accurate and correct (when they know they are not), then it will be de facto entering the territory of scientific fraud. The next assessment report, due in 2013 or 2014, must include the new scientific findings. Anything else would be willful fraud. That’s what it is when there’s intentional deception made for personal gain or to damage another individual.
There’s no way the IPCC will be able stick to its current climate models in its next report without opening themselves up to lawsuits for scientific fraud. No more excuses.

"The privilege of governing Australia obliges a political party, whatever its ideological leanings, to offer voters two things – coherent policies to deal with the biggest issues confronting the nation and a competent and prepared team to implement them. The climate emergency is the most pressing issue of our time. For decades, Australia has seen this existential crisis looming and has failed to act on it.  With just 12 years to limit the global climate catastrophe, citizens here and around the world are demanding governments stand up to vested interests and act. The UK parliament has declared a climate emergency, the idea of a Green New Deal is gaining traction in the US and beyond, and students around the world are engaging in spontaneous activism to force change. But in Australia the Coalition appears deaf to the rising clamour from the electorate. After tearing itself apart and dumping a prime minister to avoid implementing a functional climate plan, it clings to an obviously deficient emissions reduction target and has been forced back to Tony Abbott’s discredited climate policy because the hard right will countenance nothing else. That’s a policy that has seen Australia’s greenhouse emissions continue to rise for the past five years and that would put no constraint on continuing increases in the future. The idea that a major party should seriously propose we waste money for little result for another three years, when we have no more years to waste, is a shocking abrogation of responsibility. Scott Morrison’s dismissive response to a UN report finding that the world is sleepwalking towards an extinction crisis, and his parliamentary stunt of fondling a lump of coal, underline the contempt with which he seems to treat the electorate’s legitimate and rising concerns. The prime minister’s positive election pitch has boiled down to personal tax cuts, targeted at low- and middle-income earners in the short term, but offering an additional $230bn of tax relief to higher income earners over the next decade. The plan would improve the household budgets of many families but it would also make Australia’s tax system less progressive, reducing revenue so much that future governments’ capacity to offer services at their current standards would be constrained, and leeway to cope with global economic turbulence would be severely limited. The Coalition’s plan also leaves no room for spending that Guardian Australia believes is urgently needed if Australia is to be a fair and decent society, in particular an increase to the pitiful level of unemployment benefit – the main reason about 10% of us live below the poverty line even though we have enjoyed 28 years of uninterrupted economic growth. Mr Morrison has narrowed the contest with Labor in this campaign, but has carried the Coalition’s message almost as a one-man band, a solo act made necessary because the wounds of last year’s leadership coup are still open and the ideological divisions unresolved. Ministers hastily elevated to plug gaps caused by the rush of resignations after Malcolm Turnbull’s demise have shown scant command of their brief, and little interest in talking about the important portfolios they manage. And yet, to shut down an uncomfortable line of questioning in a campaign debate, Mr Morrison has promised that one of those most conspicuously “missing in action” – the environment minister, Melissa Price – will stay in the role if the Coalition is re-elected. In some important portfolios he did not appoint new ministers before the election was called, meaning announcements continue to be made in the name of ministers who are not even contesting. The task of government can never be a one-person undertaking, and voters have ample evidence to doubt the Coalition has a full team ready for the job. Alarmingly, Mr Morrison is also boosting the incoherent populism of Clive Palmer, apparently in the hope that the vote for his United Australia party, inflated by an estimated $50m in advertising, will push some conservative lower house candidates over the line, with the help of a Liberal/UAP preference deal. It may, and it may also put the Palmer party into the Senate. Mr Morrison implausibly insists Mr Palmer represents “no threat to the economy or national security”, despite UAP policies – where they can be deciphered – proposing hundreds of billions in extra spending and despite the erratic businessman’s rants about “communist China” planning a “clandestine takeover of Australia”. Given Mr Palmer’s chaotic behaviour when last in office, this short-term preference tactic could come at the cost of further voter disillusionment with the democratic system. The Coalition has neither credible policies nor a competent team, and Guardian Australia believes it has failed the test for re-election. Judged by the same standard, Labor presents voters with a convincing case. It has set a higher target for emissions reductions, closer to Australia’s fair share of the global climate response, and has a credible policy to achieve it – much of it borrowed from what Mr Turnbull wanted to implement. It will boost renewables, encourage electric car uptake and strengthen national environment laws. Its tax agenda is unashamedly progressive, with slightly more generous short-term tax cuts for low- and middle-income earners and a firm rejection of the Coalition’s bigger future cuts for workers higher up the income scales. Labor has had big-ticket tax policies on the table since the 2016 campaign, policy transparency that should be encouraged, despite the obvious political risks. Labor will reduce tax concessions for negative gearing, capital gains tax, superannuation and family trusts and has more recently announced the abolition of cash payouts from shareholder franking credits and a further crackdown on multinational tax avoidance. The revenue raised would be funnelled to social spending, on childcare, free dental care for pensioners, Medicare, schools and universities. Disappointingly, an increase in unemployment benefits is not on Labor’s list of concrete promises. Bill Shorten says he will review the payment in government, with a view to increasing it, but there is no provision for this expensive shift in the Labor leader’s costings. There is also an obvious fiscal risk in Labor’s plan. The Senate seems certain to block at least some of the tax changes, while the spending is likely to sail through. Labor may well need the higher budget surpluses it is promising to cover the difference. While Mr Shorten has failed to inspire voters, with net approval ratings still well in the negatives, he has approached the task of uniting and leading Labor with conscientious consideration, and the depth of experience and preparation on his front bench is clear. We have always considered Guardian Australia readers capable of making their own voting decisions, but in 2019 we urge readers to heed the fact that Labor is the only party with a credible climate policy and a chance of forming government after Saturday. For those with more a progressive leaning and a conviction Australia should work faster to reduce emissions, the Greens’ climate policy is more ambitious than Labor’s and its tax and spending policies more redistributive. Depending on the election outcome in the Senate, the Greens could work to toughen Labor’s stance. But the pre-election positioning by Shorten and the Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, will require careful judgment from climate-minded voters about whether the two left-of-centre parties are preparing to rerun the climate negotiations of 2009 or of 2010. Senator Di Natale has said he wants a “seat at the table”, as the Greens had with Julia Gillard to develop the carbon price in 2010. But he has also declared he is prepared to vote down a Labor climate plan that “locks in” insufficient ambition, as the Greens did to Kevin Rudd’s carbon pollution reduction scheme in 2009. Shorten insists he will have a mandate to implement the policy he is taking to the poll but his success will almost certainly depend on the Senate negotiation. For more conservative voters who cannot stomach the Coalition’s wilful inaction on climate change, or who want to cast a vote against Liberal MPs who have worked hardest to prevent responsible policy, such as Mr Abbott, there are in many seats credible independent candidates who could make positive contributions in the parliament. Their success could also finally weaken the sway of climate sceptics within the Coalition. We believe the Coalition’s indefensible attitude to climate change, its wafer-thin policy offering and the fact that it has not resolved the internal divisions that blighted its term in office mean it has forfeited the right to voters’ trust. However you choose to exercise your democratic decision-making on Saturday, please consider your candidate’s position on climate and the rapidly shrinking timeframe for action. We have endured mindless scare campaigns and half-baked policy for too many decades. We don’t have three more years to waste."

Share this...FacebookTwitterDr. Brown and Climate Ethics
By Ed Caryl
Donald A. Brown at Penn State writing in his blog here did the “Climate Skeptics” a big favor by gathering “The Hockey-Stick Team’s” arguments into one article. I am sure that Professor Brown was certain that no skeptic would have the temerity to actually challenge his assertions.
But his assertions beg for challenge. One of his techniques is to make claims about the skeptic side that are in fact much more true for the Team side. These techniques include:
Lying
One example of the Team’s use of lying is the assertion that “97% of Climate Scientists agree” that AGW is true. This figure is based on an on-line poll sent to over 10,000 “earth scientists” where the participants were self selected, and the actual numbers were 75 out of 79 answering the poll describing themselves as “peer-reviewed climate scientists”. See here. The actual questions on that poll were:
1. When compared with pre-1800s levels, do you think that mean global temperatures have generally risen, fallen, or remained relatively constant?
2. Do you think human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures?”
Nearly all skeptics would answer “have generally risen” to Question 1, and most would answer “yes” to Question 2. This loaded poll proves nothing. The whole argument revolves around “how much”. We don’t know if the above 79 participants were actually “climate scientists” or not. They could just as well have been kids down at the neighborhood Starbucks with laptops. But this assertion has been repeated countless times on the Internet as if it were Holy Writ and Peer Reviewed. (It was not.) The principle used here is that “If you repeat a lie often enough, it becomes the truth”. this according to one of history’s most infamous propagandist.
Professor Brown says that:
Some of the claims made by some of those engaged in the disinformation campaign have been outright lies about such things as the claim that the entire scientific basis for human-induced climate change is a hoax or that there is no evidence of human causation of climate change.”
This statement itself is not true. Most skeptics think that there is some human causation, just not the catastrophic kind claimed by the Team. In answer to Professor Brown’s citation of six books for his side, here’s my citation of six books for the skeptic’s side:
1.  Evidence Based Climate Science, Dr. Don Easterbrook
2.  The Hockey Stick Illusion, A. W. Montford
3.  Climategate, The CRUtape Letters, Steven Mosher and Thomas W. Fuller
4.  The Great Global Warming Blunder, Dr. Roy W. Spencer
5. The Shattered Consensus: The True State of Global Warming, Patrick J.Michaels (Editor), Dr. Sallie L. Baliunas, Dr. Robert C. Balling Jr , Dr. Randall S. Cerveny, Dr. John Christy, Dr. Robert E. Davis, Dr. Oliver W. Frauenfeld, Dr. Ross McKitrick, Dr. Patrick J. Michaels, Dr. Eric S. Posmentier, Dr. Willie Soon (Contributors)
6. Die Kalte Sonne, (The Cold Sun, Why the Climate Catastrophe is Not Taking Place) Dr. Fritz Vahrenholt and Dr. Sebastian Luñing (In Press) For more on this one, read here
Focusing On An Unknown While Ignoring the Known.
The amount of the unknown on climate science is far greater than what is known, and thus impacts the known at every level. For example: although climate sensitivity, (the temperature rise due to CO2 doubling) has yet to be established, a number is used in all the general climate models. The IPCC “consensus” is that it is somewhere between 1.5°C to 4.5°C (IPCC, 2007, pp.798-799). Where do those numbers come from? They come from guesses by Michael Mann and Syukuro Manabe.
Here is the story (from Wikipedia):
The standard modern estimate of climate sensitivity – 3 °C, plus or minus 1.5 °C – originates with a committee on anthropogenic global warming convened in 1979 by the National Academy of Sciences and chaired by Jule Charney. Only two sets of models were available; one, due to Syukuro Manabe, exhibited a climate sensitivity of 2 °C, the other, due to James E. Hansen, exhibited a climate sensitivity of 4 °C. “According to Manabe, Charney chose 0.5 °C as a not-unreasonable margin of error, subtracted it from Manabe’s number, and added it to Hansen’s. Thus was born the 1.5 °C-to-4.5 °C range of likely climate sensitivity that has appeared in every greenhouse assessment since…”[16]
Many people have tried to develop more accurate estimates. The current range is anything from zero to 10°C, though the latter number is usually dismissed. As time goes by, the number seems to be dropping. Recent ice-age studies don’t change the old estimates by very much, but give a median value of 2.3°C. Even more recently, there have been efforts to calculate climate sensitivity from thermodynamic principals. Find the papers here, here, and here. These all suggest that the climate sensitivity is zero. Measurements from above the atmosphere all suggest that climate sensitivity is less than 0.6°C. See here, here, and here.
Specious Claims of Bad Science
In Dr. Brown’s paragraph here he cites no specific examples; this is a general childish name-calling type of attack. This list is offered as a rebuttal. Tom Nelson offers 250 examples of bad science, or scientists behaving badly, gleened from the Climategate 2 emails in the Team’s own words.
Creation of Front Groups
Both sides have created “front groups”. What is the IPCC, if not a “front group”? The Center for American Progress is a front group. This is a label intended to denigrate. For the figures on money spent by organizations on both sides see here. A summary is quoted:
Figure 1.1, I compare the spending of climate action opponents and advocates.  As the figure displays, the combined program spending of environmental organizations ($1.4 billion) is almost twice as much as the combined program spending of conservative organizations and industry associations ($787 million).  Specific to climate change and energy-related activities, environmental groups appear to have outspent conservative groups and their industry association allies $394 million to $259 million.”

From Brown’s point of view, any skeptic will have questionable credentials. That’s part of the Team’s tactics to denigrate and marginalize any skeptic. There is a problem though. One of the better-known lists is the Oregon Petition. It currently has 31,487 signatories, over 9,000 of those with PhDs. Contrast this with the poll cited above with 75 anonymous positive poll responders. Also keep in mind that “The Team” has less than 50 people as core members. The Oregon Petition is simply too large to be dismissed. In the end, it only takes a single skeptic scientist.
PR Campaigns to Convince the Public There’s No Scientific Basis
Both sides have used PR firms. This is what you do when billions of dollars are at stake. The University of East Anglia used (and is still using) the BBC to convince the public of the opposite. What larger PR firm could they have used? It is very difficult for skeptics to match these large megaphones. That’s why so many are blogging.
Astroturf Groups
This is right out of the Nancy Pelosi playbook. I’m surprised he used the term. Notice that none are named. It is another dubious attempt to denigrate. His use of the terms “disinformation campaign” is also a handy term for denigration. Without investigation, anything written by a skeptic automatically gets labeled as disinformation, and any conversation between three or more skeptics will be labeled as an Astroturf Group. For Dr. Brown’s information, I am myself a group of one, funded by Social Security.
Cyber-Bullying Scientists and Journalists
Both of these groups have made themselves public figures. James Hansen, for just one example, delights in getting himself arrested on camera in front of the White House. Michael Mann regularly appears on TV talk-shows and news programs making claims that beg a response. When public scientists step outside of the peer-reviewed scientific literature, they are asking for trouble. When their public claims are demonstrably not true, they must be refuted. Here is a link to predictions made in the 1980’s by James Hansen.
Dr. Brown then gives skeptics some advice:
A few things we are not saying. We are not against skepticism in [sic] but skeptics must play by certain rules of science. That is skeptics should:
a) Publish conclusions in peer-reviewed literature.
b. Stop claiming that anything that is not fully proven is bad science.
c. Not lie about or overstate their scientific conclusions.
d. Not cherry-pick scientific evidence by focusing on what is not known while ignoring what is known.
e. Not repeat scientific arguments that have been fully refuted.
f. Publicly condemn cyber-bullying of journalists and scientists.”
For no. a, Dr. Brown may not realize that peer review has been tightly controlled by the Team. It has been difficult, and in some cases impossible, to get papers published in certain journals with conclusions that the Team does not approve, whether or not those conclusions are scientifically valid. Some discussion of the problem here, here, here, and here.
For no. b: “Stop claiming that anything not fully proven is bad science.” For it to be good science, define “fully”. As Einstein said, “No amount of experimentation can ever prove me right; a single experiment can prove me wrong.” The skeptic effort must be encouraged; the alternative is totalitarianism.
As for no. c, lies are easily detected. No skeptic knowingly lies. It is too easily found out. This statement is just another bogus denigration attempt.
No. d: “Not cherry-pick scientific evidence by focusing on what is not known…” This is a strange statement. All scientists focus on the unknown… and should. Only by focusing on the unknown can anything new be learned. New knowledge can overturn what we thought we knew. See Einstein, above.
No. e: “Not repeat scientific arguments that have been fully refuted.” See Einstein, above.
No. f: “Publicly condemn…” This cuts both ways. Stop condemning (cyber-bullying) skeptics. Also stop characterizing any critique of public statements by the Team as cyber-bullying. It all takes place in cyber-space as a matter of course. This is just another attempt to limit free-speech and discourse.
Calling this discourse an ethics problem is suspicious. I would ask Dr Brown to examine his own ethics in writing his piece. Who or what is he trying to protect? Both sides think they are saving the earth. Both sides have their extremists. Neither side has a lock on “the truth”.
Part of the problem is that the public loves a disaster, particularly the media, and the Team has played on that for political and funding reasons. If they are proved alarmist, the money dries up instantly.  Here is the first blog article this author wrote on the  subject. (Chicken Little was a Calamitologist.)

SkySails kite-towing technology fails to deliver. (Photo: SkySails)

The German FAZ reports here that Hamburg-based SkySails will lay off half of its workers. Managing director Stephan Wrage, an industrial engineer, blames reluctance by shipping companies to invest in his “innovative technology”. The FAZ also adds:
 There’s no support from the banks. He expects the difficult situation to continue for another 1 to 2 years.”
I can’t understand the lack of interest. Maybe it has something to do with high costs and low benefits? Damn customers – always expecting performance for their money.
What the company has to do now is ask the government to pass a law requiring ships be outfitted with towing kites. You see, the shipping companies are too stupid to recognize the benefits of this “innovative technology”. They need the government to decide it for them. After all, according to the company’s website, “40 employees representing a wide range of disciplines and specialties – from aerospace engineers, to software developers, shipbuilders, management professionals and CNC operators – all help to develop, manufacture and market the worldwide patented SkySails technology.” They can’t be all wrong, can they?
The company, established in 2001, also boasts:
SkySails kites are the key technology for capturing the vast potential of high-altitude winds, and SkySails is the first company in the world that has succeeded in developing towing-kite technology into an industrial application. […] Some 50 million euros have been invested in developing the SkySails technology and establishing the manufacturing capability.
50 million euros! And high altitude? Since when do ships fly? And they claim they have succeeded?

SkySails won many awards
There are also promotional videos for the award-winning company’s products at its website. One shows how the huge kite is deployed (to high altitudes). It requires that the ship be outfitted with a giant crane for hoisting the large kite into the air before releasing it. The crane itself has got to cost a fortune.
I majored in mechanical engineering, and only a couple hours of simple calculations would tell anyone that this technology makes no sense. I’m beginning to wonder what German engineering students are being taught at their universities.
The FAZ also writes:
The shipping companies are hesitant to invest a million euros for a towing kite. So far SkySails has sold about 10 towing kites, but not all have been installed.”
A million euros! Ten kites – in 11 years.
My advice to the management is that they speak to an old engineer, the kind that still uses a slide rule and was never brainwashed by green religion, and listen to what he says. If he says ha ha ha – it means the idea won’t work, and start designing a better diesel engine instead.
I’m sure there were a number of politicians who made the obligatory tour of the “innovative” plant, followed by a speech on how this was the “future of energy” – blah blah blah. Fritz Vahrenholt’s and Sebastian Lünings’s book “Die kalte Sonne” did not hit the bookstores a minute too soon.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s a great story at the English Der Spiegel that you’ll never, ever see or hear from the other drugged-up-on-green German media. It’s about how the drugged-up-on-green government assures failure – this one with potentially catastrophic proportions for Germany. Let it be a lesson for other countries.
Read about the entire bloody mess at:Germany’s Wind Power Revolution in the Doldrums.
Is Germany's renewable energy supply on the verge causing the entire system to crash and burn?
With its nuclear power reactors in the process of being shut down by government decree (done in a hysterical state of mind in the wake of Fukushima), Germany now needs to find an alternative supply for electricity, and real soon. The answer was to build huge offshore wind parks in the windy North Sea, for example like the one now being completed by energy giant RWE. However,
…when work is completed on the Nordsee Ost wind farm, some 30 kilometers (19 miles) north of the island of Helgoland in the North Sea, the sea air will be filled with a strong smell of fumes: diesel fumes. The reason is as simple as it is surprising. The wind farm operator, German utility RWE, has to keep the sensitive equipment — the drives, hubs and rotor blades — in constant motion, and for now that requires diesel-powered generators. Because although the wind farm will soon be ready to generate electricity, it won’t be able to start doing so because of a lack of infrastructure to transport the electricity to the mainland and feed it into the grid. The necessary connections and cabling won’t be ready on time and the delay could last up to a year.”
In other words, before Germany can launch itself into the renewable energy era Environment Minister Norbert Röttgen so frequently hails, the country must first burn massive amounts of fossil fuels out in the middle of the North Sea — a paradox as the country embarks on its energy revolution.”
Read more at: Germany’s Wind Power Revolution in the Doldrums.
Wonderful government management: Multi-billion euro windparks are going to just sit there and literally make the wind blow. It gets worse, read on. Other quotes:
So far 86 applications have been submitted for North Sea wind farms, though just 24 have been approved — and only four are in operation.”
RWE’s managers warn that even the more modest target for 2020 could be “missed by miles.”

Because of the weather conditions, engineers could only carry out much of the work between May and September.”
Without a grid to plug into, the turbines can’t deliver any electricity to the mainland. And without the sale of “green” power, the multi billion-euro wind farms won’t be generating revenues any time soon.”
RWE alone could lose more than a hundred million euros.”
…private investors now have doubts once more.”
The delays on the high seas are a bitter blow for the German government’s…”
Got to feel bad for the energy power companies – ordered by politicians to do the virtually impossible.
Germany’s power system was once tops in the world. Now that the government elephant has been allowed to run wild through the china shop, the risk of a complete collapse is real.

"Another week, another report lamenting the decimation of wildlife and the threat of natural collapse. The UN tome was so gloomy it needed 1,800 pages to spell out the message: 1 million species face extinction if we carry on like this.  So what is to be done? The OECD has suggested that punitive taxes are the only way to discourage a rapacious approach to natural resources. But Upside readers have also been in touch advocating a shift of course away from growth at all costs and towards something more sustainable. Maria Smith suggested it was time to explore in greater depth whether we could escape the pursuit of endless economic growth. We are all familiar with the damaging impact that the pursuit of financial wealth has on society, culture and the environment. We need no reminding of this planet’s dangerous rate of warming or its peoples’ divide between those with too much and those without enough. Yet the supremacy of economic growth as an indicator of progress is still sought after by governments all over the world. As climate change has now begun to bite, the link between economic growth and environmental decline needs to be more thoroughly understood and accepted. With this in mind, it would be great to hear from you: do we have to expand our economies indefinitely? How would we wean ourselves off growth? Are there models for how this would work? What would be the pitfalls, and how to mitigate them?

I’ve been swimming in the sea off Hove for over a year and have not had a cold or infection in that time. I turn 65 in a couple of weeks and suggest, if you haven’t already done so, you consider researching the benefits of strength training for all ages. John Nugent, via email I really enjoyed Jonny Weeks’ article & I thought you might be interested in how cold-water swimming has been instrumental in the recovery from severe depression of my swimming friend, Katie Maggs. A short award winning documentary has been made about Katie’s recovery – https://youtu.be/lvViuv0vIKU – & she has since been on a mission to help others who might now be suffering as she was.

"The recent shocking UN report on the threatened extinction of one million species has focused global attention on the crucial role of biodiversity in the health of the planet. Almost exactly 30 years ago, the first warning sounded that amphibian species were already in potentially catastrophic freefall. Tim Halliday, who has died aged 73, was one of the leading figures in a worldwide initiative to raise the alarm, and to understand the reasons for the decline. The current chief scientist of the Amphibian Survival Alliance, Phil Bishop, called him “the leading champion and ambassador for all things amphibian”. In 1989 Halliday was one of the prime movers in organising the First World Congress of Herpetology (herpetology is the study of amphibians and reptiles) at the University of Kent, Canterbury. While studying the courtship and mating of British newts in the wild, he had noticed over the years that the numbers in his study ponds had been falling. As participants at the congress compared notes, they realised that the same was happening all over the world. Many of these declines were described as “enigmatic”, because frogs, toads, newts and salamanders were dying in supposedly protected habitats.  Following the congress, Halliday and others set up the Declining Amphibian Populations Task Force, of which he was international director from 1994 until 2006, under the auspices of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. The key task was to record numbers of individuals of different species in locations all around the world, to collate the population data with environmental information, and to highlight those species under threat of extinction. Halliday launched a journal, FrogLog, to share the data, and through a programme of small grants sent young biologists all over the world to find amphibians and record how they were doing. The number of known species has almost doubled since the project began, but the data showed that around one in three was at risk of extinction, more than any other kind of animal. Halliday and his colleagues concluded that amphibians were peculiarly vulnerable because they live both on land and in water. Human activity, leading to habitat loss, pollution and climate change, takes its toll, as does widespread infection by the chytrid fungus. In his darker moments, Halliday described himself as an “extinction biologist” rather than a conservationist, documenting species that would soon no longer exist. He was delighted, however, when Sri Lankan scientists named a new discovery after him: Pseudophilautus hallidayi, or Halliday’s shrub frog. He made a point of going to visit it in its natural habitat, a deep, wooded ravine near Kandy. Halliday was born in Marlborough, Wiltshire. His father, Jack Halliday, taught biology at Marlborough college, and his mother, Edna (nee Barlow), was a housemistress there. Tim attended the school and his passion for wildlife began with collecting leeches in the neighbouring water meadows, wondering at their astonishing diversity. The school also furnished him with a large, hardbacked book of cartridge paper in which to make biological drawings: thereafter he would combine his skills as a draughtsman with scientific inquiry. He studied zoology at Oxford University, and pursued a doctorate on the sexual behaviour of newts in the university’s Animal Behaviour Research Group. The group had been founded by the pioneering ethologist Niko Tinbergen, and provided the starting point for the careers of many others including Desmond Morris, Aubrey Manning and Richard Dawkins. Halliday became known for his summary figure of the smooth newt courtship sequence, reproduced in several textbooks that were beginning to embrace the quantitative approach to behaviour pioneered by the Tinbergen school. In 1977 he was appointed as a lecturer in biology at the Open University, concluding his career there as professor of biology in 2009. He wrote numerous courses on comparative and evolutionary biology and neuroscience, and maintained a busy programme of fundamental research alongside his conservation work. He served on the council of the Zoological Society of London from 1990 until 1998, and chaired its committee on conservation: he called this his “suit and tie” period, being more usually seen in T-shirt and red Kickers. His public communication role included advising the BBC on David Attenborough’s programmes Life on Earth and Life in Cold Blood, and he published a popular handbook on frogs in 2016. Just before Christmas 2016 Halliday’s GP, an old friend, diagnosed him with cancer. It turned out to be a rare and fatal lymphoma. In the years that remained to him, Halliday returned with renewed vigour to his work as a wildlife illustrator, raising thousands of pounds for lymphoma research through an exhibition of his paintings of brilliantly coloured amphibians and birds in September 2018. In 1970 Halliday married Carolyn Wheeler. The daughter of a GP in Marlborough, Carolyn had been the first girl to attend Marlborough college, and had also studied zoology at Oxford – though Halliday had first met her at nursery school. She and their children, Sam, Jo and Alice, survive him, as do two grandchildren. • Timothy Richard Halliday, biologist, born 11 September 1945; died 10 April 2019"

 By Ed Caryl
GISS and the GHCN are preoccupied with the Arctic, bestowing large “corrections” on the few and far northern stations. The raw data of the Arctic did not tell the story they wanted to hear, and so GISS took it upon themselves to rewrite it.
Let’s start with Figure 1 from Paul Homewood’s article How GISS has totally Corrupted Reykjavik’s Temperature, used by permission.

Figure 1: Corrupted Reykjavik’s temperature
In January of this year, Paul Homewood of Not A Lot of People Know That, wrote an article describing GHCN and GISS changes to the temperature data that resulted in early 20th century cooling in Reykjavik, Iceland. Because I had stored many annual temperature records for Arctic stations in preparing A Light In Siberia in September of 2010, this prompted an investigation into whether GHCN and GISS had pulled the same on other station data. The short answer…yes they had!
Last year in May, GHCN did a major revision of their historical temperature database. They changed the title of the database to GHCN-M version 3. GISS followed. They refer to the new data as GHCN_v3. The important thing to note is that GHCN_v3 already contains homogeneity “corrections” so there is in most cases now, no difference between
GISS “raw” data (after removing suspicious records), and “after GISS homogeneity adjustments.” As a result, we only get to see temperature data that has already been modified by the hand of man (or a computer under the direction of a man).
What has this done to temperatures? You get one guess.

Figure 2. This is a GHCN comparison of database version 2 and version 3. Land and Ocean Temperatures for January. Source: NOAA/GHCN here.
The chart is subtle in that the scale is chosen to hide the slope and amount of the change trend. But look closely. Note that the change trend is from cooler in the past to warmer in the present, even though the temperature trend is already in that direction. They just added another ~0.1°C to the century trend.
What did they do in the Arctic? Above the Arctic Circle, there are few weather stations.

Figure 3. This is the last ten years temperature trend. From GISS.
The red Arctic grids on the anomaly maps represent ten stations, most in Arctic Russia. It is a bit difficult to sort out specifically which stations these are. Eleven stations in or close to these locations were investigated. Many have quite large “corrections.” Ostrov Dixon is the red grid square on the left on the north coast of Russia. Barrow is the orange grid square at the top of Alaska. Figure 4 is the first example.

Figure 4. This is the temperature change and change amounts to the Ostrov Dixon (Dickson Island) station.
The mainstream climate scientists have always disliked the warming in the 1920’s, 30’s, and 40’s, and the cooling in the 1960’s and 70’s. At several locations in the Arctic they have sought to “correct” these years.

Figure 5. Ostrov Kotel (Kettle Island)

At Ostrov Kotel they simply warmed the whole series from just before 1950 to 1995 With obvious steps at each end of the change. At Barrow, (Figure 6) the change was a series of ramps. This makes little sense at Barrow. For all its history the measuring site has been at the airport. Barrow has a well-documented heat island, but the correction is in the wrong direction for that. Again, the correction takes away most of the 1960’s, 70’s, and 80’s cooling.

Figure 6. This is the temperature change at Barrow.
At most locations they were not so obvious. For 11 locations that seem to be the heart of the warm grids, here are the plots.

Figure 7. The GHCN/GISS corrections at 11 Arctic locations.
It is very difficult to see a pattern in Figure 7. Some stations have a wild pattern of corrections of several degrees. Some have just a few spikes here and there. Some have a definite pattern.

Figure 8. This is the average “correction” of all the stations in Figure 7 with a linear trend line.
Figure 8 shows the pattern: cooling of the distant past, and warming of the inconvenient 60’s and 70’s.
Figure 9 below shows the average anomaly for those 11 stations:

Figure 9. This is the average anomaly for the 11 stations before and after GHCN “corrections”, with trend lines.
In Figure 9, the “corrections” have doubled the warming trend from 0.7°C per century to 1.4°C per century. The pesky warming in the 20’s and 30’s, and the cooling of the 60’s and 70’s are now nearly on the same level, almost wiping out that inconvenient AMO cycle.
I had data from a dozen other Arctic and Northern Siberian stations from last year. Most of those had just a few minor changes. Here (Figure 10) is the average correction for all 23 stations. As one gets further from the extreme Arctic, the changes begin to average out. If all stations around the globe are included, the average becomes that slow warming “correction” seen in Figure 2.

Figure 10. This is the average of 23 Arctic stations.
GHCN seems preoccupied with the Arctic, bestowing large “corrections” on the few far northern stations. This is in line with the “climate scientists” belief system:

The Arctic is warming faster than the rest of the globe.
Ocean cycles have little effect on the climate.
The present decade is the warmest.
CO2 rules.

This confirmation bias gets reflected in every evaluation step when reviewing temperature records. The result is that each new data release further confirms what they look for. Can we trust the GHCN and GISS temperature data? You be the judge.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMany people view environmentalist groups as friendly folks who only want to protect nature. The reality, however, is that many are very powerful, intolerant, and have the means to bully, intimidate, and criminalize people just for having a different opinion.Take for example Hubert Weiger of the powerful German environmental group BUND (Bund für Natur Deutschland). At eco-website Klimaretter (Climate Rescuer) here, Weiger fumes at Canada and wants the UN to start a legal process because the country backed out of the completely useless Kyoto treaty. Klimaretter writes:
In 2012, the United Nations should introduce a breach of contract process against Canada because the country backed out of the Kyoto contract. This is what the Chairman of the environmental association BUND, Hubert Weiger demands. ‘Also the German government must apply pressure,’ said Weiger in a interview with klimaretter.info.”
Still not clear to you? Well you listen, and you listen good! Klimaretter continues:
‘The community of nations cannot stand by and simply let a country throw this kind of crucial human rights binding contract into the dustbin,’ he believes.”
There are plenty of German eco-kooks within the government, and so Canada ought not take these threats too lightly. Canada can reckon with a massive smear campaign from the intolerant environmentalists in Europe. Weiger then adds:
“Not only did Germany reach its targets without any problems, but also did so reaping economic benefits. Climate protection is a central innovation driver for the economy and creates considerably more jobs than it destroys.”
In addition to scientific papers, Herr Weiger also obviously hasn’t been reading the financial papers. The reality is quite to the contrary. Germany’s energy sector is nearing a meltdown of unprecedented dimensions (soon to appear in English). This year the country went from being a major net exporter to a major net importer of energy. Germany’s solar companies are drowning in red ink and teetering on the brink of bankruptcy. Moreover, conventional power companies have announced the sackings of thousands of well-paid workers. Also read here, Green Economy 2011 in a Nosedive.

And in the wake of Fukushima, Germany elected to wipe out an entire industry in which it was a global leader when it came to safety and innovation: nuclear power. For some, the shutdown of nuclear plants can’t come soon enough. Klimaretter writes:
Weiger is demanding that the nuclear exit be moved up to 2012 or 2013.”
Shutting down all of Germany’s nuclear reactors might be tough to explain to the public. No problem though, Weigner has a solution for that too:
What we need is a ‘comprehensive information and motivation campaign, beginning with kindergarten and extending through to seniors, on TV, radio, Internet at all levels – from the federal government on through to the municipalities and local communities.”
Talk about scary. Sounds like something from the old playbooks of authoritarian regimes. It wouldn’t be scary if this was just from an obscure green kook from a fringe organization. But these are the recommendations of an organization that is widely quoted by the media daily and is well-connected to Germany’s top government levels.
Canada, beware! They hate you because you have a different opinion and you refuse to fall to your knees before them. And you’ve been making too many plans for your damn dirty tar sands.
One final note: One of the main contributors to Klimaretter is centre-left SPD honcho Michael Müller. I can only surmise that he condones this type of highly intrusive, authoritarian-style of global and local interference.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA new paper titled High-resolution sea surface reconstructions off Cape Hatteras over the last 10 ka appearing just recently in the AGU Paleoceanography Journal authored by Caroline Cléroux et al provides further, clear evidence of a major solar impact on climate during the Holocene. Hat/tip: http://kaltesonne.de/.
According to the paper’s abstract, the study presents high-resolution foraminiferal-based sea surface temperature, sea surface salinity and upper water column stratification reconstructions off Cape Hatteras, a region sensitive to atmospheric and thermohaline circulation changes associated with the Gulf Stream.
Now if I recall correctly, this was the region that Stefan Rahmstorf deemed not long ago as good enough to be used to represent sea level trend for the whole world.
The above authors focused on the last 10,000 years to study the surface hydrology changes under our current climate conditions and looked at centennial to millennial time scale variability. To do this, a seabed core was extracted off the coast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina at a water depth of 620 m.
They observed opposite evolutions between the conditions off Cape Hatteras and those south of Iceland, known today for the North Atlantic Oscillation pattern. Around 8.3 ka and 5.2–3.5 ka, they reconstructed positive salinity anomalies off Cape Hatteras. For the 5.2–3.5 ka period they demonstrated that the salinity increase was caused by the cessation of the low salinity surface flow coming from the north.
What’s behind the anomalies? They found that variations were in sync with total solar irradiance. The abstract states (emphasis added):
Wavelet transform analysis revealed a 1000-year period pacing the d18O signal over the early Holocene. This 1000-year frequency band is significantly coherent with the 1000-year frequency band of Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) between 9.5 ka and 7 ka and both signals are in phase over the rest of the studied period.”
The paper’s introduction has a few sentences that the IPCC really needs to take note of (emphasis added):

The last decade of paleoclimate research has shown that the Holocene is not the stable, climatic event-free period as previously thought: both external and internal (oceanic) forcings have caused major climatic changes. […] On a shorter time scale, observations over about the last 50 years show interannual and decadal climate change. These fluctuations probably persisted throughout the Holocene, together with centennial to millennial variability.”
Dr. Sebastian Lüning writes at the Die kalte Sonne site:
The new findings once again clearly underscore that the last several thousands of years are characterized by natural temperature cycles that are controlled by fluctuations in solar activity (see p. 68-75 in ‘Die kalte Sonne’). The logical continuation of these natural cycles through today shows that an important part of the warming of the last 150 years has to be attributed to the increase in solar activity. It is not a mere coincidence that the last decades have been the most solar active of the last 10,000 years.
The climate models used by the IPCC are not able to reproduce these millennial cycles because they assign only a very small climate impact to the sun. Also the recently introduced new climate model from the Max Planck Institute in Hamburg suffers from the same deficiency, and thus the results of that model are essentially unrealistic.”
In layman’s terms: crap in, crap out.
Once again yet another study that emphatically shows that climate changed in the recent past (while CO2 was stable), and that these changes were in sync with solar activity. We’ve said it a thousand times before, and we’ll probably have to say it another thousand times:

"Larry Turner doesn’t expect to be back. “We’re going to lose our town,” he said as he hosed down what little he was able to rescue from his 95-year-old mother’s house after weeks underwater in the small Iowa community of Pacific Junction. “I’ve been here 68 years and this is the worst I’ve ever seen. Every home got destroyed.”  Pacific Junction’s 470 residents were forced to flee in mid-March after a surge of water hit the Missouri river and busted through levees the length of Iowa to create the region’s biggest floods in living memory. The breach that wrecked the town occurred a few miles to the north. Within hours, surrounding farmland disappeared under an inland sea and Pacific Junction was drowned by 15 feet of water. It was a month before most residents could get back into their homes and no one has returned permanently because their houses are uninhabitable. Pacific Junction’s streets are still piled high with remnants of furniture, washing machines and toys. Officials went through the town tagging which homes might be salvaged and which are doomed. Some residents have marked houses “For sale. As is” but it is difficult to imagine who would buy.  Turner worked in construction for most of his life and judged that the water damage was too great to save either his mother’s house or his own. “My place is five blocks from here. I got a brother lives here in town. He got flooded out. My sister lives here in town. She got flooded out,” he said.  Besides the cost of rebuilding, Turner has another factor to consider when deciding whether to return to the town he has lived in since birth. The surge in water was driven by rapidly melting snows to the north and the “bomb cyclone” late winter storm that dumped huge amounts of rain on the region. Coming after years of intensifying rains, storms and drought increasingly attributed to climate change, Turner wonders if there’s even a future for towns like Pacific Junction without addressing the dramatic shifts in the weather. It’s a question being pondered by communities and farmers across the Midwest. America’s two great rivers book-end Iowa. The Missouri runs along the state’s western border and the Mississippi marks its eastern boundary. Both have set record floods in recent weeks. In the west of the state, Pacific Junction’s trauma is shared the length of the Missouri in Iowa and beyond as the huge flow of water breached one levee after another, turning the meandering river into a series of lakes, swamping farms, closing an interstate highway and washing though towns. Three hundred miles to the east, the city of Davenport is grappling with more than 50 days of flooding after the Mississippi spilled over its banks, broke through a barrier and washed into downtown. The streets of smaller cities to the south, such as Buffalo, were underwater for days. Democratic presidential candidates have descended on flood-battered communities on both rivers. Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar and Beto O’Rourke were among those campaigning in Iowa who directly linked the floods to climate change. That’s a politically sensitive topic in a state where three-quarters of registered Republicans regard climate change as only a “minor” or “no real threat”. But the flooding, and its duration as well as scale, have focussed attention on long-term planning to deal with the impact of changing weather patterns even among those who question their cause. In Davenport, a city of 103,000 on the border with Illinois, the flooding has prompted renewed debate about how best to prepare for what is widely assumed to be more regular and sustained surges on the Mississippi. “Between hurricanes, tornadoes, floods and droughts, literally all within a year, something’s changing,” said Davenport’s mayor, Frank Klipsch. “I think we would be irresponsible if we don’t address that.” Davenport has for years deployed a portable barrier to contain overflow from the river in an area of waterside parkland that serves as a flood plain. But the city was hit with a huge surge in the Mississippi this year and the water has stayed around for longer than at any time on record. After six weeks, a section of the barrier collapsed and water rushed into parts of downtown, flooding businesses. Klipsch said the old response would have been to build a higher flood wall. That has met with opposition over what a concrete barrier would do to the riverside view and the large cost to local taxpayers. But the bigger issue, the mayor said, is that cities such as Davenport should no longer act alone. “You talk to some people here and they’re, ‘Just put up a flood wall’. But you step back a little and that isolationism isn’t necessarily the best approach today,” said Klipsch. “The river is not one city but a whole system in of itself so that whatever one city does it impacts others along the river. What we do here very well may have a very detrimental effect on cities down river. One of our small cities, Buffalo, just south of us, had tremendous flood problems now. If we were to put up a flood protection wall it would basically funnel an excessive amount of water and would literally blow that community away.” Klipsch, who visited Belgium recently and noted that the discussion around the climate crisis in Europe is a very different beast from in the US, said that even those who question why the weather is changing mostly no longer doubt that it is. That, he said, has opened the way to more honest discussion about how to deal with the practical effects. Klipsch is co-chair of the Mississippi River Cities and Towns Initiative of 124 mayors along the river, many of whom are increasingly outspoken in their belief that climate change is not only real but going to have an increasingly serious impact on their communities. “I haven’t heard anybody disagree that there are climate changes happening. The source of the climate change may be in debate for some. For many of us it’s not. But it still has to be dealt with. Even very conservative areas realize they’re struggling with many, many climate issues they’re going to have to deal with. When the problem is so clear, it’s easier to get everybody in the same room pushing in the same direction.” Klipsch said that in Davenport that means deciding what level of flooding the community is prepared to accept and whether that means allowing a larger part of the city to act as a flood plain in order to help protect towns downstream. That, in turn, would require the city to decide how to manage wider and more frequent incursions by the river. The baseball stadium on the river’s edge is already surrounded by its own flood wall and became a small island in the Mississippi for weeks. But the sewage and fresh water plants for the city also sit close to the river. “We’re looking at potential flood levels in the future and how to accommodate those. Should we start planning for 22 foot being more of a normal? Or 23? Or 24? Our big concern is we have to make sure the infrastructure stays functional,” said Klipsch.  But even now not everyone agrees that such planning is necessary. Andy Young, the mayor of Pacific Junction, does not pin the flood on climate change. It is, he said, a once-in-a-lifetime event. “My thought is Mother Nature had a lot to do with it because it was rain. That’s not climate change. It’s Mother Nature bringing on her fury,” he said. Turner disagrees. “I believe in climate change. The weather has really changed in the past years,” he said. The changing weather patterns have prompted a different discussion about priorities along the Missouri where criticism has focussed on the US Army Corps of Engineers which dams the river, and decides how much water to release downstream. Turner and others in Pacific Junction accuse the corps of keeping dam levels too high to preserve fish habitats and facilitate recreational boating. They say that means there is less capacity to contain a rush of water from a large snow melt or bomb cyclone, and the corps is then obliged to release large volumes of water downstream. Last year, a federal judge sided with farmers along the Missouri who blamed the corps for facilitating flooding. Hundreds of farmers and business owners across six states sued the corps, accusing it of putting wildlife conservation ahead of flood protection. The ruling said that if the army continues to manage the river and dams in the way that it does, then flooding can be expected to continue. Some environmentalists criticise the farmers themselves for taking over natural floodplains that should be used to contain overflow from the rivers and protect towns along the Missouri. They say there needs to be a discussion about returning the land to serving the river. For now though, the immediate struggle in Pacific Junction is to see whether the town even has a future. The mayor said it can come back. “A lot of these families have been down here between 40 and 80 years. I’m fourth generation. My daughter is a fifth. There is nothing that was untouched. It’s completely gutted. But we’ll start over again,” he said. Turner is doubtful. “I’d say we’d be lucky to get 25% back. I don’t think it’ll be a town anymore,” he said."
"George Monbiot wants the world to stop eating fish (Journal, 9 May). However, considering over a billion people rely on fish as part of their diet, many of them in poorer parts of the world, simply cutting fish out – even if it were possible – would deprive millions of people of an essential protein source and vital source of income. The Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) provides an international benchmark for sustainable fishing that ensures certified fisheries safeguard fish stocks and our oceans. Monbiot criticises the MSC for certifying unsustainable fisheries. But his examples include a tuna fishery that has nearly eradicated shark finning in its fishery. The steps taken by this certified fishery have helped to secure livelihoods for a suite of small-island developing nations, and they have contributed to the protection of important species, including sharks.  The Shetland dredged scallop fishery is also called out – yet this fishery has worked hard to be the only UK dredged scallop fishery to bear the MSC label. It covers less than 5% of Shetland waters, providing a haven for biogenic reefs and ecologically significant maerl beds in these waters. In fact, this fishery is inspiring a new direction for the UK scallop fleet, which is working with scientists, government, environmental groups and the UK seafood sector to forge a sustainable path forward. There is no simple solution to the challenges faced by our oceans, and in the context of a growing global population we need to find sustainable sources of seafood that safeguard our seas. The MSC is contributing to the solution through its rigorous eco-label programme by incentivising sustainable fishing at a global level to help preserve our seafood supplies for this and future generations. Making a global industry sustainable is complex and takes time. But the MSC is committed to global ocean sustainability by setting standards that help preserve our seafood supplies for this and future generations.Erin PriddleMSC program director, UK and Ireland • George Monbiot makes some key points about the devastation of fish stocks. Importantly, he also draws attention to the huge concentration of ownership – a very different image from the poor fisherman being destroyed by EU policies. However, he misses the fact that fishing subsidies have helped create this situation – subsidies for building more efficient boats with radar and sonar systems that make fishing rather like shooting into a barrel. Fishing subsidies, like farming subsidies, go to the rich few, not to the small operator. Greed is the reason for the decline of the industry.Sam LairdLe Causse, Souillac, France • Your editorial (A million species face extinction. One species is to blame – and will pay too, Journal, 8 May) does well to note that phytoplankton are “barely noticed at all”. When the microscopic oceanic organisms do get mentioned, it is entirely for absorbing carbon dioxide. But, like the carbon-extracting forests, they are even more significant for the fact that by using photosynthesis they trap the carbon from carbon dioxide and release the oxygen as a byproduct into the atmosphere. This oxygen is essential for all animal life, including humankind. Roughly one-third is released by rainforests and most of the remainder comes from marine plants of which the phytoplankton are the most significant members. Small increases in ocean temperatures devastate the growth of phytoplankton. We are one of the million species that face extinction as a result of ocean warming caused by climate change.Dr Keith SnellCockermouth, Cumbria • While the need for government action on climate change and environmental breakdown is urgent, all of those who are employed as leaders and managers in the public, private or third sectors should surely be looking closely at what their organisation can do to turn things round and making the necessary changes, sooner rather than later. Protesting is important, but it’s time now for all of us to take action in whatever sphere we can.Fiona CarnieBath • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

"A group of Torres Strait Islanders from low-lying islands off the northern coast of Australia will on Monday lodge a complaint with the United Nations human rights committee against the Australian government, alleging climate inaction. The complaint will assert that the Morrison government has failed to take adequate action to reduce emissions or pursue proper adaptation measures on the islands and, as a consequence, has failed fundamental human rights obligations to Torres Strait Islander people.  One of the complainants, sixth-generation Warraber man, Kabay Tamu, said in a statement: “When erosion happens, and the lands get taken away by the seas, it’s like a piece of us that gets taken with it – a piece of our heart, a piece of our body. That’s why it has an effect on us. Not only the islands but us, as people. “We have a sacred site here, which we are connected to spiritually. And disconnecting people from the land, and from the spirits of the land, is devastating. “It’s devastating to even imagine that my grandchildren or my great-grandchildren being forced to leave because of the effects that are out of our hands. “We’re currently seeing the effects of climate change on our islands daily, with rising seas, tidal surges, coastal erosion and inundation of our communities.” The non-profit coordinating the complaint by the Torres Strait Islanders says this will be the first climate change litigation brought against the Australian government based on a human rights complaint, and also the first legal action worldwide brought by inhabitants of low-lying islands against a nation state. Lawyers with environmental law non-profit ClientEarth, are representing the islanders, with support from British-based barristers. The UN Human Rights Committee is a body of 18 legal experts that sits in Geneva. The committee monitors compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The complainants are alleging that Australia has violated article 27, the right to culture; article 17, the right to be free from arbitrary interference with privacy, family and home; and article 6, the right to life. According to briefing material supplied by ClientEarth, the complaint alleges these rights have been violated both by Australia’s insufficient greenhouse gas mitigation targets and plans, and by its failure to fund adequate coastal defence and resilience measures on the islands, such as seawalls. Lawyers for the islanders allege that the catastrophic nature of the predicted future impacts of climate change on the Torres Strait Islands, including the total submergence of ancestral homelands, is a sufficiently severe impact as to constitute a violation of the rights to culture, family and life. The islanders want the government to commit at least $20m for emergency measures such as seawalls, as requested by local authorities, and sustained investment in long-term adaptation measures to ensure the islands can continue to be inhabited. They want a commitment to reduce emissions by at least 65% below 2005 levels by 2030 and going net zero before 2050 and a phase out of thermal coal, both for domestic electricity generation and export markets. ClientEarth’s lead lawyer for the case, Sophie Marjanac, said in a statement: “Climate change is fundamentally a human rights issue. The predicted impacts of climate change in the Torres Strait, including the inundation of ancestral homelands, would be catastrophic for its people. “Australia’s continued failure to build infrastructure to protect the islands, and to take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, constitutes a clear violation of the islanders’ rights to culture, family and life.” The impact of climate change has been a significant touchstone in the 2019 election. A recent poll from a respected foreign policy thinktank, the Lowy Institute, has found a majority of Australians believe global warming is a critical threat. The poll undertaken for Lowy says 64% of adults rank climate change number one on a list of 12 threats to Australia’s national interests, up six points from last year’s survey and a jump of 18 points since 2014. The 2019 result is the first time climate has topped the list of threats since Lowy began the research in 2006."

One big headline that Germany’s online tabloid Bild carries today is about the breaking off the Antarctic Pine Island ice chunk, which is the size of Berlin…880 sq km!

Bild calls it a “Monster Ice Berg!” and of course we are to believe that it is yet the latest sign of the coming climate apocalypse that we will all suffer unless we all run and hide under our beds and beg for mercy. According to Bild, the giant ice berg is about 60m high.
Simple mathematics tells us the volume is about 53 cubic km.
Bild mentions, quoting scientists, that such glacier calving of this magnitude is normal, and occur about every 10 years or so. But normalcy is not the message that Bild wants the reader to get, and so warns that the “monster iceberg” could pose a threat to shipping, and to animal life! Bild also says that scientists are deeply worried and writes:
The Pine Island glacier is huge and unstable, and thus it is difficult to judge the risk for global sea level rise.”
Such stupidity – of course aimed at quite uninformed, clueless readers, to say it diplomatically. How much global sea level rise should we expect? From various sources we can read that a large part is already underwater. But let’s assume that none of it is under water just for the calculation.
Sea level rise estimation:
Area of oceans: 362 million sq km
Volume of Pine Island chunk: 53 cu km
Sea level rise: 53 km3 divided by 362,000,000 km2 = 0.000000145 km = 0.000145 m = 0.145 mm = 145 microns
Given that much of it is already submerged in sea water, we can safely assume that sea level rise will be less then a tenth of a millimeter.
Quick – head for the hills!

"UK companies failing to tackle climate change would be delisted from the London Stock Exchange under radical plans for greening the economy being drawn up by Labour. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said he would consider changing the law if necessary to force UK-listed firms to take adequate steps to fight the “climate emergency” facing the planet.  In an interview with the Guardian, McDonnell said much of the City was already aware of the need to make faster progress towards a zero-carbon economy, but his proposals were about “weeding out those that are not taking it seriously”. “We’ve got to signal now that we’re being serious about tackling climate change. And we’re going to use every lever of government we possibly can to enable that to happen,” he said. The Committee on Climate Change says cutting greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 is necessary, affordable and desirable. Here are some of the actions needed to make that happen: • Petrol and diesel cars banned from sale ideally by 2030 and 2035 at the latest. • Quadrupling clean electricity production from wind, solar and perhaps nuclear, plus batteries to store it and connections to Europe to share the load. • Connection of new homes to the gas grid ending in 2025, with boilers using clean hydrogen or replaced by electric powered heat pumps. Plus, all homes and appliances being highly efficient.   • Beef, lamb and dairy consumption falling by 20%, though this is far lower than other studies recommend and a bigger shift to plant-based diets would make meeting the zero target easier. • A fifth of all farmland – 15% of the UK – being converted to tree planting and growing biofuel crops and restoration of peat bogs. This is vital to take CO2 out of the air to balance unavoidable emissions from cattle and planes. • 1.5bn new trees will be needed, meaning more than 150 football pitches a day of new forests from now to 2050. • Flying would not be banned, but the number of flights will depend on how much airlines can cut emissions with electric planes or biofuels.  The shadow chancellor said that as a backbench MP he had proposed that the criteria for a listing a company on the stock exchange should include human rights, trade union rights and environmental policy. “We’re now going to discuss how we can insert tackling climate change as one of the criteria for listing on the London stock market.” Asked whether he would delist firms without climate change plans that are already quoted on the stock exchange, McDonnell replied: “Yes”. Labour’s proposals are likely to set alarm bells ringing in the City, home to some of the world’s biggest natural resource companies. But the shadow chancellor said the measures were justified by the scale of the climate change challenge. “It’s not about threatening or penalising, it’s saying here’s the steps we need to take to save the planet, it’s as simple as that,” he said. The shadow chancellor’s tough message to the finance sector followed meetings with the Extinction Rebellion group that staged protests last month – including in the City of London. Activists glued themselves to the entrances of the stock exchange, wearing LED signs saying “Climate emergency”, “Tell the truth” and “You can’t eat money”. The steps to banish egregious polluters from the City form part of wider Labour plans to place climate change at the heart of its agenda for government, as the party readies for a possible autumn election. Should an election be called and the party win power, McDonnell said he would help form a “red-green” government and help push Britain to a low-carbon economy. “There’s a sweeping understanding, right the way across, that our administration has to tackle this issue in a way that no one else is taking that seriously,” he said. Labour has a target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050, or earlier if possible, while Jeremy Corbyn has acted to declare a formal climate emergency. The party has held a series of internal meetings to explore how government departments can pull together on the issue, while also discussing ways to reform the Bank of England’s powers. McDonnell suggested that if he became chancellor before a successor was chosen for Mark Carney, the Bank’s outgoing governor, he would seek to install someone who could lead the fight for greening the economy. “We do need someone fresh. We need someone who’s got an understanding of the challenges and climate change is a key one. And we need someone who is willing to be radical,” he said. The shadow chancellor said he had been impressed by Carney’s attempts to drive climate change up the agenda and that someone was required to push the issue to the next stage. “That does need some radical thinking,” he said. Carney used an article in the Guardian last month to warn that the global financial system faces an existential threat from climate change and needs reform. The governor is set to leave Threadneedle Street early next year. The search for his successor is due to conclude by October. McDonnell has previously said the Bank’s powers to tackle climate change risks in the financial system could be overhauled, as well as measures handing Threadneedle Street a target for raising productivity growth in the UK economy. As part of those reforms, the shadow chancellor suggested Threadneedle Street could be given a climate change target. It could also be told to apply its policy toolkit to green the economy, including potential measures to penalise carbon-linked assets. Possible measures could include forcing banks to increase the financial reserves they hold to protect against losses for carbon assets. McDonnell said he thought the finance sector was ready for the changes, as growing numbers of investment management firms signal they will alter investing rules to take account of climate change. “The debate is beginning to change. The writing is on the wall and they’re going to see opportunities in the mechanisms for tackling climate change as well,” McDonnell said. “We want to signal change is coming and we’re serious about climate change.”"
"Last week a small campaign group in the staunchly conservative town of Shrewsbury called a public meeting about climate change. The organisers were delighted when 150 people turned up. Even they were surprised, though, when people unanimously said they were prepared to give up flying, change their boilers and cars, eat less meat and even overthrow capitalism to get a grip on climate change. But this was just a straw in the political wind whipping through middle England. Shrewsbury joins more than 100 other councils across the country in declaring a climate emergency, and has pledged that it will be carbon-neutral within 11 years, with more following every week.  The stakes get higher every day. In the past week, not only have the world’s leading scientists dropped a bomb into the debate by stating, across 1,800 pages of detailed evidence, that our wholesale destruction of the biosphere threatens humanity just as much as climate change, but carbon levels in the atmosphere have reached their highest level in 800,000 years. So, could this be the moment when politicians recognise they have both strong intellectual reason to act urgently on the environment as well as, finally, the public backing to do so? When, instead of trying to score marginal partisan points, they believe they have the legitimacy to be non-partisan, politically bold, and to together back transformative economic and social change in pursuit of the public good? Could politics indeed be changing with the climate? The last few months have seen the debate shift. Put it down to David Attenborough’s documentary, 1.5 million children on school strike, the charisma of Greta Thunberg, or sheer frustration with the political system, but increasing numbers of people now seem to recognise that nature’s wellbeing is a national priority. The UK government, keen to position itself as a world leader on climate, but still promoting flying and roads and less keen to act at home, recognises the moment. Cambridge development economist Sir Partha Dasgupta has been commissioned to conduct a major study on the case for acting on biodiversity, much as Lord Stern was asked to review the economics of climate change by Gordon Brown in 2006. Stern’s 700-page report added greatly to the debate. But that was 13 years ago, since which time there have been many highly authoritative studies done on environmental economics. No new report is needed. They all argue roughly the same: that it will cost infinitely more for governments to do nothing about biodiversity and climate than to act decisively, and that to delay will increase costs further. Dasgupta can only argue that we must act soon. Besides, while it sounds impressive to bring forward by 30 years the target for net-zero emissions, few countries think it will be too difficult. Belgium, Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden have asked the EU to set 2050 as a target for being carbon-neutral, and want 25% of the EU budget to go to fighting climate change. For the moment, governments have little to lose. Most consumers would barely notice the changes needed to get to carbon neutrality in 30 years’ time. Who noticed that Britain has just had the first week in more than 100 years of electricity without coal, or that divestment from fossil fuels has reached $8tn? People will have to buy electric cars, more efficient fridges and heating systems, and Britain will need vastly more solar capacity, bigger forests and better insulation, but these are mostly easy and popular changes. A “new green deal” budget could be brought in to fund a massive push for nature conservation and energy change. The ban on new petrol and diesel cars and vans after 2040 could be brought forward to 2030 easily enough, and few people would object to penalties for climate polluters, higher taxes for companies that destroy nature and incentives for renewable energy and energy conservation. If Heathrow never got its new runway, or we did not build more roads, or we all ate less meat, it would not hurt that much. Indeed, it’s clear that protecting nature brings great collective rewards. Weaning ourselves off fossil fuels would clear up air pollution rapidly and save billions of pounds a year that the NHS must currently spend dealing with heart attacks, asthma, strokes and respiratory illnesses. Cities would become more liveable, the countryside more attractive. Instead of being regarded by government as a costly imposition, action on climate and nature regeneration could be easily recast as visionary politics offering huge public benefits. But what happens when the voluntary measures run out and the warming is not seen to slow because greenhouse gases are so long-lasting? Really addressing climate and biodiversity collapse means rationing carbon. It means no more free ride for extractive industries such as mining, palm oil and forestry companies who profit from environmental destruction. It means heavy penalties for polluters, the axing of food and aviation subsidies, and taking a torch to vested interests. It means addressing the indirect causes of the crisis, such as population growth and consumerism, even rethinking the whole idea of progress and wealth. There are dangers in both action and inaction. How will rich countries react to mass migrations from poor climate-affected countries, or to the breakdown of the food system that might ensue when climate change leads to disastrous harvests in major rice- and wheat-producing countries? Already, the UN says, there are around 2,500 conflicts over fossil fuels, water, food and land. Climate change and biodiversity loss will only increase that number. Then there is the risk that the climate crisis could foster a new generation of authoritarian, top-down rulers who will try bypassing consumers and institutions. This is because it necessitates a major shift from the kind of individual responsibility we have grown used to in the past 50 years, to greater state action. That could easily be exploited. It also opens the door for rich governments to propose dangerous and ill-thought-through technological fixes as a substitute for mitigation. How much simpler for cash-strapped governments to ask a few billionaires to help slow warming in the US or Europe by funding a monstrously expensive plan to preserve the Arctic sea ice by covering it with a layer of reflective silica “microbubbles”; or to deflect the sun’s rays in space; or to spray the oceans with iron filings? But the risks of doing nothing far outweigh the possible pitfalls of really addressing climate change and biodiversity collapse. Of course there will be objections from diehard capitalists and liberals alike. But, to echo Margaret Thatcher as she pushed through the deregulation that has done so much to fuel the crisis: there really is no alternative. • John Vidal is a former Guardian environment editor"

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s been interesting reading some of the reactions from the green, warmist sites. Of course they are all seething in rage and resignation as their unclean movement collapses.None of them up to now have presented any scientific arguments refuting the claims made by Lüning and Vahrenholt.
Indeed many forget that geologist and climate-paleontologist Lüning is also one of the authors and brings more expertise to the book than many of those who reside in bloated “climate institutes” and call themselves climate scientists. The book is not written by just an “RWE boss”.
The very green Financial Times Deutschland (Germany) has been running a reader poll here since February 8.
The results? The FTD may be green, and maybe many of its readers, but FTD’s readers are also obviously open-minded, or just downright skeptical.
Survey: The climate view of Fritz Vahrenholt is…
Answer 1: humbug – 10%
 Answer 2: rhetoric of a lobbyist – 20%
 Answer 3: good food for thought – 28%
 Answer 4: 100% right on! – 42%
Number of votes: 4800
I suspect that a number of readers really don’t see any real changes in the climate, except that we are back to cold winters here in Germany, which of course flies in the face of projections of warming. And I suspect that many see through the scam. They see who’s making money, and where it is all taking us.

"Parks are being hit by cutbacks in local authority spending and the National Lottery’s “Parks for People” funding scheme is winding down. This matters because our parks are more than recreation areas, important as that is. The green spaces in towns and cities capture and store carbon from the air in trees and soil. They help soak up big downpours of rain that could otherwise cause localised flash flooding, and they can also help reduce air pollution. And as summers grow hotter, trees also cool the air in what can be overheated urban areas.  A recent study in the US found that trees in particular can have a profound cooling effect by as much as 5C. Trees provide cool areas of shade and behave like air conditioners as water evaporates from their leaves and cools the air. The biggest cooling effect comes from large numbers of trees, with tree canopies that cover 40% or more of an area giving the best results. This can also be seen in temperature maps of London, with levels tending to rise from outer London and peaking in the centre, but with cooler areas in urban parks. Another finding from previous research is that the best cooling effect is from healthy and fast-growing trees."

This is a follow-up article on GHCN and GISS changes to the temperature records for Reykjavik, Iceland.

Figure 1: Reykjavik, Iceland: Photo from Christian Bickel 
We now know that GHCN has changed data set versions from version 2 to version 3. Each of those versions has a history. Version 2 was made up by combining records from closely related stations, then “homogenizing” the combination to produce a data “product.” Version 3 presumably started from the Version 2 data set with revisions prompted by additional data. That presumption may not be correct.
As a first step, all the data from the Version 2 database were downloaded from GISS. There were four sets of station data, covering various years, but only one set that covered the period from 1901 to 1948. These are all plotted together in Figure 2, along with the combined dataset, and the “homogenized” result.

Figure 2: This is all the Reykjavik Version 2 data.
Three of the original data sets lie atop each other for the period from 1949 to the present. One set (the 4th one) is slightly warmer (!) in the years from 1982 to the present, and was ignored. However the homogenized data differs from the original data by a large amount early in the record, tapering down to no difference in the present, warming the past. Figure 3 is that difference.

Figure 3: This is the Version 2 homogenized data minus the Version 2 Combined data.
Each of those distinct steps in Figure 3 is exactly six years long. This arbitrary pattern cannot be anything but deliberate. It cannot be based on site changes, equipment changes, or any other factor that might change the real temperature. This is artificial.
The Iceland Meteorological Office has not moved since being built at this location in 1920. There may have been instrument changes, but no position changes.
GHCN describes their homogenization process:
Many surface weather stations undergo minor relocations through their history of observation. Stations may also be subject to changes in instrumentation as measurement technology evolves. Further, the land use/land cover in the vicinity of an observing site may also change with time. Such modifications to an observing site have the potential to alter a thermometer’s microclimate exposure characteristics and/or change the bias of measurements, the impact of which can be a systematic shift in the mean level of temperature readings that is unrelated to true climate variations. The process of removing such “non-climatic” artifacts in a climate time series is called homogenization.”
But Version 2 has been abandoned. We now have version 3. Figure 5 is a plot of both original and homogenized versions of both Version 2 and Version 3.

Figure 5: This is a plot of “original” and “homogenized” datasets for both Version 2 and Version 3.

Note that in Figure 5, from 1901 to about 1970, there is little agreement between the four datasets. Figure 6 is the difference between Version 2 after combining, and Version 3. (SCAR is not a factor in this data. SCAR is the acronym for Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research. No Antarctic data was harmed in the production of Reykjavik data).

Figure 6: This is the difference between Reykjavik Version 3 and Version 2 after combining the data from 4 datasets.
It is not clear why these differences exist. Prior to 1946, there were no nearby stations to compare. The Keflavik airport station did not produce data until 1949, and then the temperatures there agree very well with the original data from the downtown stations. The variances are within a few 100ths of a degree. The warm years around 1940 are wiped out in Version 3. But the changes don’t end there.

Figure 7. This is the difference between Version 3 before and Version 3 after GISS homogenization.
In Figure 7 we see the arbitrary and regular stair-steps again. But note that the steps are different from the steps in Figure 3, and they are in addition to the changes by GHCN seen in Figure 6. These changes put back some (but not all) of the cooling that was arbitrarily introduced in Figure 6. The final result is the product of two homogenizing
processes, the first by GHCN, and the second by GISS. The result of all this is the graph that Paul Homewood produced (below) and the blue and bold-red traces in Figure 5.
The GHCN Version 3 data was supposed to be superior to version 2, filling data gaps, etc. If this is so, then why does Version 3 have gaps where Version 2 does not? Version 3 has gaps for 1926, 1946, 1966, and 2008 – 2009. The original data (Version 2 raw) does not have these gaps.

Figure 8: This is from Paul Homewood’s article How GISS has totally Corrupted Reykjavik’s Temperature, used by permission.
There have been many changes like this to the temperature records. Here is a list of stations that have had arbitrary stair-step or other changes, and the links to articles that describe them:
Darwin, Australia, here, by Willis Eschenbach.
Central Park, New York City, here, by E. M. Smith, the Chiefio.
Prague, Czech Republic, here, and here, by John O. Sullivan.
Russia, (scroll to the bottom for the article) here, RIA/NOVOSTI.
Matanuska Valley, Alaska, here, Willis Eschenbach.
Ostrov Dixon, Ostrov Kotel, Russia; Barrow, Alaska, and others, here, Ed Caryl
Many of those in the above list were changes imposed in version 2. We should revisit those stations using version 3 data. So many stations, so little time…

"The Greens would support a future Labor government to use regulation to enforce climate policy in the event of a hostile Senate, Greens leader Richard Di Natale says. The Victorian senator says he is confident the Greens will be able to work with Labor leader Bill Shorten, despite Shorten not responding to a letter he sent last year asking them to do just that.  Di Natale says that if the Senate crossbench is populated by right-wing parties opposed to climate action, he will support a Labor government using other means to achieve environmental goals. “We have to work hard in an environment where no one has the balance of power in their own right... to look for common ground and work to achieve it,” Di Natale says. “Some changes, like those to the safeguard mechanism, might be made through regulation rather than legislation and I hope that a Labor government recognises that Australians want them to take very strong and decisive action. “We know that there are some changes that we won’t need a parliament to support.” Just last week, the Greens criticised the Coalition for making changes to the emissions safeguard mechanism, established as part of the Direct Action scheme to set “baselines” or limits for big polluters. The Coalition changes raised the limit for big polluters, but the same method could be used to reduce emissions limits in a backdoor cap-and-trade scheme. Di Natale was speaking from his office in Collins Street, Melbourne, in the second last week of the campaign. This city has been the party’s stronghold since the early 2000s, but support has taken a hit in recent years because of infighting, and it lost half its state MPs at last year’s Victorian election. Melbourne is poised to play a decisive role in the election next Saturday, which Di Natale believes Labor will win with the help of Greens preferences. But despite voters saying climate change is the most pressing issue when determining whom to vote for, and some commentators arguing that the Greens vote is likely to hold steady as a result, the party has been largely absent from media coverage of the campaign. Labor’s focus on climate change, even if its policies are significantly less ambitious than those put forward by the Greens, has allowed the bigger party to soak up much of the oxygen in the climate debate. It is frustrating, Di Natale says, because Labor’s policy lags behind market trends in the energy sector. “That’s what’s going to happen if we sit back and let the market do this for us without any intervention,” he says. Labor has proposed a target of 50% of electricity generation from renewable sources by 2030; 50% of new vehicle sales to be electric by 2030; and no ban on the mining, burning or export of fossil fuels. It has equivocated on ruling out the Adani coalmine, which the Greens oppose, and has been criticised for supporting a plan to extract gas from the Beetaloo basin in the Northern Territory. The Greens policy calls for 100% of electricity generation to come from renewable energy sources and 100% of new car sales to be electric by 2030; a plan to phase out the coal, oil and gas industry and create a transition package for workers; the reintroduction of a carbon price; and a resources super profits tax. “It’s all well and good to talk about renewables and a target but unless you are bringing down pollution, unless you are transitioning away from coal ... then it doesn’t matter what you do with renewables,” Di Natale says. “The primary source of the problem is increasing pollution from coal and we have to have a plan to drive that down.” The director of the Energy Change Institute at the Australian National University, Prof Ken Baldwin, says Australia will reach 100% renewable energy in the early to mid 2030s if the current rate of renewable energy installation is maintained. He says reaching the Greens’ target without damaging the economy is “within the realm of possibility” provided there is careful planning to transition the electricity grid and the fossil fuel workforce to a renewable economy. If Australia does not get the energy sector to do the heavy lifting on meeting its international obligations on reducing emissions, “we’re stuffed,” Baldwin says. But he says the proposed ban on coal, oil and gas exports could be counter-productive and argues that Australia should continue to export fossil fuels to developing countries, if it can provide a cleaner source than otherwise available. That’s the argument the resources minister, Matt Canavan, has used to support the proposed Adani mine. Whether the Greens are able to influence Labor climate policy will depend on the make-up of the Senate. Clive Palmer’s United Australia party is vying to take the balance of power, thanks to a preference deal struck with the Liberals. The Centre Alliance and Pauline Hanson’s One Nation party also hold some spots, and Fraser Anning’s extreme right-wing Conservative National party is running 70 candidates. Scott Morrison has joined conservative commentators in describing the Greens as equal and opposite to the right-wing minor parties in seriousness and scope. Di Natale says the comparison is “a smokescreen for Scott Morrison doing a deal with racists and climate deniers”. Deakin University politics lecturer Geoffrey Robinson says the comparison is unfair. “The Palmer party is obviously a kind of personal vehicle largely devoid of any policy commitment whatsoever,” Robinson says. “To compare the Greens and One Nation depends on your views about xenophobic populist nationalism versus Greens social democracy … but even there I think you can argue that the Greens give a lot more serious thought to policy than One Nation has.” The Greens have form in getting some of those policies enacted. The banking inquiry, the royal commission into the abuse of people with disabilities, the medevac legislation carried in the lower house by independent MP Kerryn Phelps, as well as bipartisan support for a federal anti-corruption body, could all be credited to the Greens in the last term of parliament. Labor’s shift on the live sheep export trade, its recent announcements on environmental protection laws, expanding free dental care to pensioners, and the bipartisan commitment to establish a national integrity commission can also be traced to the Greens. And despite being in politics to “get good outcomes”, they would like to get that credit. “If you don’t get credit for a reform, people don’t know you’re responsible for it and they’re less likely to support you,” Di Natale says. “And the bottom line in politics is if people are going to continue to support the work that you do, they need to know what you deliver on.” In the 46th parliament, the Greens’ focus will be on raising Newstart and the Youth Allowance. The income payment has not been increased in real terms since 1994. A report by Deloitte Access Economics last year put the cost of increasing the payment at $3.3bn, which Di Natale says can be borne by pursuing multinational tax avoidance and axing subsidies to fossil fuel companies. “This is front and centre,” he says. “This has to be one of the first things that a new government looks at and $75 a week is what people deserve and need.” Labor has pledged to review Newstart if elected. Di Natale says he has had “informal conversations” with the Centre Alliance on supporting the policy. “I don’t want to put words in their mouth but I am pretty confident ... I am confident that we will be able to get this reform though the Senate,” he says. Robinson says that of all the Greens’ policies, raising Newstart is the one most likely to have success under a potential Shorten government. “Labor voters want Newstart to go up,” he says. Also high on the list are universal Medicare-funded dental care; Medicare-funded mental healthcare; a ban on political donations from the mining, property development, tobacco, alcohol and gambling industries; and a ban on politicians and their senior staff from accepting a lobbying job within five years of leaving parliament. Di Natale is also eager to prosecute media reform. On Saturday he and Shorten were due to appear side-by-side in Melbourne at the ABC Friends leaders’ forum. In his speech Di Natale warns the Murdoch media empire “will not give up its stranglehold on our media and the control of our politics that comes with it without a fight”. “The Greens will do what needs to be done to rein in the malign influence of News Corp, to protect and strengthen our ABC and to encourage more diversity in our media landscape.” Di Natale will ask Labor to adopt the Greens’ media policy to set up a new public interest test for media mergers, as recommended by the 2012 convergence review and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, and strengthen the Australian Communications and Media Authority to give it “real teeth”. Di Natale is optimistic of making progress even on those challenges, based on the Greens’ record in the last parliament. “We have delivered serious reforms,” Di Natale says. “It’s easy to stand up in parliament, to make outrageous comments, to wear a burqa into the parliament, to give a first speech where you invoke the final solution, and get coverage. “It’s much more difficult but much more important to advance a serious policy agenda for the country. That’s what we’re about, and we’ve delivered in spades for people.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt Climate Depot the ever active Marc Morano brings our attention to the troubles dogging the massively subsidized GM Chevy Volt and compares it to the communist East German Trabant:

Neil Cavuto however admits he doesn’t know what a “Trabi” is. Nothing wrong with that – not everyone can have the fortune of being brought up in communist East Germany – that state run socialist paradise that America now longs to be. So I thought I’d show Neil what he missed out on living in the capitalistic West.

Worse than Inspector Columbo’s car!
My first experience with a Trabi was back in early 1990, just after I had first moved from the US to West Germany and the Wall had fallen. With the border open and East Germans free again to travel unrestricted for the first time in 30+ years, many of them took a drive into West Germany for the first time. On the autobahns Beamers, Audis, and Mercedes Benzes were zooming by in the fast lane at 140 mph as the tiny two-stroke 25 hp Trabants could barely muster going 50 mph. The contrast between West and East could not have been more stark.

East Germans had to wait 15 years for delivery of a new Trabi. Not because demand for them was high – but because it took that long for the state-run factories to build and deliver them. In 1990, the Trabant was technically stuck in the 1940s. If you had an accident in it, the best you could hope for was a quick death.
East German TV spot
Here’s the Trabant 601 – with 600 cc air-cooled 2-stroke engine, fully synchronized 4-speed transmission, 28 mpg highway! Available in any color (as long as it’s beige).

So get your new Government Motors Chevy Volt today, and relive the good ol communist days! Folks, this is what the state-planned, government-run economy can deliver – if only you’ll just give it the chance.
So Neil was right about one thing: It was a real doozie.

"Last year, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) called for “rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society” to avert full blown climate catastrophe. It’s not too late to stave off the worst impacts, they urged – indeed, it’s “possible within the laws of physics and chemistry”. But we need to act fast. Presidential candidate Joe Biden, 76, seems to have a very different understanding of the climate crisis than the world’s leading climate scientists. Several top advisers to the former vice-president previewed his “middle of the road” plan on the issue for Reuters on Friday. He’ll have the US rejoin the Paris agreement, which Trump has said he will leave exit as soon as that document’s terms allow in early 2021. He’ll preserve existing regulations on emissions and fuel efficiency that the current administration has targeted. Like Obama, he’ll embrace an “all of the above” energy strategy, with plenty of room for new natural gas development and exports as well as carbon capture and storage, to indefinitely extend the life of the coal industry.  The Sunrise Movement – one of the leading groups pushing for a Green New Deal – has rightfully called Biden’s plan a “death sentence for our generation”, advocating instead the kind of economy-wide mobilization scientists have urged. “Right now, we need a little bit more reality around this dialogue,” Heather Zichal told Reuters, taking a swipe at such plans. Zichal, “who has become Biden’s informal advisor on climate change policy,” Volcovici writes, also served as a top climate advisor to the Obama administration. Until recently, she sat on the board of directors of Cheniere Energy, a natural gas company that would stand to profit handsomely if federal policy stands by natural gas as a so-called bridge fuel to renewables. Her resignation from Cheniere, an official statement of theirs clarified, “was not due to any disagreement with the company or its management with respect to any matter relating to the company’s operations, policies or practices”. And why would she? Before leaving Cheniere last summer, she made over $1m through her four year stretch there, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings. The only reality Zichal seems concerned with is one where the the fossil fuel companies that she has gotten rich off of keep realizing fat profits. Scientific reality is a different story. A recent report from Oil Change International found that allowing the industry continuing to explore for and extract all the new fuel deposits they intend to would run directly counter to the goals inscribed in the Paris agreement. As the IPCC report indicates, meeting those will mean that global natural gas usage decline by 74% by mid-century – and arguably much faster in the US. Staying below 2C means keeping 80% of known fossil fuel reserves buried underground. As out of touch as they are with the scale of the climate challenge, Biden’s industry-friendly plans aren’t surprising. In a video announcing his White House bid, Biden painted Donald Trump’s presidency as an aberration. His promise? Get the country back to business as usual. Presumably, that also means the business of digging up and and burning as many fossil fuels as humanly possible. Last November, Obama bragged to a crowd in Houston about the explosion of oil and gas drilling during his time in office. “Suddenly America’s like the biggest oil producer and the biggest gas – that was me, people,” he said, fishing for an applause. The upshot here isn’t complicated: Biden does not have a plan to keep warming below 1.5 or even 2C. If every country fully lived up to its pledges in the Paris agreement, for instance – including the Clean Power Plan the Obama administration crafted to satisfy its contribution – we’d be on track for a little over 3C of warming, displacing tens of millions of people from the world’s coastal cities, submerging low-lying island states and gravely threatening the world’s food supply. As atmosphere scientists Andrew Dessler told HuffPost’s Alexander Kaufman, Biden’s plans would “be more in line with stabilizing at 3-4C of warming, rather than staying below 2C”. “Middle Class Joe” may well believe that the climate crisis poses an existential threat, which is more than can be said of the current administration. If his climate plan is to get us back to 2016, he’s not any more in touch with reality than they are. • This article was amended on 14 May 2019. An earlier version incorrectly stated Biden’s age as 79. He is 76."

We recall the climate discussion that had been planned to take place at the European Society of Engineers and Industrialists (SEII) in Brussels on September 1-2, 2011, and how IPCC vice president Jean-Pascal van Ypersele attempted to suppress it. Eventually it was relocated and took place somewhere else not far away.
The following is an uneditted raw clip of the discussion (sorry, not a professionally made film). It features distinguished scientists S. Fred Singer and Claes Johnson (see outline below in case you wish to skip to other parts).

Introduction (you can skip this)
10.00 – 31.00: 
Tropospheric hot spot, models vs. observations.
31.10 – 48.30:
Hockeystick, Climategate, 20th century temperature, “1976 – 2000 warming is fake”

Ocean temperature measurement
61.00 – 69.00 
Michael Mann, the Hockey Stick, proxies:
Singer’s 3 Conclusions (69.00 min.):

"Climate change is transforming life by redrawing coastlines, turning vast areas of forest into infernos, stirring enormous storms and spreading exotic diseases. An indirect casualty of this upheaval could be Joe Biden’s hopes of becoming US president. Biden, frontrunner in the polls to secure the Democratic nomination, has not laid out a plan to address the crisis. This is set to change, according to Reuters, with the Biden campaign working on a strategy to reinstate climate policies torn down by Donald Trump, such as restrictions on coal-fired power plants and vehicle fuel efficiency requirements. The plan, which is being worked on by the former Barack Obama adviser Heather Zichal, would see the US remain in the Paris climate agreement and offer support for nuclear energy and also natural gas, which is generally cleaner than coal but still emits planet-warming pollutants. Biden is also said to favour nascent carbon capture technology, which aims to contain and store emissions from industrial facilities. But this “middle ground” approach has been roundly attacked by environmental groups and progressive Democrats for being woefully insufficient. More importantly, it does not appear to chime with the urgent action scientists say is required to avert disastrous climate change. A landmark UN report last year stated that “unprecedented”, “rapid and far-reaching” transformations across energy, land use and transportation are needed to avoid increasingly dire flooding, wildfires, heatwaves, food insecurity and unrest. “A ‘middle ground’ policy that’s supportive of more fossil fuel development is a death sentence for our generation and the millions of people on the frontlines of the climate crisis,” said Varshini Prakash, director of the Sunrise Movement, a youth climate change organization allied to progressive Democrats such as the New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. “Biden’s betting that a retreat to mediocrity and tepid policymaking will garner him the Democratic nomination, but climate change is a top issue in this election and voters expect candidates to put forward solutions in line with the crisis.” Ocasio-Cortez has championed the Green New Deal, which calls for a national mobilization against climate change on a par with the second world war. The concept has garnered support among some of Biden’s rival presidential nominees including senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. The GND, perhaps alongside the severe hurricanes and wildfires that have rattled Americans over the past two years, has helped elevate the issue of climate change to a leading priority for Democratic voters. A CNN poll in April found that climate change was the single most important matter for Democrats, eclipsing healthcare, gun control and impeaching Trump, with 96% saying it was somewhat or very important to them. This rapid shift in priorities threatens to cast Biden’s candidacy as out of touch, even at this early stage. A climate plan deemed feeble by primary voters could harm the former vice-president in a new landscape where the Democratic National Committee is being pushed to hold a climate change-only debate and one candidate, the Washington governor, Jay Inslee, is running solely on the issue of global warming. “We cannot simply go back to the past; we need a bold climate plan for our future,” Inslee said of Biden’s stance on climate change. “Facing a crisis does not permit half-measures. Half-measures mean full extinction of millions of species and full economic damage to communities across America.” Biden has never been at the forefront of the climate movement but is positioning himself as a pragmatic operator who gets things done, including having aided the passage of the Paris climate deal. In a recent rally in Iowa, Biden said he was “one of the first guys to introduce a climate change bill, way, way back in 87”, a reference to his successful attempt to get President Ronald Reagan to set up a taskforce on the issue. TJ Ducklo, a spokesman for Biden, tweeted that the former vice-president had called climate change an “existential threat”. “He knows how high the stakes are,” Ducklo tweeted. “As president, Biden would enact a bold policy to tackle climate change in a meaningful and lasting way, and will be discussing the specifics of that plan in the near future. Any assertions otherwise are not accurate.” Proponents of the GND hope that if Biden does manage to secure the Democratic nomination he will embrace the plan due to its focus on creating high-paying jobs in clean energy generation. The worry for climate activists is that the issue could revert to being largely overlooked, much like in the 2016 election, should Biden end up facing Trump in the 2020 contest. “If you’re running to lead the nation, you need to have a plan on climate change given it will be the most catastrophic thing to happen to us,” said Rhiana Gunn-Wright, policy director at New Consensus, which helped design the Green New Deal. “It’s disappointing Joe Biden hasn’t said more. Beto [O’Rourke], Warren and Inslee have all released a plan, so Biden in many ways is an outlier. “The next presidential election will be crucial, but this is a movement not solely focused on that. The Green New Deal is built to exist beyond this election season. People are energized and they want to fix this,” Gunn-Wright said."

Share this...FacebookTwitterMarc Morano here recently made what ought to be an obvious point: It’s immoral not to use fossil fuels, which are cheap and plentifully at our disposal. Today they can be burned more cleanly and efficiently than ever. Moreover, the science shows that they don’t have a significant impact on climate.To solve the poverty that still ravages many parts of the world, it is imperative that these impacted regions be supplied with the essential cornerstone of development: cheap ENERGY. It’s a fact: The more energy people consume, the more their standards of living improve. Take a look at the 2 following tables.
Per capita GDP, selected countries 
[US $]
1. Norway 55,000
2. USA 47,000
3. Australia: 41,000
4. Canada: 39,000
5. Germany: 36,000
6. Japan: 34,000
7. Russia: 16,000
8. Mexico: 14,000
9. China: 7,600
10. India: 3,500
11. Sudan: 2,300
12. North Korea: 1,800
13. Ethiopia: 600
Per capita energy consumption of randomly selected countries 
[kilograms of oil equivalent]
1. Canada: 8300
2. USA 7800
3. Norway 5900
4. Australia: 5700
5. Russia: 4400
6. Germany: 4200
7. Japan: 4000
8. Mexico: 1530
9. China: 1140
10. North Korea: 900
11. India: 510
12. Sudan: 480
13. Ethiopia: 280
Compare the position of each country in the 2 tables. What do you notice?
It should be no surprise that the countries with higher per capita energy consumption also have higher per capita GDP, i.e. far better standards of living. On the other hand, countries that consume very little energy have impoverished standards of living and much misery. It’s almost 1 to 1. No country that consumes lots of energy is living in poverty, and no country that consumes little energy is living in prosperity. Of course there are other factors that come into play, such as education and freedom.
Depriving people of energy is not going to allevaite poverty, period. To the contrary, it will only make it worse.  Moreover, making the supply of energy more expensive by mandating costly renewables is only going to result in yet a further reduction in energy consumption in the third world – one they simply cannot afford. Expensive alternative energy sources there will only make the catastrophic living conditions there even worse.
Preventing the construction of power plants and the drilling of gas and oil will also have the same devastating effects.
An extreme example is Somalia. There even the fundamental source of energy for human life – FOOD – is now in short supply. The big problem there is not that there is a global shortage of food, but rather it is that huge amounts of the global food stocks are being converted into biofuels to combat fantasized AGW. That criminal kind of energy-deprivation enacted by the west needs to stop – and soon.

"Australia’s biodiversity is in trouble. The UN global assessment report painted a stark picture: the decline of the world’s natural support systems means that human society is in danger. According to the report, nature is being destroyed at a rate tens to hundreds of times higher than the average over the past 10 million years. More than a million species are at risk of extinction, natural ecosystems have declined by about 47% and the biomass of wild mammals has fallen by 82%. All of this is largely because of human activity. And the resulting impacts are likely to worsen unless we take action immediately. As Guardian Australia has reported, Australia’s natural support systems are at breaking point. Increased land-clearing, warming oceans and a drought exacerbated by climate change are taking their toll on our biodiversity. The country is already experiencing rising oceans, marine heatwaves, longer fire seasons and extreme heat patterns. These are consistent with a changing climate. However, there has been a lack of leadership from state and federal governments in this area, protections and funding have been slashed and emissions continue to rise unabated. Without drastic action, the future of Australia’s biodiversity looks bleak. There is a “extinction crisis unfolding in plain sight” in Australia. More than 50 animal and 60 plant species have been lost, with Australia recording the highest rate of mammalian extinction in the world over the last 200 years. There’s more to come. Conservative estimates put more than 1,800 plant and animal species and woodlands, forests and wetlands at risk of extinction due to the intertwined pressures of climate change, land use practices, habitat loss and invasive species. The downward trend could be stopped, say conservationists, but only if there is meaningful government intervention. The Australian Conservation Foundation’s James Trezise told Guardian Australia: “From a conservation standpoint we know what needs to happen, but it seems there isn’t the political will to get us there.” The lack of political engagement in these issues is staggering. In February 2018, it was revealed that less than 40% of Australia’s nationally listed threatened species have recovery plans in place and, for the 10% of listed threatened species that require plans, supporting documentation was unfinished, according to the environment and energy department’s own data. There hasn’t been any critical habitat listed on the federal critical habitat register for threatened species since 2005. And the Coalition has been accused of spending the $255m in threatened species funding on unrelated projects. Then in March, the federal environment department was forced to admit that it didn’t know whether recovery plans to prevent extinctions are actually being implemented. The disregard for the protection of these areas was made clear when Liberal senator Anne Ruston, the federal minister responsible for forests, said in February during a Senate debate: “I’m sure that trees were put on this earth in the very first instance because they were able to be cut down, because they would grow again and because they would provide a resource for myriad different things.” Climate change is increasing the pressure on our biodiversity – yet Australia’s emissions rise unabated. National emissions are the highest they have ever been, with the increased production of LNG the major contributor. Guardian Australia reported that emissions growth between 2015 and 2020 from the rapidly growing natural gas industry will effectively wipe out any gains already made. Questions have been raised about the government’s $2.5bn emissions reduction fund and whether it provided value for money with funding wasted on projects that would have gone ahead regardless. Emissions from land and forest clearing are also negating any gains made under the ERF. According to government data, forest-clearing has released more than 160m tonnes of carbon dioxide since the emissions reduction fund began in 2015, with an estimated 60.3m tonnes to be emitted in the next year. Although there has long been rainfall variability in Australia, King said other measures of drought including temperatures effects and evaporation changes pointed to a changed climate, with these patterns set to continue into the future. The UN report identified agriculture as one of the primary causes of the deterioration of biodiversity around the world. The deterioration of the Murray-Darling, the so-called food bowl of Australia, is a case in point. Some of Australia’s most eminent environmental scientists have warned that the Murray-Darling basin plan, the strategy set up to save Australia’s largest river system, is not delivering the environmental outcomes promised. They point to watered down rules, state and federal governments shy of delivering reform, over-extraction and a lack of compliance by irrigators and no allowances for climate change. The South Australian royal commission set up to investigate the issues found that government and MDBA officials were “guilty of maladministration, negligence and unlawful actions”. The commissioner, Bret Walker SC, also warned the Murray-Darling basin plan’s failure to take account of climate change was “potentially catastrophic”. Scientists have already reported that the climate in the region is changing, with temperatures rising and rainfall decreasing. The federal government and the authority, who had refused to take part in the royal commission, dismissed the findings. The UN report found the accelerating factors of climate change, pollution and invasive species were impacting the biodiversity of the world’s oceans. Climate change is also causing marine heatwaves to happen more frequently and with more intensity, which have a devastating impact on the ocean’s ecosystems. In our region, the extreme intense marine heatwave of 2017-18 caused major disruption including kelp habitat loss, new species invasions and fisheries season changes. It’s a stark warning of things to come."

Share this...FacebookTwitterWe always knew they were going to get nasty – really nasty. That’s because we are truly dealing with intolerant zealots here who react viciously and emotionally when their religion comes under fire. Their latest reaction is proof enough.
It’s enough to make any normal person sick. These Greenpeace fanatics are losing it.
We saw it with the TAZ in their recent headline “Skeptics are like viruses“.
Now Greenpeace has declared war  on Fritz Vahrenholt and Sebastian Lüning. Why? Because they chose to exercise their democratic right to free speech and to do what good science involves: practice a little scrutiny, and to get a dialog going – a dialogue that activists have been trying to shut down for years.
But for Greenpeace, no one has any business questioning global warming science or delivering good news like: the climate catastrophe is not coming. Greenpeace insists that a catastrophe is coming, and it intends to make sure no one threatens that prospect. They misrepresent any data that shows to the contrary. Greenpeace thinks everyone needs to remain in fear, if not of climate change, then of Greenpeace itself. No one must begin to doubt.
Greenpeace latest, highly emotional report released today is titled:
Fritz Vahrenholt: Der eiskalte Leugner
Fritz Vahrenholt: The Ice Cold Denier
In it Greenpeace claims that all the science in “Die kalte Sonne” is already debunked, cites their friend and ally Gavin Schmidt, and then tells everyone that the science is settled and that we should just believe them. Then GP portrays Vahrenholt as some kind of callous carbon monster who doesn’t care about people. Near the end GP writes:
As already today millions of people are dying or losing their homes because of increasing weather extremes, his cancellation of the ‘climate catastrophe’ comes across as being spiteful to humans.”
Ice cold denier? Millions dying? Welcome to the tolerant green Germany.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf an “expert” sits down for an interview with a leading media outlet, he should at least know what he’s talking about.
Unfortunately this was hardly the case for Georg Feulner of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) and Eicke Weber, Director of the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems in Freiburg, Germany, both giving recent interviews with leading German media outlets in an attempt to respond to Fritz Vahrenholt’s and Sebastian Lüning’s controversial book.
And both interviews ended with the scientists looking as if they lacked knowledge on climate change and the latest research.
In Feulner’s case, Lüning and Vahrenholt shred his claims in a report posted at WUWT, read here.
As far as Eicke Weber of the Fraunhofer Institute is concerned, in his interview here in Welt am Sonntag, he did himself no favors. The statements he made only revealed his knowledge has stunning deficiencies on the subject of climate science.
 ************************************************
The following is by Dr. Sebastian Lüning, which I translated from the German – some editing for clarity. (Original German here)
Weber confuses the Milankovitch cycles with the primary solar cycles
Already at the very start, Weber confuses the Milankovitch cycles with the primary solar activity oscillations. To put it simply: While the arguments of our book “Die kalte Sonne” focus mainly on the primary energy output from the sun, Weber in the interview speaks of changes in the Earth’s orbital parameters! These parameters lead to changes in the amount of energy reaching the Earth because of geometric reasons (see page 80-82). These so-called “Milankovitch” cycles are measured in time periods of tens of thousands of years, and so play no real role in today’s decadal-scale climate change.

Weber believes CO2 led temperature during the ice age / interglacial transitions
Weber commits another classic error – probably leftover damage from Al-Gore’s Film “An Inconvenient Truth”. Weber attempts to put the blame on atmospheric CO2 for the transitions between ice ages and interglacials. This falsehood has already been chalked up by Al Gore, and is one of the reasons why a British High Court forbade the AIT film to be shown in classrooms uncommented. If Weber had read our book on pages 129-131, then he would have learned of the correct correlation between the two. High resolution investigations of the last 600,000 years show that the temperature first increased, and then CO2 followed with a lag of 800 years. The CO2 increase was obviously caused by the temperature increase, and not vice versa.

Observe the last interglacial 130,000 to 110,000 years ago. Temperature plummeted even as CO2 stayed at about 260 ppm.
Weber believes in the 10,000-year hockey stick!
Contrary to what was suggested in the interview by solar energy expert Weber, during the Holocene (the last 10.000 years, since the last ice age) the climate was in no way stable. Here the ominous Hockey Stick was doing its magic. The fact, however, is that the climate was neither stable during the last 1000 years nor the last 10,000 years (see book p. 68-75). The climate was characterised by millenium cycles, where temperatures were for the most part in sync with solar activity. It is only by hiding these facts and correlations that climate science has succeeded in marginalizing the sun as a factor in the climate equations over the years. The models cannot in any way reproduce the climate of the last 10,00o years.
Weber simply dismisses all other climate factors
Then came Weber’s decisive statement in his interview: “To me it’s moot to discuss how the 0.75° Celsius increase observed over the last 50 years has come about when we see the record levels that CO2 concentrations have reached.” Eicke Weber obviously does not care about the individual natural and anthropogenic climate factors in the current climate development. This is a bit astonishing as it is precisely this knowledge that is important for making climate models and determining how temperature will develop in the coming decades.  For the Fraunhofer Director, it suffices to know that CO2 has reached a historical record level.
Here’s a short fact-check: Just how high is the current atmospheric CO2 concentration? Currently it is 0.039 percent. Over the greater part of the Earth’s history, CO2-concentration was significantly above that. This somewhat diminishes Weber’s use of the term “historical record high”. Here Weber suppresses the fact that the real climate discussion revolves around what is the correct value of the CO2 climate sensitivity (see book p. 220-225). CO2 by itself can produce a warming of only 1.1°C for each doubling. But the IPCC given values of up to 4.5°C, based on the poorly understood amplification effect of water vapour and clouds.
A normal reader of the interview most likely will not even notice Eicke Weber’s stunningly weak knowledge. But trust in our academic elite will however, be damaged for a long time to come.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe online DIE WELT today has a leading commentary here  on the fallout of Fritz Vahrenholt’s and Sebastian Lüning’s skeptic book that has delivered a body blow to the German global warming movement.The DIE WELT piece, written by Ulli Kulke, is titled:
“Climate science is the new replacement religion”
In contains a plea for calm and a reminder that global temperatures have gone nowhere over the last 13 years. DIE WELT writes:
Even one of the biggest prophets of climate catastrophe, Englishman Phil Jones, had to admit after the disclosure of thousands of e-mails from the IPCC a few years ago that the current temperature development is comparable to two other periods occurring in the last century.”
Moreover, DIE WELT writes that a real discussion and debate is constantly torpedoed by the global warming protagonists, and that they have a habit of ignoring inconvenient facts: DIE WELT writes:

The IPCC has ignored an entire field of science…
Very few people have recognised that in the research that Vahrenholt und Lüning are referring to has nothing to do with the irradiative heating of the sun, which indeed does not fluctuate much, but with the soilar winds which are increasingly shown to have an indirect impact on cloud formation, and thus influence the climate.
The IPCC has looked at this on the fringes and have determined that this research – which the renwoned CERN institute and others are carrying out -– is not far enough to allow conclusions to be drawn.
That may or may not be the case. But the fact remains that the IPCC, which is responsible for bringing the scientists together, still has not gotten the idea to invite these scientists for its large climate reports. Why not? After all it’s the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and not the Intergovernmental Panel on CO2.”
The positive feedbacks ASSUMED for CO2 with respect to water vapour are also very poorly understood. Yet the IPCC has no problems inflating those and including them in their climate reports.

Share this...FacebookTwitterJeez…can’t these guys make up their minds!
Here’s Der Spiegel writing about global warming in 1948, just 26 years before it warned the planet was cooling (1974), read that here, which was only 12 years before they again warned of warming (1986), read it here!
The 1948 piece is titled: It’s getting warmer on the planet. Below are a few of the excerpts. See if it all sounds familiar to you.
First Der Spiegel starts by telling us that “the Governor of California has declared an emergency in 28 counties of his state” and that the current drought there is “likely the most extreme in the last 500 years.”
Weather extremes, and Spitzbergen 7°C above normal
Back in 1948 Spiegel authors wrote of “unusual weather over the past year in Central Europe” and fears that “the climate of the old continent will not remain the same.”
And what would climate predictions be without a consensus of scientists? Der Spiegel wrote:
The scientists say: What is certain is that we now find ourselves in the middle of a large climate change. And it is the biggest in many parts of the world. Not only an increase in air temperatures, but also an increase in water surface temperatures in the oceans.
The most plain to see is the warming in the northern polar regions. Winter temperatures at Spitzbergen during the 1930/39 decade were 7°C over the 1926 measured mean.”
I don’t have my PDO and AMO chart here at my fingertips, but weren’t they at about their positive peaks back then?

Melting Arctic
There was also plenty of Arctic melting going on back then too, just like today! Der Spiegel wrote:
The “Northeast Passage” (the seaway north of Siberia) is like the “Northwest Passage” around Canada, which were earlier virtually impassible, have since become much easier. Amundsen needed 3 years to get through the Northwest passage at the start of this century. In autumn of last year, Canadian Larsen needed less than three months to overcome it. And Larsen had none of the impassable ice that Amundsen had to deal with.
“Catastrophic consequences” wrote Der Spiegel:
The polar climate improvement and the appearance of warmer waters in the northern seas are causing profound changes in plant and animal life.
The glaciers in Greenland, Spitzbergen and Nowaja Semlja, as well as the ones in the European mountains, have been retreating considerably for quite some time now. The complete melting of all glaciers would have catastrophic consequences: sea levels would rise about 55 meters.”
Warming causes both mild and cold winters, just like today! Der Spiegel wrote in 1948:
Warming has led to increased meteorological unrest. That means a tendency for more extreme climate, e.g. very mild and very harsh winters. In Frankfurt December 1934, January 1921 and February 1926 were the three mildest, and January 1940 and February 1929 were both the coldest winter months in over 100 years.”
Now get a load of their hypothesis for the cause!
Also cosmic causes, which are still mysterious to science, could be at play – changes in solar radiation and its composition. It appears to be much more than just a coincidence that the extreme weather year of 1947 just happened to be the biggest sunspot year in over 200 years. Periods of 80 and 110 year respectively have been detected.”
Message to scientists today: It’s the sun, stupid!

"Donald Trump’s interior secretary hasn’t “lost sleep over”, the record-breaking levels of pollution heating the planet, he told US lawmakers in an oversight hearing. The Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii observed carbon dioxide levels of 415 parts per million in the atmosphere on Friday – the highest ever documented.  Asked to rank his concern on a scale of 1 to 10, by the Pennsylvania Democratic congressman Matt Cartwright, David Bernhardt pointed to US climate progress. “I believe the United States is number 1 in terms of decreasing CO2,” Bernhardt said. Pushed to give a number, Bernhardt said: “I haven’t lost any sleep over it.” The US has put more carbon pollution into the atmosphere than any other nation in history. China is currently the biggest emitter, and the US ranks second. Carbon emissions in the US actually increased last year. The Trump administration has rolled back many of the Obama-era efforts to limit heat-trapping pollution and many Trump officials have questioned the severity of climate change and whether it is caused by human actions. Scientists agree that humans are the dominant cause of rising temperatures, including the fossil fuels they burn to drive vehicles and run power plants. A recent international science report warned that climate change threatens humans and a million other species. Bernhardt, a former oil and gas lobbyist, has been criticized for his decisions favoring industry. At the hearing on Wednesday, an activist in a “Swamp Thing” mask was in full view several rows behind him. Trump vowed to “drain the swamp” if he was elected president, but has appointed multiple former industry representatives to run his agencies."

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt wasn’t all that long ago when a number of climate scientists were projecting the Earth would soon fall into an almost permanent, increasing El Niño mode, where the surface temperatures of the equatorial Pacific would always be like what we saw in 1998 – all man-made.

Today a number of German-language papers are reporting that Norwegian scientist Tore Furevik of the Bjerknes Centre of the University of Bergen says he expects the opposite to happen at least this year. Furevik says that La Niña may come back for third straight year. “The situation is simlar to the previous year,” he says.
Die Welt here writes that “there are no signs that La Nina is going to disappear anytime soon” and that according to Norwegian experts “it will occur even more strongly than in 2011”.
The Wiener Zeitung of Vienna, Austria adds:
The La Niña phenomena has been persisting since 2010 and there are no signs of it going away. We had this strong cooling in 2010 and instead of getting warmer, we stayed in a long cold phase’, said Furevik. “And it appears as if an even stronger La Niña will occur.'”

Furevik’s La Niña forecast contradicts the experts’ forecast, where an ensemble of models show the trend towards an El Niño for the 2nd half of the year:

Since about 2005 the PDO phase has gone negative and is projected to stay that way for another 15-25 years – meaning cooler global temperatures.
If Furevik is right, it means that 2012 and the first half of 2013 will end up being cold. That’s bad news for those betting the Earth will warm further this decade. That means that the first quarter of the 2010s decade will be much cooler than the average of the last decade.

Negative PDO favors more frequent occurrence of cooling La Niñas.  Source: http://jisao.washington.edu/pdo/. The overall 60-year cycle shows we are now at the start of a cool phase.

"Britain’s move to “net zero” carbon and the declaration of a climate emergency in parliament will be “given careful consideration” in deciding whether to grant a review of Heathrow airport’s expansion, the government has said. The new approach falls well short of any commitment to review Heathrow’s expansion, but means the decision on whether to grant campaigners’ request for a review will include the net zero target and the climate emergency among its criteria.  Green campaigners welcomed the pledge, which came in a letter to environmental group Plan B. Tim Crosland, director of Plan B, said: “We’re pleased to see the government is taking seriously our request to review the expansion of Heathrow airport. The government can either take the necessary action to avoid climate breakdown or it can stick to business as usual and expand aviation, but it can’t have it both ways.” The letter is also one of the first indications of how the net zero target, recommended last week by the committee on climate change, and parliament’s vote to recognise a climate emergency, may be taken into account in future by civil servants giving advice to ministers on key issues such as transport and infrastructure. Green campaigners will be pressing the government to review existing policies on these issues in the light of the committee’s view that it is “necessary” for the UK to be net zero by 2050, arguing that policy decisions made previously are now invalid. Plan B wrote to the government on 2 May requesting a new review of the airports national policy statement (ANPS), under which the Heathrow expansion will take place, making that argument. In the letter to Plan B, seen by the Guardian, Caroline Low, the director of Heathrow expansion and aviation and maritime analysis at the Department for Transport (DfT), wrote: “I can confirm that the department will carefully consider this request [for a review of the airports national policy statement, which includes Heathrow]. “As well as giving careful consideration to the net zero report and the declaration of environment and climate emergency, mentioned in the request, it may be necessary to consider the committee on climate change’s recommended policy approach for aviation … and any relevant decisions taken by the government in the coming months as a result.” A DfT spokesperson said: “The expansion of Heathrow received overwhelming support from MPs because it would provide a massive economic boost to businesses and communities the length and breadth of Britain, all at no cost to the taxpayer and within our environmental obligations. “We take our commitment to the environment very seriously and we will give careful consideration to the net zero report. No decision has been taken to review the ANPS, however we are legally obliged to consider requests like this one.”  Last week, a case brought by Plan B and others that ministers must take the Paris climate agreement into account in considering Heathrow expansion was thrown out by the high court. Officials are also understood to believe that any decisions on the request for a review are some way off because the climate change committee will not produce its policy approach on aviation until later this year, so no decision on how to take its findings into consideration will be made until then. This means no recommendation to the secretary of state is likely until next year. Crosland responded: “The government can split hairs if they want, but the situation is too serious for that. Parliament approved Heathrow expansion on the basis of very different circumstances to those which now prevail. It’s just common sense the position calls for reconsideration. You can’t declare an emergency and then act like nothing’s changed.” The net zero report produced by the CCC was hailed as one of the biggest developments in the UK’s approach to climate change in the last decade. The recommendations will require vast changes to all aspects of the British economy, encompassing citizens, consumers, businesses, government and civil society. MPs passing the vote on a “climate emergency” also marked a historic moment in British politics, as it would, if implemented effectively, require the government to have regard for the climate in policy decisions across the board. Siân Berry, the co-leader of the Green party, said: “In this age of climate emergency, Heathrow expansion very clearly cannot go ahead. We need the government to acknowledge the emergency situation that previous policy choices have created. All building of new fossil fuel infrastructure has to end. That means banning fracking, stopping new road building and of course ending Heathrow expansion.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterI’ve often wondered why Germany remains so joined at the hip with the climate change movement when everywhere else it is collapsing. One reason may be because of the constant weak non-science-based reports like the one presented at N24 German television.
CLICK HERE TO SEE 4:40 VIDEO  (much is in English)

The video features the coastal Namib desert, which is supposed to be one of the oldest on the planet. The clip starts in German where the desert is introduced and it is claimed that its unique biodiversity is now threatened (by man-made climate change?). Because the biodiversity is highly adapted to the desert’s unique conditions, any change is all the more critical.
After 50 seconds, the video goes to English with German subtitles. Note how Joe Henschel claims that if anything there changes, then it means “something is really wrong”. The implication is that it is caused by man of course. Again it’s the unfalsifiable science of man-made climate change.
After the interview with the first man, the reporter says in German what climate change will bring for the desert, namely more storms, storm damage and erosion – and so everyone there is threatened. All the fault of man, I guess. The reporter says the Namib desert could act as an early warning system. Life forms from neighboring environments could begin invading.

50-year hockey stick
After 2 min 50 seconds, some observations are given in English by a specialist. The report I guess tries to say that any weather change in Namibia is due to global climate change, which is due to man. The man claims that the weather in the Namib desert has changed suddenly over the last couple years:
The earlier climate records only go back about 50 years, and in geological time that is a very short period. But if we do look at the records we have, we find that the climate has been relatively constant for most of the reported time. In the last few years though we have had a number of unusual events.”
This of course  is very weak science. Remember it is based on only 50 years of observation. I’m not knocking Mr Henschel, but look at how N24 spins the story.
Perhaps similar changes occurred sometime before that. As Steve Goddard points out almost daily at http://stevengoddard.wordpress.com/, many of the “unusual” events we see today also occurred back in the not so distant past – more than 50 years ago.
So if anyone has observations, data or information from the Namib desert from more than 50 years ago, Mr Henschel may be interested in them.
(Note: The above hockey stick chart is my own depiction of the Namibian climate)

"Action on climate change should make polluters pay and include compensation for people on low incomes, according to the social services sector. The Australian Council of Social Services and others have called for “at least” a 45% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 coupled with regular indexation of the energy supplement to compensate welfare recipients. Throughout the election campaign the Coalition has attacked Labor’s plan for a 45% emissions reduction target and goal of 50% renewable energy with modelling from BAEconomics claiming this would increase wholesale electricity prices by 20% and reduce wages by 3% over a decade. Bill Shorten has rejected the modelling as propaganda – in part because it did not model the benefits of mitigating climate change – and argued that inaction on climate change makes solutions more expensive. The social services climate statement, released on Friday, backs the Labor emissions reduction target as a minimum, as well as the Greens policy to end subsidies for fossil fuel production and use. The statement calls for “a credible, low-cost and equitable plan to transition to a clean economy that includes a polluter pays principle, direct government investment and targeted support” for disadvantaged groups. “Climate change is not only a threat to our environment, it threatens people’s homes, livelihoods, health, quality of life, employment and increases risks and burdens for future generations,” it said. “It is a social justice and intergenerational equity issue. Climate change hits people living on low incomes or experiencing disadvantage first and hardest.” The social services bodies called for an increase in the unemployment benefit Newstart and to include the energy supplement in welfare recipients’ base payments so it grows in line with inflation rather than remaining frozen at $4.40 a week. The Coalition attempted to limit the supplement to new welfare recipients but was forced to back down in August when the measure was blocked by the Senate. The social service sector also recommended investment in home energy efficiency and production, including mandatory energy efficiency standards for rental housing, energy efficiency and solar for social housing and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities to help lower power bills. The sector wants a climate change adaptation and resilience plans, including funding development of an Australian climate change social vulnerability map. The Coalition’s $2bn 15-year climate solutions fund would pay polluters to reduce emissions and includes a “safeguards mechanism” to limit pollution growth, although it has not spelled out how each sector will contribute to its 26% emissions reduction target."

Share this...FacebookTwitterAwhile back I sent an e-mail to the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI), who we all know provide us with the fascinating 80°+N Arctic temperature charts.
With the Arctic being a crucial indicator of global warming, so we are told, I thought surely they must also have a plot of the annual 80°+N mean temperatures. Astonishingly they wrote back and said they don’t – but sent me the data and said I was welcome to have a go at it.
Ed Caryl volunteered to crunch the numbers and to do a little extra digging on the side. Here’s what he came up with.
====================================================
+80°North
 by Ed Caryl
Since 1958 the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI) has been reporting temperatures above 80° North, the North pole and environs, using a gridded model, but basing the data on all available temperature measurements in the area. Pierre obtained all the daily data since 1958 from DMI, and asked me to reduce it to an annual mean temperature plot. Figure 1 is the result.

Figure 1: The annual temperature anomaly for the Arctic above 80° north. From DMI data.
One observes that since 1958 the annual average mean temperature has varied across a range 1.5° C wide, until 2005, when it warmed by just over 2°C above the long term average. One then asks, why?
Figure 2, the Dipole Anomaly in June 2010. —Credit: National Snow and Ice Data Center courtesy NOAA/ESRL Physical Sciences Division
The first suspect named by the warmists is a phenomenon called the Arctic Dipole Anomaly. The dipole is high pressure over the Arctic regions on North America, the Beaufort Sea, and low pressure over the Asian Arctic, the Kara Sea. This causes winds from the south along the Siberian coast, pushing ice to the north, and north winds in the Fram Strait, pushing ice out of the Arctic and into North Atlantic. See Figure 2 for the conditions in June 2010. The reduced ice cover has resulted in higher annual temperatures. Many writers echo a claim that this pattern is new, and not seen prior to 1990, blaming it on “climate change”.
The Dipole Anomaly was only noticed this last decade, but I suspect that the phenomenon has been happening all along as a part of the regular AMO and NAO cycles, it is just that there was not sufficient instrumentation in the high arctic to bring it to notice, especially during previous warm periods in the 1920s and 30s. But there were measurements made at a few locations, and many ship logs, and written discussions of these earlier times. But those have been forgotten or ignored by present-day researchers. The failure to recognize and investigate the cyclic nature of nature, especially the interactions of cycles tens and hundreds of years long, has been the failure that has spawned the modern hysteria about “climate change.” (Please excuse the digression.)
The warmest year for most Arctic stations is 1938. Figure 3 is from A Light In Siberia, showing the average of isolated stations in the high Arctic rim, most of them on the coast of Siberia. These temperature records just catch the edge of the 1920 temperature rise.

Figure 3: The average temperature of 9 high Arctic weather stations.
Figure 3 also shows a rapid warming from 1935 to 1938, as well as the recent warming from 2004 to 2007, just like the DMI measurements. The same phenomenon is likely the cause of the temperature rises then and now. This reference was found here:
See: Overland, J.E. (2005) and Muyin Wang; ‘The third Arctic climate pattern: 1930s and early 2000s’, when saying: “The period from 1928–1935 also had a dipole structure in SLP, which contributed to the interdecadal arctic-wide warm temperature anomalies in the first half of the 20th century.”
So much for the Arctic Dipole being new.

“Meridional flows” from the north at Spitzbergen (Svalbard) are also mentioned in that reference. These are a result of an Arctic Dipole. They also write of an average annual increase of shipping access to the island from 94 days to 157 days over the period from 1918 to 1939. The year with the most southern sea ice was 1917, with no access to Spitsbergen’s coast. But there was a great warming in the interval from 1917 to 1922. The following was published in the journal Monthly Weather Review October 10, 1922 (emphasis added).
Dr. Hoel, who has just returned, reports the location of hitherto unknown coal deposits on the eastern shores of Advent Bay – deposits of vast extent and superior quality……The oceanographic observations have, however, been even more interesting. Ice conditions were exceptional. In fact, so little ice has never before been noted. The expedition all but established a record, sailing as far north as 81o29′ in ice-free water. This is the farthest north ever reached with modern oceanographic apparatus…..
“In connection with Dr. Hoel’s report, it is of interest to note the unusually warm summer in Arctic Norway and the observations of Capt. Martin Ingebrigtsen, who has sailed the eastern Arctic for 54 years past. He says that he first noted warmer conditions in 1918, that since that time it has steadily gotten warmer, and that to-day the Arctic of that region is not recognizable as the same region of 1868 to 1917.
“Many old landmarks are so changed as to be unrecognisable. Where formerly great masses of ice were found, there are now often moraines, accumulations of earth and stones. At many points where glaciers formerly extended far into the sea they have entirely disappeared.
“The change in temperature, says Captain Ingebrigtsen, has also brought about great change in the flora and fauna of the Arctic. This summer he sought for white fish in Spitsbergen waters. Formerly great shoals of them were found there. This year he saw none, although he visited all the old fishing grounds.
“There were few seal in Spitzbergen waters this year, the catch being far under the average. This, however, did not surprise the captain. He pointed out that formerly the waters about Spitzbergen held an even summer temperature of about 3o Celsius; this year recorded temperatures up to 15o, and last winter the ocean did not freeze over even on the north coast of Spitsbergen.”
Here is a chart (Figure 4) of the winter warming at Spitsbergen. The chart begins at 1912, so the full extent of the warming is shown. There was over 10° C of warming in winter from the 1910’s to the 1930’s.

Figure 4: Winter temperature (December, January, and February) at Isfjord Radio weather station, Svalbard/Spitsbergen. Data from GISS.

Figure 5: +80° North Winter temperatures (in degrees Kelvin, as reported by DMI). This is also from DMI data. The bold line is the average of the monthly figures, and is charted in the December year. One more year is shown over Figure 1 because we have full data from last winter through February.
Any warming in the far north is mostly seen in the winter. Note that the winter warming in Figure 5 is more than twice the annual warming seen in Figure 1 in the same period. But also note that the current warming at +80° North is less than half the warming that was seen at Spitsbergen (Figure 4) in the early 1900’s. Figure 6 shows the modern warming at Jan Mayen, Svalbard airport and Bear Island. The modern and the 70’s warming is not nearly as dramatic as that in the early 20th Century, and that happened without the assistance of CO2.

So what caused the warming, then and now? One answer, found here (Sergei Rodionov, Climate Logic), is that a shift to the east in the position of the Icelandic low, into Siberia, becoming the “Arctic dipole,” is responsible. This along with a high NAO index, a rising AMO, and ocean currents, makes the Barents Sea warmer than normal. Will this continue? S. Rodionov predicts that the warming will end in 2012, and a cooling trend will last until 2023. The short-term trend is already down. In Figure 5, the warmest winter was 2008. In Svalbard, Jan Mayen, and Bear Island, the downturn began earlier, in 2006. See Figure 6. I strongly recommend reading Rodionov’s article, which goes into great detail.
In the 1920’s the AMO was rising sharply, (see Figure 7) encouraging a dramatic temperature rise in the high Arctic, while currently the AMO is near or past it’s peak, stopping the temperature rise. The 1970’s cooling and warming tracked the AMO. This is all cycles. From the sun to the oceans, some cycles are long, like the Dansgaard/Oeschger
and Bond events, some are irregular like the ENSO cycles, some are tens of years long and regular, like the AMO cycle, some are short and regular like the sun. The sun also has
several long cycles. When these cycles get “in phase,” all encouraging heating or cooling at once, strange things can happen. (For more on Bond Events, google Bond Events Chiefio. He has some very interesting things to say.)

"Renee Blackman runs a health service covering a vast chunk of north-west Queensland – about 640,000 sq km, an area larger than Spain – that provides services to about 7,000 Aboriginal people in communities from Mount Isa to the Gulf. While the cultures and circumstances of these communities are diverse, Blackman says they share a common health threat: that the harmful impacts of poverty are magnified in remote locations.  Blackman, a Gubbi Gubbi woman and CEO of an Aboriginal community-controlled health service Gidgee Healing, sees poverty contributing to poor health in remote communities in many ways. People cannot afford healthy foods, to access or maintain housing, to buy vital medications, or to travel to regional centres such as Cairns or Townsville for surgery that would help them or their children, she says. But mostly, she says, poverty means people have more pressing priorities than whether their diabetes is being well controlled. “None of that matters if the priority is to put food on the table first, or a roof over the table,” she says. “Worrying about medication or a specialist appointment or an allied health wraparound service isn’t a priority.” Blackman says she gets really frustrated when health groups put out simplistic messages for people to eat more fresh fruit and vegetables. It reminds her that so much health debate is far removed from the realities of people living in poverty. Likewise, there is also a disconnect between much of the mainstream debate about health, which tends to focus on funding of medical services and hospitals, and the evidence about what matters most for people’s health. The Western Australian government’s recent Sustainable Health Review cites US research suggesting that only 16% of a person’s overall health and wellbeing relates to clinical care and the biggest gains, especially for those at greatest risk of poor health, come from action on the social determinants of health. These are “the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age”, and are shaped by the distribution of money, power and resources. In the case of Gidgee Healing’s clients, the determinants of health include the ongoing legacy of colonisation, such as poverty and racism, as well as protective factors such as connection to culture and country. Tackling the social determinants of health is critical to address health inequities, which arise because people with the least social and economic power tend to have the worst health, live in unhealthier environments and have worse access to healthcare. A study cited in the last two editions of Australia’s Health (in 2016 and 2018) estimates that if action were taken on the social determinants to close the health gap between the most and least disadvantaged Australians, half a million people could be spared chronic illness, $2.3bn in annual hospital costs saved and pharmaceutical benefits scheme prescriptions cut by 5.3 million. Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services have a long history of working holistically and innovatively to address the wider determinants of health, and Gidgee Healing incorporates legal services, knowing that legal concerns “cause a lot of worry for families”, Blackman says. However, many of the levers for addressing the determinants of health lie outside of the health sector’s control. For example, Blackman’s vision for what would help Gidgee Healing clients includes increases to Newstart and other social security payments, with a loading for remoteness. She would also like to see better access to education and training for remote communities, many of which do not have high schools. As well, Blackman would like a “whole of government” approach to addressing the social determinants of health, as was recommended in 2008 by the World Health Organisation commission on social determinants of health. In the absence of such action, she says Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services have to work hard and be creative in the face of government silos in their efforts to provide holistic services. Blackman’s job is challenging enough at the best of times. But climate change and extreme weather events, such as recent flooding that cut road access to many remote communities for several weeks, are making it ever-more difficult. “You have got these massive weather events sweeping through our communities, decimating structures, infrastructure – which means health services,” she says. “If your health service is down, you can’t provide any type of healthcare; it’s almost like you are operating under war conditions sometimes, because things get totally obliterated and you have got to build back from scratch, yet you’ve got people who need your assistance.” Blackman and many other health professionals are seeing the impact of a perfect storm threatening the health of some of Australia’s most disadvantaged communities. Climate change is exacerbating the social and economic inequalities that already contribute to profound health inequities. Blackman describes elderly Aboriginal people with multiple health problems stuck in inadequate housing without air-conditioning during increasingly frequent extreme heatwaves. Sometimes it is so hot, she says, the bitumen melts, making it difficult for her health teams to reach communities in times of high need. As well, patients are presenting to Gidgee Healing clinics with conditions such as dehydration that might be preventable if they could afford their power bills and had appropriate housing. The mental health impacts are also huge, Blackman says, mentioning the deaths of hundreds of thousands of livestock during the floods. “This is devastation, this is loss, this is grief, we are already facing a suicide crisis in the north-west across all of the community, including the Aboriginal community,” she says. “You’re talking about a region that already has depleted access to mental health professionals.” Hurricane Katrina is often held up as a textbook example of how climate change hits poor people hardest, and not only because the poorest areas in New Orleans were worst affected by flooding. Much of the planning and emergency response catered to the better off – those with cars and the means to safely evacuate and arrange alternative accommodation. As Sharon Friel, professor of health equity at the Australian National University, outlines in a new book, Climate Change and the People’s Health, most of those who died because of Hurricane Katrina came from disadvantaged populations. These were also the groups that suffered most in the aftermath, as a result of damage to infrastructure and loss of livelihoods. “It was also lower-income groups, and in particular children and the elderly, who were at increased risk of developing severe mental health symptoms compared with their peers in higher income groups,” Friel writes. It is not only the direct and indirect impacts of climate change that worsen health inequities; policies to address climate change can have unintended consequences. Friel cites international evidence that the distribution of green spaces in cities to promote urban cooling and health tends to benefit mainly white and affluent communities. Friel’s book outlines myriad ways in which climate change interacts with other social determinants of health to create a multiplier effect that deepens and compounds health inequities. Yet policymakers have been slow to respond, although such concerns were clearly identified more than a decade ago, in the landmark WHO report on the social determinants of health, which said it was important to bring together “the two agendas of health equity and climate change”. While Friel says the relationships between climate change and health inequity are “messy and complex”, she argues that understanding there are common determinants of both problems provides an opportunity to “kill two birds with one stone”. Friel calls for intersectoral action, with a focus on equality, environmental sustainability and health equity, to tackle the underlying “consumptagenic system” that drives both problems. This system is “a network of policies, processes and modes of understanding and governance that fuels unhealthy, inequitable and environmentally destructive production and consumption”. In Victoria, a large community health service provider called Cohealth has had processes in place for at least five years to work with at-risk groups during extreme weather events, in recognition of the need to address climate change as a health threat, especially for disadvantaged populations. During heatwaves, the service checks on homeless people, public housing residents and people with mental illnesses to ensure they can take steps to stay safe. “The growing frustration of people in the health sector is, this work is eating into our budgets, it’s occupying the time of our staff – and yet there is little or no policy recognition of the way health resources are being taken to address these problems,” says Cohealth chief executive, Lyn Morgain. She adds that local governments and service providers have been left to carry an unfair burden due to inaction on climate and health by governments, especially the federal government. Morgain, who is also chair of the Social Determinants of Health Alliance and a former board member of the Australian Council of Social Service, notes that Acoss has been championing the need to apply an equity lens to climate policy, to assess whether new policy proposals across a range of portfolios advantage or disadvantage low-income households. Kellie Caught, senior advisor on climate and energy at Acoss, is calling for the next federal government to invest in vulnerability mapping to identify communities most at risk from climate change, in order to support development of local climate adaptation and resilience plans. Governments also need to invest in building the resilience of community organisations such as those providing disability, aged care, meals on wheels and services for homeless people, to ensure they have the capacity to undertake disaster management and resilience planning, and continue operating through extreme weather events, she says. Acoss is advocating for mandatory energy-efficiency standards for all rental properties, for state and federal governments to invest in upgrading energy efficiency and production in all social and community housing, and for a fund to help low-income earners such as pensioners upgrade their homes’ energy efficiency, as well as programs for remote and Indigenous communities. It is more than a decade since policymakers were presented with evidence showing that such measures bring concrete health benefits for low-income households. A widely cited randomised trial, published in 2007 in the BMJ, found that insulating low-income households in New Zealand led to a significantly warmer, drier indoor environment, and resulted in significant improvements in health and comfort, a lower risk of children having time off school or adults having sick days off work, and a trend for fewer hospital admissions for respiratory conditions. “Interventions of this kind, which focus on low-income communities and poorer quality housing, have the potential to reduce health inequalities,” found the researchers. The health of people in Burnie in north-west Tasmania is shaped by rates of poverty, unemployment and poor educational outcomes that are worse than the state’s average. At the public hospital, emergency physician Dr Melinda Venn is reminded every day how people who are poorer and sicker have difficulty accessing the services they need. She describes seeing patients who struggle to feed their families, or buy medications and who often can’t afford to put petrol in their cars to get to the doctor. Her prescription for what would help her community’s health and wellbeing is similar to Renee Blackman’s in north-west Queensland. It includes wide-ranging action to address poverty, including through raising the Newstart allowance and more generally ensuring liveable incomes, as well as access to affordable fresh food, public transport and higher education. Venn also stresses the importance of better funding for preventative health measures and primary healthcare. “Every day we see people come to the emergency department, either because they can’t afford to get into the GP or they can’t get into the GP,” she says. Dr Nick Towle, a medical educator at the University of Tasmania who helped organise a recent Doctors for the Environment Australia conference in Hobart, where delegates declared a climate emergency, says that addressing the intertwined issues of health inequities and climate change will require massive transformation in how governments operate. They must move beyond the current siloed approaches whereby, for example, the housing portfolio can be reluctant to invest in improving housing if savings are to the health portfolio. Towle says a systems approach would reimagine urban development so that communities are within cycling or walking distance of local food production, green spaces and infrastructure such as shops, primary healthcare and aged care centres, and with active and passive solar a requirement for all new developments. Like Venn, Towle stresses the need to invest far more in primary healthcare and the prevention of chronic conditions such as obesity, diabetes, lung and cardiac disease, which are more common in poorer communities, and make people less resilient to the effects of heat, which he says “is emerging as a big silent killer”. Back in Mount Isa, Renee Blackman stresses the importance of local action in responding to both health inequities and climate change. Local governments, especially Indigenous local governments, should be given more support for tackling these issues, she says.  “At least talk to the people it’s going to affect,” she says. “As an Aboriginal organisation, we would never tread on someone else’s Country, without first asking, what do you need?” An assessment of the major parties’ track records and election promises shows Australia has a better chance of acting on poverty and climate change as critical health equity concerns if there is a change of government. The Acoss’s election policy tracker suggests the Greens have the best policies for addressing poverty and climate change, while the Climate and Health Alliance scorecard gives the Greens top marks (8 out of 8), followed by Labor (4.5 out of 8) and the LNP (zero out of 8). The Consumers Health Forum of Australia scorecard gives the Greens’ health policies the highest rating (21 out of a potential score of 37), followed by Labor (16/37) and the LNP (7/7). The Public Health Association of Australia has welcomed Labor’s and the Greens’ commitments on preventative health, while the Australian Health Care Reform Alliance has called on both major parties “to follow the lead of the Greens and commit to health policies that deliver both equity and efficiency”. Like many, the Consumers Health Forum is disappointed in the lack of focus on primary healthcare, saying “the absence of a transformational agenda for primary care is a missed opportunity this election”. Meanwhile, the Australian Healthcare and Hospitals Association scorecard records the Liberal National party as having no explicit commitment to health equity and, days out from an election, the Rural Doctors Association of Australia says the Greens are the only party to have addressed rural health issues so far. Some health organisations have not yet released an election scorecard. Reporting in this series is supported by VivCourt through the Guardian Civic Journalism Trust"
"News Corp Australia has triggered a rare moment of unity in the fractious 2019 federal election. Representatives from the Liberals to the Greens, appearing on Monday night’s Q&A on the ABC, hopped into the media giant over its coverage of Bill Shorten and his speech referencing his mother’s life story. Last week the Daily Telegraph criticised Shorten on its front page for what it said was a deliberate omission that she had become a barrister late in life. The Labor leader had spoken on Q&A about how his mother, Ann, had been thwarted in her early ambition to study law and instead took a teaching scholarship. The Liberal’s campaign spokesman, Simon Birmingham, said the story “should not have been written and should not have been published”. “Bill dealt with it,” he said. “Scott dealt with it. I think in terms of media commentary and the way the media runs, Australia’s a country with a free media, [people] are free to choose not to read a newspaper that they think is biased, just as they’re free not to watch a television program that they think is biased.” But the Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, went a step further. “News Corp is a malignant influence on our democracy,” he said to applause. How would a Labor government handle a hostile Murdoch press intent on undermining its policies? #QandA pic.twitter.com/bx0YTS4iiW “They’re not a media outlet. They’re the propaganda arm of the hard right of the Liberal party and becoming increasingly hysterical. They incubate hate. And the question really is what do we do about it?” His answer? To strengthen the regulator and give more money to the ABC, a move predictably greeted by applause from the ABC audience. But most of the last Q&A before this weekend’s federal election was taken up with a largely respectful debate about climate change and whether the Coalition had done enough to reverse global warming, which Di Natale said was putting the human race in danger. Birmingham insisted that the Coalition would meet or exceed the Kyoto targets that Australia signed up to. Labor’s deputy leader, Tanya Plibersek, emphasised the need to take “real action” towards the international commitments on climate change. “We have said we will have a climate change ambassador who would work with the South Pacific in particular,” she said. Helen Haines, the independent standing in the Victorian seat of Indi, linked it to the problems of the Murray-Darling basin and said rural people were prepared to make sacrifices to achieve a transition to an economy that addressed climate change. Di Natale predicted that the Greens candidate Julian Burnside would win in the plum Liberal seat of Kooyong because the Liberal vote had collapsed. “The PM of the country brings a lump of coal into the parliament and waves it around,” he said. “It was an embarrassment. An international embarrassment.  “And the Liberal party, you vote for the Liberal party, you’re voting for the destruction of the Great Barrier Reef, the collapse of the Murray-Darling basin, more floods and more fires.” What will the panel do to address the impact of climate change and water scarcity, particularly in rural areas? #QandA pic.twitter.com/bbXvZCevH6 He also said the Greens were closing in on Higgins and could snatch it from the Liberals. The program canvassed how the Liberals’ policy to lower first homebuyers’ deposits to 5% would work. “The government will be a mortgage insurer?” asked Tony Jones, the presenter. “Essentially. That’s right,” Birmingham replied. “It’s about making sure rather than young people having to spend years extra paying rent and trying to still save, they’re able to get that first rung on the ladder of owning a home. They’re able to start paying their mortgage rather than paying rent. And build equity in their property. It sits alongside other things that we have done as a government, such as the utilisation of superannuation accounts.” Labor has immediately said it would match the policy, though it is now coming in for criticism from economists who warn that the plan could potentially push up house prices and trap young homebuyers with unsupportable levels of debt and negative equity should the housing market continue to fall. Birmingham said it would be up to the banks to ensure people did not get in over their heads. “In the end the same standards apply that banks are currently applying in terms of analysing the income, spending, saving habits and value of the property somebody is purchasing,” he said. “It’s about bringing forward that transaction potentially by years which can make a huge difference for young people.” Birmingham appeared to acknowledge that no modelling had been done before the policy was announced but said the government “had looked at the lived experience of NZ, which has had the policy in place for 10 years.” Plibersek said Labor was supporting it because it would make a modest difference to first homebuyers. But she said Labor’s policies on abolishing negative gearing on future investments in existing property would have the biggest impact on levelling the playing field for them. “Joe Hockey said get a better job,” she said. “Malcolm Turnbull said get rich parents and now, six days out from an election, Scott Morrison says, ‘I’ve got all the answers with this new scheme.’” Only the Greens said they saw risks in the policy. Di Natale agreed with Labor that negative gearing was the real issue but warned the low deposit measure could lead young people into taking loans they could not afford. “It’s not a sensible idea and I am disappointed that Labor has backed it in,” he said. The representatives of both major parties also struggled with questions about Newstart. Plibersek acknowledged in response to an audience question that she could not live on $39 a day and said Labor would review the payment. But Birmingham accused Labor of trying to give impression it would increase Newstart when it hadn’t actually budgeted for it. “You sound like you’re in opposition,” Jones said as he pressed for Birmingham to say what the Coalition would do. Di Natale drew wild applause when he said: “It is completely unacceptable in a county like Australia.” Haines agreed and promised that if elected she would work from the crossbenches to address the level of Newstart."

The cold of global warming. (Photo: NOAA)
2011 third coldest year of the decade.
First 2011 happens to have been the third coldest year in the last decade, according to satellite measurements and John Christy of the University of Alabama.
Globally averaged, Earth’s atmosphere was 0.15 C (0.27 degree Fahrenheit) warmer than the 30-year average in 2011; That was less than half of the warming anomaly seen in 2010.”
USA was a full degree cooler than in 1999!
With constant nail-biting over warming, the media are obviously disconnected from reality, as data from the NOAA show that 2011 was cooler than 1999 and cooler than some of the years in the 1980s. Bastardi writes:
Despite claims that it continues to get warmer and warmer, this table from NOAA/NCDC indicates that 2011 was in the middle of the pack, going all the way back to 1980 (the start of the “global warming era”). Such remote years as 1981, 1986, 1987, and 1990 were hotter.”

"Labour have announced plans to fit solar panels to 1.75m homes lived in by socially housed or low-income households as part of its promised “green industrial revolution” to try to combat climate change and boost jobs. The programme is due to be announced by Jeremy Corbyn and the shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, at an event in Yorkshire on Thursday. It would involve solar panels being fitted to a million social homes as part of scheduled updates to social housing. Labour said this would provide enough power to give them free energy, saving an average of £117 a year on bills. Any spare power would be put into the national grid. Another 750,000 low-income households would have the chance to have the panels fitted through interest-free loans or grants. The partyestimated the policy would create 16,900 jobs and save 7.1m tonnes of CO2 a year, equivalent to taking 4m cars off the roads. It comes after Labour’s pledge in February to introduce a wider set of policies to simultaneously tackle the climate crisis and create large numbers of high-skilled jobs in the green economy. The idea echoes the green new deal proposed by leftwing Democrats in the US, and proposals put forward by the Green party in the UK. As part of the Labour plan, the party has committed to making sure at least 60% of the UK’s electricity and heat comes from renewable sources by 2030. The plan will involve what Labour calls a “just transition”, allowing people currently working in carbon-emitting industries to move into skilled green jobs. Corbyn said: “In this country, too often people are made to feel like the cost of saving the planet falls on them. Too many think of green measures as just another way for companies or the government to get money out of them, while the rich fly about in private jets and heat their empty mansions.” He claimed Labour’s green industrial revolution “will benefit working-class people with cheaper energy bills, more rewarding well-paid jobs and new industries to revive the parts of our country that have been held back for far too long”. Corbyn added: “By focusing on low-income households we will reduce fuel poverty and increase support for renewable energy. Social justice and climate justice as one. Environmental destruction and inequality not only can, but must be tackled at the same time.”"
"John Oliver has turned his focus to climate change in an urgent new episode of Last Week Tonight, referring to the situation as “critical”.   Oliver started his monologue by poking fun at the recycling ideas people present when it comes to saving the planet but then quickly took a serious turn. “These days, we’re inundated with new terrifying headlines on a regular basis,” he told his audience, citing the UN landmark study which stated that if carbon emissions remained steady, catastrophic environmental events will not only be inevitable but also more frequent. Oliver then narrowed his scope to dissect the Green New Deal, the non-binding resolution put forth by Congress newcomer Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. “If you know nothing else about the Green New Deal, you now know that’s everyone’s talking about it and it was booed at a Trump rally, therefore it is a. famous and b. probably good.” He also mentioned that the Senate voted the Green New Deal down six weeks ago but that it is still at the forefront because of the bad press surrounding it, mostly from Republicans and conservative media. Conservative media have attacked the Green New Deal, claiming it wants to eliminate cows and airplane travel. Oliver clarified that these ideas do not appear in the brief legislation: “The whole Green New Deal is just 14 pages long. That is seven pages shorter than the menu for the Cheesecake Factory.” What the Green New Deal does do, however, is set out aggressive goals such as achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, meeting 100% of the country’s power demand through renewable energy, and creating millions of new jobs. Conservatives have been attacking it because of jokes put forth in an early press release, a mistake acknowledged by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Even so, Oliver corrected the idea of where cow methane comes from: “Most cow methane comes from them belching, not farting, and if you only remember one fact from tonight’s show, please don’t let it be that one.” Although there are many solutions to the problem of climate change, Oliver chose to focus on carbon pricing to let his audience “watch the rerun of Game of Thrones, so that you can see what garbage from craft services they’ve hidden as an Easter egg this week!” The host tried to impress upon his audience the severity of carbon: “The current situation of carbon is critical. Carbon emissions are, by far, the largest source of greenhouse gases. Yet, right now, it’s basically free to pollute the air with carbon dioxide …” He then noted this was strange: “We’ve universally agreed that polluting is bad and yet, it’s free to do it. When you litter, you pay a fine. When you drive above the speed limit, you pay a fine. When you steal 400 hamsters from PetSmart, tie them to a sled and race through the streets on a hamster sleigh, you pay a fine. Is that fine worth it? Of course it is! But you do pay it!” Oliver the discussed two ways that carbon pricing could be introduced: cap and trade or carbon tax. For the latter, “the problem there is mostly the word tax which has become a dirty word in politics”. He chose Canada’s carbon tax rollout as an example, where the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, slipped and called it a tax to conservative boos from his parliament. “If you’re a politician, you just can’t say the word ‘tax’ in the same way that if you’re an actor, you can’t say the word ‘Macbeth’, and if you’re president of the United States, you can’t say the word ‘origins’,” said Oliver, poking fun at Trump’s difficulty with a simple word. In response to Trudeau’s ‘tax’ slip-up, one Canadian conservative came forth with poetic rebuttal, in an attempt to repudiate the pricing, to which Oliver deadpanned: “Fire.” “Look, I don’t care where you stand on this issue, no one wants to hear a rhyme about carbon taxes from anybody, let alone some guy who looks like he got his entire wardrobe from Express John Oliver.” But he acknowledged the fight for carbon pricing was hard in Canada and in the United States, the last time it was on the table 10 years ago, Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia took a rifle bullet to the legislation in a video. “That may seem idiotic to you because it is,” joked Oliver. “The Green New Deal has succeeded in getting people talking but that won’t mean anything unless that talk now turns to actions and putting a price on carbon could potentially be one of them, although, let me reiterate it will not be enough on its own by a long shot. We’re gonna need a lot of different policies working in tandem and we have to take action right now,” said Oliver."

How Do The AGW People Get Away With This?
by Joe Bastardi
A few graphics make the position of the AGW people completely absurd. It’s why I am so confident as to my position on this matter, and by the way it does have something to do with the weather because if you know where the weather has been, you have a better chance to know where it’s going.
Exhibit one, from my co-partner here at WeatherBell Joe D Aleo ( I wonder if we will share the same cell when the warmingistas come to get us. And will they let us have the same tattoo artist to brand us deniers?)

PDO and AMO are strongly correlated to the earths temps…now watch CO2 vs temps over the past century:

Even more damming than this, look at the past 10 years:

Or the last 15 years:

Which leads to the question: How do these people have any credibility? How do they get away with this?  It’s mind boggling that its gotten to a point where the EPA is dictating policy based on what is an obvious fraud, or if you want to be gentle about it, creates enough doubt to back off.
Here is something to consider.
Over a year ago I advised a client of mine at the time to purchase less air conditioners than for  2010 because the summer of 2011 would be cooler than the summer of 2010. Now there is talk that this is going to turn out like last summer, but assuming it won’t, the forecast was made. BEFORE LAST SUMMER. The client had to put in their order for air conditioners a year beforehand because they were ordering them FROM CHINA.
Now every red blooded American gets up in arms because all those jobs should be here in USA, right?  But why aren’t they? Well  in large part because of policy that is based on absurdities like this, a factory making anything here is now being clamped down on by the EPA so hard, so why bother? Its like Obama said:  ” So, if somebody wants to  build a coal plant, they can, it’s just that it will bankrupt them because they are going to be charged a huge sum for all the greenhouse gas that will get emitted”.
That is a direct quote and is like his energy Sec saying that they seek to take away choices that people waste their money on. Astounding that things like that are being pushed by people in control,  or that they even got control in the first place. That is our fault, based on what is obviously flat out nonsense. But combine that with labor costs, and the fact the that the corporate tax rate in the US is higher than China, which few people in our nation seem to get, and this is what happens.
Now let’s say we wanted to make sure that a person here working in an air conditioner factory can make a decent wage from a helping hand ( how do like my populist line…from the Ghost of Tom Joad?)  Well, get rid of the EPA  running roughshod over factory owners, and lower the corporate tax rate to below China’s  ( it is so hard to believe that Chinese tax rates are lower) and you will find that companies will stay here and pay a decent wage to build air conditioners, But not if you are clamping down on people based on questionable, don’t-have-a-leg-to-stand-on ideas about co2 warming the planet.
Again, it defies logic as to how they got to where they did with this issue, and the facts are there for all to see.

"A few days before the United Nations released a report warning that 1 million species, including 40% of all amphibians, could become extinct within decades, staff from Melbourne zoo were nursing chilled containers of frogs’ eggs to be taken to remote areas of sphagnum bog in the Mt Kosciuszko national park. The containers held 1,673 fertilised eggs of the critically endangered southern corroboree frog, a species near the top of Australia’s extinction watchlist. The eggs were packed into sphagnum moss for transport. Half were placed in one of 22 special disease-free areas that had been cleared of chytrid fungus, which is responsible for wiping out much of the wild population. The other half were placed in protected tubs in the wild, out of which the tadpoles will be able to climb once the eggs metamorphose. That will not happen until spring. The tadpoles, which come out of their eggs as soon as they are released into the water, will spend the cold winter months nestled into the moss beneath a layer of snow and ice. It has been a record breeding season for the zoo, and the largest release of eggs since the program began in 2001. In collaboration with Sydney’s Taronga zoo and Healesville sanctuary about 3,000 southern corroboree frogs have been released this year. Melbourne zoo has a breeding population of about 50 male frogs and 70 females, the oldest of which was captured as a tadpole in Kosciusko in 1999. For the past several weeks of the breeding season, carers at the zoo have been gathering the clear eggs and chilling them to slow down their development so they can be released together. “We use the sophisticated equipment of a wine chiller to keep them at a temperature of 8C,” the amphibian supervisor Damian Goodall says. “It’s a lot easier to transport them as eggs than as tadpoles.” Tadpoles, he says, need to be “carried in bags, like fish” which is not conducive to either bumpy 4WD travel or being dropped via helicopter. The release into the water mimics the natural process of water rising in the bogs at the end of summer, Goodall says, so the eggs often begin to hatch as soon as they are released. Conservationists who monitor the site in spring say they have heard the calls of male corroboree frogs in areas where the tadpoles had been released, and which had been bare of wild frogs for years. “If we weren’t doing any of these releases, pretty much this species would be extinct, because a lot of the more crowded sites where there used to be huge communities now don’t have any males calling,” Goodall says. He says the wild population of the southern corroboree frog, the closely related northern corroboree frog and the Baw Baw frog plummeted following bushfires about 15 years ago that burned out their habitat. All three critically endangered species were then crowded out of their traditional habitat by the smooth toadlet, an abundant native species that carries the deadly chytrid fungus. The three frog species are on a list of 21 priority native species for Zoos Victoria, 16 of which are subject to a captive breeding program. All but four are Victorian natives; the others are priority national species such as the Tasmanian devil and Lord Howe Island phasmid. Dr Marissa Parrott, a reproductive biologist, says Zoos Victoria has made a commitment that no Victorian terrestrial vertebrates will go extinct on its watch. “The UN report is terrifying but it’s not going to change what we are doing because we are already there,” Parrott says. “We already know how bad the situation is and we are already fighting extinction for these species that are on the brink.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterWith the book out 6 days, parts of the the German mainstream media and green activists are finding the the whole affair really tough to digest. Some of the reactions have been downright nasty and Medieval.
The left wing German online TAZ here has a weekend article called “Climate Skeptics Are Like Viruses“, which looks at the controversy swirling about Vahrenholt’s and Lüning’s new skeptic book “Die kalte Sonne“.
TAZ’s message is clear: In climate science, scientific scrutiny and enquiry are mental disorders coming from viruses. We all know what needs to be done with viruses.
IPCC lead author: skeptics no longer need to be heard!
In the TAZ piece, IPCC lead author Petra Döll is quoted as saying that skeptics don’t need to be heard. Lüning and Vahrenholt respond at their Die kalte Sonne site:
The attitude of refusal by the IPCC with respect to open scientific discussion and debate is now conspicuous. This is demomstrated by IPCC lead author Dr. Petra Döll in the German online taz in claiming that “climate skeptics” no longer need to be heard. Indeed it is questionable just how long this weird scientific approach can be maintained. Should we not expect a professional demeanor from scientists who are paid and supported by German tax revenue? Döll’s dubious reasoning: The climate skeptics ”just keep repeating the same arguments”.  Could it be that the so-called climate skeptics are forced to keep repeating because the current climate science establishment has yet to provide a satisfactory answer? There’s a lot that indicates this is the case. An assessment of the media one week after the launch of the book “Die kalte Sonne” has clearly shown: The media are relying on a hand-full of prominent experts whose arguments are showing to be everything but scientifically convincing. The statements of many experts and activist editors are characterized by misrepresentations, intentional omissions and errors.
Politicians have become aware of this problem. SPD socialist party Chairman writes in the the Sunday edition of the TAZ sonntaz that in all cases we have to hear the climate skeptics out, ‘and even if it is sometimes very difficult to do so.’ Perhaps he’s beginning to realize that something is amiss within the IPCC. Politicians have blindly relied on the IPCC for too long. Whatever the IPCC said, was law. When one considers how high the stakes really are in the climate debate, then one has to conclude that an independent review of the IPCC’s basic assumptions is essential, even just for the sake of transparency reasons. To avoid conflicts of interest, such a review should be conducted by neutral parties who are not involved in the climate debate. Of course this should be done by scientists, but the more they are from outside of climate science, the better. Climate science is not rocket science. An independent review by a commission is possible with independent scientists. In the event members come from a large research facility, then it must be assured that there is no sister institute that is dependent on climate science funding. The most important tool of such a commission is natural science common sense, which has been increasingly missing in the climate sciences over the last years.”

That’s a reasonable response. A commission to conduct a review of the IPCC is long overdue, as it is well-documented that the IPCC house is a mess.
But scrutinizing science is mentally ill – the TAZ wants to tell us
There’s another part of the TAZ report, which Lüning and Vahrenolt did not respond to (probably because of its sheer absurdity). Here’s what the end-of-the-world-obsessed TAZ adds:
Also psychologist Marius Raab asks that climate skeptics be listened to. Their ‘house of thoughts’ in the end fulfill many criteria for conspiracy theories, which Raab studies at the University of Bamberg. ‘A conspiracy theory is foremost a good story,’ he wrote to the sonntaz, “in structure and argumentation it is especially compelling and holds the invitation to get involved and thus to spread the word. Argumentation is one-sided, not scientific.'”
Reminds me of the old Soviet tactic of admitting political opponents to mental institutions in order to eliminate them. With the TAZ’s “virus” remark and adding the comments from shrink Raab, it’s clear that the TAZ has no interest in arguing the science and is perfectly content to engage in gutter journalism.
Finally, here’s an objective radio report (in German) Inforadio rbb on the book “Die kalte Sonne” .

"Jonathan Freedland (The secret to stopping Brexit: keep it simple, 11 May) refers to the urgency of climate change and points out, correctly, that this situation “cries out for cooperation with our neighbours”. But his logic is adrift when he links this with his wish for continued British membership of the EU. Firstly, such cooperation could happen via one of the other Europe-wide bodies of which the UK is a member, or via an intergovernmental group specific to that problem; there is no need for it to happen through the EU specifically or any such top-down supranational body.  Secondly, some of the EU’s core policies, such as economic growth and expanded continent-wide trading, are simply incompatible with what’s needed to stop the destruction of our ecosystem. There’s nothing inconsistent about supporting more urgent cooperation between neighbouring countries while opposing the principles and the policies of the EU – which is merely one particular political manifestation of such cooperative ideals, and a rather misguided one at that.Albert BealeLondon • Overfishing and damaging catch methods are the greatest threats to our oceans, and I commend George Monbiot for highlighting the issue (How to halt the greatest threat to the oceans? Stop eating fish, 9 May). But I disagree with his solutions. Up to 26m tonnes of fish caught annually are estimated to be illegal, unreported or unregulated. Bringing fisheries under sustainable management is essential to prevent the collapse of marine ecosystems. Governments have struggled to manage this global problem, but visit fisheryprogress.org and you will see how global fishing firms have worked with NGOs, regional authorities and vessel owners to establish regulations. Seafood companies have the resources to get everyone around the table to spur improvements. With their purchasing power, they can drive compliance with regulations. These rules not only support the recovery of overfished species, but also, as Monbiot notes, will ensure we have a healthy supply of seafood for generations to come.Darian McBainGlobal director of corporate affairs and sustainability, Thai Union • George Monbiot asserts that “even inshore fisheries are disastrously managed, through a combination of lax rules and a catastrophic failure to enforce them”. Inshore fisheries (0-6 nautical miles) are managed by 10 Inshore Fisheries & Conservation Authorities (Ifcas). Devon & Severn Ifca has an enforcement team and vessels fitted with forward-looking infrared cameras for distant observation. It has pioneered an inshore vessel monitoring system, mandatory for trawlers and scallop dredgers in our district. Between 2016 and 2018, Devon & Severn Ifca investigated 96 enforcement cases, and issued 28 warnings, three cautions and 25 penalties totalling £20,000. Fourteen cases were prosecuted, eight of which received fines of over £93,000. It has pioneered a system of permitting bylaws, allowing the management of trawling, netting, potting and diving for shellfish through 253 new measures.  The work done by Dorset & Severn Ifca shows that disastrous management and catastrophic failure of enforcement is not endemic. Prof Michael WilliamsDeputy chair, Devon & Severn Ifca • I was disappointed to see no coverage of the Mothers Rise Up climate march held in London on Sunday. It did not have any headline-grabbing civil disobedience or arrests, nor a well-known figurehead. But thousands of families came out in great numbers from across the UK, many with young children in tow, and marched, closing central London streets from Hyde Park to Parliament Square for a number of hours.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNews magazine Stern here reports on the shocking woes of German flagship public television networks ARD and ZDF (Germany’s versions of the Beeb).Hat-tip reader DirkH
Face it, they’ve been spoiled over the decades by cushy, protected conditions and have grown arrogant – so much so that they feel it is their duty to politically upbring viewers. Call it unfair and unbalanced television in almost every respect.
It was just the other day that I happened to watch the evening news on ARD the first time in about 3 years. And I decided it will probably be another 3 years before I watch it again. I haven’t seen the lovely Mariette Slomka on ZDF in over 5 years. I just can’t take these people anymore.
So with the haughty, orthodox-green public networks profusely bleeding red, the private ones like RTL are left to plunder the spoils of the ratings war. Unless you live in Hugo Chavez’s Venezuela, privately run and financed TV is the trend.
How bad is it for ARD and ZDF? According to Stern:
Even more dismal are the numbers for the segment of 14 to 49-year olds: Here ARD and ZDF rank only in 5th and 6th behind RTL, ProSieben, Sat.1 and Vox. Should this trend continue, public television will stop playing any role in the future.”

Why the fall? Like anything that gets royally subsidized up the wazoo, it’s just a matter of time before the organization gets old, crusty, and uncreative. Like a fat cat on a cold rainy day, the management settles comfortably down onto its warm cushion for a long peaceful slumber. While the rest of the free market innovates and creates, the public networks eventually wake up and wonder what happened.
So, what will the public networks do now that they are forced to face the horrors of the free market? The first solution of course will be to first deny reality, and to make demands for more money in the form of higher mandatory, much-hated GEZ fees that citizens are all forced to cough up. “We just need a little more money to improve the quality,” they’ll insist.
Their hemorrhaging is both wonderful and bad. Bad because we’ll likely have to pay higher fees.
And they’ll probably start a massive media campaign to remind public how great they are, and that viewers really ought to come back. For example, this is already happening on NDR public radio.
What are the chances of a private network like Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News getting a foothold in Germany? Are you crazy! Oh horrors! A Fox News Deutschland would be 10 times worse than any Fukushima. The last thing the old media guard is interested in is “fair and balanced”, let alone an alley cat like Fox News.
Readers, how is public TV faring in your country?

Share this...FacebookTwitterNatural Cycles
by Ed Caryl
Solar and ocean cycles indicate that cooling times lay ahead over the coming decades.
One argument against the CAGW hypothesis is the influence of natural cycles controlling weather and climate. In nature, there are many phenomena that are cyclic.

Figure 1. This is solar cycle variation 1975 to 2005, the recent solar maximum. Source: Wikimedia Commons.
The sunspot cycles are particularly obvious. Do these cycles influence the earth’s climate? Here is a table of documented cycles. They range from the shortest cycle found in sunspot numbers, 3.7 years, to the ice-age repeat-time of 100,000 years.

Table 1. This is a list of known cycles and data sources. The links are to the source documents. The background colors suggest related cycles.
The problem with pinning down the exact lengths and relationships of these cycles are two-fold. First, the signal is noisy…very noisy. Some of the noise is due to measurement inaccuracy, and some due to the fact that the real signal is noisy and chaotic. Second, there is modulation present on the signals; they vary a great deal in frequency and amplitude. Some of the modulation is regular, producing predictable effects on the main frequency (the “side-bands” noted in Table 1), and some is noisy and unpredictable.
The sunspot Schwabe cycle varies from 8 to 14 years. The thousand-year long cycles also vary by hundreds of years. But there are still patterns one can see in the lengths. The 3.7-year cycle is one-third of the 11.1-year Schwabe cycle. The 22-year Hale cycle is two Schwabe cycles. The wet/dry cycles observed in the western U. S. and other places are one Schwabe cycle or two Hale cycles. The AMO is three Hale cycles. The Gleissberg cycle is four Hale cycles. These are all related to the sun’s magnetic cycles.
The longer period cycles are also sun cycles; the periodicity is reflected in carbon-14 and other isotopes detected in ice cores, tree rings, and other sources. The primary periods seem to be 210, 420, 710, 1500, and 2200 years, with variation around each of those lengths caused by frequency and amplitude modulation, the shape of the waveform, and “beats” with the Hale cycle. (When you mix two frequencies you get third and fourth frequencies that are frequency 1 minus frequency two and frequency 1 plus frequency two). The Suess/deVries cycle is the spacing between the various named solar minimums: Dalton, Maunder, Sporer, etc. The longer 420-year cycle is twice the 210-year cycle. The 710-year cycle is a half-D-O/Bond event cycle and one-third the Hallstatt cycle.

Do we see these cycles in climate? Yes, of course. As mentioned above, wet/dry cycles, the AMO, and the cooling during solar minimums, are well known. The 200-year cycle discussed in the Lui et al paper, and here, is seen from Tibet to Antarctica. The D-O and Bond event cycles are climate-warming cycles that occur during ice ages and in interglacial times like the present. S. Fred Singer thinks that the recent warming was a Bond event. So does the Chiefio. So does this author. But the warming is over. Vahrenholt is correct, though he may have not gone far enough in his predictions.
Can predictions be made? Where are we in these on-going cycles? Nicola Scafetta uses the cycles from the 20 – 22-year Hale cycle and the 60 to 66-year AMO cycle to predict
much less warming in this century that the IPCC predicts. Dr. Scafetta makes passing mention of the longer cycles but does not factor them into his prediction. We are 210 years from the Dalton minimum of the early 19th century, and 400 years from the Maunder minimum. We are due.
Predictions for solar cycle 25 have it at Maunder minimum levels with a sunspot count under 10. This is a Grand Minimum. The solar cycle length is also getting longer. There seems to be a relationship between solar cycle length, sunspot number, and global temperature. If this relationship holds, we will see cooling of 0.5°C or more in the coming
decades.
This cooling has already begun in the Atlantic Arctic and interior continental areas. See Temperature History – Part 2 and BEST Fails to Account…, Figure 10.
Habibullo I. Abdussamatov of the Pulkovo Observatory in Russia predicts a reduction in Total Solar Irradience (TSI) of 0.5% by the mid-21 st century and another Little Ice Age lasting until 2100. S. Duhau and C. de Jager of the University of Buenos Aires and the Netherlands Institute for Sea Research, respectively, also forecast a Grand
Minimum in exactly the same time frame and “of the long type”.
Matthew Penn and William Livingston say that sunspots will disappear completely by 2016 to 2022, due to the magnetic fields reducing to a point to low to reveal them.
Counting Vahrenholt and Lüning, the above are seven predictions by seven different methods. All predict cooling in the coming years.
Some of the temperature trend predictions are for cooling to begin in 2014. After examining many temperature records all over the world, I believe that the cooling has already begun.

Figure 2. This is the annual global temperature trend for 2010 to 2011, Note in the upper right corner a figure indicating a global cooling of 0.12°C. Source GISS.
Figure 2 shows a global cooling year over year for last year of 0.12°C. Much of that is Canadian Arctic, Southern Russia, Africa, South Asia, Oceana, and the Eastern Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. The Arctic Ocean has yet to accumulate ice to cool Northern Siberia late in the melt season, so that region still shows warm. This will soon change. Next year the cold will come to Europe and Russia earlier because there will be more and earlier ice in the Arctic Ocean. This will become more pronounced in future years. Don’t sell your thermal underwear!

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s September and with it come signs of fall and expectations of winter.
Not again! Early forecasts point to another cold winter for Europe. (Photo credit: NOAA)
I’ve found some early winter prognoses of what Central Europe and Germany. I used to rely on Joe Bastardi for the euro winter forecasts, and he had a habit of being  correct. But he’s busy with his new Weatherbell now, and I’m not aware of him making euro-forecasts.
So I’ve had to look at other sources, and so far preliminary forecasts are signaling a snowy and cold Central European winter.
killikus.de here makes a comprehensive analysis for central Europe (in German) and presents its prognosis in its introductory box:
Prognosis for the winter weather and Christmas weather for Winter 2011/2012
Snow and water without end! Winter 2011/12 will be wetter than summer 2011.”
Killikus.de writes that the North Atlantic stream assured us warm and mild winters over the last decades, but since 2008 that situation has changed.
So since the year 2008 it is increasingly colder in the winter months and also wetter. As it appears now, the cold wet climate will pick up in the coming winter months.”
That means we ought to think about having snow shovels and road salt ready. And don’t put off the winter tyres. Killikus.de also cites an old North German farmer’s rule:

‘There are always 7 fat years that get followed by 7 lean years.’ The 7 fat years ended on 31 December 2008, and so ‘the 7 lean years will end on 31 December 2015’.  Until then, expect lots of rain and very cold winters.”
Killikus.de then explains how this is due to natural variations in northern hemisphere.
wetterprognose-wettervorhersage.de writes that the period September-November will be too cold and at times “considerably too cold”, and adds that eastern Europe and Scandinavia will lack precipitation. For the winter months of December – February:
…Eastern and Northern Europe will be significantly too cold. In Germany the 2011/2012 winter prognosis today looks as follows: mainly normal, but with cold spilling in at times from the east or north – considerably too much precipitation in January and February, whereby January 2012 will be rated too cold (January is the coldest winter month). The probability for a normal to cold 2011/2012 winter is higher than a winter that will be too warm.”
www.duessel-wetter.de does not make a winter forecast, but offers a fall forecast. First it writes that things dont’t look good for late September: Hope for a nice late summer in the middle of September has significantly diminished.
Only southeastern Germany will temperatures get above average! Otherwise things don’t look at all good. It looks like so-so autumn weather.
For Germany that means cool and wet. Duessel-wetter.de’s autumn forecast calls for a 32% chance the fall will be cooler, 30% chance it will be around normal, and a 38% chance it will be too warm. It should be pointed out that 38% chance is very low in these global warming times. Often  in the past chances of a warmer-than-usual winter were pegged at 70% or 80%…because it was thought CO2 was such a dominant driver.
Finally the National Weather Service  chart also indicates to cold for Europe in the months ahead:

"Bill Nye is done messing around. Look out, because while you might not typically associate angry talk with the normally-mild-mannered “Science Guy” Nye, when it comes to the threat of global climate change, he has – understandably, perhaps – lost his patience. And how. The beloved science educator and television personality, best known for his children’s program Bill Nye the Science Guy, appeared on Last Week Tonight with John Oliver on Sunday in a segment on the plan to fight climate change, and started throwing the F-word about – a lot. (The plan is sponsored by the US House of Representatives’ Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the longtime environmental advocate and Senator Ed Markey, and is known as the Green New Deal.) bill nye just grounded me and sent me to my room and i can’t come out until i make the planet stop melting pic.twitter.com/Uck1Qt2mau The non-binding resolution, as Oliver pointed out in the segment, has been especially polarizing, and is regularly ridiculed in bad faith by Republicans, despite the scale of the climate-based issues it merely suggests might be a good idea to address, such as carbon-pricing. In a short bit, Nye appears to explain why that concept might help. “When something costs more, people buy less of it,” Nye says in a makeshift science lab, cutting to the chase. He goes on to explain why burning less fuel in our cars or burning less coal might help prevent fires, floods, and crop failures. And then he says, because Oliver is a “42-year-old man who needs his attention sustained with tricks, here’s some fucking Mentos in a bottle of Diet Coke”, an experiment with mints and soda that appears to delight the host. After explaining the idea being carbon taxes, and the difficulty politicians have getting people to accept the idea of a new tax, Nye returns for another experiment to cut through all the talk. “By the end of this century, if emissions keep rising, the average temperature on Earth could go up another four to eight degrees,” Nye says, losing his patience. “What I’m saying is the planet is on fucking fire,” he says while taking a torch to a globe. “There are a lot of things we could do to put it out. Are any of them free? No, of course not. Nothing’s free, you idiots. Grow the fuck up. You’re not children any more. I didn’t mind explaining photosynthesis to you when you were 12. But you’re adults now, and this is an actual crisis, got it? Safety glasses off, motherfuckers.”"
"Governments around the world must introduce carbon taxes, halt plans for new coal plants and accelerate the closure of existing ones if damage to the Pacific from climate change is to be limited, the UN secretary general has told Pacific leaders on his first visit to the region. Antonio Guterres met leaders of Pacific countries in Fiji, on a trip that will also see him visit Vanuatu, considered one of the countries most vulnerable to natural disasters due to climate change, and Tuvalu, which is at risk of sinking under rising waters.  Speaking after meetings in Suva on Wednesday, Guterres acknowledged the region was “on the frontline of climate change” and its people were “important allies in the fight against it”. “Here in the Pacific, sea-level rise in some countries is four times greater than the global average and is an existential threat to some island states,” he said. “My messages to governments around the world from the Pacific are clear: first, shift taxes from salaries to carbon. Tax pollution, not people. Second, stop subsidising fossil fuels. Taxpayer money should not be used to boost hurricanes, spread drought and heatwaves, melt glaciers, and bleach corals. Third, stop building new coal plants by 2020.” His comments came in the closing days of the Australian election campaign, where climate action is a key issue.  Leaders of the Pacific Islands Forum told Guterres they were “running out of time” and asked him to share a message of urgency with the world, saying they were facing “an unprecedented global catastrophe”. “The blue Pacific – our great ocean continent, our thousands of islands, our strong and resilient people – is running out of time,” said forum leaders in a statement. “All countries, with no caveats, must agree to take decisive and transformative action to reduce global emissions ... If we do not, we will lose. We will lose our homes, our ways of life, our wellbeing and our livelihoods. We know this because we are experiencing loss already.” Guterres said climate change particularly affected women, offering the example of the effect of salinisation of food crops on pregnant women and newborn health, and said women needed to be involved in all decisions related to climate change. “There can be no successful response to a changing climate without also changing mindsets about the role of women in prevention and response,” he said. Dr Tess Newton Cain, a Pacific analyst and visiting fellow at the Australian National University, said this message was particularly important given there was only one national Pacific leader who was a woman – Hilda Heine, president of the Marshall Islands. She also said Guterres’ visit was very timely in light of the climate summit in September and that Pacific voices should be key in shaping the agenda. “What I was particularly struck by was that he was at pains to flag very clearly that not only are Pacific countries on the frontlines when it comes to being victims of climate change impacts but more importantly they’re on the frontline when it comes to resilience and innovation and global leadership,” she said. “These are small countries that have really not allowed themselves to be seen as hapless victims but they have grasped opportunities to take things forward and lead by example, it’s very pleasing that the UN secretary general has acknowledged that.”"
"Perhaps there’s a reason why still too few of us pay heed to warnings about how we are killing the planet by cruel and unusual methods. How can you persuade people to stop endangering other species and start protecting the environment when they don’t seem concerned about torturing themselves? According to Child Poverty Action Group in Scotland, almost one in four (230,000) of Scotland’s children are officially recognised as living in poverty, one of the highest rates in Europe. And unless there is a significant policy shift north and south of the border, the Institute for Fiscal Studies is forecasting that more than a third of UK children will be in poverty by 2022. The charity’s definition of child poverty is a reasonable one: “It means growing up in families without the resources to obtain the type of diet, participate in the activities and have the living conditions and amenities which are the norm in 21st-century Scotland.”  We are rarely more than a few weeks between revelations about another public health crisis in Scotland’s communities. The causes are wearyingly familiar to all those who have been paying attention. The communities that bear the brunt of these crises are the same as those that did so a hundred years ago. So if no government north and south of the border over the course of the century has been able to effect enough change in the living (and dying) circumstances of these neighbourhoods, how on earth can we be confident they will take steps to stop us torturing the planet? According to a UN report last week, about one million species of animals, plants and insects are facing extinction in the near future. No species, it seems, is considered too big or too plentiful to die. The pattern of irresponsibility mirrors that which characterises our efforts to end human poverty. We know what is required and we have the means to effect it. We even know the specific neighbourhoods and streets requiring most help to address poverty, while David Attenborough has told us exactly where to find the threatened species. We also know that if we don’t improve our means of producing food and energy and take greater care in disposing of waste there is a real risk of irrevocably destroying the ecosystem that sustains the existence of animals and humans. I think we’re also entitled to ask if there is a point at which we declare a state of emergency to rescue ourselves and our environment. Scotland could take the lead. This country imagines itself as providing a gold standard in caring for the environment. At the STUC conference in Dundee in April Nicola Sturgeon pledged to make Scotland carbon-neutral and thus make it “a healthier, wealthier and fairer nation”. The traditional embedded interests that have always influenced UK domestic policy would suggest that nothing will ever be allowed to interfere with free market priorities. The first minister should declare a state of national environmental emergency. It should take the form of a sort of national boot camp. Under this, the government would award itself special powers to impose a form of compulsory national service to save the planet and ourselves. It would apply to all over the age of 16. The following is a list of measures to get the ball rolling: no overseas travel (unless by boat) for two years. This would reduce our carbon footprint to around a manageable size four. It would also give an almighty boost to Scotland’s tourist trade and the fragile economy of the Highlands and Islands. Lots of jobs would be created and hard-pressed families would save money by not going on ridiculous trips to Florida and Cancun they can’t really afford. Compulsory beekeeping. Every Scottish family would be required to sign up to a national beekeeping register. This would enjoin them to volunteer for a minimum time each week looking after the wee furry fellas at the community beehive centre. We’d not only save the bees, which are a key building block of our ecosystem, it would get the kids out, give them a sense of purpose and improve their mental health. Mandatory adoption of an endangered animal. Every Scottish family would be required to adopt an endangered animal and help pay for its welfare. I adopted a couple of amur leopards a few years ago called Henrik and Lubo for a very small annual consideration. Regrettably, I let it lapse but am now scanning the internet for other threatened beasties to help out. Leave the Munros alone (for a wee while at least). I think some of our wild and beautiful places deserve a break from the intense human behaviour they’ve been subjected to over recent decades when Munro-bagging has become a chi-chi lifestyle accoutrement. I’d limit permits to much more sustainable levels. To ensure we are all getting exercise the Scottish government must establish compulsory attendance at community Falun Gong sessions. Compulsory lights out. Every family would be required to spend one day a week without any form of energy supply. This would be monitored by smart meters and Alexa (who we all know is spying on us anyway). Not only would it make us carbon-neutral more quickly but it would engender a sense of community and family togetherness in the candlelight. It would also boost the Scottish population, which an independent Scotland requires for a buoyant economy. Any unforeseen costs in rolling out the national boot camp would, in future, be met by the £163m annual savings on paying for Trident. • Kevin McKenna is an Observer columnist"

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe fundamental human right of scientific freedom gets trampled on in Germany. European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) Vice President Michael Limburg was denied making a climate science-critical speech at the University of Leipzig.  Are we slipping back into the science Dark Ages in Europe?Press Release from EIKE:
“University of Leipzig censors critical climate conference*. Fundamental freedom of science gets trampled.
Blatant censorship of dissenting scientific opinions on the subject of climate change and its causes is the post-modern trend. After recent attempts to ban the scientifically undesirable paper by renown scientists Spencer & Braswell (details here) and the ban of the climate-critical conference at the Belgian Society of European Engineers and Industrialists (SEII) by IPCC Vice Chair Prof. J. van Ypersele (details here), the Faculty for Physics and Geosciences of the University of Leipzig is the next to suppress open scientific debate. University of Leipzig Dean Prof. Dr. Jürgen Haase Tuesday barred a climate seminar organized by geography professor Werner Kirstein, as wells as the use of the University auditorium and participation by European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) Vice President Michael Limburg as the main speaker.Fortunately the ban was later relaxed and the seminar was allowed to go ahead.
The reason for originally having banned the seminar was a dissertation authored by Michael Limburg, which was critical of climate-science and was submitted to the faculty in March 2010. Two reviewers rejected the dissertation claiming, among other points, that it was inadequate. This is why Limburg was not welcome as a speaker, according to a letter from the Dean. The fact that the same dissertation had been recommended for acceptance by 4 other renowned professors went unmentioned by Haase. Limburg immediately challenged the ban.
What was so inconvenient about Limburg’s dissertation?
Under the supervision of Prof. Werner Kirstein, Limburg had written a dissertation that examined the quality of historical global temperature and sea level data in detail. His conclusions were damning. Using accepted rules for science and measurement, Limburg’s results showed that the datasets did not allow sea level and temperature change over the last 120-150 years to be determined anywhere near the alleged accuracies of millimetres or tenths of a degree Celsius respectively as claimed by the IPCC. The range of uncertainty, in both global mean temperature and sea level, is considerably greater than the total respective changes given by the IPCC. Every factor in attributing the possible causes of the changes was, at best, scientifically questionable.
Naturally, the faculty searched – and found – the “right” reviewers for assessing Limburg’s dissertation. In his decision to ban Limburg from speaking, Haase quoted only the objectively unfair and negative assessments. The fact that four other university professors had recommended the dissertation be accepted got no mention by Haase. Limburg officially contested the assessment delivered by the two reviewers, but they have taken their time to respond. Up to today there is still no response. Now a legal battle appears inevitable. Science has again been cast aside.
The high point of the whole affair is the open attempt by the University of Leipzig to silence Lim¬burg – even though he had been officially invited by a full professor. The Leipzig University faculty appears to be completely oblivious to this unworthy conduct.
Open debate is essential for the progress of science
This brings up Voltaire, the most famous philosopher of our time, and his words to his harshest opponent: ‘Sir, I do not agree with your opinion and I fully oppose you. But I would give up my life to assure that you will always be allowed to publicly express your opinion’. At the University of Leipzig, there has to be some colleagues among the philosophy faculty who are familiar with those words. But it looks as if the University leadership is not among them.”

"Your article describes Bill Nye, the children’s science presenter, getting justly angry about climate change (Bill Nye: ‘The planet’s on fire, you idiots’, G2, 15 May). But today’s children are not the first generation to have a sharp awakening to our violation of the environment – pollution was a major concern for youngsters of the 1970s. As a child, my cultural heroes were environmentalists. The Wombles recycled rubbish, singing: “Pick up the pieces and make them into something new / Is what we do.” Bagpuss was an expert in thrift: “We will fix it like new, new, new,” sang the mice. As a teenager, instead of buying new, I embraced the 1970s revival of handicrafts and made my own leather bags, floaty skirts and bead jewellery. Cars were a rarity and I travelled by bus, bike or on foot and got to know my neighbours.  Reducing our carbon footprint could take us back to the 1970s. But would that be completely bad? Today’s stressed youngsters might well enjoy the benefits of a less commercial society. After the anger, there may be space for a better way of life.Clare HobbaSt Albans • Commentary on the Met Gala (Fab-u-lous! The campest Met Gala ever, G2, 8 May), fashion’s most exclusive evening, touched upon all but one aspect of the event: environmental impact. The fashion industry is a major contributor to climate change; its carbon footprint exceeds that of international flights and maritime shipping combined. The UK government’s recent report on fast fashion makes a fitting and appalling comparison to the carbon footprint of all EU member states (3.5bn tonnes). The dyeing, finishing and washing of clothes also generates excessive water waste. The crisis in materials as well as changing consumer sentiment makes me question the role of renowned events such as the Met Gala in curbing climate change. The pinnacle of slow fashion – wherein ideas typically take nine months to materialise into a single product – may seem an odd method for changing the throwaway culture of fast fashion. However, the Met Gala’s role in fostering creativity to heights generally considered extravagant should be seen as the ideal platform for innovation. Competing ideas for how to green glamour at the level of high fashion, which can more readily assume risk, would pave the way for the gradual adoption of more sustainable methods by the wider fashion industry. The 2019 Met Gala carpet was pink. The case is overwhelming for next year’s carpet to be green.Alice MunnellyAthlone, Co Westmeath, Ireland • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

"Ireland’s parliament has become the second after Britain’s to declare a climate emergency, a decision hailed by the Swedish teenage environmental campaigner Greta Thunberg as “great news”. An amendment to a parliamentary report declaring a climate emergency and calling on the parliament “to examine how [the Irish government] can improve its response to the issue of biodiversity loss” was accepted without a vote late on Thursday.  The Irish Green party leader, Eamon Ryan, who moved the amendment, called the decision “historic”. Thunberg, the 16-year-old activist who has spearheaded protests across Europe and is becoming one of the most passionate voices of the green movement, urged more nations to follow suit. “Great news from Ireland!! Who is next?” she tweeted. Britain’s parliament became the first in the world to declare a climate emergency, passing the largely symbolic motion on 1 May. The step followed 11 days of street protests in London by the Extinction Rebellion environmental campaign group. Extinction Rebellion’s ultimate goal is to slash global greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2025 and to end biodiversity loss, steps that have won the backing of left-leaning politicians across the world. The British government is eyeing a 2050 target date to reach net zero emissions, which it says can be achieved without causing substantial economic damage and at a relatively low cost."
"If the government put a figure on the lifetime cost of dealing with childhood obesity, it may well find that money would be saved in the long run if schools were funded to provide healthy breakfasts and lunches for all children (Obesity-related hospital admissions rise by 15%, 9 May). This might also contribute to an improvement in educational outcomes since hungry children, as well as those who are full of E numbers, struggle to engage with learning. Furthermore, if these lunches were vegetarian it would contribute to a significant reduction in carbon emissions caused by rearing animals for meat.  We need some joined-up thinking in order to address the many and complex challenges we face – and making the link between obesity, educational outcomes and the environment would be a good start.Fiona CarnieAlternatives in Education, Bath • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

Share this...FacebookTwitterProfessor Werner Weber of the Technical University of Dortmund is the author of that infamous, consensus-shattering article “The CO2 Lies” appearing in Bild newspaper on Monday – also see here – which featured the new skeptic book that is causing an uproar in German climate science, written by Fritz Vahrenholt and Sebastian Lüning.
Now he is throwing in a few more shots of dissent, as he answers a message he received from another (seemingly indignant) North German professor (see below).
Naturally he has since received lots of mail, and not all of it friendly. For example here’s the message from the “indignant” professor, who wrote:
Dear Prof Weber,
I’m completely shocked by your article in Bild. What do you expect to accomplish with this?”
Here we see that in climate science, some professors have completely forgotten how science really works, and so need to be reminded. Here’s Professor Weber’s reply, which he published at “Die kalte Sonne site“. I’ve translated it in English with permission (slightly edited for clarity, emphasis added):
Dear Prof. [Completely Shocked],
I assume you belong to the climate scientists who subscribe to the assessments that the IPCC well represents. But to me you are not known as one of the protagonists of the IPCC’s opinion, like the directors and employees of the PIK [Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research], whom I’ve collided with before.
I came from the outside, after about 40 years of experience in the highly competitive field of condensed matter physics that involves the intense interaction between experiment and theory, a field with a culture of discourse that takes all controverisal and divergent opinions seriously.

The field of climate science appeared to me as being very dogmatic right from the start, at least concerning the fundamentals. In no time flat, the motto became: “the science is settled”. Those who now challenge the fundamental statements on climate are, in the best cases labelled as dimwits, and in the worst case they get labelled as “deniers”, analogous to a “Holocaust denier”. Let’s take Al Gore for example, admittedly a politician, or Pachauri, the IPCC spokesman, admittedly an engineer. But the statements made by leading representatives from the PIK were hardly different.
In the meantime I’ve worked myself halfway into the field of climate science. Even the most fundamental principles hold no water when truly subjected to closer scrutiny, and much, which doesn’t fit the overall narrative, is flat out ignored – and much involving key, central issues. In my guest piece in the book by Vahrenholt/Lüning “Die Kalte Sonne”, I clearly illustrated an example of this.
I’d be happy to present my arguments in a seminar presentation at your location if you wish.
Yours sincerely,
Prof. Werner Weber
Technical University of Dortmund

"The proliferation of single-use plastic around the world is accelerating climate change and should be urgently halted, a report warns. Plastic production is expanding worldwide, fuelled in part by the fracking boom in the US. The report says plastic contributes to greenhouse gas emissions at every stage of its lifecycle, from its production to its refining and the way it is managed as a waste product. This plastic binge threatens attempts to meet the Paris climate agreement. It means that by 2050 plastic will be responsible for up to 13% of the total “carbon budget” – equivalent to 615 coal-fired power plants – says the research published on Thursday. The contribution of plastic production and disposal to climate change has been largely hidden, say the authors of the report by the Center for International Environmental Law, which estimates the greenhouse gas footprint of plastic from the cradle to the grave for the first time. While plastic pollution in the oceans has become a high-profile concern, the effect on climate change of the ubiquitous use of plastic has not been a focus. “After the extraction of fossil fuels to produce plastic, the carbon footprint of a material which has become ubiquitous across the globe continues through the refining process, and on well past its useful life as a drinks bottle or plastic bag, through the way it is disposed of and the plastic afterlife,” the report says. The authors say disposable plastic found in packaging and fast-moving consumer goods forms the largest and fastest-growing segment of the plastic economy. They are calling for urgent action to stem production and flow of throwaway plastic. “At current levels, greenhouse gas emissions from the plastic lifecycle threaten the ability of the global community to keep global temperature rise below 1.5C,” the report says. “With the petrochemical and plastic industries planning a massive expansion in production, the problem is on track to get much worse.” The key actions which the authors say are required are: • Immediately end the production and use of single-use, disposable plastic. • Stop development of new oil, gas and petrochemical infrastructure. • Foster the transition to zero-waste communities. • Implement a system where polluters pay for the impact of their products – known as extended producer responsibility. “Plastic is one of the most ubiquitous materials in the economy and among the most pervasive and persistent pollutants on Earth,” say the authors. “It has become an inescapable part of the material world, flowing constantly through the human experience in everything from plastic bottles, bags, food packaging, and clothing to prosthetics, car parts, and construction materials.” Throwaway plastic packaging makes up 40% of the demand for plastic, fuelling a boom in production from 2m tonnes in the 1950s to 380m tonnes in 2015. By the end of 2015, 8.3bn metric tonnes of plastic had been produced – two-thirds of which has been released into the environment and remains there. “Packaging is one of the most problematic types of plastic waste, as it is typically designed for single use, ubiquitous in trash, and extremely difficult to recycle. A constant increase in the use of flexible and multilayered packaging has been adding challenges to collection, separation, and recycling,” the researchers said. Forty per cent of plastic packaging waste is disposed of at sanitary landfills, 14% goes to incineration facilities and 14% is collected for recycling. Incineration creates the most CO2 emissions among the plastic waste management methods. Nearly all plastic – 99% – is made from fossil fuels. Refining the material is the most greenhouse gas intensive part of the plastic lifecycle, and major expansions in the US and elsewhere will accelerate climate change, the report says. A Shell ethane cracker being constructed in Pennsylvania could emit up to 2.25m tonnes of CO2 each year and a new ethylene plant at ExxonMobil’s refinery in Baytown, Texas, could release up to 1.4m tonnes. The annual emissions from just these two new facilities would be equal to adding almost 800,000 cars to the road, the report says. In 2019 the lifecycle of global plastic production – from extraction to disposal – was equivalent to the impact on the climate of 189 500MW coal-fired power stations. By 2050, the report predicts, the global plastic footprint will be equivalent to 615 coal plants running at full capacity. “Plastic is among the most significant and rapidly growing sources of industrial greenhouse gas emissions,” the report says. “Emissions from plastic emerge not only from the production and manufacture of plastic itself, but from every stage in the plastic lifecycle – from the extraction and transport of the fossil fuels that are the primary feedstocks for plastic, to refining and manufacturing, to waste management, to the plastic that enters the environment.” Carroll Muffett, one of the authors, said: “It has long been clear that plastic threatens the global environment and puts human health at risk. This report demonstrates that plastic, like the rest of the fossil economy, is putting the climate at risk as well.”"

By Ed Caryl
Because pilots need to know the local weather conditions, most temperature-measuring sites are at airports worldwide. Airports, in turn, tend to be where the airport users are, near cities. As cities grow, so do the airports. As the airports and cities grow, the number of aircraft and aircraft operations grow. As operations (take-offs and landings) grow, more kerosene (Jet fuel, JP-1 and JP-4) is burned. It is widely recognized that large airports near large cities are in urban-heat-islands (UHI), but is it the local population or the amount of fuel burned that causes the UHI? And what is the error in temperature measurements?
Twenty airports in the central United States were found with long, continuous, temperature records. They ranged in size from the small airport at North Platte, Nebraska, to the Minneapolis-St. Paul International airport. The local populations ranged from 24,000 to 3.2 million. When counting aircraft operations, only multi-engine jet and turbine engine operations were used, commercial and military. General aviation aircraft operations were ignored. A Cessna 172, after all, burns about as much fuel on take-off as a Boeing 727 auxiliary power unit uses while sitting at the gate, that is, in comparison, not much.
The 20 airports were: Albuquerque NM, Bismarck ND, Cheyenne WY, Duluth MN, Eau Claire WI, Eppley Field (Omaha, NE), Lincoln NE, Memphis TN, Minneapolis MN, North Platt NE, 0klahoma City OK, Peoria IL, Pueblo CO, Salt Lake City UT, Sioux City IA, Springfield IL, St Louis MO, Topeka KS, Urbana IL, and Wichita KS.
The temperature trend used in Figure 1 is the linear trend over the 66-years from 1934 to 2000, inclusive, to include both the hottest year in the previous cycle to the hottest years in the current cycle. Temperatures are from the GIStemp web site here. The default (raw) annual data was used for each location.

Figure 1. This is a plot of the Temperature Trend for 20 U. S. airports versus local population and number of daily jet aircraft operations. The vertical scales are both logarithmic, thus the linear trends are seen as log curves.
The twenty airports in this plot sort themselves into three groups. The first group of eight seems the least contaminated by local heat sources, and plot along linear trends with R2 values of 0.862 for population and 0.7876 for operations. It makes sense that the population and aircraft operations should track closely, because the percentage of people that fly should be somewhat the same everywhere.
The second group of eight is smaller cities with fewer flights, and seems slightly more contaminated by local heat sources. Some sources were identified, and proved to be airport facilities like Instrument Landing System (ILS) equipment and runway approach lighting. The same rough ratio of people and flights holds, though the number of operations warms the environment slightly more than the people.

At the remaining four airports, the UHI from population completely breaks down, and only air operations have any significance. These four were examined closely. All had local heat sources within 50 meters of the temperature sensors. At three, what appear to be ILS buildings are close by, at the fourth; a generator building was the culprit (Figure 2).




Figure 2. This is the site at Cheyenne, Wyoming airport. The generator building is downhill about 40 meters from the temperature sensor A (heat rises). The image is from Google here.
It is clear from Figure 1 that in the absence of population and burned jet fuel, the temperature trend in the mid-U. S., from 1934 to 2000, has been cooling by about one degree C. It is also clear that the UHI affect in the vicinity of large cities and their airports, is about 1.5°C. Yes, fossil fuel use leads to warming, especially at airports. But if those are the only places being measured, it is like a blind-man describing an elephant touching only the trunk.

Figure 3. This is the cooling trend at 56 rural sites in the U. S. since 2000.
Since 2000, the U. S. has cooled one further degree, for a total since 1934, of 2.5°C. It is time for Messieurs Jones, Hansen, and Mann to switch back to global cooling.

Share this...FacebookTwitterClimate change because of man is causing more death and drought – especially in Africa, so claim the “experts”.
But what we have to remember is that many of these “experts are not reliable spend their time sitting in air conditioned offices in Zurich, London, or Manhattan and never really have gone out in the field and taken real scientific measurements. Many in fact just spew crap in the form of alarmist press releases to the gullible media. Hat-tip: International Business Times.

Der Spiegel above brings a report on the Sahel Region of Africa, interviewing Dutch geographer Chris Reij of the University of Amsterdam. Reij says the opposite is occurring: the Sahara is shrinking. It is not expanding.
Reij has been visiting and documenting “the greening of the Sahel Zone” for decades. According to Reij at the the 0:28 mark:

The Sahara is not expanding. Sure there are still some areas of drought. But it is a popular myth that is gladly spread by the media that the Sahara is creeping southwards more and more every year. Also serious organizations claim this agaian and again. But it’s not true.”
As Der Spiegel shows at 0:58, trees are growing where 20 years ago there was only sand. And people are learning to manage the land and to reforest the area. “Here there’s more success than what people believe,” says Reij.
Der Spiegel concludes:
The Sahel zone is called the ground zero of climate change by UN officials. But now it’s getting green because of people on site have learned to help themselves.”
Thanks, Der Spiegel, for this bit of reality from Africa.

"Vince Cable has warned that Liberal Democrats are “being underestimated again” in terms of their potential to make gains in the European elections. At a launch for the party’s election manifesto in Shoreditch, east London, its leader insisted they were “the biggest and best organised of the remain parties” in their preparations for the 23 May vote.  While climate change and cutting crime rates were high on the agenda, the event laid down the Lib Dems’ main aim to “stop Brexit” and hold a second referendum. Earlier on Thursday Cable unveiled the slogan for the party’s campaign to remain in the EU – “Bollocks to Brexit” – a phrase so frank, he claimed, that a supporter had fainted upon hearing it. In last week’s local elections the Lib Dems made big gains, leaving them in control of 18 councils and with 676 councillors. Appearing on his 76th birthday, Cable, said: “I’m optimistic, buoyed up by last week. Everybody underestimated us, and I think they’re underestimating us again.” He has confirmed that he plans to step aside after fighting the European election campaign in time for a new leader to be in place by the summer. While he championed EU freedom of movement as “a precious thing”, the MP for Twickenham also said being a part of the union meant the country was better at tackling threats like data cooperation and protecting itself from being bullied by the US president, Donald Trump. “We don’t deal with the Trump problem by grovelling and inviting him here for state business,” he added. Also speaking at the launch, the former secretary of state for climate change and Lib Dem MP for Kingston and Surbiton Sir Ed Davey said: “Sometimes people say they don’t know what we stand for – I think they get the message now.” Emphasising the importance of European arrest warrants, the EU’s law enforcement body Europol and other intelligence-sharing services in fighting “organised crime gangs, terrorists, murderers and rapists”, he said that “we also need to stop Brexit to stop the criminals.” “The world’s most dangerous criminals want Brexit to go ahead,” he added. “The criminals know that the security deal that has not yet even been agreed is weak, pathetic and will make every British citizen less safe than now. Brexit is a thousand crimes or more waiting to happen.”  Investment in the NHS, building affordable homes to help young people on to the housing ladder and more funding for schools were also listed as key issues for the party. Jo Swinson, Lib Dem MP for East Dunbartonshire, invoked the “tide of populism, with nationalism rolling in, Trump in the east and Putin in the west”. She added: “Surely this is not the time to turn our backs on our closest allies, our closest neighbours who share our liberal values.” "

If there’s a growing consensus about anything, it is that the man-made climate catastrophe is not going to happen, and that the scientists who believe to the contrary are becoming an ever increasingly obscure, fringe minority. Call them the natural-cause denialists.
Maybe many scientists are starting to feel that blaming everything on CO2 and neglecting the powerful sun, oceans and soot, among other factors, was a pretty stupid thing to do after all.
So it should not be a surprise that 2 more leading warmist German climate scientists Prof. Mojib Latif of the Leibniz Institute of Marine Sciences and Prof. Jochem Marotzke of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology have come out and conceded in newspaper interviews in the recent days that natural factors do have significant impacts on climate.
Latif says that half of the 0.8°C of global warming we’ve seen since 1850 is due to natural causes. Marotzke says that ocean cycles stopped the warming over the last 12 years.
At the “Die kälte Sonne” website, which was set up to counter false attacks on the book’s science, authors Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt direct our attention to the story and write as follows (reproduced with permission):
In an interview on February 9, 2012, with the Austrian daily Die Presse, renowned climate scientist Prof. Mojib Latif confirmed 2 fundamental assumptions made in the book “Die kalte Sonne”. Latif thus openly agrees with the view of authors Vahrenholt and Lüning that natural climate factors are responsible for about half of the 0.8°C of warming since the start of industrialization in 1850. A similar 50/50 ratio of anthropogenic vs natural climate drivers is also assumed by Professor Nicola Scafetta of Duke University in North Carolina (see page 135 in the book) as well as by physicist Prof. Nir Shaviv of Jerusalem (see page 86) in their models.

Here Latif is clearly positioning himself in contradiction to the claims made by the IPCC, which pegged the natural climate factors as having an influence of only single digit percentages. The all important magnitude of the so-called radiative forcings are for CO2 (1.66 W/m²) and the sun (0.12 W/m²), and are thus worlds apart.
Moreover, Latif confirmed in the interview that the stop in global warming over the last 12 years was caused by ocean cycles. Authors Vahrenholt and Lüning have the very same opinion in their book. Anything else would be surprising as the book itself is in part based on Latif’s work. Interestingly, even climate scientist Prof. Jochem Marotzke of the Max Plank Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg said in an interview yesterday with the TAZ daily that ocean cycles were the main reason for the stopped global warming since the year 2000. Thus the darling aerosol joker used by the IPCC is stripped of it’s importance.
Now that the first knee-jerk reactions to the book within the German climate science community are just about behind us, a real detailed look at the scientific content of the book “Die kalte Sonne” is beginning. Here it will hopefully become rapidly clear that the book offers a realistic interpretation that is supported by the results of numerous peer-reviewed scientific papers.”
Very profound admissions. So natural factors sun and oceans are real factors – aerosols are stripped of their importance. Conclusion: CO2 is disappearing as a major climate factor with every passing day – making the IPCC models obselete!
It needs to be pointed out that Jochem Marotzke less than 5 years ago warned: “There’s not much time remaining!” Now today he says the ocean cycles (unexpectedly) have given us 12 extra years, thus conceding they indeed do have major impacts on the climate after all. Yes, he seems to be learning something.
And simple logic tells us that if these ocean cycles have had an impact over the last 12 years, then it must also be conceded that the negative phases of the PDO and AMO will also continue to have an impact in the decades ahead. Anything else is just not serious.
Of course Latif and Marotzke may try to deny or underplay their latest admissions, which they probably do not even realise they have made. But their words are on the record for everybody to see. Read them yourselves!

"This has been called the climate change election, and with good reason: concern about the climate and environment has never been greater. A Lowy Institute poll found nearly two out of three adults believe climate change is the most serious threat to Australia’s national interests, an 18-point-increase in five years. It was taken before a landmark UN global assessment defined the extent of the unprecedented biodiversity crisis facing the planet, with a million species at risk of extinction and potentially dire consequences for human society.  Australia has a big stake in these issues. It is one of the world’s top greenhouse gas emitters on a per-capita basis and in the top 20 for total pollution, with a footprint greater than Britain or France. It is already experiencing the effects of climate change, including increased heatwaves and mass coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef, and is the global leader in mammal extinction. There are clear choices between the parties on these issues at this election. Guardian Australia looks at how the policies of the Coalition, Labor and the Greens line up. Carbon pollution in Australia has been rising since the Coalition repealed carbon price laws in 2014. The country is on track to meet its modest Kyoto protocol target – that emissions be 5% lower in 2020 than in 2000 – but not 2030 targets. Coalition Under the Paris climate deal, the Coalition says it will cut emissions to 26% less than they were in 2005 by 2030. It is significantly less than what scientists advising the government say is necessary for Australia to play its part in meeting the goals of the Paris deal (a 45%-63% cut by 2030 compared with 2005). Scott Morrison explained in February how he planned to meet this goal. About eight points of the cut would come from using what are known as Kyoto carry-over credits. Unlike international and domestic carbon credits created through offset projects, Kyoto carry-over credits do not represent an actual reduction in carbon dioxide. They are effectively bonus credits that Australia wants to award itself for beating its low 2020 target. It is unclear if they will be allowed under the Paris deal; other developed countries have said they will not use them. Developing countries do not have the option. The Coalition nominates two other significant sources of emissions reduction. One is the direct action emissions reduction fund, now rebadged as the climate solutions fund, under which farmers and businesses bid for cash from taxpayers to cut pollution. The government announced in February it would spend an extra $2bn on it over 10 years, but that was stretched to 15 years in the April budget, including just $189m over the next four. While some projects backed by the fund are widely considered worthwhile, an investigation by Guardian Australia has found questions over its design and uncertainty over what taxpayers were getting for their money. The biggest flaw is in the administration of the other half of the direct action program, known as the safeguard mechanism. It was supposed to put a limit on industrial emissions to ensure they did not just wipe out the cuts taxpayers are buying through the emissions reduction fund, but in practice industrial emitters have mostly been allowed to increase pollution without penalty. The Coalition has criticised Labor for planning to use the safeguard mechanism to do what government frontbencher Greg Hunt designed it to do: reduce emissions. The other major measure on the Coalition’s carbon budget chart (see p8) is “technological improvements”, which have not been explained. An analysis by scientists from Climate Analytics released on Friday found the Coalition’s target was insufficient to deal with the climate challenge and said there was no evidence the government planned to release further policies. Labor Labor has a more ambitious emissions target: a 45% cut by 2030, which Climate Analytics says falls just within what is necessary for Australia to play its part in limiting global warming to 1.5C, and net zero emissions by 2050. Rather than an across-the-board carbon price similar to what it introduced in 2011, it is promising different policies for different parts of the economy. On electricity, it wants to bring in a national energy guarantee, a policy devised and abandoned by the Coalition. Similarly, for heavy industry, it plans to toughen up the government’s safeguard mechanism to set limits and reduce them over time. It is yet to say what the limits would be and the trajectory – how fast they would be cut – but it says both the electricity and industrial sectors will have to meet the 45% target. It wants 50% of new cars to be electric by 2030 and has pledged vehicle emissions standards to limit transport pollution, building on work done under the Coalition but not adopted. It would boost the use of carbon offsets from Australia, allow business to buy an undefined amount from offsets from overseas and has suggested it would limit land clearing. Despite some scary headlines about costs, Labor’s ambition and direction has been praised by policy analysts and scientists. But unanswered questions remain. It has not released a carbon budget explaining how it would hit the 45% target. And it has been accused of hypocrisy for a promise to spend $1.5bn to boost natural gas supply in Queensland and to connect the Northern Territory’s Beetaloo sub-basin to the east coast. Green groups say the emissions that result could dwarf those from Adani’s proposed Carmichael coalmine. Speaking of which: Labor has struggled to articulate a position on the mine. Shorten has expressed personal reservations but not committed to either blocking or supporting it. Greens The Greens want emissions cut by between 63% and 82% by 2030 compared with 2005, and zero emissions by 2040. Their policies include ending fossil fuel subsidies, phasing out fossil fuel mining and electricity generation by 2030, vehicle emissions standards that become a ban on new petrol-fueled cars by 2030 and an economy-wide carbon price to reflect the true cost of pollution. A new public authority, Renew Australia, would lead the transition to low emissions. Climate Analytics says the Greens’ goals sit well within what the scientific literature says would be Australia’s fair share of emissions cuts. Coalition The government does not have a renewable energy policy for beyond 2020. It stresses there was significant investment – about $20bn – on large-scale clean energy last year. Most of this has come from the national renewable energy target, which it considered abolishing under Tony Abbott but ultimately reduced under a deal with Labor. The target won’t fund new generation after next year but existing support is maintained through to 2030. While the industry is surging, and the Australia Energy Market Operator has found there was likely to be about 46% clean energy by 2030 on the current trajectory, analysts expect new investment to fall if the target is not replaced. The Coalition’s big clean energy play is hydro. It is putting $1.4bn into Snowy Hydro 2.0, which is not expected to be operational until 2024, and supporting the “battery of the nation” project in Tasmania. Both promise “pumped hydro” – energy storage that can be called when needed. These projects have been found to make economic sense only if more coal plants close, but Morrison denies this is the plan. The government has indicated it would underwrite some new energy projects, having released a shortlist of 12. The list includes one coal upgrade project in New South Wales. Labor Bill Shorten has promised 50% of electricity from renewable sources by 2030. He says he will aim to win support in parliament for the national energy guarantee, which would force energy companies to reduce emissions and meet reliability obligations. If unsuccessful, he would tip $10bn into the government’s green bank, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, and create a $5bn fund to modernise the power grid. Other promises include $200m over the next four years for a household battery program, with a goal of 1m homes having batteries by 2025. Greens The Greens want the electricity grid to be 100% renewable energy by 2030. They would extend and boost the renewable energy target and back public investment, feed-in tariffs and regulations for clean generation, storage and energy conservation. Green groups, academics and lawyers have been campaigning for changes to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, the national environment law introduced by the Howard government 20 years ago. They say the law is designed to maintain the minimum viable population of a species or habitat while developments are approved, that the environment minister of the day has too much discretion over decisions and that Australia’s natural estate is declining rapidly on its watch. Coalition The government rejects claims the EPBC Act is not fit for purpose. It would review it, as required under the legislation, but not replace it. It promises a $100m environment restoration fund to clean up coasts and waterways, protect threatened species, boost recycling and reduce waste. Up to $10m of this would be dedicated to creating safe havens for threatened species. Scientific assessments of the policy range from not adequate to poor, especially in light of a 38% cut to the federal environment department budget. Fewer than 40% of threatened species had recovery plans last year to prevent their extinction, and the department has admitted it does not know if the recovery plans that are in place are being implemented. The Coalition does not have a policy to limit land clearing, one of the major threats to biodiversity. Morrison’s response to the shocking picture painted by the UN biodiversity report was to warn about the impact of “green tape” on business and to claim the government had passed legislation that does not actually exist. Labor Shorten says he would introduce new environment laws and a federal environment protection authority to oversee them, meeting a call from the Labor environment action network. There has been little detail on what the laws would do and what powers the authority would have. Its environment spokesman, Tony Burke, has said not to expect the changes in the first year of a Shorten government. The ALP promises a $100m native species protection fund, $200m over five years to double the number of Indigenous rangers managing the land and $200m for urban rivers and corridors. It would reverse the Coalition’s reduction in marine protected areas. Scientists said Labor’s plan appeared to be a positive initial step towards addressing the disaster highlighted by the UN but many questions remained unanswered. They stressed the need not just to protect threatened species, but to save and restore ecosystems to prevent further decline, and said more funding would be required. Greens The minor party also backs new environmental laws and a federal environmental protection authority but stresses it must be independent of politicians and have real teeth. It has proposed a $2bn nature fund to tackle invasive species, create new safe havens for threatened mammals, fund recovery plans for at-risk species, pay for 10,000 environment managers and boost the number of Indigenous rangers. It promises an expanded, science-based network of marine parks and an end to native forest logging. Scientists consider their policies the most thorough, though it has been noted that – as with the major parties – they are not making explicit the impact biodiversity loss would have on the economy. With China shutting down its market for Australia’s recycling and growing community desire to cut rubbish, all parties have made commitments to reduce plastic and deal with other waste. The commonwealth, the states and the territories have a goal of 100% of Australia’s packaging being reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025 at the latest. Coalition The government promises $100m for a recycling investment fund, $20m to accelerate recycling of batteries, electrical goods and plastic oil containers and wants to halve food waste by 2030. It would spend $20m researching new ways to deal with plastics, including using recycled material in manufacturing and construction. Green group WWF has criticised the government for not promising to ban single-use plastic. It says the European Union, which is targeting 10 types of single-use plastics, should be the benchmark. Labor The ALP says it will ban lightweight, single-use plastic bags and micro-beads by 2021 and create a national container deposit scheme that would pay people for recycling drink vessels. Other commitments include a $60m national recycling fund and targets for federal government purchasing of recycled products. Greens In addition to phasing out single-use plastics, the Greens would bring in a national container deposit scheme and similar programs for electronic waste, tyres and mattresses. They want an extra $500m over five years for infrastructure and a plastics research centre. Their headline goal is zero waste. The world’s biggest living structure suffered mass coral death due to increased ocean temperatures in 2016 and 2017, a disaster that has drawn attention across the globe. Coalition The government’s 2050 reef plan is designed to reduce local pressures and increase resilience to climate change, but not deal with climate change itself, the biggest threat facing the reef. Last year it gave $444m to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, a charity set up by business leaders that at the time of the announcement had only six full-time staff. The money is to be spent on improving water quality, crown-of-thorns starfish control and research. The Coalition has not explained why the foundation was chosen over government agencies. Labor The ALP says it would strip the foundation of most funding and reinvest it with public agencies dedicated to reef protection. It promises to work internationally to improve the response to climate change and to protect biodiversity and oceans. Greens The Greens say they would commit $2bn to improve water quality and stress the need for substantial action on climate change."
"Two long pipes imported from Iceland pump air out into the audience while glowing platforms designed to resemble multiple icebergs sit mounted on a stage behind two curtains made of chain. This isn’t your ordinary show, which stands to reason considering Björk isn’t your ordinary artist.  In fact, nothing the Icelandic singer-songwriter has done in her singular, 26-year solo career has been confined to normalcy or the concept of boxes or borders, with Björk gaining an acclaimed reputation as the ultimate experimenter in not only music, but fashion and visuals. Perhaps that’s why when The Shed, the new theater located in New York City’s recently opened Hudson Yards complex, was looking for a marquee name to help open their state-of-the-art space, they commissioned an artist who can explore the room for all it’s worth. Björk’s Cornucopia, a masterclass in exploration, is a show that’s being billed as her “most elaborate staged concert to date”, which plays with ideas of sound, lighting, costumes, video projection and set design. Created by Björk and directed by the acclaimed Argentinian film-maker Lucrecia Martel, making her theatrical debut, the production is concocted to be an immersive experience and is funneled straight from the singer’s unique psyche. It’s strung together using selections from her 2017 album Utopia, a bright record rooted in love and the bliss of romance. (She’s described it in the past as her “Tinder” album.) The overarching theme of Cornucopia, as well as the one that permeates most of Björk’s work is nature, with the majority of the imagery coming from flowers and fauna. (After all, to some she is chiefly remembered as the artist who wore a swan dress to the 2001 Academy Awards; the relic is currently displayed about 40 blocks uptown as part of the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Camp exhibition.) Supporting the visuals, natural sounds are employed, with one instrumentalist pouring water into a basin hooked to a microphone; the splashing liquid timed to the melody. Björk explores her shimmering utopia with the help of an eclectic cast. Chief among them are the Hamrahlid, a buoyant Icelandic children’s choir who, in addition to supporting the singer in a variety of songs, also serve as Cornucopia’s opening act, belting out both covers from Bjork’s vast discography and traditional Icelandic songs. There’s also Viibra, the moniker of an all-female flute septet that flanked the stage boasting flowing white costumes who, in succession, frequently jut their instruments in the air mid-song. The septet also supports Björk’s previously stated mission statement that Cornucopia is about females supporting each other. It’s an idea that’s brought to life when four members of the septet play a large, specially made circular flute that’s suspended from the air. (It requires the breath from all four to work.) Fresh off his high-profile appearance at Coachella, serpentwithfeet also joined Björk on stage for Blissing Me, a remix of her Utopia track. The two brought the collaboration to life in a surprising R&B mashup, with Björk’s tender vocals juxtaposed to the thumping of serpentwithfeet’s LGBTQ love ballad. (Example lyrics: He reminds me of the love in me.) With an artist so firmly rooted in the natural world, the performance also doubled as a dire warning on climate change. Halfway through the production, a message about the dangers of pulling out of the Paris climate accord is projected. As the show, which celebrates the beauty of the Earth nears its end, a powerful message courtesy the young Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg is presented. “You say you love your children above all else, and yet you are stealing their future in front of their very eyes,” she says via a video message, portions of which were greeted by cheers from the audience. “Until you start focusing on what needs to be done rather than what is politically possible, there is no hope. If the solutions in this system are so impossible to find, then maybe we should change the system itself.” Björk’s Cornucopia will be at The Shed in New York through 1 June 2019."

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhen it comes to reviews of Fritz Vahrenholt’s and Sebastian Lüning’s controversial best-selling Die kalte Sonne book, now sweeping across Germany, Dr. Peter Heller, think tank member and contributor at the German Science Skeptical blog, has published what up to now has been one of the most thoughtful and insightful essays – a welcome change from all the shallow and emotional reviews we’ve seen from the knee-jerk warmists.
One of Heller’s main points is that anyone claiming climate can be predicted and is now solely “created” by man is as scientific as the theory of finger-snap-and-behold creationism. The following is an excerpt translated from Heller’s essay (emphasis added).
Vahrenholt and Lüning do not assume the role of scientists, but that of science journalists. The demand to present the book’s assertions in an appropriate form using the appropriate tool (such as publication in a suitable journal) for scientific internal debate just proves once again the totalitarian demand of the climate creationists. Not only are they blind with respect to the already acquired findings that contradict their world view, but they are also no longer able to distinguish between a scientific activity, and the reporting of that activity.
Vahrenholt und Lüning led me to the term “climate creationist“. In the same way their book helps to put energy policy back on the track of rationality, it could also promote the return of reason in climate debate. In my view their main message is: We do not know what the future has in store for us. […] Somehow this simple knowledge has become lost in our society over the past decades.
Vahrenholt und Lüning deserve credit for thrusting the indefiniteness of our climatic future back into the public consciousness. They show us how natural factors could counter an anthropogenic warming.

Whoever refuses to permit such thoughts is acting unscientifically and against the pursuit of truth. And whoever opts to ignore these ideas, or even fights to create an environment that does not allow them to be even expressed, is also guilty of the same – just as someone who through religious fundamentalism is convinced of the creation of the world by a Creator, an Intelligent Designer. The theory of evolution describes the principles to which the development of life on Earth are subject. It neither provides a basis for the existence of mankind itself, nor for any other specific life form, nor does it provide any prognosis for the future. In fact it only tells us that random coincidences mutually interact. It’s completely open as what comes out as a product.
Where the conventional creationist sees a (supernatural) creator and designer behind the living environment, the climate creationist views man as the sole creator of the (future) climate. Die kalte Sonne holds up a mirror and shows us how they have meandered far away from science.
Particularly very important to observe is what Vahrenholt and Lüning only mention between the lines. Namely the question of to what extent does a possible warming of the lower layers of the atmosphere have whatsoever on man. Here the climate creationists see a huge danger and thus completely ignore possible adaptation strategies by human societies – completely in contradiction to the experiences of the last thousands of years.”
Neglecting strategies for adaptation is one way of creating your own eventual premature downfall. Unfortunately we are dealing with climate fundamentalists, zealots, and not scientists.
Anyone who knows the German language is urged to read Heller’s essay at Science Skeptical.

has a piece on the hype surrounding hurricane Irene, which we recall was supposed to end up being the most super-charged hurricane to hit the Northeast US in a quarter century.
Hurricane hype blows back against the warmists. (NASA photo)
It ended up being a hurricane of hype, and nothing else. But the FAZ writes if Irene had been a mega-size hurricane, it would have been just what the doctor ordered for unlocking the climate politics gridlock in the USA.
There, interest in climate change has slid so deep into the basement that even ex-presidential candidate and climate protection activist Al Gore has to be really worried about the impact of his new campaign which will begin on September 14.”
For Al Gore, Irene could have served as the ideal climate wake-up call. He certainly would have seized the opportunity to exploit it in citing it as the latest example of climate catastrophe. Can you imagine his disappointment? Unfortunately for Gore and the warmists, Irene fizzled and is now ironically being used by skeptics to illustrate rampant climate hysteria and media hype instead. The FAZ writes:
Indeed the climate-political winds turned in the opposite direction. Instead of acting as a ‘harbinger of climate change’, as the New York Times had written on Saturday, the tropical storm worked massively against hurricane and climate science.
Half-assed, superfluous, and damaging – these are some attacks that scientists now find themselves having to deal with because, though they were correct with their time forecasts, they were nowhere near correct with the hurricane’s strength forecast.”
Here the FAZ doesn’t know that the forecasters were also incorrect with the projected route of the hurricane, as forecasters made huge adjustments with each route  forecast cone they issued. And by the time the hurricane made landfall it had degraded down to a mere Cat 1 hurricane, and shortly thereafter to a tropical storm. By this time, the entire US national weather and climate forecasting network and large parts of the media had become a laughing stock.
The alarmists are trying to argue back, sometimes with what appear to be quite dubious claims. Stefan Rahmstorf, citing Nature, claims that for every 1°C of temperature rise, there is a 31% increase in Cat 4 or 5 storms. The FAZ also brings up Kerry Emanuel:

At the Hurricane Conference, leading American expert Kerry Emanuel showed for the Atlantic that the correlation of sea temperature and hurricane energy has strengthened over the last five years.”
Really? Looking at the last fives years, one would have to assume the globe is cooling rapidly.
GLOBAL HURRICANE FREQUENCY
 
Source:  http://policlimate.com/tropical/index.html
What does expert Ryan N. Maue say about climate and hurricanes?
But, the overall trend is flat proving conclusively that there is NO “overall” global increase in hurricanes, minor or major. Since natural variability such as El Nino and La Nina is the primary driver of global hurricane variability, any discussion of “climate change” impacts on TCs is woefully incomplete without acknowledging the effects of ENSO on global TC activity.”
Politically, Irene has turned out to be the ideal storm – for the skeptics! Indeed attention has been drawn to where the alarmists least want it: facts and reality.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNo doubt Europeans this year have been enjoying a relatively mild winter this year, unlike the previous 3 winters. But it may be too early to start planning for spring. Mother Nature has a way punishing the overly optimistic.
At www.wetter24.de the ProfiKarten (professional charts) provide computer generated forecasts in the form of nice color charts. The first chart shows the outlook for 7 days – more of the same mild weather:
The cold is restricted to Scandinavia and Northern Russia.
But at the 10-day mark things really start to change. Of course when the computers grind through the next batch of data, the picture may change. 10-day forecasts are still not that accurate. For now, here’s the latest 10-day picture for Europe (temperature):
Note how the cold plunges through Eastern Europe and makes its way deep into Germany. After 14 days, much of Europe is forecast to be gripped by bitter cold:
So you might want to hold off putting the winter gear away!

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s something the alarmist warmists can put in their pipes and smoke.
A new paper titled El Niño–Southern Oscillation variability from the Late Cretaceous Marca Shale of California authored by Andrew Davies, Alan E.S. Kemp, Graham P. Weedon, and John A. Barron shows that a permanent El Nino did not exist during that particular greenhouse episode.
The latest Cretaceous laminated Marca Shale of California permits a seasonal-scale reconstruction of water column flux events and hence interannual paleoclimate variability. The paper’s abstract continues (emphasis added):

Time series analysis of interannual variability in terrigenous sediment and diatom flux and in the degree of bioturbation indicates strong periodicities in the quasi-biennial (2.1–2.8 yr) and lowfrequency (4.1–6.3 yr) bands both characteristic of ENSO forcing, as well as decadal frequencies. This evidence for robust Late Cretaceous ENSO variability does not support the theory of a “permanent El Niño,” in the sense of a continual El Niño–like state, in periods of warmer climate.”

In the paper’s conclusion we find:

There is therefore little support for the existence of a ‘permanent El Niño’ in the Late Cretaceous, in the sense of the continual El Niño state depicted by Fedorov et al. (2006). […] there was robust ENSO variability in past “greenhouse” episodes and that future warming will be unlikely to promote a permanent El Niño state.”

This is not the first paper to suggest that. You can read about an earlier paper here.
So much for the scare that the CO2 emitted by man would propel the planet into a permanent El Nino burn-up, as Ray Pierrehumbert and climate models suggested here at RealCrock:
How will the El Niño phenomenon be affected by a global warming?
…how ENSO will respond to a global warming is still not settled. However, it seems that one common trait among some climate models is the indication that a global warming may result in a more a general El Niño-type average state (eg. Collins et al. 2005, Climate Dynamics, 24, 89-104. 19 and here).”
So much for “settled science”.
