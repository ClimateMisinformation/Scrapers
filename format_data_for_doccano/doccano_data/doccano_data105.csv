"Donald Trump’s latest Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh accepts that humans are causing global warming and we need to take action to stop it. The problem is that he doesn’t trust the experts at EPA to do so and wants to erode their authority to regulate carbon pollution.  When discussing Chevron and climate change, we usually focus on the company’s legal liability. However, in Kavanaugh’s context, ‘Chevron deference’ is even more important. The term refers to the fact that courts will generally defer to government agency interpretations of laws as long as Congress hasn’t spoken directly to the issue at hand. David Doniger, director of the climate and clean air program at the Natural Resources Defense Council noted that Kavanaugh doesn’t believe Chevron deference applies on issues of major importance. In a recent net neutrality case, Kavanaugh argued, “While the Chevron doctrine allows an agency to rely on statutory ambiguity to issue ordinary rules, the major rules doctrine prevents an agency from relying on statutory ambiguity to issue major rules.” That’s Kavanaugh’s position on climate change. In oral arguments before his DC Circuit Court of Appeals in a 2016 Clean Power Plan case, Kavanaugh said: This is huge case … it has huge economic and political significance … it’s fundamentally transforming an industry by telling existing units you in essence have to pay a penalty, a huge financial penalty in order to continue to exist, in order to shift from coal plants to solar and wind plants, at the same time the coal mining industry is in essence greatly harmed, as well. But while regulating carbon pollution would have a major impact on the fossil fuel industry, the same is true of most pollutant regulations. It’s nevertheless EPA’s job to regulate pollutants, and the agency has been doing exactly that since its inception. In the 2016 oral arguments, Kavanaugh said that the Clean Air Act is “a thin statute, it wasn’t designed with [greenhouse gases and climate change] specifically in mind.” But EPA was created to address various types of pollution, and the Clean Air Act gave it that legal authority. As the Act’s text notes: the growth in the amount and complexity of air pollution brought about by urbanization, industrial development, and the increasing use of motor vehicles, has resulted in mounting dangers to the public health and welfare The Clean Air act also defined the term “air pollutant” very broadly to allow EPA the flexibility to regulate any new sources of pollution that the agency might identify in the future: The term “air pollutant” means any air pollution agent or combination of such agents, including any physical, chemical, biological, radioactive (including source material, special nuclear material, and byproduct material) substance or matter which is emitted into or otherwise enters the ambient air. And it gave the EPA Administrator the authority to regulate any pollutants that threaten public health and welfare: For the purpose of establishing national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards, the Administrator shall within 30 days after December 31, 1970, publish, and shall from time to time thereafter revise, a list which includes each air pollutant … emissions of which, in his judgment, cause or contribute to air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare The Clean Air Act even envisioned EPA’s regulatory authority extending to impacts on the climate: All language referring to effects on welfare includes, but is not limited to, effects on soils, water, crops, vegetation, manmade materials, animals, wildlife, weather, visibility, and climate… In the landmark 2007 case Massachusetts v. EPA, the Supreme Court affirmed that greenhouse gases qualify as air pollutants, and EPA therefore has authority to regulate them if the agency determines that they may endanger public health or welfare. In its 2009 Endangerment Finding, that was indeed EPA’s conclusion: greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may reasonably be anticipated both to endanger public health and to endanger public welfare .... The major assessments by the U.S. Global Climate Research Program (USGCRP), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and the National Research Council (NRC) serve as the primary scientific basis supporting the Administrator’s endangerment finding. In a key 2014 case Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, the Supreme Court ruled 7 to 2 that EPA can continue to treat greenhouse gases as pollutants subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act and can apply those regulations to power plants. Justices Scalia, Roberts, and Kennedy joined the majority decision. The good news is that Scalia’s position in this case was modeled after a prior Kavanaugh opinion. But generally speaking, Kavanaugh doesn’t trust the EPA experts to regulate carbon pollution. In the 2016 oral arguments before his court, Kavanaugh laid out his case for why Congress, not the EPA should tackle climate change: Earth is warming, and humans are contributing, and I understand the international collective action problem here, I understand that very well, and I understand the frustration with Congress, I live that, too, everyone understands that. But under our system of separation of powers, and this is why it’s so important that we maintain that, Congress is supposed to make the decision. You might say, you know, this Congress is not going to, they’re not going to do anything, but that’s not how we get to make decisions … for a big question like this Congress can do things like job training programs, and community college assistance, and welfare assistance, and drug programs for the people who are out of work, and that becomes more of a problem, that’s why the separation of powers principle matters, because Congress can look at something like this in a well-rounded approach, and that was the difficulty obviously that happened in the Senate. But for us to do it, for you to do it, all the people who are left behind are just left behind. Kavanaugh is right that Congress could and should do a better job tackling carbon pollution than EPA. For example, Hillary Clinton developed plans to both tackle climate change and help coal communities adapt. But Republicans in the White House and Congress are owned by the fossil fuel industry, and thus unwilling to advance serious climate legislation. However, the fact that Congress won’t act as long as Republicans are in charge doesn’t lessen EPA’s authority to regulate carbon pollution. Kavanaugh’s unwillingness to defer to EPA’s legal authority is wrong. The Clean Air Act is very clear that EPA should regulate pollutants that may endanger public health and welfare, and greenhouse gases certainly qualify. If Kavanaugh is seated on the Supreme Court, he’ll join the other conservative justices in eroding EPA’s ability to regulate carbon pollution. EPA won’t take serious action until there’s a Democrat in the White House anyway; nor will Congress act unless Democrats are in charge of that branch of government. Kavanaugh just represents one more Republican obstruction to climate action."
"As a third-generation farmer from Harden in New South Wales, I’ve weathered climate extremes my whole life. It’s simply part of doing business in one of the most variable climates in the world. The truth is, Australian farmers are good at what they do, and we know when things are changing.  NSW last year was 2 degrees above the baseline average, without an El Niño in sight. This year we’ve already seen 100% of the state drought-declared. The minimal amount of winter crop that has sprouted is sizzling on the stalks or bitten hard by severe -5C frosts. To the north the dams are parched and farmers across the state are close to walking off the land. It’s not just the farmers, either. In the past five years, my local town, amalgamated against the wishes of the local population, has struggled to keep council staff. We have seen a local bank and a favourite watering hole close. We are about to lose our Landcare facilitator who has been a critical element in natural resource management, sustainable farming and drought support. We can and must do better. This is not a “hard-done-by farmer” narrative. We’re tough and we manage our resources carefully, making decisions based upon the best available evidence and always keeping one eye to the future. This is an area with a long history of working with scientists and advisers to be prepared for future agricultural, environmental and economic shocks. But, the first step to managing for the future is to grapple with reality. And the reality is that our climate is on a devastating trajectory. Much as our politicians like to deny reality, out here – beyond the air-conditioned hallways of parliament – we’re already dealing with increasingly extreme weather as a result of global warming. So, a message to our elected representatives. Get your heads out of the coalpit and back into the real world. We need meaningful action now; including support for regional communities and funding for Landcare facilitators to be driving up driveways and checking on those whose lives are being destroyed by your failure to take action. We need a good heavy dose of reality injected into Australian politics. On Monday, my fellow farmers and I will stand outside parliament and rally for our future. A future in which our kids have a chance to farm and our government no longer hides from the truth. The alternative is simply unthinkable. • Peter Holding is a mixed cropping and sheep producer with 40 years’ experience on his family farm"
"An international meeting in Bangkok fell short of its aim of completing fruitful preparations to help an agreement be reached in December on guidelines for implementing the 2015 Paris climate change agreement. The six-day meeting, which ended on Sunday, was scheduled to step up progress in the battle against rising global carbon emissions by adopting a completed text that could be presented at the COP24 conference in Katowice, Poland, three months from now.  A primary objective of the 2015 Paris agreement, to which 190 nations subscribe, is to limit the global temperature increase by 2100 to less than 2C and as close as possible to 1.5C, which is vital to the survival of island nations threatened by rising seas. But the absence of guidelines for meeting that goal has led to fears that not enough action is being taken. There have been notable disagreements over fair financing for implementation of the rules by developing countries, and the technical details of their reporting on progress. Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, said on Sunday at the closing press briefing for the Bangkok meeting that progress was made on most issues but nothing was finalised. The meeting was attended by representatives of most of the countries party to the Paris agreement, as well as the United States, which has announced that it is pulling out of the pact. Espinosa said there was “limited progress” on the issue of contributions from developed nations to developing countries, adding that she is “hopeful” that future discussions will be productive because of the importance of the issue. “On the core issues of forward-looking climate finance and the degree of flexibility developing countries should be given on the information and reporting requirements for national commitments under the Paris Agreement, negotiators were stalemated in Bangkok,” said a statement from Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy for the Union of Concerned Scientists, a US-based activist group. “It’s now up to the incoming Polish presidency and officials leading negotiations to find ways to bridge the deep differences on these issues and to secure agreement in Katowice on a robust, comprehensive package of rules to implement the Paris Agreement,” he said. Harjeet Singh, climate policy manager for ActionAid International, said that a vital component of the Paris agreement is for wealthy nations to provide financial assistance to developing countries as they fight natural disasters brought by climate change. But he said wealthy and developed countries “led by the United States and including countries such as Australia, Japan and even the European Union” refused to clearly show “how much money they are going to provide and how that is going to be counted.” Advocacy for the developing countries was led at the meeting by China, said Meyer, but was also supported by others, including India, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Malaysia. Activists were critical of Washington’s lobbying at the meeting, especially because president Donald Trump has announced plans to have the US withdraw from the Paris pact, which had been heavily promoted by his predecessor, Barack Obama. “The US has announced its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement but still negotiates as if it is a party, weakening international cooperation by not contributing to finance and technology transfer to developing countries,” Meena Raman, legal adviser at Third World Network, said in an emailed statement. Climate change is a polarising issue in the United States, and some states and local communities have announced policies supporting the Paris agreement. Thousands of governors, mayors, company CEOs and civil society leaders are expected to gather this week in San Francisco for the Global Climate Action Summit."
"Climate change activism has always had the stubbornly tough task of mobilizing the public to confront a slow-moving, largely invisible problem while being stymied by a fantastically wealthy fossil fuel industry and an array of sceptics in politics and the media. Climate campaigners would, therefore, be forgiven a few moments of despair in the era of Donald Trump. Trump's election elicited two large public howls from those concerned about climate change – the People's Climate March and the Science March, held within days of each other in April last year – but any hopes of persuasion have now given way to attritional confrontation and attempts to bypass the administration altogether. Now a series of marches and other events across 70 countries on Saturday called Rise for Climate Action, is framed as a grassroots movement aimed squarely at spurring local mayors, businesses and state leaders to slash emissions regardless of Trump, with the hope a future president will find the momentum impossible to ignore. “I'd hesitate to say we are giving up on the federal government at the moment but we have to be realistic,” said May Boeve, the executive director of 350.org, a climate change campaign group that is a lead organizer for Saturday. “Quite a lot can be done at the city level and we have an opportunity to highlight that. We are up against huge obstacles and Donald Trump is a massive one. This is about being clear what we are asking for when the opportunity presents itself.” The message being honed for the Rise for Climate Action is one of a swift transition to 100% renewable energy, with the image of fossil fuel companies painted as being little different from their tobacco counterparts. Many of those taking part in the various marches and other events in the US will be highlighting the aspects of society worsened by climate change, such as inequality and racial prejudice. Miya Yoshitani, of the Asian Pacific Environmental Network, will be taking part in the main climate march, which expects to attract tens of thousands of people in San Francisco, to decry the air pollution suffered largely by black and Asian American communities in the Bay Area. “There are refineries and freeways so air quality is a big issue for everyone, but race is a bigger factor than income as to how bad you get it,” she said. “The Bay Area is known to be a very progressive place, with its technology and innovation, but it's also a place of extreme inequality. There is massive gentrification and displacement of people and climate change is a huge threat multiplier for those things. “Here, climate change is things like sea level rise, wildfires and drought but it's also housing affordability and energy costs. The effects are going to be borne by low-income communities that already miss out on school and work days because of air pollution. It's not a distant threat, it's here right now. “I grew up in Chicago but moved here in the 1990s and have seen these huge changes with the growth of the dotcom companies. We feel [California governor] Jerry Brown has failed some of these communities and we have to let him know we will hold him accountable.” The San Francisco march, timed as an unofficial curtain raiser for the Global Climate Action Summit that starts in the city next week, will demand that Brown end fossil fuel extraction and begin the complete shift to renewable energy recently backed by California lawmakers. Activists fear that even states purportedly progressive on climate change, such as California, are leaving behind certain communities. “California is on fire at the moment and we have flooding and heatwaves caused by a fossil fuel industry that is being allowed to continue when everything needed for a just transition is available,” said Pennie Opal Plant, an environmental campaigner of Yaqui, Mexican, Choctaw, Cherokee and European descent. “Native people are going to be at the very front of the march because we are on the frontlines of fossil fuel extraction and processing. In the Bakken oil fields [an area in Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota] there are high rates of cancer, in the tar fields of Canada they've destroyed and poisoned huge areas of boreal forests where people hunt and find medicines. “My family has lived in the Bay Area since the 1930s and Chevron and the other refineries have just got bigger and bigger. It's been a constant struggle and the rates of cancer and asthma are very high. In our tribal traditions we understand we are responsible for the wellbeing for the coming seven generations. As a grandmother I'm concerned we are not handing a healthy environment on to my grandson and his generation.” Opal Plant said it was “devastating” to see the Trump administration throw open large tracts of land for oil drilling and coalmining, including areas in the Arctic and Utah considered crucially important both spiritually and for hunting. “It's an horrendous nightmare to think they'd drill in the Grand Canyon or Bears Ears [national monument in Utah],” she said. “We've got to rise up because that's how slavery was abolished, that's how women got the vote and how civil rights came about. There's nothing more important right now than to rise up to ensure a livable environment for the future.” Protesters in Puerto Rico will demand that the US territory rebuild its electricity grid, which was shattered by Hurricane Maria last year, with renewable sources such as solar and wind, while people will gather in Miami to call for greater urgency to confront the threat of sea level rise. Others will target specific projects, such as a planned electricity substation in Boston, located in a flood-prone area of a diverse neighbourhood, and a new oil pipeline near New Orleans that acts as an extension of the controversial Dakota Access endeavour. “This pipeline starts on indigenous land and it ends in St James, an African American area that is already surrounded by a dozen petrol-chemical facilities,” said Anne Rolfes, who grew up near the heart of the oil industry in Lafayette, Louisiana. “We will be demanding that people in St James get an evacuation route for when one of these plants explodes, because there isn't one at the moment. It's a pretty pathetic request really, to be frank. “Stopping the pipeline is an urgent issue too but we need a damn evacuation route. If you're rolling over the top of these communities you've at least got to let them have a way out. “Elected officials pretend to care about flooding but they've never met a petrol-chemical project they didn't like. These areas in Louisiana are going underwater but it's just one big anti-climate science parade. “It's not as if we have any level of government that is responsive at the moment but acting now is better than if we just did nothing. To some degree you need blind faith in some sort of miracle down here. I think we will have around 200 people for the protest, which is quite good for Louisiana.” Some of those taking part dismiss any focus on Trump as merely a distraction from decades of decisions in the US that have placed minority communities directly in harm's way from power plants, landfills and other sources of insidious pollution. “I'm tired of doing marches in Minnesota. People do them and go home and say 'I've done my bit now,' which isn't how it works. We need a strong, lasting movement,” said Sophia Benrud, a chef who is helping set up an event explaining the dangers of climate change in a district of east Minneapolis historically blighted by industrial pollution. “The Trump administration isn't what is motivating me. I hate politics. This is about my life, my family. We have had white people setting our agenda for a long time. Look at Flint and the problems there. Would you ever see that in a wealthy white neighbourhood? Obviously not. “I've always cared about the planet. I'm the woodland creature out of all of my friends; I would happily never live in the city again. Climate change is a symptom of people not being taken care of. If we don't take care of people and of inequality, we will never solve this problem.”"
"On the banks of the El Max canal near the Egyptian port city of Alexandria, one man untangles fishing nets in his turquoise-painted boat as the sound of a sledgehammer hitting bricks ricochets down the waterway. Others lean out of their windows on one bank of the canal, staring at the growing piles of rubble of what was once rows of homes on the opposite bank. The previous occupants as well as those looking on are a harbinger of thousands who will be forced to leave their homes due to climate change.  Abir Mohamed Abdel-Salam says she doesn’t remember exactly when the canal water first rose above the height of her front window, pouring into her house. “It would reach the top of my thighs,” she says. Black fumes rise overhead from the adjacent petroleum factory.  For years, flooding has been a regular occurrence, and now she knows her emergency response by heart. “First I would send someone to turn off the pumps,” she says, referring to the nearby pumping station designed to prevent flooding on an adjacent coastal road, one driven by wealthy Egyptians en route to their summer homes. “Then we would build a fort inside our house with the furniture.”  The three tiers of crumbling cement houses in El Max once formed the backbone of a 1,000-strong fishing community. But since March, the local authorities have forced half the residents out of their homes and into bleak tower blocks overlooking the canal they once depended on for their livelihood. Those that remain await the demolition of their homes, gazing at the rubble on the opposite bank as a reminder of what awaits them.  Alexandria is a city on the frontline of climate change. According to United Nations figures, even a 50cm sea-level rise will destroy its beaches entirely, while “the Alexandria lowlands – on which the city of Alexandria originally developed – are vulnerable to inundation, waterlogging, increased flooding and salinisation under accelerated sea-level rise”.  The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said that global sea levels are expected to rise by as much as 68cm by 2050, flooding parts of Alexandria and seeping into the groundwater. It will also cause building collapses and force saltwater into vital farmland in the nearby Nile Delta region, destroying livelihoods and forcing more internal displacement.  The plight of El Max’s residents is an early warning sign, the first wave of thousands who will be forced to move due to the effects of climate change on the area, in particular nearby Lake Mariout.  “There are many areas around the lake that are located at least 3m below sea level,” says Alexandrian climate scientist Mohamed El Raey. “[They] will have to be abandoned and the people relocated. In these low-lying areas, there will be hundreds of thousands of people affected by flooding.” El Raey estimates that the government will be forced to move residents in less than 10 years.  These displaced people will form part of a growing global problem. The UN estimates that since 2009, one person every second has been displaced by a climate-change related disaster.  El Max is an unknown corner of the city to many Alexandrians, tucked away between a tangle of concrete overpasses, flat planes of polluted industrial wasteland and dust-choked streets where thick, dark clouds from nearby factories have coated every visible surface. Much of the surrounding area appears almost hostile to human life, despite its placement between the fertile Nile Delta and the Mediterranean coast. The area is known as Alexandria’s own Little Venice, a community of people dependent on the water for their way of life and the rows of pastel-coloured homes that once sustained them. The decades-old informal dwellings are considered “slums” by the local government. The area has also featured in Egyptian film as a place of gangsters and illicit trading, generating rumours of real-world crime. “This is Venice-El Max!” laughs Ahmed Saber, guiding his boat through the soupy brown water on the canal. Pollution from nearby factories has turned it into thick sludge, killing off many of the fish needed for the fishermen to survive. “It feels like Venice – I have a boat like they do in Europe. But it’s all about to be destroyed,” he says, as his boat passes another with rows of teeth painted at the bow to resemble a shark.  Saber, like many others in El Max, has repeatedly refuted signs of flooding that are all around them, from layers of rust on the bars on windows and doors to the water-worn steps that run between the houses. It seemed that admitting to the problem meant taking the side of the local authorities, who they said had been threatening the move for several years.  But by June this year, when half the community were forced to relocate, some residents were willing to be more open about the flooding.  The original problem, explains El Raey, stems from Lake Mariout. “The lake is almost 3m below sea level, so waste water dumping there causes fluctuations in the canal,” he says. “The buildings along the canal are also located below sea level.” The situation is worst in the winter, when the sea level rises. Annual rainfall on Egypt’s coast has recently reached unprecedented levels, such as in 2015, says Dr Khayal Zahra of Egypt’s Coastal Research Institute. “Climate change-related problems meant that the amount of rainfall exceeded 227mm in two days.” The average rainfall had been 250mm a year, for the past 100 years. Excess rainfall exacerbates the rising levels of polluted water in El Max, overloading the nearby pumping station and raising the water levels of the canal until it floods residents’ homes.  But the rising waters on Egypt’s coastline will not affect everyone equally: Egypt’s poorest, living on the water’s edge or dependent on its resources, are vulnerable to the first and worst effects of climate change. They are also the authorities’ frequent target for forced relocation plans aimed at alleged illegal construction in areas they seek to reclaim. “The state is working to end the issue of slums by 2022,” says Mohamed Sultan, a spokesman for the governor of Alexandria, referring to a state-wide initiative by President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi to eradicate informal housing, known as ashwiyyet – urban working class centres often associated with both poverty and social discontent. Although several generations of families live in El Max and have paid rent for decades, the government claims the homes were built illegally and that the only solution is forced relocation, and demolition.  “The governorate has already started relocating the residents to a much safer area,” says Sultan, in reference to an austere cluster of red and sand-bricked tower blocks. The buildings are closer to the nearby beach, putting them in the path of future rising tides. “The previous houses were considered dangerous for the lives of the residents, as the water level increased and entered the homes, risking the lives of those who lived there,” he says.  The governorate insists that a new port will allow residents to fish, and store their equipment. But none of the residents the Guardian speaks to in El Max seem aware of the opportunity, viewing the move as a blow to their way of life and a shove into potential unemployment. They also cite a steep rise in rent, from under £1 a year to almost £9 each month – a sum that is untenable for many. It will mean packing extra family members into homes that residents like Abdel-Salam brand tiny compared with the houses they had before. “The water is an excuse for the government to relocate people,” says Ali Abdel Rahman, a 63-year-old fisherman who sits inside the small blue-and-white-painted hut where he stores his fishing equipment. The room smells of saltwater, and most surfaces are encrusted with either salt, or rust. Outside the shop he sometimes cooks his catch on a small grill, and chats to his neighbours. He is cynical about government promises. “I’m 63. There’s nothing I can do other than fish,” he says. “They say they’re building us new homes – but these houses aren’t homes, they’re just offices,” he adds bitterly.  Abdel Rahman, Abdel-Salam and other residents are certain that their lives in the new tower blocks might be a reprieve from the floods, but that the move will tear them away from their way of life.  “There, we have a sea view – but nothing else,” says Abdel-Salam.

"Italian farmers are in crisis as low prices of wheat, desiccated land and big companies importing grain take their toll. But some have found a solution: growing cannabis. Hemp cultivation has been legal in Italy since 2016, and over the last few years the amount of land dedicated to the plant has increased from 400 hectares (1,000 acres) in 2013 to 4,000 hectares today. The law – which allows cultivation for non-pharmaceutical use of plants with up to 0.2% of the psychoactive compound THC – was introduced with the intention of increasing the development of industrial hemp production. Italians have taken advantage of the legal change to produce not only hemp ricotta and environmentally friendly bricks, but also hemp pasta and biscuits. “The boom in the production of hemp is an excellent example of the ability of agricultural firms to discover new frontiers,” said Roberto Moncalvo, the president of Coldiretti, Italy’s largest farmers’ association. “We are in the middle of an opportunity for economic and employment growth.” Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame? This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come. Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theguardian.com This solution to the crisis affecting Italian farmers can be seen in a small green oasis set in the arid interior of Sicily. Among the clay fields and sheaves of abandoned grain, a sign depicting a seven-point leaf hangs from a gate. Beyond it is Salvo Scuderi, the president of the agricultural cooperative Colli Erei. The 41-year-old has just finished reaping part of his hemp harvest, which will be used to make pasta, oil and flour. This year, Scuderi and 20 other producers of Rete Canapa Sicilia, an association whose goal is to promote and market the use of hemp in the region, have together produced almost 150 tonnes. “Hemp saved our business,” he said. “This year we earned 10 times more than what we used to earn with wheat and it has enabled us to hire four workers.” Wheat yields a profit of €250 (£220) per hectare in today’s market, while hemp can generate net earnings in excess of €2,500 per hectare, according t Rete Canapa Sicilia. And there are many Sicilian farmers who, in order to breathe new life into the dry land and to improve their financial situation have substituted wheat with hemp. In the countryside around Catenanuova, temperatures can reach the mid-40s in the summer. It is where the Italian car manufacturer Fiat used to test its prototypes under high temperatures, scorching weather would force trains to stopbecause of expanding rails. But it is not the heat alone that has caused the desiccation of the land. “Years of monocultural wheat cultivation are the problem,” said Dario Giambalvo, professor of agricultural sciences at the University of Palermo. “It has caused soil erosion, and is at risk of soon making the land infertile.” According to data from Italy’s Council for Agricultural Research and Analysis of Agricultural Economics, land planted with durum wheat decreased by 7.4% in southern Italy last year, and by more than 9% in the north of the country. Overall production decreased by more than 4% during the last year. This is why the move towards to hemp farming could help, say experts. “The cultivation of hemp is a valid opportunity for a diversified farming which can be a good solution for the rebirth of abandoned and less fertile land,” said Giambalvo, “The ancient Romans taught us that diversifying crops can help make the land more fertile. I do not know if this will lead to the growth of the agricultural sector, certainly for Italy is a return to the origins.” Up to the 1940s, Italy was the world’s largest producer of hemp after the Soviet Union. Back then in Italy, more 100,000 hectares were planted with hemp. After the war andthe move towards synthetic fibres, the cultivation of hemp plummeted. The downward trend continued as the campaign against illegal drug use was strengthened. In 1961 the Italian government signed the single convention on narcotic drugs. Despite the international treaty specifically excluding non-pharmaceutical hemp production from the regulations controlling cannabis, it led to further to decline in hemp cultivation in Italy. This could open the way for the legalisation of plant species with levels of psychoactive substances over 0.2% “Hemp has been waiting 60 years to reclaim its rightful place,” said Scuderi. “And this could open the way for the legalisation of plant species with levels of psychoactive substances over 0.2% and to develop pharmaceutical experimentation.” The 2016 law does not prohibit the commercialisation of hemp flowers, a gap that allowed market for the sale of light cannabis to blossom, with more than 500 stores in Italy. The flowers, sealed in bags or jars with names such as Gorilla Blue, Amnesia and Raging Bull, can be collected and used for tisanes or as scents for wardrobes. But the majority of customers simply crumble them, roll them and smoke them. The effects are not as pronounced as most cultivated strains of cannabis, which typically have THC levels of 15-25%, but do offer an immediate sense of relaxation. According to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, Italy ranks third in Europe for consumption of cannabis. On his company’s jars of hemp flowers, Scuderi has placed a label: “pizzo-free”. “It means the product is made without giving a cent to the mafia,” he said. “We launched a clear message: producing cannabis doesn’t mean just regenerating the land; it is also a way to weaken the mafia, which for decades has continued uninhibited in its quest to control the criminal business of drugs trafficking, and to give back to the farmers what the bosses had taken away from them.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

"With the appointment of Angus Taylor as minister for energy, Scott Morrison has clearly signalled that he has no care about reducing greenhouse gas emissions. So utterly bereft of reason on the issue and so completely consumed by climate change denial the government is now at the point where even the pretence of doing something to reduce emissions is viewed with distrust. Perhaps somewhat surprisingly I have a degree of sympathy for members of the public who are climate change deniers. I have this sympathy because I was once one of them.  I don’t mean I was a climate change denier in the sense of believing it all was some gigantic hoax perpetrated by the deep state and the UN. I mean denying in the sense of doing my level best to deny it was happening.  Because it scared the bejeezus out of me.  In the late 1980s and early 1990s when I was finishing high school and studying at university I was of course well aware of climate change. As a politically engaged, super-serious youth who listened to Midnight Oil and U2 and read every newspaper and news magazine I could afford, I was across all the news about the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions.  And it didn’t sound good.  So subconsciously I wanted to ignore it. I would read articles spelling out the dire future ahead and would spend the rest of the day in a depressed funk, because the problem with facing up to the reality of climate change is to face up to the fact that your life thus far has played a role. Your preference for driving a car, the aerosol sprays you used, the food you consumed, or heck, the generation of the electricity you depend upon had all contributed to producing greenhouse gases.  It is real, it is happening, it is getting worse and we need to act It brought with it a level of guilt my 18-year-old self could do without, and even worse, a fear of having to change my lifestyle that I didn’t want to face. And so I would hold on to anything that would suggest it was not so bad. I would cling to those who suggested that each individual couldn’t really make much of a difference (so I can keep those lights switched on). I would inwardly cheer when a friend would (wrongly) suggest he’d read that it was all due to natural factors and things would balance out; or when another would (wrongly) say he’d heard that ironically the hole in the ozone layer apparently cancelled out the impact of global warming, or yet another who would (also wrongly) assert that the changes would in reality be so small that we wouldn’t notice it. And if all else failed I just sighed and thought, well, the impact was likely to happen only by around 2050 or so, and in 1990 to an 18-year-old that meant there was ample time and opportunity for something to get done. Surely a fix would occur – we always end up finding a fix.  And yet ... and yet. I knew I was burying my head in the sand. I was not so much denying the science as wanting to deny reality. The more I read the less able I was to do so. But even now I still get a faint glimmer of hope when I read some dumb article suggesting some research has found evidence that it’s all fine.  Because I don’t want climate change to be a real thing. I would love it to all be a hoax.  But it is not.  And so I understand why people choose to believe those who say climate change is not the issue, that the issue is power prices and thus we need to fire up the coal furnaces.  Denial is a very easy way out of guilt that your lifestyle is leaving your children and grandchildren an awful legacy. Denial is a good way to throw away concerns that you might have to actually wear a cost – either through lifestyle changes or monetary loss.  It is a scary thing to hear talk of the impacts of climate change and the suggestions that it might be too late to do anything. It is so much easier to live in denial, especially when you have charlatans in the media and politics who have seen this fear and have sought to profit from it.  So I have some sympathy for those who feel overwhelmed by it all.  But I have none for those in the media and politics who seek to profit from this fear.  There is no excuse for those trying to lull people into believing it is all a great scam, that there is nothing to worry about, or no need for concern, or that little can or should be done.  According to Nasa, of the 1,663 months since January 1880, the top 100 for temperature anomaly have all occurred since 1990, and every month since December 2014 is in the top 100.  2018 is on track to be the third-hottest year behind 2016 and 2017; fourth is 2015.  It is real, it is happening, it is getting worse and we need to act. And yet this week Taylor gave a speech that made zero mention of wind power – the main renewable energy in Australia – and in which he declared he wasn’t sceptical of climate change, just of subsidies for renewable energy, the Gillard government’s emissions trading scheme and of “excessive renewable energy targets.” This is despite that fact that renewable energy not only reduces our emissions, it also provides cheaper electricity. It’s a bit like the health minister saying she is not an anti-vaxxer, she is just sceptical of the merits of the National Immunisation Program. But don’t worry, it’s unlikely the Morrison government will withdraw from the Paris agreement, because, why bother? It just won’t do anything to actually ensure our emissions targets are achieved. Rather than risk offending those lunatics in his party who would rather destroy a prime ministership than have a policy with even a slight reference to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, Morrison appears to have decided to do nothing.  The costs of responding to climate change increase, the longer it is put off by those whose wilful ignorance sees them continue to proffer policy based on the premise that climate change is fake. We have gone from a government under Malcolm Turnbull that at least tried to look like it was aiming to reduce emissions (even if it wasn’t) to one under Scott Morrison that is making no pretence about the fact it is beholden to the charlatans in the party who want to scam votes by lying about the facts of climate change. And a political party that refuses to act on climate change is not fit to govern. • Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist"
"Individual cities, regions and businesses across the globe are banding together determinedly to confront climate change - but their emissions reductions are relatively small and don’t fully compensate for a recalcitrant US under the Trump administration, a new study has found. A cavalcade of city mayors, regional government representatives and business executives from around the world will convene in San Francisco next month for a major summit touting the role of action beyond national governments to stave off the worst impacts of climate change.  But the greenhouse gas cuts offered up by these entities are relatively modest, according to new research, placing the onus on nations to raise their ambitions even as the US, the world’s second largest emitter, looks to exit the landmark Paris climate agreement. An evaluation of climate change pledges by nearly 6,000 cities, states and regions, representing 7% of the global population, and more than 2,000 companies that have a combined revenue comparable to the size of the US economy, found a total projected reduction of between 1.5bn to 2.2bn tons of greenhouse gases by 2030. In some places this action will be significant, such as in the US, where shifts to cleaner energy and energy efficiency by cities and states are on track to contribute half of the emissions reductions promised by the country in the Paris agreement. But globally these emissions cuts fall short of enabling countries to avoid breaching agreed thresholds for dangerous warming that will trigger increased heatwaves, mightier storms, rising seas and displacement of people. “When we look at the individual pledges [by cities, regions and businesses] the impact isn’t that large so we absolutely need national governments to pull through and do a lot of the heavy lifting,” said Dr Angel Hsu, the director of Data-Driven Yale, which led the study. “The actions of cities, companies and states aren’t insignificant but they can’t do it by themselves. This shows everyone can be doing more. The current reductions are woefully inadequate and hopefully the actions of other entities will give national governments the confidence to be more ambitious.” The analyzed reductions, taken from nine high-emitting countries such as the US, China, India and Brazil, as well as the European Union, overlap with some national efforts that increase the total contribution of emissions cuts. But this action isn’t sufficient to bridge a gap between the Paris agreement’s goal to avoid 2C (3.6F) of global warming, with an aspiration of avoiding a 1.5C increase, and the insufficient emissions reductions put forward by the deal’s nearly 200 national signatories. The agenda of the Trump administration risks making this goal even more challenging. Trump has promised to withdraw the US from the Paris agreement and has unveiled a plan to weaken vehicle emissions standards that could result in more than 1bn tons of extra carbon dioxide over the next 15 years. Last week, Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency announced a watered-down climate policy for the energy sector that might even result in emissions rising from coal plants. Even if every Paris commitment is fully implemented, the world is on track to warm by around 3.3C by the end of the century. Pledges by the likes of Berlin, the Coca-Cola company or even an economic powerhouse like California “while welcome, are not sufficient”, said John Sterman, the director of the MIT system dynamics group. “The world is in a desperate race between accelerating climate change and the innovation needed to cut emissions before it’s too late,” said Sterman. “Cities, states, and business are in the lead, but they face stiff headwinds from weak national policies and the continued efforts of fossil fuel interests to undermine the innovation we need.” Global greenhouse gas emissions rose slightly last year, after a short period of stasis, highlighting the looming scenario whereby as-yet unproven technology will be need to be deployed at a mass scale to suck CO2 directly from the air or capture and bury it after burning vegetation, known as biomass, for energy. “We are already in an overshoot situation and it’s likely we are already going to have to need to remove carbon from the air,” said Klaus Lackner, the director of center for negative carbon emissions at Arizona State University. “The idea we just tighten our belt a bit isn’t going to solve the problem. We need to stop using the atmosphere as a dumping ground, abandon fossil fuels, find other sources of energy and deal with the carbon debt we already have. “Cities getting involved is good and important but we haven’t really acknowledged how big and serious the challenge is. We are whistling in the dark.”"
"Australia’s regional authority and influence is being eroded by its refusal to address the threat climate change poses to many of its Pacific neighbours, according to a pre-eminent climate scientist. As part of the Pacific Islands Forum, Australia was a signatory to the Boe declaration in Nauru on Wednesday which said climate change represented “the single greatest threat to the livelihoods, security and wellbeing of the peoples of the Pacific”.  But Australia attempted to water down the language of the declaration, other Pacific countries have said, resisting language around urgent action to cut emissions, and issued qualifications to part of the Pacific Islands Forum communique over the Paris climate agreement. The prime minister of Tuvalu, Enele Sopoaga, said the name of the country seeking qualifications “[started] with capital A”. Australia is the only country in the PIF beginning with A. Several sources from the PIF forum have corroborated Australia’s efforts to weaken the Boe Declaration. Vanuatu’s minister for foreign affairs Ralph Regenvanu said: “I was there, and can confirm this is true. And unfortunate.” Asked specifically by Guardian Australia whether Australia had sought to weaken the language of the declaration, Australia’s foreign minister Marise Payne neither rejected nor confirmed the allegation. “The communique is an agreed document of the Leaders’ Retreat. It is not appropriate to discuss the internal talks of the private Leaders’ Retreat. Pacific Island Forum leaders’ discussions are typically robust and frank and canvas a broad range of issues, including regional security, economic growth, climate change, fisheries and disaster response.” Payne said Australia understood the centrality of the climate threat to many Pacific Islands, and “the importance that Pacific countries place on effective global action to combat climate change”. Australia has pledged $300 million for climate change action in the Pacific between 2016 and 2020, and has also contributed $200 million to the Green Climate Fund. Dr Bill Hare, managing director of Climate Analytics and a lead author on the IPCC fourth assessment report, told Guardian Australia that Pacific leaders were growing increasingly disenchanted with Australia’s refusal to commit to cutting carbon emissions, even as their nations faced massive economic, physical and social disruption, even existential threat. “The leaders are not fools, and they are increasingly confronted by the problems of climate change, in all its different dimensions,” Hare said. “The problem for Australia is it doesn’t have credibility on climate. Australia is an important player for many of the Pacific Island countries, well-respected and well-liked by the populations and the political leaders, but on climate change there is a chasm opening up. “I hear it from Pacific leaders all the time: they are fighting to save their countries and their people and they cannot understand why the Australian government leadership can’t see the problems they’ve got.” Hare said while the language in the Boe declaration was strong, the real test for Australia would be in its actions to address its own emissions, and in helping the Pacific with adaptation. “The actions will not match the gravity of the declaration or the gravity of the need. There is a credibility gap: Australia is not acting on reducing its own emissions. All the leaders know that whenever the prime minister or energy minister says Australia will meet its Paris targets ‘in a canter’, that that it is wrong, it is factually incorrect – it is bullshit. “They know Australia is working to slow down action on meeting Paris targets, they know Australia is promoting coal, and they know it’s going to cause a climate catastrophe. Australia has dedicated and able diplomats across the region, but the political leadership of the government is so far removed from reality, it opens up major problems for the country.” Pacific leaders were confronting losing large proportions of their territory, and the forcible displacement of their populations, Hare said. He said leaders did not want their next generations to grow up dislocated, living in foreign cities like Sydney and Auckland, with the attendant loss of identity, culture and self-esteem. Support for Australia could ebb away, with Pacific Islands looking to other benefactors – in particular China – which has made massive in its aid spending and diplomatic engagement in the region. China is set to overtake Australia as the largest donor to the Pacific, after pledging US$4bn in aid to the region last year. But climate action is acutely politically sensitive for the Australian government, having just abandoned the National Energy Guarantee - which would have mandated emissions cuts - and new prime minister Scott Morrison facing pressure from some members within his own party to abandon Australia’s Paris agreement targets. Morrison said specific emissions reductions targets were not necessary to meet Australia’s Paris goals: “the business-as-usual model gets us there in a canter”. That directly contradicts advice from the government’s own Energy Security Board that says business as usual will mean the electricity sector will “fall short of the emissions reduction target of 26% below 2005 levels”. The Australian Conservation Foundation chief executive officer, Kelly O’Shanassy, said Australia’s Boe declaration commitment was welcomed but must be matched by domestic action. “It’s not surprising that Pacific leaders have been unhappy with Australia on climate change with the Morrison government turning up at the Pacific Islands Forum with no real plan to cut our domestic pollution and without a clear indication that it intends to develop one.” Ahead of the Pacific Islands Forum, Xavier Matsutaro, the national climate change coordinator for Palau, said Australia’s relationship with the Pacific was “dysfunctional” and akin to an abusive spouse, saying Australia was also responsible for diluting the strength of previous regional declarations on climate change. “Australia is a bit of an anomaly, because on the floor [of climate summits] they’re basically sometimes as far right as Trump in some of their views on climate change … but then on a regional basis they’ve actually given a lot of support to our region.” Hare said Matsutaro spoke the “real and growing truth” about Pacific sentiment towards Australia. “It reflects a major political and diplomatic crisis in the Pacific. If Pacific leaders lose faith in Australia, then they will turn to others, and this is already becoming a major source of discussion. Pacific leaders are not naive about the strings that will come with development from China, but they are beginning to feel abandoned.”"
"Tens of thousands of people around the world will mobilise over the weekend of 8-9 September under the banner of Rise for Climate, a grassroots movement seeking a fossil fuel free world.  More than 600 events are planned in at least 80 countries, with one of the key aims to challenge the decision-makers attending the Global Climate Summit in California on 12 September to escalate decarbonisation efforts and targets.

"A European parliament report that blames climate change on cosmic ray fluctuations, sunspots and planetary gravitational pulls, is so hackneyed and ill-informed it would “make the dinosaurs blush,” climate scientists say. The non-binding opinion written by Ukip MEP, John Stuart Agnew, has shocked EU lawmakers for its dismissal of climate science – and the support he received to write it from mainstream rightwing and liberal political blocs.  Green MEP Molly Scott Cato said their choice of Agnew, a Norfolk farmer, as parliamentary rapporteur by the agriculture committee, was a “truly scandalous” fiasco that illustrated a growing populist threat. A rapporteur is elected to shepherd EU proposals through the European parliament and, after negotiations with the European commission and EU states, into law. The Agnew report calls for a €5.45bn green fund called Life to be used to prepare “for an impending Maunder Minimum” – or a period of low sunspot activity. It deletes the European commission’s proposals for funds to be spent on clean energy infrastructure, references to climate mitigation and obligations under the Paris agreement. Agnew claimed that his ideas represented scientific “fact”. He said: “I’m doing this to ensure that somewhere in the files and annals of the European parliament there was somebody who said: ‘The king isn’t wearing an invisible suit! The king is naked!’” Rather than human activity, the Agnew report attributes climate change to cosmic ray fluctuations and gravitational pulls from elsewhere in the galaxy, sunspot activity, ocean currents and greenhouse gas water vapour, in the form of cloud cover. “The other greenhouse gases, CO2, methane and nitrous oxide have a negligible effect on our climate,” Agnew’s paper claims. “The only potential risk of a major CO2 event in Europe is an erupting volcano.” Dave Reay, professor of carbon management at Edinburgh University told the Guardian, after looking at the paper: “It is fitting that this laughable document misuses palaeoclimate information in its case against human-induced climate change – the hackneyed, pseudo-scientific arguments here would make the dinosaurs blush.” Agnew’s paper has no legal weight and will almost certainly be dismissed by the environment committee when the issue is debated on 30 August. In part, it reflects a turf war between the agriculture and environment panels over responsibility for separate proposals on greening obligations under the next CAP. But with fears of an influx of far-right MEPs in parliamentary elections next year growing, Agnew’s success has also set alarm bells ringing. Scott Cato told the Guardian it was “shocking” to think that someone with his climate views could influence funding disbursements. “It’s truly scandalous that a proud climate denier has got control of such an important file,” she said. “This fiasco shows the damage that can be done by electing populists who really have no understanding of their brief and are not competent to undertake the highly influential and detailed work that is required of elected politicians.” Agnew has long campaigned against what he terms “the global warming scam”. He has also drawn attention for claiming thousands of pounds in CAP payments for his Norfolk farm every month, according to his members’ declaration. He told the Guardian that “I threw my hat in the ring to do this [report] fully expecting to be thrown out of court,” but that he then received wide support, “to my genuine astonishment”. A spokesman for the European People’s Party said their backing for Agnew was due to bidding procedures and not an endorsement of his climate politics. Agnew was also supported by the European Conservatives and Reformists bloc of mostly Conservative MEPs and far-right Europe of Nations and Freedom faction. The Socialists opposed Agnew and the Greens stood against him, but they were hampered by the abstention of the far left GUE group and support for Agnew from the ALDE bloc of Liberals. Two ALDE MEP’s contacted by the Guardian declined to comment."
"The existential threat of climate change is being spelled out to New Yorkers via a selection of flashing highway signs that have been placed around the city. The 10 large solar-powered signs have been placed in locations in each of New York’s five boroughs, including areas deemed particularly vulnerable to the sea level rise and powerful storms associated with climate change, including the Rockaways in Queens and the west side of Manhattan.  Messages such as “Climate change at work” and “Climate denial kills” will be displayed in English, as well as in languages commonly spoken in the areas they will be deployed, such as Spanish, Russian and French. The signs are part of a project by the Climate Museum and a host of partners, including the New York City’s mayor’s office. The installation, called Climate Signals, has been done by Justin Brice Guariglia, an artist who regularly focuses on environmental themes in his work. “These signs sound a warning about the climate crisis and they call us to think and act on the issue,” said Miranda Massie, director of the Climate Museum. “When you see a flashing traffic signal your initial response is that there are uncertain conditions ahead, and that is exactly what climate change is. This is the perfect medium for bringing up this alert.” Some of the sites will include elements such as voter registration and appearances by climate scientists. Massie said the work is not overtly activist in nature, despite the unfolding agenda of Donald Trump, a native of Queens, to dismiss the science of climate change and dismantle policies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. “Anyone who is aware of the climate crisis is appalled and alarmed by the disgraceful assault by the administration on climate progress,” she said. “But this project isn’t political in a narrow sense, it’s about social and cultural action. We need a social shift to deal with climate change. It shouldn’t be a political lightning rod.” Daniel Zarrilli, New York City’s chief resilience officer, said: “Climate change is one of New York City’s greatest challenges and requires creative approaches to educate and engage all of us about its risks and solutions. Art can play a valuable role in this effort.” Climate Signals will be visible across New York City until 6 November"
"Australia attempted to water down a resolution on climate change agreed by country representatives at the Pacific Islands Forum, a leader attending the event has claimed.Pacific leaders issued the Boe declaration on Wednesday night, calling climate change “the single greatest threat to the livelihoods, security and wellbeing of the peoples of the Pacific” at the conclusion of the Pacific Islands Forum, which has been held in Nauru this week. However the forum communique – which focused heavily on climate change and the need for emissions reductions – was endorsed by leaders “with qualification”.  When asked at a press conference if those qualifications came from a country “beginning with A”, Enele Sopoaga, the prime minister of Tuvalu, confirmed that “the name of the qualifier, seeking qualifications [started] with capital A”. Australia is the only nation in the Pacific to fit this description.It appears Australia also did not support a section of agreement calling on the United States to return to the Paris agreement on climate change. The communique made it clear that it was only “leaders of forum island countries” – a term that a forum spokesperson confirmed denoted all forum member countries other than Australia and New Zealand – who called on the US to return to the Paris agreement on climate change. A spokesperson from the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said: “I can confirm that NZ absolutely supports the reference in the communique calling for the US to return to the Paris agreement.” Guardian Australia has sought comment from the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.Sopoaga said it was essential the US return to the agreement and commit to reducing emissions.“We cannot have comprehensive robust emissions reductions unless the biggest emitter is there in the process, we cannot leave the US out, they are responsible for 25% of global emissions,” he said. The Boe declaration committed all forum countries to meeting their Paris agreement targets – a question of fierce domestic political debate in Australia. “Leaders reaffirmed the importance of immediate urgent action to combat climate change and … called on countries, particularly large emitters, to fully implement their … mitigation targets,” the declaration said. The president of host nation Nauru, Baron Waqa, said despite the fact the declaration included a qualification from Australia “that doesn’t make it any weaker”. But the Australian government’s apparent ambivalence towards a low-emissions climate policy has disquieted its Pacific neighbours. Low-lying island Pacific countries including Kiribati are forecast to be among the first on the planet to disappear underwater if rising sea levels are not arrested.Australia’s attempts to resist the strong language in the Boe declaration fits with its past behaviour at international meetings, according to a Pacific climate change representative who has represented his nation at COP summits for the last five years.Speaking to Guardian Australia ahead of the Pacific Islands Forum, Xavier Matsutaro, the national climate change coordinator for Palau, in the north-west Pacific, said Australia was “responsible for making our declarations weaker sometimes in the region”.“So there’s been forums that were formulated so [Australia] won’t be involved in it, they’re not members, so that whatever language that really reflects our views and our circumstances is actually reflected in the declaration,” he said. He also likened Australia to an ""abusive spouse"", saying Australia provided aid to the region to deal with the effects of global warming but undermining attempts to halt its progress.

"California’s summer of deadly wildfires and dangerous heatwaves will soon be the new normal if nothing is done to stop climate change, a report released on Monday warns.  City heatwaves could lead to two to three times as many deaths by 2050, the report says. By 2100, without a reduction in emissions, the state could see a 77% increase in the average area burned by wildfires. The report also warns of erosion of up to 67% of its famous coastline, up to an 8.8F (4.9C) rise in average maximum temperatures, and billions of dollars in damages.  “These findings are profoundly serious and will continue to guide us as we confront the apocalyptic threat of irreversible climate change,” said the state’s governor, Jerry Brown, in a tweet about the report, the fourth statewide climate change assessment released since 2006. Rising temperaturescould lead to up to 11,300 additional deaths in 2050, the report says, and the overall number of days marked by extreme heat will “increase exponentially in many areas”. The effects of those extreme heat days will probably weigh most heavily on the state’s most vulnerable residents, including the more than 100,000 people who are homeless in California, many of whom live on the streets without reliable access to fans, air conditioners, or running water. “The 2006 heatwave killed over 600 people, resulted in 16,000 emergency department visits, and led to nearly $5.4bn in damages,” the assessment reports. “The human cost of these events is already immense, but research suggests that mortality risk for those 65 or older could increase tenfold by the 2090s because of climate change.” The California energy commission chairman, Robert Weisenmiller, said: “It really forces you to think through what do we do about the more elderly – the more endangered.” The commission was one of three agencies that published the report. “How do we protect them during these intense heat periods?” As researchers point out in a summary of the findings, cooling mechanisms such as air conditioners can help mitigate the effects of intense heatwaves, but increased electrical consumption can also drive up the emissions responsible for climate change in the first place. And the double threat of wildfires and increased energy consumption can endanger a power grid vital in a crisis. The “apocalyptic threat” the governor described would present itself in myriad ways in a state prone to extreme weather events like drought and wildfires, said Amir AghaKouchak, an associate professor at the University of California, Irvine, and a researcher who contributed to the assessment. As climate change progresses, AghaKouchak said, overall rainfall would probably remain the same, but it would come in the form of extreme storms followed by longer periods without rain. “There will be two consequences: one is more potentially extreme floods, and the other is problems with drought management.” Intense rainfall after a season of wildfires could also mean more landslides similar to the deadly mudslides in Santa Barbara earlier this year, AghaKouchak said. More rain coming in short bursts was likely to aggravate water management problems in a state already stricken by drought. And drought areas – including much of California – have been shown to warm faster than others, he said. The North Fork Mono tribe chairman, Hon Ron Goode, who also contributed to the assessment, said it was the first time the state’s native population had been included in the report, despite the fact that native Californians were among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. But before colonization, Goode said, the native population would not have been so vulnerable, because it was more mobile and could nimbly adapt to changes in the climate. “They knew how to move around and where to go and let something rest,” he said. “Now, it’s different. We’re locked into our reservations; rancherias; allotment lands. We can’t just run away – those are our lands and that’s it.” The report offers some suggestions of how to mitigate the disastrous effects it predicts, Weisenmiller said, from land use planning to reducing California’s greenhouse gas emissions, just under half of which come from transportation. “The good news is that it’s not ‘here’s the dire impact’, but ‘here’s some ways to mitigate the dire impacts’. It should give people some hope,” Weisenmiller said. But Goode said he was not sure whether to be hopeful. “I won’t say that I’m hopeful. I would like to feel hopeful, but I don’t see it happening right now,” he said. “I don’t see the politicians stumbling over themselves to make that change.”"
"The BBC has accepted it gets coverage of climate change “wrong too often” and told staff: “You do not need a ‘denier’ to balance the debate.” In a briefing note sent to all staff warning them to be aware of false balance, the corporation has offered a training course on how to report on global warming. The move follows a series of apologies and censures for failing to challenge climate sceptics during interviews, including Nigel Lawson.  The briefing note, obtained by the website Carbon Brief, was sent on Thursday by Fran Unsworth, the BBC’s director of news and current affairs. It includes a statement of BBC editorial policy that begins: “Climate change has been a difficult subject for the BBC, and we get coverage of it wrong too often.” It then states: “Manmade climate change exists: If the science proves it we should report it.” In the section warning on false balance it says: “To achieve impartiality, you do not need to include outright deniers of climate change in BBC coverage, in the same way you would not have someone denying that Manchester United won 2-0 last Saturday. The referee has spoken.” The Guardian revealed in October that the BBC had apologised for an interview with Lord Lawson on the Radio 4 Today programme after admitting it had breached its own editorial guidelines for allowing him to claim that global temperatures have not risen in the past decade. The regulator Ofcom subsequently ruled the BBC had breached broadcasting rules. The Today programme was also censured by the BBC complaints unit for an interview with Lawson in February 2014 and has been criticised for failing to implement fully the findings of the BBC Trust’s 2011 review into the “accuracy of the BBC’s coverage of science”. The four-page briefing note sent by Unsworth starts with a blunt statement on the science: “Climate change IS happening.” It also covers the implications of global warming: “There is a general consensus that it could be devastating in many different ways.” It ends with “common misconceptions” used to deny manmade warming, including that “not all scientists think manmade climate change is real” and “climate change has happened before”. The briefing note does not completely rule out including climate sceptics in BBC coverage: “There are occasions where contrarians and sceptics should be included. These may include, for instance, debating the speed and intensity of what will happen in the future, or what policies government should adopt.” But it adds: “Journalists need to be aware of the guest’s viewpoint and how to challenge it effectively. As with all topics, we must make clear to the audience which organisation the speaker represents, potentially how that group is funded and whether they are speaking with authority from a scientific perspective.” Lawson’s Global Warming Policy Foundation does not disclose its source of funding. Richard Black, director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit thinktank and a former BBC environment correspondent, said: “The creation of this course is welcome news. The BBC was wrong in my view to scrap the science seminars that it set up in 2011 – very few producers and presenters have a science background. “The course will be criticised by some – words like ‘stifling the debate’ – but those voices are decreasingly important in the country. I think the real takeaway from this is that the BBC has decided it no longer cares about evidence-free allegations of ‘bias’. It’s to be commended for putting its mojo on display.” Prof Ed Hawkins, a climate scientist at the University of Reading, said: “This set of BBC guidelines is long overdue. There have been too many occasions when the BBC’s audience has been misled over the realities of climate change.” Hawkins analysed the briefing note for Carbon Brief saying: “The ‘editorial policy’ could be more explicit about what would constitute false balance in its coverage. In the past, too many inaccurate statements made about climate science have not been effectively challenged by the interviewer.” In August, 57 prominent environmentalists, including Jonathon Porritt and Caroline Lucas, wrote to the Guardian declaring: “We will no longer debate those who deny that human-caused climate change is real. There are plenty of vital debates to be had around climate chaos and what to do about it; this is simply no longer one of them. We urge broadcasters to move on, as we are doing.” The BBC declined to offer further comment."
"Australia does not need to quit the Paris climate agreement because our commitments are non-binding, and new coal plants can continue to be constructed, according to the resources minister, Matt Canavan. Canavan told Sydney broadcaster Alan Jones on Friday he had never been to Paris, and was “happy to leave the Champs-Élysées for others”, but people needed to be clear the treaty Tony Abbott committed Australia to in 2015 “doesn’t actually bind us to anything in particular”.  Abbott said in 2015, when he announced Australia would be signing up, that the government was making a “definite commitment” to a 26% reduction in emissions by 2030 and “with the circumstances that we think will apply ... we can go up to 28%”. But Canavan said on Friday the Paris commitment was a three-page document that allowed Australia flexibility to build new coal plants. The resources minister said rather than focusing on the situation in 2030, “what I want to focus on is solving the crisis we have in energy today”. “We have to build power stations. There’s nothing in the [Paris] agreement that would stop us building power stations, including coal-fired power stations,” Canavan said. “We need new ones”. Canavan said Queensland was “propping up” New South Wales with the newest coal fleet in the country. Jones prefaced his interview with Canavan with a long condemnation of the new foreign minister, Marise Payne, and the decision to sign on to a communique at the Pacific Islands Forum this week nominating climate change as the single greatest security threat to the Pacific. The communique said all countries must meet their commitments under the Paris climate agreement. Jones declared the prime minister, Scott Morrison, needed to “recall Marise Payne and replace her”. He said the Morrison government would have no hope of winning the next federal election if it wanted to “persist with the global warming rubbish and the Paris agreement”. The 2GB host said Paris needed to be “ripped up”. “Do you want to win an election or don’t you?” Jones said to Canavan on Friday morning. Canavan dead-batted. “Of course I want to win the election, Alan. But, more importantly, what I want to do is have good policies for Australia and make our country strong”. The Queensland Nationals have been campaigning for months for government backing for new coal plants. In his first major speech in the energy portfolio, the new minister, Angus Taylor, signalled he wanted to encourage new investment extending the life of existing coal and gas plants, and upgrading ageing facilities. Taylor said the government was intent on boosting supply, and that meant expanding existing plants, upgrading ageing “legacy” generators, as well as pursuing new “greenfield” projects. Taylor is currently working up options for cabinet. A recent forecast by the Australian Energy Market Operator predicted 30% of Australia’s coal generators will approach the end of their technical life over the next two decades, and it said it was important to avoid premature departures if the looming transition in the national energy market is to be orderly. But it was also clear that the most economical replacement for the ageing coal fleet was not new coal, but “a portfolio of utility-scale renewable generation, storage, distributed energy resources, flexible thermal capacity, and transmission”. Aemo concluded that mix of generation could produce 90 terawatt hours of energy per annum, “more than offsetting the energy lost from retiring coal-fired generation”."
"Tens of thousands of people took part in marches and other events across the US on Saturday, calling for a swift transition to renewable energy in order to stave off the various perils of climate change.  The Rise for Climate protests was spearheaded by what organizers called the largest ever climate march on the US west coast. The march, which snaked through the heart of San Francisco, came ahead of a climate change summit in the city next week that will gather mayors and business leaders from around the world. The San Francisco march, which called for California governor Jerry Brown to end fossil fuel extraction in the state, attracted around 30,000 people, organizers said. An array of activities, including rallies, voter registration drives and vigils, were scheduled to take place across the US, in cities such as Boston, Miami and Portland, Oregon. Events were also planned in Puerto Rico. In New Orleans, protesters planned to agitate for the halt of the Bayou Bridge pipeline, an extension of the controversial Dakota Access project that last year spurred a lengthy standoff at the Standing Rock reservation. Hundreds of other actions took place in cities around the world, as part of a coordinated effort to counter what climate activists see as the dangerously regressive policies of Donald Trump’s administration, which has sought to dismantle rules to lower greenhouse gas emissions and has thrown open vast areas of land and water to drilling. “Today, people across the country are rising up for climate, jobs and justice in their communities to fight back against Trump’s toxic agenda and to send a message to every politician that the time for action is now,” said Michael Brune, executive director of environment group the Sierra Club. “Families living in the shadows of coal plants and oil refineries, losing homes and livelihoods to wildfires and extreme weather, and struggling to make a living wage are coming together because we know we don’t have time to waste.” The activists’ ire is largely aimed at governors who though relatively progressive on climate issues, such as Brown and New York governor Andrew Cuomo, are deemed not to be ambitious enough in phasing out fossil fuels. On Thursday, several thousand people took part in a climate march in New York City. Ten activists were arrested after blocking the street in front of Cuomo’s Manhattan office. A week of protests are planned surrounding the summit in San Francisco, with organizers hoping to draw attention to air pollution and social inequity that has tainted California’s economic growth. “Climate change, economic inequality, the housing crisis, increased criminalization, attacks on immigrant communities – all these challenges are driven by systemic devaluation of the lives of people of color and choosing profit over people and the planet,” said Gladys Limon, executive director of the California Environmental Justice Alliance. “We are standing up to life destructive industries, from big oil to natural gas companies, that obstruct progress toward a healthy, sustainable and just society.”"
"California has given fossil fuel-derived energy a hefty shove towards obsolescence after legislators voted to require that 100% of the state’s electricity come from carbon-free sources. The bill, which will need to be approved by the state senate and Governor Jerry Brown, will require a complete shift to clean energy such as solar and wind by 2045. It would also demand that electric utilities source 60% of their power from renewable sources by 2030, up from the current target of 50%. California ridding itself entirely of carbon-intensive energy has been a politically vexed proposition for the past two years, with state Republicans arguing it was unfeasible and would drive up electricity prices. But the state has emerged as a bastion of defiance to the Trump administration on climate change, among other issues, as it has been scorched by record wildfires and a prolonged drought. A report released this week warned that the state is on course for punishing heatwaves, thousands of additional deaths and the erosion of two thirds of its coastline due to rising temperatures, wildfires and sea level rise.  Brown has already set out ambitious goals to expand renewables and the use of electric cars. The state legislature has already passed a law that requires newly built homes to be equipped for solar power. In July, the state announced its greenhouse gas emissions were lower than in 1990, despite a growing economy. The bill to go 100% renewable energy was authored by state senator Kevin de Leon, who called it a “victory for clean air. It’s a victory to tackle climate change and the devastation that it’s leaving in its wake.” Brown has yet to confirm he will sign the bill his predecessor as governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, wrote to lawmakers to back the legislation and urge them to be “undeterred by those who wish to stop our progress and move backwards”. California becomes the second US state, after Hawaii, to call for carbon-free electricity by 2045. The clout of the Californian economy could help spur some other states, such as Massachusetts and New Jersey, to do the same. Environmentalists hailed the vote as a landmark moment. “This is a pivotal moment for California, for the country, and the world,” said Michael Brune, the executive director of the Sierra Club.  “California is showing the world that moving to 100% clean energy is within our reach and what bold climate leadership looks like in the face of a Trump administration.” California currently sources around a third of its electricity from clean sources. Opponents of the 100% renewable bill warned that electricity prices would go up if the state relied too heavily upon intermittent solar and wind before energy storage improves."
"The real question that should mark the 10th anniversary of the financial crash is a moral one: what was finance for, what was investment for, what was corporate activity for, in 2008, and what is it for now? So far, analyses have focused on two dimensions of the crisis. First, whether enough was subsequently done, in terms of new regulation and technical fixes such as ringfencing the banks, to prevent a repeat meltdown. And second, a focus on the consequences – the global political upheaval that came in its wake, or more precisely, the decade of immiseration that the briefly thrilling, phosphorous destruction unleashed. Both approaches risk being a distraction. The next crisis most likely won’t come from improperly supervised instruments of speculative finance. The Economist, for example, suggests the risks lie in the level of household borrowing and the euro. And while it is impossible to avoid asking whether the super-rich simply walked away from the wreckage, laughing as they left societies trying to hold themselves together through painful austerity, the answer generates resentment and a lust for revenge. To know that a disproportionate concentration of wealth is destabilising as well as unjust does not give us a meaningful or creative blueprint for the future we want to build. That post-crash principle should be this: in a century in which the sustainability of the planet is at stake, markets cannot survive without morality. Ten years ago, “ethical” investing meant not buying shares in arms and alcohol, as if morality were so unfamiliar to financial decision-making that you had to go back to the 19th century and borrow it from the Quakers. The growth of banks with a moral mission – like Triodos (“quality of life, human dignity, sustainability”) – or investments with a social purpose – like Abundance, which finances renewable energy – has been impressive on its own terms, but remained niche, for baby boomers with a conscience. The idea that all market activity should have a purpose other than profit is roughly where it always was on the spectrum, somewhere between Marx and Jesus – one for the rioters, the subversives, the people with beards, unsuited to mainstream discourse. But there is nothing more pragmatic and less idealistic than to insist on the social purpose of the market; banking cannot survive without it – not as a corporate bolt-on but as its driving and decisive motivation. The derivatives trade cannot weather the consequences of infinite self-interest, because there really will be consequences – extreme global ones. The planet cannot survive an endless cost-benefit analysis in which nature is pitted against profit. Nature will always lose and so will humanity as a result. Whatever the immediate cause of the next crash, if and when it comes its roots will be environmental. The Financial Times talks about “the insidious danger that pension funds deflate, leaving a generation without enough money to retire”. The most likely cause for that devaluation of pensions – leaving aside the generation that cannot afford to save for the future – will be stranded assets, pension funds having invested in fossil fuels that cannot be excavated. Even under the terms of the Paris climate accord, which most agree is under-ambitious, 80% of known coal reserves, one-third of oil and half of gas will have to be left in the ground if we are to meet our targets on climate change. The writedowns will be staggering. For a period after the crash, institutions that thought themselves ethical – universities, churches, pension funds with “ethical” in the name – practised divestment, ridding their portfolios of fossil fuels and its attendant industries. The stance never became the norm; funds that would call themselves reputable still have the farm bet on investments whose realisation would mean the end of the habitable world. The Lehman Brothers debacle may have had a million misjudgments feeding into it, corruption and carelessness commingling, but the toxicity of the subprime mortgage was laid bare by Hurricane Katrina. In New Orleans, about one-third of mortgages affected by Katrina were sub-prime. Whether it’s a refugee crisis or a tsunami, a heatwave or a flood, the effects of climate change refuse to stick to their own category: they throw up political schisms, social discord, radical departures from the old order of stability from which the financial system cannot remain aloof. There is no MBA module with a solution, and no regulatory lever to mitigate this: all financial endeavour has to be reimagined with the future of humanity as its explicit purpose. Profit was the answer to another century’s problems; if we don’t learn this from 2008, the lessons of 2028 will be far harsher. • Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist"
"Climate change is the single greatest security threat to the Pacific, and all countries must meet their commitments under the Paris climate agreement, the 18 countries of the Pacific Islands Forum said on Wednesday. The first assertion of the strongly worded Boe Declaration says all Pacific nations, including Australia, “reaffirm that climate change remains the single greatest threat to the livelihoods, security and wellbeing of the peoples of the Pacific, and our commitment to progress the implementation of the Paris agreement. “Leaders reaffirmed the importance of immediate urgent action to combat climate change and … called on countries, particularly large emitters, to fully implement their … mitigation targets, including through the development and transfer of renewable energy, in line with committed timeframes.” Leaders of the Forum Islands countries also called for the US to return to the Paris agreement and the commitments it made under President Barack Obama. The Boe Declaration said the security challenges being faced by Pacific nations were broader and more complex than in previous generations. The forum committed its members to addressing humanitarian assistance, environmental and resource security, transnational crime and cybersecurity. Australia will work with regional security agencies to establish a Pacific Fusion Centre to better share intelligence and target threats including illegal fishing, drug trafficking and other cross-border crimes. But the forthright declaration on climate is awkward politically for Australia, with its new prime minister, Scott Morrison, apparently at odds with his own government’s Energy Security Board over whether Australia will meet its Paris targets of a 26% reduction in emissions from 2005 levels. The government does not have any emissions reductions policies in place to achieve the target. Morrison told a radio program on Wednesday that “the business-as-usual model gets us there [meeting the Paris targets] in a canter”. But the Energy Security Board said business as usual – and a failure to implement the now-discarded national energy guarantee – would mean the electricity sector would “fall short of the emissions reduction target of 26% below 2005 levels”. The Australian government’s apparent ambivalence towards a low-emissions climate policy has disquieted its Pacific neighbours. As a region, the Pacific has produced the least carbon of any areaon Earth but its citizens have felt the impacts of climate change first, and most acutely, through rising seas, increased salinity, and more frequent and severe natural disasters. Low-lying island Pacific countries including Kiribati are forecast to be among the first on the plant to disappear underwater if rising sea levels are not arrested. Xavier Matsutaro, the national climate change coordinator for Palau, a small nation in the north-west Pacific, told the Guardian Australia’s relationship with the Pacific was “dysfunctional”, adding that Australia was also responsible for diluting the strength of previous regional declarations on climate change. “Australia is a bit of an anomaly, because on the floor [of climate summits] they’re basically sometimes as far right as Trump in some of their views on climate change, at one point they even denied that it existed … But then on a regional basis they’ve actually given a lot of support to our region,” Matsutaro said. “Sometimes the way I think about it ... it’s like you’re in a relationship and you get abused by your spouse but at the same time they feed you and clothe you and things like that,” he said. “You could say it’s a bit of a dysfunctional relationship.” In a blistering speech in Sydney last month, Samoa’s prime minister, Tuilaepa Sailele, called climate change an “existential threat ... for all our Pacific family” and said any world leader who denied climate change’s existence was “utterly stupid”."
"The trade minister, Simon Birmingham, has claimed Australia will honour its Paris climate agreement commitments but failed to name a mechanism for emissions reduction in government policy. In the wake of the Coalition government removing the emissions reduction component from its signature national energy guarantee before Scott Morrison replaced Malcolm Turnbull, the issue is shaping up as a major test before the Wentworth byelection. Turnbull’s son Alex has spruiked for donations on behalf of Labor’s candidate Tim Murray, citing energy policy as a key consideration when the progressive Liberal inner-city electorate goes to the polls. On Sunday Birmingham said that Morrison “has made very clear we will continue to honour our commitments” including the Paris climate agreement, as Australia had done for the first and second round of Kyoto targets. “We continually see, in terms of that abatement target required to meet the 2030 targets, that gap is closing with each update and we’ll continue to work on the policy settings to make sure that is achieved,” he told Sky News. Asked if this would include emissions reduction in the electricity, agriculture or transport industry, Birmingham said the government would “encourage adoption of new technologies and new practices, all of which have played a big role meeting targets to date”. “We will continue to watch closely in terms of the projections around the abatement task and work hard to make sure Australia meets and fulfils our obligations.” On Saturday Scott Morrison said that Australia’s commitments to its Paris targets “haven’t changed”. “Australia stands on its record. I mean, we hit our first target, exceeded it by 128m tonnes,” he told reporters in Indonesia. “We’re on track to meet our second Kyoto target and exceed it by 294m tonnes.” Alex Turnbull has intervened in the Wentworth campaign over the issue of energy policy, calling for donations Labor’s candidate for Wentworth on Twitter. He cited the need for a federal integrity commission, donations reform and a “sane energy policy”. Best bang for the buck you'll get in political donations in your life. Tight race, tight margin for government, big incremental effect whatever happens. If you want a federal election now this is the means by which to achieve it. https://t.co/YgTQGhQwBa At a press conference in Sydney, Morrison played down Turnbull’s intervention, suggesting that “I’m sure Alex’s only message today is happy father’s day to Malcolm”. Asked if it was odd that Turnbull’s son was seeking donations for the Labor candidate, Morrison said it “strikes [him] as a democracy”. Far from staying silent on Sunday, Turnbull doubled down on his earlier comments, arguing that “the market disagrees” with the proposition that the Liberal Party’s energy policy will reduce wholesale prices. “Paris agreement had zero impact on prices [by the way],” he said. Turnbull argued that energy market participants had an incentive to correctly predict the trajectory of prices. “It is crystal clear what those with the right incentives think about what scrapping the Neg means – prices will rise.” On Sunday the former member for Wentworth – Liberal Peter King – signalled his intention to seek preselection.  Appearing on Sky New’s Outsiders, King suggested the ideal candidate for Wentworth would be someone with experience, “not associated with big business”, with resources and “campaign muscle” who has shown “through his public record he has the long-term interests of the community at heart”. King did not articulate a vision for emissions reduction, instead focusing on the need to lower power prices. “We’re exporting our coal and our gas to India and China, they’re then using it to produce cheap power and selling back products to us at a higher rate – so we lose out twice,” he said. King argued that renewable energy is given $2.8bn a year in subsidies – a figure generated by the Minerals Council most of which is accounted for by solar feed-in tariffs provided by state governments. King suggested that blockchain technology could be used so that “if you want to pay more for green power, fine, but if you’re doing it tough or want to pay less you ought to have that opportunity too”."
"Britain has thousands fewer electric car charging points than required because councils are frustrating their rollout, according to one of the country’s biggest energy companies. Big six energy firm SSE said that when it started work three years ago, it had hoped to install 6,000 charging points in London by now, but had fitted just 762 because of delays by local authorities.  The company is the contractor putting in the chargers for the Source London network, run by French firm Bolloré. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has backed electric vehicle infrastructure to help clean up the capital’s dirty air, but his rhetoric has reportedly not filtered down to the local level. Slow decision-making and bureaucracy in councils, coupled with different approaches to charge points across the capital’s boroughs, are understood to have hamstrung the rollout. Kevin Welstead, the sector director for electric vehicles at SSE Enterprise, said: “Progress has not been rapid. The issue is that we have to effectively negotiate with each of the 33 individual London boroughs so we can install charge points alongside their parking bays and some are more progressive on the electric vehicle agenda than others.” The Guardian understands that 130 charging points are in limbo in Southwark, a borough which is otherwise seen as good on electric cars. While the points were given planning approval in 2016, permission has not been given by highways management, meaning they cannot be installed. Planning permission expires next year. Welstead said ministers and Khan had rightly supported electric vehicles, but added: “Our experience as an infrastructure provider on the ground is that this message has not seeped all the way through.” One possible reason for holdups could be the financial problems that austerity has imposed. Cuts to central government grants have led local authorities to shed staff, including those on transport teams, and remaining staff are understood to be stretched to capacity.

There has also reportedly been a growth in very localised opposition, including in conservation areas. However, there are hotspots of demand for charging points, including Camden, Islington, Kensington & Chelsea, Hammersmith & Fulham and Southwark. The mayor of London launched an electric vehicle infrastructure taskforce in May, focused on “rapid chargers”, not the slower chargers that comprise most of the Source London network. There are nearly 4,000 charging points in London, according to Zap Map. London Councils, which represents the city’s 33 boroughs, denied holding back the switch to electric cars. Councillor Julian Bell, who chairs the group’s transport and environment committee, said: “London boroughs are committed to supporting environmentally friendly transport and are leading the way in delivering an effective network of electric vehicle charging points across the capital.” He added that boroughs also had “a duty to consider the needs of pedestrians and other road users and to make sure these services are delivered to high standards”. Southwark council did not deny that 130 chargers were in limbo, but said it had 100-150 lamp-post electric car charging points planned for the next 12 months."
"Australia’s relationship with the Pacific region on the issue of climate change has been described as “dysfunctional” and “abusive” – providing aid to the region to deal with the effects of global warming but undermining attempts to halt its progress, according to a climate change representative for the Pacific nation of Palau. Xavier Matsutaro, the national climate change coordinator for Palau, a small nation in the north-west Pacific, said Australia’s relationship with the Pacific was “dysfunctional”, adding that Australia was also responsible for diluting the strength of previous regional declarations on climate change.  “Australia is a bit of an anomaly, because on the floor [of climate summits] they’re basically sometimes as far right as Trump in some of their views on climate change, at one point they even denied that it existed … But then on a regional basis they’ve actually given a lot of support to our region,” said Matsutaro. “Sometimes the way I think about it ... it’s like you’re in a relationship and you get abused by your spouse but at the same time they feed you and clothe you and things like that,” he said. “You could say it’s a bit of a dysfunctional relationship.” Matsutaro spoke to the Guardian in Palau a week before leaders, including Palau’s minister of state Faustina Rehuher-Marugg, met in Nauru at the Pacific Islands Forum, where climate change was a key issue discussed by the group.  Leaders are set to sign a new security agreement that labels climate change as the “greatest threat” to the Pacific region. Citizens of the region have been among the first to feel the effects of climate change, with rising sea levels and increased natural disasters in the region. The summit comes at an awkward time for Australia, as the new prime minister, Scott Morrison, faces pressure from some members of his party to abandon Australia’s commitment to reducing emissions under the Paris agreement. Matsutaro said Australia, which has historically been the key aid partner for the Pacific region, had supported projects in Palau related to climate change, including a coastal erosion project and research on coral bleaching. Australia even provided research on the impact of climate change on Palau which formed the basis for a section of Palau’s climate change policy. But when it came time to make commitments on climate change, Matsutaro, who has attended COP meetings on Palau’s behalf for the last five years, said Australia was regularly out of sync with the rest of the region, and was responsible for diluting the strength of resolutions on the environment. “They’re responsible for making our declarations weaker sometimes in the region. So there’s been forums that were formulated so [Australia] won’t be involved in it, they’re not members, so that whatever language that really reflects our views and our circumstances is actually reflected in the declaration,” he said. Pacific leaders have called for Australia to do more to reduce emissions and act to curb the effects of climate change. Last week in a blistering speech in Sydney, the Samoan prime minister called climate change an “existential threat ... for all our Pacific family” and said that any world leader who denied climate change’s existence should be taken to a mental hospital. The prime minister of Fiji, Frank Bainimarama, who has opted to travel to Bangkok for an extra session of the COP23 climate change negotiations instead of attending the Pacific Islands Forum, excoriated global leaders for their inaction on climate change, saying leaders had promised much but delivered little. “If all the noble intentions of all the good people who have built this process since 1992 could be converted to clean energy, we could resolve the crisis now. But intentions are not actions.” He said history would condemn leaders who failed to properly address the impacts of climate change. “Would any of us like to return to our people and tell them that we had the chance to do something truly great and truly necessary for the world we will pass to our children, but we lacked the will to get it done?”"
"Why bother to learn anything in school if politicians won’t pay attention to the facts? This simple realisation prompted Greta Thunberg, 15, to protest in the most effective way she knew. She is on strike, refusing to go to school until Sweden’s general election on 9 September to draw attention to the climate crisis.  Her protest has captured the imagination of a country that has been struck by heatwaves and wildfires in its hottest summer since records began 262 years ago. Every day for two weeks, Thunberg has been sitting quietly on the cobblestones outside parliament in central Stockholm, handing out leaflets that declare: “I am doing this because you adults are shitting on my future.” Thunberg herself is a diminutive girl with pigtails and a fleeting smile – not the stereotypical leader of a climate revolution. “I am doing this because nobody else is doing anything. It is my moral responsibility to do what I can,” she says. “I want the politicians to prioritise the climate question, focus on the climate and treat it like a crisis.” When people tell her she should be at school, she points to the textbooks in her satchel. “I have my books here,” she says in flawless English. “But also I am thinking: what am I missing? What am I going to learn in school? Facts don’t matter any more, politicians aren’t listening to the scientists, so why should I learn?” Thunberg’s protest might come as a surprise to anyone seduced by Sweden’s reputation as a climate pioneer and champion of the environment. This year the country enacted “the most ambitious climate law in the world”, aiming to become carbon neutral by 2045 and comfortably beating the 2015 Paris climate targets along the way. “This is too little too late, it needs to come much faster,” Thunberg says. “Sweden is not a green paradise, it has one of the biggest carbon footprints.” Her parents want her to give up her protest and go back to school. “My teachers are divided,” Thunberg says. “As people they think what I am doing is good, but as teachers they say I should stop.” One teacher to have downed tools to join her protest is Benjamin Wagner, 26. He expects to lose three weeks’ wages – and his job – as a result of his strike. “Our inability to stop climate change is like the efforts to stop world war one – we knew for years it was coming, they arranged all sorts of conferences, but still they didn’t prevent it,” Wagner says. “Greta is a troublemaker, she is not listening to adults. But we are heading full speed for a catastrophe, and in this situation the only reasonable thing is to be unreasonable.” There are signs that more Swedes are listening. The Green party, a partner in the centre-left coalition government, was languishing in the polls before the country was hit by more than 60 forest fires, which raged for weeks through a rural tinderbox created by the unprecedented drought. Now the party’s support is up by half to about 6%. “I am very impressed by Greta’s courage and determination,” says Janine Alm Ericson, a Green member of parliament. “But I am also sad that she feels she has to be there – the political parties in Sweden have not done enough. Thanks to the hot summer it has become easier for people to imagine what climate change can mean for us and others in Europe if we continue to ignore what is happening.” Outside parliament, Stella d’Ailly, 45, an art director, has come to join Thunberg’s protest. “I feel like I am dying inside if I don’t protest,” she says. “Sweden may be well organised to recycle our trash, for example, but we do nothing to cut the amount of plastic bottles and packaging in the first place. We need drastic change.” Thunberg’s own awakening to the climate crisis a few years ago caused upheaval in her family. Her mother, the well known opera singer Malena Ernman, has given up her international career because of the climate effects of aviation. “Greta forced us to change our lives,” says her father Svante. “I didn’t have a clue about the climate. We started looking into it, reading all the books – she has read them too.” Her teachers were telling her to turn off the lights and save paper, then flying off to New York for a holiday. For Greta, this was just not good enough: “Everyone believes that we can solve the crisis without effort, without sacrifice,” she wrote in an article widely circulated on social media and translated into English. While on strike, she has done a lot of homework and read three books, her father says. “She is supposed to be in school, we cannot support her action. But we respect that she wants to make a stand. She can either sit at home and be really unhappy, or protest and be happy.” Greta has Asperger’s syndrome, which in the past has affected her health, he says. She sees her condition not as a disability but as a gift which has helped open her eyes to the climate crisis. “The best thing about my protest has been to see how more and more people have been coming and getting involved,” Greta says. “I don’t care if I get into trouble at school. I believe that one person can make a difference.”"
"From time to time the BBC gets itself into an awful mess over climate change. Unnecessarily so, given that it has visited and revisited principles of good coverage, repeatedly arriving at more or less the same conclusions. Back in 2007, a report for the BBC Trust, then the corporation’s regulator, concluded that the old bipolar world of “the climate change debate” had gone. The working model had to change, as the title put it, From Seesaw to Wagon Wheel : “the weight of evidence no longer justifies equal space being given to the opponents of the consensus. But these dissenters (or even sceptics) will still be heard, as they should.” Four years later, the Trust’s review of accuracy and impartiality in science coverage , commissioned from geneticist Professor Steve Jones, reached very similar conclusions.  Both reports were accepted by BBC managers. Both contain much that is common sense. And then there are the editorial guidelines, which are very clear that the guiding principle is “due impartiality”, rather than equal weight. So how have we reached a situation in which the BBC has to apologise  for not challenging incorrect statements made by Lord Lawson on the Today programme, where an entire Radio 4 feature, What’s the Point of the Met Office?, turns into a polemic about “dodgy” climate science, and where Radio Cambridgeshire finds it appropriate to stage a traditional seesaw-style debate between “warmist” and “sceptic”? One answer is that the BBC has failed to promulgate its “big thinking” on editorial matters to producers and presenters, very few of whom have a science background. After the Jones Review it set up seminars on science coverage; but it failed to make them mandatory, and scrapped them after a year. Staff come and staff go; it seems extremely unlikely that Sarah Sands, editor of Today, had read either the Jones Review or From Seesaw to Wagon Wheel when she decided to call Nigel Lawson for “that” interview. I recently argued for the seminars’ reinstatement and for making them mandatory. Not that I’m claiming credit, but as the CarbonBrief website has reported, the BBC has now done something similar – setting up a new one-hour course on reporting climate change “… covering the latest science, policy, research, and misconceptions to challenge, giving you confidence to cover the topic accurately and knowledgeably”. The basic briefing document for the course is short, but it’s a good start. “Climate change is happening”; there is a range of possible temperature rises for any given level of carbon emissions; one cold winter does not challenge the overall picture; and so on. Unchallengeable, really. If the courses are implemented well, they should improve matters still further. I say “still further” because the lapses to which I referred earlier are conspicuous by their rarity. There’s been a lot of climate change coverage this summer, and the vast majority that I’ve seen has been exemplary. But if this initiative can, for example, make sure that Today presenters know that individual extreme weather events are now routinely being linked to climate change, as Nick Robinson appeared not to know when talking about the heatwave recently, that will be a step forward. Climate science, though, is just part of the picture. The corporation’s coverage of energy could do with an infusion of new thinking on issues linked to climate change. Mercifully the stream of claims that “the lights will go out” as Britain adopts more and more renewable energy appears to have stopped. But which of the BBC’s correspondents knows that energy bills have gone down over the past decade? Not those who last year covered the government-commissioned Helm Review of energy prices, which led to Radio 4 claiming that “bills have doubled over the past decade”. Where is coverage, also, of the existential risk posed to oil companies – and therefore our pension funds – by the tumbling prices of renewable energy and electric cars? This is now standard fare for the FT, Economist, Telegraph, Reuters, Bloomberg … But the BBC has yet to catch on that a transformation of the entire global energy system is a big story. The other major factor behind the BBC’s occasional troubles on climate change is lobbying. The newspaper commentariat is amply stocked with columnists who routinely lambast the corporation for bias; and the weight of rhetoric has had an impact. This, I think, is the real takeaway from the CarbonBrief news: the BBC has decided that it no longer cares about groundless criticism. I assume that the first fulmination against this new course will be in print this weekend or early next week, doubtless full of words such as “indoctrination”. The BBC will be accused of “stifling debate”, even though the course material is clear that it is not. Probably the identity of the “shadowy” figures behind this initiative will be sought. The reality is, though, that climate and energy contrarians are exerting less and less influence on media or politics. As the BBC’s online briefing notes, the government is now taking advice on whether to set a net-zero emissions target in law, not debating whether climate change matters. If BBC bosses have decided that from now on they are going to free output from the occasional grip of the UK’s climate contrarian elite and stand up for evidence – good on them. • Richard Black is director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, and a former BBC science and environment correspondent"
"No one knew Nicolas Hulot, the French environment minister, was about to resign when he went on a radio breakfast show yesterday morning – not even himself. But as the live discussion unfolded, focusing on his government’s failures on climate change, it became clear that Hulot had reached a decision. “I can’t lie to myself any more,” he said. “I don’t want my presence in the government to give the illusion that we’re facing up to such stakes,” he said on public radio France Inter. Explaining how he had felt “alone” in a cabinet that only took insufficient, “tiny steps” to tackle environmental challenges, he announced that he would resign. In a moment of striking self-awareness, Hulot, a celebrity environmentalist, continued: “Have we started to reduce our CO2 emissions? No. Have we started to reduce our use of pesticides? No. To prevent the erosion of our biodiversity? No.” Neither the president, Emmanuel Macron, nor the hprime minister, Édouard Philippe, had been made aware of Hulot’s decision before it happened. The French government was taken entirely by surprise: Marlène Schiappa, Macron’s secretary of state for equality, was being interviewed on another radio station when she heard the news, and asked the presenter if he was joking. Hulot had been one of Macron’s most popular ministers, even after he was accused of sexual assault last February, which he denied. For the French president, it is a heavy blow. On a state visit to Denmark, Macron said he respected Hulot’s “personal decision”, and hoped to still be able to “count on his free and confident engagement” in the future. Yet the surprise resignation complicates things further for the government, who after the mess of this summer’s Benalla scandal was already preparing for a challenging autumn with a much-condemned pensions reform on the agenda. It was only a year ago that Macron rebuked the US president, Donald Trump, for pulling out of the Paris climate agreement by calling to “make our planet great again” – a slogan he proudly turned into a hashtag to underline his campaign pledge to fully address the impacts of climate change. As his ratings keep falling – dropping to 39%, the lowest of his presidency so far – the former poster boy for global environmental action has now lost his cabinet’s signature green advocate. And Macron has got only himself to blame: according to Hulot, what drove him over the edge was the presence of a hunting lobbyist at a meeting earlier this week. “It is symptomatic of the presence of lobbyists in circles of power. Who holds the power? Who rules?” Hulot wondered on the radio. (A few months ago, Macron also announced the reintroduction of the traditional presidential hunt). When Hulot asked the president why the lobbyist was there, Macron apparently responded that he “didn’t know how he had got in.” Understandably, Hulot did not appreciate the impudent humour. Political opposition vocally supported his condemnation of lobbyists’ influence. Macron “sucks up” to lobbyists, ecologist Yannick Jadot told Le Monde. For all the debate around Hulot’s resignation, his wake-up call remains unanswered. “I don’t understand that we are witnessing the gestation of a tragedy with indifference,” Hulot said. “The planet is becoming a sauna, our natural resources are draining, biodiversity is vanishing. And we stubbornly try to revive an economic model that is the cause of all this mess.” Macron may still save face – but that will take real political courage by living up to his promises on cutting emissions, pesticides bans and wildlife protection. Sucking up to lobbyists won’t make the planet great again, Manu. • Pauline Bock is a French journalist based in Britain. She writes for the New Statesman"
"The Greens leader Richard Di Natale will promise to work with a new Labor government to get action on climate change back on track. Di Natale makes the pledge in a landmark speech to be delivered on Monday in Melbourne, kicking off a national speaking tour that anticipates the major policy battles of the next federal election. In a copy of the speech, seen by Guardian Australia, Di Natale promises more progressive policy on the environment, increasing Newstart and creating a publicly owned bank and energy company. But while the bulk of the speech distinguishes the Greens’ offering from the two major parties, on climate change Di Natale says he wants to “make it clear – we’ll work with a new government to get climate action back on track”. Let’s not be diverted by allowing race-baiting and hate to be weaponised to turn neighbours against each other The comment suggests the Greens are keen to avoid a repeat of Labor’s last term in government, when its opposition to Kevin Rudd’s emission trading scheme led to the minority Gillard government legislating an interim carbon price only to see it repealed by the Abbott government. With the Morrison government committing to the Paris agreement’s emissions reduction targets but with no mechanism to achieve them, Labor faces a policy test of its own in choosing whether to pursue its 45% renewable energy target through the Turnbull government’s national energy guarantee or through other means. Di Natale says although the Greens will work with Labor on climate “we know that’s not enough” because the major parties “won’t stand up to their corporate donors at the big end of town”. “They’ll let the Adani mine go ahead and destroy the Great Barrier Reef and oil companies contaminate our Great Australian Bight,” he says. Di Natale says the “first priority” is to turf out the Coalition who “don’t deserve to govern”. He says the decision to replace Malcolm Turnbull with Scott Morrison had brought to power “a man who brutally enforced inhumane policies towards asylum seekers and said to grieving families we aren’t going to let you attend the funerals of your dead children”. The Greens leader also targets the new prime minister for bringing a lump of coal into parliament and making drought a priority of his government without acknowledging the link to climate change. Di Natale predicts political discourse at the next election “will be driven by fear and greed”. He warns of “fear in the form of an attack on migrants and multiculturalism, which by any definition has been an outstanding success”. “Let’s not be diverted by allowing race-baiting and hate to be normalised and weaponised to turn neighbours against each other.” The comments echo warnings from outgoing race commissioner Tim Soutphommasane that race politics are back in Australia. Di Natale predicts parties will display “greed in the form of tax bribes that won’t solve the real economic issues Australians face and will leave corporate power untouched”. He warns the Greens’ political opponents will “keep Newstart and Youth Allowance too low and the price of housing too high”.  “And they won’t close those offshore detention camps.” Labor has promised to improve housing affordability through its plans to restrict negative gearing to new homes and reduce the capital gains concessions from 50% to 25%.  But it has only promised to review the level of Newstart, despite the fact the $38.98 a day payment for a single person hasn’t kept up with national living standards for more than a quarter of a century. Bill Shorten has pledged not to change the Coalition’s immigration policies including turnbacks of asylum seeker boats and offshore detention for people seeking asylum. Di Natale reiterates Greens pledges to reform donations, create a federal independent commission against corruption, and a publicly-owned bank and publicly-owned energy company. He also argues that Australia needs to “change the face of our parliament” to reflect diversity with more “people of colour, people with disabilities, single parents, artists, scientists [and] young people”."
"Better management of fisheries and fishing rights around the world could increase profits and leave more fish in the sea as long as measures to meet climate obligations are taken, new research has found. Even if temperatures rise by as much as 4C above pre-industrial levels – in the upper range of current forecasts – the damaging effects on fishing can be reduced through improving how stocks are fished and managed.  Governments are meeting from 4 September in New York for the first round of talks on a new global treaty of the high seas, which would aim to conserve overfished stocks and make access to key fisheries more equitable. Any agreement is likely to take several years to negotiateand longer to come into force, but scientists say there is no time to be lost, given the magnitude of the threat to the world’s marine ecosystems. Climate change is already causing the movement of some species as their traditional habitats grow warmer, and overfishing is wreaking heavy damage on stocks. However, by adapting fisheries management to a warming climate, and instituting better systems such as monitoring of fleets, the global catch can be increased despite these factors, according to the paper published on Wednesday in the journal Science Advances. “This is a positive message amid the doom and gloom,” said Kristin Kleisner, one of the authors of the study and a senior scientist at the US Environmental Defense Fund. “We can control how we manage our fisheries. We will have severe effects [from climate change] but this shows what we can do as humans to control that.” If temperatures were to hit 4C above pre-industrial levels, but good management was put in place, there could still be an increase of 17% of the amount of fish in oceans, compared with a decline of 5% of fish biomass if current practices continue and the world warmed by only 1C. She noted that new technologies, such as monitoring of fishing vessels from satellites and through the internet, could make a big difference in enabling closer management. These techniques can also make fisheries management more responsive to the changing dynamics of ocean ecosystems, so that fishing can be redirected if stocks appear to be declining, for instance. Under 2C of warming, improved management could yield even better returns, resulting in a 16% increase in the catch, amounting to 25bn servings of seafood a year, and nearly a third more fish in the sea than there are today. The finding is crucial because more than 1 billion people globally rely on fish, particularly key species such as tuna and mackerel, as their main source of protein. Governments agreed in 2015 to take action to limit warming to no more than 2C, regarded as the threshold of safety beyond which the effects of climate change are likely to become catastrophic and irreversible. Kleisner said the results of the study showed that governments should take prompt action to bring in modern fisheries management. Global Fishing Watch, an international NGO, has used technological improvements to open up vast amounts of new data on fishing around the world. These include data made public earlier this year on tens of thousands of global vessels, which would have been impossible even five years ago. Sarah Bladen, of Global Fishing Watch, said even newer techniques were being brought to bear, with results that could be “game-changing” for fisheries management and preventing illegal fishing. “Technological innovation is putting us within reach of a ‘real-time’ digital ocean. The open ocean has long been characterised as the wild west: lawless, remote and plagued by a paucity of data. However, our ability to directly detect and track fishing vessel activity globally is undergoing an extraordinary transformation.” She called on the fishing industry to take note: “This really is, or needs to be, a wake-up call: the era of ‘secret’ fishing spots is over. To maintain the social licence to operate, fishing industries worldwide need to step up and accept, indeed embrace, levels of transparency in fishing activities that were unimaginable a decade ago.” Prof Alex Rogers of Oxford University told the Guardian that international action and a global treaty must be brought in as soon as possible, before the current damage turns into a catastrophe. “The situation is very urgent. We need to bring our activities at sea to a sustainable level,” he said. “The status quo cannot be allowed to continue, if we want to preserve ocean health and have fish for tomorrow.” The threats to ocean life include not only climate change, acidification and overfishing, but the pollution, including plastics and agricultural chemicals that we pour into the sea, and our industrial exploitation of the seabed, for instance for oil and gas exploration and mining. These activities have been enabled by new technology, which is not taken into account in current sea governance, which dates back to the 16th century, according to Rogers. The governance of the high seas, which cover most of the oceans beyond national jurisdictions, had failed to keep up with this pace of change, he added: “These new activities can ramp up very quickly, and do tremendous damage in a very short time.”"
"This summer it seemed as if our two cities had changed places. London was hot and dry while New York had days and days of rain. According to leading scientists, the heatwave in Europe over recent months was made twice as likely by climate change resulting from human activity. There is also growing evidence of the link between climate change and the frequency of major floods, as well as the severity of hurricanes.  It’s clear that what we think of now as freak weather in our cities is likely to become the new normal, and that climate change poses a huge threat to the futures of our children, and many generations to come. As mayors, we are not only committed to taking bold action to tackle climate change and to improve the lives of those we represent, but also to showing others the way. That’s why, ahead of the Global Climate Action Summit in California, we are calling on other cities to stand with us to divest their assets from fossil fuel companies. Today we are announcing a new global initiative for cities on divestment and sustainable investment. Working through the C40 Climate Leadership Group, London and New York will co-chair the Cities Divest/Invest forum, a global network for cities that will not only enable us to share tools, knowledge and experiences, but also to advocate for action on divestment and green investment. London and New York are two of the world’s most dynamic, innovative and forward-thinking cities, and we are determined to push ahead with the goals of the Paris agreement – stealing a march on many national governments. We know that tackling climate change requires action across the board – from how we run our transport networks to using cleaner energy and making our buildings more energy-efficient. But we must also use our economic might to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy. We believe that ending institutional investment in companies that extract fossil fuels and contribute directly to climate change can help send a very powerful message that renewables and low-carbon options are the future. If we want to fund the scale of transformation the world needs, we must foster sustainable investment and use the power of institutional investors, such as pension funds. That’s why – in both London and New York – we are taking all possible steps to divest our city pension funds from fossil fuels. Already, less than 2% of the London Pension Fund Authority’s investments of £5.5bn ($7.1bn) are in extractive fossil fuels – this year, the authority has rid itself of a further £700,000 of fossil fuel investments, including stakes in Shell and BP, and has plans in place to divest its remaining investments. In New York, divestment is under way, with the goal of total divestment within five years. This will mean removing some $5bn (£3.8bn) in investment from the industry. Both our cities are also investing in a sustainable future. London recently launched the £500m Mayor’s Energy Efficiency Fund, working with the European Regional Development Fund and private sector investors to help hospitals, museums, offices, libraries, social housing and universities to become greener and more energy efficient. New York City has increased its solar-energy capacity six-fold since 2013 and is investing $2.7bn in energy-efficiency projects that save New Yorkers money and cut emissions. City government now has more than 1,200 electric vehicles and 500 charging stations. Of course, we acknowledge that divestment and accelerating green investment is not always straightforward. The major portfolios held by public entities are typically pension funds, which aren’t generally under the control of mayors. But we can make progress if we work together with a range of partners – including pension funds, local authorities, campaign groups and the private sector. We believe we can demonstrate to the world that divestment is a powerful tool and a prudent use of resources. And that, together, our cities – New York, London and many others around the world – can send a clear message to the fossil fuel industry: change your ways now and join us in tackling climate change. Climate change knows no borders, and taking this kind of action now could help us make a crucial difference to the people we represent and the future of our planet. • Bill de Blasio is mayor of New York City and Sadiq Khan is mayor of London"
"French environment campaigners have warned Emmanuel Macron is doing too little to combat climate change and must radically rethink his environment policy if he is to honour his promise to “make this planet great again”. Renewed criticism of the centrist French president’s approach to green issues came as Macron replaced his former environment minister, the TV personality Nicolas Hulot, who quit last week saying the government was in thrall to powerful lobby groups and taking only “mini-steps” that were insufficient to deal with climate change. Macron replaced Hulot with the parliament speaker, François de Rugy, a former Green party figure who jumped ship to Macron’s party, La République En Marche, last year.  De Rugy was active in environmental politics for 25 years before opposing what he called a shift further left by the French Green party. He is described as a pragmatist and reformist who is loyal to Macron. But environmental groups immediately questioned whether De Rugy would be able to have an effect on the government’s approach to climate change, saying Macron must better defend biodiversity and address environmental threats.  Macron insists he has gone further on green issues than any other French government, but Jean-François Julliard, the director general of Greenpeace France, said it was clear “the environment is not a priority for Emmanuel Macron and [the prime minister] Édouard Philippe who just use it as window dressing without any real will to engage on environmental transition”. He said he feared De Rugy would simply be “his master’s voice” and added: “Macron must at last take measure of the huge responsibility on his shoulders.” Karima Delli, a Green member of the European parliament, said people wanted “a new pact for ecology”. Pascal Canfin, the head of the World Wildlife Fund in France, who was a development minister in the last leftwing government, said a 21st-century shift was needed on clean energy “but the state is still set up as if it’s the 20th – or even 19th – century”.  Although Macron did not make environmental issues a major part of his election manifesto last year, he later attempted to push them to the forefront as a symbol of progressive politics and to counter Donald Trump’s decision to take the US out of the Paris climate accord. Addressing the US Congress in April, Macron told American lawmakers: “There is no Planet B.” The first challenge for De Rugy will be addressing future energy plans for France, a country overwhelmingly dependent on nuclear energy. The government announced in November that France’s long-held goal of bringing its reliance on nuclear energy down to 50% by 2025 was not feasible and was likely to take a decade longer. Taking office, De Rugy said there was an “urgent” need to act on the environment. “I’m here to take action,” he said. In recent weeks, Macron’s approval ratings have dropped to the lowest since he came to power, as he faces slower economic growth, and struggles to shake off the label “president of the rich”. Over the summer, he faced the first major political scandal of his presidency when a senior security aide was filmed violently assaulting a young man and woman at the edge of a Paris demonstration. Also, it was reported on Tuesday that the surprise resignation of the popular sports minister and Olympic medallist, Laura Flessel, was linked to her tax situation. The French investigative website Mediapart reported that tax investigators had recently notified France’s tax infraction commission over suspicions she had under-reported her earnings."
"Scott Morrison is continuing to insist that Australia will meet its Paris climate commitments “in a canter” despite the government having no emissions reduction policies to achieve that result. The prime minister used a radio interview on Wednesday afternoon to declare “the business-as-usual model gets us there in a canter” – which contradicts advice from the Energy Security Board that says business as usual will mean the electricity sector will “fall short of the emissions reduction target of 26% below 2005 levels”.  Even if the the ESB projections are wrong, and the electricity sector managed to reduce emissions by 26% with no policy to drive that result, the Paris target applies across the economy, not just to the electricity sector, and the government’s own data shows emissions in other sectors of the economy are rising. Morrison told 2GB on Wednesday that business as usual “and technology and the amount of renewable technologies that are already in the system and not being subsidised off into the future means these [Paris] targets are hit”. A summary of modelling undertaken by the ESB and released only a month ago said if no policy was put in place in the electricity sector – which is the business-as-usual case the prime minister refers to – emissions would fall initially, then flatten out and rise towards the end of the decade to 2030 as forecast demand increased, then dip again in 2029-30. The ESB said if the national energy guarantee wasn’t implemented, the national electricity market would “fall short of the emissions reduction target of 26% below 2005 levels”. On Wednesday the prime minister initially said that the renewable energy target was driving up power prices “and that’s why we are stripping [subsidies] out of the system”, then said later in the same interview that the biggest driver of higher power prices was gold-plating of the electricity networks. Asked by his host on 2GB what was ultimately more important, complying with Australia’s international climate obligations, or lowering power prices, Morrison said: “Power prices.” He counselled against being “distracted by ideological debate”. The ESB has warned that if governments fail to implement the national energy guarantee – the policy Malcolm Turnbull shelved to try and stave off the civil war that ultimately cost him the prime ministership – that will “prolong the current investment uncertainty, and deny customers more affordable energy”. The Neg appears dead, but the government signalled it was interested in trying to implement one component of the policy, the reliability obligation, with the states and territories. The commonwealth was due to meet with the states and territories in late September to drive the process forward, but the states have yet to be summoned to a meeting to consider what, if any, progress can be made. The new energy minister, Angus Taylor, is working up a package to take to cabinet for consideration. With internal sensitivities still raw after the implosion of the last parliamentary fortnight, Morrison has been trying to send a signal that the immediate focus is price relief, while resisting calls from conservatives to withdraw from the Paris agreement. In attempt to defuse the push, Morrison has been arguing that meeting the Paris commitments will have no tangible impact on power prices."
"The president of the National Farmers’ Federation, Fiona Simson, has declared that climate change is making drought worse in Australia and says tiptoeing around the subject does not do regional communities any good. “It is the effect of climate change we need to be aware of that makes the impacts of a drought even worse,” she told the National Press Club. “As a community, we want to talk about it and the more discussions we have about and the more open people are in talking about it, then the less uncomfortable it becomes. “But we absolutely have to talk about it and some of the issues that people tiptoe around because they’re worried about offending people or having a discussion about it, then it doesn’t do us any good as a community.” Simson, a farmer on the Liverpool Plains, described agriculture as a diverse industry and she was highly critical of much of the current media drought coverage of the broken farmer dependent on handouts. “I use those words “managing drought” deliberately because managing the drought is exactly what we are doing,” she said. “Many farmers, including me, take offence to the betrayals of the broken-down, handout dependent farmer profile peddled by many members of the media. That simply is not us.” She was critical of the government for allowing regional communities to cope with drought in the absence of a “comprehensive national framework to deal with drought”. “Successive governments have had a go, but we are still without certainty that a national strategy would actually provide. In fact, agriculture in its entirety is to date without a whole-of-government national strategy for plan at all.” In another significant shift in the NFF, Simson also described Indigenous Australians as Australia’s “first farmers” in both her opening acknowledgement of country and her address. “May I acknowledge Australia’s first farmers, in particular the Ngunnawal people on whose land we meet today,” she said. “I pay my respects to elders past and and acknowledge their historic and continuing role in what is a great story of Australian agriculture.” “Drought is not a new phenomenon for farmers. Since farming first started under the auspices of our First Australians, drought has been a part of the landscape and a regular part of the farm business cycle.” Climate change has been a vexed topic for the farm lobby for the past two decades. In 2007, when then prime minister John Howard and Labor opposition leader Kevin Rudd both agreed on action, the NFF said climate change might be the “greatest threat” confronting farmers and their ability to put food on Australian table and the lobby group backed an emissions trading scheme. After Malcolm Turnbull’s first leadership spill in 2009 over emissions policies which saw Tony Abbott win the Liberal leadership, bipartisanship on climate change ended and the NFF went quiet until Simson took the presidency. In 2017, she recognised that climate change posed a significant challenge for Australian farmers and called for cost-efficient emissions reductions. As parts of Australia slide into their seventh year of drought and media coverage places increasing pressure on politicians, Simson’s address was the NFF’s most forthright message on climate change yet to government. It comes less than two weeks after Coalition’s latest energy policy, the National Energy Guarantee, preceded the leadership coup against Malcolm Turnbull. Simson said while every drought was different, this season was the worst on her farm since 1965 and had “taken many experienced and savvy farmers by surprise”. “We are at the front line of climate change, increasingly erratic seasons, out-of-season rainfall or no rainfall at all and longer, hotter summers.” But Simson also pushed back against the suggestion that reducing emissions required culling huge livestock numbers – a suggestion covered in major newspapers that she described as “totally histrionic”. “I’m sure there are those out there reading that thinking it’s true when you have the peak red meat body (Meat and Livestock Australia) forecasting zero [emissions] by 2030 and a huge drop between 2005 and 15 on current modelling, so I think for me it is about having a conversation as a community,” she said"
"The funds committed to fossil fuel divestment now total more than $6tn (£4.6tn), with almost 1,000 institutional investors having made the pledge, according to a new report. The sell-off of coal, oil and gas investments is led by the insurance industry, with $3tn of funds. But it also now includes the first nation to divest, Ireland, major cities including New York and key medical organisations. Major oil companies such as Shell have this year cited divestment as a material risk to its business.  Fossil fuel divestment began on US university campuses in 2011 but now spans 37 nations around the world. Supporters of divestment say existing fossil fuel resources are already far greater than can be burned without causing catastrophic climate change and that exploring for and producing more fossil fuels is therefore morally wrong. They also say fossil fuel companies are risky investments as global action on emissions gets tougher. Some investors argue that remaining as shareholders and persuading fossil fuel companies to change can be more effective. However, another new report finds this approach has not delivered any significant change to date. The new divestment report, by Arabella Advisors, calculates that investors with $6.2tn in assets under management have committed to divest from fossil fuels, up from $5.2tn in the previous report in 2016. “I commend the divestment movement for its incredible progress,” said Mary Robinson, former UN high commissioner on human rights and former president of Ireland. Bill de Blasio, mayor of New York City, and Sadiq Khan, mayor of London, which is in the process of divesting, said in a joint article for the Guardian: “We must use our economic might to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy. Taking this kind of action now could help us make a crucial difference to the people we represent and the future of our planet. Jeremy Grantham, co-founder of GMO, one of the world’s most influential asset management companies, said the financial case for divestment was compelling. “Investors with long-term horizons should avoid oil stocks on investment grounds. They face a sustained headwind. Ethical arguments for divestments are simply not necessary. They are a pure bonus,” he said. Another new report, from Genus Capital Management in Canada, said its fossil free fund had outperformed a benchmark of standard stock market indices by almost 2% per year over the last five years. The company’s Fossil Free CanGlobe Equity Fund is a mix of Canadian and global stocks. “At the five-year mark, we can conclusively say: divesting from fossil fuels pays,” said CEO Wayne Wachell. The Arabella Advisors report noted that the American Medical Association (AMA) and the UK’s Royal College of General Practitioners had both divested. “It is unwise to own fossil fuels companies long-term and the products of these companies are harmful to human health by producing dangerous air pollution and contributing to global climate change,” said Dr Todd Sack at the AMA. Divestment appears to be concerning oil and gas majors. In Shell’s last annual report it states: “It could have a material adverse effect on the price of our securities and our ability to access equity capital markets.” Furthermore, the World Bank Group has committed to stopping funding oil and gas development and major insurers including Swiss Re have decided to stop underwriting coal projects. The report on investor engagement on with fossil fuel companies, from shareholder advocacy group As You Sow, found that 160 climate change shareholder resolutions were filed at 24 US oil and gas companies between 2012 and 2018. However, none of the companies have adopted plans or targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels and most are investing to maintain or expand production. “The oil and gas sector has not stepped up to address the growing risks to their companies, the broader economy, and our planet,” said Andrew Behar, As You Sow CEO. The call for ethical investment was backed by Pope Francis in June 2018, when he addressed the heads of oil companies. He said “disturbing and a cause for real concern” that carbon emissions were still rising and added: “Even more worrying is the continued search for new fossil fuel reserves, whereas the Paris agreement clearly urged keeping most fossil fuels underground.” Ellen Dorsey, at the philanthropic Wallace Global Fund, said the pressure to divest would continue. “Today, our movement pledges to increase divested global assets to $10tn by 2020.” She said investing in clean energy was as important as pulling funds from polluting firms: “Investors should also commit at least 5% of their portfolio to climate solutions to help rapidly scale to 100% renewable energy and universal energy access.” Robinson backed the clean investment call: “This is what climate justice requires.”"
"The major parties are neck and neck in the Sydney seat of Wentworth, and voters in the electorate are concerned that the new prime minister, Scott Morrison, is not as committed to action on climate change as Malcolm Turnbull was, according to a new opinion poll. With Turnbull’s resignation about to trigger a byelection in the Sydney seat the former prime minister holds with a margin of 17.7%, the new ReachTel poll funded by the Australia Institute, with a sample size of 886 residents, suggests voters in Wentworth are focused on Morrison’s early steps on climate and energy. While single-seat polls can be unreliable, the new survey suggests Wentworth voters are in a mood to punish the Liberals after the leadership civil war deposed their popular sitting member, with Labor polling 20%, the Greens 15% and interest in independent candidates in double digits in a poll taken on Monday night. The disaffection evident in the ReachTel poll echoes antagonistic voter sentiment in two reliable national surveys, the Newspoll and the Guardian Essential survey. Both have picked up a significant anti-Coalition swing in the wake of the leadership debacle – a different voter reaction to previous leadership coups, which delivered the government of the day a bounce. Three Liberals have signalled interest in running in Wentworth: the former Business Council of Australia executive director Andrew Bragg, who quit his job on Tuesday night; a former Australian ambassador to Israel, Dave Sharma; and the City of Sydney councillor Christine Forster. The ReachTel poll suggests Sharma is polling 34.6%. Undecided voters are almost as inclined to vote for an independent in the looming contest as for a Liberal candidate. The poll found that 36.5% of undecided voters leaned towards supporting a Liberal, while 32.7% said an independent. While Morrison is under internal pressure from some quarters in the government to dump the national energy guarantee, withdraw from the Paris agreement and pursue coal-friendly policies, the ReachTel poll suggests this would be a risky position to adopt if the Liberal party wants to hold urban seats like Wentworth. A majority in the sample, 66.6%, believes the Neg should include an emissions reduction target, which remains a major flashpoint within the Coalition. Almost 60% of the sample thought the Paris target of a 26% to 28% reduction in emissions should be increased. A larger group, 68.6%, said Morrison would do less to tackle climate change than the prime minister he replaced. Only 10% thought he would do more. Just over half the sample, 50.9%, said they would be less likely to vote Liberal after Morrison brought a lump of coal into question time in February 2017. The risks of Morrison abandoning climate action extend beyond Wentworth. One of the lower house crossbenchers, Rebekha Sharkie, told Guardian Australia that if the new prime minister “decides to go down the pathway of an energy policy without an emissions reduction component, that is all but withdrawing us from Paris – and that would not sit well with my community at all”. If the voter backlash ends up costing the Liberals Wentworth, Morrison will lose his one-seat majority in the House of Representatives, which will make the disposition of crossbenchers critically important. Sharkie said she had spoken to Morrison on Saturday and he had pledged to stand by the government’s commitments to Mayo, made during the byelection when she defeated the Liberal Georgina Downer. She has reserved her position on confidence and supply, and lists the fate of the company tax cuts and the emissions reduction component of the Neg as issues of concern. Senior figures have pushed back against abandoning the Paris treaty, and Morrison has appointed moderates to the portfolios of foreign affairs and trade. The retiring foreign minister Julie Bishop told reporters that Australia needed to stay the course: “When we sign a treaty, partners should be able to rely upon us.” She said: “I was part of the party room of August 2015 that unanimously endorsed the targets for the Paris agreement. I believe that Australia has a very high standing as a nation that keeps its commitments, and is part of the overall global effort for better outcomes for the world.” The resources minister, Matt Canavan – who is pro-coal – said a withdrawal from Paris would hurt Australia’s international reputation. Morrison’s new ministry was sworn in on Tuesday, and the prime minister’s immediate priorities are drought relief, settling the long-running schools funding row and dealing with high power prices. The Neg is officially on ice. The new prime minister’s decision to split the energy and environment portfolios during his weekend reshuffle suggests it will remain there. The prime minister said after the swearing-in ceremony on Wednesday that the immediate priority was power price reductions. He was noncommittal on the fate of the Neg. “There will be continuity in our policy in this area, but there will also be new ideas in this area, to ensure that we get those prices down.”"
"Rising global temperatures mean pests will devour far more of the world’s crops, according to the first global analysis of the subject, even if climate change is restricted to the international target of 2C. Increasing heat boosts both the number and appetite of insects, and researchers project they will destroy almost 50% more wheat than they do today with a 2C rise, and 30% more maize. Rice, the third key staple, is less affected as it is grown in the tropics, which are already near the optimal temperature for insects – although bugs will still eat 20% more. Rising heat stress on crops is already expected to cut cereal yields by about 10% for 2C of warming, but the new research indicates rising pest damage will cause at least another 4-8% to be lost. With 800 million people chronically hungry today and the global population rising towards 10bn, increasing pest destruction will worsen food security. “For many, many people in the world there is already a shortage of food, so it is not like we can afford to spare [more],” said Prof Curtis Deutsch at the University of Washington, US, who led the work. “A lot of people in the world, the most vulnerable, can’t afford to give up anything.” The UK is the worst affected of significant wheat producers, with pest losses expected to more than double from 5% to 11%, and Canada will suffer the biggest increase in maize losses, from 6% to 10%. The world’s biggest growers will also see a major impact, with China’s wheat losses rising 50% and and US corn losses going up by a third. The losses are likely to be underestimates as the scientists did not consider factors such as increased transmission of crop diseases carried by insects, or losses after harvest when the grain is stored. The research also did not assess the risk of population explosions of insects that can wipe out crops, due to the complexity of such events. Action by farmers to try to avoid new pest losses is unlikely to be successful, said Prof Rosamond Naylor at Stanford University, US, and one of the research team. “Increased pesticide applications, the use of [resistant] genetically modified crops and practices such as crop rotations will help control losses from insects. But it still appears that under virtually all climate change scenarios, pest populations will be the winners.” The research, published in the journal Science, started with well-established knowledge about how rising temperature affects insects. “Warmer temperatures increase insect metabolic rates exponentially [and] increase the reproductive rates,” said Deutsch. “You have more insects, and they’re eating more.” The team then added data on today’s pest losses and used a range of climate change models to estimate future losses – all showed significant damage. Overall, losses were found to increase by 20-50% for 2C of warming above pre-industrial levels and 40%-100% for 4C. The latter will be reached this century if carbon emissions are not cut soon. “The overall picture is, if you’re growing a lot of food in a temperate region, you’re going to be hit hardest,” said Scott Merrill at the University of Vermont, another member of the team. Europe’s breadbasket is among the hardest hit, with 11 nations predicted to see a rise in pest losses of 75% or more. “France will get a double whammy,” said Merrill, as it is a top five producer of both wheat and maize. Another big wheat producer, Russia, will see losses rise from 10% to 16% with 2C of warming. Across the globe, an extra 200m tonnes of grain are expected to be eaten by insects in a 2C warmer world. The research was deliberately conservative and so did not allow population explosions of pests to take place in the computer simulations, as it’s difficult to model how these develop, but such explosions cannot be ruled out. Deutsch noted that warmer winters have led the pine bark beetle to kill off forests across North America: “They just come out gangbusters in the spring. You can see the damage to space.” “It is an example of what can happen when you have huge tracts of land that are essentially single crops species with one major pest,” he said. “That is similar in many respects to what agriculture has produced – miles and miles of a single plant.” He also said insect population explosions are seen in fossils from warming periods in the Earth’s past. Markus Riegler, at Western Sydney University in Australia and not part of the research team, said the new work was the first global analysis. “The results show that insects will cause significantly increased grain loss across many regions of a warmer world,” he said. The work used data on 38 insect species but Riegler said the results should be verified for more pests in future. “The substantial increases in pest damage forecast call for action on climate change [emissions] and adaptation,” he said. “Everyone must be involved in change: farmers, industries, policymakers and wider society.”"

"Drivers in Europe have paid €150bn more on fuel than they would have if their vehicles had performed as well on-the-road as in official laboratory-based tests, according to a new report. Car companies have legally gamed official tests of fuel economy for many years by, for example, using very hard tyres during tests or taking out equipment to make cars lighter. The gap between test and actual performance has soared from 9% in 2000 to 42% today.  Analysts at research and campaign group Transport & Environment have now calculated that this difference cost motorists in Europe €150bn (£136bn) in extra fuel between 2000 and 2017. UK drivers paid €3.5bn more in 2017 alone, and a total of €24bn since 2000. A new more realistic lab test is now in place but the European commission uncovered new evidence in July that this was also being gamed by carmakers. This means the increases in fuel efficiency being demanded by the EU as part of its action on climate change are still being undermined and drivers will continue to use more fuel than policymakers intend. Greg Archer, at Transport & Environment, said carmakers’ claims of big improvements in fuel consumption are illusory: “Despite regulations to reduce emissions, there has been no real-world improvement in CO2 emissions for five years and just a 10% improvement since 2000 – far less than the industry like to claim. The victims are citizens that have paid out €150bn for more fuel and are also suffering the consequences of unchecked climate change.” A spokeswoman for the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) said: “It is a matter of fact that technological improvements to new cars have resulted in major CO2 reductions in the past decades, leading to important savings for consumers.” Until recently, all cars underwent a lab-based fuel efficiency test called NEDC. But legal loopholes allowed manufacturers to produce much lower emissions in the tests than on the road, thereby undermining an EU drive towards lower carbon emissions and more economical motoring. Some discrepancy between a standardised test and real world driving is expected, so the Transport & Environment calculations used the 9% gap in 2000 as a starting point. It then worked out how much less fuel drivers in Europe would have needed if that gap had remained constant, rather than rising to 42%. As well as costing motorists more, the gap means CO2 emissions from cars were 47m tonnes more than intended by the regulations in 2017 alone. A new more rigorous test, called WLTP, applies to all new cars sold from September 2018 and it is far more reflective of real world driving, being longer and involving faster accelerations. It also eliminates some of the test loopholes. However, the European commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC) found evidence that car makers were still gaming the new test, although in an unexpected way – to report higher emissions. The rationale for this is that the new WLTP will be used as a baseline for the 15% CO2 reductions proposed by the commission for cars by 2025. Tactics used were starting tests with a depleted battery, meaning more fuel was used to charge it up, and switching up gears more slowly, so the engine speed was faster for longer. These inflated the results by 4.5% on average and up to 13% for some vehicles, the JRC said. Transport & Environment said the gaming could mean carmakers have to deliver just half the emissions reductions intended. “ACEA fully agrees that CO2 values should not be artificially increased on purpose in any way that would undermine the post-2020 CO2 targets,” the spokeswoman said, adding that the issue “is not an industry-wide problem”. All companies should ensure future CO2 reductions are not delivered by optimisation of the testing procedure, she said. A separate report from the UK’s RAC Foundation has found that tens of thousands of popular cars will be unable to use a new fuel that may be introduced to cut carbon emissions. Regular petrol already contains 5% bioethanol, which is produced from plants, but ministers are proposing to increase that to 10%. However, 634,000 cars would be incompatible with E10 fuel by 2020, according to the analysis. Many are vintage vehicles but some are popular family cars, including 28,000 VW Golfs and 16,000 Nissan Micras. A current government consultation suggests that larger garages offering E10 in future must also offer standard E5 as well."
"In America today, it’s rare to see political leaders respond to a threat with an appropriate evidence-based policy solution. At the national level, more often we see actions that aggravate existing problems or create new ones. California – the country’s most populous and economically powerful state – has been a welcome exception. California has been battered by extreme weather intensified by climate change. From 2012 to 2016 the state was scorched by its worst drought in over a millennium. Weather whiplash struck in 2017, when much of the state broke precipitation records. This combination led to devastating mudslides and created the conditions for the most destructive and costly wildfire season on record in 2017, followed by the state’s largest-ever wildfire in 2018, which broke the previous record (set in 2017) by more than 60%.  All of these impacts have been exacerbated by global warming. The past five years have been California’s five hottest on record. And so, the state’s leaders decided to do something about it. California had already set a renewable portfolio standard in 2002, strengthened by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger’s 2008 executive order requiring that 33% of electricity be generated by renewable sources by 2020. Governor Jerry Brown signed Senate Bill (SB) 350 in 2015, expanding the requirement to 50% renewables by 2030.  Last week, California state lawmakers passed State Senator (and candidate for US Senate) Kevin de León’s SB 100, which amps up the target to 50% renewables by 2026, 60% by 2030, and 100% from “renewable energy resources and zero-carbon resources” by 2045. The more aggressive clean energy targets are justified. Not only does California need to make up some of the climate slack created by the Trump administration, but the state is now ahead of its targets, with 29% of electricity last year generated from renewables and over 50% from zero-carbon sources (including nuclear and hydroelectric power). According to the latest California Climate Change Assessment Report, global warming impacts will continue to batter the state: Kevin de León specifically cited the record-breaking wildfires as a key factor in generating the votes to pass SB 100, which had been under debate for nearly two years.  ""Our state is one big tinderbox,"" says @kdeleon in closing on #SB100. ""Wildfires are not longer seasonal."" @HunterCutting, in case you're still wondering whether #cawildfires affect #SB100 debate. Similarly, with its air badly polluted by smoke from wildfires, the Spokane, Washington City Council approved an ordinance setting a goal to get 100% renewable electricity by 2030. And after being struck by Hurricane Harvey in 2017, an increasing number of Houston-area residents accept human-caused global warming (64%) and are concerned about its impacts (52%). It’s hard to deny the reality and adverse impacts of human-caused climate change when they’re hitting people at home. California has long been a leader in climate solutions. The state is home to nearly half of all electric vehicles in the country (over 350,000), with by far the highest per-capita EV ownership of any state. California uses the least electricity per capita of any state, has a carbon cap and trade system, and a thriving economy. California is also leading the way in fighting the Trump administration’s backwards climate policy rollback. Next week, the state will even host a Global Climate Action Summit.  Unfortunately, a new study found that while local climate action like California’s is important, it’s insufficient to make up for the Trump administration’s inaction. To achieve the needed cuts in carbon pollution, federal policy is needed. That means replacing the current Republican leadership and its platform of climate denial with a Democratic leadership like California’s."
"The former president of the National Farmers’ Federation, Brent Finlay, has accused politicians of “jumping in front of the cameras” while shirking effective policy work on drought and climate change. As Scott Morrison and his special drought envoy, Barnaby Joyce, toured south-west Queensland on Tuesday, Finlay described the former deputy prime minister and agriculture minister as the last in a long line of ministers who had “no real appetite” for national drought policy in a changing climate. “Climate change and connectivity are the two biggest issues facing the bush. Climate change is real and we have to have a national drought policy framed on what we know about climate change – the two are interlinked,” Finlay told Guardian Australia. “Instead of jumping in front of the cameras when a drought is on, we need them to do the grunt work on effective financial measures that allow our farmers to build up cash reserves in the good times to draw upon when the dry comes again.” He also called on governments to start rewarding good farmers who prepare for drought rather than the “less efficient” farmers. Finlay said politics had caused a failure of a national drought policy which should apply some structure to how farmers cope in drought and the nature of government assistance. “I went to Labor and the Coalition in 2013 when nowhere in Australia was in drought,” Finlay said. “The Labor government had dropped the exceptional circumstances funding program and I made the comment, this is gone now, what is the national drought policy? “Labor said they would do a policy before the 2013 election. [Former Coalition agriculture shadow spokesman] John Cobb said there would be something on drought. When Barnaby was appointed, he said it will be in the agriculture white paper. It was not there. Building a national drought policy “always seemed too hard”, he said. The white paper did not include climate change in its terms of reference and the NFF was not consulted on those terms. Finlay would like to see drought treated as a new category in natural disaster arrangements to embed a structural mechanism beyond the politics of the day. Dry spells could then be monitored using data from the CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology and when the outlook turned towards drought, conditional government assistance that rewarded good managers would kick in. “Farmers acknowledge drought is a regular part of agriculture and with climate change we will potentially see more and more and that’s what we need,” he said. “The climate is changing, you can see it in the eyes of farmers who dismissed it as rubbish eight years ago. By recognising climate change, it is empowering resources to support agriculture.” He would like to see a permanent drought commissioner placed in the prime minister’s office to be proactive on policy development and climate monitoring. This would be a significant move, as it would place the commissioner out of the hands of the agriculture minister, who is a National party minister in any Coalition government. “The permanent drought commissioner needs to be in PMO, we need to keep it at arms length from those politicians that feel they are directly effected. If it’s in PMO and hopefully its bipartisan, it elevates the management of the position.” Finlay was president of the National Farmers Federation for three years from 2013, coinciding with the last months of the Gillard-Rudd Labor government and Barnaby Joyce’s first three years as agriculture minister. He was also chair of the NFF’s national drought committee. Finlay said the government should put all ideas on the table to change the thinking on drought policy towards a model that rewarded good farm managers. “It’s not going to make me popular to say it but unfortunately current drought assistance measures reward our less efficient farming operators at the expense of those families who’ve been better prepared for drought. “You’ve only got to look at our current weather patterns to know that climate change is real and we should expect more extreme weather including more droughts in the future.” Guardian Australia has contacted Barnaby Joyce’s office for comment."
"Climate change is putting one of the world’s oldest beer varieties at risk, environmental scientists and one of Belgium’s leading artisan brewers have said. A study into temperatures in Brussels and the Pajottenland region south-west of the Belgian capital has raised doubts over the future of the sour lambic beer produced exclusively in the region.  Lambic is fermented in the open air through exposure to wild yeasts and airborne native bacteria. It relies on night-time temperatures of between -8C and 8C (18F-46F) for cooling and inoculation. The traditional brewing season runs from October to April, with bezomerd – Brussels dialect for a beer that has had “too much summer” – a possibility if it is produced any later. After cooling, the lambic is placed in wooden barrels where it is exposed to microbes living on the wood. The perfect temperature for ageing lambic is below 25C, above which the risk of unwelcome bacteria spoiling the beer rises. A joint project between the climate scientists Mark and Asa Stone, Adam Harbaugh from the beer research site Lambic.info and the Brussels brewery Cantillon found this limited brewing window has shortened from 165 days in the early 1900s to about 140, as temperatures have pushed it later into the autumn and brought the season prematurely to an end in early spring. It is feared the number of brewing days will shrink further, bringing the risk of a similar disaster to 2015, when beer had to be thrown away due to excessive temperatures. Dr Mark Stone, a director at the University of New Mexico’s Resilience Institute, said: “The impacts of climate change are often gradual until a tipping point is crossed. Our results show that Cantillon is experiencing shifting brewing conditions, and that adaptation to avoid crossing a threshold will require changes in brewing operations that are outside of their traditional methods. “The threat of climate change on traditional lambic production at Cantillon is indicative of the broader issue. That is, the impacts are not fully recognised until a threshold has been crossed, and adaptation strategies often exacerbate the problem while delaying the inevitable.” Cantillon, which produces 400,000 bottles of the sour beer a year, has warned its ability to produce the beer could be under threat in the long term. Jean Van Roy, Cantillon’s owner, told the Brussels Beer City blog that he believed if he artificially cooled the wort – a liquid extracted during the mashing process – it would change the taste of the beer. “If tomorrow I would have this problem every season, financially it could be a bit difficult, so we would have to change something,” he said. “[But] I would hate to do that … Or we move the brewery to go up north to begin to brew in Denmark, in Sweden, I don’t know.”"
"Sir James Dyson, the billionaire inventor and Brexit backer, has unveiled expansion plans to accommodate more than 2,000 workers at his Wiltshire research facility, more than doubling capacity for electric-vehicle testing. Coming despite severe warnings over lost jobs and investment from no-deal Brexit, his technology company is spending about £200m to expand the testing facility on a former second world war airfield at Hullavington, near Malmesbury in the west of England. The investment comes a year after Dyson announced plans to create an electric vehicle to propel his high-tech household goods company to become a rival to Tesla, the carmaker started by the US billionaire Elon Musk. The British engineering company is developing a car that is due to be ready for road testing in 2020, with the first deliveries coming a year later. Dyson’s expansion plans for the research and development site, which is already home to about 400 workers, include planning applications for more than 10 miles of vehicle-testing tracks with high speed sections, hills and off-road routes to put its new electric cars through their paces. Although only recruiting about 300 more automotive workers at present, planning details show the 45,000-square-metre site will ultimately have space for more than 2,000 people. In addition to the testing track, there will be a cafe, sports centre, recreation space and supporting technical facilities. Dyson has yet to make a decision on whether it will mass-produce its electric vehicles in Britain once testing is complete. Although it designs and develops products in the UK, supporting high-value jobs, it manufactures them in cheaper locations such as Singapore and elsewhere in the far east. The company employs more than 12,000 people around the world with about 4,800 in the UK, centred around Malmesbury. Alongside its vacuum cleaners, hand dryers and car development, the company is working on battery technologies, high-speed electric motors, vision systems, machine learning and artificial intelligence. Despite difficult trading conditions facing many firms after the Brexit vote amid heightened political uncertainty, Dyson has not changed his view that leaving the EU would be best for the country. Before the referendum he was among the most prominent business supporters of Britain leaving the EU despite fiercely vocal support for remain from many other senior figures in business and industry. “Brexit can supercharge British technology and refocus minds on global trade if only we grab the opportunity with both hands – the government must embrace it and support British businesses,” he told the Guardian. Several major industrial companies and carmakers, including Airbus, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have warned a hard Brexit would trigger a reassessment of jobs and investments in Britain. Economic growth has slowed since the referendum, while households are more than £900 worse off, according to the governor of the Bank of England."
"Ministers are “deliberately weakening” the green watchdog that will hold the government to account after Britain leaves the EU, according to Labour’s shadow Brexit minister. Theresa May pledged last January to create a “world-leading, independent, statutory body” to ensure ministers stick to their commitments – replacing the power of the European commission to take governments to the European court of justice (ECJ) for not fulfilling their obligations. Yet the UK watchdog will not have any powers relating to climate change, an issue of heightened public concern since the summer heatwave that has seen wildfires in the north of England and outbreaks of tropical diseases in parts of Europe. Matthew Pennycook, Labour’s Brexit spokesman, said: “Our EU membership has been key to delivering and enforcing UK emission reductions. In choosing to exclude climate change from the remit of their environmental watchdog, ministers are deliberately weakening the tools we have to hold them to account. The Brexit process cannot be used as a cover to water down the UK’s leadership on climate change.” The public deserves to have a watchdog with teeth that can enforce climate policy and ensure our pledges become reality Greener UK, which represents 13 of the UK’s biggest environmental organisations including Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace, the RSPB and the National Trust , said it is very concerned about the omission of climate policy from the watchdog’s remit. About 55% of the UK’s planned carbon reductions are tied to regulations derived from the EU and would have been enforced by the European commission. The watchdog should cover issues such as protecting harbour porpoises, ensuring that water quality and air quality remain high, and protecting wildlife habitats – issues that the European commission has taken action against the UK government. Environmentalists believe the ECJ has been effective in getting Whitehall to live up to its pledges. According to research by the Institute for Government, between 2003 and 2016 the commission started 753 actions against the British government, of which about 120 related to the environment. Yet ministers were quick to settle matters before they reached the ECJ, which only passed judgments on 63 cases. However, 29 of those cases related to the environment, indicating that ministers would often not take action unless forced to do so. In announcing its plans for the watchdog, the government argued that climate change was already covered by the Climate Change Act 2008, which created the committee on climate change and international treaties. But the CCC, which said recently that the UK would miss its 2025 and 2030 carbon reduction targets, only has powers to advise and report. Its chairman, Lord Deben, told the environment secretary Michael Gove that excluding climate policy from the watchdog’s remit would be “artificial and potentially create problems”. But Gove is not responsible for government policy on climate change. The issue has now been passed over to the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). Shane Tomlinson, director at E3G, part of Greener UK, said: “The government says it wants to be a leader in tackling climate change. However, leadership is not just about the promises you make, but being accountable for delivering on them. “The UK public deserves to have a watchdog with teeth that can enforce climate policy and ensure that our pledges become reality.” A spokesman for the BEIS said the government was committed to meeting its climate change targets."
"A remarkable run of observations began 60 years ago at a weather station high on a volcano in Hawaii. Charles Keeling began monitoring carbon dioxide in the clean air at 3,400 metres (11,150ft) on Mauna Loa, far away from vegetation and urban pollution. His first measurements in 1958 showed 315 parts per million (ppm) of CO2 in the atmosphere, and what caught him by surprise was that every year after that the levels of CO2 rose relentlessly in an upward curve, thanks to the carbon pollution pumped into the Earth’s atmosphere.  Now the CO2 has reached more than 400ppm, probably the highest for 800,000 years. It sounds a tiny amount of extra CO2, but it is having a huge impact on the climate by trapping more heat on Earth, driving world temperatures upwards. CO2 in the air is now so plentiful that plants are growing fewer leaf pores to absorb the gas than they did centuries ago, and more CO2 is being absorbed into the world’s seas, making them more acidic. Keeling’s curve of rising CO2 levels is a shocking picture of how much the world’s atmosphere has changed in 60 years, with no end in sight. "

"The prime minister of Samoa has called climate change an “existential threat ... for all our Pacific family” and said that any world leader who denied climate change’s existence should be taken to a mental hospital. In a searing speech delivered on Thursday night during a visit to Sydney, Tuilaepa Sailele berated leaders who fail to take climate change seriously, singling out Australia, as well as India, China and the US, which he said were the “three countries that are responsible for all this disaster”.   “Any leader of those countries who believes that there is no climate change I think he ought to be taken to mental confinement, he is utter[ly] stupid and I say the same thing for any leader here who says there is no climate change.” Speaking at the Lowy Institute, just days before the beginning of the Pacific Islands Forum in Nauru, the Samoan prime minister seemed to take a swipe at Australia’s commitment to minimising the impact of climate change, which he called the “single greatest threat to the livelihood, security and wellbeing peoples of the Pacific”. “While climate change may be considered a slow onset threat by some in our region, its adverse impacts are already felt by our Pacific islands peoples and communities,” said Sailele. “Greater ambition is necessary to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees centigrade and Pacific island countries continue to urge faster action by all countries.” Sailele said addressing climate change required “political guts” from leaders. “We all know the problem, we all know the causes, we all know the solutions. All that is left would be some political courage, some political guts to get out and tell the people of your country, ‘Do this, this, this, or there is any certainty of disaster.’” Sailele’s speech comes as leaders of Pacific nations are preparing to meet at the Pacific Islands Forum in Nauru next week, where Australia is expected to face questions about its emissions targets.  Australia’s new prime minister, Scott Morrison, is under pressure from some members of his party to abandon Australia’s commitment to reducing emissions under the Paris agreement. His immediate predecessor, Malcolm Turnbull, was due to attend the forum, but Morrison has announced he is sending his new foreign minister, Marisa Payne, a move the opposition Labor party condemned as “an insult to our neighbours” as well as “a serious strategic mistake”. Saliele’s speech also touched on China’s rising influence in the Pacific, saying the region had become “an increasingly contested space”. “The big powers are doggedly pursuing strategies to widen and extend their reach, inculcating a far-reaching sense of insecurity.”  "
"After a long summer, children are back at school, the festival season is ending and the World Cup is a distant memory. For us, as the newly elected co-leaders of the Green party, we’re about to enter the most exciting period of our political lifetimes. We’re ready to mobilise a fiercer Green resistance than ever before. In council chambers across the country, brave, independent Greens are already leading a political revolt against the status quo. We want to put the Green party on course to become the third party in Britain, building on this year’s local election success, and get a Green on every council in England and Wales.  But politics isn’t confined to council chambers or the halls of Westminster, and we are not afraid to join protesters taking direct action for what is right. We have just lived through the joint hottest summer on record. Despite environment secretary Michael Gove’s claim to have painted the government green, all he has offered are empty promises, while his government wreaks as much destruction as any Tory government, with fracking, airport expansion and new roads gouging out chunks from our countryside. Yet the scale of the climate crisis calls for a system overhaul. That is why we will always stand with those risking arrest to protest against the environmental destruction of fracking or airport expansion. Meanwhile, the Windrush scandal has exposed just how deep runs the cruelty and incompetence of the Home Office. We believe there needs to be root-and-branch reform of an immigration system that is rotten to its very core. We are proud to support activists and campaigners who are putting their bodies on the line in the fight against the inhumanity of indefinite detention and the forced removals of refugees and migrants. Not only are we proud to say migrants and refugees are welcome here, but we will always celebrate the gift of freedom of movement. Then there’s Brexit. After being laughed at, derided and called delusional, it looks increasingly likely that our calls for a People’s Vote could come to fruition. You’d be forgiven for not immediately thinking of the Greens when it comes to Brexit, because the media has maintained a wall of silence when it comes to our longstanding call for a democratic conclusion to this debate. But we’re not just another party opposing the government’s Brexit fantasies – we’re the only party who can be trusted to oppose Brexit and also offer genuinely bold and radical policies to fix the ailments in this country that led to Brexit. With a government in chaos and a Labour party that’s split down the middle, we could well be on the cusp of another political revolution. But while we will always campaign with others to oppose Brexit, we think it’s time to say loudly and clearly that the Green party will never be part of any vapid centrist blob. Nor will we join the multimillionaires trying to start new parties in an attempt to return Britain to the centrism that so utterly failed people earlier this century. We stand firmly and unequivocally against the forces of racism that whipped up a culture war with so little opposition from the political mainstream in the run-up to the referendum. We want to overhaul the world of work so it is fit to face the challenges of our times, from the role of automation to the rise of insecure working in the gig economy. With the autumn budget fast approaching, we think it’s time to take stock and ask again whether the economy is the master or the servant of the British people. Specifically, we think it’s time for politics to shift away from an obsession with economic growth and a culture of work that sees people slaving away at jobs that offer little material or emotional reward. That’s why our party was the first in Britain to propose a four-day working week, and why we are continuing to think of ideas that will give people more free time to live the lives they choose. While governments must of course focus on the scourge of low pay, precarious work and joblessness that too many people face, they must not do so at the cost of refocusing the economy away from a culture that sees people working themselves to the brink. This country is not broken, but our governments have been for many years. We won’t heal our wounds by facing backwards and grasping for an economic and political settlement that has failed for so long. Instead, we must be fresh in our thinking and bold in our actions if we’re to get the country facing a future that people feel hope about, and where they know that every citizen and their wellbeing will be valued. The Green party will be bold, or we will be nothing, and we will always be up for picking a side in the debates that define this country. Our leadership won’t be shackled by the chains of old-school politics, and we’re starting our leadership as we mean to go on, by putting the big questions at the heart of what we do. • Jonathan Bartley and Sîan Berry are co-leaders of the Green party"
"As humans put more and more heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere, the Earth warms. And the warming is causing changes that might surprise us. Not only is the warming causing long-term trends in heat, sea level rise, ice loss, etc.; it’s also making our weather more variable. It’s making otherwise natural cycles of weather more powerful. Perhaps the most important natural fluctuation in the Earth’s climate is the El Niño process. El Niño refers to a short-term period of warm ocean surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific, basically stretching from South America towards Australia. When an El Niño happens, that region is warmer than usual. If the counterpart La Niña occurs, the region is colder than usual. Often times, neither an El Niño or La Niña is present and the waters are a normal temperature. This would be called a “neutral” state.  The ocean waters switch back and forth between El Niño and La Niña every few years. Not regularly, like a pendulum, but there is a pattern of oscillation. And regardless of which part of the cycle we are in (El Niño or La Niña), there are consequences for weather around the world. For instance, during an El Niño, we typically see cooler and wetter weather in the southern United States while it is hotter and drier in South America and Australia. It’s really important to be able to predict El Niño/La Niña cycles in advance. It’s also important to be able to understand how these cycles will change in a warming planet. Fortunately, a study just published in Geophysical Research Letters helps answer that question. The authors include Dr. John Fasullo from the National Center for Atmospheric Research and his colleagues. El Niño cycles have been known for a long time. Their influence around the world has also been known for almost 100 years. It was in the 1920s that the impact of El Niño on places as far away as the Indian Ocean were identified. Having observed the effects of El Niño for a century, scientists had the perspective to understand something might be changing.  For example, in 2009–2010, intense drought and heat waves gripped the Amazon region – far greater than expected based on the moderate El Niño at the time. In addition, from 2010 to 2011, severe drought and heat waves hit the southern USA, coinciding with a La Niña event. Other extreme weather in the US, Australia, Central and Southern America, and Asia stronger than would be expected from El Niño’s historical behavior have raised concerns that our El Niño weather may be becoming “supercharged.” To see if something new was happening, the authors of this paper looked at the relationship between regional climate and the El Niño/La Niña status in climate model simulations of the past and future. They found an intensification of El Niño/La Niña impacts in a warmer climate, especially for land regions in North America and Australia. Changes between El Niño/La Niña in other areas, like South America, were less clear. The intensification of weather was more prevalent over land regions.  So, what does this mean? It means if you live in an area that is affected by an El Niño or La Niña, the effect is likely becoming magnified by climate change. For instance, consider California. There, El Niño brings cool temperatures with rains; La Niña brings heat and dry weather. Future El Niños will make flooding more likely while future La Niñas will bring more drought and intensified wildfire seasons. Unsurprisingly, we’re already seeing these effects, with record wildfires in California fueled by hot and dry weather. We are now emerging from a weak La Niña, so we would expect only a modest increase in heat and dryness in California. But the supercharging of the La Niña connection is likely making things worse. We would have California wildfires without human-caused global warming, but they wouldn’t be this bad. Dr. Fasullo nicely summarized the findings of the paper: We can’t say from this study whether more or fewer El Niños will form in the future — or whether the El Niños that do form will be stronger or weaker in terms of ocean temperatures in the Pacific. But we can say that an El Niño of a given magnitude that forms in the future is likely to have more influence over our weather than if the same El Niño formed 50 years ago. And this conclusion can be extended to many other situations around the planet. Human pollution is making our Earth’s natural weather switch more strongly from one extreme to another. It’s a weather whiplash that will continue to get worse as we add pollution to the atmosphere. Fortunately, every other country on the planet (with the exception of the US leadership) understands that climate change is an important issue and those countries are taking action. It isn’t too late to change our trajectory toward a better future for all of us. But the time is running out. The Earth is giving us a little nudge by showing us, via today’s intense weather, what tomorrow will be like if we don’t take action quickly."
"There is a tacky interface between industry and government when it comes to public health or the environment, and it is abundantly clear that Brexit is fatally shifting the balance towards deregulation (“Green watchdog will lack bite after Brexit”, News). It is no coincidence that the most prominent Brexiters are also climate change deniers because they perceive climate change legislation as a major threat to industrial profit. This is the reason that the Department of Energy and Climate Change was dissolved, the reason that climate change has been omitted from the remit of the government’s new green watchdog, and the reason that Brexiters fulminate against the Climate Change Act.  The ruinous aspect of their delusion is that climate change offers huge opportunities to UK businesses that invest in energy efficiency, clean energy or ultra-low emission transport, as these new technologies can then be exported, something that Brexiters are apparently keen to promote. Instead, the government has scrapped zero-carbon buildings, abandoned the tidal barrage in Swansea Bay and frozen the fuel escalator, thus encouraging the rapid growth of diesel vehicles. The chancellor boasted that this had saved motorists £47bn over the past seven years. Unfortunately, air pollution has cost the NHS £140bn over the same period and 280,000 premature deaths. How tragic that Brexit generates politicians of such limited vision who can only look backwards.Dr Robin Russell-JonesChair, Help Rescue the PlanetMarlow, Bucks In Robin McKie’s article about social drinking (“Why social drinking is an ancient ritual”, Focus), you may be interested to know that the photograph of “drinkers in a hotel bar in 1939” featured my mother, Camille Cowtan (nee Silvera), at the age of 22 years. She is now 101 years old and in good health, residing in a nursing home in Stockport, Greater Manchester. Perhaps this backs up the theory that social drinking can be beneficial.Susan EhrenzweigLondon N12  James Hawes on the far right in Germany reminds me of a guided tour in 1982 in Czechoslovakia (“Germany’s far right never went away, but festered in its eastern stronghold”, Comment). The minibus group was a mix of British and West German tourists. The Czech guide, when we arrived at Lidice, mentioned that her mother had died in Auschwitz. I asked how she felt about dealing with the West Germans. She responded that the West Germans were fine as they had faced up to their past. She feared the East Germans because they had never been “de-Nazified”. Thirty-six years later, reunification hasn’t changed that mindset.Jennifer HenleyLondon W5 Kenan Malik is right to note that some aid is guided less by poverty than by geopolitical and strategic interests (“As a system, foreign aid is a fraud and does nothing for inequality”, Comment). However, the piece doesn’t mention the importance of “quality” in aid. When aid is good quality it makes a real change in the lives of poor and marginalised people. When aid is bad quality, it fails to tackle poverty and work for those it was meant to help. For aid to live up to what’s expected of it – for it to be “real” aid – it must bespent in the areas and on the people most in need. It must prioritise those it is intended for, be properly monitored and offer value for money. And it must be transparent, so spending can be tracked. Almost all UK aid meets this definition. In recent years, UK aid has helped to vaccinate 37.5 million children, and a further 11.4 million children receive a decent education. The public are attuned to this and support aid that is good quality. When a tabloid howls at “wasted aid”, the programme in question is rarely “real” aid addressing poverty. Far from “entrenching inequality”, real UK aid makes a difference to the lives of millions.Romilly GreenhillUK director, the ONE CampaignLondon WC2 I would like to clarify some points about the Press, a newspaper in West Yorkshire that featured in an article last week (“The far-right activist and the editor: how paper is ‘sowing division’ where an MP died”, News). The story appeared to confuse editorial comment with news reporting in respect of opinion columns. Editorial comment is free to be more partisan within certain legal restrictions. I was responsible for newsgathering at the Press from March 2011 to August 2016. The news reporting was factual, impartial and written in a neutral tone. It also had an investigative side, centred on public affairs journalism. Great effort was made to report facts accurately. There was no twisting or spinning to suit an agenda – and any alleged mistakes were certainly not intentional. The responsibilities were taken seriously. Any problems with the factual nature of the reporting were corrected immediately online and then in the next print edition. Issues were also looked at from as many sides as possible. These ranged from trade union officials to environmental campaigners, councillors of all political parties, headteachers and hospital managers among many sources. And, yes, that did mean contacting extremist groups on occasions and recording their views accurately. Also, the newspaper covers not just Batley, where it is based, but other places including Dewsbury, its former home.David MillerBirstall, BatleyWest Yorkshire School authorities, parents and students should be advised that there is an alternative perspective to that peddled by the barbarous defence/war industry (“Who spends millions to push its brand in our schools? The world’s arms industry”, News investigation). The arms trade is an inefficient use of vast resources, manufacturing harmful products. The manufacturer’s balance sheet and the country’s GDP state that it is profitable. Measured in money, the value of adverse production is calculated to be equal to prosperous production: a problem of economics deeming all production to be wealth creation and of positive value, even when contrary to the (international) common good. Arguably, because of the absence of any benefit for the target/human life/civilisation/environment, the manufacturing process is destroying existing wealth and, in so doing, devaluing the money used as the measure. The arms trade is negative value production that adversely affects international currencies as well as life, living standards and the natural world.Geoff NaylorColden CommonWinchester, Hants"
"After a long, hot summer beset by record temperatures, drought and deadly fires, imagine my shock, on returning to the European parliament, to be confronted with a report that denies the reality of climate change. Given it could influence the allocation of the next round of environment funding under the EU’s Life programme, it is deeply disturbing to see such a report, based on wholly discredited science, wending its way down the corridors of Brussels. Some of the claims made by the report’s author, the Ukip MEP Stuart Agnew, are, frankly, pretty hair-raising. For instance, he claims that the effect of CO2 levels on our climate is “negligible”, and that it is “one of agriculture’s greatest friends”. Agnew claims there is a lack of concentration of CO2 and as a result there is no problem for the EU to solve.  So how could it be that someone with a track record of shameful ignorance of the science of climate change ends up being assigned the task of compiling this report? Unbelievably, the decision to appoint Agnew was met with support from Christian Democrat, Conservative and Liberal members of the European parliament’s agriculture committee, while the Socialists and Democrats, supported by the Greens, attempted to challenge the decision to give Agnew the leading role. Quite rightly, in response to this news, climate experts have reacted with disbelief and anger. Bob Ward, from the Grantham Research Institute on climate change and environment at the London School of Economics, said: “There is not a single scientific institution in the world that would agree with this daft assessment. This document demonstrates how Ukip’s climate change denial is putting at risk the lives and livelihoods of people in the UK and across the European Union.” Dave Reay, professor of carbon management at the University of Edinburgh, also ridiculed the report: “The hackneyed, pseudo-scientific arguments here would make the dinosaurs blush. This will be a wonderful resource when [my students] discuss the ill-informed ideas that bounce around the echo chamber of climate change denial.” What this fiasco reveals is the huge threat to rational climate action posed by the rise of the far right. It also shows the risks from Brexit, as the links between climate denial and Brexit are well documented. For example,the long-standing supporter of Brexit and arch-neoliberal Nigel Lawson founded the Global Warming Policy Foundation to oppose climate change mitigation policies. He labelled the Kyoto protocol “wrongheaded”, and has called for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to be shut down. Lawson may be considered an irrelevant dinosaur, though he still manages to platform his nonsense at regular intervals on the BBC. But the man who Conservative MP Anna Soubry declared was now running the country, the hardline Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, has blamed high energy prices on “climate alarmism” and has said it was unrealistic for scientists to project future climate changes, just as it was difficult for meteorologists to correctly predict the weather. Meanwhile, Nigel Farage, adding to a litany of ill-informed comments on climate change, earlier this year declared that the “beast from the east” was proof that global warming wasn’t real. And of course, favouring supposed “alternative facts” on climate change is a prejudice shared by other far-right groups, most notably Donald Trump’s circle. Given the dangers posed by the far right and the very real threat of a significant bloc of populist, climate change-denying MEPs after next year’s European elections, it is time for those of us who back the overwhelming scientific consensus on climate change to take back control. That is why I joined other politicians, scientists, academics and campaigners in signing a letter pledging we would refuse to debate those who deny that human-caused climate change is real. We can no longer give voice to the pseudo-science of climate change deniers; we must urgently move the debate on to how we address the causes and effects of dangerous climate breakdown. The large right and centre-right groups in the European parliament could and should have blocked Ukip from taking charge of a report on climate change. We can only hope that the mainstream groups in parliament – right, left and centre – that are likely to continue to control the majorities will show a greater degree of responsibility in future. • Molly Scott Cato is the Green MEP for the south-west of England"
"Hundreds of thousand of people in more than 90 countries are expected to take part in demonstrations this weekend to protest about the failure of politicians to tackle the global environmental crisis. Organisers say more than 800 events – from marches to street theatre, acts of civil disobedience to mini festivals – will take place in towns and cities amid growing frustration at the lack of meaningful political action over the emerging climate breakdown.  Nick Bryer from campaign group 350.org which is organising the event said: “Politicians are failing. They are still protecting the interests of the fossil fuel companies over the interests of people, despite mounting evidence of the devastation these companies and this system is causing the planet.” He said the day of global demonstrations was about people around the world “rising up and demanding a different cause of action, a different future which puts people and a sustainable future before the interests of these huge corporations”. In the UK there are events organised in cities from London to Wigan, Bradford to Durham. Jane Thewlis, from Fossil Free West Yorkshire, is organising an event in Bradford. “We have a brilliant jazz band the Peace Artistes which are well known round here and the focus is divestment and a celebration of what has already been achieved from New York to Ireland.” Thewlis said the group were campaigning to persuade the five West Yorkshire councils to divest their pension funds from fossil fuels and hoped the event would galvanise support – especially among young people. “There will be several young people speaking, many of them associated with a group called Hope Rising which is based on a local council estate.” Thewlis said the same policies that are damaging the lives of poor people in Bradford were driving the destruction of the planet and killing marginalised people around the world.

We hope that these young people will form their own environmental group following the event and build a sustainable movement.” One of the biggest protests is expected in Paris where up to 100,000 people are expected. Events in other European cities including Copenhagen, Brussels and Lisbon are also expected to attract tens of thousands of protesters. The events come ahead of the Global Climate Action Summit that starts in San Fransisco next week and will see politicians and city leaders from around the world gather to discuss the climate crisis."
