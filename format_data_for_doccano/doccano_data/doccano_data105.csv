"Jeb Bush said on Wednesday that the Earth’s climate is changing but that scientific research does not clearly show how much of the change is due to humans and how much is from natural causes.  Bush delved into climate politics during a campaign-style house party in New Hampshire at which he took questions from voters on his viewpoints as he considers whether to seek the Republican presidential nomination in 2016.   Although the US president, Barack Obama, and most climate scientists say humans are ‘unequivocally’ to blame for climate change, Bush said the degree of human responsibility is uncertain.  “Look, first of all, the climate is changing,” he said. “I don’t think the science is clear what percentage is man-made and what percentage is natural. It’s convoluted. And for the people to say the science is decided on, this is just really arrogant, to be honest with you.  “It’s this intellectual arrogance that now you can’t even have a conversation about it. The climate is changing, and we need to adapt to that reality.”  The former Florida governor’s views on climate change are dramatically at odds with national science academies, and the world’s most authoritative experts on the science, the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The IPCC said in a 2013 landmark report that it was extremely likely, or 95% certain, that more than half of the warming observed between 1951 and 2010 was manmade. A study found that of 4,000-plus papers published in academic journals that took a position on the causes of climate change, 97% said it was a a result of human activity. Bush also challenged Obama’s determination earlier in the day that climate change was a threat to US national security.  “As a small part of US foreign policy,” Bush said, the US should encourage states that have had an increase in carbon emissions to take on the challenge.  But the overall country has had a reduction in carbon emissions due to new technologies, conservation measures, higher gas mileage in vehicles and a shift toward natural gas, he said.  “If the president thinks this is the gravest threat to our national security, it seems like he would say, ‘Let’s expand LNG [liquefied natural gas] as fast as we can to get it into the hands of higher carbon-intense economies like China and other places. Let’s figure out ways to use compressed natural gas for replacing importing diesel fuel, which has a higher carbon footprint,’ ” Bush said.  Although he does not believe climate change is the “highest priority”, the US should not ignore it, he said. "
"The Guardian’s story (Firm tried to exploit Ebola crisis for gain, say health experts, 20 May) on Peabody Energy’s campaign to combat global energy poverty grossly distorted Peabody’s discussion of Africa’s Ebola crisis last fall. In speaking at a conference last fall, Peabody executive chairman Greg Boyce simply echoed the words of the World Health Organisation in noting that lack of electricity is a barrier to combating diseases such as Ebola.  Note to the Guardian: reliable low-cost electricity at large scale, such as that provided by coal, allows a large number of aspects of a society to work better – including providing basics such as healthcare. This isn’t a controversial statement, and it’s stunning that the Guardian and its allies would try to drum up issues where none exist. Given the Guardian’s active campaign to promote fossil fuel divestment, one can only question its ability to report on coal or other fossil fuels without bias and conflict of interest. This tortured attempt to distort the facts demonstrates that the answer is no. We encourage all readers to go to www.AdvancedEnergyforLife.com to discover the global crisis that is energy poverty, the benefits of access to low-cost electricity, and the improving emissions from clean coal technologies.Vic SvecSenior vice-president – global investor and corporate relations, Peabody Energy"
"With global demand for energy continuing to rise and fossil fuel production buoyed by $5.3tn (£3.4tn) in tax-payer subsidies annually, it is easy to lose hope that cleaner forms of energy will ever catch up. But there are beacons around the world showing the way to an energy future that does not run on coal, oil and gas. Here are nine places that are blazing a trail to a less polluting future.  It was only through total disaster that the aptly-named Greensberg, a sleepy, Republican whistle–stop on the Kansas prairie, was able to transform itself into America’s greenest town. After a massive tornado destroyed 95% of the buildings in the town in 2007, the 1,400 residents had to choose if they would rebuild or relocate. A tough choice in a town that had been in decline for decades. About half the townspeople left, but a group of residents established a master plan to rebuild the town as an energy-saving, renewable energy haven. Just outside the town, they built a 12.5MW wind farm. This supplies 300% of the town’s electricity, with the excess pumped into the Kansas grid. But key to this green resurrection has been energy efficiency. Because of the ability to rebuild from scratch, residents were able to apply the most modern building techniques to Greensberg 2.0. The town now has the highest concentration of gold and platinum eco-design rated buildings in the US and all of its street lights are LED. All large government buildings are now rated platinum. This saves the town over $200,000 a year and, more importantly, reduces the town’s dependence on generating electricity. Since winning a Danish government competition for designing a carbon neutral community in 1997, the island of Samsø, off the east coast of the Danish mainland, and its 3,800 residents have pioneered energy independence. The island has been carbon neutral for aabout five years. All of Samsø’s electricity is produced by 21 wind turbines and 70% of its heating is produced from biomass boilers. The wind electricity the island generates more than offsets the fossil fuels burned by the community’s vehicles and ferries, and plans are afoot to shift over to electric vehicles. By making initial investments in the project, “Samsingers” own about 70% of their electricity infrastructure through a cooperative model. Scientific American has called it “an alternative view of the future”. Few places are as thoroughly predisposed to life without fossil fuels as Iceland. This spectacular volcanic land sits at the head of the mid-Atlantic ridge, where the tectonic plates of North America and Eurasia are splitting apart and the Earth’s mantle bubbles towards the surface. The Icelandic people, so long impoverished by their reliance on burning peat and imported coal from Europe to survive, have harnessed this heat to enable an almost total transition from the fossil-powered past. All of Iceland’s electricity comes from renewable sources, three quarters from hydroelectric dams on the glaciers and mountain sides and the rest from geothermal. Bores are drilled 1-2 miles into the thin crust of earth. Water pumped down into the hot rocks returns as high pressure steam, spinning turbines to produce electricity.  The country also uses this heat directly. Two-thirds of the country’s primary energy comes from geothermal. Hot water is everywhere and is tapped to heat homes and offices. The streets of Reykjavik are kept snow and ice free in winter through a system of heated water pipes. None of this, however, has stopped the Icelandic government seeking to exploit the oil and gas reserves of its surrounding seas. In another example of making use of what you’ve got, the 12,000 residents of the Spanish island of El Hierro use their extra wind energy to pump water into the sealed crater of an extinct volcano, 700m above sea level. Then, when the wind drops, the water runs through a hydroelectricity plant ensuring an uninterrupted supply. It’s a huge, unusual and very effective battery. The island is the most remote of the Canary Island chain and once generated power from an expensive diesel generator. They claim to be the first island to have evolved to electricity self-sufficiency without connecting to a grid first – unlike Samsø. “When they turn on the light, they think of the windmills moving and maybe they think, ‘We are different than the rest of the world, because we are catching electricity from these windmills and not from conventional engines,’” the island’s governer Alpidio Armas told NPR last year. If the western world, with its cities built on billions of tonnes of carbon emissions, is to do its fair share to defeat climate change then it must look to the Danish capital as a model for the future. Copenhagen ranks as the greenest city on Earth in the Siemens/Economist Green City Index and was Europe’s Green Capital in 2014. But beyond the rankings, Copenhagen is truly breaking new ground. It is set to be carbon neutral by 2025. This will involve halving its emissions and offsetting its remaining carbon use by producing more renewable energy than it consumes. By focussing on building standards and energy efficiency, the city believes it can make large inroads into its energy consumption. Dolf Gielen, a director at the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena), said cold cities with large heat energy requirements are counterintuitively well placed to shift their heat to renewable sources because they often have large scale centralised heat plants – rather than boilers in every home. By 2025, the city says 75% of all journeys will be by foot, cycle or public transport. Copenhagen is now considering how it can transition away from fossil fuel use altogether by 2050. This will go a long way to helping the Danish government achieve its national goal of independence from fossil fuels in the same time frame. Professor Brian Vad Mathiesen, who authored a report on Copenhagen’s 2050 strategy, said the goal was possible and, most importantly, replicable. “The vision we created for Copenhagen as a city based on 100% renewable energy in 2050 can be seen as a paradigm that many other ambitious cities can copy around the world,” he said. Like many small, isolated islands, Samoa’s need to ship in diesel for electricity generation has led to high power prices and been a boot on the throat of the developing economy. For these islands, says Irena’s Gielen “it makes perfect sense to switch to renewables”. The government has set itself the target of achieving 100% renewable electricity generation by 2017 and is well on course. Last year the UN climate chief Christiana Figures congratulated Samoa on being a leader among small island states as they attempt to bypass the fossil fuel economy. The government and developers have used the island’s rivers, sunlight and wind to generate electricity. Last year, the country’s first wind farm was completed. The two turbines will cut annual fossil fuel expenditure by $475,000. Because of the regular occurrence of tropical storms, the turbines are designed to fold away their blades when necessary, protecting them from destructive winds. Devastated by tsunami in 2011 and still suffering from the radiation spilled by the Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, the prefecture of Fukushima has declared its intention to rebuild itself as a renewable energy haven. As a country, Japan was left deeply scarred by its experience with nuclear disaster. The fallout from Fukushima has been a dramatic rise in carbon emissions as nuclear reactors across the country were switched off and fossil fuels were poured into the breach. By March last year, after years of strong cuts before the disaster, emissions had risen to their second highest level on record. But Fukushima’s government has committed to building enough renewable electricity capacity to supply its 2 million residents by 2040. Driving the transition is a focus on community scale solar and wind plants. By 2020, the prefecture aims to have 143 floating wind turbines with a capacity of 1GW installed. The Orkney islands are home to Europe’s most productive wind turbine. During April, NM92 became the first wind turbine in Europe to click over 100,000,000 kWh – enough electricity to power a typical UK home for over 30,000 years. With it’s total exposure to winds sweeping out of the Northern Atlantic, Orkney – which translates from Icelandic to ‘energy islands’ – has become a beacon for renewable energy consistently producing more renewable electricity than they consume. Advanced testing of wave and tidal generation is also underway. The cheap, clean energy has led to a growing demand for electric vehicles. Currently 50 cars cruise the islands, about 5% of the entire Scottish electric vehicle market. Orkney has just 0.4% of the country’s population. While it’s not a done deal, Tianjin Eco-city provides a clue to how China might answer the question: what are you going to do with all these millions of newly middle-class, high carbon-emitting citizens? The Eco-city is a $24bn model of sustainability. It is being built from scratch and, when complete, will be able to accomodate 350,000 residents. It is just one of hundreds sprouting across China as the urban population, swelled by the rural poor, grows by 13m each year. The city puts a premium on energy efficient buildings – a must for a country where coal smog has cut life expectancy in some areas by 5.5 years. Public transportation and modern urban planning will also help to cut pollution and carbon emissions. But a Guardian visit last year found the Eco-city remained largely empty, an environmentally-friendly Potemkin city of empty highways and just 6,000 people, meaning the project remains an incomplete vision of a healthier, less-polluted China."
"Developing countries are “waiting to see” what rich nations will offer them in global warming talks, the French minister of environment has said, ahead of crunch negotiations to be hosted in Paris later this year. Ségolène Royal, the environment minister and former presidential candidate, will play a leading role in the United Nations conference in December as the French government is working to produce a new “Paris protocol” that would determine the future of global action on climate change for decades beyond 2020.  She told the Guardian in an exclusive interview: “Developing countries are not hostile [to an agreement]; I would say that they are positive, but they are waiting to see. We have to meet their expectations.” She said that the key to a successful agreement would be for rich countries to come forward with plans to provide financial assistance to the poorer world, to help developing nations cut their greenhouse gas emissions, avoid basing their future economic growth on fossil fuels and adapt their infrastructure to the likely ravages of climate change. Royal strongly criticised commodity businesses that she said had “seized resources” without factoring in the cost of the climate change arising from the greenhouse gases they emit. “The financial sector has been extremely predatory on natural resources for a long time,” she said. “They must understand what is at stake. Natural resources have been seized, and the real costs of them have not been paid. We did not give the right price.” She said energy, transport and construction companies would all have to change radically the way they do business, in order to reduce emissions and lead the way to a low-carbon economy. At Paris in December, world governments are expected to sign a new global agreement on climate change, with commitments from both developed and major developing countries on limiting greenhouse gas emissions beyond 2020, when current commitments run out. This is seen as the last chance for the world to craft such an agreement, because scientists have warned that rising emissions will soon push the world over the critical 2degC threshold, beyond which global warming is likely to become catastrophic and irreversible. So far, more than 30 countries, including the EU and the US, have submitted emissions plans to the UN. Developed countries are expected to make absolute cuts in their emissions, by 2025 or 2030, that go much deeper than the cuts to be made by 2020, which were agreed at the landmark Copenhagen climate conference in 2009. Poorer countries are required only to curb the future growth of their emissions. But analysis of the commitments made so far, and likely to made before Paris, show that they are insufficient to meet the targets scientists say are needed to avoid dangerous levels of climate change. Royal said she was pushing countries “to be more ambitious, to come up with more” ahead of the Paris conference. She said there was an urgent need to invest more in renewable energy, electric vehicles and energy efficiency, if climate change goals were to be met. As “an ideal”, she said, the world would “give up fossil fuels”. But “I don’t think we are going to” in the short term at least, she added. She was also adamant that climate change was not merely a question of economics, but “a matter of civilisation”, and that people should be persuaded to see reducing emissions, and the means to do so, such as renewable energy, in a positive light. “We do not want environmental issues to be a matter of punishment,” she said. • This article was corrected on 29 May 2015.

"American politicians who deny that rising seas, thawing permafrost and longer wildfires are the crippling effects of global warming pose a serious threat to US national security, Barack Obama said on Wednesday. The US president issued a forceful call to action to combat climate change, framing global warming as a national security priority, at the commencement ceremony – or graduation – of the United States coast guard academy in New London, Connecticut. They’ll say, ‘You know, I’m not a scientist.' Well, I’m not either In his speech, Obama detailed the ways the US military would be forced to respond to climate change in the future. He called refusing to act “a dereliction of duty” and said it undermined American readiness. “This is not just a problem for countries on the coast or for certain regions of the world,” Obama said. “Climate change constitutes a serious threat to global security, an immediate risk to our national security, and make no mistake: it will impact how our military defends our country. “We need to act, and we need to act now,” he said. He also discussed the risk to global security from climate change and large weather-related disasters that could fuel political instability and tensions. Obama’s speech on climate change comes as he is trying to build support for an international agreement to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Global talks on the deal are slated for Paris in December. “Politicians who say they care about military readiness ought to care about this as well,” Obama said of the climate deniers. Several times Obama lambasted those who refused to endorse the science of climate change.  “They’ll say, ‘You know, I’m not a scientist,’” Obama said. “Well, I’m not either. But the best scientists in the world know that climate change is happening.” He added: “Our analysts in the intelligence community know climate change is happening. Our military leaders – generals and admirals, active duty and retired – know it’s happening. Our homeland security professionals know it is happening. And our coast guard knows it’s happening.”  The Pentagon is assessing the vulnerability to climate change of its 7,000 bases, installations and facilities, many of which are on the coast, the White House has said. Obama is set to highlight damage to the navy and air bases at Norfolk, Virginia, from increasing floods, to Alaskan facilities built on thawing permafrost, and to military training areas in western states from wildfires. This summer, his administration will finalize regulations to cut carbon emissions from power plants, a step that has been fought by Republicans who control Congress. He has also said he will make a decision before he leaves office on the long-stalled Keystone XL crude oil pipeline from Canada, a ruling he has said hinges in part on whether the TransCanada Corp project would boost carbon emissions.

"We’re all hardwired to ignore climate change: the issue is impossibly slippery and open to bias, and political tribalism has been a catastrophe for those trying to tackle it, according to social change activist and leading climate change thinker, George Marshall.  Speaking to Guardian columnist George Monbiot at a Guardian Live event in London this week, Marshall said that while much of the world still denies or ignores the obvious impacts of climate change, there are some simple ways to go about changing public opinion.  Politicisation has been a catastrophe for climate change“We will not win on this issue until we have equal representation and diversity of people demanding action,” he said. “What the election showed us is that half the British population is voting for conservative parties for whatever reason. Are we just going to disregard those people, pretend they don’t exist? Or are we going to reach across to them … and get them on board?” Unlike Naomi Klein, Marshall is wary of framing the debate in terms of left and right; creating a potentially Manichean divide with climate activism on one side and Neoliberalism on the other. “We need to fight against some forms of the economy at the moment, but I’m not persuaded that there was some kind of golden age when we were so cooperative and socially minded,” he said. “It will always be a bad time to deal with climate change – part of the reason for that is that we’re all involved in it.” Marshall believes the climate change movement must overcome political tribalism and find an inclusive narrative to build a collective identity for people, whatever their values. “It’s become part of people’s political identity whether they believe in climate change or not, but I don’t think there’s any fundamental reason why climate change should belong to one political worldview or another,” he said. “This is not an issue where we can have some kind of vanguardist approach – it’s far too big for that.” Governments compartmentalise and obscure the issueSo why do so many governments have policies with the stated intention of cutting greenhouse gas emissions, while at the same time encouraging - through subsidies and favourable tax regimes - the further exploration and development of fossil fuels. Marshall said this was due to people’s ability to compartmentalise and shape the issue of climate change according to their own biases. “I interviewed Sir John Houghton, the founding chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), who said that if we talked about oil and gas, that’s a policy, and we don’t do policy as scientists,” he said. “We lost track of the wider issue, which is why the divestment campaign is extremely important,” he said, adding that the upcoming UN Climate Change Conference in Paris needed to introduce a legal cap on fossil fuel extraction to really challenge vested interests. Our signals on climate change don’t line up Marshall said his research showed that people were concerned about climate change when asked about it, but wouldn’t mention it at all if unprompted. “There’s something peculiar there.” This can, he said, be explained by cognitive science. Our affective reasoning or decision making, “is driven by cues, signals, and above all by bias”. “It’s the process of dis-attention that’s more important to our functioning than attention,” said Marshall. “We willingly dis-attend everything, but some things have signals that say ‘listen to me’”. The most important of these signals are proximity, which is in Marshall’s words, “something that’s here and now,” along with social cues from people within our circle, or an identifiable external threat. “So for us to pay attention to something on the scale of climate change, that requires us to shift everything, we need a string of these signals to all line up,” said Marshall, comparing it to a New York street with all the traffic lights on green.  For the majority of people, Marshall says, these signals aren’t lined up on climate change and the overwhelming scientific evidence isn’t enough to prevent them from continuing to ignore it.  Climate change is a shape shifting issue “The best metaphor I could find as to what I thought was happening to public opinion was rather like the climate models themselves: that there’s a set of feedbacks,” said Marshall. “People in all countries hugely overestimate the level of disbelief in climate change. We misread the social cues, therefore we keep quiet because we think other people will disagree with us. It’s a positive feedback.” Recounting a dispiriting conversation he’d had with the leading behavioural psychologist Professor Daniel Kahneman, Marshall said climate change constitutes “the impossible problem”, with the perfect combination of people’s natural biases against the future, costs, and uncertainty. “Here you have a situation which involves certain costs in the short-term in order to avoid potentially larger but uncertain costs at some point in the future.” “What makes it challenging is it’s a shape-shifting issue very open to bias and interpretation, because it can be in the past, in the present, in the future, it can be you causing, or me causing it or the oil companies,” he said. We need to start talkingSo what can we do in the meantime? As well as recognising our differences and trying to cooperate positively on the issue, Marshall gave this advice: “We have to challenge this pervasive silence, which is comparable to the silence we’ve had on other progressive issues, like racism and gender equality. One of the first things that worked with those is a determination to talk about it – don’t silence us.” “In the end, though, I think what shifts people is the expression of your personal commitment. The fact that you sincerely and utterly accept something that’s important to you is in itself a very much more powerful conveyor of change than hitting someone over the head with the IPCC report.”  George Monbiot was talking to George Marshall at a Guardian Live event in London.

"The world is starting to realise that fossil fuels are not cheap. It is increasingly clear that oil, coal and gas have huge hidden costs that are omitted from prices, and they are therefore heavily subsidised.  The latest evidence about how expensive fossil fuels really are has been provided this week by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), an organisation that monitors the progress of the world’s economy. It estimates that oil, coal and gas will receive US$5.3tn in subsidies this year around the world. That is the equivalent of 6.3% of global GDP. The IMF correctly argues that the damages and costs caused by fossil fuels, through impacts such as air pollution, congestion, traffic accidents and climate change, should be treated as subsidies if they are not included in the prices paid for oil, coal and gas. The increase from previous estimates is due to a number of factors, particularly a deepening understanding of the immense costs of air pollution. The unpriced costs of fossil fuels are in addition to, and much greater than, the direct financial support for fossil fuels through, for instance, tax breaks for oil and gas exploration and subsidies for consumers. The IMF points out that coal receives the biggest subsidies worldwide, and has the largest negative impact on human health through the pollution that it causes. While the IMF’s figures are eyewateringly large, they are, if anything, conservative because they are based on low estimates of the costs of climate change from the US government, which tends to omit many of the largest risks. While the IMF offers a regional breakdown, there are no figures for individual countries. However, there is much evidence that the subsidies in the UK are large, as air pollution from use of fossil fuels has an enormous impact. In its ruling last month that the UK government must submit new air quality plans to the European Commission by the end of the year, the supreme court recognised that microscopic particles produced by the burning of diesel and other sources are responsible for the equivalent of 29,000 premature deaths each year in Britain, more than 10 times the number of fatalities from road accidents. So the costs of fossil fuels are paid through the death and illness of present and future generations. That is why it is so important to create a level playing field for alternative energy sources and help to propel our economies away from their dependence on dirty and expensive fossil fuels. To achieve this, direct subsidies for the production and consumption of oil, coal and gas must end, as the G20 group of countries with the largest economies have made clear at their last few annual summits. But governments must also start to implement policies that properly price in the hidden costs of fossil fuels. With oil prices currently at a low level, now would be the ideal time to introduce levies that remove the implicit subsidy for pollution from petrol and diesel. The revenue from these levies could more than compensate the poorer members of the community for the price increases, give a boost to research and innovation, and contribute to the cleaner and more attractive investments that we need. This will also help to encourage the development of public transport, much of it electric, and better planning for our cities, so that they are less polluted and congested. This is what a low-carbon transition means for the world, and it could unleash a period of innovation and creativity that would drive prosperity and growth in rich and poor countries alike."

"A top conservationist has called on world leaders and environmentalists to urgently renew their focus on the state of tropical rainforests, arguing that the issue has dropped off the political agenda even though the world is “not far away from a dangerous tipping point”. Claude Martin, the author of a report on the precarious health of tropical forests and a former head of the WWF, said the world ignored the plight of forests at its peril, calling them “vital to the future of humanity” and stressing that governments needed “a wake-up call”.  “Tropical rainforests have disappeared from the political radar, having been at the centre of the environmental debate in the 80s and 90s,” Martin said at the launch in Berlin of On the Edge, which was commissioned by the global thinktank Club of Rome. “We need renewed political will to trigger a global conscience about this issue.  “Governments are too focused on other environmental issues, as if the forest problems had gone away, when in fact they’re getting worse every day.” He said that while the world’s remaining tropical rainforests cover 16m sq km of land – an area nearly the size of Russia – every year a piece of land “the size of Switzerland is being lost”, mainly to agriculture. The book’s launch came two days after the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and her French counterpart, François Hollande, urged 33 environmental ministers to commit to clear, concrete pledges to cut greenhouse gases. The ministers were in Berlin ahead of a United Nations summit in Paris later this year aimed at producing a new worldwide deal on global warming. Martin, who headed the WWF between 1993 and 2005, added: “About half the world’s tropical rainforests remain intact. If we don’t manage to protect them, the sixth mass extinction will become reality in the lifetime of our children and grandchildren. We are literally eating up the rainforest and are not far away from a dangerous tipping point.” Martin said it was time to “put on the agenda once again an issue that has been pushed on to the back-burner”. He said that consumers needed to be made aware of the direct role they could play in putting pressure on politicians and business, by consciously choosing products that were certified “free of the deforestation chain”. On the Edge provides an up-to-date portrait of the health of the world’s rainforests. It brings together satellite imaging and data gathered by economic and ecological experts to predict the likely future of the forests over the next few decades. Martin said it was “totally underestimated” by many, including scientists, the extent to which rainforests were increasingly unable to contribute towards managing the threat of climate change. “For a long time the hope had been that the tropical rainforests could absorb half of the fossil fuel emissions we are producing. But the more the forests become the victims of climate change themselves, because of increasing levels of drought, the more they are in danger of turning into a source of CO2. If we reach the two degree [centigrade] threshold by the middle of this century, many of the forests will turn into a CO2 source and that would effectively lead to a very dangerous tipping point for humanity.” On the Edge follows in the tradition of The Limits to Growth, the first report to the Club of Rome in 1972, which triggered an environmental debate that is still continuing and was credited with kickstarting the green movement."
"The insurance company Axa has said it will remove around €500m (£355m) of coal investments from its portfolio, in a move that reflects long-term concerns in the insurance industry over climate change. The company has also pledged to triple its investments in green technologies and services to more than €3bn by 2020 and provide investors with more information on the risk to its investments from climate change. Henri de Castries, chairman and chief executive of the French insurer, said the company’s duty to its shareholders and policyholders dictated the decision, citing current scientific advice that the world must avoid warming of greater than 2C above pre-industrial levels to avoid the worst consequences of climate change. He said: “It is our responsibility, as a long-term institutional investor, to consider carbon as a risk and to accompany the global energy transition. The burning of coal to produce energy is today, clearly, one of the biggest obstacles from reaching the 2C target.” He added: “For this reason, Axa has decided to divest from the companies most exposed to coal-related activities.” But this would only apply to “assets managed internally”, he said. The company said it would remove from its portfolio and refrain from future investment in mining companies that derive more than half of their turnover from coal mining, and in electrical utilities that take more than half of their energy from thermal coal power plants. The partial divestment was accompanied by the caveat that the company would rely on specialist data providers to identify the companies involved, and the new investment criteria would not extend to “other carbon-intensive industries or other types of coal-related businesses for which exposure data is insufficiently reliable”. The divestment applies only to the company’s general account. Companies with fossil fuel investments have come under pressure in recent years to disclose their exposure to the risk of climate change. The Guardian’s Keep it in the ground campaign has highlighted fossil fuel divestment and called on the Wellcome Trust and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, to divest from fossil fuel assets. Christiana Figueres, the UN’s top official on climate change, said governments could set the direction on reducing emissions, but that businesses must be the “engine of change”.  François Hollande, the president of France, urged pension funds in particular to disclose their risk from fossil fuel assets, at a conference this week in Paris focusing on business and climate change. This December, world governments will meet in Paris to forge a new global agreement on climate change, with commitments from both developed and developing countries to limit greenhouse gas emissions, with a view to remaining within the 2C threshold that scientists say is necessary if global warming is not to become catastrophic and irreversible."
"The last few days have seen a tussle between big businesses over whether or not Britain should stay in the EU. But a focus solely on corporate interests undermines the issues at the heart of this debate. The EU is more than just a market. Indeed, with the rise of multinational corporations increasingly capturing our national politics, EU protections for workers’ rights give us some comfort in the face of cuts to so-called red tape. The EU has also brought in a cap on bankers’ bonuses and a tax on City speculation. With the Tories determined to water down these EU rules, it’s vital we fight to maintain them. And, of course, it’s only by working with other countries that we’re going to face down future environmental crises. EU countries have been able to commit an entire continent to minimum carbon reduction targets – and the next few years are crucial for strengthening these goals. Britain leaving the EU would seriously undermine our role in the fight against climate change. The Green party welcomes the EU referendum, though we are clear that we don’t want business-as-usual to continue. Indeed, with the looming threat of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership deal it’s clear that we must act now to ensure the EU doesn’t become a vehicle for a race to the bottom on environmental and social protections. But the fact remains that Britain is better when we work with our neighbours to find solutions to the shared problems we face. We’ll be campaigning to be part of an EU that protects workers, takes bold action on climate change and stands up to corporate interests. It’s time to take the debate back from business and hand it over to people.Natalie Bennett Green party leader, Caroline Lucas MP Brighton Pavilion, Keith Taylor MEP South East England, Jean Lambert MEP London, Molly Scott Cato MEP South West England • Bless you for your impressive coverage (19 May) of the IMF’s call for an end to the obscenity of global subsidies to fossil fuels – a step that it calls a “game-changer” for human social welfare, as well as the climate. I note also its point that a price on carbon that genuinely reflects its social costs would obviate the need for other subsidies: those for alternative energy. British Columbia has just run a remarkably successful five-year experiment in carbon pricing, with a revenue-neutral carbon tax that not only substantially reduced emissions but included a perceptible rise in jobs and growth. It can be done. And with the revenue returned to households (whether by tax cuts or a straightforward monthly dividend), it can be a total win-win. I urge concerned readers to Google Citizens’ Climate Lobby and join an increasingly powerful – and increasingly global – movement to put a genuinely effective price on carbon.Judy HindleyMarlborough, Wiltshire"

"Scientists and world leaders have agreed that to avoid environmental catastrophes like super droughts and mass extinctions, the Earth’s temperature cannot exceed 2C above pre-industrial levels. But the world is quickly burning through the amount of carbon dioxide it can emit to avoid that level of global warming – and some warn we’ll have exhausted the carbon budget within 30 years. While governments around the world have committed to reducing their emissions, the corporate world is lagging behind, according to a new report from CDP, a London-based nonprofit that collects and distributes data on corporate environmental impacts.  Released Wednesday, the Mind the Science report delivered a sobering set of conclusions about climate change, criticizing companies for failing to adhere to targets that might help avoid catastrophic warming. The good news is that companies are recognizing the very real threat of climate change and taking steps to mitigate its effects. According to the report, 81% of the world’s 500 largest companies have set targets to reduce their carbon footprints.  The bad news is that most companies aren’t doing enough. The report looked at 70 of the most energy-intensive companies across the aluminum, cement, chemicals and electric utility sectors. Together, these companies were responsible for 9% of global emissions in 2014.  According to the report, only six of those companies, including Hong Kong-based utility CLP and Swiss cement company Holcim, had set long term targets that were large enough to help keep warming within 2C. Twenty two of the companies haven’t publicly declared an emission reduction target, and nine companies don’t even monitor or report their C02 emissions.  “It’s a very significant fraction,” said Pedro Faria, author of the report. “It’s a point of concern that there is no real transparency in terms of the amount of C02 they put into the atmosphere each year.”   Of the companies that have set emissions targets, few have long term targets in place that extend beyond 2030. The report suggests that when a company’s short term goals expire in the next few years, businesses should set new targets that are more aligned with contemporary climate science.  Faria said setting long term goals – and soon – is especially important for energy-intensive companies, which will likely need to invest in a lot of new, high tech equipment to reduce emissions. “Their capital assets last decades, so investment made now will have impacts on their emissions in 20, 30 or 40 years,” Faria said. “They need to have this long term vision.” But some companies are doing it right. The report highlighted a few that are setting ambitious, scientifically-backed goals. NRG Energy Inc, the largest US power producer, has committed to cutting its greenhouse gas emissions 90% by 2050, while Italian power company Enel plans to be carbon neutral by then. Swedish retail giant H&M and food group Nestle also have committed to setting long term, science-based targets.  Setting ambitious emissions goals is not only good for the environment, but it’s also good for business. According to the report, companies that set CO2 targets were more profitable than those that didn’t, delivering 9.9% in returns over a 12-month period compared to 9.2% for companies without goals.  In conjunction with the report, the CDP on Wednesday announced a global campaign to urge companies to align greenhouse gas emissions targets with climate science. The Science Based Targets Initiative, launched in collaboration with UN Global Compact, the World Resources Institute and the World Wildlife Foundation, aims to enlist 100 companies by the end of this year and 250 companies by 2020.  “These companies know that science-based targets are in their long term interest, and they are ready to lead in the low carbon economy of the future,” said Cynthia Cummis, deputy director of the Greenhouse Gas Protocal at the World Resources Institute, a global research organization that focuses on sustainability. “We hope this critical mass will be the tipping point to making science-based emissions targets standard business practice.”  The Science Behind Sustainability Solutions blog is funded by Arizona State University Walton Sustainability Solutions Initiatives.

"Most major companies have taken steps to improve their environmental profile, if only by becoming more efficient or cutting down on waste. Dow Chemical Co intends to go a lot further, declaring that it wants to change the very role of business in society. The chemical manufacturing giant has set itself a sweeping series of sustainability goals, which it claims will not merely reduce its own impact but also drive environmentally responsible practices at other companies. The set of seven goals, announced last month, include “developing breakthrough innovations,” “valuing nature” and “engaging employees for impact”. All together, they aim to improve the lives of 1 billion and deliver $1bn in cost savings and new cash flow for the company.  “We’re really focusing on taking the science and technology of Dow and devoting our efforts to finding new ways of doing business that will help companies collectively change our role in society,” says Neil Hawkins, Dow’s corporate vice president and chief sustainability officer. Andrew Winston, a sustainability consultant and author, calls the goals “really impressive”. “Dow joins a very small number of companies setting goals about the impacts of their products across the life cycle and setting society-level impact goals,” he says. “I think Dow has hit the mark very well on thinking big and aspirational while putting concrete markers of progress in place.” Sheila Bonini, CEO of The Sustainability Consortium, called the plan “admirable”, while David Levine, co-founder and CEO of the American Sustainable Business Council, called the goals “encouraging”. “There’s a legacy of producing chemicals that are harmful to environment and people, so efforts to develop and implement sustainability plans that incorporate public and environmental health can be important steps down a sustainability path,” he says.  This is the third time the Michigan-based company has announced sustainability goals, to be met over a 10-year period. They’ve grown bolder with each go around, reflecting the rising expectations for companies that want to be seen as sustainability leaders.  Dow’s first set of goals, laid out in 1995, focused on reducing the company’s carbon footprint. A decade later, the company shifted the focus to its “handprint” by addressing social as well as environmental challenges. For example, Dow partnered with consumer goods company Unilever to create a high quality, affordable soap to improve personal hygiene in India and prevent the spread of infectious diseases.  Experts say setting and announcing sustainability goals holds companies accountable, and can spur dialogue and innovation. “I believe this practice is even more important for companies in industries with questionable histories as it serves to put them in the public spotlight, make them answer some questions that they may not have previously asked, and ultimately can be a means through which to make them better,” said Robert Strand, executive director at the Center for Responsible Business at the University of California at Berkeley’s Haas School of Business, of which Dow is a corporate partner. Dow’s image could use a boost. The company recently announced that it would be cutting its global workforce by nearly 3% – roughly 1,500 to 1,750 positions – as part of its move away from the chlorine business. And last week, Dow defended its CEO Andrew Liveris against allegations that he had used company funds to finance his lavish lifestyle. The company also has a long way to go to overhaul its reputation as a polluter. “Companies like Dow have a lot of money to do this kind of PR, and they do it because it works,” said Rick Hind, legislatives director of Greenpeace’s toxics campaign. “But it doesn’t really address the lion’s share of contamination that they’re responsible for.” Environmental activists at Greenpeace and others say Dow failed to take responsibility for one of the worst gas leaks in history, which killed thousands of people at a chemical plant owned by Union Carbide in Bhopal, India, in 1984. Dow, which took ownership of Union Carbide in 2001 and never owned the plant in question, has called attempts to involve it in subsequent criminal proceedings “highly inappropriate”. Closer to home, Dow has admitted to contaminating the water near its corporate headquarters in Midland, Michigan, for nearly a century with dioxins, a group of highly toxic chemicals that can cause cancer and other illnesses, according to the World Health Organization. On the other hand, Dow has been called a pioneer when it comes to valuing natural capital, or the benefits businesses get from nature. Working in a six-year partnership with The Nature Conservancy at factories in Texas and Brazil, Dow has found, among other things, that large scale reforestation can be a cost effective way to reduce air pollution from a chemical plant. As for Dow’s new goals, they are just that – goals. Dow says it has yet to launch the specific initiatives tied to each one.  “We’re saying this is where we want to go,” Hawkins says. “Then we call upon the creativity and passion of our 50,000-plus employees [to put forward] collaborations they’d like to bring into the company to drive sustainable development.”  Of the latest goals, “advancing a circular economy” – reusing products instead of disposing of them – and “leading the blueprint” have the potential to really drive change, according to Hawkins. While he couldn’t specify new projects, Hawkins pointed to the company’s existing wastewater recycling program at its plant in the Netherlands as an initiative that will help create a more circular economy. The factory, located in the small seaport town of Terneuzen, uses around 22m cubic meters of water each year. To reduce water stress, Dow recycles 30,000 cubic meters of household wastewater each day, purifying it to make steam and feed its manufacturing plants. The company claims the program reduces energy by 95%, equivalent to 60,000 tons per year of carbon dioxide emissions. Dow will also look at ways to reuse its plastic waste, Hawkins says, and also plans to focus on ways to help make agriculture, technology and the electronics industry more sustainable.  The company’s 2014 Energy Bag Pilot Program, a three-month project that converted previously non-recycled plastics into energy, is one example of the kinds of innovation Dow hopes to replicate. Dow co-sponsored the program with the California city of Citrus Heights, among others. According to Dow, this was a first-of-its-kind pilot in the US, which revealed that plastic items like juice pouches and candy wrappers could be collected and recycled.  The company hopes to lead the way in developing new approaches to sustainability challenges by creating a “blueprint” with the help of governments, NGOs and the private sector, he says. Dow has taken a risk in declaring such big, bold aspirations, especially given it hasn’t yet articulated how it will achieve them.  “I think by aligning business interests with societal interests, everybody will be trying to pull the boat in the same way, which I think minimizes risk for everyone,” Hawkins says.

"The chairman of the world’s biggest commodity trader has called for an end to subsidies for fossil fuels. Tony Hayward, the chairman of Glencore Xstrata, told a conference on climate and business in Paris that the subsidies were incompatible with combating climate change. He also called on rich countries to provide financial assistance that would allow poorer ones to cut their greenhouse gas emissions using renewable energy.  But Hayward, who headed the oil giant BP during the Gulf oil spill disaster, added an important caveat: subsidies must be eliminated as a prelude to setting a tax or price on carbon dioxide emissions, he said.  This would mean delaying carbon pricing until the end of subsidies has been achieved – a goal that has eluded the world despite many years of urging from influential groups, such as the International Energy Agency. Glencore has major interests in fossil fuels and other commodities that would be hit by a carbon tax or other form of carbon pricing. The call to end subsidies for fossil fuels echoes one from Lord Stern, the former World Bank chief economist, in the Guardian this week. But Lord Stern has also called for a price to be set on carbon dioxide, as an urgent way of encouraging businesses to cut their greenhouse gas emissions. A report published on Thursday by Thomson Reuters found that the greenhouse gas emissions from 32 of the world’s biggest energy companies, which make up nearly a third of global carbon output, had risen by 1.3% in the period from 2010 to 2013, in marked contrast to scientific recommendations that their carbon should be cut significantly if the world is to avoid dangerous levels of global warming. Business leaders were meeting in Paris this week, under the auspices of the French government, to prepare for a crunch conference this December, also in Paris, at which world governments have promised to forge a new global agreement on climate change, to take over from current commitments to limit emissions that expire in 2020. The issue of how developing countries should lift their populations from poverty – and whether this will require the use of fossil fuels, or can take place along cleaner lines – is set to be a key issue at the talks later this year. Some countries, and many climate sceptics, argue that poorer nations should be allowed to use high-carbon fuels to build their economies, as industrialised nations have done over the last century and a half. Ali Al-Naimi, the oil minister of Saudi Arabia, told the conference that without fossil fuels, “we would not be where we are now” in terms of economic development. He noted that more than 1bn people today still lack access to electricity, which deprives them of economic and educational opportunities. But he also said that his country – the world’s biggest oil exporter was working towards a future, potentially within a few decades, in which fossil fuels would no longer be needed. This would include plans, previously laid out, to build a massive network of solar power that could be exported to other countries. The World Bank called for investment in renewable energy, for poorer countries in particular, to be tripled by 2030, to about $1.3tn annually. This would help to lift people from poverty and provide countries with a way out of the problems of air pollution, much of which is caused by the use of coal-fired power generation. Segolene Royal, the French minister for environment who will lead the Paris summit in December, told the business and climate conference that developing countries should be enabled to pursue economic growth in a low-carbon fashion, rather than industrialising their economies using fossil fuels.  She said: “Africa [and other developing countries] have the right to develop without fossil fuels.” This would provide an opportunity to create jobs and reduce poverty, she said, and called for “stable and clear” rules to be set at the December conference. She said: “When the cause of the environment progresses, so does democracy and so does peace.” Credit Agricole, the French bank, said that it would cut its financing for fossil fuel development, the second major bank to do so after Bank of America."

"A security guard hired by Edinburgh University has been filmed allegedly assaulting a student as he protests against the university’s decision not to divest from fossil fuels. The footage, filmed by another protester, shows the security guard pushing the student to the ground and placing his hand around his throat.  He steps away from the prone protester after another guard pulls him away. Around 15 protesters had gathered at 8am on Thursday outside Charles Stewart House on Chambers Street, which houses the university’s finance department, to peacefully picket the building, after being refused access to the ongoing occupation of the central lobby inside. Over 30 students began the sit-in last Wednesday following the decision by the university court the previous day not to divest from fossil fuels. Speaking from inside the occupation, Kirsty Haigh of the Edinburgh University People and Planet group said that her fellow protesters were “very shaken” by the incident. She said that the police had been called and were currently taking witness statements relating to an allegation of assault. Another protester, Eric Lai, condemned the guard’s actions. “We have been repeatedly told that the university supports our right to protest, but that couldn’t feel further from the truth.” “The university have posted dozens of guards to the doors, and have now taken to intimidation and violence to shut us up. It is hard to imagine a more inappropriate way to handle student protest.” The university told the Guardian that the security guard seen on the video was not a university employee, but had been “contracted in from a security group contracted to help manage and police the protest”.  An Edinburgh University spokesperson said: “The university is aware of, and deeply regrets, the unfortunate incident that is currently being played on social media. The matter is now in the hands of the police.” “We continue to support the right of students to peacefully and lawfully demonstrate and theuniversity is using private security outside its buildings in Chambers Street in order to secure the safety of staff and students during the occupation.” Police Scotland confirmed that they had detained two men for questioning in relation to the incident. Climate change campaigners across the globe reacted with disappointment last week as Edinburgh University set out the unanimous decision by the court not to fully divest from fossil fuels. Insisting that the university remained committed to a change of investment policy, senior vice principal Prof Charlie Jeffery said: “Our commitment is to engage before divestment, but the expectation is that we will bring about change by engagement.” Outlining what is essentially a company-by-company approach, Jeffery said that the university would divest from companies involved in the extraction of coal and tar sands, only where feasible alternative sources of energy exist, and where companies do not invest in low carbon technologies."
"In a campaign event last week, Republican presidential frontrunner Jeb Bush exhibited Stage 2 climate denial, saying (video available here), Look, first of all, the climate is changing. I don’t think the science is clear what percentage is man-made and what percentage is natural. It’s convoluted. And for the people to say the science is decided on, this is just really arrogant, to be honest with you. It’s this intellectual arrogance that now you can’t even have a conversation about it.  Unfortunately, denial of human-caused global warming may be a prerequisite for any viable Republican presidential candidate. Conservative and Tea Party Republicans are the one group of American voters among whom Stage 2 climate denial is the majority position, but they’re also the group that most reliably votes in GOP primary elections.  In American politics, a candidate first has to win a primary election before reaching the national ballot. For Republicans, that means appealing to conservatives. It’s not clear that a Republican presidential candidate can accept climate science and run a viable primary campaign. Nevertheless, the scientific evidence supporting human-caused global warming is just as strong as the evidence linking smoking and lung cancer. Last year, the IPCC stated with 95% confidence that humans are the main cause of the global warming that’s occurred since 1950. Their best estimate is that we’re responsible for about 100% of the warming during the past six decades. Gavin Schmidt, Director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, put together this graph showing what’s known as the probability density function of the human contribution to global warming since 1950, based on the IPCC report. As the figure shows, natural factors have most likely caused a slight cooling since 1950, meaning that human factors are most likely responsible for all the warming we’ve seen and then some (110%). The odds that natural factors are responsible for the majority of global warming over the past six decades is virtually zero. This assessment is based on multiple lines of evidence. There are climate model simulations, which can’t account for the observed warming without a dominant influence from the increased greenhouse effect. There are “fingerprints” of human-caused global warming, which are effects we expect to see in the patterns of climate change if those changes are due to the increased greenhouse effect. I explain some of these in one of my Denial101x lectures. Basic physics is perhaps the most convincing piece of evidence behind human-caused global warming. Long-term global warming and cooling events are caused by changes in the Earth’s energy balance. If there’s more incoming than outgoing energy, the planet warms, and vice-versa. Natural variability, like ocean cycles, only causes short-term temperature changes. Since 1950, the Earth has had a large and growing energy imbalance due almost entirely to the human-caused increased greenhouse effect. There’s actually been a slight decrease in incoming energy from the sun during that time, an hence a slight solar cooling effect.  Overall, the energy imbalance (a.k.a. radiative forcing) from the increased greenhouse effect has caused more warming than we’ve observed, having been offset by some cooling from other human pollutants (aerosols) blocking sunlight, as shown in this figure from the IPCC report.  And of course because of these many lines of overwhelming evidence, there’s a 97% consensus among climate scientists and in their peer-reviewed climate research on human-caused global warming. There are a few outlier climate scientists who disagree, like Judith Curry, who incorrectly claimed “Jeb gets it exactly right,” but these contrarians are a slim minority.  As the evidence clearly shows, Jeb got it exactly wrong. It’s not arrogant to accept the overwhelming preponderance of scientific evidence, basic physics, or a 97% expert consensus; rather, it’s ignorant to deny it.  At the same campaign event, Bush ironically claimed, I think, as conservatives, we should embrace innovation, embrace technology, embrace science; it’s the source of a lot more solutions than any government-imposed idea. Yes, the conservative presidential frontrunner suggested that conservatives should embrace science just a few moments after he rejected the science on global warming. Nevertheless, a candidate’s favored policies are more important than his acceptance or rejection of science. Unfortunately, while Bush suggested that conservatives embrace technology, he only specifically supported natural gas, We’ve had a decrease [in carbon emissions], a pretty significant decrease and it will continue on, not because of Barack Obama, but because of the energy revolution, because of free-enterprise, because of private property rights because of American innovation has created a combination of two existing technologies: hydraulic fracking and horizontal drilling has created an explosion of lower carbon energy that is being used to replace higher carbon energy. Research has shown that at best, natural gas can only act as a (short) bridge fuel during the transition to low-carbon energy sources if we want to avoid dangerous global warming, and in fact it might not even be a suitable bridge. In any case, “we should embrace innovation, embrace technology” is not a concrete policy platform.  Bush clearly opposes the legally-mandated government regulations of carbon pollution enacted by the Obama administration. However, it’s the Democratic Party that’s supported free-market carbon pricing policy alternatives, even offering small-government revenue-neutral compromise legislation. While the Republican Party and the fossil fuel industry have tried to repeal the government regulations, they haven’t accepted that compromise offer or proposed any alternative policies of their own. Bush also tried to pass the buck, claiming that other countries are responsible for solving the problem, we need to encourage the (nations) states that have had an increase in carbon emissions, We’re not one of them!  It’s true that the USA has seen a modest decline in its carbon pollution in recent years. However, claiming that other countries are now responsible for solving the problem is like a 400 lb. man who loses 10 lbs. claiming that 250 lb. men are now responsible for solving America’s epidemic of obesity. It’s especially irresponsible given that Jeb Bush hails from Florida, which has at least $145 bn in property value lying less than 1 meter above the high-tide line, with sea level likely to rise by about 1 meter by the end of the century if we continue with the status quo. Although it’s moving in the right direction, thanks in large part to the Obama Administration’s efforts to tackle the problem, the USA is still one of the world’s largest carbon polluters in terms of both total and per capita emissions. That won’t change until the Republican Party stops denying science and starts taking the problem seriously."

"Hundreds of activists decked out in neoprene wetsuits and life jackets took to the waters of Elliott Bay on Saturday. In kayaks, canoes, paddleboards and other vessels, they sent the message that Royal Dutch Shell should cancel its plan to drill in the Arctic Ocean. The “Paddle in Seattle” – a daylong, family friendly festival in a West Seattle park and an on-the-water protest by “Shell no” kayaktivists – was held only blocks from where Shell’s Polar Pioneer drilling rig is docked at the Port of Seattle’s Terminal 5. The brightly colored boats lined the grass as paddlers loaded gear while lights on the towering rig twinkled in the background. Once out on the water, kayakers gathered in formation and hoisted signs and banners that read: “Climate Justice”, “Oil-Free Future”, “Shell No, Seattle Draws The Line”, and “We can’t burn all the oil on the planet and still live on it”. Many had posters or red scarfs that had the Shell logo with crossed kayak paddles underneath – resembling the skull-and-crossbones image. Eric Day, with the Swinomish Indian Tribe, was one of many Native American paddlers who brought their canoes to the event. Drilling in the Arctic would hurt those who live off the land, he said. “This is our livelihood. We need to protect it for the crabbers, for the fishermen,” Day said. “We need to protect it for our children.” Annie Leonard, executive director of Greenpeace USA, said there is a long list of reasons why drilling in the Arctic is a bad idea. The focus should be on renewable energy in this time of climate change, not dirty fuels, she said. “Why would we invest in an energy source that scientists say is leading us to catastrophe?” Leonard said. Many also fear that an oil spill in such a delicate and remote region would be a disaster on many levels. Greg Huyler, a 51-year-old scuba diver from Yakima, Washington, stood on the sidewalk and shook his head in opposition to the event. “It’s a bunch of crap,” he said. “The problem is, all of these kayaks are petroleum products, and they’re going to gripe about drilling for oil. And 90% of them drove here in cars that use petroleum products.” India Briggs, a 14-year-old from Cle Elum, Washington, said she and her parents drove two hours to make their voices heard. “I’m happy people want to join together to take a stand on climate change,” she said. Her father, Jim Briggs, added that drilling in the Arctic would be deeply disrespectful to the Inuit peoples who live in that region. Alli Harvey, Alaska representative for the Sierra Club’s Our Wild America campaign, said: “Science is as clear as day when it comes to drilling in the Arctic: the only safe place for these dirty fuels is in the ground.” At the center of the paddle protest was the “People’s Platform”, a 4,000-square-foot barge powered by renewable energy, said Jonathon Berman with the Sierra Club. The platform was used as a stage for speakers, a band and a tall screen that showed images of people expressing their opposition to Shell’s plans. Just a quarter-mile away from the Seacrest Marine Park sits the 400-foot long, 300-foot tall Polar Pioneer, the first of two oil drilling rigs that Royal Dutch Shell plans to use this summer as it explores for oil off Alaska’s northern coast. The second rig, the Noble Discoverer, arrived at the Port of Everett last week and is slated join the Polar Pioneer at the Port of Seattle’s Terminal 5 at a later date. Everett port spokeswoman Lisa Lefeber said on Friday that they expect the Noble Discoverer to be there for two to three weeks. The Arctic holds about 30% of the world’s undiscovered natural gas and 13% of its oil, according to Shell’s website. “This amounts to around 400 billion barrels of oil equivalent, 10 times the total oil and gas produced in the North Sea to date,” Shell’s site says. “Developing Arctic resources could be essential to securing energy supplies for the future, but it will mean balancing economic, environmental and social challenges.” The activists see it differently, however. The protesters say it’s critical that they take a stand “against dirty fossil fuel projects”. They want to put themselves on the front lines in the battle for Arctic oil."

"Today the low carbon economy is worth over £3tn. This fact is just one of many showing how far the business case for addressing climate change has come, with smart businesses broadening their strategy beyond risk management to value creation. Business leaders who shared their vision of a low-carbon future in Paris this week echoed this sentiment, calling on governments to lock in the right frameworks and targets to help deliver this goal. Yet, despite the emphasis on government target setting, the goals that come from businesses are just as important. Balancing near-term targets with longer-term climate risks is one of the most complex risk management challenges facing company executives today. Businesses increasingly recognise that emissions reductions will need to be ambitious, because going over the 2C warming limit is not a viable economic option.  The good news is that many companies are already setting themselves greenhouse gas reduction goals. In 2014 over 80% of the world’s 500 largest companies reported having an emissions reduction target. But in this critical year for climate action, it is no longer sufficient to set just any target. For companies, figuring out how much greenhouse gas emissions they can continue to release is one of the biggest hurdles to framing their long term goals. Our analysis of 70 energy intensive companies shows that a small handful are leading the way by setting ambitious and long term emission reduction targets in line with climate science. However, most are not and the majority of targets reported through CDP tend not to extend beyond 2020, suggesting a lack of long-term strategy to stay within the global carbon budget. Rather than focusing on the inadequacy of most corporate climate targets, however, we need to better understand how we can help companies raise the bar in this critical area of climate action. To do this, we need to look at how companies set emissions reduction goals. This varies from sector to sector, but factors such as economic feasibility, compliance with current or expected regulation and stakeholder expectations all play a part. And while many companies are embedding sustainability into their business strategy, few in the corporate world have the expertise in aligning their goals with science. Those who shoulder the responsibility for setting these goals may be a mix of sustainability officers, accounting departments and management. It is not guaranteed that many, or any, of these individuals are greenhouse gas experts. Companies shouldn’t have to do this alone. As we have discovered at the Science Based Targets initiative – a collaboration between CDP, the UN Global Compact, WRI and WWF – it takes a lot of collaboration to develop a greenhouse gas reduction target or methodology.  French multinational L’Oréal, which aims to cut its absolute emissions by 60% from 2005 levels by 2020, spent two years developing its targets and consulted with several hundred organisations in the process. Enel, Italy’s largest power company and Europe’s second largest listed utility by installed capacity, announced this year together with Greenpeace its “shared view” of an energy system largely based on renewable sources. The company aims to be carbon neutral before 2050, putting it firmly in alignment with climate science. Crucially, both of these companies see these ambitious goals as helping to create resilience and add value to their business in the long term. Those in the most energy intensive sectors have the greatest potential for making emissions reductions. The new tool developed by the Science Based Targets initiative, together with technical support from consultancy firm Ecofys and an advisory committee including BT, Diageo and Mars, aims to help businesses in the most energy intensive sectors set meaningful targets. This methodology, called the Sectoral Decarbonization Approach, balances the level of ambition needed against the economic realities of operating in that sector. It also covers over 60% of current global greenhouse gas emissions and nearly 90% of the remaining carbon budget up to 2050. However, this is by no means a one-size-fits-all solution or a finished task. Companies should consider a wide range of methods and tools to choose the target that is right for both their business and the planet. What is critical is that they start to figure this out now. We will all benefit from new knowledge and understanding of this developing area as more businesses adopt science-based targets. As the UN climate chief Christiana Figueres notes: “Everybody has the obligation now to find out where they are going to be 50 years from now … We have run out of time to be asking the other person to come forward first.” The rethinking prosperity hub is sponsored by DNV GL.

"Norway’s best-known author has lashed out at “the shortsightedness and stupidity” of plans to expand oil exploration into the Arctic, as campaigners prepare to sue the government for placing future generations at risk from climate change. Karl Ove Knausgaard, whose bestselling memoir has been a global literary sensation, is fronting a campaign to mount a legal challenge against moves by Norway to open up the Arctic to oil companies.  Norway is one of the richest countries in the world – it’s all about greed, and it’s a fucking disgrace. Oil and gas extraction in the Arctic has nothing to do with worthwhile goals such as alleviating poverty, Knausgaard said. “Norway is one of the richest countries in the world – it’s all about greed, and it’s a fucking disgrace.” The environment was the single most important issue of our time, he said, and his feeling of helplessness in the face of environmental destruction made him “just turn away from it and try to think about something else”. But Arctic oil exploration was different, he said.  “The Arctic is one of the few places left on the planet that still is unexploited, it’s a very sensitive area, and I never believed that my government actually would do such a thing. We need to make them stop, and we still can do that. … The shortsightedness and the stupidity of it just makes me want to cry.” A petition launched by a senior barrister has gathered the signatures of 200 leading cultural figures and environmental organisations, who see it as a first step towards winning broad public support and raising the money needed for a court case in the autumn. The campaign aims to make use of a recent change to the constitution which obligates the state to take action to ensure natural resources are managed “on the basis of comprehensive long-term considerations”, including safeguarding the environment for future generations. “Persisting with business-as-usual extraction [of oil] on the Norwegian continental shelf contradicts the precautionary principle and climate scientists’ warnings,” the petition states. “Opening new areas of the Arctic for oil exploration would make Norway one of the frontrunners in a fossil-fuelled race towards an uninhabitable planet.”  The Norwegian government in January announced the first expansion of oil exploration into entirely new areas for 20 years, opening a licensing process in the Norwegian Sea, Barents Sea and waters that stretch some 40 miles further north to the edge of the Arctic sea ice. New and attractive exploration sites are important to long-term value creation and to maintaining the oil industry’s contribution to Norway’s welfare society, the government said when it announced the plan.  Although the price of oil collapsed on world markets last year, forcing oil companies to scale back their drilling plans, there is expected to be considerable interest in licences to exploit Arctic minerals, seen as lucrative assets for the longer term. The Arctic has been heralded as the next big frontier for oil exploration, with the region estimated to hold some 13% of the world’s undiscovered oil and 30% of its undiscovered gas.  Environmentalists received a setback this month when Shell won conditional approval for its Arctic exploration plans from the US regulator. Norway’s government insists that oil exploration is subject to stringent health, safety and environmental requirements.  Lars Andreas Lunde, environment secretary in Norway’s right-wing coalition government, said discharge permits for oil activities were granted by the Norwegian Environment Agency, and objections would be heard by the environment ministry. “This should ensure that no permits are granted unless the environmental challenges related to a specific activity are sufficiently dealt with and not putting the Arctic environment at risk,” he said. Oil continues to make a huge contribution to Norway’s prosperity – investment income from the country’s $916bn fund set up to manage oil profits is comfortably more than total public spending. But there are fears that reliance on oil is too great, and the government is actively trying to expand other sectors of the economy. It has also pledged to cut greenhouse gases emissions by 40% by 2030, a goal critics say sits uncomfortably besides aggressive exploration for oil and gas. The campaign by Norwegian environmentalists aims to mirror similar legal challenges in the Netherlands and in the US, where lawsuits have attempted to hold governments to account over climate change. In April, the Dutch Urgenda foundation launched the first case in the world to use human rights and tort law to hold a government responsible for failing to reduce carbon emissions fast enough. “Where do we draw the line if not in the Arctic?”said Åsne Seierstad, the bestselling Norwegian author and another signatory to the petition. “No economic policy is more short-term than relying on profits from the very areas that are worst affected from climate change.”"

"“Here’s my bet: the kids are going to win and when they do, it’s going to matter,” wagered the environmentalist Bill McKibben to Rolling Stone two years ago. He was on tour with a new campaign that was rapidly gaining traction on college campuses across the United States. Students were persuading their universities to withdraw their money from fossil fuels – the richest companies in the world.  Since McKibben’s climate movement 350.org launched its fossil fuel divestment campaign in 2012, more than 220 institutions – including universities, faith organisations, local authorities, pension funds and foundations – have committed to divesting from fossil fuels.   Syracuse University is the largest so far. It committed in April 2015 to divest its $1.18bn (£800m) endowment and to seek new investments in clean energy technologies. The decision came a year after Stanford University committed to move out of coal investments.  In 2013 the Fossil Free campaign was launched in the UK. It highlighted the £5bn held in universities’ endowments, with the first campaigns launching at Edinburgh, Birmingham and University College London. Yet it was the Quakers in Britain who became the first to divest in October that year.  By the end of the year, research by Oxford University suggested that it had become the fastest growing divestment campaign in history, surpassing those targeting the tobacco industry and apatheid in South Africa. The movement has only continued to accelerate.  The most symbolic announcement of all came in September 2014 as the heirs to Rockefeller oil fortune came on board, withdrawing the fossil fuel investments in the $860m Rockefeller Brothers Fund.  “We are quite convinced that if he [John D Rockefeller] were alive today, as an astute businessman looking out to the future, he would be moving out of fossil fuels and investing in clean, renewable energy,” said president Stephen Heintz. He made the statement as the fund joined with 800 global investors pledging to divest from fossil fuels ahead of a UN summit on climate change. In March 2015, the UN organisation responsible for coordinating a global climate change deal backed divestment saying it did so because “it sends a signal to companies, especially coal companies, that the age of ‘burn what you like, when you like’ cannot continue.” Moral victories were hailed as the World Council of Churches – which represents half a billion Christians – ruled out all fossil fuel investments in 2014 and the Church of England moved its £9bn fund out of thermal coal and tar sands in April.  “The church has a moral responsibility to speak and act on both environmental stewardship and justice for the world’s poor,” said Rev Canon Prof Richard Burridge, deputy chair of the CoE’s ethical investment advisory group that undertook the review.  In April, the Guardian’s parent company, Guardian Media Group said it would divest its £800m fund, becoming the largest to date to have made the commitment. Divesting from fossil fuels was “a hard-nosed business decision, influenced by the values of our organisation”, said GMG’s chair, Neil Berkett. The move followed a campaign launched by the Guardian calling on the world’s largest charitable foundations and funders of medical research – the Wellcome Trust and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation – to divest. High profile supporters include actor Tilda Swinton, chef Yotam Ottolenghi and activist Bianca Jagger. Meanwhile, the movement continues to grow on UK campuses. Last October Glasgow university became the first in Europe to commit to fossil fuel divestment. The university of Bedfordshire and Soas, University of London have since joined them. Oxford University, the second biggest by endowment in the country, has ruled out direct investments in coal and tar sands. As the campaign has grown, it has become more global, with institutions divesting from Sweden to New Zealand to the Marshall islands in the Pacific. It has provoked reactions from those in power, with Australian prime minister lambasting the Australian National University’s divestment as a “stupid decision” last year. The campaign was given a boost in April 2013 by the launch of a report by economist Nick Stern and thinktank Carbon Tracker which showed that overvaluation of fossil fuel reserves could be creating an investment bubble with the potential to plunge the world into deep financial crisis. It is estimated that if international agreements to avoid dangerous levels of climate change are heeded, two-thirds of fossil fuel reserves in the ground cannot be burned.  “Back in 2012, when we started fanning the divestment flames we had no idea what a wildfire would quickly spread around the world,” says Jamie Henn of 350.org. “People instantly understood the power of challenging institutions to put their money where their mouths are.”  April 2013 San Francisco and Seattle divest from fossil fuels October 2013 Quakers in Britain divest February 2014 New School, New York divests from fossil fuels May 2014 Stanford university divests from coal  June 2014 British Medical Association divests July 2014 World Council of Churches rules out fossil fuel investments September 2014 Rockefeller Brothers Fund divests from fossil fuels  September 2014 Oxford City council divests from fossil fuels October 2014 Glasgow University divests from fossil fuels  October 2014 Australian National University divests from fossil fuels November 2014 Victoria University, New Zealand divests from fossil fuels February 2015 New School, New York divests from fossil fuels April 2015 Syracuse University divests from fossil fuels April 2015 Guardian Media Group divests from fossil fuels April 2015 Soas, University of London divests from fossil fuels April 2015 Church of England divests from thermal coal and tar sands May 2015 London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine divests from coal May 2015 Oxford University rules out investing in coal and tar sands"
"Labor has enlisted the former climate change minister Greg Combet to help develop policies for the next election – including a new climate change stance – as the party debates how to make good its promise to reintroduce an emissions trading scheme. Combet has been employed part time by Labor’s national secretariat to help the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, as the party debates policy ahead of its July national conference and the next election, due in 2016.  Labor has yet to make basic decisions about how to implement Shorten’s pledge that it will continue to advocate an emissions trading scheme. Most are envisaging a new cap-and-trade scheme broadly similar to the one introduced during the last parliament, and repealed by the Abbott government. But some are pondering whether the “safeguards mechanism” in the government’s “Direct Action” policy could be dramatically strengthened, forcing polluting companies to reduce emissions or buy pollution permits on the domestic or international markets. This would create a type of emissions trading scheme, but require regulation rather than legislation. And others are concerned at the political and market instability that would flow from Labor putting up another ETS if it could not be passed into law, or if the Coalition again pledged to repeal it. They are determined Labor should have a credible means to achieve Australia’s emissions reductions, but are contemplating a two-stage policy, with immediate action on a stronger renewable energy target, environmental regulation and a strengthening of the existing laws, with an emissions trading scheme as a longer term policy once it has broader support. Shorten first recommitted Labor to taking a carbon price to the next election in an interview with Guardian Australia in March 2014, promising its climate change policy would include a “market-based system”. On the day the House of Representatives voted against the former government’s emissions trading scheme, Shorten told parliament a future Labor government would reintroduce one, saying “any serious policy solution to climate change must, sooner rather than later, include an emissions trading scheme”. But Labor appears to have made few concrete decisions about how to implement the leader’s promises. It is also waiting to see what the government announces as Australia’s post-2020 emissions reduction target. The decision is due late next month. The prime minister, Tony Abbott, has been criticising Labor for its intention to “bring back the carbon tax”, linking the charge to his claim that Labor is the party of “higher taxes”. Combet was elected in 2007 and did not recontest his NSW seat of Charlton in 2013. Since leaving politics he has worked in the superannuation industry. The opposition spokeswoman on families, Jenny Macklin, is spearheading the policy development process inside the parliamentary party."
"World governments must sign a clear new agreement on greenhouse gas emissions at a crunch conference in Paris this December, leaders of the world’s energy industry have urged. The World Energy Council (WEC) said policy uncertainty, and the lack of clear long-term goals on the climate, had hampered the industry’s ability to invest in low-carbon growth.   The organisation, representing major energy companies around the world, including those dependent on fossil fuels, said that $48tn (£31tn) to $53tn of investment would be needed, and could be delivered, if the world is to avoid dangerous climate change. The Council called for clear emissions targets to be set at Paris, and for a “flexible approach” to the needs of different countries. Christoph Frei, secretary general of the WEC, said: “It is increasingly clear that traditional mechanisms, known technology, policy and rates of innovation will not deliver the change needed to balance energy security concerns within countries and meet global climate targets. New and ambitious thinking is needed.  “This new thinking will require stable economic and policy platforms in order to boost investment and establish clear, consistent goals that guide the development of new energy infrastructure that will support the lower carbon transition.” The world already has clear targets on greenhouse gas emissions, set out by developed and major developing country governments in Copenhagen in 2009, and ratified the next year under the UN’s Cancun Agreements. Those targets, which run until 2020, are all still valid and have not been repealed. At Paris, governments are supposed to forge a new agreement with commitments from countries that will run beyond 2020, in some cases to 2025 and in others to 2030 and beyond. Several, including those from the US and the EU, have already been submitted to the UN, while China has provided a strong indication of its targets. More than 30 countries have submitted their targets so far. While many energy companies have publicly called for stronger policy on emissions, the Guardian has uncovered evidence of some fossil fuel companies lobbying against such measures. The WEC, accredited to the UN and due to be represented at the Paris talks, is made up of more than 3,000 member organisations, including private sector companies, state-backed companies and governments. In its report published on Wednesday, it also called for: the removal of trade barriers, such as tariffs, placed on the transfer of environmental goods and services across borders; governments to set a carbon price; provide better policy signals, and invest public money in projects that can gain private capital; greater energy efficiency; and collaboration between the public and private sectors on new technology. Joan MacNaughton, chair of the group that drew up the WEC report, said: “Our findings show that there is a real thirst for vigorous implementation of strong commitments – the focus now needs to move from negotiation to action.” She said that without a strong commitment from governments, it would “become increasingly difficult to deliver across the three goals of energy security, energy equity and environmental sustainability. As the energy industry is telling us, it is now time to get something done.” The WEC’s reports have in the past been directed at advising governments and the private sector, and it came up with the idea of an energy “trilemma” facing the world, meaning the triple need to tackle climate change, security of energy supply, and making energy accessible and affordable to all."

"The federal government has finalised a ban on the dumping of sediment from new dredging projects into the waters of the Great Barrier Reef, as a decision looms on whether the ecosystem will be listed as “in danger” by the UN. Greg Hunt, the federal environment minister, said he has approved an amendment to the Great Barrier Reef marine park regulations to ban capital dredge spoil being dumped there.   The ban will apply to all past, present and future applications for dumping of new seabed excavations undertaken in order to expand ports and shipping lanes in the 344,400 sq km marine park.  However, it will not apply to maintenance dredging of existing projects nor will it apply to the reef’s whole world heritage area, which is only slightly larger than the marine park but has been the site of most recent dumping. Hunt pointed out the Queensland government has pledged to ban dumping in the world heritage area, thus plugging this gap. “Together, this means no capital dredge disposal can occur in any part of the world heritage area,” Hunt said. “Protecting the reef’s immense biological, cultural and heritage values is a top priority for the Coalition government and we continue to build on our suite of protective measures.” Hunt approved a plan to dump five million tonnes of seabed sediment from the expansion of the Abbot Point port into the marine park in late 2013, only for an alternative land-based plan to be drawn up following an outcry. The UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) added its voice to those concerned about the sea-based disposal of sediment, which scientists warned could smother corals.  Unesco’s world heritage committee will meet in Bonn, Germany next month to decide whether to list the reef as “in danger”. The ecosystem has lost half its coral over the past 30 years and is under pressure from climate change, chemical pollution and a plague of coral-eating starfish. The Australian government has made strenuous diplomatic efforts to head off the “in danger” listing, which could negatively affect the $6bn-a-year tourism industry that relies upon the reef. Government ministers or diplomats have visited 19 of the 21 countries that provide members to the world heritage committee in recent months to explain the measures Australia is taking to protect the reef, which is the world’s largest living entity. On Friday the government announced it was introducing new restrictions on shipping in 565,000 sq km of the Coral Sea, to help ease concerns about increased ship movements near the reef.  An extra $100m has been pledged to help reduce chemicals flowing from farmland to the reef, as part of a $2bn package the government has touted as being spent on the reef’s health over the coming decade. However, environmental groups say the funding is nowhere near enough and the $2bn figure is misleading. “In fact nearly $500m, or a quarter of that $2bn, is being spent on maritime safety,” said Nick Heath, spokesman for the WWF. “It’s being spent on items like promoting maritime safety and providing a search and rescue service. “Legitimate spending – but it is not money going directly to bringing back coral, sea grass, turtles and fish.”"
"Public health experts involved in the response to the Ebola crisis have condemned what they described as a ludicrous, insulting and opportunistic attempt to exploit the disease for corporate gain by the world’s largest privately-held coal company. As part of a PR offensive to rebrand coal as a “21st-century fuel” that can help solve global poverty, it has emerged that at the height of Ebola’s impact in Africa, Peabody Energy promoted its product as an answer to Africa’s devastating public health crisis. Greg Boyce, the chief executive of Peabody, a US-based multinational with mining interests around the world, included a slide on Ebola and energy in a presentation to a coal industry conference in September last year. The slide suggested that more energy would have spurred the distribution of a hypothetical Ebola vaccine – citing as supporting evidence a University of Pennsylvania infectious disease expert. The World Health Organisation believes nearly 27,000 people contracted Ebola in an outbreak of the virus in West Africa last year, and more than 11,000 died – although the international agency believes that is probably an underestimate.  Public health experts who were involved in fighting the spread of Ebola were outraged at Peabody’s suggestion that expanding energy access with coal generation could have hindered the spread of Ebola and helped with the distribution of a vaccine – especially as there is no approved vaccine against the disease. Meanwhile, the medical expert cited by Peabody to support its claims told the Guardian he had never heard of the company – and that it had got his name wrong. “There is no apparent merit or evidence to support such a thesis,” said Irwin Redlener, director of Columbia University’s National Centre for Disaster Preparedness, and an adviser to the White House on the US response to Ebola. “Peabody has very specific and explicit corporate goals. I think this is a pretty far fetched leap from a global crisis to try to justify the existence of a company that is interested in producing and selling coal.” Redlener added: “I think it’s an opportunistic attempt and somewhat desperate to relate corporate self-interest to a massive public health crisis.” Skip Burkle, a senior fellow of the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative at the university’s school of public health, said Peabody’s claims were “absolutely ludicrous”. “We are talking about public health infrastructure,” he said. “Energy is just one piece of it. There are so many other factors that have to come together.” He went on: “The coal industry is going down but there are other answers to this and it is not to dump it in Africa. It is just an insult to the population.” Peabody denied it was using the Ebola crisis for its own gain. “Mr Boyce was simply noting that a lack of electricity dramatically impaired the ability to fight Ebola in key nations that have little energy access and where hospitals rely on generators for power,” Vic Svec, the company’s senior vice-president for global investor and corporate relations told the Guardian. The doctor whose comments were used to justify Peabody’s claims was relatively sanguine. “I know nothing about the coal industry,” Harvey Rubin, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Pennsylvania said. He did say he intended to contact the company to correct his name – which was wrong on the power point. Boyce had claimed in the power point that electricity shortages had hampered the fight against Ebola. “Lack of electricity impairs ability to fight crises like Ebola,” the headline to Boyce’s powerpoint said. It went on to quote Rubin – misidentified as Harry not Harvey – on the importance to public vaccination efforts of a reliable electricity supply. “Let’s say someone does develop an Ebola vaccine. Distributing a vaccine would require continuous chain refrigeration,” Rubin said. But he told the Guardian he was “agnostic” on the issue of power sources. He said there were already sufficient supplies of electricity in Africa for effective distribution of vaccines by using existing cell phone towers. “We can piggyback on those towers,” he said. The Ebola claims surfaced amid growing pressure on Peabody Energy from the downturn in coal and a global anti-apartheid style fossil fuel divestment campaign.  Over the last two years, over 200 institutions and major investors have committed to selling off their stocks of oil, coal and gas, on the grounds that much of the world’s reserves of fossil fuels must stay in the ground to avoid dangerous climate change. Some institutions – such as Stanford University – have committed only to dumping coal, while hanging on to oil and gas holdings. The Guardian supports the fossil fuel divestment movement, and through its Keep it in the Ground campaign has called on two of the world’s biggest charities, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust to divest from fossil fuels. The Gates Foundations’s Asset Trust has a $1.6m holding in Peabody according to the most recently available information. The Wellcome Trust does not have a direct investment in the company. Peabody views the fossil fuel divestment campaign as “misguided and symbolic”. But in the past it has suggested that divestment could have an impact on the business. “The impact of such efforts [fossil fuel divestment campaigns] may adversely affect the demand for and price of securities issued by us, and impact our access to the capital and financial markets,” wrote Peabody in its 2014 annual filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Svec though, denied that the campaign represented a threat to the company’s bottom line. “Fossil fuels comprise more than 80% of all energy use globally, and these fuels will continue to be with us for centuries.”  But the fossil fuel divestment movement has intensified Peabody’s campaign to rebrand coal. It is the dirtiest of fossil fuels which contributes heavily to climate change and causes large numbers of deaths because of pollution produced when burning it.  But in a power point presentation, prepared for the managers of the world’s richest sovereign wealth fund, the Norwegian government pension fund in June last year, Peabody executives argued that coal was positioned to be the fastest-growing fuel of the 21st century. At the time, the fund had 64m NOK (£5.5m) in Peabody, down from 1.2bn NOK in 2010. In the meeting, Peabody argued that “21st-century coal” was positioned to be the main driver of digital expansion, and of urbanisation of developing countries. It also said access to coal was the cure for global poverty. The effort did not work. As of 31 December, the Norwegian government pension fund had dumped all shares of Peabody and other US coal companies, according to Urgewald, a German NGO which monitors the fossil fuel divestment campaign. “So they were obviously not convinced by Peabody’s presentation,” said Heffa Schuecking, a campaigner for Urgewald."
"The University of Washington will remove direct investments in thermal coal from its $2.8bn (£1.8bn) endowment, following a vote by the board of regents, its governing body. In a statement on Thursday, the board’s chair Bill Ayer said: “The regents take very seriously their responsibility for managing the university’s investment portfolio. It has made divestment decisions only a few times on matters it felt represented important values. That we decided to divest from coal companies today reflects the seriousness of the climate change problem.”  Thermal coal is mainly used in power generation. The decision follows a three year campus campaign. Alex Lenferna, who has lead the effort, said: “The University of Washington’s divestment from thermal coal represents one important step forward towards climate justice.” It’s been a week of ups and downs in the divestment world. Edinburgh University rejected calls for full divestment from fossil fuels on Tuesday, prompting protestors to occupy the finance department. The university has the third largest endowment in the UK.  Graciela Chichilnisky arrives at @EdUniPandP #edunidivest pic.twitter.com/Fh2WafPT4q Libby Brooks, our Scotland correspondent, filed this update on the protest:  The Nobel-prize winner who was the lead author on the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change joined the on-going student occupation at Edinburgh University on Friday. Graciela Chichilnisky, the Argentine American mathematical economist and an authority on climate change, gave her support to the student activists who have been occupying the university’s finance department in protest at Tuesday’s decision by the university court not to divest from fossil fuels. Chichilnisky, who is understood to be visiting the country on a speaking tour, will address the students at around 9am on Friday morning. She has engagements during the day but has insisted that she will return to spend the night with the occupation. This may bring her into conflict with university authorities who yesterday reneged on their agreement to allow open access to the occupation. Asked whether Chichilnisky would be bringing her own sleeping bag, Kirsty Haigh, student campaigner with Edinburgh People and Planet and a member of the occupation laughed: “I hope so because we don’t have many spare!” Activists are protesting outside City Hall in London on Friday after Boris Johnson rejected a motion by the London assembly calling on the institution to divest its pension fund from fossil fuels.

"Energy regulator Ofgem has opened an investigation into five power companies that took part in the government’s first “capacity market” auction designed to keep the lights on at peak demand. Three of the firms have links to Green Frog, a Birmingham-based business which has been involved in a “diesel farm” boom that has angered environmentalists and frustrated politicians.  The watchdog is scrutinising the actions of GF Power Peaking, Berangere and Adret, all of which have Green Frog links, as well as Alkane Energy and Power Balancing Service. The companies obtained contracts of up to 15 years in the December auction to provide extra electricity-generating capacity from 2018 on the basis that they would use existing generation or be building new sites. “Ofgem has opened investigations to see if five generators provided false or misleading information to National Grid about planning consents for some of their proposed generating units that took part in the December 2014 capacity auction,” the regulator said in a statement.  “The opening of these investigations does not imply that we have made any findings about non-compliance,” Ofgem said of the review, which centres on whether planning consents were obtained. Green Frog declined to comment, while Alkane Energy said it “does not believe it is in breach of the Capacity Market Rules and will fully cooperate with Ofgem’s investigation.” Power Balancing Service could not be contacted. The move came as the National Grid warned that the gap between expected power demand and supply would remain “very, very tight” – particularly during the winter after next. Steve Holliday, the chief executive of the National Grid, expressed renewed concerns 24 hours after SSE announced plans to close the 1,000 megawatt power station at Ferrybridge in West Yorkshire next year. SSE’s move was not a total surprise, he said, but it “absolutely does” point up the fact that old coal-fired and nuclear generating capacity was being taken off the system while not enough new generation was being built. Holliday was speaking as the Grid reported an 11% increase in adjusted pretax profits to £2.9bn and said return on equity from the UK regulated business had averaged 13.7%.  He said the latter high figure – compared to 8.4% for the US business – was not to the detriment of energy customers because the Grid was bound to share the benefits with power users under the terms of its agreements with Ofgem. Holliday said the company was using innovation and new technology to drive down the cost of its business, saying robotics, for example, would reduce the number of holes it dug in the ground by 50% between 2013 and 2018. The Grid boss said that further cost-savings to energy users would come from new contracts to import power via interconnector pipelines with mainline Europe. He stressed that being part of the wider European energy market was “essential for the UK”."

"The last intact section of one of Antarctica’s mammoth ice shelves is weakening fast and will likely disintegrate completely in the next few years, contributing further to rising sea levels, according to a Nasa study released on Thursday.  The research focused on a remnant of the so-called Larsen B Ice Shelf, which has existed for at least 10,000 years but partially collapsed in 2002. What is left covers about 625 sq miles (1,600 sq km), about half the size of Rhode Island. Antarctica has dozens of ice shelves – massive, glacier-fed floating platforms of ice that hang over the sea at the edge of the continent’s coast line. The largest is roughly the size of France. Larsen B is located in the Antarctic Peninsula, which extends toward the southern tip of South America and is one of two principal areas of the continent where scientists have documented the thinning of such ice formations.  “This study of the Antarctic Peninsula glaciers provides insights about how ice shelves farther south, which hold much more land ice, will react to a warming climate,” said Eric Rignot, co-author of the study and a glaciologist at Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.  Almost 200 countries have agreed to negotiate a United Nations (UN) pact by the end of 2015 to combat global climate change, which most scientists expect will bring about more flooding, droughts, heat waves and higher seas.  The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has cited a probability of at least 95% that accelerated warming of the planet has been triggered by human activities, led by atmospheric emissions of greenhouse gases from the burning of fossil fuels.  The study, published online in the journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters, was based on airborne surveys and radar data.  The study’s lead scientist, Ala Khazendar, said analysis of the data reveals that a widening rift in Larsen B will eventually break it apart completely, probably around the year 2020.  Once that happens, glaciers held in place by the ice shelf will slip into the ocean at a faster rate and contribute to rising sea levels, scientists say.  The study also found Leppard and Flask, two main tributary glaciers of the ice shelf, have thinned by between 65 and 72 feet (20 to 22 meters) in recent years, and the pace of their shrinking has accelerated since the immediate aftermath of the 2002 partial collapse of the ice shelf.

"Lord Puttnam, the Oscar-winning producer behind some of the most successful British films of the 1970s and 80s, including Chariots of Fire and Bugsy Malone, is to return to movie-making after a substantial gap, with a film about the Arctic 30, a group of environmental activists seized by Russian troops last year. Speaking in Cannes, David Puttnam, 74, said that, despite a long career as an environmental activist, as well as chairing the committee which oversaw the 2005 climate change bill, he had become increasingly convinced the best way for him to influence thinking was through cinema. “I’m quite elderly,” he said. “There’s only going to be one more movie. [But] reluctantly, and rather late in life, I’ve had to come to terms with the fact that the only professional tool I have at my disposal is that of a one-time producer.” Along with collaborators including the writer and actor Emma Thompson and producer Hani Farsi, Puttnam will oversee the adaptation of Greenpeace press officer Ben Stewart’s account of the Arctic 30 incident, entitled Don’t Trust, Don’t Fear, Don’t Beg. That book takes its title from advice given to the group by fellow prisoners at the Murmansk detention centre, where they were held on charges of piracy. In September 2013, 30 men and women travelled to the Arctic to attach a pod to a floating rig to prevent the extraction of oil. Before they could do so, their boat was boarded from the air by Russian troops and towed to Murmansk. The group were freed after two months in jail, as the Kremlin came under increasing international pressure ahead of the Sochi Winter Olympics. That politicians and lobbyists had proved unable to galvanise the public about impending ecological catastrophe was, Puttnam said, “a little” disillusioning.  “The left has failed to conquer the language of conservation,” he said. “Weirdly, historically, it was always been the right who have led the charge.” He hopes cinema might manage to make the connection. “Its job is to turn complex arguments into relatively simple human relationships,” he said. “You begin to feel the things that otherwise you’re forced to think.” The trick to battling apathy, said Puttnam, was to try to bypass biology. “Human beings are a little bit like boiled frogs. We are attuned to reacting magnificently to immediate disaster. But we’re terrible at long-term problems,” he said. Arctic 30 will aim to avoid polemic and excite a younger generation about the potential of political protest. “My grandchildren are funny and lovely, but the idea that someone of their generation would sacrifice something is sort of unthinkable to them,” Puttnam said. “It’s not part of the frame of reference. My idea is that my granddaughters would walk out of the premiere saying: ‘Gramps, Jesus! What can I do to help?’ That’s my dream.” The exact nature of Thompson’s involvement in the project has yet to be determined, but the writer and actor – who travelled to the Arctic with Greenpeace last year – is, according to Puttnam, eager to flag that “the hero of the film is the integrity of the Arctic itself”. Puttnam and Farsi declare themselves unconcerned about any possible Kremlin backlash to the film, which they say will be at pains to point out two of the 30 were Russian. And with the announcement by Shell last Monday that it is to resume gas and oil drilling in the Arctic, they sense a “new villain” on the horizon. “It’s not just Russia,” says Farsi. “By the time the film is released, we’re going to shame everybody.”  Only a smattering of fiction films have tackled environmental matters in the past. Puttnam highlights Christopher Nolan’s 2014 sci-fi epic Interstellar, which offered a vision of a world in which the Earth has to be abandoned, as perhaps the most ambitious to date. However, the words “climate change” are not spoken in the film, something Puttnam suspects was down to studio encouragement: “That’s a turn-off.” The success of Nolan’s film, which took £428m globally, also points to a worsening hypocrisy in the British film industry, thinks Puttnam, who is currently chair of the Film Distributors’ Association. Films such as Interstellar and Matthew Vaughn’s Kingsman: The Secret Service prop up the box office but their directors rarely join the likes of Mike Leigh and Ken Loach on the lists of the most respected. “The industry pretends to be one of a different type of cultural dignity and integrity,” he said. Of the 1,641 films released in Europe last year – about four times the number made when Puttnam was first producing – only 41 took a profit. “More and more films making less and less money,” he said. “And yet some films making more money than God.” Such a situation, said Puttnam, resulted in a “cultural hypocrisy” unique to the film industry, which, he points out, prefers to declare its gross, including VAT, rather than post-tax profits.  “We’re our own worst enemies. Because we need to get enthusiasm and convince ourselves it’s a hugely successful business we shout numbers that are actually not real.”"
"Unesco will release a draft ruling on whether to list the Great Barrier Reef as in danger early on Saturday morning in a critical moment for Australia’s stewardship of the world’s largest coral reef. The recommendations will inform a final decision by the UN’s world heritage committee next month, which, if in favour of declaring the reef in danger, would herald a new era of outside scrutiny of its care.  Federal and state ministers are reportedly confident that the scale of their investments and legislation to tackle reef threats – as well as an unprecedented lobbying effort by the Abbott government – will be enough to spare them the embarrassment of a listing. A listing, which would place the reef in the same category as the polluted Everglades national park in the US, would usher in yearly checks by the UN and would likely cause a jolt to a tourism industry worth $6bn. Environmentalists say that regardless of Australia’s ability to sway Unesco, the reef remains imperilled, with its health in long-term decline and threats increasing. Greenpeace political advisor Jessica Panegyres said that the decline meant Unesco was unlikely to give the reef the “clean bill of health” Australian governments were seeking. That scenario would see a listing ruled out and a UN check not due for another five years. Panegyres said another possible outcome was Unesco refraining from a listing this time but threatening to impose one if it found evidence of a decline in another two to five years. Australia’s Reef 2050 Long-Term Sustainability Plan sets targets to cut pollution running on to the reef, including an 80% reduction in nitrogen and a 50% cut in sediment by 2025. The plan was updated months ago to include policies from the new Queensland Labor government which environmental groups welcomed, including a promise to ban the dumping of capital dredged sediment in the reef world heritage area and give $100m over five years to lift water quality. The federal government is banning dumping in the reef’s marine park and giving a further $100m in funding for the Reef Trust, a body that will work with landowners to stop chemicals flowing into the coral ecosystem. A new independent scientific panel, headed by the chief government scientist Ian Chubb, will oversee the trust’s work. Australia’s plan has been accompanied by a vigorous lobbying effort, including among the country’s Asian neighbours. The Queensland government will send its key political performer – deputy premier Jackie Trad – along with environment minister Steven Miles, to join the federal environment minister Greg Hunt in Bonn for the world heritage committee deliberations from 28 June. The draft decision, which Panegyres said would likely form the basis of the final ruling unless it was perceived as particularly “soft or controversial”, will be released in Paris at 1am AEST on Saturday.  Panegyres said, regardless of the outcome, it was Greenpeace’s position that the reef was genuinely in danger, with a 50% loss of coral cover over 30 years among the key measures showing it was in continuous decline. The government’s own outlook report identified that half of the identified measures of world heritage values, from dugongs to threatened species habitats, were in decline. Meanwhile, the trajectory of the impacts was increasing, including the reef’s most serious long-term threat, climate change. Respected coral reef researchers Terry Hughes and Jon Day of James Cook university have said that the opening of new coal mines – a reference to plans for central Queensland’s Galilee basin – are “too risky” for the reef. However, both state and federal governments remain supportive of proposals by mining corporations to open massive new mines in the Galilee, which would increase shipping traffic through reef waters and industrial activity on the coast through port expansion. Panegyres said while the Queensland government gained kudos through some of its dredge-dumping bans and its water quality investments, it “wanted to have its cake and eat it too” through its support of new mines. Hughes and Day have also called for even tighter restrictions on dredging, with dumping of spoil still allowed in the reef’s world heritage area if it is from “maintenance” dredging. Panegyres said potentially “disastrous” dredging in existing port areas like Gladstone was still allowed. “The point is the reef is on a knife edge, it’s in a critical state, so why are we subjecting it to more harm, particularly when that exact harm will also drive climate change, which is the greatest long-term threat to the reef,” she said."

"Most of the glaciers in the Mount Everest region will disappear or drastically retreat as temperatures increase with climate change over the next century, according to a group of international researchers. The estimated 5,500 glaciers in the Hindu Kush-Himalayan (HKH) region – site of Mount Everest and many of the world’s tallest peaks – could reduce their volume by 70%-99% by 2100, with dire consequences for farming and hydropower generation downstream, they said.  “The signal of future glacier change in the region is clear: continued and possibly accelerated mass loss from glaciers is likely, given the projected increase in temperatures,” said Joseph Shea, a glacier hydrologist at the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development in Nepal, and leader of the study published in The Cryosphere, the journal of the European Geosciences Union (EGU).  The team studied glaciers in the Dudh Kosi basin in the Nepal Himalaya, which is home to some of the world’s highest mountain peaks, including Mount Everest, and to over 400 sq km of glacier area. They concluded that the lower glaciers will melt fastest because the freezing level – the elevation where mean monthly temperatures are 0C – will rise higher up the mountains as air temperatures rise.  “The freezing level currently varies between 3,200 metres in January and 5,500 metres in August. Based on historical temperature measurements and projected warming to the year 2100, this could increase by 800–1,200 meters,” said study co-author Walter Immerzeel of Utrecht University in the Netherlands. “Such an increase would not only reduce snow accumulations over the glaciers, but would also expose over 90% of the current glacierised area to melt in the warmer months,” said the authors. There is still much uncertainty about how deeply levels of greenhouse gases will affect temperature, snowfall and rainfall, and very few of the region’s glaciers have been measured in detail. However, increasing rates of snow and ice melt are already observable and precipitation is expected to change from snow to rain at critical elevations, where glaciers are concentrated.  Farming and hydropower generation downstream of the Himalayan peaks is likely to be greatly affected. Over one billion people in Asia depend on rivers fed by glaciers for their food and livelihoods. While increased glacier melt initially increases water flows, ongoing retreat leads to reduced meltwater from the glaciers during the warmer months.  Glacier retreat, say the authors, can also result in the creation and growth of lakes dammed by glacial debris. Avalanches and earthquakes, similar to the one that devastated Everest base camp earlier this month, can breach the dams, causing catastrophic floods, says the paper. The researchers caution that the new results should be seen as a first approximation to how Himalayan glaciers will react to increasing temperatures in the region.  “Our estimates need to be taken very cautiously, as considerable uncertainties remain,” said Patrick Wagnon, a glaciologist at the Institut de Recherche pour le Développement in Grenoble, France and co-author of the report. A 2013 study, by a team led by a Nepali scientist at the University of Milan, found that some glaciers on or around Mount Everest had shrunk by 13% in the last 50 years with the snow line 180 metres higher than it was 50 years ago. The glaciers are disappearing faster every year, it said, with some smaller glaciers now only half the size they were in the 1960s. The projected speed of glacier melt in the Himalayas has been disputed since the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) erroneously reported non-peer reviewed science in 2009 which suggested that glaciers there were likely to disappear altogether by 2035. The IPCC confirmed that the paragraph should not have been included in the report and published an apology. "
"The biggest issue in conservation – bigger than any mining project, power plant or climate plan – is diversity. The environmental movement needs to start looking like modern America. To continue our proud American legacy of protecting our environment, we need to adapt. A recent report released by Green 2.0 highlights the environmental movement’s disconcerting lack of diversity. Unconscious bias, inadequate recruitment and poor retention all stand in the way of a more diverse environmental movement. People of color make up 36% of the US population and comprise 29% of the science and engineering workforce, but the report found that only about 12% of staff at the mainstream environmental advocacy groups and foundations that fund them are people of color. A separate report by the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy found that while environmental funders spent $10bn between 2000 and 2009, just 15% of those dollars benefited poor and under-served communities. The problem is just as serious at the top levels of environmental organizations. While 22.5% of interns at environmental organizations are people of color, only 12% of leadership positions and 4.6% of board positions are held by people of color. With some notable exceptions – such as Aaron Mair’s recent appointment as The Sierra Club’s first African-American national president – you see less diversity the further up the organizational chart you go. This failure comes despite the disproportionate impact of environmental hazards on communities of color and the fact that  people of color support executive action on climate change more strongly than white Americans.  If environmental advocacy doesn’t start representing the country we live in – a country where Asian and Latino families are the fastest growing populations and where California is already majority non-white – everything we’ve worked for is at risk. Even if general public awareness of environmental issues is higher today than it was 50 or 100 years ago, the momentum we’re seeing today could evaporate if we don’t include new partners in the coalition. We’ll never get climate legislation if Congress thinks only “environmentalists” – in most minds, a relatively small slice of white liberal America – truly care about the issue. Nor will we get greater protection for endangered species, stronger air quality standards or limits on chemicals other countries already consider dangerous. Without a more diverse environmental movement, I’d question whether we’ll see any major policy advances in the coming decade at all.  Since becoming ranking member of the House Natural Resources Committee, I’ve held a series of roundtables and public events, from Washington to California, to bring together community and national leaders who aren’t normally included in the environmental conversation, including women, Latinos and local residents impacted by major decisions. They frequently expressed concern – and confusion – that their voices were being ignored by people claiming to speak for the environmental movement. At one of the public events we organized in Los Angeles, Andrew Yip, the Program Coordinator for an organization that promotes cycling in the San Gabriel Valley, made an excellent point: “Do we expect a new generation of environmental stewards to reflect this diversity? Do we expect all fourth graders to grow up wanting to be conservationists? These expectations will fall short if we do not engage communities of color, especially youth of color, now. Our conservation movements and environmental organizations must tackle the issue of environmental justice head-on. They need to reflect the diversity that is embedded in Los Angeles, and the inequalities and inequities that still exist today.” This outreach effort is about building a sustainable environmental movement for the long haul. If lawmakers think you’re only speaking for a small, unrepresentative minority, they won’t let you shape policy. Both major political parties understand that they can’t survive without the support of communities of color. For some reason, not enough of the environmental world has gotten the message. "

"A man of Ben van Beurden’s power and reputation for blunt speaking is capable of silencing a ballroom packed with his boisterous peers. When the chief executive of Shell rose to address an industry gathering in a London hotel, a respectful hush descended. Van Beurden, 57, rose from a modest background in the Netherlands to the top of a cut-throat, politically fraught sector that rarely finds itself out of the public firing line. The annual black-tie dinner at International Petroleum Week in February, a typical nexus of senior executives and high-ranking government officials, was expecting a frank assessment of its response to its biggest challenge: global warming. Van Beurden did not disappoint. Warning the room that the industry had a credibility problem, that it was “aloof” when it came to issues like climate change, he said: “You cannot talk credibly about lowering emissions globally if, for example, you are slow to acknowledge climate change, if you undermine calls for an effective carbon price, and if you always descend into the ‘jobs versus environment’ argument in the public debate.” That speech was a far cry from the usual backslapping fare at the annual event and it put some noses out of joint. But it was welcomed by those who knew that Van Beurden was no fluffy liberal. “Follow the money,” was his mantra during a stint at Shell’s chemicals division, according to one colleague. Now, his message to the industry was: follow the overwhelming evidence on greenhouse gas emissions and join the debate on climate change, or risk the fossil fuel industry being sidelined. But Shell’s own business model, and in particular a career-defining takeover executed by Van Beurden within two months of that industry broadside, points to a different corporate philosophy. The powerful ranks of oil and gas industry executives had not witnessed a Damascene moment. Shell, under Van Beurden, is pursuing a strategy that seems to leave the €130bn (£94bn) Anglo-Dutch group firmly among the unconverted when it comes to stopping runaway climate change. An investigation into the Shell business shows that under its forecasts the Earth’s temperature will rise nearly twice as much as the 2C threshold for dangerous climate change, and that the firm’s own greenhouse gas emissions are still rising and will rocket further after the £47bn acquisition of rival BG Group. Further, Shell’s Canadian tar sands, Brazilian, Nigerian and US Gulf deep-water projects are the most likely to be rendered worthless by a global clampdown on high carbon-emitting exploration projects, analyses find. In addition, the company’s growth is becoming reliant on drilling wells (some deeper than the one that caused BP’s Gulf blowout) and it is a member of the American Legislative Exchange Council, a political organisation that has opposed policies to address climate change. A stark counterpoint to Van Beurden’s speech comes from a 2013 Shell New Lens Scenario planning document which suggests industry talk of lowering global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is just that. Referring to the internationally agreed limit on a global temperature rise of 2C, the document states: “Both our scenarios and the IEA (International Energy Agency) New Policies scenario (and our base case energy demand and outlook) do not limit emissions to be consistent with the back-calculated 450 parts per million (CO2 in the atmosphere) 2C. We also do not see governments taking the steps now that are consistent with the 2C scenario.” According to one estimate, that Shell statement is tantamount to acknowledging that the world will disastrously vault over the 2C limit. Charlie Kronick, climate campaigner at Greenpeace, estimates that the IEA middle New Policies scenario cited by Shell leaves the Earth facing a temperature increase of 3.7C as fossil fuels continue to be burned. Shell strategy = catastrophic climate change. Do @wellcometrust @gatesfoundation want that? http://t.co/YtXfPcnQf4 #keepitintheground Work by international scientists has warned that a 4C rise in the planet’s temperature would bring severe droughts globally and millions of migrants seeking refuge as food supplies collapse. Desertification of parts of the globe would force agriculture on to untouched areas of the planet, while populations would have to adapt to rising sea levels, extreme weather and increasing levels of agricultural pests and diseases, according to a collection of papers published by the Royal Society in 2010. Meanwhile, a recent, seismic corporate event put even greater distance between Van Beurden’s words and reality. On 8 April Shell’s chief executive shocked the industry by announcing the acquisition of BG Group, the former exploration arm of British Gas, now one of the world’s biggest gas producers. Having warned industry colleagues about the discredited trade-off between jobs and the environment, Van Beurden put growth first in emphatic fashion. The BG deal is the biggest takeover in the company’s history and it clearly propels Shell deeper into fossil fuel extraction. Putting the two businesses together makes a growing carbon footprint even bigger. Shell’s direct greenhouse gas emissions from facilities were 76m tonnes on a CO2-equivalent basis in 2014, up 4% from 73m tonnes 12 months earlier. Operations directly under BG’s control in 2014 emitted 7.6m tonnes of greenhouse gases, an increase of about 600,000 tonnes, or 9%, on 2013. If regulators let the new partnership proceed, Shell will be increasing its oil and gas reserves by 25%, raising production by 20% and employing almost 100,000 staff. This would be a big boost given that Shell, which in its early incarnation nearly a century ago boasted of producing 11% of the world’s oil, has struggled to find its own oil and gas reserves through the drill bit. Fadel Gheit, the highly respectedindustry analyst, described the transaction as “one of the best deals the industry has ever seen”. But Pascal Menges, manager of the Lombard Odier Global Energy Fund, which invests in the energy sector, sees failure as the driving motive behind the deal. “This shows that big oil’s growth strategy over the last 10 years is bust,” he argued. “Having bet enormous sums on eye-wateringly expensive oil production from oil sands, ultra-deep water and Arctic fields, the super majors are now ill-placed to cope with a low oil price,” he said, although oil had recently recovered from a perilous low of less than $50 per barrel this year – a price which makes profitable oil and gas exploration very difficult – to around $65. Menges also highlighted a trend pushing Shell into exploring difficult parts of the world – such as the Canadian tar sands, Nigeria, and deep water off Brazil and the US Gulf (underlined by the US government’s controversial decision on 11 May to allow Shell to restart drilling in the Arctic, off the coast of Alaska). Shell has either taken most accessible oil and gas fields or had its path blocked by states engaged in resource nationalism – governments giving licences to state-owned companies at the expense of foreign multinationals. Shell is upfront that its takeover of BG is about profit and capability. A spokeswoman said: “By combining BG’s portfolio and skills set with Shell’s capabilities we can deliver a step change in the growth priorities for both of our companies. This means more deep water and more LNG [liquefied natural gas] plays where we have strong profitability and capabilities.” This retreat to some of the most inaccessible and technically challenging oil and gas fields in the world poses, however, a further threat to Shell: the possibility of these projects being forcibly mothballed if there is global action to head off a rise of more than 2C. Research from Carbon Tracker, a climate change thinktank, highlights all these areas – the Canadian tar sands, the US Gulf and Alaska – as being at the highest risk from enforced mothballing and becoming “stranded assets” tying up billions of pounds worth of shareholder funds. This analysis was given further weight by a study for the Norwegian government by the industry consultancy Rystad Energy. It concluded that even if the world managed to remain within the 2C limit the “largest stranded areas are offshore North and South America, west Africa and in the Arctic”. The BG Group deal gives Shell a significant stake in one of the most technically challenging – not to mention potentially stranded – deep water projects in the world. In the previous decade Brazil made a mammoth oil discovery off its Atlantic coast and Shell inherited BG’s investments in those fields. The fields off Brazil are at depths of 2,100 metres (7,000 ft) compared with the 1,500 metres that BP was operating in when its Deepwater Horizon rig blew up in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 during a drilling operation. Deep water is expensive to operate in and, as BP found out, an environment where the consequences of serious accidents are harder to manage. But Van Beurden rejects the stranded asset argument for Shell. In a speech to Columbia University, in New York, last September, he said: “In our opinion, the ‘stranded assets’ thesis underestimates the significance of rising energy demand. It underplays the role natural gas will perform in the global energy system, especially in replacing coal power plants. And it ignores the potential of innovations like carbon capture and storage.” With Shell’s involvement in such controversial areas there is also scrutiny of its lobbying efforts. The Union of Concerned Scientists in the US has started a campaign against Shell over its continued involvement in the American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec), a rightwing nonprofit organisation that has been criticised for drafting model legislation that denies any human contribution to climate change. While companies such as Occidental Petroleum and Google have left Alec – Google’s executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, alleged last year “they’re just literally lying” about climate change – Shell argues that it supports the organisation because it promotes job creation and the free market. In a statement, it said: “We are members of Alec and several other similar groups across the political spectrum that foster bipartisan exchanges between elected officials. In terms of Alec, we specifically support their pro-growth, pro-jobs agenda and generally find commonality on issues important to the oil and gas industry. “While there are some issues on which we have different views, we look at the totality of the organisation not a single issue. This is the case with other organisations as well.” Some critics say the “responsible image” of Shell moving into a cleaner gas sector via the BG deal masks a fossil fuel company struggling for survival in a world facing climate change. “This is not an evil guy leading the world to destruction. He is just leading a company that is trying to find a way of maintaining this [fossil fuels] system,” said Ike Teuling, energy campaigner with Friends of the Earth Netherlands. Fittingly for a pragmatic Dutchman, There is considerable latitude in Van Beurden’s stance on climate change. He argues that global warming is a significant issue that needs tackling but not in a way that distracts attention away from the reality of growing population, increasing prosperity and growing energy demand. “Today, three billion people still lack access to the modern energy many of us take for granted,” he said. “This isn’t just about having a dustbuster or a TV set. Energy access often makes the difference between poverty and prosperity. At the same time, demand is growing. There will be more people on this planet, more people living in cities and more people rising from poverty. They will all need energy if they are to thrive. The issue is how to balance one moral obligation, energy access for all, against the other: fighting climate change.”. This allows Van Beurden to indicate that fossil fuel critics are largely based in the largely prosperous west and are denying prosperity to those developing countries such as China and India who need oil and gas energy to become more prosperous themselves. Included in Van Beurden’s industry speech in that hotel ballroom there were excerpts that endorsed the status quo. “Yes, climate change is real. And yes, renewables are an indispensable part of the future energy mix. But no, provoking a sudden death of fossil fuels isn’t a plausible plan,” he suggested. Nothing in Shell’s current strategy suggests Van Beurden is going to present a plausible alternative."
"US Congress periodically holds hearings on issues related to climate change. Because the subject has become a partisan one in America, they generally follow a predictable pattern – Democrats invite science and policy expert witnesses who agree with the expert consensus on human-caused global warming and the need to address it, and Republicans invite witnesses who disagree. John Christy at the University of Alabama at Huntsville is one of the fewer than 3% of climate scientists who publishes research suggesting that humans aren’t the primary cause of the current global warming. He’s thus become one of Republicans’ favorite expert witnesses.  Last week, the Committee on Natural Resources held a hearing to discuss draft guidance by the the President’s Council on Environmental Quality to include carbon pollution and the effects of climate change in the consideration of environmental impacts of federal projects, as part of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review process. Needless to say, the Republicans on the committee don’t like the idea, as is clear from the hearing highlights and lowlights in the video below. Given that the hearing was ostensibly about environmental policy, most of the witnesses were policy experts. John Christy was the lone climate scientist invited to testify. His testimony focused on manufacturing doubt about the accuracy of climate models, climate change impacts, and about individual American projects’ contributions to global warming. On the accuracy of climate models, Christy played rather fast and loose with the facts, saying in his written testimony (emphasis added), Do we understand how greenhouse gases affect the climate, i.e. the link between emissions and climate effects? A very basic metric for climate studies is the temperature of the bulk atmospheric layer known as the troposphere, roughly from the surface to 50,000 ft altitude. This is the layer that, according to models, should warm significantly as CO2 increases ...  I was able to access 102 CMIP-5 rcp4.5 (representative concentration pathways) climate model simulations of the atmospheric temperatures for the tropospheric layer and generate bulk temperatures from the models for an apples-to-apples comparison with the observations from satellites and balloons ... On average the models warm the global atmosphere at a rate three times that of the real world ... As such, they would be of highly questionable value in determining policy that should depend on a very confident understanding of how the climate system works.  Christy’s oral testimony referred only to the temperatures of the “atmosphere” and “planet.” As shown in the above quote, in his written testimony, Christy twice referenced the troposphere – the lowest layer of the atmosphere from the surface to 50,000 feet (15km) in altitude. However, to argue that climate models have been inaccurate, Christy showed a graph of only mid-troposphere temperatures. The mid-troposphere is the atmospheric layer from about 25,000–50,000 feet, or about 8–15km in altitude.   One might reasonably ask why Christy only showed data for such high altitudes. For perspective, the highest point on the Earth’s surface is on Mount Everest at 29,000 feet (8.8km), and the highest elevation city in the world is La Rinconada, Peru at 16,700 feet (5.1km). Humans live in the lower troposphere, not the mid-troposphere. As weather balloon data show, the mid-troposphere is warming significantly more slowly than the lower troposphere, where the increasing greenhouse effect has more of an impact on temperature changes. It’s possible that climate models aren’t quite getting the vertical profile of atmospheric temperature changes quite right. It’s also possible that the measurements themselves aren’t accurate – different scientific groups have significantly different estimates of the rates of warming in the low and mid-troposphere. Some combination of both is undoubtedly true. However, climate models have done a good job matching the observed temperature change at the surface and in the lower troposphere, where humans live. We understand the workings of the Earth’s climate much better than Christy suggests, especially where it matters most to humans. This is a key focus of my book and one of my Denial101x course lectures. For further detail on how climate models are built, see this Denial101x interview with expert climate modelers. Toward the end of the video, Professor Andrew Pitman provides this quote that John Christy and Republicans in Congress would do well to learn from. Christy also suggested that Americans have not yet experienced increases in various extreme climate impacts such as heat waves. This is a particularly strange example, given that Christy doesn’t deny that temperatures have risen significantly, and an increase in heat waves is an obvious consequence of rising temperatures. There is indeed a large body of scientific literature showing that heatwaves and other types of extreme weather are becoming more frequent and intense due to human-caused global warming. Christy also claimed that carbon emissions from any single federal project will have a negligible impact on climate change; an extremely flawed argument. If I dump a bucket of motor oil into a nearby river, it will have a negligible environmental impact. Should we then allow everyone to dump their used oil into rivers without regulation? It’s cumulative national and global carbon emissions that matter, and every source of emissions should be appropriately considered. The expert consensus on human-caused global warming was discussed several times during the hearing. Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) asked of Christy,  You ever feel like Galileo? You remember Galileo? The overwhelming amount of science was against Galileo, and the other side of this got money from the Church, they got money from the government from their research opposing Galileo, and yet Galileo was right.  This is of course incorrect – the scientific evidence was on Galileo’s side, although it’s correct to note that the climate science evidence is overwhelmingly against Christy. Christy himself has tried to have it both ways on consensus, previously having claimed to be part of the 97% (he’s not), and in the hearing claiming in response to a question about a NASA statement on the on the consensus, I would hope I could disabuse you of that 97% number. That’s been debunked by several studies ... remember, the NASA website is controlled by a specific government. This claim is false. Two poor responses to our 97% consensus paper were published in off-topic journals and were themselves debunked. This was also an ironic choice of words by Christy. As documented in The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars, Christy previously wrote a letter of complaint to the president of Michael Mann’s university after Mann correctly noted in Senate testimony that the myth that Christy’s satellite data contradicted surface temperature data had been debunked.  My colleagues and I have thick skins and won’t be writing to the president of Christy’s university, but he’s once again confused about just what has been debunked. Rep John Fleming (R-VA) and Christy discussed that mass extinctions and mega-droughts have occurred naturally in the past – the ‘climate has changed before’ logical fallacy. To take comfort in the fact that climate change has led to mass extinctions and mega-droughts, while we’re in the midst of a rapid human-caused climate change, is utterly misguided. These are the sorts of dangerous consequences we’re trying to avoid triggering. There’s recently been a debate about whether we can still keep global warming below the 2°C “danger limit.” Most agree that we have all the technology we need to do it relatively cheaply, and we still have time, but what’s lacking is the political will. When Congressional climate hearings focus on science denial and manufacturing doubt in order to delay needed policies, that’s exactly the sort of political failing that may prevent us from solving this problem. It’s important to remember that most Republicans accept the reality of human-caused global warming and support taking action to solve the problem (especially if the solution is revenue neutral) – just none of the Republicans in Congress, yet. Congressman Jared Huffman (D-CA) summarized the problem nicely, Multiple studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals agree [on human-caused global warming]. That’s a very different proposition than what we heard today, that human emissions of greenhouse gases are contributing to climate change and global warming, so I want to congratulate the majority [Republicans] for finding a scientist with this unique contrarian view. I suppose if we look hard enough we could find a cardiologist who would tell us that chocolate cake is good for us. But when there’s such an overwhelming scientific consensus, you know, just a thought that we might want to hear scientific testimony that reflects that."

"Environmentalists are demanding that the EU close a research fund which they claim offers coal companies tens of millions of pounds of public money in grants. The European commission’s Research Fund for Coal and Steel (RFCS) has awarded €144m (£107m) to companies such as E.On UK, RWE Npower and UK Coal Production Ltd, according to research by Greenpeace Energydesk.  Most of the the money is spent on mining infrastructure, management and unconventional use of deposits, and on coal preparation and upgrading. Doug Parr, Greenpeace’s chief scientist, said that the fund made little environmental, economic or scientific sense. “If big energy companies want to waste money on this kind of research, they should waste their own,” he told the Guardian. “The EU should shut down this slush fund for the coal industry and use this money to foster innovation in the clean and smart technologies that will have to power our 21st-century low-carbon economy.”  A commission spokesperson said that around €13m was given to the RFCS each year, and that the revenues should be considered “EU contributions” rather than public funds. The monies could provide up to 60% of costs for research projects, and half of pilot projects, the spokesperson added.  Industry associations say that the fund is a trust that was mostly raised from its members before the European Coal and Steel Community was wound up in 2002.  “The funding is not ‘public’ [money] because the source of the money was a levy on the coal and steel industries. The commission administers the programme on behalf of member states,” said Brian Ricketts, the secretary-general of Euracoal. “Given that 28% of electricity in EU comes from coal, it is not unreasonable to try to reduce emissions from that coal use,” he added.  The EU is committed to reducing its carbon emissions 40% by 2030 on 1990 levels and funding for coal projects would seem to undermine this. But almost half of the fund’s projects are for technologies that aim to reduce coal emissions, with 40% of the budget spent on ‘clean coal’ and carbon capture and storage technology.  Darek Urbaniak, the energy policy officer for WWF Europe, said: “Clean coal is an oxymoron the industry likes to use but it doesn’t actually exist. The technology has never been implemented on an industrial scale. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) was quite clear in its ruling last year that it was misleading for coal firms to use the phrase.” The UK advertising watchdog ruled that ‘clean coal’ was an inaccurate term, because it implied that such coal did not produce CO2, or other emissions. A leaked statement to be issued by EU heads of state at a summit in June, seen by the Guardian, calls for member countries to encourage clean coal initiatives and technologies such as CCS as a means to completing the internal energy market. Poland and the UK were prime movers in sculpting the text. In drafts also obtained by the Guardian, the UK successfully proposed that “indigenous resources” – code for shale gas and coal – be recognised as key drivers of energy security, instead of renewables. Britain also pushed for three positive references to “renewable energies” to be deleted from the statement. The RFCS monies pale in comparison to the €10.1bn of subsidies that European countries gave to the coal industry in 2012 – the same amount as went to onshore wind, according to an Ecofys study for the European commission. Until this year, the commission had used its annual country-specific recommendations to call on states to reform their fossil fuel subsidies regimes. Such a call was for the first time absent from the ‘streamlined’ recommendations published on 13 May.  Europe is currently the world’s biggest producer of lignite, the world’s dirtiest coal, and the third-largest importer of the fossil fuel. "

"Shell has been caught in an embarrassing spat over its plan for a $50,000 (£31,727) video competition aimed at 18-34-year-olds to promote its view that the world still needs fossil fuels despite climate change. The film project is being developed in partnership with US-based online ad agency Zooppa, and, according to a leaked email, was to be pitched at platforms such as Vice, the online news service. An email between Zooppa staff discussing the Shell brief makes it clear “you should NOT mention on your storyboard Arctic Oil”. Environmentalists say Shell’s involvement in exploiting reserves in the Arctic undermines its attempt to portray itself as a responsible oil and gas company keen to tackle global warming. While references to the Arctic are ruled out, the memo says “you can mention instead oil, gas, wind, nuclear energy”. Greenpeace – which received the leaked email – believes the competition is being run in a bid to influence younger people in the runup to critical climate change talks convened by the United Nations in Paris in December. The email appears to be written by one Zooppa staffer to another giving advice about how to approach the project after “I met on Monday with the Shell team”. While the Anglo-Dutch group has insisted it needs to drill off Alaska this summer as part of an effort to see whether it can find oil and replenish the world’s reserves, the email suggests Shell realises its operations in the Chukchi Sea could lose it support.  A Shell spokesman said: “We said in our brief that we wanted to get these films noticed by Vice, but we didn’t expect it to happen this way. At no point was any direction given by Shell to our agency to advise entrants against mentioning the Arctic in their films. We’ve taken the agency outside and given it a stern talking to, and it is now absolutely clear on this.   “Anyway, there’s no censorship, no boundaries other than the pretty basic ones set out in the brief, just a strong desire to get people thinking creatively about how to challenge preconceptions that fossil fuels, especially natural gas, have no part in our future energy lives, and how to communicate the reality of the future energy system. That system will include renewables, nuclear power and oil and gas, including from the Arctic, which is already a major source of energy.” Zooppa declined to comment."

"For the oil multinational BP, it was a historic moment – the signing of a joint venture to exploit the vast oil and gas reserves of Russia’s Arctic shelf with the Russian energy giant Rosneft. The deal was worth £10bn in share swaps.  The chief executive of Rosneft, Igor Sechin – then Russian deputy prime minister, key Putin ally and one of the most forbidding characters in the world of oil – would be coming to London to seal the agreement. Rosneft is majority owned by the Russian state, and BP urgently needed a senior British government figure to mark the alliance. So, the night before the signing in January 2011, BP’s managing director Iain Conn picked up the phone to the then secretary of state for energy and climate change, Chris Huhne. It was awkward, for Huhne had a long-standing engagement – to give a speech at a Liberal Democrat dinner on the Isle of Wight to an audience that would include key representatives of the island’s renewable energy industry. There was, though, only ever going to be one winner. Despite any doubts Huhne, a champion of a low-carbon economy, may have held, he agreed to be there, alongside Sechin, the former KGB officer variously dubbed ‘the scariest man on earth’ and ‘Darth Vadar’. Officials had quickly prepared briefings for Huhne, which discussed the “environmental sensitivities” about risky – and carbon costly – deep water drilling in the Arctic. If pressed on why he was “publicly blessing” the company behind one of the world’s worst environmental disasters, Huhne was simply to say: “Russia is a valuable energy partner for the UK and a deal of this scale is a major development for the energy industry in both countries.” But it was instead Russia’s contribution to “fuelling Europe” in coming decades rather than fears over climate change that officials emphasised.   It helped that Conn and other senior BP executives had been in to visit Huhne just a couple of days earlier to discuss BP’s interests. They had talked through the company’s $20bn (£13bn) exposure to its Deepwater Horizon oil spill disaster in the Gulf of Mexico.  Although the government viewed the financial hit as BP’s problem, it was worried the oil giant’s vast bill for the Gulf accident would hit many UK pension-holders, according to Tom Burke, former BP employee, now chairman of the environmental organisation E3G and advisor to Shell, Rio Tinto and Unilever. About 1.5% of UK pension industry money was invested in BP shares, which had plummeted. And BP had scrapped its dividend payments.  “Around 7% of UK pension fund annual income came from BP at the time. A further 12% came from Shell, so nearly one-fifth of pension funds were intricately linked to the profits of these two oil and gas companies,” explained Burke.    At that meeting, BP was assured by the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) that it would do what it could, with lawyers from the Treasury, the Foreign Office and the business department, to find “an operational solution” to allow BP to reopen the major North Sea gas field it owned jointly with Iran despite the EU’s sanction regime against that country.  The solution, a couple of years later, would be for Iran’s share of the profits to be held by the British government in a frozen account.  These extraordinary insights into the extreme closeness between the British government and one of its biggest companies came to light after a Freedom of Information (FoI) request. Nobody, perhaps, should be much surprised by it. After all, they have shared mutual interests since the first British involvement in commercial oil exploration in the Gulf over 100 years ago. British governments realised that this company could fuel its economy and its war effort. By switching the Navy to running on BP’s oil, Winston Churchill helped ensure the survival of the struggling business that had begun life drilling speculatively in Persia as the First Exploitation Company. He then insisted on controlling this vital resource, and, in 1914, the government bought a majority share of the company, by now called Anglo-Persian Oil.  British Petroleum, as it became in 1954, was privatised in 1979, when Mrs Thatcher sold a 5% stake to take the government’s share to 46%, a minority holding for the first time. It was only in 1987 that the government sold the last of its shares.  As one former Whitehall official put it: “The presumption that the British government should have an intimate relationship with big British multinationals especially BP and Shell was in the air you breathed.”  But, even after the sell-off, the place of BP in the life of the British nation – and at the heart of government – remains strong. Only last month, Downing Street told BP and city investors that it would not remain neutral if BP became the target of a foreign takeover.  And yet there is one big difference now: on climate change, the interests of the government, signed up to cutting its greenhouse gas emissions by 80% on 1990 levels by 2050, are not aligned with those of BP, which is pressing on with the pace of fossil fuel exploration. Critics say BP’s business model of continuing to prospect for more reserves is at odds with attempts to limit carbon emissions to keep the rise in the Earth’s temperature below 2C, the widely-agreed threshold for dangerous climate change. Keeping below that figure is at the heart of the Guardian’s Keep it in the Ground campaign. It is calling on the world’s two largest health charities, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust to move their investments out of fossil fuel companies. Both are world leaders in health research who recognise the serious threat to public health posed by climate change, but they both hold significant holdings in fossil fuels. For BP specifically, the Gates Foundation’s Asset Trust has a £243m holding and Wellcome has £118m, according to the most recent figures.   Despite the UK government’s commitment to tackling climate change, documents released under the Freedom of Information Act show that BP and the British government are still hand-in-hand.  John Ashton, the UK’s top climate diplomat until 2012, fears they are caught in old habits. He has been highly critical of the oil companies’ failure to embrace the speed of change needed.  “Britain’s overriding national interest is an effective response to climate change, which will require a carbon-free energy system within a generation or so,” Ashton told the Guardian. “This is an existential challenge to the oil and gas companies. They now face an uncomfortable choice between finding new business models, or clinging to the status quo of fossil fuel dependency and coming increasingly to be seen as enemies of the national interest.”  Not yet though. Documents from the Foreign Office reveal government policy that still barely distinguishes between the British national interest and the commercial interests of its main oil and gas companies. The Foreign Office, for example, held its annual “BP high level dinner” last July, “to strengthen the strategic relationship between BP and the FCO on global economic and energy issues”, according to heavily redacted documents marked “sensitive” and “restricted”. All the top FCO directors from the head of the diplomatic service down through the directors of the main regions, to the heads of the FCO economic, strategy, and “prosperity” units, were on the attendees list.  Tensions were running high at the time. Russia had annexed the Ukrainian territory of Crimea in March. The West would - in time - respond with sanctions against Putin’s inner circle, including Sechin, and against Russian companies, including Rosneft.  The implications for western energy security and a company like BP were profound. Europe imports a quarter of its gas from Russia, which also accounts for 13% of world oil production. BP was painfully exposed to any sanctions; by 2013 it had acquired a 20% minority shareholding in Rosneft.  The week before the annexation of Crimea, the British ambassador in Washington organised a dinner “at BP’s suggestion for the visit of BP’s chief executive of downstream operations” with several “local big hitters” from the State Department and US business. In Moscow, immediately after the Russian Crimea move, the British ambassador met BP’s Russia Energy president to discuss BP’s exposure. A note of the conversation, marked “restricted and commercially sensitive”, and which is mostly redacted, says “BP’s equities in Russia were clear: $14-15bn of investment in Rosneft”.  The inference: BP was in a fix. The British government was there to help. BP’s commercial interests would inform the precise detail of the inevitable sanctions against Russia.  If the stakes over BP and Rosneft were high geopolitically, elsewhere the British government’s support for the company was more straightforwardly commercial. The coalition agreement in 2010 promised – at Liberal Democrat insistence – to help move to a low-carbon economy. But the Foreign Office was being refocused by Conservative foreign secretary William Hague away from diplomacy towards the promotion of British trade.  It upgraded its presence to a full consular office in Calgary, Canada, in 2011 to support UK businesses investing in the region — BP and Shell both have major tar sands projects in the area. Tar sands are among the dirtiest, most-carbon intensive of fossil fuels to exploit.  For BP, this intimate relationship with ministers and officials is as natural as it appears for Whitehall. “BP is a major UK-headquartered company with significant businesses and investments in the UK and worldwide. We employ around 15,000 people in this country and are currently undertaking a multi-billion pound investment programme in the UK North Sea. As such, we have regular meetings with various UK government departments who are interested in both our business and various issues involving our industry. Many of these are at the government’s request,” the company said in a statement to the Guardian. A Department of Energy and Climate Change spokesperson echoed this position, saying: “For DECC to operate effectively it needs to have relationships with a range of key stakeholders in the energy sector, including BP. Regular meetings with these stakeholders allow government to be kept informed of new investment proposals, to explain government policy and to understand how company plans might fit into the wider policy context.” A key feature of this relationship is the revolving door between BP and government. It earned the company the moniker Blair Petroleum under Labour governments. It continues to revolve today, with former BP chief executive Lord Browne brought in to the Cabinet Office by the Conservatives in 2010 to help appoint business leaders to new boards of each government department, and former BP executive John Manzoni now chief executive of the Civil Service.  The door swung the other way last week, as BP appointed the recently-retired head of the UK’s secret intelligence services to its board. The former MI6 spy chief, Sir John Sawers, would bring invaluable geopolitical experience, said BP’s chairman.  The significance of all this for climate change is profound. Being embedded in Whitehall, it appears, has given the oil and gas multinationals confidence that the government will not act on emissions in a way that will restrict their growth.  Burke, at BP when Browne experimented with moving towards renewables, only to retreat after a shareholders’ savaging, says the oil companies know climate change represents “an existential threat” to their business.   “They’ve worked it out. The only people who have done as much thinking as them on this are the military,” said Burke. BP is “certain that government won’t act on their obligation to keep the rise in global temperatures below 2C and in fact will be allies to keep the revenues flowing.”  Asked how the company reconciled the urgent need to cap dangerous greenhouse gas emissions with its exploration of new frontiers, BP said: “Affordable, secure energy is essential for economic prosperity and we forecast that global demand for energy is set to grow by nearly 40% by 2035. The International Energy Agency’s (IEA) estimates that by 2040 up to 60% of the fuel mix will still be fossil fuels; investment to develop oil and gas will continue to be needed.”  The trouble with that, as environmentalists point out, is that the IEA’s estimate from which BP takes comfort is based on capping CO2 emissions in the atmosphere at 450 parts per million. At that level, we have by scientific consensus only a 50% chance of preventing dangerous climate change.  Lord John Browne, now 67, transformed BP from a second-tier oil company to a major player on the international stage. He became one of the most celebrated British businessmen and was dubbed the oil industry’s “sun king”. Browne – who enjoyed close ties to both New Labour’s business-friendly elite and later David Cameron’s coalition – attempted to position BP as environmentally-minded, flirting with renewables and launching the “Beyond Petroleum” PR campaign. Today, assessments of Browne’s record at BP are less gushing. Browne later admitted BP should have done more to prevent two major disasters that occurred on his watch and a long-term culture of ruthless cost cutting and risk taking, which began under Browne, has also been blamed for leading to the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010. Tony Hayward, who will be 58 on Thursday, was Lord Browne’s “turtle”. This was the nickname for Browne’s indispensable right hand men who swiftly worked their way through company ranks – a reference to the cartoon superheroes. After taking the top job, Hayward doubted whether solar and wind would ever compete with fossil fuels and closed Browne’s renewables division. For BP it was, as the Financial Times put it, back to petroleum. Hayward was forced to resign as oil continued to spill from BP’s Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico. His response to the disaster was littered with “thoughtless” gaffes, angering Republican senators and environmentalists alike. Two years later, Hayward was back. He became chief executive of Iraq-focussed oil company Genel Energy and last year became chairman of commodities giant Glencore Xstrata. Bob Dudley, 59, arrived at BP in 1999 after its acquisition of the US oil company Amoco. In 2003, Dudley – a “nice guy” from a small town in Mississippi – became chief executive of BP’s Russian joint venture TNK-BP but was forced to flee Moscow in 2008 under pressure from authorities. In 2010, Dudley became chief executive amid an existential crisis for BP. His task: salvage the company as a viable business after the worst oil spill in US history. Despite falling profits and shrinking shareholder returns, Dudley received a 25% total pay rise earlier this year which he accepted after implementing a raft of job cuts and missing safety targets."
"About 70,000 years ago, a super volcanic eruption in Indonesia released more than 2,000 cubic kilometres of material, blocking out sunlight and reducing global mean temperature by about four degrees. This rapid change in climate may have had a catastrophic impact on our ancestors, possibly cutting the human population to only 10,000 survivors. Although the academic debate surrounding this hypothesis has not yet been settled, there is strong evidence that rapid warming or cooling episodes have caused multiple mass extinctions of other species over the past 500 million years.  The likelihood of human extinction due to climate change is an open question, and one that is missed in most climate discussions. We know that the two to four degrees of projected warming this century is likely to force the relocation of people from flooded cities, shift growing seasons, cut a substantial fraction out of our GDP, and have a disproportionate impact upon the most impoverished parts of the world – but it doesn’t stop there. Today’s climate models also suggest a small probability of exceeding four degrees of warming, and research has suggested that anything beyond 12 degrees would render most of the planet uninhabitable for humanity. It is true that such dramatic warming would be unlikely. Even the most pessimistic scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predict less than a 30% chance of exceeding 6.4 degrees of warming this century, while Martin L Weitzman of Harvard ballparks the probability of human extinction-level climate change at around 1% – assuming nothing is done about it. At first glance, these may seem like acceptable odds, but let’s put this in perspective; if planes crashed 1% of the time, there would be more than 2,000 plane crashes every day. Should we really have higher safety standards for our planes than our entire planet? As Gernot Wagner and Weitzman argue in their recent book Climate Shock, consideration of these low-probability, high-stakes risks urgently needs to be incorporated into our assessment of climate change. After all, just because an event is unlikely doesn’t mean we can be dismissive of the possibility; this is why we buy insurance and wear seatbelts, it’s why we invest in diverse portfolios and countermeasures for rare national defence contingencies, and it’s precisely why we should be doing more to tackle climate change. It could be that humanity will finally start tackling climate change as it gradually becomes a much more severe problem, and hence we never reach the truly catastrophic scenarios. The most obvious and safe way to do this would be to cut our carbon emissions. This is difficult. As Wagner and Weitzman point out, entrenched economic interests mean the world subsidises fossil fuels to the tune of $500bn (£328bn) each year. Moreover, climate suffers a free rider problem – any country that unilaterally cuts emissions suffers the full economic ramifications of such a move, while the benefits only occur if all countries come to an agreement. This is slow and requires us to have foresight as to how our actions will impact the generations to come. Alternatively, the easy and fast way to reduce global temperatures would be through geoengineering. Spraying sulphate aerosols into the atmosphere would mimic the reflective particles released from volcanic eruptions, cooling the planet and returning us to pre-industrial temperatures. Such a project would probably be cheap – one tonne of sulphur dioxide would be sufficient to cancel out the climate effects of almost 30,000 tons of carbon dioxide, and Wagner and Weitzman estimate that the total cost of lowering the entire planet’s temperature is likely to be less than $10bn per year. Due to the affordability of this project, any single country could unilaterally undertake a geoengineering project, bypassing the bureaucratic hurdles and perpetual gridlock of international agreements. But the ease with which geoengineering could be used could actually be one of its biggest drawbacks. Governance difficulties multiply when every country and/or adventurous billionaire gains access to the world’s thermostat. And even if the technology were used responsibly, the aerosols would do nothing to halt ocean acidification and a myriad of other problems with carbon emissions. Furthermore, if the aerosol spraying was halted for some reason, the particles would be washed out of the sky within a month or so, and global temperatures would skyrocket faster than ever. What could induce a sudden pause in geoengineering? Other risks to human civilisation such as pandemics, warfare, or geomagnetic storms could certainly make the maintenance of such a project much harder. As Seth Baum and his colleagues at the Global Catastrophic Risk Institute argue, some of the worst risks of geoengineering might be the link forged between climate catastrophes and other shocks to humanity. When the stability of our biosphere becomes dependent on the stability of our human infrastructure, we’re baking in an automatic climate crisis to the next catastrophe. We really shouldn’t place future generations in the position of facing two catastrophic risks at once. Climate change is bad enough, so let’s cut emissions before geoengineering becomes too tempting to resist. The technology and innovation hub is funded by BT.

"France’s foreign minister warned Monday that the international community had no option but to combat climate change as there is “no alternative planet”. “We don’t have the right to fail,” Laurent Fabius told the opening of a two-day gathering in Berlin of representatives from 35 countries to pave the way for a global push to cut emissions.  “We must commit ourselves very resolutely because there isn’t an alternative solution, for the simple reason that there isn’t an alternative planet,” he added. The informal talks are taking place under the “Petersberg Climate Dialogue” initiative, launched by Chancellor Angela Merkel in 2010, to prepare for the UN climate change conference in Paris in December. French President Francois Hollande has set out an ambitious goal for the Paris meeting – an agreement to limit the rise in global temperatures linked to greenhouse gas emissions to 2C from the pre-industrial age. Hollande and Merkel are due to attend the Berlin talks on Tuesday. Fabius said that several other meetings were still scheduled before the Paris conference but warned that its success “depends on us all”. Just under 40 countries have already presented their plans towards helping achieve the target eyed at the Paris meeting, Fabius said. “It’s essential that everyone, starting with the rich countries, publishes them” before the deadline of 30 October, he added. German environment minister Barbara Hendricks said there was a “moral obligation” to fight climate disturbance and reiterated Berlin’s objective of reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 40% by 2020 from 1990 levels."

"So often, we talk about “proving” climate change is happening, or articulating changes we expect in the future from increased extreme weather. We should also talk about adaptation - how can we adapt to a future climate?  A recent film, being shown in theaters in New York City now and Los Angeles next Friday is a great success story about adaptation; decisions we can make now that may influence the fortunes of future generations. The movie, called Seeds of Time, is directed by Oscar-nominee Sandy McLeod. It is narrated by Dr. Cary Fowler who identifies the challenges agriculture will face with climate change and other potential disasters. Cary was former Executive Director of the Global Crop Diversity Trust. Their goal was to put together an international plan to preserve global genetic diversity.   Why is it important to preserve our future food resources? Well in today’s climate, food production is susceptible to extreme weather swings, particularly droughts and floods. Here in the United States, we are suffering through the third major drought since 2011. The costs to this country are billions of dollars. The current California drought is the worst in over 1,200 years.  While the west coast dries, other parts of the US are experiencing flooding as our weather swings from one extreme to another. It isn’t just the United States, elsewhere around the planet similar extremes are being observed. I’ve seen firsthand the impact of extreme weather on subsistence food production in Africa. It isn’t pretty. While politicians, political scientists and industry lobbyists may deny the connection between climate change and extreme weather, the physical scientists know better. Joining the scientists, Dr. Fowler’s main goal is to create a food-production system, which is sustainable, one that can navigate the present and future threats facing it. A major step in his effort is the safeguarding of the genetic diversity of today’s crops in large vaults where seeds can be stored for future use.  Cary is informed by past crop failures which have led to downfalls of other cultures. Those past cultures have not had the knowledge and resources that we have, attributes that should enable us to preserve food diversity. Maintenance of crop diversity is particularly challenging in an age of industrial agriculture. Today’s practices focus on monocultures that while productive, are susceptible to catastrophic loss. What would happen if a major disease or disaster decimated today’s crops? It isn’t far-fetched. Cary discusses how recent crop disease, such as the 1999 wheat stem rust could present a major risk to world-wide monoculture productivity. In addition to diseases and other risks, climate change presents a unique challenge. The changing climate will present a whole new set of risks to today’s agriculture that haven’t been present in the past decades. The vault which is located in Svalbard Norway is like an insurance policy. It is located in a remote and cold environment. It is the largest and most secure collection of crop diversity in the world. It holds 190 of the world’s most important food crops. Its location makes it immune to changes to climate for the foreseeable future. Many of the seeds can be stored for thousands of years in this site.  In his narration, Cary opines - if we can spend money and time saving banks, financial institutions, or other corporate entities, why not save valuable and non-replaceable genetic resources? I couldn’t express it better. This is a great example of being penny-wise. A simple cost-effective way to preserve the enormous value of agricultural genetic diversity. I expect that as the impacts of climate change become clearer and clearer, we will find more Dr. Fowlers who champion efforts to preserve our quality of life for future generations. He told me, Crop diversity constitutes the treasure chest of traits that our food crops will need to adapt to climate change, drought, pests and diseases. Without it, food security is at the mercy of the elements and we can expect significant drops in yield. With diversity - if we are smart and committed enough to conserve it - we can create sustainable agricultural systems that produce enough food for humanity. It should be an easy choice. For right now, watch this film and see today’s climate champion. "
"To what extent are climate scientists in some of the world’s top academic and research institutions influenced by those who think global warming is a load of baloney? That’s the question posed by Stephan Lewandowsky, professor of cognitive psychology at the University of Bristol in a paper published this month in the Global Environmental Change journal.  Lewandowsky argues that many climate scientists are affected by sustained attacks against their findings, resulting in an increased discourse of uncertainty in academic circles. “Being human, scientists operate with the same cognitive apparatus and limitations as every other person,” he writes in an executive summary. “In consequence, it is important to be aware of the factors that may cause scientists to take positions that they would be less likely to take in the absence of outspoken public opposition.” Climate scientists have long been the target of campaigns from individuals or groups who reject their findings and regard the whole concept of humans affecting global temperatures as a hoax. US academics Katharine Hayhoe and Michael Mann have spoken about the various threats they have received in the past decade due to their findings. Lewandowsky himself was the target of a coordinated and successful campaign to have a paper on climate sceptics withdrawn from the Frontiers Journal in 2013. In his latest paper, co-authoring the research with four others, he refers to this as “seepage”. Academics should not talk about a recent pause or hiatus in global warming “given that global warming continues unabated,” he argues. The paper alleges that this “seepage” may have caused scientists to change the way in which they interpret data, playing into the hands of climate sceptics. “By accepting the framing of a recent fluctuation as a ‘pause’ or ‘hiatus’, research on the pause has, ironically and unwittingly, entrenched the notion of a ‘pause’ (with all the connotations of that term) in the literature as well as in the public’s mind. “Some of that research may therefore have inadvertently misdirected public attention.” His findings are significant given nearly 200 countries are working on plans for a global deal to avert dangerous levels of warming, due to be signed off in Paris this December. The foundations for that pact are a series of major studies from the UN science agency, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), built from thousands of research papers over the past two decades. Many US politicians have used the “pause” in warming as evidence that a deal isn’t needed. Others argue the levels of uncertainty are such that countries should wait before ditching fossil fuels. Some climate scientists appear less than impressed with Lewandowsky’s paper – and the insinuation that political and media pressure has changed their findings. In a long and detailed rebuttal on a climate science blog, Richard Betts, head of climate impacts at the UK Met Office, says the decision to frame this as an “us versus them” fight is simplistic. “While talk of the “pause” is commonplace in the UK climate science community, this does not seem to be accompanied by shying away from discussing projections and risks of higher-end climate change,” he says, citing papers and conferences focusing on warming beyond 4C. Betts also rejects the claim that climate scientists believe a reduced rate of warming challenges their understanding of the greenhouse effect, but defends the community’s willingness to engage with questions on the rate of temperature rises. “The evidence also suggests that even if ‘seepage’ is real, at the very least this seepage has had no influence in watering-down UK public opinion and political action compared to other countries – and that possibly the opposite has occurred because the public are more convinced by seeing scientists being objective.” He adds: “If there is any country in the world where climate scientists can feel that their research is valued by both the public and politicians, it is the UK.” This debate will run and run. It’s worth comparing Lewandowsky’s thesis with that put forward by Oliver Geden, a German researcher, published in Nature last week warning climate scientists and advisers were offering false hope to politicians on averting global warming. “Scientific advisers must resist pressures that undermine the integrity of climate science,” he wrote. “Instead of spreading false optimism, they must stand firm and defend their intellectual independence, findings and recommendations – no matter how politically unpalatable.” He added: “Scientific advisers should resist the temptation to be political entrepreneurs, peddling their advice by exaggerating how easy it is to transform the economy or deploy renewable technologies, for instance.” A number of UN officials and analysts were quick to hit back, but the message seems pretty clear: if you’re a climate scientist, you’d best develop a thick skin."
"The actor Charlize Theron, who takes a leading role in the new Mad Max movie as a one-armed warrior driving five sex slaves to safety, has expressed her fears that a bleak future awaits the planet unless global warming is addressed.   The film is set 45 years in the future, in a post-apocalyptic world desperately short of water and fuel and ruled by a barbaric dictator who enslaves men and imprisons women for breeding and breast-milk. “It felt very grounded in real events,” said Theron at a press conference for the film, which opens worldwide this week, following its gala premiere at Cannes on Thursday. “The idea of globalisation and global warming and drought and the value of water, and leadership becoming completely out of hand.” Theron said that when she first watched a scene in the film depicting a terrifying thunder-and-sandstorm she wondered if it was a little far-fetched. “But there are images on Google right now of Sahara desert sand being blown, in that state, all through Africa. And that’s frightening. The hair lifted up on the back of my neck. What makes [the film] even scarier is that it is something that is not far off if we don’t pull it together.” Fury Road, the first in the franchise since 1985’s Beyond Thunderdome, shot for eight months in Namibia after writer/director George Miller’s native Australia – where the first three were filmed – turned unexpectedly verdant after a rainy season. Conditions on set mimicked those depicted in the film, with the airport usually closed due to dust and a waiting list if you wanted fresh spinach. Theron, who comes from South Africa, praised the country’s beauty but said she could understand why its original name translated as “the place that God created when he was angry”.  Theron stars alongside British actor Tom Hardy, who takes on the role of lone wolf former traffic-cop Max – a part which first made Mel Gibson famous. The actor doesn’t feature in the new film, but George Miller reported that Gibson did give it his blessing at the premiere. “Mel is someone who, in a sense, cannot lie,” said Miller, “and I heard him chuckling.”  When the film was first scripted at the end of the last century, Gibson had been due to be involved. But production stalled and Gibson’s age – plus his much-publicised brushes with the law – were felt to be contributing factors towards the appointment of a replacement. Added Miller: “I was heartbroken to see what was happening [to Gibson]. I’ve always known him to be a really, really good man.” Fury Road has been very warmly received by critics, both on its own terms and for injecting some blockbusting razzle-dazzle into a Eurocentric lineup at Cannes. The budget for the film was $150m (£95m), a figure it’s projected to recoup in the US alone.  Hardy is reportedly signed up for three more instalments and a separate live action show is also apparently in the works. But Miller, now 70, suggested a pause might be necessary before work on follow-ups began.  “I feel like a woman who’s just given birth to a really big baby. And then someone says: ‘When are you gonna have your next one?’”"

"Liv Darling (Letters) is correct in calling for more funding, not less, for the Children and Adolescents Mental Health Services, especially for schoolchildren. However, the point needs to be made that poverty is a major cause of mental health issues and this is now set to increase as Tory cuts will push even more vulnerable families into homelessness and debt. State schools in disadvantaged areas are the front line for these children; resources to support these families are already pared to the bone and when this is combined with the reduction in schools funding also planned by the new Tory administration, a very bleak picture emerges. Many children affected by the cuts will present behavioural difficulties and classroom teachers, teaching assistants and SENCos [special educational needs co-ordinators] in schools, SEMH [social, emotional and mental health] specialist support teachers and social services will be overwhelmed with referrals. The negative impact on the educational opportunities for these children will be immense. Cuts will also hit families with physically disabled children, and they will simply have to join the queue around the block. Grammar and private schools, which select out children like this, either through entrance tests or parental income, will see none of this. I wonder how many people who voted Tory considered issues like these before making their X?  Max Fishel (assistant headteacher) Bromley Many thanks are due to Vanessa Thorpe for her article on Little Gidding church (“Church that gave refuge to Charles I and inspired TS Eliot in urgent need of rescue”). I was baptised there three years before TS Eliot’s famous visit of 1936. It is not surprising Little Gidding inspired the romantic, high church royalist Eliot to write some of the greatest poetry of his century and it owes much to his advocacy. Perhaps Simon Jenkins does the Ferrars less than justice when he describes their community as being “dedicated to self-purification”, when in addition to their quasi-monastic discipline, they were unfailingly generous in providing hospitality, education and medical care for the impoverished local population. Little Gidding stands as a reminder of a remarkable experiment during a crucial period in the history of the English church and deserves every possible effort to ensure its preservation for future generations. Robert Torrens (Rev) Bury St Edmunds Local authorities have made £20bn savings since 2010 following reductions in government funding of 40%. Councils have worked hard to shield residents from the impact. However, efficiencies cannot be remade or buildings resold. Further local government funding reductions over the next five years is not an option. The new government must consider the consequences that further cuts, without radical reform of the way public money is spent, will have on the services that bind our communities and protect the most vulnerable. Vital services, such as collecting bins, filling potholes and caring for the elderly, would struggle to continue at current levels. It would leave other parts of the public sector, such as the NHS, left to pick up the pieces of councils scaling back services. If our public services are to survive the next few years, councils need fairer funding and the freedom to pay for them. The public sector has to stop working in silos and join up even more. We need a new settlement for England that devolves decisions about infrastructure, transport, housing, skills and health and social care to local areas so they can tackle the big issues facing residents. Councils could then ensure elderly and disabled people receive the care they deserve, young people are equipped with skills to find local jobs, desperately needed homes are built, roads are maintained to high standards and every child has a place at a good school. Cllr David Sparks, chairman of the Local Government Association, representing 375 councils Gurinder Chadha is to be applauded for hoping that her musical of Bend it Like Beckham will see a “row of young women just agog because they’ve never seen girls on stage reflecting them” (“It’s been the most satisfying thing ever”, New Review). Sadly, given the price of West End theatre tickets, I fear this may be in vain. Neil Macehiter Cambridge Two of your correspondents argue that the growth in the number of people on the planet means an increase in greenhouse gas emissions (Big Issue,). Another states our constant search for economic growth is a contributor. All three are right, but there is no politically feasible mechanism for these trends to be reversed. Similarly, developments in renewable energy and energy efficiency may slow the growth in carbon emissions a little, but they are coinciding with continuing worldwide investment in new coal- and gas-fired power stations. Therefore, if we are serious about preventing runaway climate change, we have to stop fooling ourselves that we are going to achieve it by leaving vast quantities fossil fuels in the ground. Sadly, that’s just not going to happen. Politicians, scientists and environmental campaigners need instead to focus on ways to take CO2 out of the atmosphere (carbon scrubbing and reforestation) and to cool the planet artificially (geoengineering). Richard Mountford Tonbridge, Kent"
"The chief executive of the world’s largest oil company will on Wednesday face two of the firm’s most persistent environmental activist shareholders – a nun from New Jersey and a friar from Milwaukee. ExxonMobil boss Rex Tillerson has a long history of civil but strained sparring with Father Michael Crosby and Sister Pat Daly at its annual shareholder meetings. Crosby is leading a group of investors calling for Exxon to give a seat on its board to an eminent climate expert, while Daly is pressing for emission targets that would set the company on the the path away from fossil fuels.   All this is taking place against a backdrop of mounting external pressure on the oil group that makes the confrontation at this year’s gathering in Dallas, Texas, especially significant. It comes just weeks after Exxon dispatched a lobbyist and a planning executive to Rome in an attempt to brief the Vatican on global warming. Pope Francis is shortly to publish his encyclical on the environment, which could make uncomfortable reading for many in the oil and gas industry. In a letter to shareholders before the Dallas meeting, Tillerson and his fellow directors recommended voting against Crosby’s resolution. They argued: “To set aside one seat for an environmental specialist or for any single attribute or area of expertise would, in our view, not be in the best interests of the company or its shareholders because it would dilute the breadth needed by all directors to make informed decisions for the company.” Crosby’s resolution has won the backing of influential investor advisory group ISS, which is recommending its members support the proposal. Earlier Exxon had attempted to get the measure struck off the meeting agenda on technical grounds, but were overruled by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Separately, Daly is leading a group of activist shareholders calling on Exxon to come up with a plan to cut its greenhouse gas emissions – not just emissions from extraction and refinement processes, but also from Exxon fuel products. This resolution effectively calls on the group to set out a timeframe for a transition to becoming a non-carbon energy group, phasing out fossil fuels. Again, it is opposed by Tillerson and his fellow directors, who in a letter to shareholders recommend they vote down the resolution as impractical. They told investors: “Energy is required to produce and process oil and gas, so increases in production volumes that are needed to meet the world’s rising need for energy will lead to increases in emissions from our operations and from end use by customers.” The same proposal from Daly has been asked each year for some time. Last year it received the support of 22% of investors and is expected to perform strongly again on Wednesday. Among those to have already declared their support are Calpers, America’s largest pension fund, Calvert Investments, Walden Asset Management and the West Yorkshire Pension Fund. Daly and Crosby have been attending Exxon annual investor meetings since 1997, pressing the board to address the mounting case for urgent action on environmental issues. Crosby said he had few expectations before Wednesday’s meeting, which takes place as usual at the Morton H Meyerson Symphony Centre in Exxon’s home city, Dallas. At previous meetings many voices in the audience have been fierce company loyalists or climate deniers. “I call it a liturgy. It is a ritual – it’s going through the motions,” Crosby said. Asked if he felt his message was being heard by Tillerson, he said: “There is listening that is coming out of true dialogue, and there’s being silent having already made up your mind.” The Exxon CEO fell in the latter camp, Crosby added. AOn Wednesday, colleagues of Daly will present a substantially identical resolution on greenhouse gas emissions at a shareholder meeting convened by fellow oil company Chevron. Another resolution at that meeting, led by activists at As You Sow, calls for Chevron to slash its capital spending on big projects to develop reserves, instead returning it to shareholders. The Guardian published on Monday its analysis of capital spending at the big five oil companies. It found $1tn (£0.64tn) had been paid out over nine years by the Exxon, Shell, Chevron, BP and Total. Annual spending doubled, before dipping back slightly last year, though remaining at historically high levels. In its letter to shareholders ahead of the meeting, the Chevron board said the proposal to cut capital spending “is based on a flawed, if not dangerous, premise: that stockholders would be best served if Chevron stopped investing in its business”."
"Lots of people eagerly study all the polls and reports on how many people believe that climate change is real and urgent. They seem to think there is some critical mass that, through the weight of belief alone, will get us where we want to go. As if when the numbers aren’t high enough, we can’t achieve anything. As if when the numbers are high enough, beautiful transformation will magically happen all by itself or people will vote for wonderful politicians who do the right thing. But it’s not the belief of the majority or the work of elected officials that will change the world. It will be action, most likely the actions of a minority, as it usually has been. This week’s appalling Obama administration decision to let Shell commence drilling in the Arctic sea says less about that administration, which swings whichever way it’s pushed, than that we didn’t push harder than the oil industry. Which is hard work, but sometimes even a tiny group can do it.  Take San Francisco, population 850,00, which is near the very top for percent of people who believe in climate change, according to a pollster I spoke to recently. I wish that meant that there were 850,000 climate activists in my town, or even 425,000. But I’ve watched for two years (and sometimes joined) the group of people pushing the San Francisco Retirement Board to divest its half billion dollars or so in fossil fuel investments. In April of 2013, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed an exhilarating unanimous (but nonbinding) resolution asking the Employee Retirement Board to divest. Out of the 850,000 San Franciscans, seven or eight dedicated people have kept the divestment initiative alive, while the retirement board balks, stalls and grumbles about how straightforward changes in a modest portion of their portfolio are difficult, impossible, dangerous (even as they lost tens of millions when petroleum and coal stocks crashed). The activists pushing this forward are not one percent of San Franciscans, which would be 8500 people, or .1%, 850, but about .001% of people in the city.  They’ve come this far by being dedicated, tenacious, deeply informed on the issue and on board policy, and by regularly meeting among themselves and attending most of the meetings. Occasionally they get more people to show up, but they’ve carried the weight for two years. Recently they had a substantial victory, and they may yet win. For all of us. Otherwise divestment might have slipped away in San Francisco. It’s been the same at schools from Rutgers to Stanford: small groups of students and allies have pushed divestment and, sometimes, won. This is the kind of race that tortoises, and not hares, tend to win. Sometimes small groups matter. Larger groups often do. People have the power, when we choose to use it, to act on it, to dedicate ourselves to change. We have so many stories about how power is elsewhere. As the Obama Administration nears its end, I keep hearing from the bitterly disappointed and the generally bitter, who seem to believe that one man should have reversed the status quo more or less singlehandedly. They blame, credit, and obsess about the 53-year-old in the White House. But Obama is just the weathervane, and he knew it when he was elected. Then, he implored the great wind that lifted him up and carried him along to keep going. Instead, people believed the job was done when it had just started and went home. Had the exhilarating coalition of the young, the nonwhite, the progressive, the poor who are usually excluded from political power kept it up, had they believed the power was ours, not his, we could have had an extraordinary eight years. The failures are not his alone – we can’t expect more of politicians than of the civil society that could push them. We can expect more of ourselves.  The climate movement is picking up steam – or rather wind. This January you could even see Mitt I-Will-Build-the-KXL-Pipeline-Myself Romney start to waver on the reality of climate change and its causes. Yes, that’s the same Mitt “I’m not in this race to slow the rise of the oceans or to heal the planet” Romney we heard from in 2012. In 2004 Senator John McCain actually said, while pushing emissions-control legislation: “There is strong scientific consensus about the fact that global climate change is occurring, and occurring as a result of human activity.” By 2008, he was picking a climate denier as his running mate. Corporate wind machines make them spin and spin, these ambitious men. “Marco Rubio Used to Believe in Climate Science. Now He’s Running for President”, ran a Mother Jones headline. He knows, as my mother would’ve said, on which side his bread is buttered. We complain about politicians spinning, rather than recognizing that this is exactly what we want a weathervane — or hey, a wind turbine — to do, or recognizing that it’s up to us to be that wind. That’s why the ordinary people of Richmond, California, managed to beat the candidates mighty Chevron Corporation backed to elect a full sweep of green populists to city government last November. It’s also popular to say that we need to get money out of politics, but the people in that Chevron-refinery-dominated town proved that even money can’t buy everything if people are passionately engaged. As my friend Jamie Henn of 350.org said, we don’t need to get money out so much as we need to get people in (and by that I don’t think he means obediently voting at the end of the process, but transforming the process, inside and outside electoral politics). Too many of us seem far too fond of narratives of our powerlessness, maybe because powerlessness lets us off the hook. As we head into that most dismal of situations, another unbearably long electoral cycle, many who care about climate change will say that we need an elected official who will represent us or a great majority who agree with us. But we don’t need everyone on board; we don’t need one magic person in office; we need ourselves. To act. It’s the wind, not the weathervanes."

"The world’s richest sovereign wealth fund has sunk more money into coal just three months after a high-profile pledge to dump fossil fuels as part of its commitment to responsible investing, according to financial analysis by three environmental groups. Instead of reducing its overall exposure to businesses based on coal, the Norwegian Government Pension Fund (GPF) increased its holdings by 3bn Norwegian kroner to NOK 85.8bn ($11bn/£7.3bn) by the end of last year, the report Still Dirty, Still Dangerous said. The finding underlines the difficulties of making sure investors deliver on pledges to get out of coal, oil and gas in response to an anti-apartheid style global divestment campaign. Others, including a key parliamentary committee on Wednesday, have called on the Norwegian pension fund, worth an estimated $850bn and based on the country’s oil and gas wealth, to quit coal for financial reasons. Global coal stocks have plunged more than 70% in value over the past five years, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA). However, the Norwegian government pension fund remains one of the biggest single investors in coal mining companies and coal-based utilities, according to the report. While the fund did withdraw from 32 companies last year for environment and climate reasons, it did not reduce its overall holdings in the industry. By the report’s calculations, the Norwegian fund had investments in companies responsible for 23% of global coal production. The GPF had merely reshuffled its investments between coal mining companies and electricity producers that rely heavily on coal, the report published by Future in Our Hands, Greenpeace Norway and the German NGO, Urgewald, said. “There is meaningful divestment and there is pretend divestment,” Heffa Schücking, the author of the report said.  “With the Norwegian government pension fund, they simply moved all the money from coal mining companies to coal burning companies so you don’t know if there is actual divestment at the end of the day.” The IEEFA, a US-based think tank, in a report of its own on the Norwegian government pension fund, said managers should withdraw from all mining companies with more than 20% of their output in coal, and power companies that source more than 20% of their fuel from coal-fired power plants.  Marthe Skaar, a spokeswoman for the fund, disputed Schüking’s figures. “It is wrong to say that the money we got from the sale of coal assets has been used to invest in companies that burn coal,” she said in an email. Skaar said fund managers were working with companies to improve their environmental records, and this year wrote letters to the boards of large mining operations asking for their plans for a transition towards a lower-carbon economy. “We have specifically asked for their strategy related to a future with less coal demand, estimated cost of separating the mining of coal from the company’s mining operations, and to disclose the potential timeline related to this,” she said. She also said a number of the coal mining companies produced coal used for steel mills – and not burned for electricity. But the finding spoke to rising concerns of campaigners such as 350.org, which has championed divestment as a way to transition out of a fossil fuel economy.  The Guardian and 350.org are partners in the Keep it in the Ground campaign calling on the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust, the world’s two biggest health charities, to withdraw from the 200 biggest publicly traded coal, oil and gas companies.  “It’s like committing to fight lung cancer and then doubling your shares in Philip Morris,” said Jamie Henn, a spokesman for 350. “It’s important that institutions commit not only to divestment, but to transparency and sustainable reinvestment.”   Ellen Dorsey, the executive director of the Wallace Global Fund who has worked with big investors such as the Rockefeller Brothers Fund on the issue, said the report exposed a critical gap between perceptions and reality. “While it is positive that the GPF has taken a strong stand against coal investments and reduced their overall investments in coal production, their leadership on this issue is being squandered when it is revealed that they have purchased new coal securities,” she said in an email. “It is so crucial that institutional investors are transparent about their investment strategies and holdings, across the board.” The report described a scenario in which the GPFremained heavily invested in coal around the world.  In the US, the fund invested more heavily in eight of the 10 biggest coal-burning utilities, the report said. The power companies together burn 335m tons of coal a year, producing 15 times Norway’s annual greenhouse gas emissions. In China, the fund increased its holdings in Chinese coal companies by 32% compared to 2013, the report found. In Japan, its holdings in coal grew by 21%.  And, while the fund did indeed divest from more than a dozen Indian coal companies, it re-invested 44% of the proceeds in the Reliance Group, which is one of the biggest developers of coal-fired power plants across Asia, the report found.    The Norwegian parliament has scheduled a vote on 5 June on divestment of the sovereign wealth fund.  "
"Last week the mayor of London rejected the London Assembly’s call for City Hall and the £4.8bn London Pensions Fund Authority (LPFA) to divest from fossil fuels. In the Guardian on Friday, Matthew Pencharz, the Mayor’s senior advisor on environment and energy, expanded on Boris Johnson’s rejection, arguing that there needs to be a managed transition away from fossil fuels, to avoid “a sudden cliff edge,” and that we need domestic fracking to meet our energy demand for the medium term. It’s a blow to those of us that have been working so hard on this divestment campaign – from the near unanimous vote at the London Assembly, to the hundreds of people that turned up on the mayor’s doorstep on Global Divestment Day – not least because it misses the point of divestment.  It is misleading to suggest that divestment is solely about natural gas. Putting the health, safety and emissions concerns of fracking aside (and our fundamental disagreement with the mayor’s position), the LPFA invests in coal – through companies BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto – the use of which the Conservative government has committed to ending.  The fund also invests in Chevron, BP, Nexen, Shell, Suncor Energy and Total. These companies are variously engaged in extracting Arctic oil, deepwater reserves and tar sands – expensive, carbon-intensive fuels that scientists say must stay in the ground to avoid catastrophic climate change. The mayor has committed to a 60% reduction of London’s carbon emissions by 2025, in line with a pledge from the Conservative government to limit global warming to below 2C. How does the mayor reconcile these commitments with the LPFA’s £48 million of indirect investments in the aforementioned companies? Publicly-traded fossil fuel companies can only burn 20-40% of their known reserves if we are to keep global warming below the ‘safe’ level of 2C. Yet, in 2013 they spent £443bn exploring additional reserves. These companies are betting that leaders fail to enforce their emissions caps.  Shell and Chevron have issued statements to shareholders saying that government action to limit global warming to 2C is highly unlikely, meaning they can exploit their current reserves and more. The mayor has set emissions targets while investing his pension in companies that explicitly count on those targets being missed. We are now on course for a 3.7-4.8C rise by the end of the century. This is the cliff edge we should all be deeply concerned about. Last year we hit a point of no return as the West Antarctic ice-sheet began to melt.  If the mayor is serious about limiting global warming to 2C, he needs to encourage his pension fund to redirect investment away from high-carbon unconventional fuels and towards green initiatives. We are not arguing that fossil fuel use could or should end over night. What we advocate - the LPFA selling its shares, over a managed period of five years - won’t put the lights out. Nor will it disrupt retirement plans or the world economy. It will, however, send a strong message that business as usual – where companies plan to burn more carbon than the climate can safely withstand – is no longer ethically or financially acceptable. The capital could be better invested in London’s low-carbon goods sector, already worth £25bn. Currently it is invested in fossil fuel assets that senior financial institutions, including the World Bank, Bank of England, HSBC, Goldman Sachs, Standard and Poor’s, warn could be stranded by climate legislation and thereby crash in value, another cliff edge we should all be concerned about. Divestment has precedent and support. Globally, 220 institutions have already committed to divest. The Church of England recently dropped £12m from tar sands oil and thermal coal. The question is, what kind of future does the mayor want? One where fossil fuel companies continue to spend billions searching for dangerous levels of carbon? Or where that resource is redirected into clean energy and efficiency? We hope he will reconsider before the Paris summit in December. Climate change is an issue close to many of our hearts, and one that can unite environmentalists and business, socialists and conservatives. The call for divestment doesn’t end here, and as Divest London – a committed group of volunteers across the city – we’ll make sure this is firmly on the agenda of all the London mayoral candidates.

"An unprecedented alliance of news publishers including the Guardian, El País, Le Monde and China Daily have agreed to share climate change content to raise awareness in the runup to the next UN summit. More than two dozen publishers from around the world – from the Sydney Morning Herald to India Today and the Seattle Times – have agreed to scrap licensing fees for climate change content so that members of the alliance can freely republish articles.  The initiative, called the Climate Publishers Network, aims to create a global pool of content to provide a resource for publishers to widen coverage ahead of the UN climate change summit in Paris in December. The goal is to expand the network beyond its founding partners, brought together with help from the Global Editors Network, until the initiative disbands on the last day of the COP 21 summit on 11 December. Guardian editor-in-chief Alan Rusbridger, El Pais editor-in-chief Antonio Cano and Global Editors Network president Ricardo Kirschbaum said: “We very much hope that publications across the political spectrum will join us either in using some of our material or, ideally, offering their own material as well.” Publishers that are members of the network can cherry-pick the articles they want and, if necessary, can have them translated for use on their own websites. Guardian director of digital strategy Wolfgang Blau said that the 25 founding partners represented an unprecedented mix of political leanings and geographical spread to have pulled together for such a content-sharing initiative. “It is unprecedented that such a diverse and large group of news organisations from all continents decides to collaborate in this way,” he said. “Climate change is the biggest challenge humanity is currently facing and requires new ways of collaborating across geographic as well as political boundaries.”"

"Ben van Beurden, the chief executive of Shell, has endorsed warnings that the world’s fossil fuel reserves cannot be burned unless some way is found to capture their carbon emissions. The oil boss has also predicted that the global energy system will become “zero carbon” by the end of the century, with his group obtaining a “very, very large segment” of its earnings from renewable power. And in an admission that the growing opposition to Shell’s controversial search for oil in the Arctic was putting increasing pressure on him, van Beurden admitted he had gone on a “personal journey” to justify the decision to drill.  The Shell boss said he accepted the general premise contained in independent studies that have concluded that dangerous levels of global warming above 2C will occur unless CO2 is buried or reserves are kept in the ground. “We cannot burn all the hydrocarbon resources we have on the planet in an unmitigated way and not expect to have a CO2 loading in the atmosphere that is often being linked to the 2C scenario,” he said in an exclusive interview with the Guardian. “I am absolutely convinced that without a policy that will really enable and realise CCS (carbon capture and storage) on a large scale, we are not going to be able to stay within that CO2 emission budget.” The admission from the boss of the world’s second largest independently owned oil company comes as the fossil fuel sector comes under unprecedented public pressure to change its business strategy. Shell and BP have been forced to accept shareholder demands to be much more transparent about the impact of their activities on climate change issues at annual general meetings in recent weeks. And in the latest sign of sweeping changes, the energy minister of the world’s number one oil exporter, Saudi Arabia, admitted that his country could wean itself off fossil fuels completely within 25 years. Van Beurden said Shell, along with “a majority of society”, acknowledged that climate change was a real and serious issue. He said it was highly undesirable that the world move beyond 2C. But he argued that talk of a “carbon bubble”, where a large portion of fossil fuel reserves were overvalued because they could not be used, was simplistic: it was necessary to differentiate between higher carbon assets such as coal and lower CO2 ones such as gas. And he said the fast rate of depletion of oil fields meant it was always necessary to find new reserves just to stand still. “All the oil that we have, we will use,” he insisted. “There will still be a need for hydrocarbons for years to come, and the decline in existing production is always going to be faster than the decline that the most successful [low carbon] policies can create. There is always going to be a need for investment.” Some independent surveys have argued that 80% of coal reserves, 50% of gas and 30% of oil would need to be kept in the ground, with high-cost deepwater, Arctic and tar sands projects particularly singled out as likely to be “stranded”. Shell is heavily invested in all these areas and likely to be more so when it acquires its rival BG, for which it has made a $70bn (£45bn) agreed bid. But van Beurden denies that his company is therefore exposed to a carbon bubble. He said some of the opposition to the planned oil exploration this summer in the Alaskan Arctic was emotional and difficult to engage with, but the decision was taken on rational grounds of assessing the technical risks. But the oil company boss admitted that there had been a lot of corporate and individual soul-searching, despite obtaining the go-ahead from the US authorities: “I had to go through a personal journey on that.” Van Beurden reiterated his long-espoused view that there is a moral case in favour of fossil fuels because of the role they can play bringing energy to parts of the world that have not enjoyed the same benefits in the past as the west. Shell is engaged in a number of CCS projects: one at Peterhead in Scotland and another designed to reduce carbon emissions at a tar sand project in Alberta, Canada. The company also claims to be one of the largest renewable energy companies in the world despite spending annually less than $1bn on green schemes out of a total $33bn capital expenditure budget. Van Beurden insisted that he had his hands tied from investing more heavily in CCS because they would not produce the high financial returns that investors had been used to from oil and gas. “I would lose my job over it if I just threw a few billions away [on CCS] … CCS is essential for society and ... is ultimately important for our company, but listen, I have great difficulty to have shareholders focus on the quarter after next.” But he said that the world would move to a zero-carbon energy system by the end of the century, with any fossil fuels having their carbon captured. He said already there were no technological difficulties to doing CCS, just legal, political and other impediments. Van Beurden said renewables, and solar in particular, would become very important for Shell and the world post-2050. “We probably will be working on a very, very large segment of renewable energy,” he explained. “Is there an opportunity or obligation to invest in a low-carbon energy future? Absolutely, but I know that whatever I am going to find as a business model or a technology that will work for me will take decades to pull off. But we have been active participants in solar energy, in wind energy ... in many areas we have been ahead of our time,” he added. The Shell boss justified the company’s continued involvement in climate denial lobby groups such as the American Legislative Exchange Council on the grounds that the company supported other aspects of its work. But he also signalled that Shell may withdraw its support by letting its membership lapse, saying they should “watch this space”. British oil companies, plus Statoil of Norway and ENI of Italy, are trying to develop a proactive strategy amid fear that forthcoming UN climate change talks in Paris could come up with new policies that would restrict the way they operate. The Guardian’s Keep it in the Ground campaign seeks to persuade the Wellcome Trust and the Gates Foundation to divest themselves of their shareholdings in fossil fuel companies. According to the latest figures, Wellcome held a stake of £142m in Shell as of September 2014. The Gates Foundation held £6m of Shell’s shares at the time of its latest tax filing in 2013. The Shell boss said divestment was a simplistic solution to a wider problem and could delay adopting more meaningful policy options: “I fundamentally do not believe that holds a business rationale.” Van Beurden admitted that for all his concerns about climate change, he still drives a large BMW He explained it was an endorsement of his company’s core activities: “You’ve got to believe in the product.” Note: This article was updated to clarify that Ben Van Beurden was not referring to both renewable energy and CCS when he said Shell could not invest more heavily because of investor pressure, but only CCS."

"China and India, the world’s first and third biggest greenhouse gas emitters, projected a united front on climate change on Friday with a rare joint statement that asked rich countries to step up efforts to reduce global carbon emissions.  The statement, issued by the two largest developing nations during Indian prime minister Narendra Modi’s visit to China, asked wealthy countries to provide finance, technology and other necessary support to emerging countries to help reduce their own emissions.   “The two sides urged the developed countries to raise their pre-2020 emission reduction targets and honour their commitment to provide $100bn (£64bn) per year by 2020 to developing countries,” the statement said.  While both countries stopped short of making any commitments, they said they would submit their respective plans to curb greenhouse gas emissions well before crucial global climate talks are held in Paris later this year.  India has been under pressure to make commitments after the top two emitters - China and the United States - agreed to new limits on carbon emissions starting in 2025.  Modi has signalled he will not bow to foreign pressure and will instead focus on increased use of clean energy to fight the adverse effects of climate change. He wants to quintuple India’s renewable energy capacity by 2022.  India cannot commit to emissions cuts as it still needs to industrialise and lift millions of people out of poverty, the government says.  Both countries will continue to work together in areas such as clean energy technologies, energy conservation and renewable energy, the joint statement said.  “China and India are undertaking ambitious actions domestically on combating climate change ... despite the enormous scale of their challenges in terms of social and economic development and poverty eradication,” they said.

"The Cannes film festival winds to a solemn close with this documentary from Luc Jacquet, previously responsible for one of the mega-hits of eco-cinema, March of the Penguins. There’s only a brief glimpse of a penguin this time around; here Jacquet returns to the Antarctic to tell the life story of climatologist Claude Lorius, now in his 80s, who has spent his life drilling out ice cores at enormous depth, and whose resulting analysis proved key in linking climate change and “greenhouse” gases. Jacquet presents his film very much as a head-on challenge to climate change deniers: by simply talking us through Lorius’s career, and the progress of his work, we understand the methodical processes by which he came to his conclusions. Essentially, it’s a rebuttal to background-noise deniers’ complaints about flawed science: Lorius says what he found, and what it means, with calm, unflappable detachment. We are taken through the stages: Lorius’s first trip to Antarctica to study snow; the realisation that the ratio of “light” hydrogen atoms to “heavy” in each snowflake corresponds precisely to the ambient temperature of the day of the snowfall; then decision to take core samples to study the change in temperature over time. Jacquet decribes a rather entertaining eureka moment: when ancient ice is used for a celebratory whisky, Lorius realised the trapped air that escapes can be analysed too, for its gas content.   As the voiceover describe’s Lorius’ deep-drilling operations – first to 900m, extracting ice around 40,000 years old; and then with the help of engineers at a remote Soviet base, to 3600m and 400,000 years – the simplicity of Jacquet’s method begins to hit home: this amassing of data makes the emotional charge of the film unanswerable. It makes some of the filler footage – Lorius standing heroically on snowy mountaintops, or gazing nobly across the icepack as the camera circles him – look somewhat pointless. (Having said that, the tone of brooding, world-weary ennui that the voiceover adopts is somehow bracing; Lorius seems much more at ease in the world of ideas than the current crop of telegenic Anglo-American science types we are used to seeing in the media.)  Nor does Jacquet mess about with anything like a sop to the deniers; there’s none of that undermining “balance” that a TV documentary would have to include. “The message is incontestable,” Lorius reports. Ice and the Sky acts as a kind of bookend to the Al Gore eco-lecture An Inconvenient Truth: that film, released just over a decade ago, was aimed at people who were likely hearing about climate change for the first time. Jacquet’s film is a retrenchment, a call to arms to the environmental movement destabilised and buffeted by the denial industry. Ice and the Sky ends with a direct challenge to the viewer: “Now that you know, what are you going to do?” What, indeed. This is a powerful testament, and one that ought to have a considerable impact."
"Californians may have to start rationing more than water, including how much they turn on their lights and how often they use their hairdryers. By 2050, extended years of drought in the state could lead to an electricity shortage as well as a water shortage, according to a study published on Monday in the journal Nature Climate Change.  In the study, Arizona State University authors Matthew Bartos and Mikhail Chester found that almost half (46%) of 978 electric power stations in the western US should expect to face a decrease in electricity generating capacity by “mid-century”, a timeframe coined as 2040 to 2060, due to climate change. A 10-year drought scenario would reduce the energy-producing capacity of vulnerable electric power stations by as much as 8.8%, the authors found. Worse, the study warns that current plans looking at electricity generating facilities in the western US have not taken into account the effects of climate change on productiveness, meaning they may have grossly overestimated the region’s preparedness in the face of a changing climate and its capacity to meet electricity needs more generally. In a Frankenstein-like twist – of a monster coming back to haunt its creator – Bartos and Chester found that changing weather conditions due to climate change, a phenomenon largely attributed to greenhouse gas emissions caused by burning fossil fuels like gas, oil and coal, will particularly adversely affect electricity generators that burn fossil fuels for power. The study analysed all electricity generating methods used in the area, including fossil-fuel facilities using steam and combustion technology as well as renewables like wind, solar and water. The authors found that while climate change may affect all forms of electricity production, it will have a disproportionately negative effect on older fossil fuel technologies. Renewable technologies were found to be more resilient to the effects of climate change, suggesting that a greater shift towards renewables may not just help diminish greenhouse gas emission, but may also help create a more climate-resistant power infrastructure. Speaking from Arizona, Bartos warned that summers are set to pose particular levels of strain. With temperatures rising due to the predicted ongoing effects of global warming, electricity generating facilities will fall victim to warmer waters and warmer air temperatures. Summer, Bartos said, is also the time when electricity demand is at its peak – due to air conditioners working full blast. Combine that with population increase and we may have a bit of a disaster on our hands, he said. The worst-case scenario would be a complete energy blackout. There was hope in the study, however, in that the Pacific north-west is set to fare much better than the US south-west. Preparedness and collaboration between the two regions might mean that southern Californians could continue plugging in their hairdryers after all."
"Beneath the rain-shadow and washed farmhouses,in the service of the old shore, we waited for the rising of the road,the south lane laden in sand,  the north in residue and wrack;the tide drawing off the asphalt leaving our tyres little to disperse;still, the water under wheel was forceful – cleft between the chassis and the sea –that clean division that the heart rages for. But half way out the destination ceases to be the prize,and what matters is the sudden breadth of vision: to the north, a hovering headland,to the south, a shoal of light – the sea off-guarded, but hunting:our licence brief, unlikely to be renewed. Between mainland and island, in neither sway,a nodding of the needle as the compass takes its weigh."
" Lord Turner, formerly Britain’s top financial regulator, has become the latest finance sector grandee to warn that investment industry valuations are in need of urgent review in the face of the threat posed by climate change.  The former chairman of the Financial Services Authority (FSA) warned of “a major set of problems … in the relationship between finance and the real economy”. He said national economies, banks and businesses were effectively being encouraged to prioritise short-term returns and “do nothing about climate change whatsoever”.    Turner is regarded as uniquely placed to assess the long-term investment industry’s readiness for climate change threats having largely authored the UK pension reforms a decade ago and served as the first chairman of the influential quango, the Committee on Climate Change.   His remarks follow comments from former US Treasury secretary Hank Paulson, who last summer warned of a “climate bubble that poses enormous risk to both our environment and our economy”, calling for better informed “business and investor decision-making worldwide”.  Bank of England governor Mark Carney has also commissioned a review of the economic risks posed by global warming, with a particular focus on how it might impact the insurance industry.  Turner was speaking as some of Britain’s leading long-term financial analysts, under the auspices of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries (IFoA), published a paper calling for urgent research to be carried out into the failure of the investment industry to grapple with the looming challenges presented by climate change.   Lead author Professor Richard Werner, the economist credited with coining the phrase “quantitative easing”, said academics and finance professionals had “failed dismally” in addressing how markets should treat threats such as global warming.   At the heart of his and Turner’s concerns is a financial valuation technique known as “discounted cashflows” – the most common method used by the markets to assess the current worth of an investment that is expected to generate regular future returns.   In such models, the value put on profits from future years diminishes the further out in time those profits are expected to be generated. Werner warned that under this approach “the far future may appear worthless”.   Actuaries are specialists in assessing the financial risks on the longest investment horizons, playing a key role in advising pension schemes and endowment funds. They were among the first in the financial world to warn of the challenges to the investment industry of increased longevity.   The IFoA paper anticipated that the usually conservative pensions industry may look to adopt incremental changes to accommodate economic threats posed by climate change. But it noted that what little academic research was available suggested a more radical response was required. More research on the topic was urgently required, it said.   Elsewhere, climate change campaign groups are variously looking at ways to pressure the investment industry into breaking out of traditional valuation models, which, they argue, fail to capture the risks posed by global warming.   A review conducted by the Law Commission last year provided some encouragement for those calling on pension trustees to act on climate change, with several now examining the possibility of taking a test case to the courts.   Campaigners are also looking at ways to harness grassroots support for action among pension scheme members. The Asset Owners Disclosure Project (AODP) and SumOfUs launched an online platform on Wednesday through which scheme members can call on their fund managers to vote for carbon reforms at some of the world’s largest companies.  AODP director Sharan Burrow, general secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC), which has the largest number of pension members in the world, said: “People must understand that the real owners of these companies aren’t governments or the super-rich anymore, but ordinary workers like themselves who trust their retirement funds to protect their savings from the ravages of climate change.  The first company meeting targeted by the platform is US oil and gas group Chevron, where activists have tabled a resolution to be voted on later this month. The tabled proposal calls on the company to slash multi-billion-dollar spending on exploration and bringing more reserves on tap, instead returning cash to investors.  Despite being supported by a host of campaign groups, the overwhelming majority of institutional investors are expected to comply with the Chevron board’s recommendation to oppose the resolution. "
"“Giving with the one hand and taking with the other.” The words of Professor Anne Glover, on the contradiction at the heart of the way the world’s two largest health charities invest their money. The former chief scientific adviser to the European commission neatly summed up her puzzlement over two of the world’s most incredible organisations – the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust – on climate change. Both have contributed hugely to progress in medicine and both are mindful of the grave dangers of climate change for public health. Yet both continue to invest in the companies driving the problem. Both spend millions each year on research and healthcare, but sink a chunk of their billions in capital into energy systems that will undo the work. In March, the Guardian in partnership with 350.org launched Keep it in the ground, a campaign for fossil fuel divestment, a call made in parallel with stepped-up climate reporting ahead of December’s crunch UN talks in Paris. Civil society must press statesmen and women to thrash out a package that is up to the task, but how better for it to do that than to put its own money where its mouth is? Since the campaign began, signing up 200,000 supporters in 170 countries, Syracuse University, the Church of England and Guardian Media Group itself are among the many organisations who have pledged to divest. They join more than 200 other outfits to have taken similar steps, including the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, which was built on the profits of JD Rockefeller’s Standard Oil. Critics of divestment point out that the companies will never be bankrupted: any shares sold will be bought by someone else. They charge, too, that divesters are hypocrites, since we all rely on an economy that would itself collapse without gas, oil and coal. There is no denying we need fossil fuel energy for now, especially in poorer parts of the world, but the critique misreads the argument. Going cold turkey is plainly impossible; the burning issue, as with anti-apartheid divestment in the past, is to dent the standing of the companies involved, and curb their vast lobbying power. These companies are legitimate targets because they are a brake on changes that the world needs. The great bulk of existing fuel reserves will have to be left in the ground if we are to avoid climate catastrophe. And yet the big carbon companies continue to spend billions on prospecting for more hydrocarbons, taking the hunt to the ends of the Earth in the Arctic. Their business plans would guarantee “severe, widespread and irreversible impacts” in the words of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. They have only to revise these plans, to make them compatible with less extreme warming, to see off the case for divestment. Professor Glover and Christiana Figueres, the UN’s broker-in-chief for the Paris talks, are worldly people. They back divestment not as naive impossiblists, but precisely because they grasp a political reality – that divestment strengthens the arm of those who want meaningful action. Both Wellcome and Gates – which, incidentally, funds the Guardian’s global development site – claim to screen investments to fit with their noble goals. But this week the Guardian has revealed ugly secrets about some of the companies that one or both of them invest in. We’ve uncovered an oil company, BP, allegedly linked to kidnap and torture in Colombia; an oil services company, Schlumberger, breaking sanctions in Iran and Sudan; another oil major, Shell, planning for catastrophic temperature rises; and a coal giant, Peabody, using Ebola to advance commercial aims. Do Wellcome and Gates wish to be associated with such behaviour? If not, it is time to divest."
"Climate change could help a notorious invasive weed known to trigger severe allergy attacks gain a foothold in the UK, experts have warned.  Ragweed, or Ambrosia artemisiifolia, is native to North America but has been spreading rapidly across warmer parts of Europe since the 1960s. It is still rare in the UK, but by 2050 could be scattering pollen throughout much of England, inflicting new levels of hay fever misery, research suggests.  The plant’s pollen not only induces severe allergic reactions but also extends the hay fever season from summer to autumn. Last year, researchers from the University of Leicester recorded airborne ragweed pollen levels in the East Midlands high enough to cause significant hay fever attacks. The weed is a far more potent allergy trigger than grass and experts fear it could pose a serious public health problem if it becomes established. Scientists writing in the Nature Climate Change journal found that predicted levels of global warming were likely to create conditions favourable to ragweed across large areas of northern Europe, including the UK.  They said: “Climate change and ragweed seed dispersal in current and future suitable areas will increase airborne pollen concentrations, which may consequently heighten the incidence and prevalence of ragweed allergy.”  The researchers, led by Dr Lynda Hamaoui-Laguelfrom the Laboratory of the Sciences of Climate and the Environment in Gif-sur-Yvette, France, ran computer simulations that forecast a fourfold increase in European ragweed pollen concentrations by 2050.  “Substantial increases” in pollen load were likely to occur in areas such as north-central Europe, northern France and southern England, where ragweed was rare today. Depending on the speed of dispersal, pollen levels in some locations could rise as much as 12 times. The northern spread of ragweed was expected regardless of whether a high or moderate level of global warming occurred. “Once established, ragweed is difficult to eradicate because of its long-lived seed, its capacity to re-sprout after cutting and its propensity to evolve resistance to herbicides,” the scientists said. “Our results indicate that controlling the current European ragweed invasion will become more difficult in the future as the environment will be more favourable for ragweed growth and spread, highlighting the need for the development of effective and regionally co-ordinated eradication programmes.”  Ragweed is a prolific pollen producer – one plant is capable of generating up to a billion grains per season. Its pollen can travel hundreds of miles and is resilient enough to survive a mild winter."

"A new study, just published in Environmental Research Letters by Steven Sherwood and Nidhi Nashant, has answered a number of questions about the rate at which the Earth is warming. Once again, the mainstream science regarding warming of the atmosphere is shown to be correct. This new study also helps to answer a debate amongst a number of scientists about temperature variations throughout different parts of the atmosphere.  When someone says “The Earth is warming”, the first questions to ask are (1) what parts of the Earth? and (2) over what time period? The Earth’s climate system is large; it includes oceans, the atmosphere, land surface, ice areas, etc.  When scientists use the phrase “global warming” they are often talking about increases to the amount of energy stored in oceans or increases to the temperature of the atmosphere closest to the ground. By either of these measures, climate change has led to a progressive increase in temperatures over the past four decades. But what about other parts of the climate system? What is happening to them? One important area to consider is the troposphere. It is the bottom portion of the atmosphere where most weather occurs. Tropospheric temperatures can be taken by satellites, by weather balloons, or other instruments. In the past, both satellites and weather balloons reported no warming or even a cooling.  However, that original work was shown to be faulty and now even the most strident sceptics admit that the troposphere is warming. But obtaining an accurate estimate of the rate of warming is difficult. Changes to instruments, errors in measurements, short term fluctuations all can conspire to hide the “real” temperature.  This is where the new study comes in. The authors develop a new method to account for natural variability, long-term trends, and instruments in the temperature measurement. They make three conclusions.  First, warming of the atmosphere in the tropical regions of the globe hasn’t changed much since the late 1950s. Temperatures have increased smoothly and follow what is called the moist-adiabatic rate (temperature decrease of humid air with elevation). This result is in very close agreement with climate computer models and it contradicts the view that there is a slowdown in climate change.  Second, the vertical height of the tropics that has warmed is a bit smaller than the models predict. Finally, there is a change in observed cooling in the stratosphere – the layer of the atmosphere above the troposphere. Taken together, these results show that the tropospheric warming has continued as predicted by scientists years ago.  Embedded in this research is a conclusion about the so-called “tropospheric hot spot”. This “hot spot” refers to expectations that as global warming progresses, the troposphere will warm faster than the Earth surface. The hot spot is really hard to detect; it requires high quality measurements at both the surface and throughout the troposphere. Past studies which could not detect a hot spot were often used by climate contrarians to call into question our simulation models and even our basic understanding of the atmosphere. But this new study finds a clear signal of the hotspot. In fact, the temperature in the troposphere is rising roughly 80% faster than the temperature at the Earth’s surface (within the tropics region). This finding agrees very well with climate models which predicted a 64% difference.  And this is exactly how models are supposed to work. Models can be used to predict changes that will occur in the future. Once we make measurements, we can compare them with the models. If the two disagree, it either means our models are wrong, our measurements are wrong, or both are wrong. More often than not, the models have been found to be vindicated.  In the case of the tropospheric temperatures, initially the models and experiments disagreed. Both were rechecked and scientists found the experiments were misinterpreted. When improved experiments were obtained, we see atmosphere temperature studies in agreement. This study also helps us see that the troposphere is warming as we expected. Furthermore, this is yet another study that calls into question the significance of the so-called “hiatus.” I am hopeful that more studies on this important topic will be completed in the near future. Measurements of the Earth’s climate system and their comparison against climate models provide excellent test cases for scientists to improve their understanding of the processes that drive today’s and tomorrow’s climate."

"Royal Dutch Shell has been accused of pursuing a strategy that would lead to potentially catastrophic climate change after an internal document acknowledged a global temperature rise of 4C, twice the level considered safe for the planet. A paper used for guiding future business planning at the Anglo-Dutch multinational assumes that carbon dioxide emissions will fail to limit temperature increases to 2C, the internationally agreed threshold to prevent widespread flooding, famine and desertification.  Instead, the New Lens Scenarios document refers to a forecast by the independent International Energy Agency (IEA) that points to a temperature rise of up to 4C in the short term, rising later to 6C. The revelations come ahead of the annual general meeting of Shell shareholders in the Netherlands on Tuesday, where the group has accepted a shareholder resolution demanding more transparency about the group’s impact on climate change. Hundreds of environmentalists took to the seas off Seattle in kayaks, canoes and paddleboards on Sunday to protest against the company’s’s controversial plans to drill in the Arctic Ocean. The “Shell No” protest was held close to where Shell’s Polar Pioneer drilling rig is docked. One banner read: “We can’t burn all the oil on the planet and still live on it.” Ben van Beurden, the Shell chief executive, has repeatedly stated that the fossil fuel giant is a responsible company that fully accepts the need to counter manmade global warming, has campaigned for a tax on greenhouse gas emissions, and is moving its focus from oil to cleaner fuels such as gas. But an analysis of Shell’s New Lens planning document points to an acceptance that world temperatures will rise to a level that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change argues would have a severe and widespread impact. A 4C global rise by 2100 would entail a sea level rise of between 52cm and 98cm, leading to widespread coastal flooding. There would be widespread risk of animal and plant extinctions and global agriculture would be severely hit. A 4C average would also mask more severe local impacts: the Arctic and western and southern Africa could experience warming up to 10C. The Shell document says: “Both our (oceans and mountains) scenarios and the IEA New Policies scenario (and our base case energy demand and outlook) do not limit emissions to be consistent with the back-calculated 450 parts per million (Co2 in the atmosphere) 2 degrees C.” It adds: “We also do not see governments taking steps now that are consistent with 2 degrees C scenario.” Shell strategy = catastrophic climate change. Do @wellcometrust @gatesfoundation want that? http://t.co/YtXfPcnQf4 #keepitintheground Environmentalists said the presumptions undermine Shell’s ability to talk with authority on climate change. Charlie Kronick, climate campaigner at campaign group Greenpeace, said Shell and IEA saw fossil fuels continuing to be burned, with the earth facing temperature rises of 3.7°C or 4°C in the short term, mounting to 6°C later on. “What I don’t see is a realisation from Shell about what exactly would happen to its business if climate change escalated dramatically beyond what is safe with all the negative consequences in the world for food and water never mind energy,” said Kronick. Louise Rouse, an investor relations specialist and consultant to Greenpeace, said the New Lens document undermined Shell’s claim that ongoing oil and gas exploration helps raise living standards in the developing world by supplying the energy for rapidly expanding economies. “There is an incoherence at best between oil companies on the one hand positioning themselves as being on the side of the world’s developing countries and while on the other actively pursuing strategies which will entail catastrophic climate change which we already know is having a significant impact on the global south,” she said. Friends of the Earth in the Netherlands, which has carried out its own review of activities by the Anglo-Dutch oil group, said the company often argues that it is moving away from oil towards cleaner gas but has often concentrated on the most carbon intensive forms of gas such as liquefied natural gas.  Shell’s carbon dioxide emissions have risen in 2014 and are set to increase further as it expands the business through a planned £47bn takeover of rival BG. Shell declined to comment formally on the New Lens scenarios but oil industry experts said they were not meant to be a business blueprint. Instead, they represent “plausible assumptions and quantification” designed to make executives consider events that may be only remotely possible. The expert added: “Scenarios are not intended to be predictions of likely future events or outcomes.” The Guardian’s Keep it in the Ground campaign seeks to persuade the Wellcome Trust and the Gates Foundation to divest themselves of their shareholdings in fossil fuel companies. According to the latest figures, Wellcome held a stake of £142m in Shell as of September 2014. The Gates Foundation held £6m of Shell’s shares at the time of its latest tax filing in 2013.  The Anglo-Dutch group said the BG takeover would expand its presence in controversial deep-water activities – many of the planet’s untapped fossil fuel resources are now in ocean regions that are difficult to access – but said it would also increase its presence in liquefied natural gas, a cleaner fossil fuel than oil. It added: “By combining BG’s portfolio and skills set with Shell’s capabilities, we can deliver a step change in the growth priorities for both of our companies. This means more deep water and more LNG, plays where we have strong profitability and capabilities.”"
