"Climate change “at a rate faster than at any time since the end of the ice age – change too fast perhaps for life to adapt, without severe dislocation”. That was the startling warning issued by the oil giant Shell more than a quarter of a century ago. The company’s farsighted 1991 film, titled Climate of Concern, set out with crystal clarity how the world was warming and that serious consequences could well result. “Tropical islands barely afloat even now, first made inhabitable, and then obliterated beneath the waves … coastal lowlands everywhere suffering pollution of precious groundwater, on which so much farming and so many cities depend,” says the film’s narrator, over disturbing images of people affected by natural disasters and famine. “In a crowded world subject to such adverse shifts of climate, who would take care of such greenhouse refugees?” The film acknowledged the uncertainties in the computer model predictions at the time, but noted the various scenarios had “each prompted the same serious warning, a warning endorsed by a uniquely broad consensus of scientists in their report to the United Nations at the end of 1990”. “What they foresee is not a steady and even warming overall, but alterations to the familiar patterns of climate, and the increasing frequency of abnormal weather,” it cautioned. “It is thought that warmer seas could make destructive [storm] surges more frequent and even more ferocious.” “Whether or not the threat of global warming proves as grave as the scientists predict, is it too much to hope as it might act as the stimulus – the catalyst – to a new era of technical and economic cooperation?” the film concludes. “Our numbers are many, and infinitely diverse. But the problems and dilemmas of climatic change concern us all.” The film was made for public viewing, particularly in schools and universities, but is believed to have been unseen for many years. It was remarkably prescient, according to Prof Tom Wigley, who was head of the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia when it helped Shell with the 1991 film. “It is amazing it is 25 years ago. Incredible,” he said. “It was quite comprehensive on what might happen, what the consequences are, and what we can do about it. I mean, there’s not much more.” He said the predictions for temperature and sea level rises in the 1991 film were “pretty good compared with current understanding”. “What is really striking is nothing has happened [since] to make you doubt the science as it was stated then,” said Tom Burke, at the green thinktank E3G and a former member of Shell’s external review committee. But Shell’s actions on global warming since 1991, such as major investments in highly polluting tar sands and lobbying against climate action, have been heavily criticised. In 2015, it was accused of behaving like a “psychopath” by the UK’s former climate change envoy and of being engaged in a cynical attempt to block action on global warming. Even its own former group managing director, Sir Mark Moody-Stuart, said in 2015 it was “distressing” that “remarkably little progress” had been made on climate change by Shell and other oil companies.  The revelation of the film, obtained by the Correspondent, a Dutch online journalism platform, and shared with the Guardian, has renewed the criticism.  “The film shows that Shell understood that the threat was dire, potentially existential for civilisation, more than a quarter of a century ago,” said Jeremy Leggett, a solar power entrepreneur and former geologist who had earlier researched shale deposits with Shell and BP funding.  “I see to this day how they doggedly argue for rising gas use, decades into the future, despite the clear evidence that fossil fuels have to be phased out completely,” he said. “I honestly feel that this company is guilty of a modern form of crime against humanity. They will point out that they have behaved no differently than their peers, BP, Exxon and Chevron. For people like me, of which there are many, that is no defence.” Paul Spedding, HSBC’s former global head of oil and gas and now at the thinktank Carbon Tracker, said about half of Shell’s reserve base is natural gas, the least carbon intensive of the fossil fuels. “However, its oil portfolio could be a ticking tar-sands time bomb. Tar sands, which make up nearly 30% of group oil reserves, are significantly more carbon intensive than conventional oil. As things stand, Shell’s oil production is destined to become heavier, higher cost, and higher carbon, hardly a profile that fits the outlook described in Shell’s video.” Shell had, in fact, known of the risks of climate change even earlier. A “confidential” company report written in 1986, also seen by the Guardian, noted the significant uncertainties in climate science at the time but warned of the possibility of “fast and dramatic” changes that “would impact on the human environment, future living standards and food supplies, and could have major social, economic, and political consequences”. In 1989, Shell had already taken the effects of climate change into account in the construction of an oil rig. But in the same year, the so-called Global Climate Coalition (GCC) was formed by the major oil companies, including Shell’s US operation Shell Oil. It lobbied hard to cast doubt on climate science and oppose government action, and in 1998 Shell withdrew, citing “irreconcilable” differences. However, Shell remained a member of another business lobby group that campaigned against climate action, the American Legislative Exchange Council, until 2015 and remains a member of the Business Roundtable and American Petroleum Institute, which both fought against Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan.  The company has said it has remained a member of groups that hold different views on climate action to “influence” them. But Thomas O’Neill, from the group Influence Map, which tracks lobbying, said: “The trade associations and industry groups are there to say things the company cannot or does not want to say. It’s deliberately that way.”  Shell has also lobbied directly to undermine European renewable energy targets, a sector it has invested in although at a much lower level than oil and gas. In 2016, Shell launched its New Energies division, with annual spending less than 1% of the total $30bn Shell pumps into oil and gas. Despite the company’s public support since the 1990s for carbon taxes to drive cuts in emissions, in 2015 it lobbied for exemptions for the electricity it produces and uses, particularly for its offshore oil and gas platforms. Some of Shell’s investments today are also criticised for being incompatible with the 2C warming target agreed by the world’s nations. A 2015 Carbon Tracker report concluded the company was planning to invest more than $75bn in such projects over the following decade, part of a “carbon bubble” in which reserves are being developed that cannot be burned if climate change is to be halted – a concern shared by the Bank of England and World Bank.  Another Carbon Tracker report in 2016 cited a 1998 Shell document showing the company was aware of this risk. “Shell knew about, but did not act on, the risks of a carbon bubble,” the report said. “Looking back over the last 20 years, it seems like Shell has gone backwards in terms of transparency, and is still recycling the same old green initiatives, and attempting to deflect responsibility in the face of an existential threat to its business.”  Shell was one of the first major oil companies to acknowledge the need to act on climate change and has long argued that providing affordable energy was vital for the world and its development. The 1991 film anticipated the problem: “How could [developing] countries continue to advance but leapfrog the energy-intensive face of development, by which other nations prospered before its adverse consequences came to light?” But in 2015 its own external review committee concluded Shell’s sustainability report did not “adequately convey the urgency of this [low-carbon energy] transition”. Earlier in February, Shell’s CEO Ben van Beurden said: “We believe that climate change is real and we believe that action will be needed.” Moody-Stuart, who was also chairman of Shell from 1998-2002, told the Guardian the broad criticism of the company was unfair. “I don’t think enough has been done, but I wouldn’t single out the oil industry. Governments and others have some responsibility and Shell and others have called for a price on carbon since the 1990s.”  “It hasn’t got very far at all but that is not Shell’s fault,” he said. “It is pretty unique for an industry to be actually asking for something which will increase the price of their product, but they are asking for it because that is what is needed to drive the industry in the right direction.” Burke, a former head of Friends of the Earth, agreed there is a wider problem. “It is too easy to blame it all on Shell for getting it wrong”, he said, as there has been “a broader societal failure”. Shell’s 1986 report said the climate change problem was one that “ultimately only governments can tackle”. But it also noted, over three decades ago, that the energy industry “has very strong interests at stake and much expertise to contribute. It also has its own reputation to consider, there being much potential for public anxiety and pressure group activity.”"
"I wonder when, months ago, Malcolm Turnbull decided to go to war against state-based renewable energy targets as a means of trying to wedge Labor on climate policy, and show voters his government cared about hip-pocket issues – whether he ever imagined he’d be standing behind a podium, making threatening noises about gas exports? I strongly suspect not.  It really doesn’t loom as an obvious agenda item on the bucket list of a Liberal prime minister, standing up in the prime minister’s press conference room at Parliament House and declaring: “The commonwealth government has enormous power in this area, as you know. “We have the ability to control exports.” As political Kabuki goes, that’s pretty high-octane. But as we all know, these are strange times. So why is the prime minister muttering darkly about the commonwealth’s constitutional powers when it seems that just five minutes ago, the villain of the piece was sub-optimal wind turbines in South Australia? Because Turnbull has kicked the energy policy hornets nest. By training the political spotlight squarely on energy security and climate policy, Turnbull has opened a massive, multi-faceted, complicated, significant and deadly serious set of policy issues – which he has now made his government entirely responsible for fixing. This is what happens when you kick the hornets nest. Chaos ensues, and you end up at a podium, in parliament house, going Full Metal Export – talking up your constitutional options if an industry doesn’t do the right thing and deliver sufficient supply to the domestic market to meet peaking electricity demand. Given how quickly events in this space are unfolding, and given the high risk of disorientation from all the twists and turns – let’s just take a short breath and note where we are. Let’s observe that the prime minister has backed himself and his government squarely into this corner – the fix the crisis (we generated for unrelated purposes) corner. Because lying beneath the surface of a cheap and cheerful let’s get back into the game political strategy for 2017 was, always, a seething mass of real-world problems that are the consequence of more than a decade of abject public policy failure. Problems that need to be fixed by responsible adults elected to represent our interests – and quickly. So will Wednesday’s emergency gas summit fix the problems? On the plus side, the gas companies, under intense political pressure, have made a public commitment to supplying the domestic market periods of peak demand. We have absolutely zero fine print about how that commitment will actually work, and who might bear the costs of it – but the basic principle is useful. But supplying more gas to the domestic market isn’t anything even close to a magic wand. For the commitment to make a practical difference, there also needs to be sufficient generation capacity available, and in functional condition, to use the fuel – and that has been a significant part of the problem in recent times. It’s been enough of a problem to prompt the South Australian premier, Jay Weatherill, to commit to building a brand new gas-fired power station in the state. South Australia building its own power station is another thing you mightn’t have seen coming six months ago. But here we all are. Thundering about the constitution and building power stations after two decades of privatisation. Turnbull also indicated two of the LNG exporters present at Wednesday’s meeting “gave a commitment to being net domestic gas contributors, as part of their social licence”. I’m not sure that commitment, which is obviously a handy thing to announce, represented anything more than a bit of deft market signalling – companies saying publicly what they had planned to do in any case. But despite my quibbles with absent facts and absent fine print, the one great positive to come out of the Great War On Windfarms is we are slowly but surely beginning to grapple with what is actually wrong with our creaking energy system, and what might need to change as a consequence. A political strategy is now beginning to morph into something approximating a whole of government response to the unconscionable public policy botch-up of the last decade. There’s a long way to go, and we’d all be mugs to let hope triumph over the dead weight of lived experience, particularly given the resting irrationality about climate policy in this country – but the current trajectory is worth watching."

"Dozens of programs that deal with climate change, pollution clean-ups and energy efficiency would be wiped out by by the Trump administration’s budget, which seeks to demolish parts of the Environmental Protection Agency. The regulator’s funding would be cut by nearly a third under Trump’s “America first” budget proposal (the name borrows from a phrase denounced by the Anti-Defamation League for its links to 1940s Nazi sympathisers), which requests $5.7bn for the EPA in 2018 – a $2.6bn cut, or 31%, on its existing budget. Around one in five EPA employees would lose their jobs. The president can only recommend a budget; the real thing will be written and passed by Congress. However, the blueprint makes the administration’s worldview abundantly clear.  The environmental cuts, which are even more severe than the stringent budget EPA staff were bracing themselves for, would remove funding for the Clean Power Plan and scrap all climate change research programs and partnerships. Funding for the clean-up of hazardous substances would be reduced by $330m, while enforcement of the EPA’s clean air and water laws, already considered overstretched by staff, would lose $129m – around a fifth of its budget. Large-scale clean-up initiatives for the Great Lakes and Chesapeake Bay will be eliminated and left to the states, along with more than 50 other programs including: the Energy Star energy efficiency rating; help for Alaskan villages struggling with the impact of climate change; and a grant that helps states deal with air pollution. The EPA’s office of research and development would suffer a budget cut of about half, to $250m. The White House’s budget document states the cuts would help the EPA “focus on core legal requirements” and “ease the burden of unnecessary federal regulations”. Before becoming president, Donald Trump promised to reduce the EPA to “little tidbits” and called the regulator a “disgrace”. “You can’t drain the swamp and leave all the people in it. So, I guess the first place that comes to mind will be the Environmental Protection Agency,” said Mick Mulvaney, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget. “The president wants a smaller EPA. He thinks they overreach, and the budget reflects that.” Mulvaney confirmed on Thursday that the new administration had no interest in funding to combat climate change. “We’re not spending money on that any more. We consider that to be a waste of your money,” Mulvaney told reporters at the White House. Scott Pruitt, the EPA administrator, has backed many of the cuts and delegation to the states but spoke up in support of the EPA’s work to clean up polluted sites. Staff were also reassured that enforcement of pollution rules would not be curtailed. But both areas are now under threat of hefty budget cuts.  EPA staff and green groups warned the budget would severely hobble the regulator and risk undoing the vast improvements in air and water quality enjoyed by Americans since President Richard Nixon created the agency in 1970.  “The US EPA is already on a starvation diet, with a bare-bones budget and staffing level,” said John O’Grady, an EPA biochemist and staff union leader.   “The administration’s proposed budget will be akin to taking away the agency’s bread and water,” O’Grady said, adding that the administration was “tempting fate” that other cities will now not suffer the sort of toxic water crisis that has engulfed Flint, Michigan. Margie Alt, executive director of Environment America, said the budget is “dirty and dangerous and fails to protect our health or our planet”. “Slashing EPA’s overall budget by more than a third means the agency cannot adequately enforce our clean air and clean water safeguards,” she said. “It is basically a ‘get out of jail free card’ for polluters. Congress should reject this budget.” Gina McCarthy, the former EPA administrator during Barack Obama’s presidency, said the budget “ignores the will and health of our people” in favor of special interests. “Literally and figuratively, this is a scorched earth budget that represents an all-out assault on clean air, water and land,” she said. “You can’t put ‘America first’ when you put the health of its people and its country last.” Climate change funding has been targeted in other arms of government, with climate change assistance cut from the state department and a halt on all climate-related payments to the UN. The department of energy, which is earmarked for a $1.7bn budget cut, could lose its ability to help low-income households with energy efficiency or develop its own low-carbon energy alternatives.  The budget scraps $250m in grants and programs overseen by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, including coastal and marine management initiatives that help fishing communities with their livelihoods and the impacts of climate change.  Management of public lands is set to be stretched, with the Department of the Interior targeted for a $1.6bn cut – 12% of its budget. Funding for 49 national heritage areas would be eliminated, while funds for land acquisition would be reduced. Oil and gas drilling on public land will be supported, however, with the White House stating that it will back “core energy development programs”. “The administration’s proposed budget is a non-starter for our national parks, our environment, and our cultural heritage, and should be dead on arrival in Congress,” said John Garder, budget director at the National Parks Conservation Association. “Agencies like the National Park Service and EPA cannot take care of our treasured landscapes and historical landmarks with further cuts to what are already shoestring budgets.”  A mooted revamp of Nasa to dismantle its Earth sciences in favor of deep space exploration, first highlighted by the Guardian has not come to pass, however. The space agency has received a 0.8% budget cut proposal, although its office of education would be eliminated. Robert Lightfoot, acting administrator of Nasa, said: “Overall science funding is stable, although some missions in development will not go forward and others will see increases.  “We remain committed to studying our home planet and the universe, but are reshaping our focus within the resources available to us – a budget not far from where we have been in recent years, and which enables our wide-ranging science work on many fronts.”"
"It is far too early to say whether Jesse Klaver’s GreenLeft will be a party of government for the first time in its history. But for the 30-year-old leader of a political party, the Netherlands’ youngest ever, it was not a bad election. GreenLeft was the big winner in Wednesday’s poll, leaping from four MPs to 14 in the 150-seat parliament, topping the bill in Amsterdam and overtaking the stricken social democratic PvdA to become the largest party of the left nationally.  As traditional left and centre-left parties suffer across Europe in countries including Italy, France and Britain, the Dutch GreenLeft, formed 25 years ago by a merger of communists, pacifists, evangelicals and radicals, is growing fast. A large part of its success is down to Klaver, a boyish figure in jeans, open-necked shirt and rolled-up sleeves who was first elected as an MP at the age of 24 and took over the leadership of GreenLeft in May 2015. Since then, under the “Jessiah”, as he is nicknamed, the party has gained 7,000 new members, nearly half of them under 30. Something of a throwback to classic 1970s Dutch ideals of openness and radicalism, Klaver has a Moroccan father and a mother of Indonesian descent. The far-right populism of Geert Wilders, rather than Muslim immigration, is the real threat to Dutch culture and traditions, he has repeatedly said. Properly leftwing parties in Europe had to fight the rise of the far right by standing up for their ideals, he said on Wednesday. “What I would say to all my leftwing friends in Europe: don’t try to fake the populace,” he said. “Stand for your principles. Be straight. Be pro-refugee. Be pro-European. We’re gaining momentum in the polls. You can stop populism.” In the Netherlands’ fragmented political scene, Klaver hoped to win enough seats to help form a government without the centre-right, liberal VVD party of the outgoing prime minister, Mark Rutte, the winner of Wednesday’s poll. Klaver insisted on Thursday that should still be an option given GreenLeft’s particularly strong performance, although he conceded the Dutch political landscape was now “extremely complicated”. Perhaps more likely – and he did not rule it out – is that he will be asked to lend support to a centre-right coalition so it can secure a majority. That, though, might force him to choose between his ideals and entering government. The party is unashamedly pro-European and campaigned on a mix of environmental and old-fashioned leftwing policies: tighter bonus rules, zero tax avoidance, sharing of refugees across the EU and obligatory limits on greenhouse gas emissions. Perhaps understandably, its message resonates particularly strongly with young urban voters. Besides Amsterdam, GreenLeft also performed well in university cities such as Groningen, Utrecht and Nijmegen. “Our message speaks to the population of Amsterdam, and that’s to do with the fact that Amsterdam is a metropolis with lots of young, well educated people,” said Rutger Groot Wassink, the leader of the party’s group on Amsterdam city council. GreenLeft is the main opposition group on the council behind the progressive liberals of D66 – who also fared well in Wednesday’s parliamentary election. “What we share is a very open and tolerant view of the world, socially and culturally, whether about abortion, euthanasia or the soft drugs policy,” Groot Wassink said.  “But I think the reason we’ve overtaken D66 is that we have a social-economic message of sharing fairly. In a city like Amsterdam, where inequality is rising, integration is an ongoing process, but we’ve shown it can be dealt with differently.” Klaver built his strong following through social media, town-hall style meetings and finally rallies, which were consistently among the campaign’s largest – including an Amsterdam meeting that drew an audience of more than 5,000, plus 5,000 more following live on Facebook. Inspired by Barack Obama’s US campaigns, the party’s election operation was aimed at breaking the mould of generally staid and often dry Dutch electioneering by creating a mass movement behind a charismatic personality. Groot Wassink said the success could be a blueprint for green parties in countries such as Britain. “The British system is complicated, but I think the Greens ought to be able to make an impact. People in cities understand the wellbeing of our planet is important, that we need to get off fossil fuels, organise the economy differently.” Targeting the younger generation has its drawbacks: they turn out in smaller numbers in elections, the councillor said. But he said the party had also won sympathy from more traditional leftwing voters in a city that was a PvdA stronghold for two generations. GreenLeft benefited hugely from the collapse of the PvdA, which was severely punished by voters after pushing through a series of unpopular measures as part of the ruling coalition, such as raising the retirement age and cutting benefits.  Backing also came from voters concerned about climate change in a low-lying country exposed to its dangers. Party activist Carolijn Hofte, 56, previously voted for liberal parties such as the VVD and D66, but said the environment was too pressing an issue to be ignored.  GreenLeft’s focus on social equality and renewable energy was the right one for the future, Hofte said. “I don’t think the current government has divided things equally,” she said.  “The rich are getting richer, the poor are getting poorer, and people on the lower end of the scale are being forgotten. But the other thing is the climate. We need to do something about it – we really can’t stand still any longer.”"
"It is amazing that the Volkswagen and diesel emissions scandal was not discovered earlier. In 2003 nitrogen dioxide alongside London’s Marylebone Road increased by around 20%. As we approached the 2010 legal compliance date, concentrations from traffic went up, not down, and diesel cars were shown to be much more polluting than the official tests led us to believe.  However, according to the EU parliament’s recent inquiry, no one suspected that any car manufacture was cheating. Instead it was thought to be a weakness in the test.  Extra air pollution, over and above test figures, from VW diesel cars in Germany is thought to have produced 1,200 early deaths between 2008 and 2015. However, differences between real-world and official test emissions are not confined to VW. A recent French government investigation found only four out of 52 diesel cars met emission limits when used on the road, and half those in Dutch tests showed “non-standard” behaviour.  These include reducing the pollution control after around 20 minutes (the official test duration) or when driving below the 20oC test temperature. Car manufacturers claimed that these strategies are to prevent engine damage. We will have to wait until September 2019 before all new diesel cars are required to pass a real-world test. This has implications for proposed diesel scrappage schemes. In order for it to work, new cars have to be cleaner than the scrapped ones. To be really effective this means a petrol or electric replacement.  Alternatively, the London Mayor suggests, the scrappage grant could pay for mobility and not a new car; many years of car club membership, cycle hire or a public transport pass.      "
"My partner of the last seven years and I have always been fairly ambivalent about the idea of having children. However, over the last couple of years, notably since the birth of my youngest nephew, I have found myself wavering. My sister emigrated before she had children and I now feel a profound sadness that I can only have a limited involvement in their childhoods. The feelings have become so strong that looking at photos of them causes me to well up.  If I were to tell my partner straight out that I wanted a child, I think he would probably agree to go ahead, but my own feelings are so mixed that there’s little point even raising the subject. (My partner doesn’t know how to handle emotional uncertainty whereas I have found that if I take and present a position on something, discussion is much easier.)  There are the usual concerns about finances, work, and whether we would be any good at being parents, but fundamentally, my mixed feelings stem from my belief that we are coming into an era of huge uncertainty – climate change is a reality and is likely to cause huge upheaval and mass migration of peoples, resources are becoming more scarce and I think the search for them will eventually lead to (greater) armed conflict.  Species are becoming extinct at an accelerating rate and populism and insularity are on the rise. It’s not a matter of whether these things will happen, because they are happening now, but rather how bad they will be and whether we can do anything to halt or mitigate them. While my partner and I are in the extremely fortunate position, unlike so many others, of having our own home, decent jobs and loving families, in many respects I feel that it would be unfair of me to bring a child into what I see as in all likelihood a precarious future. If I were in my 20s, I would simply wait it out to see whether the next years bring any change but I am now 36 and don’t have that time. Should I just concentrate on being the best aunt I can and support my nieces and nephews through whatever the future throws at them?  It’s great you are giving this so much thought, but you are looking, pretty much, at the worst-case scenario. And that did make me wonder, if you did have children, if you would always look at every event or outing they went on, like this. I never knew the meaning of the word worry until I had children but there are times when you do need the confidence to take a perspective on things and let go a little. I consulted Lucy Johnson, a psychotherapist (psychotherapy.org.uk), and she was struck by “the depth of sadness you feel over not seeing your nieces and nephews. I wondered whether it was easier to acknowledge your longing for them, than be able to acknowledge your longing for a child of your own?” I also wondered about a sense of loss at your sister emigrating and what you felt that left you with? We were struck by how “alone you seem in this decision. While it sounds as if your partner finds uncertainty unsettling, you will be parenting together and one of the first acts of parenting is making the choice to have the baby together.” Deciding to have the baby is really only the first big step you take together as parents – will you also be alone in the others, having to “present a position” to your partner? I wondered – and I say this really tentatively – if this wasn’t just a question of having children, but having children with this man? You made no hint of this and it’s sheer conjecture on my part, but it is something I feel is worth mentioning. There is very much just one viewpoint coming from your letter. Perhaps your partner could actually give you some perspective on this? If he really can’t, will you in effect be, emotionally, parenting solo? The fact that you are ambivalent is incredibly sensible. The choice to have a child is a big one, but because it’s so big, it’s easy to paralyse oneself by the negative what-ifs. What is harder to factor in, to imagine, are the “wows”. “What I felt was missing from your letter is hope,” says Johnson. “Women get pregnant in all sorts of desperate circumstances and in doing so, either consciously or unconsciously, they are choosing life over potential death. I wonder whether, on some level, your worry about climate change is a cover for some deeper ambivalence.” Obviously no one can make this decision for you (both), but Johnson suggests: “I wonder if, in making your decision, it might help you to move from the global to the personal, and explore the areas that you have more control over: for instance, how does the thought of creating space in your life for a child feel? What would it mean for your career or your relationship?” I also think that, to really come to a decision that is right for you you need to think not only of what happens if you do have a child, but also what it means for you if you don’t. “How would you feel,” asks Johnson, “if you decided not to have a child, and action on climate change did keep the global temperature at safe levels?” Ultimately, try to forget about everything else for a moment and think: “Where do I want to be in 10 years and who do I want to be with me?” Really, that bit is all you have any control over.

"While the Trump administration is veering sharply toward climate science denial, 19 House Republicans have taken steps to pull the party in the direction of reality, and the need to combat the threats posed by human-caused climate change.  Last week, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik (R-NY), Congressman Carlos Curbelo (R-FL), and Congressman Ryan Costello (R-PA) led a group of 17 House Republicans in introducing a resolution that calls on Congress to develop policies to tackle climate change.  The Republican Climate Resolution recognizes that environmental stewardship is a conservative principle, that policies should be based on scientific evidence and quantifiable facts, that climate change is having negative impacts and is viewed by the Department of Defense as a threat multiplier, and that we can and must take meaningful action to address these threats in a manner that doesn’t constrain the American economy: ...be it Resolved, That the House of Representatives commits to working constructively, using our tradition of American ingenuity, innovation, and exceptionalism, to create and support economically viable, and broadly supported private and public solutions to study and address the causes and effects of measured changes to our global and regional climates, including mitigation efforts and efforts to balance human activities that have been found to have an impact. The Resolution has thus far been signed by House Republicans representing districts in New York, Pennsylvania, Florida, Nevada, Nebraska, Virginia, New Jersey, Utah, Washington, and South Carolina.  Eleven of the Resolution’s signatories are also members of the Climate Solutions Caucus, as are Darrell Issa (R-CA) and Lee Zeldin (R-NY), who have not yet signed the Resolution. The Climate Solutions Caucus is a bipartisan group in the US House of Representatives – currently comprised of 13 Republicans and 13 Democrats – that explores policy options to address climate change.  Caucus members include some prominent conservative Republicans. Darrell Issa is the former chair of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, and Mia Love is viewed as a rising star in the party. Love featured in an episode of the acclaimed program Years of Living Dangerously: Altogether, this makes 19 Republican members of the House of Representatives calling for or developing policies to tackle climate change. The Republican Climate Resolution also follows a proposal by eight Republican elder statesmen in the Climate Leadership Council – including Secretaries of State and Treasury to former Presidents Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and George W. Bush – for the Republican Party to support a bipartisan revenue-neutral carbon tax. The group met with the White House to urge support for this policy. Were President Trump to throw his support behind this bipartisan, free market, small government, economically beneficial solution to climate change, along with the support of these 19 House Republicans, the policy might conceivably gain momentum in Congress. Republican voters would also support this shift. 62% of Trump voters favor a tax or regulations on carbon pollution, or both. While these voters don’t view climate change as an urgent threat or high priority, and thus aren’t too bothered by their party’s general climate denial and policy obstruction, they would nevertheless prefer that Republican policymakers take steps to address the threats posed by climate change. It would certainly be a smart move for the Republican Party. The current party policy involves rejecting decades’ worth of scientific evidence and a 97% expert consensus, and rolling back all of the progress America has made to address the threats posed by climate change.  But denying a problem doesn’t make it go away. Climate denial, much like opposition to equal rights for minorities, is a long-term losing proposition. In recent elections, Democrats have won lesbian, gay, and bisexual voters by margins of over 50%, and African-Americans by margins of over 80%. Republicans could similarly lose today’s young voters, who are particularly concerned about climate change, since they’ll have to live longer with the consequences of the decisions made by today’s politicians. Three-quarters of Americans between the ages of 18 and 29 support climate policies.  Ten of the Republican signatories of the Republican Climate Resolution are first- or second-term members of Congress. They’re relatively young and recognize that the long-term health of not just the Earth’s climate, but of the Republican Party depends on the GOP ending its practice of being the only climate-denying major political party in the world. It’s at least a promising sign that the wise old men in the Climate Leadership Council and the young rising stars of the Climate Solutions Caucus and Republican Climate Resolution all recognize the importance of bringing their party’s view on climate change into the 21st Century."
"Great tits will take over the world. You see my problem already – it’s the name. Unless you can disassociate from the Carry On innuendo of “tit”, this bird is always going to be a joke. It supposedly gets its name from titmouse: in Old English, tit means small and “mouse” is a corruption of māse, a bird name of Germanic origins. There is a theatrical prettiness about great tits: the shiny black head with flashing white cheeks, flamboyantly dapper, green-backed, yellow-breasted, with black tie and cleavage stripe. Their twin-syllabic song sounds like a drunk pushing a rusty wheelbarrow. But the music hall stage persona ends there.   Their pert, quick, neatness of form obscures a fierce nature. Watch them on the arena of a bird table: they’re tough, uncompromising scrappers, and you get the impression they’re in it for the fight as much as the food. Before the breeding season they join forces with blue tits and coal tits to become the muscle for a painted warrior cult, knocking other passerines off their perches. There are stories about them eating hibernating bats alive.  Great tits are greenwood birds, ruling the treetops where the sparrowhawks can’t get them, but they have become very successful colonists, occupying the parks and gardens we provided for them and, by charisma, flashy acrobatics and a naughty name, endearing themselves to those who hang fat balls (there’s the problem again).  Great tits have learned to thrive where the populations of many other bird species have collapsed. They have been adapting to climate change, laying eggs two weeks earlier to take advantage of milder weather and the peak in caterpillar numbers feeding on earlier leaves. They can lay 12 eggs and have two broods, although many of them are the results of cuckoldery: sexual politics in great tit society is complicated and controlled secretly by the females.  Since the 1960s, the great tit population has doubled. They range throughout Europe, north Asia to north Africa, and are becoming a global power. Parus major just means great tit, shortened from titmouse: a great small. Of the smalls this is the greatest, despite, or perhaps because of, its ridiculous name.

"One in four of the world’s children will be living in areas with extremely limited water resources by 2040 as a result of climate change, the UN has warned. Within two decades, 600 million children will be in regions enduring extreme water stress, with a great deal of competition for the available supply. The poorest and most disadvantaged will suffer most, according to research published by the children’s agency, Unicef, to mark World Water Day on Wednesday.  Drought conditions and conflict are driving deadly water scarcity in parts of Ethiopia, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan and Yemen. Unicef anticipates that more than 9 million people will be without safe drinking water this year in Ethiopia alone. Nearly 1.4 million children face imminent risk of death from acute malnutrition in South Sudan, Nigeria, Somalia and Yemen. The report, Thirsting for a Future: Water and Children in a Changing Climate, looked at the threats to children’s lives and wellbeing caused by depleted sources of safe water and the ways in which climate change will intensify these risks. As industrialisation and demographic shifts increase consumption, areas of south Asia and the Middle East will be particularly affected, according to one of the report’s authors, Nicholas Rees. “Where demand is extremely high then water stress will increase. It will go up in areas of rapid urbanisation, and we are already seeing that throughout sub-Saharan Africa and Asia,” he said. Another report published on Wednesday warned that Iran is grappling with an unprecedented water crisis, and faces a greater threat from its environmental challenges than those arising from regional political issues or terrorism. The study, from London-based NGO Small Media, said that shortages could transform vast swaths of the country into near-uninhabitable areas in the coming decades. “Iran is facing a water crisis that is unparallelled in its modern history. Lakes and rivers are dying, droughts are increasing in frequency, and even Iran’s deepest groundwater reserves are being sucked dry by Iran’s growing population and its thirsty agricultural sector,” the report said.  “Resultant soil erosion is accelerating the destruction of forest ranges across the country, and contributing to a sharp increase in dust storms and air pollution.” It warned that ecosystems were collapsing, with some species of wildlife on the brink of extinction. Lake Urmia, the country’s largest lake, is a biosphere reserve recognised by Unesco: the report says it has shrunk to 12% of its size since the 1970s, “owing to frequent droughts, and aggressive, poorly implemented water management policies upstream”.  Across the world, the UN’s report says that 36 countries are facing extremely high levels of water stress, which occurs when demand far exceeds the renewable supply available. Warmer temperatures, rising sea levels, increased floods, droughts and melting ice affect the quality and availability of water, as do sanitation systems. The impact of climate change on water sources is not inevitable, according to the report, which made a series of recommendations designed to help curb the impact of climate change on the lives of children. These include calls for governments to prioritise access to safe water for the most vulnerable children above other water needs, and for communities to diversify water sources. “We want to reduce child deaths. That is the goal. But we are not going to end child deaths without addressing environmental threats that they face,” said Rees. “We focus on their susceptibility to disease but if we don’t also address the broad environmental risks we are going to fall short. Climate change is often felt through a change in the water – whether it’s a flood, rising sea levels or something else – and the effect of a changing climate is often felt by children through water first.” The NGO WaterAid published findings on Tuesday of how vulnerable rural communities’ struggles to access clean water were being compounded by extreme weather events and climate change. India, one of the fastest growing economies and home to almost a fifth of the world’s population, was ranked in an annual WaterAid survey as having the greatest number of people living rurally without access to clean water: 63 million.  In terms of those making progress, the report said, Paraguay has achieved the biggest improvements in getting water to rural dwellers. More than 94% of its rural population now has access to safe water, compared with 51.6% in 2000. Papua New Guinea, Madagascar and Mozambique were among the worst performing countries for rural access to clean water. WaterAid’s chief executive, Barbara Frost, said many of the countries featured in the report were already being hit regularly by severe cyclones, floods and drought. “Rural communities – which are marginalised by their remote location and a continued lack of funding for basic services – often bear the greatest burden of these events,” she said. WaterAid is calling on international and national leaders to deliver on promises to meet the sustainable development goals, including a goal to ensure access to safe water and sanitation."

"A sharp drop in Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions at the end of last year came courtesy of a spike in renewable energy generation in a single month, according to a new study. Australia’s emissions fell by 3.57m tonnes in the three months to December, putting them back on track to meet quarterly commitments made in Paris after a blowout the previous quarter. The fall is the largest for the quarter since the government began recording emissions in 2001. The report’s authors said this was entirely due to record levels of hydro and wind generation in October. This brought emissions for the year to December to below the year to December 2015. But projected emissions for the December quarter were still 6.89m tonnes over levels demanded by scientifically based targets set by the government’s Climate Change Authority.  And, long term, the results show Australia is set to run more than 300m tonnes over what is required to meet its Paris targets in 2030. The analysis was produced by Ndevr Environmental, which analyses data for all Australia’s major emissions sources and compares the results with the government’s commitments made in Paris and the cuts recommended by the Climate Change Authority. It aims to produce a more timely account than the government’s, which is six to nine months behind. In the four years to December 2016, Australia emitted 20.7% of its share of what the world can emit between 2013 and 2050 if it intends to maintain a good chance of keeping warming to below 2C. If Australia continues to emit carbon pollution at the average rate of the past year, it will spend its entire carbon budget by December 2031. Projected to the current second, the graphic shows how much of the carbon budget has been spent. Matt Drum, the managing director of Ndevr Environmental, said the figures showed renewable energy was “the only thing that’s keeping us in the ballgame” of meeting climate commitments. Wind power supplied 6.4% of all national electricity market generation in October. The contribution of hydro electricity was “due in big part to all the rainfall around the Snowy mountains catchment area in NSW, which saw NSW emissions intensity figures drop significantly”, Drum said.  With the electricity sector the largest and most variable factor in Australia’s emissions, these October spikes in renewables were alone enough to drive the quarter “under the trajectory we need for Paris”, he said. But Drum said this was likely an aberration, with the return to power sector reliance on black coal, particularly for NSW, set to push the trajectory up again over a summer with record temperatures across the east coast. “We’re still churning through our carbon budget pretty quickly and, if you run a trend line from when we made our Paris commitment, we’re still way over and getting further and further behind,” Drum said. He said renewable energy was the single key factor driving down Australia’s emissions profile, ironically at a time when the sector was under attack from the federal government.  Coalition government figures have sought to blame renewables for blackouts in South Australia, despite others pointing to energy market failures.  Government figures including the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, have attacked more ambitious state renewables targets as unfeasible and talked up the benefits of new coal-fired power stations and channelling “clean energy” funding towards them. Drum said the government was “undermining the only policy lever that’s having any impact on our emissions trajectory”. “The only thing that’s keeping us in the ballgame at all is our renewable energy generation,” he said. “This makes sense when there’s no other feasible carbon policy on the table at the moment. ERF [the emissions reduction fund] isn’t doing it. Direct Action more broadly isn’t going anywhere near it … “But if they want to peel back renewables, there’s nothing left.” An independent review of the state of Australia’s environment released on Monday found the impacts of climate change were increasing and some could be irreversible. The environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, in a column for Guardian Australia, said the report “makes clear that, for the world to meet its Paris goals, there is much more to do”. He noted carbon emissions per capita had declined from 24.1 tonnes in 2011 to 22.2 tonnes in 2015. But the report showed Australia needed to “put in place a coordinated, comprehensive, well-resourced, long-term response” or risk leaving “a legacy to future generations that is inferior to the one we have inherited”, Frydenberg said. Late last year the government began a review of its Direct Action climate policy, which has been widely criticised by experts as inadequate if Australia is to meet its Paris targets. Shortly afterwards Frydenberg was forced to rule out converting Direct Action to a form of carbon trading after an internal Coalition revolt. Many experts and institutional investors argue carbon trading would allow Australia to cut emissions in line with Paris commitments at the least cost to households and businesses. The carbon budget recommended by the Climate Change Authority, which it described as “equitable and feasible”, was never agreed to by the government but represents the authority’s view of Australia’s fair share if global warming is to be kept under 2C. Direct Action is the federal government’s primary carbon reduction tool, which pays polluters to pollute less through a reverse auction – the emissions reduction fund. There is no evidence the emissions bought through that fund, now largely spent, reduce overall emissions and many of the emissions the government pays to avoid are unlikely to have occurred anyway."
"The Liberal New South Wales government, major energy users, manufacturers and businesses including BHP Billiton have urged the Finkel review of the electricity market to consider a price on carbon or a market mechanism. The submissions, released on Friday, add further pressure on the review to recommend a market mechanism to price greenhouse gas emissions, such as an emissions intensity scheme, despite the fact the Turnbull government has ruled out a carbon price or EIS.  A string of peak bodies have already called for market mechanisms, including the National Farmers Federation, the Investor Group on Climate Change and the Business Council of Australia, which explicitly called for an EIS. Three years ago some of the same groups urged the parliament to get out of the way so that Tony Abbott could repeal the Gillard government’s “carbon tax”. In its Finkel submission, Australian Industry (AI) group, representing manufacturers and other industries, supported a carbon market mechanism, saying the electricity system urgently needed a clear, efficient and durable climate policy to underpin new investment.  “A well-designed technology neutral market mechanism would be best; options include an emissions intensity scheme, as well as clean energy targets or carbon pricing schemes,” the submission says. “Any of these would need careful consultative design and broad political support to work.” But AI warned that the review should not get derailed by the type of emissions reduction mechanism, because renewables were already becoming more competitive, but rather focus on modernising the electricity system. “Our energy system is not currently set up to digest high levels of renewables, and even a well-designed emissions price signal will not of itself overcome any of the barriers to doing so,” the submission says. BHP Billiton submitted the review should be guided by the need for energy security, technology neutrality and “open and transparent markets”. It called for the “broadest possible” range of energy technologies, including renewables, “efficient coal and gas”, as well as consideration of abatement technologies such as carbon capture and storage. It said the simplest way to achieve a mix of electricity generation technologies and to meet climate goals “is to put a price on carbon emissions for the electricity system and to require technologies to offer a secure product to the market”. In its submission, the NSW government urged consideration of “the need for a mechanism that provides market signals and framing for orderly generation transition and ensures an appropriately diversified energy mix”. “These measures should be predictable and long-term so as to underpin investment confidence.” It said the market should allow for a mix of technologies, including allowing new technologies “a level playing field”. However, financial incentives should be considered where they “will encourage the optimal mix of energy services in a flexible, responsive and least cost manner”. It called for “stability” and noted the South Australian experience suggested “there is still some way to go before we manage the impacts and maximise the benefits of variable renewables”. The submission made no reference to ultra-super critical coal power plants, which the federal government is considering subsidising, instead noting the role for gas to support renewables and provide baseload power. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ACCI) called for state-based renewable energy targets to be abolished, saying states should not act unilaterally faster or further on emissions reduction targets than the commonwealth’s commitments under international agreements. Its submission said business “does not have time for ideological positions” on energy policy, and the review should consider reforms that were “technology neutral,” including a consideration of “clean coal”, carbon capture, nuclear, battery storage, gas, and solar, wind, wave, and hydro power. The Victorian government called for “clear market signals” for the evolving electricity sector to accommodate more renewable energy. Origin energy submitted that market mechanisms had a “crucial role”. It noted the Finkel review’s preliminary report, which provided support for an emissions intensity scheme, and endorsed its analysis. Origin noted that the safeguards mechanism in the Coalition’s Direct Action policy could be developed into an EIS, which had the “major advantage” of providing a marginal pricing signal while minimising the impact on electricity prices. It called for a price signal for synchronous energy to ensure the stability of the system, and said gas, hydro and coal would be needed “for some time”. Energy Networks Australia called for “a stable carbon policy, including a trading scheme for generator emissions”. The Major Energy Users Inc submitted that Australia should introduce a carbon price, such as an EIS, and ditch the renewable energy target. “There should be no need for both a price on carbon and a RET.  “With a firm bipartisan approach fully implemented, industrial consumers ... can make their decisions on how to implement their own approaches to addressing the costs of electricity (and gas) over the long term.” General Electric submitted that an EIS for the electricity sector “warrants further consideration” in the medium and long-term, cautioning the government against ruling it out. General Electric and Hydro Tasmania recommended that the renewable energy target be retained. The Energy Users Association of Australia called for “a price on carbon that recognises the position of energy intensive trade exposed industries”. It called for a technology-neutral approach, including removing subsidies for renewable energy when such technologies were mature and “no subsidies for new coal fired power stations”. The NSW Minerals Council complained that Finkel’s preliminary report did not contain mention of ultra-super critical high-efficiency coal power. It said so-called clean coal should be part of Australia’s energy mix, despite accepting that no particular technology should be subsidised or incentivised. The chairman of the review panel, Dr Alan Finkel, Australia’s chief scientist, thanked the 360 contributors and said the panel was on track to deliver the report in the middle of the year. “The breadth and depth of these submissions is a mark of the community’s determination to help shape the future of our electricity sector,” Finkel said. “It is also reflective of the message the Review Panel has received from the outset: a nation like Australia can and must rise to the challenges we face.”"
"An overhaul of the EU’s flagship trading scheme for cutting carbon emissions by European industries has been approved by the member states. The agreement to reform the emissions trading system comes after almost two years’ of discussions but just two weeks after the European parliament voted in favour of a new directive.   The acceleration in the EU’s efforts to toughen up the carbon reduction regime illustrates widespread acknowledgement of the need to plug loopholes in current legislation. The emissions trading system (ETS) is the EU’s key policy for combating climate change by reducing emissions from more than 11,000 installations in the power sector and energy intensive industries. The policy involves a market-based cap and trade system which forces companies to buy allowances to emit carbon. There have been widespread concerns that emissions were not being sufficiently capped due to an oversupply of “allowances” on the carbon market. ETS was introduced 12 years ago and initially worked well but prices plummeted after 2008 following the economic downturn. Under the proposed directive – now due for deliberation by the European parliament – the number of allowances can be gradually reduced, to push up their cost and provide an incentive for industries to adopt cleaner technologies. The cap on emissions will fall by 2.2% a year – the so-called linear reduction factor – until at least 2024. It is hoped that the new regime will deliver greater cuts in greenhouse gases while providing protection for energy-intensive industries. The highest performing 10% of factories and other installations will receive all their allowances for free, and a fund of up to €12bn (£10.2bn) will be established to help industry innovate and invest in technology. Miguel Arias Cañete, the European commissioner for climate action and energy, said: “Less than two weeks after the vote by parliament, today’s agreement demonstrates once more the European Union’s strong commitment to show leadership on climate action and help drive the global transition to clean energy. I count on everybody’s best efforts to swiftly initiate the negotiations between the council and parliament.” The revision of the ETS will now be negotiated in trialogue meetings between the parliament, European council and European commission. Environmental campaigners claim that the reformed ETS does still not do enough. A proposal to remove the rights of big polluters, such as the cement industry, from receiving free carbon credits, was not passed by the European parliament in February, frustrating many. However, the Conservative party’s energy and climate change spokesman Ian Duncan MEP, who steered the legislation revising the ETS scheme through the European parliament, said the new directive would be a crucial first step. “I am pleased the council has come to a position in good time. It is important we press ahead with this vital piece of climate-change legislation. There are many positive elements in the council position but still much work to do.”"
"The nation’s peak business body has joined the growing calls for an emissions intensity scheme (EIS) and argued coal-fired power stations should give three years notice for closure in its submission to the chief scientist’s electricity review. Jennifer Westacott, the chief executive of the Business Council of Australia (BCA) also called for no further changes to the renewable energy target (RET), given it was the foundation significant investments. She also said there was no need for state-based targets.   Westacott, representing the biggest businesses in the country, argued that in the medium to long term, an EIS was both technology-neutral and would provide the policy signal currently missing to drive investment in energy. “Australia’s 2030 emissions target has been set,” Westacott said. “What’s missing is the signal that will support the investment needed for the electricity system. “A signal such as an emissions intensity scheme for electricity is both fuel- and technology-neutral and preserves the broadest range of options to meet future emissions reduction targets. “It also creates an incentive for investment in lower emissions generation technologies.” But she warned that if an EIS was imposed too quickly, it could lead to multiple closures in regional communities and place more pressure on energy security. “Without access to competitively priced gas, an emissions intensity scheme could lead to multiple closures within one region in the short term, placing pressure on system security and regional communities all at once,” Westacott said. She said an emissions cap should be applied to coal-fired power stations to ensure they do not extend their operating lives.  “While less efficient than an emissions intensity scheme, the transition may be easier to manage and provide clearer signals for new investment in the electricity system in the short term,” she said. The BCA’s submission is the latest to urge the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, to recommend an EIS for the energy sector, effectively imposing a carbon price. Other groups calling for an EIS or carbon market mechanism include Energy Networks Australia, retailer Energy Australia, electricity provider AGL, the Climate Change Authority, the National Farmers Federation and the CSIRO. Energy policy remains front and centre for the federal government following Malcolm Turnbull’s meeting with gas chiefs to address domestic shortages and his plan for a 50% expansion in the Snowy Hydro scheme. Finkel is investigating the best way to provide security for the national electricity market at a time of rapid change in climate and technology.  After the energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, openly canvassed an EIS as one of Finkel’s options, conservatives in the Coalition party room including senior government minister Christopher Pyne objected vociferously. It led to Turnbull and Frydenberg dumping the scheme within days and was noted by the former Liberal senator Cory Bernardi as one of the last straws that drove him to establish his own party. Notwithstanding the split, Finkel’s preliminary report gave guarded support to an EIS 24 hours after the government ruled out the scheme. The Coalition won the 2013 election on the back of Tony Abbott’s anti-carbon tax policy and subsequently dismantled the carbon market system implemented by the Gillard government, with support from the Business Council.  On Thursday, Westacott said numerous modelling exercises had demonstrated an emissions intensity scheme for electricity would manage carbon abatement objectives at the least cost.  “An emissions intensity scheme provides a subsidy for less emissions-intensive generation with the cost of the scheme paid for by more emissions-intensive generators,” Westacott said. “The net effect should be no increase in price for customers.” As the government prepares for the closure of the Hazelwood on March 31 with the loss of 1,000 jobs, Westacott said better market information was required to support the transition of the electricity sector, including three years’ notice for power station closures.  “To enable effective system planning and support efficient decision making, the quality of market information could be improved by publishing aggregate fuel supplies for each region over a period of time,” Westacott said. “To support a managed transition of the electricity sector, a three-year notice period for the withdrawal of large generators and consumers could be considered. This would also give communities time to adjust. “We also need stable policy frameworks with minimal government intervention in markets to support electricity investment. Policies that suddenly shift from one place to another or see governments entering markets risk jeopardising, or at the very least confusing, this investment.” As the Turnbull government continues to attack state renewable energy targets, Westacott backed the federal government by saying state based RETs were not necessary but urged the Coalition not to change the federal RET again. “Although renewable energy targets are a source of market distortion, the RET has underpinned significant investments and it should be left alone,” Westacott said. “To make further changes would have a chilling impact on investment right across the sector. There is also no role for state-based renewable energy targets.” The BCA has argued the recommendations must ensure security of supply and restore community confidence in the national electricity market while creating conditions for energy investment to improve energy affordability. It also recommends all energy options should be kept on the table, including nuclear power, coal, gas-fired generation and capture and storage. Finkel is expected to make recommendations within the next four months."
"When Mohamed Nasheed, the young, first democratically elected president of the Maldives, said in 2008 that he was seeking to buy a new homeland to save his people from being inundated by rising sea levels, it made the country of 1,200 coral islands the moral leader in the UN climate talks and helped persuade rich countries to act. This week the Maldives, under new president Abdulla Yameen, apparently changed environmental tack, saying that mass tourism and mega-developments rather than solar power and carbon neutrality would enable it to adapt itself to climate change and give its young population hope for the future. As rumours abound that Yameen has been negotiating to sell an entire atoll with 19 coral islands and dozens of reefs and lagoons to the Saudi royal family for $10bn (£8bn), his ministers outlined plans to geo-engineer artificial islands, relocate populations and attract millions more tourists by creating 50 more resorts. In a sign of the new times, Saudi king Salman bin Abdulaziz is expected to sign a deal to buy or lease Faafu atoll in the north of the archipelago when he arrives in the Maldives next week with an entourage of 1,000 people. Yameen denied he was planning to sell the islands but praised the development deal. “What is about to happen [to Faafu atoll] is something that would feature the Maldives on the world chart more boldly than anything else,” he said.  Plans for the barely touched paradise could mean Faafu becomes a Riviera-style super-resort with sea sports, six star hotels, high-end housing and several new airports. But what happens there may be only the start of the Maldives’ transformation from an Indian ocean backwater with green political ideals to what politicians hope will be a “smart” country with a new capital city, high-tech centres, economic free zones and foreign universities to attract the global elite.  Nearly one in three of the country’s 185 inhabited islands may have to be abandoned with thousands of people relocated to larger islands which can offer schools and health clinics as well as fresh water and waste facilities, said housing minister Mohamed Muizzu.  ‘[Development of Faafu] is not selling sovereignty. We hope it is a big investment. We don’t want to move slowly. We want transformational change. We want to bring better living conditions to the whole country over a small period of time,” said Muizzu.  “Relocated families will be offered free houses on larger islands,” he said. “We need a lot of investment to provide all facilities to all islands. It is not sustainable to do this. Some islands have just a few hundred people. It is not feasible to keep them there. A lot of small islands face erosion and ground water contamination. They need sewerage networks and new harbours. The priority will be the capitals of atolls,” he said.  But in place of local fishermen living modestly on the palm-fringed coral islands, Muizzi said the newly deserted coral islands could be handed to developers. “Why not use them for tourism?” he said. Plans to increase tourism from 1.3 million people a year to more than seven million within 10 years were backed by Shiham Adam, director of the government’s Marine Research Centre. “Tourism and resorts may be the saviour of the Maldives. People are investing massive amounts of money. They are not idiots. You can build an island in four weeks with suction dredgers, and put boulders around it in a few more.  “The Maldives needs money to survive. Resorts are very positive for the environment. They offer better protection than community islands because they must protect at least 700m all around them. They become mini marine reserves,” he said. Fears of immediate sea level rise, which scientists said in the latest IPCC report was accelerating and could mean 75% of the Maldives being under water by 2100, were unfounded, Adam said. “It is not going to happen next year. We have immediate needs. Development must go on, jobs are needed, we have the same aspirations as people in the US or Europe.” “Climate change is happening but we are not leaving the Maldives to the waves,” said environment minister Thoriq Ibrahim. “We are going nowhere. The dream [of making the Maldives carbon neutral] is over. We are looking to be a low-carbon country.” “We are seeing weather patterns change. The dry season is longer, there are rainwater shortages. Now we are getting higher winds and waves. There is more salt water intrusion. Farming and fishing is affected. “But climate change is just one problem we face. The most pressing issues are water and sanitation, waste and coastal protection. Only 31 of the Maldives’ inhabited islands have a proper sewerage system. Only six have a waste system. Now is the time for action, not promises and empty words,” he said. The government accepts that its plans will increase climate emissions, even without counting the thousands of extra flights that will be needed each year to bring the hoped-for millions of tourists. But it argues that the Maldives only produces 0.003% of global emissions and has the right to develop. “We want renewable energy but we do not have the physical space for solar. We can go to 30% but above that we need storage. With international help we can reduce our emissions 30% by 2030, but without climate aid only 10%. We must be realistic,” he said. The plans have outraged the political opposition. The Maldives Democratic Party (MDP), led by former president Rasheed who is now in exile in London, said Yameen was acting without consultation. “There is outrage. No information on the proposed project has been shared with the public. The plans would allow a foreign power to control one of the country’s 26 atolls. It amounts to creeping colonisation,” it said in a statement. But the government dismissed the opposition. “A responsible opposition would always support what is good for people,” said Muizzi. “With Nasheed it was a dream. We do not need cabinet meetings under water. We do not need to go anywhere. We need development,” said Ibrahim."

"Australia’s electricity woes could be solved through a unified and publicly owned national power grid, a discussion paper has said. The paper authored by University of Queensland economist Prof John Quiggin says the creation of the national electricity market in the 1990s has failed to lower power prices and improve system reliability or environmental sustainability.  It argues the electricity grid, including physical transmission networks in each state and interconnectors linking them, should instead be publicly owned. And it says that “renationalised” grid should be responsible for maintaining a secure power supply and moving towards a zero emissions industry. Quiggin said minor changes to the current national electricity market would not be able to resolve the “energy instability” that was holding Australia back. “The price increases of the past decades and the series of recent breakdowns reflect systemic design flaws, exacerbated by the failure to take appropriate account of the implications of climate change,” he said in a statement on Friday. He said some believed a publicly owned power grid was “unthinkable” but recent political upheavals were proof unthinkable ideas should not be dismissed. “It is the only coherent response to the failure of neoliberal electricity reform, just as the establishment of a publicly owned national broadband network was the only feasible response to the failure of telecommunications reform,” he said. The director of Flinders University’s Australian industrial transformation institute, which has released the paper, said it laid down a challenge to governments of all persuasions to create a policy in the nation’s interest. “It is clear that the current system is unreliable and untenable,” Prof John Spoehr said. “This is a discussion we have to have, as a catalyst for genuine, nation building reform.”"

"The Irish Pub near Atlantic City’s famed boardwalk doesn’t have any locks on the doors as it is open 24 hours a day. So when Hurricane Sandy crunched into what was once known as the Las Vegas of the east coast in 2012, some improvisation was needed. Regular drinkers helped slot a cork board through the frame of the door, wedging it shut and keeping out the surging seawater. The wild night, which severely damaged more than 320 homes and caused a week-long power blackout, was seen out by those taking shelter with the help of several bottles of Jameson. But Sandy was just the headline act among increasingly common flooding events that are gnawing away at the thin island upon which the city sits. “Sandy, as devastating as it was, isn’t the greatest barometer because we have flash floods,” said Cathy Burke, who has run the Irish Pub since 1973. Burke, a gravelly voiced institution along the boardwalk, has hoarded treasures from Atlantic City’s zenith. The upstairs of the pub is replete with vintage furniture, gramophones and china dogs. “We can have floods at the drop of a hat,” Burke said. “Without even realizing we’re going to have them. It’ll be raining and within seconds you’ll see flooding in the street. You don’t read about it in the paper. You don’t hear about it on the radio or television. You just have water that just comes up and if you don’t have warning and move your car, you have water in the car.” These flooding events have increased seven-fold in Atlantic City since the 1950s, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and are spurred by rainfall or simply a spring tide abetted by unhelpful gusts of wind.  The casinos and boardwalk are protected on the ocean side by a network of beach dunes. But the western side of the city, where few tourists venture and poverty lingers, is more vulnerable. Several times a month water swells in the bay behind Absecon Island – the barrier strip dotted by the resorts of Atlantic City, Ventnor, Margate and Longport – and with nowhere to go can slosh into the streets, wrecking cars and stranding residents.  The rising ocean, fed by melting glaciers and the expansion of warming water, is piling up water along America’s entire eastern seaboard. To compound the problem much of the mid-Atlantic coast is sinking, a hangover from the last ice age, meaning life and property is being swamped like never before.  And yet with no overarching national sea level rise plan and patchy commitment from states, many coastal communities are left to deal with the encroaching seas themselves. Wealthier areas are raising streets and houses, erecting walls and pumps. Those without the funds or political will have several state or federal grants they can access but often make muddled choices in the face of this sisyphean task.  “There is no central place that makes all the decisions, so you get one town building a pump station to push water out and another town pumping the water back to the same place,” said Rouzbeh Nazari, an environmental engineering expert at Rowan University.  Nazari is critical of outdated flood maps, risky building in areas prone to flooding and what he considers an undue haste to buy up water-ravaged houses on the cheap to compensate homeowners rather than improve ragged coastal defenses.  “It kind of feels like we’ve just given up, that we can’t do anything about it,” he said. “I’m less worried about a Sandy-like event than nuisance flooding. They are losing 20 cars a month to nuisance flooding on Absecon Island. We need a regional solution but New Jersey has no specific plan to deal with it.” A spokesman for New Jersey’s department of environmental protection disputes claims that it lacks a plan, pointing to work with the army corps of engineers over future levees and a solution to “inadequate” stormwater systems that can exacerbate flooding. “We will be working very closely with coastal communities in identifying problem areas and the best ways to deal with them,” the spokesman said. Chris Christie, the New Jersey governor, has previously said there was no evidence that Hurricane Sandy was linked to climate change. Asked about flooding at Cape May last year, Christie said: “I don’t know what you want me to do, you want me to go down there with a mop?” In Atlantic City’s heyday, its Steel Pier hosted concerts by Frank Sinatra and the Beatles, as well as a recurring attraction where a horse was required to dive off a 60ft platform into a pool of water – a “colossally stupid idea” according to the then president of the US Humane Society. Today, it abuts the shuttered Trump Taj Mahal casino, which was sold by the president last year, as well as a tidal gauge that is quietly recording the fate of the city. The numbers are stark – the sea is rising at nearly 1.5 inches (38mm) a decade, streaking ahead of the global average and eroding away the tips of the island. Slender barrier islands such as Absecon aren’t easy to tame even with a stable sea level. Native Americans used to holiday, but never live, on the shifting sandy outcrop because they knew that it would be perennially mauled by the sea. Today, there are about 40,000 people living in Atlantic City, with the boardwalk drawing in millions of tourists to its hulking casinos.  “The Native Americans were a lot smarter than the European settlers,” said James Whalen, a former Atlantic City mayor turned state senator. “The barrier islands up and down the coast really should not have been built on, but here we are.” And then there are the storms. Ben Horton, a climate scientist at Rutgers University, said that a Sandy-like storm used to occur on the east coast once every 500 years, before industrial activity began loading the atmosphere with greenhouse gases. Now such a storm arrives once every 25 years or so. Should the sea level continue to rise sharply, by 2100 Sandy would visit Atlantic City every five years.  “If you chat to people here and you say, ‘How sustainable is the New Jersey shore or Atlantic City to an event of the magnitude of Hurricane Sandy occurring every five years?’, you’ll get a very negative response,” Horton said. The sustainability of Atlantic City consumes the thoughts of Elizabeth Terenik, the city’s spry planning director. Terenik said the rise in nuisance flooding has become a “major quality of life issue” for back-bay residents. Many of those able to have raised their homes – new buildings must now be a foot higher than previous codes due to the flooding. Terenik is plotting new sea walls, a curb on new development in flood-prone areas and an underground canal that can funnel away stormwater. Perhaps most ambitiously, she is taken by an idea, put forward by Princeton University, that would raise the streets and houses in Chelsea Heights, a vulnerable neighborhood, and allow the water to seep into vacant land to create a sort of New Jersey twist on Venice.  “It’s an exciting project but one that really needs to be looked at closely before anything’s moved forward and of course it would need funding,” Terenik conceded. “A lot of funding.” Funding isn’t such a problem 1,200 miles south at another barrier island facing a daunting challenge from the seas – Miami Beach. While it shares much of Atlantic City’s bygone glory, with its art deco grandeur and former celebrity playground status, Miami Beach – linked by causeways to the mainland city of Miami – has managed to retain much of the wealth that has allowed it to hurl money at the sea level rise problem. Pancake flat and built on porous ground that is slowly sinking back to the seabed, Miami Beach is surrounded by seas accelerating at an astonishing 9mm a year – vastly more than the 3mm-a-year global average. Should slabs of Antarctic ice start to crumble away into the ocean and fuel a 6ft sea level rise by 2100, Miami Beach will pretty much be swallowed up. “We are facing an existential threat here,” said Kristen Rosen Gonzalez, Miami Beach’s city commissioner. Gonzalez, a college professor, focused heavily on sea level rise when she was elected last year. It’s not really much of a choice these days – the mayor, Philip Levine, paddled down a flooded street in a canoe as part of an election stunt.  Once known as a “sunny place for shady people” due to its popularity with pre-war gangsters, Miami Beach is now often referred to as ground zero for the sea level rise phenomenon. But it’s perhaps more like a living laboratory experiment into what happens when you give a cashed-up place the task of avoiding drowning.  Miami Beach is spending $400m on a network of pumps, sea walls and raised streets in order to beat the tides. One vulnerable neighborhood, Sunset Harbor, has had its streets raised by 2ft at a cost of over $30m. All over the island, predominantly in the wealthier neighborhoods where properties go for $10m or more, streets are being torn up.  “We’re literally going to have to rise above this,” Gonzalez said. “That’s very scary for many of us because right now, we can’t really picture what that looks like. It is so hard to imagine parts of Miami Beach disappearing. A lot of this island is fill. We filled it in once. We’ll fill it in again.” City engineers admit that they are merely buying themselves time, perhaps 20 years or so, until Miami Beach will need to work the problem out again, possibly with some new technology. The seas are relentless, and rising ever further without end in sight. Much of southern Florida will eventually be reclaimed, but for now there is trillions of dollars of real estate to save. Retreat isn’t on the agenda, but as in Atlantic City there’s an equity issue at play. The affluent can afford to raise their homes, lobby for sea walls and water pumps, and stay in a nice hotel if it all gets a bit much.  Poorer residents are less able to do this, nor can they foot the bill for the work – Miami Beach has eye-watering average water bills of $350 a month in order to pay for the street work. Some people may have to leave if the costs mount further. Even some of the wealthier residents are buying insurance properties in areas of the mainland, farther from the coast. Valencia Gunder calls this phenomenon “climate gentrification”. Gunder is a nascent climate campaigner and resident of Liberty City, a Miami district known for its problems with crime and poverty. Gunder has been agitating, so far unsuccessfully, for some large trees to help shade the Liberty City populace from increasingly frequent heatwaves. She gives a wry smile at the mention of Miami Beach’s extreme engineering. “We’re noticing things like heatstrokes and people passing out because it’s so hot outside, people can’t take the heat,” she said.  “I do understand that you want to take care of the community that’s right on the shore, but we all are affected. Four hundred million dollars, yes, is needed for resiliency, but just to put it in one neighborhood I think is ridiculous.  “We pay taxes. We live here. We go to school here. We work here. We deserve the same treatment as other communities.” Federal leadership for communities like Atlantic City and Miami Beach is unlikely to arrive before the situation escalates further. Donald Trump’s administration has already taken aim at existing coastal resiliency funding and has disparaged basic scientific understanding of climate change.  Should the seas rise by 6ft, 13 million Americans in coastal areas will have to relocate by the end of this century, according to recent research. There will need to be a plan, beyond just cutting emissions, well before this time. In the meantime, threatened cities such as New York and Boston will mull gargantuan sea barriers, Miami Beach will hoist itself further upwards, and Atlantic City will hope a solution, or a combination of solutions, is found before the next Sandy arrives. What links these places is the reluctance to abandon them. “Miami Beach is one of the most special places in the entire world and we don’t plan on going anywhere,” said Gonzalez. “We’re going to be here for the long haul. I love this city. It’s my home. I can’t imagine there not being a Miami Beach.” Back in Atlantic City, Cathy Burke, surrounded by her Boardwalk Empire-style refinements, is similarly defiant. “I am a diehard Atlantic City native,” she said. “I love Atlantic City. I don’t want to live anywhere else. “I’ve seen hotels demolished. Storms, whatever. And as far as I’m concerned, Atlantic City will always be here and it will only get bigger and better than ever.”"
"The survival of the Great Barrier Reef hinges on urgent moves to cut global warming because nothing else will protect coral from the coming cycle of mass bleaching events, new research has found. The study of three mass bleaching events on Australian reefs in 1998, 2002 and 2016 found coral was damaged by underwater heatwaves regardless of any local improvements to water quality or fishing controls. The research, authored by 46 scientists and published in Nature, raises serious questions about Australia’s long-term conservation plan for its famous reef, which invests heavily in lifting water quality but is silent on climate-change action. The researchers said the findings of their paper, Global Warming and Recurrent Mass Bleaching of Corals, applied to coral reefs worldwide. Its publication comes the same day its lead author, Terry Hughes, is due to embark on an aerial survey to confirm the extent of another mass bleaching event on the Great Barrier Reef. It is the first mass bleaching to occur for a second consecutive year on the reef, which suffered its worst ever damage in 2016 when 22% of coral was killed off in a single hit. The study, which was unable to take in the effects of the latest event, warned a fourth mass bleaching event “within the next decade or two” gave the badly damaged northern section of the reef a “slim” chance of ever recovering to its former state. Hughes said the latest event, which was notable for having nothing to do with the warming effect of El Niño weather patterns, highlighted how research on mass bleaching, even when fast-tracked, was unable to keep pace with the reef’s current state. “It broke my heart to see so many corals dying on northern reefs on the Great Barrier Reef in 2016,” Hughes said. “With rising temperatures due to global warming, it’s only a matter of time before we see more of these events. A fourth event after only one year would be a major blow to the reef.” Hughes said he hoped coming weeks would “cool off quickly and this year’s bleaching won’t be anything like last year”. “The severity of the 2016 bleaching was off the chart.” Hughes, the convener of the National Coral Bleaching Taskforce, said the study clearly showed the need for climate change action in Australia’s reef conservation plan. He said it also showed the folly of Australian and Queensland government support for one of the world’s largest coalmines, Adani’s proposed Carmichael mine, which will export coal in ships through reef waters. This was not only because of the carbon emissions from the coal, but also from dredging and marine traffic through the reef. “In its weakened state, the reef cannot afford the Adani mine,” he said. The publication of the research comes the same week as Queensland government officials meet with Unesco officials in Paris to appeal for more time to make good on conservation efforts to ward off an “in-danger” listing for the reef. It also coincides with a visit by the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, to India to lobby Adani to proceed with its mine plan. The study found that 91% of coral on the reef had suffered from bleaching over the past two decades. The researchers concluded that “local management of coral reef fisheries and water quality affords little, if any, resistance to recurrent severe bleaching events: even the most highly protected reefs and near-pristine areas are highly susceptible to severe heat stress.” “On the remote northern Great Barrier Reef, hundreds of individual reefs were severely bleached in 2016 regardless of whether they were zoned as no-entry, no-fishing, or open to fishing, and irrespective of inshore–offshore differences in water quality.” Likewise, past exposure to bleaching, or relative resistance among certain corals to minor bleaching, gave no protection in the face of severe heat stress, the study found. Local protection of fish stocks and improved water quality “may, given enough time, improve the prospects for recovery”. “However, bolstering resilience will become more challenging and less effective in coming decades because local interventions have had no discernible effect on resistance of corals to extreme heat stress, and, with the increasing frequency of severe bleaching events, the time for recovery is diminishing. “Securing a future for coral reefs, including intensively managed ones such as the Great Barrier Reef, ultimately requires urgent and rapid action to reduce global warming.” Bleaching comes when heat stress forces corals to expel tiny photosynthetic algae, which leaves them stark white. Prolonged heat stress will kill the corals, but death rates take at least six months to confirm. The researchers said fast-growing coral took 10-15 years to fully recover while longer-lived corals “necessarily take many decades”. This kind of “sustained absence of another severe bleaching event (or other significant disturbance) … is no longer realistic while global temperatures continue to rise”, they said."

"This is going to sound like hyperbole, but it isn’t. The very worst thing about the ongoing climate change crisis is Cartoon Network’s decision to make every episode of Captain Planet available digitally. If we had all got our act together and managed to sort out this mess, Captain Planet would be an anachronism. We wouldn’t need to see his stupid blue face, or hear his stupid theme tune, or endure any more of his stupid, too-literal sermonising ever again. But, instead, he will be on Amazon Prime soon. Well done, everybody. My God, Captain Planet was the worst. Of course, you might disagree with this, because you were raised in the 1990s and are gripped by a violent desire to defend everything from that time as unimpeachably perfect. You have a foggy memory of the Captain Planet theme tune and that’s enough for you, because you are a Kangol-hat-wearing clod . Trust me, I have just been watching episodes of Captain Planet, and it is the worst.  First, Captain Planet has not aged well. We like our superheroes gritty now. We like to see all their underlying torment laid out before us like a depressing misery-buffet. Batman has to scowl. Wolverine has to suffer. Even Superman is a city-destroying murderer these days. Captain Planet, meanwhile, is a benevolent dolphin of a thing. He smiles constantly. He dresses like one of Paula Abdul’s backing dancers. Let him loose into the contemporary superhero scene and he wouldn’t stand a chance. He would be like a domesticated budgie flying back into the jungle. He would be massacred within seconds. Also – and I cannot overstate this enough – Captain Planet was useless. His entire modus operandi was to rid the world of pollution, but his only known weakness was – you have guessed it – pollution. What sort of messed-up situation is that? He’s scuppered at every turn. It is like putting Superman to work exclusively as a kryptonite distributor. It doesn’t make any sense. Captain Planet has super strength and the ability to fly. He would be much better served zapping around the world kicking terrorists’ heads off. But, oh no, go and make yourself ill next to a burst pipeline instead, you tit. No wonder he barely did anything. Captain Planet might genuinely count as history’s laziest superhero. You will remember that He-Man’s catchphrase was: “I have the power.” Meanwhile, Captain Planet’s was “The power is yours”, which he often yelled at kids before buggering off to wherever it is he is supposed to have come from. Nice one, Captain Planet. You are the infinitely powerful superbeing with the ability to effect meaningful change but, no, you’re right, go and delegate everything to some children instead. As a catchphrase, “The power is yours” is basically, “You do it” or “Listen, I would, but I’ve got a thing.” In fairness, an element of this laziness was probably justified, because Captain Planet’s enemies were arguably as terrible as he was. Betty Blight was a mad scientist who could control the weather, but was so inept that she needed to take a side-job as a lounge singer to make money. Verminous Skumm was basically a low-level drug dealer. Duke Nukem’s biggest crime was possibly his taste in shirts. That’s it. Send literally any other superhero after these no-marks and they would be brought to justice within an hour or two. Captain Planet had 113 episodes, and still managed to create exactly zero permanent solutions. Screw you, Captain Planet. You are an annoying distraction, plus your hair is rubbish. Ostensibly, Captain Planet is being released digitally to coincide with Earth Day. Far be it for me to dictate your behaviour, but you’d probably be better off commemorating Earth Day by fishing cans out of a lake or something. I know nostalgia is telling you otherwise, but you really shouldn’t waste your time on this pointless blue oaf."

"The record-breaking heat that made 2016 the hottest year ever recorded has continued into 2017, pushing the world into “truly uncharted territory”, according to the World Meteorological Organisation. The WMO’s assessment of the climate in 2016, published on Tuesday, reports unprecedented heat across the globe, exceptionally low ice at both poles and surging sea-level rise.  Global warming is largely being driven by emissions from human activities, but a strong El Niño – a natural climate cycle – added to the heat in 2016. The El Niño is now waning, but the extremes continue to be seen, with temperature records tumbling in the US in February and polar heatwaves pushing ice cover to new lows. “Even without a strong El Niño in 2017, we are seeing other remarkable changes across the planet that are challenging the limits of our understanding of the climate system. We are now in truly uncharted territory,” said David Carlson, director of the WMO’s world climate research programme. “Earth is a planet in upheaval due to human-caused changes in the atmosphere,” said Jeffrey Kargel, a glaciologist at the University of Arizona in the US. “In general, drastically changing conditions do not help civilisation, which thrives on stability.”  The WMO report was “startling”, said Prof David Reay, an emissions expert at the University of Edinburgh: “The need for concerted action on climate change has never been so stark nor the stakes so high.” The new WMO assessment also prompted some scientists to criticise Donald Trump. “While the data show an ever increasing impact of human activities on the climate system, the Trump administration and senior Republicans in Congress continue to bury their heads in the sand,” said Prof Sir Robert Watson, a distinguished climate scientist at the UK’s University of East Anglia and a former head of the UN’s climate science panel. “Our children and grandchildren will look back on the climate deniers and ask how they could have sacrificed the planet for the sake of cheap fossil fuel energy, when the cost of inaction exceeds the cost of a transition to a low-carbon economy,” Watson said. Trump is aiming to cut climate change research. But the WMO’s secretary-general Petteri Taalas said: “Continued investment in climate research and observations is vital if our scientific knowledge is to keep pace with the rapid rate of climate change.” 2016 saw the hottest global average among thermometer measurements stretching back to 1880. But scientific research indicates the world was last this warm about 115,000 years ago and that the planet has not experienced such high levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere for 4m years. 2017 has seen temperature records continue to tumble, in the US where February was exceptionally warm, and in Australia, where prolonged and extreme heat struck many states. The consequences have been particularly stark at the poles. “Arctic ice conditions have been tracking at record low conditions since October, persisting for six consecutive months, something not seen before in the [four-decade] satellite data record,” said Prof Julienne Stroeve, at University College London in the UK. “Over in the southern hemisphere, the sea ice also broke new record lows in the seasonal maximum and minimum extents, leading to the least amount of global sea ice ever recorded.” Emily Shuckburgh, at the British Antarctic Survey, said: “The Arctic may be remote, but changes that occur there directly affect us. The melting of the Greenland ice sheet is already contributing significantly to sea level rise, and new research is highlighting that the melting of Arctic sea ice can alter weather conditions across Europe, Asia and North America.” Global sea level rise surged between November 2014 and February 2016, with the El Niño event helping the oceans rise by 15mm. That jump would have take five years under the steady rise seen in recent decades, as ice caps melt and oceans get warmer and expand in volume. Final data for 2016 sea level rise have yet to be published. Climate change harms people most directly by increasing the risk of extreme weather events and the WMO report states that these raised risks can increasingly be calculated. For example, the Arctic heatwaves are made tens of times more likely and the soaring temperatures seen in Australia in February were made twice as likely. “With levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere consistently breaking new records, the influence of human activities on the climate system has become more and more evident,” said Taalas."
"The extent of Arctic ice has fallen to a new wintertime low, as climate change drives freakishly high temperatures in the polar regions.  The ice cap grows during the winter months and usually reaches its maximum in early March. But the 2017 maximum was 14.4m sq km, lower than any year in the 38-year satellite record, according to researchers at the US National Snow and Ice Data Centre (NSIDC) and Nasa.   “I have been looking at Arctic weather patterns for 35 years and have never seen anything close to what we’ve experienced these past two winters,” said NSIDC’s director, Mark Serreze. 2017 is the third year in a row the Arctic’s winter ice has set a new low.  The new record comes a day after the UN’s World Meteorological Organisation warned that the record-breaking heat that made 2016 the hottest year ever recorded has continued into 2017, pushing the world into “truly uncharted territory”.  The dramatic melting of Arctic ice is already driving extreme weather that affects hundreds of millions of people across North America, Europe and Asia, according to emerging research. The extreme low in winter Arctic ice follows a very warm autumn and winter, the NSIDC scientists said, with air temperatures 2.5C above average across the Arctic Ocean. Temperatures have soared even higher in places, creating polar “heatwaves”.  Data from the European Space Agency’s CryoSat-2 satellite also shows that this winter’s ice cover was slightly thinner than over the past four years.  “Thin ice and beset by warm weather – not a good way to begin the melt season,” said NSIDC’s lead scientist, Ted Scambos. Prof Julienne Stroeve, at University College London, said: “Such thin ice going into the melt season sets us up for the possibility of record low sea-ice conditions this September.”  The Arctic ice cap fell to its second lowest summer extent on record in September 2016, just ahead of the lowest ever mark set in 2012. “The long-term decline is a clear indicator of climate change,” said Nasa scientist Walt Meier. A record low has also been set in the southern hemisphere, currently in the summer season, where Antarctic sea ice fell to it lowest extent on 3 March, at 2.1m sq km – the lowest in the satellite record. However, scientists caution that Antarctic ice extent is highly variable from year to year. Rod Downie, WWF’s polar programme manager, said: “The annual freeze and thaw of sea ice in the polar regions is like the beating heart of our planet, driving ocean circulation and regulating our climate. But sea ice is in decline in a warming world and the records have been shattered this year. “We need to act now to lower our carbon emissions by improving energy efficiency, switching from fossil fuels to renewable energy and tackling climate change head on,” he said."

"For some of us the future really is bright. Researchers have been tracking changes in the apparent brightness of the sun for decades. Globally there was a gradual dimming from the 1940s to the 1980s, but since then the sunlight has been increasing in some areas.   This “solar brightening” effect has been noted in Europe and north America, while other areas, including China and India, have continued to experience dimming. Natural variations in cloud cover may be partly responsible, but the effects are likely to be related to airborne pollutants, especially particulates. These reflect sunlight, and can influence the formation of clouds.  The timing of the brightening in the US and Europe corresponds to new clean-air laws, while particulates have increased in China and India as dimming has intensified. The effect is relatively small, less than one per cent of total sunlight. But it may influence plant growth, as growing things are sensitive to available sunlight.  In a paper, published in Nature, crop researchers estimate that solar brightening has been responsible for 27% of the increase in US corn production over the last 30 years. It had been assumed that all the improvement was down to better fertiliser, pesticide and grain. The continuing brightening is good news for farmers in the areas where it is happening. However, the findings also mean that earlier models used to predict crop yields were inaccurate. Our food supply may depend, more than anyone realised, on subtle environmental factors.      "
"The cost of supporting new windfarms and nuclear power stations to meet the UK’s carbon targets will add nearly £100 to the average household energy bill by the end of the next decade, according to a government adviser. But the Committee on Climate Change said it expected the increase to be more than offset by savings as people switched to more efficient fridge freezers, LED bulbs and better boilers.   The committee, a body of experts set up under the Climate Change Act to advise the government, found that a rise of £105, or 9%, to the average £1,160 dual fuel bill in 2016 was down to green policies. These included subsidies for windfarms and solar power through schemes such as the Renewables Obligation. A report by the committee predicts that meeting the UK’s carbon targets would see the cost of the subsidies rise to £200 of an average bill of £1,350 by 2030. However, other factors were involved in the net increase. The committee also calculated that rising wholesale energy costs and other issues will add more than £200 a year to bills, while an ongoing switch to more energy-efficient appliances and gadgets is expected to save £150. Matthew Bell, chief executive of the committee, told the Guardian that he thought it was worth spending the money on climate policies. “The reason we’re acting to reduce our emissions is climate change poses real risks, real risks to the UK as well as round the world.”  The cost was relatively modest, he said, adding: “What our analysis says quite clearly is that as a proportion of total energy costs, climate costs are a small minority portion. The vast majority of your energy bill is accounted by other things, like wholesale costs and transmission costs.” Five of the big six energy suppliers have announced price hikes over the winter, sparking calls for a cap on bills.  Three energy companies outside of the major supplier group, including Bristol-based Ovo, which has 680,000 customers, and smaller suppliers Octopus and Utility Warehouse, signalled their support on Thursday for a relative price cap. The cap has been proposed by the Conservative MP John Penrose and would limit the gap between the best and worst deals on the market. About 50 MPs have backed a motion to be debated in parliament on Thursday, on the need to protect consumers on standard variable tariffs, which are the most common deal for British households. Some of the energy companies, such as German-owned E.ON, laid the blame for their rises partly on the cost of supporting green policies. But the Committee on Climate Change said that such policies had in fact shaved £290 a year off the average household energy bill between 2008 and 2016, because they had encouraged a shift to A-rated fridge freezers, condensing boilers and a swing away from incandescent lightbulbs to energy-saving ones. Bell said that future progress on more energy-efficient appliances was slowing slightly, but there was still potential for huge savings. “We’re still seeing only 1% of lighting being LEDs. And what we’ve not factored in at all is what IT will do for how we manage energy in our homes.” The committee said British households’ energy costs are not high compared to the rest of Europe. Residential electricity prices are below average, and gas prices the third lowest among 15 EU countries. Despite the government recently announcing a review into energy costs for businesses, the committee said climate policies were adding relatively little to companies’ bills and had not affected UK plc’s competitiveness.     Rebecca Williams, energy specialist at WWF, said: “This report shows that energy companies are wrong to blame the increase in energy bills solely on UK government policies. It is clear that the main driver here is rising fossil fuel costs.”"
"Spring is arriving ever earlier in the northern hemisphere. One sedge species in Greenland is springing to growth 26 days earlier than it did a decade ago. And in the US, spring arrived 22 days early this year in Washington DC. The evidence comes from those silent witnesses, the natural things that respond to climate signals. The relatively new science of phenology – the calendar record of first bud, first flower, first nesting behaviour and first migrant arrivals – has over the last three decades repeatedly confirmed meteorological fears of global warming as a consequence of the combustion of fossil fuels.  Researchers say the evidence from the plant world is consistent with the instrumental record: 2016 was the hottest year ever recorded, and it was the third record-breaking year in succession. Sixteen of the hottest years ever recorded have happened in the 21st century.   The most dramatic changes are observed in the high Arctic, the fastest-warming place on the planet, according to a study in Biology Letters. As the polar sea ice retreats, the growing season gets ever longer and arrives earlier. The pattern is not consistent: grey willow sticks to its original timetable, and dwarf birch growth has advanced about five days earlier for each decade. But the sedge, almost four weeks ahead of its timetable in a decade, holds the record, according to a study that observed one plot at a field site in west Greenland, 150 miles inland, for 12 years. “When we started studying this, I never would have imagined we’d be talking about a 26-day per decade rate of advance,” says Eric Post, a polar ecologist at the University of California, Davis, department of wildlife, fish and conservation biology, who has been studying the Arctic for 27 years. “That’s almost an entire growing season. That’s an eye-opening rate of change.” Caribou come to the study site during the calving season, to graze on the rich plant life of the brief Arctic summer. The caribou set their migration calendar by day-length. But some of the plants prefer to respond to temperature, which means that by the time the caribou arrive, the plants have flourished and the pickings are not as nutritious. So fewer calves are born and more die. “That’s one example of the consequences of this for consumer species like caribou, who have a limited window to build up resources before going into the next winter,” Post says. “With the most recent study, we’re taking a step towards understanding how extensive and cryptic the effects of sea ice loss might be in the Arctic.” Further south, spring keeps on springing, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS), which has just published a new set of maps based on phenological observations. And, once again, an early spring doesn’t mean a sunnier, kinder world for everybody. Ticks and mosquitoes become more active, pollen seasons last longer. Crops could flourish or be at risk from a sudden late frost or summer drought. Plants could bloom before the arrival of the birds, bees and butterflies that feed on and pollinate the flowers, with consequences for both the plant and the pollinator. “While these earlier springs might not seem like a big deal – and who among us doesn’t appreciate a balmy day or a break in dreary winter weather – they pose significant challenges for planning and managing important issues that affect our economy and our society,” says one of the authors of the report, Dr Jake Weltzin, a USGS ecologist and national director of the USA National Phenology Network."

"Maine laws protect people from discrimination based on factors such as race, disabilities and sexual orientation, and a Republican lawmaker wants to add a person’s beliefs about climate change to that list. State representative Larry Lockman has introduced a bill that would limit the state attorney general’s ability to investigate or prosecute people based on their political speech, including their views on climate change. It would also prohibit the state from making decisions on buying goods or services or awarding grants or contracts based on a person’s “climate change policy preferences”.  Lockman, an independent business consultant from Amherst, told the Associated Press that he believed it was an open question whether human activity is the primary cause of climate change.  Peer-reviewed studies, science organizations and climate scientists say that the world is warming from manmade forces. State representative Lois Galgay Reckitt, a Democrat of South Portland and a marine biologist who sits on the judiciary committee that has the bill, said prospects for passage are poor. She said she expected “the entire Democratic caucus is going to hate it”, and some Republicans will, too.  “The issue for me is I’m a scientist and I live near the ocean. It’s absolutely clear to me that climate change is happening, and it worries me,” she said. “I will fight this tooth and nail.”  Lockman wants to prohibit the state attorney general from investigating, joining an investigation or prosecuting any person based on that person’s protected political speech.  But he said his bill would reaffirm free speech by protecting climate change supporters as well.  “I don’t want to see a Republican state attorney general issuing subpoenas for the records of progressive or liberal thinktanks or public policy groups to chill their free speech,” he said.  The Democratic attorney general, Janet Mills, declined to comment.  In his bill, Lockman says that the supreme court’s decision in Citizens United “continued the protection of protected political speech, no matter the source or message”. That case allowed corporations and unions to make unlimited independent expenditures in US elections.  Jonathan Reisman, an associate professor of economics and public policy at the University of Maine at Machias and a vocal critic of the scientific consensus on climate change, said he requested the bill.  He said the bill is an attempt to defend the first amendment freedom of those who speak out in a way that does not reflect the consensus.  “It’s about Citizens United and the government abridging speech,” he said. “It’s not about climate science. It’s about climate policy.”  Lockman has a history of causing controversy. He once dressed as a vampire outside a federal building in Bangor to protest against the Internal Revenue Service. He also once accused liberals of assisting the Aids epidemic, saying they assured “the public that the practice of sodomy is a legitimate alternative lifestyle, rather than a perverted and depraved crime against humanity”. He said he could not predict the outcome of his latest bill but expected a lot of interest at a public hearing scheduled for 6 April.  Lockman’s bill is “absurd and unnecessary”, said Dylan Voorhees, climate and clean energy project director for the Natural Resources Council of Maine.  “Clearly an attempt to provide cover for climate deniers,” he said. “I see a trickle down from the Trump administration that has emboldened some folks to make climate denial statements.” "
"Installing solar panels on the roof of your home is a big project – but it can pay dividends in more ways than one. There’s the obvious environmental benefit, but for many homeowners, the joy comes with a dollar sign attached. Turning your home into a mini power plant can save you good money on the electric bill. Here is a guide to get you started.  An average, 5-kilowatt system will cost about $15,000 to $20,000, depending on where you live in the US. So it pays to find out if your state or utility offers rebates or other incentives to help lower the cost of going solar. Here is a sure bet: the federal government offers a 30% tax credit (though it’s set to decline starting in 2020).  You can start your research with this federally funded, comprehensive database that lists all sorts of incentives and policies for renewable energy by state. If that seems daunting, then begin your homework by contacting the state agency that regulates utilities.  Some states with strong policies to promote solar energy use, such as California, New York and Massachusetts, have created their own websites listing incentives, financing options and tips for hiring a contractor to install the solar panels. Your utility might offer a similar helpful guide. As with any major home improvement project, finding a good contractor is crucial. A trustworthy installer will secure the necessary permits, properly connect the solar energy system to your home and the local electric grid, and apply for incentives for you.  Some states – or local utilities – post a list of certified solar service companies. Many consumers ask friends and neighbors for recommendations. Googling works just as well. Regardless of the approach, you should always get several quotes and chat with the installers to find a good match.  Another big decision is how to pay for the equipment and services. You can pay for them outright, of course. A solar energy system lasts about 20 years, so paying for it upfront will be a cheaper option over time than to lease it. As an owner, you get a bonus incentive if you live in a state that allows you to sell excess solar electricity to your utility. The money you earn will show up as a credit on your bill.  Another popular option is to leave the ownership and maintenance of the solar panels to your installer (and its investors) and pay only for the electricity produced from the rooftop system. This arrangement is done through what’s commonly called a power purchase agreement, which can last 15 years or more. Your solar company typically sweetens the deal by charging you a lower electric rate than your utility would. Be sure to read the contract to see how your installer sets the electric rates over time. Those rates are likely to change. The solar energy market is growing because the average price for solar energy systems has fallen so much – 54% between 2010 and 2016, according to GTM Research. While your solar panels may not produce all the electricity you need, they are becoming a good investment to lower your bill. "
"Two members of the Climate Change Authority have resigned, with one accusing the government of being beholden to rightwing, anti-science “extremists” in its own party and in the media. John Quiggin told Guardian Australia he informed the federal minister for environment and energy, Josh Frydenberg, of his resignation on Thursday. It follows the resignation of fellow climate change authority member, Danny Price, who quit on Tuesday. “The government’s refusal to accept the advice of its own authority, despite wide support for that advice from business, environmental groups and the community as a whole, reflects the comprehensive failure of its policies on energy and the environment,” Quiggin said. “These failures can be traced, in large measure, to the fact that the government is beholden to rightwing anti-science activists in its own ranks and in the media. Rather than resist these extremists, the Turnbull government has chosen to treat the vital issues of climate change and energy security as an opportunity for political point-scoring and culture war rhetoric.” Quiggin said his immediate reason for resigning was the government’s failure to respond to the authority’s third report of the special review into potential climate policies, which the government had requested and which it was legally required to respond to. “The government has already indicated that it will reject the key recommendations of the review, particularly the introduction of an emissions intensity scheme for the electricity industry.” Quiggin said he didn’t believe there was anything to be gained “by giving objective advice based on science and economic analysis to a government dominated by elements hostile to both science and economics”.  Price told Guardian Australia he had resigned because he “didn’t think it was appropriate for a member of a government agency to be openly critical of government policy”. “I think the authority does really good work, but I didn’t think I could stay if I was going to continue to criticise the government’s policy making and I didn’t see any chance that it would get any better,” he said. “I really hate the complete ad hocery of it all … the idea that anything at all can be thrown out by a government in a political panic.” Quiggin was appointed to the authority in 2012, and Price in 2015. Both were appointed for five-year terms. The Climate Change Authority’s special review was undertaken last year, and recommended the government institute two emissions trading schemes and strengthen regulations if it was to meet Australia’s 2030 emission reduction targets.  The report was criticised by the Climate Institute, the Greens, and other climate groups and experts criticised elements of the report, and in August Guardian Australia revealed a split in the ranks of the authority, with three members writing a dissenting report. However many groups – including the Business Council of Australia, Energy Networks Australia, retailer Energy Australia, electricity provider AGL, the Climate Change Authority, the National Farmers Federation and the CSIRO – have also called for the introduction of an emissions intensity trading scheme. Frydenberg canvassed a trading scheme in December, but the the idea was dumped after three days following objections from senior ministers.   The government’s openness to a scheme has also been cited as a reason for Cory Bernardi’s resignation from the party in February. The Climate Change Authority was set up in 2011 as an independent statutory agency, and the Coalition has maintained that it should be abolished after failing to get its legislation to do just that through the Senate. Frydenberg told Guardian Australia: “the government thanks both Danny Price and John Quiggin for their service and the government will continue to engage constructively with the authority”. The Greens climate and energy spokesman, Adam Bandt, said the government’s “dangerous pandering to climate change deniers” had left it friendless. “When added to previous resignations, this exodus is the equivalent of half the reserve bank board resigning over the government’s economic policies.”"
"German scientists are switching on “the world’s largest artificial sun” in the hope that intense light sources can be used to generate climate-friendly fuel. The Synlight experiment in Jülich, about 19 miles west of Cologne, consists 149 souped-up film projector spotlights and produces light about 10,000 times the intensity of natural sunlight on Earth.  When all the lamps are swivelled to concentrate light on a single spot, the instrument can generate temperatures of around 3,500C – around two to three times the temperature of a blast furnace. “If you went in the room when it was switched on, you’d burn directly,” said Prof Bernard Hoffschmidt, a research director at the German Aerospace Center, where the experiment is housed in a protective radiation chamber. The aim of the experiment is to come up with the optimal setup for concentrating natural sunlight to power a reaction to produce hydrogen fuel. Solar power stations that use mirrors to focus sunlight onto water are already well established. These work by harnessing heat from the sun to produce steam that turns turbines and generates electricity.  The Synlight experiment is investigating the possibility that a similar setup could be used to power a reaction to extract hydrogen from water vapour, which could then be used as a fuel source for aeroplanes and cars. Synlight currently uses a vast amount of energy – four hours of operation consumes as much electricity as a four-person household in a year – but scientists hope that in the future natural sunlight could be used to produce hydrogen in a carbon-neutral way. “We’d need billions of tonnes of hydrogen if we wanted to drive aeroplanes and cars on CO2-free fuel,” said Hoffschmidt. “Climate change is speeding up so we need to speed up innovation.”"
"When it comes to coping with heatwaves, our own cities are conspiring against us. Road surfaces, pavements and buildings all contribute to keeping urbanised environments three to four degrees hotter than surrounding non-urbanised areas. With heatwaves like the ones that have just baked half of Australia to a crisp forecast to increase in frequency and intensity, city councils are taking the urban heat island effect very seriously.   “Some of the modelling studies have shown that we can often have an urban heat island magnitude – so that’s the difference between the temperature in the city versus the temperature in the non-urbanised surroundings – that can be greater than the types of temperature increases that we’re looking at with global warming,” says Dr Melissa Hart, graduate director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science at the University of New South Wales. The urban heat island effect occurs because the dense dark surfaces such as bitumen on roads and building materials used in cities accumulate and store heat during the day and then release it at night.  “That’s important, particularly during hot summer evenings; if the minimum temperatures are much warmer at night and not cooling down then that can have health implications,” Hart says. And those health implications are staggering: in 2009, 374 people died across metropolitan Melbourne in one heatwave: more than Victoria’s annual road toll.  One of the simplest solutions to reducing the urban heat island effect is to provide more shade, with trees.  In 2012 Melbourne city council launched an ambitious project to double the tree canopy cover from 22% to 40% by 2040, by planting about 3,000 new trees every year.  “On thermal images, you can see clearly the red hotspots of cities are streets, roads, carparks – wherever there is bitumen and concrete – and you can see the contrast with parks, garden and trees,” says councillor Cathy Oke, chair of Melbourne City council’s environment portfolio. But tree planting has its limitations: trees can’t be planted in the middle of roads, they can’t necessarily be planted on private property, and there are also potential issues with having too many trees. CSIRO’s Dr Simon Toze gives the example of some US cities that went overboard on tree planting and as a result, women felt less safe walking around the streets. “We want to make sure that what we do is not actually having a detrimental effect elsewhere,” says Toze, principal research scientist at CSIRO Land and Water’s Urban Living Lab, highlighting other issues such as water use and bushfire risk that can have implications for tree-planting efforts.  Another approach that can cut down on heat absorption is to consider different surface materials for roads and pavements.  As well as committing to a 50% increase in tree canopy cover by 2030, the city of Sydney has begun a trial of lighter-coloured pavement in one inner-city street to see if this will reduce temperatures by reducing heat absorption.  But lighter-coloured pavement can be a problem in very sunny areas. “On a bright day like today in Brisbane, the last thing you want is to be driving on the road with the sun coming down and bouncing off the pavement,” Toze says. “It’s a trade-off that we’ve got to work through.” One alternative is green roads with a more porous surface that allows water to seep in and even grass to grow through, which in turn cuts down the amount of heat absorbed by the road surface. Toze says it might be particularly useful for low-traffic areas that don’t see heavy vehicles, although he admits they are notorious for trapping women’s high heels. A similar principle to green roads applies to green roofs and green walls, where the building is partly or fully covered by vegetation. Sydney already has about 100 buildings with green roofs or green walls, including the award-winning One Central Park building on Broadway. This approach indirectly reduces urban heat by cooling the building itself and reducing its air-conditioning requirements, which in turn reduces the amount of waste heat released into the environment. But green roofs can also have unwanted side effects. “Some recent work coming out of our centre found that if you put green roofs on the rooftops all across Sydney you reduce the temperature but you can actually increase the humidity a little bit,” Hart says. “That can mean you’ve got a slight increase in heat stress because of the combined influence of temperature and humidity.” Contributors to the urban heat island effect and the potential solutions to it vary enormously from city to city, which is why modelling of individual cities is vital. What works in one city – like planting trees along the wide streets of the US city of Portland – is not going to be as effective or even as practical in the narrow street canyons of Hong Kong, Hart says. Their research on Sydney suggests the density and colour of building materials is one of the more significant contributors to the heat island effect. “This affects the amount of radiation from the sun that’s reflected straight back out rather than absorbed,” says Hart. “And so the simple matter of painting surfaces white or lighter colours, rather than the dark … can have a significant impact.” There’s another contributor that is less talked about, and that’s us. Our vehicles, the machinery we use to make our days more comfortable – such as air-conditioning and refrigeration – and even our own bodies produce significant amounts of heat. This anthropogenic heat is something Hart argues we need to understand and deal with.  “Obviously you can’t get rid of the people in a city but there are ways we can mitigate that,” she says. More public transport means fewer heat-producing cars on the roads.  Another issue is our over-reliance on air conditioning during hot periods. “If we’re building buildings that can deal with these conditions a little bit better than they currently do and we don’t have to rely on air-conditioning so much, then you’ve got less energy consumption and less waste heat.” There are no simple solutions, but ignoring the problem is definitely not an option, Oke says.  “The reality is that the climate is changing,[and] that cities that are already hot will get hotter,” she says. “The cooler we can make our city now, it’s an insurance policy for the future.”"
"Scott Pruitt, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, caused conniptions among scientists this week by claiming that carbon dioxide isn’t the primary catalyst of global warming. Conservative groups and industry, on the other hand, heard hints that a cherished goal may be within reach. In 2009 the EPA determined that greenhouse gas emissions “endanger both the public health and the public welfare of current and future generations”, opening the door to regulation. Donald Trump’s crusade against government strictures could target this finding, effectively making it official US policy that burning fossil fuels poses no threat to Americans, despite a mountain of scientific literature to the contrary.  “I suspect the president and his team are doing due diligence in this area and I’m hopeful they will request that the administrator reviews the endangerment finding,” said Tom Pyle, who served on Trump’s EPA transition team. The conservative American Energy Alliance questioned Trump on the finding before the election and elicited a promise that he would revisit the CO2 finding once in office. Pyle, who is president of the group, expects the administration to follow through. The EPA declined to comment.  “The president has worked diligently to fulfill his promises and I am confident he will do so,” Pyle said. “The Clean Air Act was abused by the previous administration to fit their agenda. It’s up to Congress to make a decision on CO2.” But even if the Trump administration shies away from a lengthy and bitterly opposed bid to repeal the finding, it’s clear that America’s environmental laws are undergoing the most radical shakeup since the 1970s. Rules around climate change, water pollution and vehicle fuel standards are all in the process of being redrawn. Coal, oil and gas companies are being ushered onto public land and waters. Areas of scientific research are set to be sidelined. “I think Scott Pruitt would have a hard time getting EPA staff to work on reversing the endangerment finding, he understands it would be a huge lift,” said Jeff Holmstead, a former EPA assistant administrator. “But you don’t need to do that to do away with the Clean Power Plan or revisit the car and truck standards.  Holmstead, who served under George W Bush, said that the Obama administration went “beyond what Congress intended”.  “We will see a return to the EPA’s core mission, we’ll see reforms of the approvals process so that it is faster and more predictable,” he said.   Trump has already signed measures that allow miners to dump waste into streams, and that facilitate the controversial Keystone XL and Dakota Access oil pipelines. The Clean Water Act, which Obama used to expand protections for the drinking water of 117 million Americans, is also being reviewed to “evaluate whether it is stifling economic growth or job creation”.  The administration is now expected to turn its attention to unravelling the Clean Power Plan, reportedly without a replacement. The plan, a centerpiece Obama-era climate policy, sets emissions limits on coal-fired power plants and is currently being challenged in court by over a dozen Republican-controlled states. The Trump administration may drop the legal defense of the plan.  New fuel standards, which require cars built from 2017 are able to run 54.5 miles per gallon, are also set to be reviewed. Pruitt, who has previously railed against the EPA’s “activist agenda” meddling in state’s rights, could even move to prevent states such as California exceeding minimum federal standards for fuel efficiency.  The White House, following Trump’s lead that the EPA should be reduced to “tidbits”, wants to slash the regulator’s budget by 25%, laying off one in five staff. While the final budget is likely to be less severe, critics have noted that the proposed cuts land heaviest on minority and low-income communities. The cuts would effectively dismantle the office of environmental justice, help for Alaskan villages, and programs for support for minority-owned small businesses and climate adaptation.  “These cuts would have a devastating impact upon the health of tens of millions of people across the country,” said Bill Becker, executive director of the National Association of Clean Air Agencies.  “The brunt of these cuts will be borne by people’s hearts and lungs and disproportionately effect those in the major metropolitan areas and those who are poor and can’t fend for themselves. I hope I’m wrong but I don’t see this budget changing that much.”  Mustafa Ali, who worked on environmental justice issues for the EPA since 1992, resigned from the regulator last week. “Doing this work for almost 25 years, I’ve seen a lot of people get sick and die,” Ali said. “I hope the new administration will step up and prioritize environmental justice concerns but to date I’ve not seen that commitment.”  “They are sending the signal that they don’t value the lives of communities of color, low income communities and tribal people,” he added. “There are astronomical rates of asthma among people of color, in some places it’s devastating communities.”  Other environmental agencies face similar futures. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) has been lined up for a 17% budget cut, mostly in climate data and the elimination of several smaller programs, such as Sea Grant, which prepares coastal communities for storms, sea level rise and altered fishing conditions. Jane Lubchenco, a former Noaa administrator for Obama, said the cuts would be “devastating to the economy, jobs and to the safety and livelihoods of Americans in every state”.  But after years of skepticism and investigations into supposed malpractice by Noaa, Congressional Republicans have started agitating for Nasa’s Earth science budget to be redeployed for deep space exploration, threatening the nation’s other home for climate research. The proposed cuts fall in line with an ethos that treats climate change, at best, as a boutique environmental issue that drains public funds and stifles business. Trump has promised to “unleash” a new wave of oil and gas drilling, and to revitalize the ailing coal industry, largely with its plan to cut environmental regulations.  A three-year moratorium on coal mining on federal land is expected to be lifted by Ryan Zinke, the new interior secretary, who after riding a horse into work on his first day promptly signed an order to expand access to public lands.   The zeal for deregulation across the new administration has been decried by environmentalists as a recipe for fossil fuel cronyism, runaway climate change and toxic water crises like the one seen in Flint, Michigan. But proponents claim that the environment can still thrive without regulations.  “All these doomsday scenarios won’t come to fruition,” Pyle said, calling it a “silly straw man” to accuse Obama critics of apathy toward the environment.   “I have kids, I take them camping. I don’t want them to get asthma,” he said. “You can be for the environment and not be for the way the previous administration abused the regulatory process.”"
"Former Treasury secretary Ken Henry has blasted Australia’s federal political leaders saying the reform agenda has been buried by the politics of fear and anger. He urged Australian business to fill the leadership vacuum, saying if companies wanted greater certainty they would have to start delivering it themselves. In a caustic speech at the National Press Club on Thursday, Henry decried the state of climate change policy, saying it was “quite extraordinary” how shambolic it was when our politicians had been told – at least 14 years ago – that there was an urgent need to develop long-term policies to address carbon emissions. He said the biggest challenge confronting the energy sector was that climate change policy in Australia was a “shambles.” He said political leaders were told years ago that there was an urgent need to address the crisis in business confidence. “It is quite extraordinary, but nevertheless true, that things are very much worse today,” he said. “Topics that we have traditionally assumed to be in the domain of public policy, and not the stuff of business, are going to have to become our constant preoccupation,” he said. “The leadership task is urgent.” The now-NAB chairman told an audience of business and political leaders that Australians used to be proud of a country that pioneered world’s-best policy and nurtured leading institutions: “But nobody any longer looks to Australia to see how it should be done,” he said. He wondered why consecutive federal governments had even bothered commissioning important reports – such as four intergenerational reports over the past 15 years – when they then ignored them. Henry criticised modern political parties for digging themselves into “deep trenches” from which they fired insults, with “populism supplying the munitions,” saying the country that Australians want “cannot even be imagined from these trenches.” “Today’s dysfunction stands in marked contrast to earlier periods of policy success – where politics was adversarial, every bit as partisan – but when the tribal tensions within parties were generally well-managed and the political contest appeared to energise policy, not kill it,” he said. It was Henry’s most scathing public assessment of the state of politics since he left Treasury in 2011. His speech followed a few months in which blackouts in South Australia pushed energy security and climate change policy to centre-stage politically. Malcolm Turnbull was criticised in September for linking the SA blackout to the state’s use of renewable energy by calling the blackout a “wake-up call” for state leaders who were trying to meet “completely unrealistic” renewable targets. Labor was recently pilloried for being unable to explain clearly its own renewable energy target. Henry said there were four policy challenges demanding immediate attention, including: budget repair; the need to plan for an ageing population; the need for a settled policy framework for climate change mitigation and energy security; and to ensure we make the most of the Asian century. On the federal budget, he said the government had utterly failed to reduce the deficit and spending: “Australia’s current tax system was designed to achieve a reduction in the size of government over time, forcing spending below the average 24.1% of GDP recorded by the Howard government. But that hasn’t happened. “While payments were at 24.1% of GDP in 2012-13, the most recent MYEFO reveals that they had risen to 25.6% of GDP by 2015-16, and are projected to be 25.2% of GDP from 2016-17 out to 2019-20.  “According to the most recent budget, payments will then rise further, partly as a consequence of population ageing. “This is bigger government, not smaller government. And bigger government must be paid for.” Henry said Australia needed a minimum set of long-overdue reforms, including: “Of course, I have no confidence that this list of urgent and essential reforms will be achieved by today’s parliaments,” he said. “In recent months, the National Australia Bank has surveyed our business customers and the broader community about their attitudes to Australia. “While 90% of the Australians we surveyed consider Australia to be a great place to live today, only half think it will still be a great place a decade from now,” he said."
"The depletion of oxygen in our oceans threatens future fish stocks and risks altering the habitat and behaviour of marine life, scientists have warned, after a new study found oceanic oxygen levels had fallen by 2% in 50 years. The study, carried out at Geomar Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research in Germany, was the most comprehensive of the subject to date. The fall in oxygen levels has been attributed to global warming and the authors warn that if it continues unchecked, the amount of oxygen lost could reach up to 7% by 2100. Very few marine organisms are able to adapt to low levels of oxygen.    The paper contains analysis of wide-ranging data from 1960 to 2010, documenting changes in oxygen distribution in the entire ocean for the first time. “Since large fish in particular avoid or do not survive in areas with low oxygen content, these changes can have far-reaching biological consequences,” said Dr Sunke Schmidtko, the report’s lead author.  Some areas have seen a greater drop than others. The Pacific – the planet’s largest ocean – has suffered the greatest volume of oxygen loss, while the Arctic witnessed the sharpest decline by percentage. “While the slight decrease of oxygen in the atmosphere is currently considered non-critical, the oxygen losses in the ocean can have far-reaching consequences because of the uneven distribution,” added another of the report’s authors, Lothar Stramma. It is increasingly clear that the heaviest burden of climate change is falling on the planet’s oceans, which absorb more than 30% of the carbon produced on land. Rising sea levels are taking their toll on many of the world’s poorest places. Warming waters have devastated corals – including the Great Barrier Reef – in bleaching events.  Acidic oceans, caused by a drop in PH levels as carbon is absorbed, threaten creatures’ ability to build their calcium-based shells and other structures. Warming waters have also caused reproductive problems in species such as cod, and triggered their migration to colder climates. Lower oxygen levels in larger parts of the ocean are expected to force animals to seek out ever shrinking patches of habitable water, with significant impacts on the ecosystem and food web. Callum Roberts, the author of Ocean of Life and a marine conservation biologist at the University of York, is unsurprised by the latest findings. “What we’re seeing is fallout from global warming,” he says. “It’s straightforward physics and chemistry playing out in front of our eyes, entirely in keeping with what we’d expect and yet another nail in coffin of climate change denial.”  Scientists have long predicted ocean deoxygenation due to climate change, but confirmation on this global scale, and at deep sea level, is concerning them. Last year, Matthew Long, an oceanographer at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Colorado, predicted that oxygen loss would become evident “across large regions of the oceans” between 2030 and 2040. Reacting to the German findings, Long said it was “alarming to see this signal begin to emerge clearly in the observational data”, while Roberts said, “We now have a measurable change which is attributable to global warming.” The report explains that the ocean’s oxygen supply is threatened by global warming in two ways. Warmer water is less able to contain oxygen than cold, so as the oceans warm, oxygen is reduced. Warmer water is also less dense, so the oxygen-rich surface layer cannot easily sink and circulate.  “As the world warms up, the thickness and temperature of the surface layers are increasing,” said Roberts. “This acts like a stronger lid on the world’s oceans, so there’s less oxygen transported down below.”    “Unless we address greenhouse gas emissions urgently we’ll see more and more of this,” said Roberts. “Life will become harder for creatures that live in the sea and for those that depend on them – ie us.”  Fish that rely on dissolved oxygen will grow more slowly, peak at a smaller body size, and produce fewer offspring. And, Roberts pointed out, larger fish such as tuna, swordfish and sharks will be badly affected given their greater dependence on larger amounts of oxygen – they will be driven into ever narrower bands of oxygen-rich water near the surface, as will much of their prey, leading to more competition for food sources and other changed behaviour.  One knock-on effect is likely to be an increase to overfishing: “The eastern Pacific has huge tuna fisheries already,” he pointed out. “If the tuna can’t dive down where it is uninhabitable, as oxygen deficient areas expand, they have less space at the surface, they’re squeezed into ever tighter spaces and they’re more vulnerable to being caught.”  "

"One of the worst instances of mangrove forest dieback recorded globally struck Australia’s Gulf of Carpentaria in the summer of 2015-16. A combination of extreme temperatures, drought and lowered sea levels likely caused this dieback, according to our investigation published in the journal Marine and Freshwater Research. The dieback, which coincided with the Great Barrier Reef’s worst recorded bleaching event, affected 1,000km of coastline between the Roper river in the Northern Territory and Karumba in Queensland. About 7,400 hectares, or 6%, of the gulf’s mangrove forest had died. Losses were most severe in the NT, where around 5,500ha of mangroves suffered dieback. Some of the gulf’s many catchments, such as the Robinson and McArthur rivers, lost up to 26% of their mangroves. The Gulf of Carpentaria is a continuous sweep of wide tidal wetlands fringed by mangroves, meandering estuaries, creeks and beaches. Its size and naturalness makes it globally exceptional. An apron of broad mudflats and seagrass meadows supports thousands of marine turtles and dugongs. A thriving fishing industry worth at least $30m ultimately depends on mangroves. Mangroves and saltmarsh plants are uniquely adapted to extreme and fickle coastal shoreline ecosystems. They normally cope with salt and daily inundation, having evolved specialised physiological and morphological traits, such as salt excretion and unique breathing roots. But in early 2016, local tour operators and consultants doing bird surveys alerted authorities to mangroves dying en masse along entire shorelines. They reported skeletonised mangroves over several hundred kilometres, with the trees appearing to have died simultaneously. They sent photos and even tracked down satellite images to confirm their concerns. The NT government supported the first investigative surveys in June 2016. In the end, the emails from citizen scientists nailed the timing: “looks like it started maybe December 2015”; the severity: “I’ve seen dieback before, but not like this”; and the cause: “guessing it may be the consequence of the four-year drought”. Our investigation used satellite imagery dating back to 1972 to confirm that the dieback was an unparalleled event. Further aerial helicopter surveys and mapping during 2016, after the dieback, validated the severity of the event extending across the entire gulf. Mangrove dieback has been recorded in Australia in the past but over decades, not months. We still don’t fully understand what caused the dieback. But we can rule out the usual suspects of chemical or oil spills, or severe storm events. It was also significant that losses occurred simultaneously across a 1,000km front. There were also a number of tell-tale patterns in the dieback. The worst-impacted locations had more or less complete loss of shoreline-fringing mangroves. This mirrored a general loss of mangroves fringing tidal saltpans and saltmarshes along this semi-arid coast. Mangroves were unaffected where they kept their feet wet along estuaries and rivers. This, as well as the timing and severity of the event, points to a connection with extreme weather and climate patterns, and particularly the month-long drop of 20cm in local sea levels. We believe the dieback is best explained by drought, hot water, hot air and the temporary drop in sea level. Each of these was correlated with the strong 2015-16 El Niño. Let’s take a look at each in turn. First, the dieback happened at the end of an unusually long period of severe drought conditions, which prevailed for much of 2015 following four years of below-average rainfall. This caused severe moisture stress in mangroves growing alongside saltmarsh and saltpans. Second, the dieback coincided with hot sea temperatures that also caused coral bleaching along the Great Barrier Reef. While mangroves are known to be relatively heat-tolerant, they have their limits. The air temperatures recorded at the time of the mangrove dieback, particularly from February to September 2015, were also exceptionally high. Third, the sea level dropped by up to 20cm at the time of the dieback when the mangroves were both heat- and moisture-stressed. Sea levels commonly drop in the western Pacific (and rise in the eastern Pacific) during strong El Niño years: and the 2015-16 El Niño was the third-strongest recorded. The mangroves appear to have died of thirst. Mangroves may be hardy plants, but when sea levels drop, reducing inundation, coupled with already heat- and drought-stressed weather conditions, then the plants will die – much like your neglected pot plants. We don’t yet know what role human-caused climate change played in these particular weather events or El Niño. But the unprecedented extent of the dieback, the confluence of extreme climate events and the coincidence with the bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef mean the role of climate change will be of critical interest in the global response to mangrove decline. The future for mangroves around the world is mixed. Thanks to climate change, droughts are expected to become hotter and more frequent. If the gulf’s mangroves experience further dieback in the future, this will have serious implications for Australia’s northern fisheries including the prawn fishery, mudcrab and fin fish fisheries. All species are closely associated with healthy mangroves. We don’t know whether the mangroves will recover or not. But there is now a further risk of shoreline erosion and retreat, particularly if the region is struck by a cyclone – and this may have already begun with recent cyclonic weather and flooding in the gulf. The movement of mangrove sediments will lead to massive releases of carbon uniquely buried among their roots. Mangroves are among the most carbon-rich forests in the tropics and semi-tropics and much of this carbon could enter the atmosphere. Now we urgently need to understand how mangroves died at large and smaller scales (such as river catchments), so we can develop strategies to help them adapt to future change. • This article has been republished from the Conversation.

"A giant pension scheme with more than 4 million members is shifting almost 10% of its investments into a new climate change fund designed to move people’s money out of fossil fuels and into renewable energy. Nest (National Employment Savings Trust), a publicly owned scheme set up by the government, said it was moving £130m into the fund because it wanted to protect its worker members from the risks associated with climate change by reducing their exposure to companies with reserves of coal, oil and gas.  Nest has named oil groups Shell and ExxonMobil as two of the companies in which it is set to scale back its investment, with SSE, one of Britain’s biggest energy firms, one of those likely to be a beneficiary of the new strategy. The move has been welcomed by climate change campaigners and comes amid an ongoing global carbon divestment campaign that has succeeded in persuading hundreds of institutions, including universities, pension funds and charitable foundations, to dump billions of pounds of shares in carbon-intensive industries. The Guardian has been running its own campaign called Keep it in the ground. The move by Nest is notable because it is a public body – it was set up by the government to help employers meet their obligations under the automatic enrolment retirement saving initiative, which went live in 2012. Nest is now looking after the pension pots of more than 4 million UK workers, investing £1.5bn on their behalf, and has signed up more than 290,000 employers. These numbers are expected to increase markedly over the next few years, making Nest a major shareholder and, it hopes, a difficult voice to ignore. Most of the money looked after by Nest is invested in its retirement date funds – there are 47 of these, with each worker put into the one appropriate for their age. It is £130m of this total pot that is being moved into a new “climate-aware” fund managed by UBS Asset Management, which has been developed to allow members to “benefit from the transition to a low-carbon economy”. However, Nest is not describing this as a divestment strategy because it is not pulling all of its funds out of oil, gas and coal companies. Instead, it will apply a positive “tilt” that will increase investment in companies identified as vital to combating climate change, such as those working on renewable energy or those that are making the necessary changes to adapt to a lower-carbon future. At the same time it will reduce investment in companies that are heavy carbon emitters, have fossil fuel reserves or are not making the sorts of changes needed to meet emission reduction targets. The focus will also be on engagement, to encourage companies to improve and future-proof their business models. A Nest spokeswoman said: “This move sends a strong message to companies Nest invests in that it expects to see measurable progress towards environmental sustainability.” The plan is that younger workers will have greater exposure to the new fund than older members because it is the former who are more likely to be impacted by the move to a lower-carbon economy. Mark Fawcett, chief investment officer of Nest, said: “As responsible long-term investors on behalf of our members, we can’t afford to ignore climate change risks, and we’ve committed to being part of the solution.” Sectors where Nest/UBS will be investing less than they would otherwise include mining, oil and gas, beverages, aerospace and defence, travel and leisure, and food production. Companies where they expect to “dial down” investment include Shell, ExxonMobil and fellow oil company Chevron, plus BHP Billiton, the world’s biggest mining firm. SSE is one of the companies where Nest is likely to increase its investment. In the first six months of 2016-17, SSE invested around £125m in renewable generation and aims to reduce the carbon intensity of its overall electricity generation by 50% between 2006 and 2020."
"Several highly publicized campaigns are taking place to save the data maintained by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from becoming inaccessible to the public under the Trump administration. “There is no reason to think the data is safe,” says Gretchen Goldman, research director at the Center for Science and Democracy, a program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “The administration, so far, hasn’t given any indication it will respect science and scientific data, especially when it’s inconvenient to its policy agendas.” That data, kept in dozens of databases, represents decades of monitoring the American environment in fine detail.

"On February 16, the Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center hosted a film screening of the “Rational Middle Energy Series.” The university promoted the event as “Finding Energy’s Rational Middle” and described the film’s motivation as “a need and desire for a balanced discussion about today’s energy issues.”  Who can argue with balance and rationality? And with Harvard’s stamp of approval, surely the information presented to students and the public would be credible and reliable. Right?   Wrong. The event’s sponsor was Shell Oil Company. The producer of the film series was Shell. The film’s director is Vice President of a family-owned oil and gas company, and has taken approximately $300,000 from Shell. The host, Harvard Kennedy School, has received at least $3.75 million from Shell. And the event’s panel included a Shell Executive Vice President.  The film “The Great Transition” says natural gas is “clean” (in terms of carbon emissions, it is not) and that low-carbon, renewable energy is a “very long time off” (which is a political judgment, not a fact). Amy Myers Jaffe, identified in the film as the Executive Director of Energy and Sustainability at the University of California, Davis, says, “We need to be realistic that we’re gonna use fossil fuels now, because in the end, we are.” We are not told that she is a member of the US National Petroleum Council.  The film also features Richard Newell, who is identified as a Former Administrator at the US Energy Information Administration. “You can get 50% reductions in your emissions relative to coal through natural gas,” he says, ignoring the methane leaks that undermine such claims. The film neglects to mention that the Energy Initiative Newell founded and directed at Duke University was given $4 million by an Executive Vice President of a natural gas company.  Michelle Michot Foss, who offers skepticism about battery production for renewables, is identified as the Chief Energy Economist at the Center for Energy Economics at the University of Texas at Austin. What’s not said is that the Energy Institute she founded at UT Austin is funded by Chevron, ExxonMobil, and other fossil fuel interests including the Koch Foundation, or that she’s a partner in a natural gas company. You may notice a pattern. The very experts we assume to be objective, and the very centers of research we assume to be independent, are connected with the very industry the public believes they are objectively studying. Moreover, these connections are often kept hidden.  To say that these experts and research centers have conflicts of interest is an understatement: many of them exist as they do only because of the fossil fuel industry. They are industry projects with the appearance of neutrality and credibility given by academia. After years conducting energy-related research at Harvard and MIT, we have come to discover firsthand that this pattern is systemic. Funding from Shell, Chevron, BP, and other oil and gas companies dominates Harvard’s energy and climate policy research, and Harvard research directors consult for the industry. These are the experts tasked with formulating policies for countering climate change, policies that threaten the profits – indeed the existence – of the fossil fuel industry. Down the street at MIT, the Institute’s Energy Initiative is almost entirely funded by fossil fuel companies, including Shell, ExxonMobil, and Chevron. MIT has taken $185 million from oil billionaire and climate denial financier David Koch, who is a Life Member of the university’s board. The trend continues at Stanford, where one of us now works. The university’s Global Climate and Energy Project is funded by ExxonMobil and Schlumberger. The Project’s founding director is a petroleum engineer, and its current director is a reservoir engineer. Its current director also co-directs Stanford’s Precourt Institute for Energy, which is named after (and was co-founded by) the CEO of a natural gas company (now owned by Shell). Across the bay, UC Berkeley’s Energy Biosciences Institute is the product of a $500 million deal with BP – one that gives the company power over which research projects get funded and which don’t. Fossil fuel interests – oil, gas, and coal companies, fossil-fueled utilities, and fossil fuel investors - have colonized nearly every nook and cranny of energy and climate policy research in American universities, and much of energy science too. And they have done so quietly, without the general public’s knowledge. For comparison, imagine if public health research were funded predominantly by the tobacco industry. It doesn’t take a neurosurgeon to understand the folly of making policy or science research financially dependent on the very industry it may regulate or negatively affect. Harvard’s school of public health no longer takes funding from the tobacco industry for that very reason. Yet such conflicts of interest are not only rife in energy and climate research, they are the norm.  This norm is no accident: it is the product of a public relations strategy to neutralize science and target those whom ExxonMobil dubbed “Informed Influentials,” and it comes straight out of Big Tobacco’s playbook. The myriad benefits of this strategy to the fossil fuel industry (and its effects on academic research) range from benign to insidious to unconscionable, but the big picture is simple: academia has a problem. As scientists and policy experts rush to find solutions to the greatest challenge humanity has ever faced, our institutions are embroiled in a nationwide conflict of interest with the industry that has the most to lose. Our message to universities is: stop ignoring it. We are not saying that universities must cut all ties with all fossil fuel companies. Energy research is so awash with fossil fuel funding that such a proposal would imply major changes. What we are saying is that denial – “I don’t see a conflict,” MIT’s Chairman told the Boston Globe – is no longer acceptable. Two parallel approaches can help. First, mandatory standards should be established in climate policy and energy research for disclosing financial and professional ties with fossil fuel interests, akin to those required in medical research. And second, conflicts of interest should be reduced by prioritizing less conflicted funding and personnel. One way or another, the colonization of academia by the fossil fuel industry must be confronted. Because when our nation’s “independent” research to stop climate change is in fact dependent on an industry whose interests oppose that goal, neither the public nor the future is well served.

"On 30 June, after almost 12 years – seven more than originally planned – the Climate Institute will close its doors. As its CEO for the last decade, this has given me pause to reflect on this rollercoaster ride through the bumpy minefield that is Australian climate and energy politics. Where have we been as a nation? What has the Climate Institute contributed? And, where are we headed?  Because, while the politics sometimes smells like it did back when the institute began, the context within which it now operates is vastly different. The toxic politics and short termism which seeks to make climate change a proxy issue for ideological and political wars, rather than one of risk management, is simply unsustainable. We were very fortunate that the Climate Institute was established with a visionary philanthropic bequest to carry out research and non-partisan advocacy on the vital issue of climate policy. It enabled us to work with a broad spectrum of business, political and social and environmental stakeholders – as both a trusted broker and a “critical friend”, providing solid evidence and workable solutions. I – we – believe climate change is too important to be bogged down in trenches of culture or partisan wars. Or indeed trenches that make the perfect the enemy of the good. For me, the irony is that the closure of the Climate Institute – in its current form at least – comes just as we have helped build an unprecedented consensus on the need for good, credible climate policy. More and more key stakeholders are emerging up and out of the trenches, recognising that it’s actually a matter of risk management and assessing the benefits of action. If that seems like a bold statement, Exhibit A is a front page story in the Australian. In a sublimely ironic piece of timing, the paper highlights that the uncertainty generated by the squabbling of this last lost decade has had a cost impact of more than double the price of Julia Gillard’s “carbon tax”. This, of course, is without the household support from the carbon revenue that more than offsets the cost of living impacts of the carbon price. Unfortunately that support couldn’t cover the costs of new poles and wires which mostly accounted for the electricity price rises of the time, and it couldn’t stave off the opportunistic political scare campaigns that were its eventual undoing. We are now paying the price of an increasingly brittle electricity system which is threatening our economic prosperity, job security and those three words – cost of living. The Australian’s story draws on statements by industry groups and companies with skin in the game – big carbon emitters and big energy users – have all called for better stable, credible long-term climate policy measures, like including market-based mechanisms and long-term targets. Every credible stakeholder realises this is needed to provide the certainty necessary for investment in our long-term energy and industry needs. Building partnerships among business, investor and community groups that can help move this debate out of the trenches has been core business for the Climate Institute in recent years. The Australian Climate Roundtable, which brings together business, social, union and environmental groups; and a joint statement by CEOs of some of the country’s biggest companies calling for bipartisan energy and climate policy are recent important examples we’ve helped facilitate. Many, but not all, have realised that this means a net zero emissions economy – before 2050 – and that the sooner we start planning for that, the more secure and affordable the electricity system can be. This is being accelerated by two other mega trends. Firstly the Paris Agreement is a mechanism of ongoing accountability. It is built on the basis that nations are re-assessing their national interest and recognising this is to be found in clean energy and climate action. Most nations, and investors, now realise that unless investments help build a net zero emissions economy by 2050, they will be at risk. Company directors face this too. President Trump won’t change it. Secondly, the technology alternatives are now increasingly affordable. Perhaps, most ironically, they are increasingly the only solutions that can be built at the speed and scale necessary to solve the crisis caused by the squabbling of the last decade. The change is evident at the very heart of our financial system, where there is an awakening that the long term is not made up by a series of short terms - we can and must plan ahead to avoid what the Central Bank of England Governor Mark Carney calls the “tragedy of the horizons”. The recent speech from the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority, highlighting that climate risk is a real issue here and now for all our financial institutions, was a watershed. That speech was one of my top 10 days of the last decade! Over that decade we have also tracked Australians attitudes to climate change and its solutions through our Climate of the Nation series. Support for renewable energy has been strong and strengthening throughout – because people see this as one of the few economic pathways ahead. While support for climate action did suffer during the scare campaign, our research, and that of Lowy and others, shows a steady recovery from the start of the carbon price and the realisation that the sky did not fall in. There has also been much-appreciated support from donors and businesses that enabled the Climate Institute to continue with our mission. We’ve had some great backers who’ve stuck with us through thick and thin. Unfortunately this sort of advocacy can be seen as somewhat unsexy work. Its impact can be hard to assess. I can understand those that like to fund the fighters rather than back the bridge builders. The result is that we haven’t been able to achieve the scale of support necessary to continue. My hope is that philanthropists will realise that centrist advocacy, which we have pursued, has a rightful place in a mixed portfolio of support for the transition Australia can and must make – which science and international commitments have all indicated is the necessary goal – to a zero emissions economy by 2050 – a fair, clean, safe, but prosperous one.

"New South Wales, which has just experienced its hottest summer on record, is 50 times more likely to experience another similarly hot summer and 10 times more likely to experience extremely hot days under climate change, according to a group of Australian climate scientists. The mean temperature in Sydney was 2.8C above average in December, January, and February, according to the Bureau of Meteorology, and the three-day heatwave from 9 February to 11 was the hottest on record from Sydney to Brisbane, breaking records set in 1939. It us the kind of weather event that would have been considered a one in 500-year occurrence before 1910, before global warming had a significant impact on the climate system, but had now become a one in 50-year event, according to a new analysis released on Thursday. “In the future, a summer as hot as this past summer in NSW is likely to happen roughly once every five years,” the report said. It could make Sydney a less liveable city, one of the report’s authors, Dr Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick, said. Perkins-Kirkpatrick is a research fellow at the University of New South Wales’ Climate Change Research Centre and said Sydney was unprepared for the knock-on effects of a significant increase in average summer temperatures. “I grew up in Sydney, so I’m kind of partial to it, and we are actually starting to think, well, can we live here?” she said. “To live here it’s going to take a lot more preparation that what we are used to, looking at the building codes, including things like full insulation and double-glazing. Sydney should start having these discussions now because that sort of situation is just going to occur a lot more often.” Energy regulators warned last month that the electricity network was not equipped to supply enough power to cover the demand from air conditioners in Sydney for the the heatwave on 9 to 11 February. At the same time the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, doubled down on comments linking a large blackout following storms in South Australia last year to renewable energy, against the advice of his department, saying it was a matter of “energy security” and a “wake-up call” for state governments trying to hit “completely unrealistic” renewable energy targets. Perkins-Kirkpatrick said it was “extremely frustrating” to hear that debate in the face of the long-term climate data. “I think people expect something to happen to encourage the to make this change, and that’s the problem – there hasn’t been that encouragement from higher powers to say, ‘ok, we are going to do something now’,” she said. “It’s very, very frustrating that people who can help the situation and can give us a cleaner and a better energy source are not talking about it.”  Melbourne University’s Dr Andrew King, another author of the report, said that while Australia had experienced extremely hot days or extreme weather events in the past, the data showed the frequency and severity of those events had increased markedly in the past 20 years and would continue to increase unless drastic action was taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. “Yes, people would have experienced 40C days several decades ago around different parts of Australia and in Sydney but we know that these incidences of very hot days are getting more frequent and we are setting more records for heat,” he said. Australia broke 12 times more records for hot weather than cool weather between 2000 and 2014.  “The purpose of the analysis in this report is to raise awareness that climate change is already impacting on weather in Australia,” King said. “Hopefully it motivates action on climate change, because we know what the solution to climate change is.”"
"For thousands of years, parts of northwest Europe have enjoyed a climate about 5C warmer than many other regions on the same latitude. But new scientific analysis suggests that that could change much sooner and much faster than thought possible. Climatologists who have looked again at the possibility of major climate change in and around the Atlantic Ocean, a persistent puzzle to researchers, now say there is an almost 50% chance that a key area of the North Atlantic could cool suddenly and rapidly, within the space of a decade, before the end of this century.  That is a much starker prospect than even the worst-case scientific scenario proposed so far, which does not see the Atlantic ocean current shutdown happening for several hundred years at least. A scenario even more drastic (but fortunately fictional) was the subject of the 2004 US movie The Day After Tomorrow, which portrayed the disruption of the North Atlantic’s circulation leading to global cooling and a new Ice Age. To evaluate the risk of extreme climate change, researchers from the Environnements et Paléoenvironnements Océaniques et Continentaux laboratory (CNRS/University of Bordeaux, France), and the University of Southamptondeveloped an algorithm to analyse the 40 climate models considered by the Fifth Assessment Report. The findings by the British and French team, published in the Nature Communications journal, in sharp contrast to the IPCC, put the probability of rapid North Atlantic cooling during this century at almost an even chance – nearly 50%. Current climate models foresee a slowing of the meridional overturning circulation (MOC), sometimes known also as the thermohaline circulation, which is the phenomenon behind the more familiar Gulf Stream that carries warmth from Florida to European shores. If it did slow, that could lead to a dramatic, unprecedented disruption of the climate system. In 2013, drawing on 40 climate change projections, the IPCC judged that this slowdown would occur gradually, over a long period. Its findings suggested that fast cooling of the North Atlantic during this century was unlikely. But oceanographers from EU emBRACE had also re-examined the 40 projections by focusing on a critical spot in the northwest of the North Atlantic: the Labrador Sea. The Labrador Sea is host to a convection system ultimately feeding into the ocean-wide MOC. The temperatures of its surface waters plummet in the winter, increasing their density and causing them to sink. This displaces deep waters, which bring their heat with them as they rise to the surface, preventing the formation of ice caps. The algorithm developed by the Anglo-French researchers was able to detect quick sea surface temperature variations. With it they found that seven of the 40 climate models they were studying predicted a total shutdown of convection, leading to abrupt cooling of the Labrador Sea by 2C to 3C over less than 10 years. This in turn would drastically lower North Atlantic coastal temperatures. But because only a handful of the models supported this projection, the researchers focused on the critical parameter triggering winter convection: ocean stratification. Five of the models that included stratification predicted a rapid drop in North Atlantic temperatures.  The researchers say these projections can one day be tested against real data from the international OSnap project, whose teams will be anchoring scientific instruments within the sub-polar gyre (a gyre is any large system of circulating ocean currents). If the predictions are borne out and the North Atlantic waters do cool rapidly over the coming years, the team says, with considerable understatement, climate change adaptation policies for regions bordering the North Atlantic will have to take account of this phenomenon."
"The UK’s carbon dioxide emissions have fallen to their lowest level since the 19th century as coal use continues to plummet, analysis suggests.  Emissions of the major greenhouse gas fell almost 6% year on year in 2016, after the use of coal for electricity more than halved to record lows, according to the Carbon Brief website, which reports on climate science and energy policy.  The assessment suggests carbon emissions in 2016 were about 381m tonnes, putting the UK’s carbon pollution at its lowest level – apart from during coal mining disputes in the 1920s – since 1894.  Carbon emissions in 2016 are about 36% below the reference year of 1990, against which legal targets to cut climate pollution are measured.  Emissions of carbon dioxide from coal fell 50% in 2016 as use of the fossil fuel dropped by 52%, contributing to an overall drop in carbon output of 5.8% last year compared with 2015, Carbon Brief said.  The assessment reveals that coal use has fallen by 74% in just a decade.  UK coal demand is falling rapidly because of cheaper gas, a hike in carbon taxes on the highly polluting fuel, expansion of renewables, dropping demand for energy overall and the closure of Redcar steelworks in late 2015.  Three coal-fired power stations closed in 2016 – Longannet in Fife, Ferrybridge C in West Yorkshire, and Rugeley in Staffordshire.  While emissions from coal fell in 2016, carbon output from gas rose 12.5% because of increased use of the fuel to generate electricity – although use of gas remains well below highs seen in the 2000s.  Gas use for home and business heating has been falling for a decade, thanks to more insulation and efficient boilers, but the rate of progress has stalled.  Emissions from oil also increased slightly, by 1.6%, as low oil prices and economic growth lead to more miles being driven in the UK, the assessment by Carbon Brief found.  The analysis uses energy figures from the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, and comes before the department’s own estimates for UK carbon dioxide emissions due to be published at the end of the month. The government has pledged that all the UK’s coal-fired power stations will be closed by 2025."
"New research has convincingly quantified how much the Earth has warmed over the past 56 years. Human activities utilize fossil fuels for many beneficial purposes but have an undesirable side effect of adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere at ever-increasing rates. That increase - of over 40%, with most since 1980 - traps heat in the Earth’s system, warming the entire planet.  But how fast is the Earth warming and how much will it warm in the future? Those are the critical questions we need to answer if we are going to make smart decisions on how to handle this issue.   At any time the direct effect of this blanket is small, but the accumulated effects are huge and have consequences for our weather and climate. Over 90% of the extra heat ends up in the ocean and hence perhaps the most important measurements of global warming are made in the oceans.  But measuring the ocean temperature is not straightforward. Since about 2005 a new type of sensing device has been deployed (the Argo float system). These floats (approximately 3500 in total at any time) are spread out across oceans where they autonomously rise and fall in the ocean waters, collecting temperature data to depths of 2000 meters.  When they rise to the ocean surface, they send their data wirelessly to satellites for later analysis. Hence we can now map the ocean heat content quite well. But what about the past, when we mainly had measurements from expendable bathythermographs deployed mainly along major shipping routes and largely confined to the northern hemisphere? Putting data from these various sensors together has been a struggle and has been a major impediment to an accurate quantification of the ocean’s temperature history. Fortunately, a paper just published today in Science Advances uses a new strategy to improve upon our understanding of ocean heating to estimate the total global warming from 1960 to 2015. I was fortunate to co-author the study, which uses several innovative steps to make improvements.  First, we corrected past data for known biases in measurements. Second, we related the temperature measurements to results calculated from advanced climate computer models. Third, we applied temperature knowledge to larger areas so that a single measurement was representative of a large space around the measurement site. Finally, we used their knowledge of recent and well-observed temperatures to show that the method produced excellent results.  We were able to extend our techniques back to the late1950s and show that the rate of global warming has changed significantly in the past 60 years. One main outcome of the study is that it shows we are warming about 13% faster than we previously thought. Not only that but the warming has accelerated. The warming rate from 1992 is almost twice as great as the warming rate from 1960. Moreover, it is only since about 1990 that the warming has penetrated to depths below about 700 meters. Prior work by the same team compared climate models to measurements, and there was excellent agreement on average. There are a few other more subtle issues that the new paper addresses. For example, the study shows that a large amount of warming occurred in the southern oceans. Only recently have the Atlantic and Indian Oceans began to heat up. Lead author, Lijing Cheng says: We know that ocean observations were very sparse until the Argo era. There were major gaps in data, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere. Our challenge was to assess the changes to global ocean heat and fill data gaps. A major issue is to ensure gap-filling is reliable. It is this issue that motivated the study. We proposed an advance gap-filling strategy and used it to attain near global coverage. We rigorously evaluated the reliability of our approach and as a result, we have much higher confidence that the ocean and the Earth are warming at a faster rate than previously thought. One of the co-authors, John Fasullo added: This study shows that more heat is likely to have been absorbed by the oceans over the past 50 years than had previously been reported. With upward revisions in our estimates of the climate’s sensitivity to greenhouse gases and the associated resultant sea level rise.  Our team’s press release noted: we know the oceans are much warmer now and they contain the memory of climate change. Higher sea surface temperatures are continually reinforced by the extra heat beneath the ocean surface. The oceans are affecting weather and climate through more intense rains. This process is a major reason why 2016 was the hottest year ever recorded at the Earth’s surface, beating out 2015 which was the previous record. Additionally 2015 was a year with record hurricanes, heat waves, droughts, and wild-fires around the world. The knowledge about how the ocean has warmed, and how the warmth has spread in depth and over the different oceans is consistent with theory and models, and grounds the theories of human-induced climate change. The memory of past warming is in the oceans, and even though there are weather events that alter the details daily, the atmosphere above the oceans is warmer and moister than it used to be.  It is these changes that affect storms, such as the deluges that have recently affected California, or which have led storms to produce “thousand year floods” as has been seen in the Carolinas with Hurricane Matthew, or the Louisiana floods in August last year, or the Houston floods in April, and so forth. This kind of knowledge and understanding has profound consequences."
"The UN’s climate chief has been unable to secure a meeting with the US state department as Donald Trump’s administration mulls whether to withdraw the US from the international climate effort. Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), is currently in the US and has sought a meeting with Rex Tillerson, the secretary of state, and other officials over the commitment of the new administration to global climate goals.  However, Espinosa said she had not had a response to her request and a state department official said there were no scheduled meetings to announce. The official added: “As with many policies, this administration is conducting a broad review of international climate issues.” Former US secretaries of state haven’t always met directly with the head of the UNFCCC, with meetings often conducted by the US climate envoy, a position currently vacant. However, the lack of response to Espinosa, the former foreign minister of Mexico, is unusual even given the nascency of the new administration. “I don’t think it’s a good sign – it’s a snub,” said Maria Ivanova, a global governance expert at the University of Massachusetts. “Patricia Espinosa has been very gracious about this and she understands what it is like to be a foreign minister. But not responding to the executive secretary is not good manners.” During the presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly vowed to “cancel” the Paris climate accord and stop all American payment to UN global warming programs. His administration’s stated aim is to slash payments to countries threatened by rising seas, crop failures and heatwaves. Following his election win, Trump said he in fact had an “open mind” about the Paris deal while Tillerson has insisted that the US should have a “seat at the table” in climate talks without specifying exactly what America’s role should be. There are elements within the administration pushing for a rapid exit from the international climate forum. Quitting the Paris deal, in which 196 nations pledged to keep the global temperature rise to below 2C, would take four years in total.  But exiting the UNFCCC itself would provide a faster route, at about a year, and this approach has been proposed by Steven Groves, a lawyer at the conservative Heritage Foundation, who was part of Trump’s state department landing team. This stance has been countered by a group that reportedly includes Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter, and her husband, the Trump adviser Jared Kushner. The duo are understood to have convinced Trump to not include language critical of the Paris agreement in a forthcoming executive order. Dozens of large businesses, including Nike, Hewlett-Packard and Ikea, have also urged Trump to stick with the Paris deal.  “There seems to be a debate within the administration about this and it’s clear there are some voices who understand that withdrawing from Paris would have significant diplomatic repercussions,” said David Waskow, director of the international climate initiative at the World Resources Institute.  “Economically, it would also send the unfortunate signal that the US isn’t at the forefront of clean energy technology. There are plenty of reasons to stay within the agreement.” While Trump has previously dismissed the science of global warming, the potential loss of American prestige and international influence could prove key in keeping the US involved in climate talks.  Climate is a top line issue in forums such as the G7 and G20 and China has already signaled that it will seek to move into a leadership position should the US pull back. Other countries may even exact punitive measures in response to American withdrawal from the effort to maintain a habitable planet.  “Those countries with high ambitions for Paris may impose border adjustment tariffs on the US, which would dramatically increase the prospect of a global trade war,” said John Sterman, director of MIT’s system dynamics group. “That is something that would be very unhelpful. “If we withdraw from Paris or the UNFCCC, we make it much harder to limit the potentially catastrophic impacts of climate change. That would create a huge flow of refugees from the Middle East and elsewhere who will look to go to the US and Europe. There won’t be a wall big enough to keep out people fleeing floods and crop failures.” Greenhouse gas emissions cuts pledged by countries at the Paris talks are still insufficient to keep the planet to the 2C warming limit. The world would still be on a pathway to a 3C, or more, temperature increase by the end of the century, which would accelerate sea level rise, trigger food and water insecurity and threaten whole ecosystems such as coral reefs."

"The huge growth in flights from Heathrow’s planned new runway could be carbon neutral, according to an ambition revealed by the airport. The 260,000 extra flights a year anticipated from the third runway would make the airport the UK’s largest source of carbon emissions. But Heathrow’s new sustainability plan suggests other ways to offset the leap in emissions, including by restoring British peat bogs. The new plan, called Heathrow 2.0, sets a wide range of targets to tackle carbon emissions, illegal levels of local air pollution, and noise. The airport will use 100% renewable electricity from April and aim to get 35,000 more people a day using public transport rather than arriving in cars by 2030 and double that by 2040. The third runway, now backed by the government, is highly controversial, with critics arguing it could dash hopes of meeting the UK’s climate change targets and solving local air pollution problems. About 95% of Heathrow’s carbon emissions come from aircraft, but aviation is one of the toughest sectors in which to cut carbon, as the electric batteries than can power cars are too heavy for planes.  John Holland-Kaye, the chief executive of Heathrow, said: “We are not doing this to convince somebody that we are anything we aren’t. We are setting out what we are going to do and people can judge us by our actions. We are going to play our part in the challenge of climate change.” The plan sets out firm short-term targets, including removing the last 5% of flights made by the most polluting aircraft by 2020 and cutting the number of late-running flights arriving in the middle of the night – currently about one a day – by half this year. The aspiration to make growth from the new runway carbon-neutral relies significantly on the global aviation deal agreed in October to offset most new emissions after 2020. The most novel aspect of Heathrow’s new plan to explore the restoration of peatlands in the UK to offset carbon, which would be “a very British solution”, said Holland-Kaye. Peatlands cover 12% of the UK but 80% are in poor condition. “The opportunity is absolutely massive,” said the environmentalist Tony Juniper, who was a paid consultant on Heathrow’s new plan. “The vast majority of peatlands are degraded and it is releasing billions of tonnes of carbon over decades.” He said restoration would also benefit flood prevention and wildlife. Holland-Kaye said it was vital to also set out longer term plans even if it was unclear as yet how to achieve them: “There are some really challenging aspirations around carbon, and even if we don’t get all the way there, every tonne of carbon we are able to prevent going into the atmosphere is a tonne less that our children have to deal with.” Andrew Pendleton of Friends of the Earth said: “We have to say, that if you look at this coldly, it makes Heathrow one of the most progressive airports in the world. But there is a jumbo-jet sized elephant in the room – a new runway that would see 260,000 extra flights a year, and that comes at a significant environmental price.” “It is deeply irresponsible of the government to sign off on this expansion on the assumption that something will come along” to solve the challenges, he said. A cross-party committee of MPs recently accused the government of “magical thinking” over the future solutions to Heathrow’s environmental challenges. Tim Johnson of the Aviation Environment Federation said: “The plan aspires to a cleaner and quieter future but its detail is largely concerned with short-term, incremental improvements that are not up to the challenges that would come with runway expansion. There is nothing in this report to suggest that we are any closer to finding effective solutions.” Holland-Kaye said Heathrow’s passenger numbers have grown by 80% since the early 1990s, but that road traffic to the airport has stayed broadly the same, thanks to new public transport links.  “If you have a plan and you really focus on it, you can make a significant change in people’s behaviour,” he said. “The great thing about the VW scandal is that the government is now taking [air pollution] seriously, because they are the ones who can have the most influence. Once the will of government gets behind these things, big things can happen relatively quickly.” The new runway would open by 2025 at the earliest, and Holland-Kaye said the new HS2 train line and possible new rail links to the west and south could be a “gamechanger”.  Heathrow is planning to increase the number of short-haul flights within the UK, and will discount their landing fees this year. Critics say such flights should be replaced by rail travel but Holland-Kaye said they were important in helping all regions of the UK to grow. “Unless we have an economy which pays for a shift to being low-carbon, we are not going to make that shift,” he said. The Heathrow plan is “bold and brave”, according to Juniper: “The difference here is the extent to which they have really embraced the challenge rather than trying to avoid taking responsibility.” Asked if fast-growing aviation can ever be sustainable, he said: “It is going to have to be” because stopping more people flying “is not going to happen”.

"William Happer is a physicist at Princeton University – one of those US academic institutions with brand recognition for academic excellence that travels the globe. Happer is well known for his contrarian views (that’s the polite term) on human-caused climate change. So when it emerged last week that the professor might seriously be in the running to be President Donald Trump’s science adviser, that Princeton tag no doubt added an air of authority to his opinions.  In short, Happer thinks more CO2 will only be good for the planet – putting him at odds with science academies around the world. “There’s a whole area of climate so-called science that is really more like a cult,” Happer told the Guardian. “It’s like Hare Krishna or something like that. They’re glassy-eyed and they chant. It will potentially harm the image of all science.”  Happer has also compared the “demonisation” of carbon dioxide to the “demonisation of poor Jews under Hitler” – because a Nazi reference will always get you noticed. But here’s the thing — the first of many to note about Happer. First, he is not, by any stretch, an expert on climate change science. Happer’s record of getting scientific papers published in leading journals on climate change science is at, or very close to, zero. Simply, he knows a lot about some stuff, but he is not a climate scientist. While he has a distinguished career as an atomic physicist, previously serving the administration of George HW Bush as a science director, the 77-year-old’s views on climate science are outnumbered by all the credible evidence, all the credible science agencies and are also being laughed at by the Earth’s thermometers and its melting ice sheets and glaciers. Prof Michael Oppenheimer has scores of articles on climate science in leading journals going back to the mid-1990s. He’s a climate scientist … at Princeton. So what does Oppenheimer think of his colleague? “With respect to climate science and scientists,” Oppenheimer told me by email, “[Happer] is not only unknowledgeable but appears to have become unmoored.” Ouch. But then, maybe Oppenheimer has glassy eyes?  Happer has laid out his thoughts on climate change in some detail in an ongoing Focused Civil Dialogue (my irony meter just exploded) with the Australian climate scientist Prof David Karoly. While Happer’s contribution seems technical, it’s the same parade of zombie talking points that actual climate scientists have been dealing with for years.  Happer says CO2 levels and temperatures have been much higher in the past and that life “flourished” under these conditions many millions of years ago.  He doesn’t mention that during those times sea levels were probably several metres – sometimes well over 10 metres – higher than they are today. If that’s the world you want to advocate, then it’s time to call the removal guys for most of the world’s major coastal cities.  The climate scientist Dr Nerilie Abram, of Australian National University, specialises in the climate of the ancient past. She told me:  Warm periods in Earth’s past tell us a lot about how our climate works and what we can expect if we don’t act to halt current climate change. The last time that temperatures were similar to now, this caused parts of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets to slowly melt and sea level globally ended up six to nine metres higher than now. If we go back 3 million years – the last time carbon dioxide levels were at today’s level – sea level was probably around 10 to 40 metres higher. Life on Earth might not be fazed by those numbers or even higher ones, but for human civilisations they would be catastrophic. Happer also rolls out that mouldy old chestnut that CO2 is just food for plants, but ignores the research on the impacts that higher concentrations of CO2 will have on our global food supply.  Research into some staple crops such as rice, wheat and sorghum, for example, finds that they end up with less protein when CO2 is at higher concentrations. That’s before you worry about how food crops will cope with droughts and heatwaves.  At a conference in December Happer said his “main concern” was that climate change was “likely to damage public perceptions of science”.  If Happer is concerned about the reputation of science, then he’s picking some very odd places to hang around – that conference being one of them. The Arizona gathering was organised by Freedom Force International – a group led by the famed conspiracy theorist G Edward Griffin. He fits right in with the booming culture of conspiracy that’s growing big audiences online. Among many other things, Griffin has said there is “no such thing” as HIV and that human-caused climate change is a hoax.  Griffin also promotes conspiracies around “chemtrails”. Just punch that word into your favourite search engine for hours of family fun (don’t actually do that).  To summarise, there’s a plan to spray the atmosphere with chemicals added to planes to poison everyone and “they” are using weather modification as a weapon. Griffin has said “somebody is spending a lot of money and effort to spray the planet” and that this is probably some international effort. Also appearing at the conference was the British hereditary peer and climate science denier Lord Christopher Monckton, who likes to say he was appointed as a reviewer of the last big UN intergovernmental panel on climate change report without mentioning that, literally, you need no qualifications and can “appoint” yourself. Happer’s speech to the conference isn’t yet online but an interview he gave at the venue after is.  He goes over the same ground. CO2 is really awesome and life would be much better if there was a lot more of it. “I don’t think there are any cons to CO2 … we are really in a CO2 famine,” he says. “My main concern is that it’s likely to damage public perceptions of science. I am hoping that I and other scientists can persuade the public that we are not all for sale.” I’m struggling to understand how someone concerned with the reputation of science would want to lend his name, and the name of Princeton University, to a conference organised by conspiracy theorists.  This is also the bit when we mention that Happer was caught in a sting by Greenpeace activists in 2015, when he offered to write a report on the benefits of carbon dioxide for a fake fossil fuel client while avoiding any need to disclose the funding’s source. Happer asked that rather than pay him, the fake lobbyists should instead pay the CO2 Coalition – a climate science denial group based in the US. Tax documents list Happer as a director and president. He has also given evidence in a court case on behalf of the coal company Peabody Energy where he similarly asked that his fee go to the CO2 Coalition. He laid these facts out in emails released by Greenpeace, stating that the coalition did not pay him any fees or salary. Remembering Happer’s dislike of science being “for sale”, it’s noteworthy that his CO2 Coalition colleague Patrick Moore was paid last year by a major European coal lobby organisation to give a presentation in Strasbourg telling the audience we should “celebrate CO2”. No doubt Happer would argue that money does not influence the views of people like Moore, though he does say that it influences actual climate scientists who get research grants from universities and governments. Go figure. Whether or not Happer gets the gig as Trump’s science adviser remains to be seen. But given the climate science deniers and fossil fuel advocates who Trump has already employed, it seems Happer will fit right in."
"The citizens of four major European countries think the impacts of climate change such as severe floods and storms are already affecting them, according to a major new polling study. The research dispels the idea that global warming is widely seen as a future problem, and also shows strong support for action to tackle global warming, including subsidies for clean energy and big financial penalties for nations that refuse to be part of the international climate deal signed in Paris in 2015 – as US president Donald Trump has threatened. There was also strong support for giving financial aid to developing nations to cope with the impacts of climate change. Renewable energy was viewed very positively in all nations, but fracking had little support, with just 20% of people seeing it positively in the UK, 15% in Germany and 9% in France. Nuclear power was also unpopular: only 23% of those in France, where it supplies the vast majority of electricity, have a favourable opinion. Overwhelming majorities of people in the UK, Germany, France and Norway said climate change was at least partly caused by human activities, such as burning fossil fuels. But only a third thought the vast majority of scientists agreed with this, despite about 97% of climate scientists doing so. “It is encouraging to see that most people in this very large study recognise that climate change is happening, and that support for the need to tackle it remains high amongst the people we surveyed,” said Prof Nick Pidgeon at Cardiff University, who led the international project.  He said the firm backing of the public could be important in the light of Trump’s opposition to climate action: “With the recently shifting political mood in some countries, climate policy is now entering a critical phase. It is therefore even more important that the public’s clear support for the Paris agreement is carried through by policymakers across Europe and worldwide.” Nick Molho, at the Aldersgate Group, a business alliance that lobbies for a sustainable economy, said: “The UK government should build on the existing public support for climate policies to put forward in the near future a clear plan to meet the emissions reduction targets.”  The polling study is the first in-depth climate change research in multiple European nations and involved interviewing more than 1,000 people in each country, with the results then weighted to be nationally representative. The citizens gave near identical answers to the question of when the impacts of global warming would be felt, with 60% answering that they were already here. At least two-thirds of them supported their nation being part of the Paris climate deal and they were at least two to one in favour of penalising countries that were not, perhaps via the border carbon taxes proposed by some French politicians.  “People see that if there are free riders, that is not a very good thing,” said Pidgeon. Earlier in March, the US state department snubbed the UN’s climate change chief when she requested a meeting. Subsidising renewable energy with public money was popular, with 70% support in the UK and Germany, 75% in France, and 87% in Norway. Increasing taxes on fossil fuels was supported in oil- and gas-rich Norway, but opposed two to one in France and Germany. In the UK, people were evenly split over tax hikes for fossil fuels. Another split was in the trust people had in the European commission and national and local governments to transform their nation’s energy system to cleaner forms of energy. Germans were generally positive, but those in the UK had little trust in any of the institutions. The polling for the study took place in June 2016, before the Brexit referendum. The report is available online from noon UK time on Wednesday 8 March. "
"Optimism has always been in short supply in conversations about global warming. Only for the briefest window – after the Paris climate agreement was reached in December 2015 – did the words “climate” and “hope” look reasonable next to each other in headlines. Then came 2016. And yet, in spite of these past 12 months, I remain optimistic.  Yes, I know that Donald Trump – a man who has dismissed global warming as “very expensive … bullshit” – was elected president of the world’s second biggest emitter of carbon dioxide. His actions since his inauguration have only confirmed his intentions to halt progress to reduce the vast emissions produced by the US.  And I know that in the UK there’s yet more cause for concern. A series of U-turns has transformed the UK from a world leader to a world let-down. The Department of Energy and Climate Change has been scrapped. The country is expected to miss its 2020 climate targets. And the weakening of the European Union, caused by the Brexit vote, may jeopardise climate action across the continent. These are serious developments, but I’m not convinced they’re big enough to unsettle progress. In fact, a defiant mood has emerged in response to these setbacks. Some of this defiance comes from within the US itself. Most notably California, the richest US state, is poised to tackle Trump’s climate stance head on. Governor Jerry Brown proclaimed: “We’re ready to fight. We’re ready to defend.” Elsewhere in the US, cities have pulled funding from Wells Fargo bank, citing its involvement in the infamous Dakota Access pipeline. And hundreds of companies have urged Trump to continue progress towards a low-carbon economy. But the most striking response to Trump has been from the only nation that emits more carbon dioxide than the US: China. China is seizing Trump’s election as an opportunity to become a global climate leader. Make no mistake – this is a defiant act.  China explicitly rejected Trump’s absurd suggestion that climate change is a Chinese hoax. And Xie Xiaoping, the chair of Huanghe Hydropower Development, a large scale power developer, offered: “The Chinese government will carry out and fulfil its international commitments … I don’t care what Mr Trump says … I think what he says is nonsense.” China is already backing up this talk with action. China’s solar capacity doubled in 2016. The country will plough £292bn more into renewables by 2020. In fact, China is already building more renewables than any other nation. Most remarkably of all, China’s dependence on coal is faltering. Its demand for coal may even have peaked. It’s hard to stress how amazing this last fact is. Only a few years ago, climate scientists and economists spoke about the never-ending rise of coal in China as an inevitable, insurmountable problem. After giving climate talks, I would be asked “why should we bother doing anything when China keeps burning more coal?” by skeptical audience members. The idea of China leading the climate fight would have been unthinkable then. Today, Chinese youth are more concerned about climate change than any other threat, suggesting that Chinese climate action will only intensify with time. And China is just one example of progress, albeit a dramatic one. Sweden has set a deadline for reaching zero emissions. Despite continued coal development, India has now unveiled ambitious levels of renewable deployment for the next decade. Even the great oil producer, Saudi Arabia, is seeking to become a “solar powerhouse”. The list goes on. These actions add up. The once relentless year-on-year rise of carbon dioxide emissions has flatlined for the past three years. Some analysts project that they could finally begin falling by 2020. Despite this progress, my optimism remains cautious. I know that the pledges in the Paris deal will see temperatures rise by 3C above pre-industrial levels, well above the 2C that the deal aims to stay below. This kind of temperature rise could force millions from coastal cities, while rendering other regions uninhabitable. Low-lying island nations may cease to exist. But the prevailing mood gives me hope. A few years ago, inaction on climate change was the norm. Today, the expectation is progress. The world has formally agreed that this is a problem that needs to be tackled, and no country besides the US has threatened to renegue on this agreement.  Renewable energy is fast becoming so cheap that it’s often the best option, and coal power plants are closing around the world – even in Trump’s America. Grassroots movements are gaining traction the world over, building on what momentum there is. Today, it’s the Trumps of the world who are the outliers. For the first time in my life, I feel like we are moving along the path to tackling climate change. Now we need to make sure we sprint rather than saunter.

"Clive Hamilton has been at the pointy end of public discourse on climate change for more than 20 years. Among lots of other things, he’s written challenging books on the science, founded a progressive thinktank and had a failed crack at being an MP for the Greens.  He got his Order of Australia medal for his contributions on climate and sustainability almost eight years ago. His book Scorcher: The Dirty Politics of Climate Change is now a decade old.  In 2012, Hamilton was appointed to the Australian government’s Climate Change Authority (CCA) – a body charged with making recommendations to government on climate policy in line with the science. But last month, Hamilton quit the CCA after hearing a chorus of government ministers, led by the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, touting the oxymoron of “clean coal”. Now Hamilton has spelled out his antipathy towards Turnbull – a politician who only six years ago was a climate change hawk, who advocated for a massive shift to renewable energy, and who was utterly sceptical of “clean coal”. In an interview for my podcast, Positive Feedback, Hamilton gives a withering personal assessment of the prime minister and reveals what was going on inside the CCA before his resignation.  “I wasn’t disappointed, or upset,” says Hamilton on Turnbull’s recent advocacy for building more coal plants, “I was disgusted.”  “For Turnbull to be using that outrageous term [clean coal] to describe coal-fired power stations – I was disgusted.” “It’s a tragedy to watch a man like Malcolm Turnbull to shrink into the kind of shell of a person that he has become. I don’t understand why a man like that does not say ‘look, I have some fundamental principles and I might lose the leadership but at least I will be able to look at myself in the mirror for the rest of my life.’”  Hamilton points out that a decade ago Turnbull was pledging he would “not lead a party that is not as committed to effective action on climate change as I am.”  “The truth is that he now does lead a Liberal party that has the same views as he does on climate change,” says Hamilton.  “The Liberal party has undergone a transformation in the last 10 years and it’s now dominated federally by troglodytes from the hard right – the anti-science brigade, some of whom probably cheered when Pauline Hanson attacked vaccinations the other day. These are the anti-science, anti-expertise crowd — the kind of people who now advise Donald Trump.” Trump’s election, believes Hamilton, has galvanised climate science deniers around the world, including those in Turnbull’s party. “I think that [climate science] deniers now are more inclined to believe they were right and history is on their side and this whole thing will be shown to be a hoax and a scandal – that does embolden them and undoubtedly that’s a factor in Turnbull’s partyroom.” Hamilton publicly resigned from the CCA last month, citing as a final straw the government’s advocacy for coal. That’s public knowledge.  But in the interview, Hamilton tells me the problems seemed to start in October 2015 when the new Turnbull government made fresh appointments to the authority.  “The whole character of the authority changed,” Hamilton says. After that point, the CCA was “dominated by people who want action, but not too much action.” In a story from inside the CCA, Hamilton says: “There was this talk of a secret plan … to develop a tricky policy, the emissions intensity scheme in the electricity sector, which [the authority] would recommend in a report and this would be used by Malcolm Turnbull to justify what he wanted to do.” This, Hamilton says, was touted by some members of the authority as a tool for Turnbull to use against a backbench reluctant to do anything on climate change.  Hamilton was told to “pull his head in” and get in line with the plan that he was told represented the best chance of progress.  He was initially “half persuaded” by the idea but as time wore on, he says he realised the “secret plan” wasn’t plausible and that Turnbull was drifting further away from any meaningful action on climate change.  In late 2016, the energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, said an emissions intensity scheme, or something like it, could be part of a government review into climate policy. That position lasted only a few hours before Frydenberg backtracked and Turnbull dismissed the idea.  “Pathetic,” says Hamilton. In August 2016, the cracks in the authority went on public display.  The CCA had published a report recommending cuts in greenhouse gas emissions in line with the government’s current target – a reduction of 26% to 28% by 2030. The CCA had previously recommended that target should be at least 40%.  Hamilton and his CCA colleague Professor David Karoly, a climate scientist, refused to sign the report and instead issued their own, leading calls for them to resign.  So now the professor of public ethics at Charles Sturt University is out of the authority and readying himself to launch a third book in a climate change trilogy, Defiant Earth: The fate of humans in the anthropocene. He thinks readers will feel “reflective… but you won’t feel hopeful.”  He says: “If you look at what the scientists are saying and you’re not despairing then you are not really listening to what they are saying.”"
"Australia’s big four banks invested three times as much in global fossil fuels as they did in clean energy in 2016, despite pledging to help Australia transition to a low carbon economy. The banks provided a combined $10bn to projects around the world that expanded non-renewable energy, according to finance group Market Forces.  ANZ and the Commonwealth Bank were the worst offenders, investing over $3bn each in fossil fuels. In the same period, ANZ only lent $225m to renewables, giving it a 14:1 ratio.  Overall the banks invested $7bn more in fossil fuels than clean energy. Only NAB approached parity, lending $1.35bn to non-renewables and $1.3bn to renewables. Commonwealth Bank and Westpac invested $846m and $426m in clean energy respectively, which was 3.5 and 4.6 times less than what they invested in fossil fuels.  These figures come despite all four banks publicly supporting a 2C global warming limit laid out in the Paris climate agreement.  “The first step to back up that commitment is to stop expanding the carbon fuel economy,” said the executive director of Market Forces, Julien Vincent. “We’re not talking small projects, we’re talking about opening up one of the largest offshore oil bases in Norway, or a new gas field in PNG.”  The report cited, among others, investments in Norway’s Johan Sverdup oil field, America’s Creole Trail natural gas pipeline, and the Browse basin gas field off the coast of Western Australia.   The Commonwealth Bank environment policy states it should “actively seek opportunities to lend to, invest in, and support businesses that decrease dependence on fossil fuels”. “The updated policy expresses our commitment to support the transition to a low carbon economy”, it said in a 2015 press release. Greenpeace said the bank was risking the credibility of its brand through fossil fuel investment. “The Commonwealth Bank claims to support the Paris Agreement’s goal of keeping climate change to well below 2 degrees but it has lent more to fossil fuel projects since the Paris Agreement was signed than any other Australian bank,” its climate campaigner, Nikola Casule, said.  “The Commonwealth Bank knows it has one of the most recognisable brands in Australia, it also knows that most Australians support stronger action on climate change. [Chief executive] Ian Narev ... needs to decide whether he wants that brand associated with dirty coal or a future powered by clean renewable energy.” ANZ’s climate change statement notes that while “some of our stakeholders view our financing of fossil fuel industries as in direct conflict with our stated position on the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions”, it supports a “gradual and orderly transition”. Vincent said the figures included loans made to coal and gas projects “across the entire supply chain – from extraction to transport and combustion”. For companies with part-investments in fossil fuels, Market Forces apportioned the loan according to the percentage of the company’s business in non-renewables.  However, he noted that 2016 saw less fossil fuel investment than 2015, and no loans to new coal projects, in what he described as an “important trend”.  “I think it’s definitely become a lot harder for banks to fund coal because it’s so clearly connected to climate change and other environmental and social issues,” he said. He called for Australian banks to put a blanket bans on funding new coalmines. “I wouldn’t ever take the kind of positive trends we see in the lending and assume the banks aren’t going to fund the Adani coalmine, for example. Politically there is a lot of leaning on the banks to not cave in to environmental campaigns. We need them to show a little bit of courage and say no to the Carmichael coalmine and expansion.”  An ANZ spokesperson said that “lending to the sector was relatively modest.” “The resources industry is a core part of the Australian economy. It remains essential for power generation … we consider that decarbonisation of the economy must be managed responsibly and over time,” it said."

"First established in 1996 and occurring every five years, the State of the Environment report is prepared by independent authors and provides a report card across nine thematic areas – the Antarctic environment, atmosphere, biodiversity, built environment, coasts, heritage, inland waters, land and the marine environment. The report will this year for the first time be available in an interactive digital format, expanding its reach and ensuring greater use and engagement from the academic and broader community.  Like previous reports, this year’s document has its bright spots while also indicating a number of areas where there is much more to do. Good progress has been made in the management of the marine and Antarctic environments, natural and cultural heritage and the built environment, while pressures are building in relation to invasive species, climate change, land use and coastal protection. The number of people in Australia has doubled over the past 50 years. Growing urbanisation (two-thirds of the population live in our capital cities and 90% of people live in 0.22% of Australia’s land area) and heightened economic activity (Australia is experiencing its 26th year of consecutive economic growth) have combined to contribute to additional pressures on the environment. The message, however, is not that development and sustainability are locked in a zero-sum game. Far from it. Rather, we must be conscious of these pressures, prepare for them and put in place a coordinated, comprehensive, well-resourced long-term response. Failure to do so will have a direct and detrimental impact on our quality of life and leave a legacy to future generations that is inferior to the one we have inherited. This is why reports such as this are important and why we must continue to upgrade our capacity to collect and analyse critical environmental data. It’s also why last November I committed – along with state and territory environment ministers – to develop more detailed environmental accounts for Australia to build this capacity to better understand our environment and how best to protect it.  The report indicates that the Antarctic is in “generally good condition”, with evidence that the phasing out of powerful synthetic greenhouse gases, in which Australia has played a lead role under the Montreal protocol, is leading to improvements in the ozone layer. Macquarie Island, which has seen rabbits and rats in plague proportions, is also recovering well following a successful invasive species eradication policy. Invasive species more generally are a growing problem. We are all familiar with the devastation that has been unleashed across our continent by the arrival of cane toads, feral pigs and yellow crazy ants. But feral cats should top this list because their population growth and diet of marsupials, birds and reptiles make them one of the biggest threats to a number of nationally listed species. The good news is that the federal government has acted in implementing a new threatened species strategy and appointing the first threatened species commissioner. However, there is a big task ahead with the addition of 44 animal and five plant species to the threatened species list, meaning there are now 545 animal and 1,312 plant species under threat. One notable mention in the report was that humpback whales are increasing in number to a point where their current listing as “vulnerable” may need to be reconsidered. Australia’s 108 national and 19 world heritage sites are admired both here and abroad and are integral to our cultural history and values. They remain, according to the report, “generally in good condition”, but the Great Barrier Reef last year was subject to a significant bleaching event, with climate change and the El Niño effect to blame. Conscious of the threat to this natural wonder of the world, the federal government is jointly investing with the Queensland government $2bn to support our Reef 2050 plan to improve water quality and preserve the health of the reef. Australia has a strong reputation in management of its national reserve system. Since 2011, the Ningaloo Reef has been added and extensions made to the Tasmanian wilderness and Kakadu properties on the World Heritage List. Since 2012, 12 new places have been added to the National Heritage List, including the Snowy Mountains scheme in New South Wales and Lesueur national park in Western Australia, ensuring that our historic places are preserved for future generations. The report indicates that the impact of changing weather patterns is affecting biodiversity and species habitat. While carbon emissions per capita have declined from 24.1 tonnes in 2011 to 22.2 tonnes in 2015, and energy efficiency improvements are reducing electricity demand, the report makes clear that, for the world to meet its Paris goals, there is much more to do. Land clearing also comes in for attention in the report. With the exception of Queensland, land clearing rates over the past five years “have stabilised in all states and territories” and Indigenous protected areas have substantially increased. Since 2008 there have been an additional 42 agreements and 20.6m hectares which are now covered under the Indigenous protected areas. The national reserve system, protecting important natural assets, has expanded to cover 17.9% of Australia’s land are, compared with 13.4% in 2011. These are all significant improvements which are felt right across the environmental food chain as pollination, seed disposal and species’ survival rely on an ecosystem where vegetation and habitat are protected. Despite the growth in urban population, air and urban water quality remain “good” according to the report, with “noticeable local improvements in water quality in the Murray Darling basin”. Sustainable diversion limits and water efficiency are having a positive impact on the fish and water bird stocks as well as natural vegetation.  There is no room for complacency. Regardless of one’s political persuasion, we all have a vested interest in protecting our commons. The Coalition track record in this regard is strong. The Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, like the Natural Heritage Trust and the first mandatory renewable energy target, were all initiatives of the Howard government. The 10-year Murray-Darling basin plan was implemented by Malcolm Turnbull. Former prime ministers Tony Abbott, Malcolm Fraser, William McMahon, John Gorton, Harold Holt and Robert Menzies all too had significant achievements to their name. The task now is to build on this proud Coalition tradition and to use this report to continue the good work the government is doing across so many areas of environmental policy. Josh Frydenberg is Australia’s minister for the environment and energy"
"Each year, Investa Office Management releases its corporate sustainability report. In 2016, it announced that electricity use was down by 43% since 2004, gas use had fallen 38% over the same time, and water use had also being curtailed.  This sounds impressive but how meaningful are those proclamations? And what difference do they make in the wider context? Now an international movement is urging businesses to take an evidence-based approach to their green strategies, by setting emissions reduction goals in line with climate science. The goal is to encourage the business sector to close the emissions gap left by shortfalls in country-level commitments to the Paris climate agreement.   The push is being led by the Science Based Targets initiative – a partnership between CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project), UN Global Compact, the World Resources Institute and WWF – as well as the We Mean Business coalition. Some of the companies signed up include global behemoths Mars, Kellogg’s, Renault, L’Oréal, AstraZeneca, Sony and Ikea. “Companies, especially the large multinational companies, have been communicating about their emissions footprint for many years now,” says Vincent Hoen, managing consultant of Corporate Climate Action at Ecofys, a Dutch energy and climate consultancy. But “it wasn’t clear what the contribution of the company would need to be to stay in line with climate science,” he says.  A science-based target is one that limits a business’s global share of greenhouse gas emissions to keep warming to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels. This threshold has been widely adopted in international climate policy, including the Paris climate agreement, which Australia ratified in November last year.  Setting science-based targets “gives a lot of credibility to a [company’s] climate strategy,” says Hoen. Unlike previous programs such as the Carbon Disclosure Project, the SBT initiative directly ties corporate emissions goals to the Paris Agreement’s 2C target.  Ecofys, with others, came up with the sectoral decarbonization approach (SDA), the methodology behind the SBT initiative. It works off the global carbon budget of 1tn tonnes, over half of which has already been emitted. Modelling by the International Energy Agency allocates a share of the carbon budget to different industries, and the SDA translates that into company-level targets.  “Globally, it’s been a very popular initiative,” says Monica Richter, climate change business engagement manager at WWF-Australia. “We’ve been overwhelmed by company responses.” So far, 215 businesses have publically committed to setting science-based targets, seven in Australia. These are Australian Ethical Investment, Westpac, Origin Energy, Bank Australia, Investa, Infigen Energy and Teachers Mutual Bank.  “There’s not a large uptake in Australia yet, but you can see the movement starting to happen,” says Jonas Bengtsson, chief executive and co-founder of Sydney-based environmental consultancy Edge Environment. Edge has partnered with Ecofys to champion the initiative in Australia.  Bengtsson is optimistic that numbers will grow. “It’s a very easy sell for companies to get on board with this,” he says. “With the lack of carbon regulation or mechanisms to drive the agreed and necessary change [at the policy level], I think businesses see that they need this predictability for planning purposes and also they have an opportunity to lobby and influence the direction that government is going to take.”  For most businesses, change usually starts with simple initiatives such as energy efficiency and conservation. This could mean support for telecommuting for office workers, less idling of trucks, or creating incentives for manufacturing managers to run production lines more efficiently. “You really want to do the cheaper or cost-positive options first,” says Bengtsson, so that “you get the best bang for your buck in terms of reducing carbon.” Risk is another consideration for business. “Climate risk has been identified as a serious business risk, so setting science-based targets is really important from a business risk point of view,” he says. Climate change can directly threaten business operations, through increased extreme weather events for example. But businesses also face risks if they are unprepared for policy changes that limit emissions or favour low-carbon technologies. Reputational risk can also harm a business’s bottom line. Because targets can be tailored to different business types, the SBT initiative has attracted a broad range of companies. “It’s across all industry sectors, from power generation to the property sector, to manufacturing and food,” says Richter.  The financial sector is taking a lead, with several banks in Australia setting science-based emissions targets, although these don’t currently cover emissions from investment portfolios. “The financial sector has an important role to play in assisting the transition to a low-carbon economy,” says Nicola Murphy, head of environmental sustainability at NAB. NAB’s target is to reduce emissions by 21% from 2015 levels by 2025.  Investa Office Management has also announced a science-based target of net zero carbon emissions by 2040 across its $10bn portfolio of buildings and operations.  Businesses aren’t the only ones getting on-board. In 2016, the City of Melbourne made science-based targets part of its 2016-2021 strategy. A previous target of a 10% cut of 2010 emission levels by 2018 has been replaced by a more ambitious target of 4.5% per year, which will mean a 34% cut in emissions over the 10 years to 2020.  “Cities are leading the charge, where often nations or other levels of government aren’t,” says councillor Cathy Oke, who chairs the city’s environment portfolio. Street lights are a top priority, accounting for 39% of the city’s operational emissions. Over the next three years, all of the city’s 16,000 street lights will be upgraded to LED.  The SBT initiative’s initial goal is for 250 companies to have set science-based targets by 2020. But ultimately, says Richter, they would like to see science-based targets become standard business practice.  "
"The ‘social cost of carbon’ is an estimate of how much carbon pollution costs society via climate damages, and can also be considered the optimal carbon tax price. The US federal estimate ($37 per ton of carbon dioxide pollution) underpins at least 150 regulations across various federal agencies, and has thus become a prime target in the Trump administration’s efforts to roll back Obama’s climate policies.  Yesterday, the House Subcommittees on Environment and Oversight held a hearing on the social cost of carbon. The Republican Congressmen and their witnesses argued the federal estimate is too high, but a majority of economists think it’s too low. Not surprisingly, the Republican witnesses have been heavily funded by the fossil fuel industry. They made two main arguments: 1) that the $37 estimate should be based on domestic, not global climate impacts, and 2) that the government should have used a higher discount rate, which would result in a lower estimate.  Both arguments are entirely backwards. The first argument, articulated by Chairman Andy Biggs (R-AZ), is an immoral one: It is simply not right for Americans to be bearing the brunt of costs when the majority of benefits will be conferred away from home. The “benefits” other countries would reap are effects like reducing the decimation of their crops by climate-fueled droughts. An accurate rephrasing of this statement would read: ‘It is simply not right for Americans pay for their carbon pollution when the majority of the costs and damages will be borne by poor people in third world countries.’ When framed accurately, it’s a completely unethical argument. Moreover, those long-term global climate damages make a clear case for a higher carbon pollution cost. According to a recent paper by William Nordhaus – one of the world’s foremost climate economists – if we want to stay below 2.5°C warming above pre-industrial temperatures (let alone 2°C), the social cost of carbon today is between $100 and $200 per ton of carbon dioxide pollution, and rises by about $10 per year. This conclusion is consistent with several recent studies estimating the carbon cost around $100 to $200 per ton or more. Avoiding dangerous climate change will require a much higher carbon pollution price than the federal estimate, but Republicans think a lower price is better for the economy. Nordhaus’ recent paper also presented an “optimal” cost-benefit scenario that would put a carbon tax today around $30 per ton and result in over 3.5°C global warming above pre-industrial temperatures. So what’s going on there? I spoke with Jonathan Koomey, who’s published several papers on this subject, including a 2013 paper arguing that we should move beyond a cost-benefit approach on climate change toward a strategy he calls “working forward toward a goal.” As Koomey explained: It’s impossible to calculate optimal outcomes decades hence, and that makes the benefit-cost approach problematic. One reason why it’s impossible is because we can’t predict the exact timing and consequences of pivotal events (like 9/11 or Pearl Harbor) or of technological breakthroughs. Another important reason is that economic and social systems do not exhibit structural constancy like physical systems do. For example, the costs of wind turbines, solar panels, and other mass produced technologies have reliably dropped in price 10-20% for every doubling of production experience. Most economic models ignore these increasing returns because they imply that there is no optimal path; just many possible paths with similar costs. Economic modelers have recoiled in horror from this implication for decades. One study published in 2000 looked at many possible scenarios regarding the evolution of our energy systems. Among those, about 10% were very close to “least-cost” scenario, but they varied widely in their mix of fossil fuels and low-carbon technologies and their consequent carbon pollution: The underlying scenarios include futures that range from an increasing dependence on fossil energy sources to a complete transition to alternative energy sources and nuclear energy. Thus, one of the results of the analysis is that different structures of energy system emerge with similar overall costs … it is not possible to choose a priori “optimal” direction of energy systems development. Because savings accrue interest over time, $100 today is more valuable than $100 in the future. To account for this, economists use what’s known as the “discount rate.” For example, using a fairly standard discount rate of 3%, it would only be worth spending $7 today to avoid $100 of climate damages in the year 2100. In his recent paper, Nordhaus used a discount rate of over 4% - hence his “optimal” economic scenario has a lot of global warming. The idea is to build up interest and use the money to pay for future climate damages. In yesterday’s hearing, Republicans argued that the government should consider an even higher discount rate of 7%, based on Office of Management and Budget (OMB) policy. However, OMB says that if the policy will have “important intergenerational benefits or costs,” a lower discount rate should also be considered. That’s certainly the case for climate change – many economists and scientists argue the discount rate should be much lower - even zero - when dealing with risks big enough to imperil human civilization.  One problem is that climate change might disrupt the global economy and hamper economic growth, which would prevent future generations from actually being richer, as higher discount rates assume. For example, in the more than 3°C warming that would result in Nordhaus’ “optimal” scenario (and from Republican climate policies, and lower carbon prices), we would experience widespread coral mortality resulting in a collapse of many marine ecosystems, glacier retreats threatening water supplies for millions of people, sea level rise of over 1 meter by 2100 and much more thereafter, etc. It’s a potentially catastrophic scenario that would make it impossible to maintain the GDP growth implied in the typical business-as-usual economic modeling scenario. There’s another problem the economic models and Republicans aren’t accounting for: money isn’t everything. For example, would you be happier if somebody handed you $500,000 in exchange for a hurricane destroying your house and its contents, valued at $490,000? You’ve lost your home and all your belongings, but you’re richer! Economic models can’t value things like suffering or biodiversity – what dollar value do we put on a species that’s gone extinct? How about mass extinctions? These are moral questions that economic models can’t account for, that the Republicans ignored in this congressional hearing. The issues described above (among others) are why many scientists and economists are moving away from fraught climate cost-benefit evaluations and toward target-based scenarios. Even Nordhaus’ recent paper focused more on climate targets than optimal scenarios. As Koomey pointed out: If we can’t know what is “optimal” then it’s better to shoot for a goal like 2°C based on our knowledge of the climate system and figure out what we need to get there. This is a more business oriented framing of the problem, as well as a more scientific framing. CEOs know that we can’t predict the future with accuracy, so they set a big strategic goal then figure out what it will take to get there. Then they embark on that path, knowing that they will need to alter course as reality dictates.  In this approach, we can use economics to assess the cost-effectiveness of different near-term strategies for hitting climate targets. That is a task to which economic tools are well-suited, and avoids the tricky judgments buried in discount rates and other modeling assumptions when assessing long-term choices. Instead, the societal value judgment about climate risks is explicit in the chosen warming limit. While aiming for targets like 2°C makes sense, hitting those targets will require aggressive climate policies – likely more aggressive than those currently being proposed, for example by the Republican elder statesmens’ suggested carbon tax, and certainly far more aggressive than the backwards steps currently being taken by Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress.  And if we want to protect future generations, it will take a much higher – not lower – carbon pollution price."

"Australia’s financial institutions could be required to test climate-risk scenarios as international regulators continue to warn of the economic dangers posed by climate change. Geoff Summerhayes, executive board member of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (Apra), told a Senate committee that climate scenario testing could be added to the other common scenarios Apra requires financial institutions to face to ensure their systems are robust.   It’s been more than a year since the COP21 Paris climate change conference, when the former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg was appointed to head a taskforce to provide investors, insurers, banks and consumers with more information. The move was part of plans for a voluntary industry-led code announced by the Financial Stability Board (FSB), the G20 body that monitors and makes recommendations about the financial system. Last month Summerhayes warned climate change posed a material risk to the entire financial system and urged companies to start adapting. Apra is the regulator that oversees the $6tn industry made up of banks, building societies, superannuation, insurance companies and other financial institutions.  Summerhayes said Apra already sent out common scenarios for institutions to test. These scenarios have an economic factor, including an asset price shock and, in the case of the insurance industry, a potential liabilities scenario as well. “It is possible in the future that climate could be such a risk that we would want to test,” Summerhayes said. “That is not in our current plans but it is possible as other emerging risks are, that we would scenario test.” He acknowledged the Bank of England’s Prudential Regulatory Authority (PRA) had been very active on climate change. The bank’s governor, Mark Carney, has warned of financial crises and falling living standards unless corporations faced up to the risks. “Apra is not first prudential regulator to make statements about climate,” he said. Emma Herd, the chief executive of Investor Group on Climate Change, told the committee the political debate in recent years had stopped companies speaking publicly about their strategic response to climate change. “In terms of company reporting, the challenge for companies is that … any statement that is made around climate change as a financial risk is then interpreted through the prism of the political debate,” Herd said. “So companies have to be incredibly cautious about statements that they are making and constantly apply that political lens and I think that is creating a level of conservatism that is inhibiting how companies talk about their strategic response to climate change. “Companies are often much more prepared to talk fully and frankly to investors about their view than they are to talk publicly and into the public debate because it is just seen through the prism of the debate of the last 10 years.” Herd revealed unpublished research from the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors from 1 March this year, in which an analysis of 167 ASX 200 companies found there were large gaps in corporate reporting. It found: Herd said reports were very short on detail with many companies simply disclosing their emissions. Very few disclosed a strategy for dealing with the climate-related issues that might affect the businesses, or report on mitigating these risks. Summerhayes said his climate warning last month came about due to three factors: Australia’s Paris commitments, the Bloomberg taskforce and the legal opinion by Noel Hutley SC for the Centre for Policy Development and the Future Business Council on company directors’ duties and climate change. Last month he said: “The opinion found that company directors who fail to properly consider and disclose foreseeable climate-related risks to their business could be held personally liable for breaching their statutory duty of due care and diligence under the Corporations Act.” Summerhayes said climate was an active discussion in many of the institutions supervised by Apra.  “Markers that have been put down in the last year are significant and markets are already adjusting to those markers and the extent to which the draft report to FSB is adopted or not, we are of the view that a transition is under way to a lower-carbon world and that has implications on the risks that Apra-regulated entities need to oversee. “Hence we expect them to be having a conversation about it.” Kate O’Rourke of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission said the regulatory framework was flexible enough to accommodate scenario testing and companies could choose to dramatically change their information disclosures on climate risks.  Last month a coalition of business, energy, climate and welfare groups issued a joint statement warning that a decade of partisan politics and finger-pointing had destroyed investor confidence in Australia’s energy sector. The Senate inquiry, initiated by Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson and restarted after the federal election, is looking into carbon risk and disclosure in corporate Australia."
"It hits you in the face and clings to you. It makes tall buildings whine as their air conditioning plants struggle to cope. It makes the streets deserted and the ice-cold salons of corner pubs get crowded with people who don’t like beer. It is the Aussie heatwave: and it is no joke. Temperatures in the western suburbs of Sydney, far from the upmarket beachside glamour, reached 47C (117F) last week, topping the 44C I experienced there the week before. For reference, if it reached 47C in the middle of the Sahara desert, that would be an unusually hot day.  For Sydney, 2017 was the hottest January on record. This after 2016 was declared the world’s hottest year on record. Climate change, even in some developed societies, is becoming climate disruption – and according to a UN report, one of the biggest disruptions may only now be getting under way. El Niño, a temperature change in the Pacific ocean that happens cyclically, may have begun interacting with the long-term process of global warming, with catastrophic results. Let’s start by admitting the science is not conclusive. El Niño disrupts the normal pattern by which warm water flows westwards across the Pacific, pulling the wind in the same direction; it creates storms off South America and droughts – together with extreme temperatures – in places such as Australia. It is an irregular cycle, lasting between two and seven years, and therefore can only be theorised using models. Some of these models predict that, because of climate change, El Niño will happen with increased frequency – possibly double. Others predict the effects will become more devastating, due to the way the sub-systems within El Niño react with each other as the air and sea warm. What cannot be disputed is that the most recent El Niño in 2015/16 contributed to the extreme weather patterns of the past 18 months, hiking global temperatures that were already setting records. (Although, such is the level of rising, both 2015 and 2016 would have still been the hottest ever without El Niño.) Sixty million people were “severely affected” according to the UN, while 23 countries – some of which no longer aid recipients – had to call for urgent humanitarian aid. The catastrophe prompted the head of the World Meteorological Association to warn: “This naturally occurring El Niño event and human-induced climate change may interact and modify each other in ways that we have never before experienced.” The warning was enough to prompt the UN to issue a global action plan, with early warning systems, beefed-up aid networks and disaster relief preparation, and calls for developing countries to “climate proof” their economic plans. Compare all this – the science, the modelling, the economic foresight and the attempt to design multilateral blueprint – with the actions of the jackass who runs Australia’s finance ministry. Scott Morrison barged into the parliament chamber to wave a lump of coal at the Labor and Green opposition benches, taunting them: “Don’t be afraid, don’t be scared. It’s coal. It was dug up by men and women who work in the electorate of those who sit opposite.” Coal, argues the Australian conservative government, has given the economy “competitive energy advantage for more than 100 years”. Labor and the Greens had called, after the Paris climate accord, for an orderly shutdown of the coal-fired power stations that produce 60% of the country’s energy. The Aussie culture war over coal is being fuelled by the resurgence of the white-supremacist One Nation party, led by Pauline Hanson, which is pressuring mainstream conservatives to drop commitments to the Paris accord and, instead, launch a “royal commission into the corruption of climate science”, which its members believe is a money-making scam. All over the world, know-nothing xenophobes are claiming – without evidence – that climate science is rigged. Their goal is to defend coal-burning energy, promote fracking, suppress the development of renewable energies and shatter the multilateral Paris agreement of 2015. Opposition to climate science has become not just the badge of honour for far-right politicians like Ukip’s Paul Nuttall. It has become the central tenet of their appeal to unreason. People facing increased fuel bills, new taxes on methane-producing cattle farms, dimmer light bulbs and the arrival of wind and wave technologies in traditional landscapes will naturally ask: is this really needed? Their inner idiot wishes it were not. For most of us, the inner rationalist is strong enough to counteract that wish. What distinguishes the core of the rightwing populist electorate is its gullibility to idiocy-promoting rhetoric against climate science. They want to be harangued by a leader who tells them their racism is rational, in the same way they want leaders who tell them the science behind climate change is bunk. Well, in Australia, people are quickly finding out where such rhetoric gets you: more devastating bushfires; a longer fire season; more extreme hot days; longer droughts. And an energy grid so overloaded with demands from air conditioning systems that it is struggling to cope. And, iIf the pessimists among climate scientists are right, and the general rise in temperature has begun to destabilise and accentuate the El Niño effects, this is just the start. The world is reeling from the election victory of Donald Trump, who has called climate science a hoax. Dutch voters look set to reward Geert Wilders, whose one-page election programme promises “no more money for development, windmills, art, innovation or broadcasting”, with first place in the election. In France, 27% of voters are currently backing the Front National, a party determined to take the country out of the Paris accord, which it sees as “a communist project”. The struggle against the nationalist right must, in all countries, combine careful listening to the social and cultural grievances of those on its periphery with relentless stigmatisation of the idiocy, selfishness and racism of the leaders and political activists at its core. It’s time to overcome queasiness and restraint. We, the liberal and progressive people of the world, are at war with the far right to save the earth. The extreme temperatures and climate-related disasters of the past 24 months mean this is not some abstract struggle about science or values: it’s about the immediate fate of 60 million people still recovering from a disaster."
"The Great Barrier Reef faces an “elevated and imminent risk” of more widespread coral bleaching this year, the reef authority has warned the Queensland government. An alert from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority says more of the reef is showing built-up heat stress than this time last year, just before its worst-ever bleaching event killed off a quarter of all coral.  The authority is “concerned that a significant bleaching event may occur again this year”, when sea surface temperatures are also warmer than 12 months ago, the government briefing titled “2017 Coral Bleaching Event” says. It says the authority is “receiving increasing reports of coral bleaching and disease from many parts” of the reef, including offshore Mackay, far south of the worst sections of bleaching in 2016.  A new report to the UN’s world heritage committee by the Great Barrier Reef independent review group (IRG) has criticised Australia’s lack of planning in dealing with the effects of climate change on the reef. The review says mass bleaching has already crippled for decades a key goal of Australia’s 2050 reef conservation plan, having “substantially diminished the outstanding universal values” of the reef world heritage area. It says: “unprecedented severe bleaching and mortality of corals in 2016 in the Great Barrier Reef is a game changer”.  “Given the severity of the damage and the slow trajectory of recovery, the overarching vision of the 2050 Plan, to ensure the Great Barrier Reef continues to improve on its [outstanding universal values] every decade between now and 2050, is no longer attainable for at least the next two decades,” it says. The report also says Australia’s emission reduction targets are “not commensurate with a fair contribution to the reduced global carbon budget” needed to meet Paris agreement targets and protect coral reefs worldwide. It specifically criticises Australia’s support for new coal mines in Queensland that “pose a serious threat to the [world heritage area]”. Also on Friday, state and territory governments signed a joint statement calling on the Turnbull government to lift its urgency in cutting carbon emissions to meet Australia’s climate commitments. The communiqué was released before the Queensland environment and Great Barrier Reef minister, Steven Miles, was due to take state and territory counterparts to view damaged coral off Cairns.  It calls on the Turnbull government to use its review of Australia’s climate change policy to entrench a “bipartisan approach … which provides business, investors and society with certainty over Australia’s transition to a net zero emissions economy” by 2050. “We acknowledge the urgency of the need for action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and where possible to adapt to the impacts of climate change,” it says. It calls for “urgent and effective integration of energy and climate policy”, amid a continuing political brawl over the cost and reliability of switching power grids to renewable energy. Miles said the meeting, which the federal environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, declined to attend, involved a “very useful discussion about collaborating together to encourage stronger national action”. “Today I’ll show them why that work is so important. We are going to see the direct result of climate change in our reef waters,” he said. The alert from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, which is conducting underwater surveys of reefs between Townsville and Cairns, notes that the reef is under “repeated stress” through an “unusually warm winter and a second warm summer” after last year’s bleaching event. This has led to “more heat stress accumulated in more areas than at this time last year”, compounding the effects of sea surface temperatures also warmer than last year. “This accumulated stress means that many corals are likely to be more vulnerable than usual to the effects of elevated temperatures,” it says. Footage released this week by the production company Biopixel shows newly bleached corals at popular dive spots off Cairns. Richard Fitzpatrick, an Emmy-award winning cinematographer and marine biologist, says in the footage: “At the moment, we have no idea how severe or widespread this current coral bleaching event is going to be. “The causes of coral bleaching is simply climate change,” he says, before appealing to viewers, including those on “the other side of the planet”, to help end the reliance on fossil fuels “to help protect a living icon”.  Images of newly bleached corals were taken by divers near Palm Island, off Townsville, last week. Frydenberg told the ABC climate change was the reef’s greatest threat and the government was “concerned about heat stress on the reef but we are making real progress”. He said the implementation of measures worth more than $2bn towards the Reef 2050 Plan by the federal and Queensland government had already been “very successful”, with 30 of 105 measures completed. Frydenberg said Adani’s Carmichael mine, which would open up the Galilee Basin, was “300km inland and what we have done internationally and domestically to tackle climate change is significant”. The IRG said the government was “considering a $1bn subsidised loan” for a new rail line to open up the Galilee Basin to coal mines “that will add substantially to global greenhouse gas emissions”. “Despite the severe threat to the Great Barrier Reef of increased shipping, dredging and carbon emissions, Australia is still strongly supportive of developing the world’s largest new coal mines in the Galilee Basin,” it said. It also said the federal government had “underestimated” a funding shortfall of $143m to $408m to meet its Reef 2050 Plan actions. Up to a third of 103 actions flagged as “‘on track or underway’ are really just starting, or are seriously under-resourced”, it said. WWF-Australia’s head of oceans, Richard Leck, said: “These independent experts have given UNESCO a far more accurate assessment of progress than the rose-coloured-glasses version released by the Australian and Queensland governments late last year.” The reef campaign director for the Australian Marine Conservation Society, Imogen Zethoven, said the independent review was a “warning shot” for a reef “on a knife edge”. “Failure to act now will spell disaster for our reef. Scientists warn that we have four years left to have a 66% chance of keeping global temperature rise to no more than 1.5C,” she said.  “This is a critical threshold for the survival of the Great Barrier Reef and all the world’s reefs. The solutions are clear: we must ensure no new coal mines and we must urgently cut carbon pollution.”"
"First published on January 2nd, 2017 at Letters to the Revolution.   Dear Aurelia, I’m sorry. I am so, so sorry. My darling daughter, your generation is poised to inherit a world far more unstable, dangerous, and chaotic than your mother and I did. And the astounding election of Donald J Trump will only make this worse. Late on election night, when I finally realized Trump was going to be our next commander-in-chief, my first thought was: “My God, how will I tell Aurelia?” How do you explain to a five-year-old what just happened? Your mother and I did not hide this election from you, but talked openly about the kind of man Trump is and why the things he does and says are so wrong. We did not ignore the many questions from you, our curious kindergartner, but used them as a platform to talk about racism, sexism, democracy, and the simple importance of being kind to people. Raised by an environmental journalist and the manager of a nonprofit environmental newsite, you have been used to these kinds of frank conversations your whole life. So, I have a feeling you already suspect that what keeps daddy up most at night is global warming. There are few things we can be certain of entering the Age of Trump, but one is that the global momentum to tackle climate change will be slowed – maybe even halted – at the worst possible moment. Many of the President Elect’s decisions, including his cabinet appointments, already point to a hotter future world and a more acidified ocean. By the time your generation starts voting, marrying, and having children of your own you will be plunged into adapting to a new, more uncertain world – a world where Arctic sea ice might be all but gone, where desertification could be marching across the planet, where marine ecosystems like coral reefs may be collapsing altogether, and where seas will continue to swamp coastal and island people. You and your peers will face challenges as a society we can’t even imagine now. But Trump doesn’t understand any of this. Worse still, he willfully ignores any evidence that doesn’t paint himself as some sort of American redeemer. Trump is the most dangerous kind of person, Aurelia. One who views the entire world as a showcase for their own ego. Nothing is sacred to him, beyond plunder. Nothing matters, beyond projecting his own power over others.  And he is filling out his staff with similar types. Climate deniers are too kind a term for people that will be running the show. Earth devourers might be more accurate. And their intimacy with Russia – which has an economy almost wholly dependent on fossil fuels – could portend a unified strategy against any action to defend the world from rising climate chaos. But unlike our President-Elect and his ilk, we have to be clear-eyed about this my daughter. Lives, potentially millions of them, are at stake. The well being of billions is at stake. And the poor, the marginalized, the disenfranchised will be hurt first and foremost by our new, uglier climate. This goes even beyond humanity. Global warming is impacting every species on the planet, even down to the genetic level. Our world’s biodiversity – its vast richness of species – has already suffered widespread habitat destruction, dramatic over-hunting and fishing, invasive species, and pollution. Since 1970, we have wiped out more than half of the Earth’s wildlife populations. If we don’t rein in our fossil fuels and halt business-as-usual, we will see a mass extinction crisis – with untold impacts for the third planet from the sun. You and your peers have been betrayed, Aurelia. The baby boomers betrayed you by ignoring climate change, wildlife collapse, and environmental destruction for decades. Bowing before neo-liberal economics, they chose materialism and consumerism over the preservation of life on Earth. Generation X has proven little better. What the millennials will do – I don’t know. But your generation will inherit our decades of dawdling, broken politics, cowardice, and moral bankruptcy. With such a rotted endowment, never let anyone tell you that “we just didn’t know”. The information was out there, Aurelia – the fallout was clear for decades – we just didn’t act. We allowed ourselves to be lulled into complacency by liars, plunderers, and propagandists – many of whom are now in the Trump administration. As a society, we cared more about trite entertainment and owning lots of stuff than giving you the kind of world children deserve. Still, hope is not lost, Aurelia. I know that because of you – one cannot raise a child so curious, strong, and loving without having a kind of hope and optimism infuse their being. Climate change and ecological destruction presents us with an opportunity – an opportunity to create a more just and fair world, a world where humans live within ecological limits, where our economy no longer plunders nature for endless growth, where we respect the lives of other species.  Climate chaos will try to pull us even further apart. We can’t let it. We must use this crisis to come together, to unify globally as brothers and sisters and not devolve into an endless series of conflicts spurred by scarcity. We need to stand up in the face of global warming and say: you won’t ruin us. We will fight and we will make a better world out of it. In this, you would not be alone, my daughter. Already, there are so many examples of heroism in this world – and if any good comes out of the Trump administration it will be that such examples increase daily. The ‘water protectors’ of North Dakota are just such an example – bravely facing off against those who would risk their resources, their culture and our collective future. And there are the thousands of Bangladeshis marching against a coal plant on the edge of the Sundarbans or the Kichwa tribe of the Ecuadorean Amazon daily battling oil drilling. There is Pope Francis calling climate change a “sin against God” and nearly 200 world leaders who have signed on to the Paris agreement, many of whom I believe were sincere. Take such heroes as your example, those who speak out, march, or resist nonviolently. Of course, not everyone is a born activist, so remember that societal change happens through a billion actions every day. It can be as simple as a candid conversation with family or neighbors to reaching out to your representatives. And don’t neglect yourself: find the courage to question and test your own beliefs and the even greater courage to embody your ethics. Most importantly, keep your compassion: for your seven billion fellow humans of course, but also for the tiny – the grasshopper springing leaf to leaf – and the large – the whale breaching the sea’s surface. Even, as Jesus said, for your enemies. Trump is just a man, one imprisoned by his own fear, hate, and hunger for power. We should give Donald J Trump, the individual, our compassion – for who would want to live in his battered soul? – even as we fight President Trump and all he stands for. When you came into our room morning after the election, all bright and excited as usual, we told you the only way we knew how: sometimes bullies win. Sometimes bad people get power. Sometimes a man who cares about nothing more than his own aggrandizement becomes president. But your mom and dad will fight along with millions of others. We will do everything in our power to make a difference. History is long, Aurelia, and we have but one lifetime to shape it for the better. In the meantime, your job is to play, to learn, to grow. One day you and your generation will inherit this world. And I think it will be the better for it. With all my love, Your Father  This letter was written as part of Letters to the Revolution, an on-line platform where leading artists and activists from marginalized communities were asked to write letters of strength and focus in light of the upcoming administration.

"Ministers should establish a new energy commission to spur on construction of power stations because successive governments have failed to encourage enough fresh power capacity in the UK, according to a House of Lords report. Subsidy-backed growth in renewable energy projects, such as windfarms, has deterred the construction of new conventional power plants, the economic affairs committee claimed.   The peers envisage the new energy commission would oversee auctions where all technologies, including fossil fuel power plants, competed for guaranteed electricity prices. The auctions would cap carbon emissions. At present the government only allows low-carbon power, such as windfarms and new nuclear power stations, to compete in auctions for such deals, known as contracts for difference. The influential cross-party group of peers concluded that successive governments have got their priorities wrong on energy policy by giving priority to carbon emissions cuts – a statutory duty under the Climate Change Act – over keeping costs down and keeping the lights on. The report has sparked an angry response. Robert Gross, director of the centre for energy policy and technology at Imperial College, London, said: “The term ‘post truth’ has become over-used. Yet it would be possible to take all the evidence the committee presents and tell a completely different story: there’s been huge success in growing renewables and reducing emissions from the power sector.” Lord Hollick, the committee’s chair, said: “We are critical of the drift that’s taken place over the last 15 years or so, which has delivered on the decarbonisation agenda but very much at the expense of consumers paying 58% more than they were in 2003. On the affordability front we haven’t looked after consumers.”  However, as the report acknowledges, most of the price increases came from higher gas prices, not the 10% added by renewable energy subsidies.  The peers, who include the former chancellor Norman Lamont, and a former head of the civil service, Andrew Turnbull, said security of supply should become the key aim of energy policy, above decarbonisation and cost.  “Low-carbon but chronically unreliable electricity is not acceptable. Similarly very cheap prices at the expense of frequent shortages would be unacceptable,” the report says, which also claims fossil fuels have remained cheaper than renewable sources. But Paul Massara, the former chief executive of npower who now runs the renewable energy firm North Star Solar, said the committee was simply wrong to say fossil fuels were always cheaper than renewables, and condemned the report as “backward looking”. Darren Baxter, a researcher at the Institute for Public Policy Research thinktank, said: “A failure to keep the pace up with decarbonisation, as suggested in this report, would be a disaster for the north [of England] and its growing low-carbon economy.” Hollick told the Guardian that the government had micromanaged the energy market and did not need to interfere as much. He said the government “should now allow the energy commission to move forward, to run auctions, to fill the gap and to build a properly balanced [energy system]”. Hollick denied the report was anti-renewables. “Exactly the opposite. We see renewables very much as the way forward,” he said, arguing that more public money should go into R&D in renewables and energy storage. The committee also urged the government to publish its plan B if the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station, which is expected to provide 7% of the UK’s electricity from 2025, is delayed or even cancelled. Hollick said the biggest surprise during the committee’s inquiry was the “fragility” of the government’s nuclear ambitions, which envisage new nuclear reactors in Somerset, Suffolk, Anglesey and Cumbria. “It is imperative that the government publishes it contingency plans for how it will make up the capacity due to be provided by these plants in the event one or more does not succeed or is delayed,” the report says.  Hollick said he expected the government’s energy back-up plan to be made up largely of new gas power stations and offshore windfarms. A spokeswoman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: “Keeping the lights on is non-negotiable. Our top priority is making sure UK families and businesses have secure, affordable energy supplies.”"
"The deep ocean and the creatures that live there are facing a desperate future due to food shortages and changing temperatures, according to research exploring the impact of climate change and human activity on the world’s seas. The deep ocean plays a critical role in sustaining our fishing and removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, as well as being home to a huge array of creatures. But the new study reveals that food supplies at the seafloor in the deepest regions of the ocean could fall by up to 55% by 2100, starving the animals and microbes that exist there, while changes in temperature, pH and oxygen levels are also predicted to take their toll on fragile ecosystems. The situation, the authors note, is exacerbated by drilling for oil and gas, dumping of pollutants, fishing and the prospect of deep-sea mining.  “We need to wake up and start really realising that [with] the deep ocean, even though we can’t see it … we are going to be having a huge effect on the largest environment on the planet,” said Andrew Sweetman, the co-author of the research from Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh. “It is pretty scary.” Published in the journal Elementa by an international group of scientists from 20 research institutes, the study describes how the team harnessed a number of climate models to explore how oceans around the world are set to change over the 21st century. “We wanted to look at how all of these combined stressors – warming, enhanced acidification, reduced food supply to the sea floor, deoxygenation – would work together to impact the ocean,” said Sweetman.  The results reveal that the future for the deep sea is bleak. By 2100 ocean conditions will have changed dramatically, say the authors, with so-called bathyal depths (waters reaching roughly 200 metres to 3,000 metres in depth) in the Pacific, Atlantic and Arctic Oceans increasing in temperature by up to 4C. The seafloor of even deeper ocean regions, known as abyssal depths ranging from 3,000 metres to 6,000 metres deep, could increase in temperature by up to 0.5C to 1C. Warming oceans are expected to result in lower oxygen concentrations, with levels predicted to fall in bathyal seafloor habitats by up to 3.7%. But even small changes, said Sweetman, could have a large impact, resulting in disruptions to fragile ecosystems that exist on the fringes of regions with very low oxygen.  Rising levels of carbon dioxide, says the study, will cause waters to become more acidic – a situation that is likely to be disastrous for organisms with shells, such as molluscs, as well as corals, while fish and other creatures will also be affected.  Concentration of organic matter in the deep ocean is also expected to drop dramatically by 2100, reducing the amount of food available for organisms that thrive at such depths. But food is already scarce. “The food supply these animals derive energy from in the abyss at 4,000-metre depths is equivalent to a sugar cube per square metre per year,” said Sweetman.  The worst hit, say the authors, will be the Indian Ocean, whose depths are expected to experience a drop in available food of up to 55%. “The only way the ecosystem is going to respond is by some animals dying off,” said Sweetman. While the team note that in some regions of the world’s oceans temperatures may cool, the impact is still expected to be negative. “Animals living on the deep sea floor are relatively isolated from environmental change,” said Sweetman. “Most of the animals have adapted strategies for living under constant environmental conditions where the oxygen doesn’t change over hundreds of years, the temperature doesn’t change over hundreds to thousands of years.” Given the large changes expected to occur by the end of the century, Sweetman said, “It is very unlikely that they are going to be able to adapt.” As far as is known, Sweetman said, change is happening faster than at any previous point in geological history. “The rate of change is so dramatic that we run the risk of severely disrupting the deep ocean – which covers most of the planet’s surface,” he said. The authors point out that human activity in the oceans is likely to make matters worse, citing a rise in fishing and the dumping of pollutants as well as the burgeoning interest in deep-sea mining. “Many of the areas that will be targeted for resource extraction lie in areas that will be most heavily impacted by climate change,” the authors note.  Adrian Glover, an expert in deep oceans from the Natural History Museum in London who was not involved in the research, welcomed the study.  “It must be stressed, however, that actual data on changes in deep-sea ecosystems are extremely scarce,” he said. While the study offers clear evidence that climate change will affect temperature, acidity, and other factors, “It is still in the realms of speculation as to what the impact would be on biodiversity, for example,” said Glover. A key challenge, Glover said, is to conduct studies to explore the current state of the deep sea and the creatures that live there. “To observe and monitor changes in our deep oceans, we need a vastly improved library of biodiversity information – a baseline upon which to measure change – and new scientific programs for understanding the fundamental ecology of the deep sea.”"

"It always hits me in the gut first. I often feel it first thing, my stomach twisted in a knot, my brain deciding it doesn’t want to deal with the day before I even wake up.  Sometimes my anxiety will fester around a particular thing – a cascade of worry about my work, health, social life, or often a simple decision I have to make. This worry becomes totally paralysing, with hours spent focusing on nothing else but this one issue. At other times the anxiety hits for no reason, a desperate feeling of dread that I cannot explain, nor wash away no matter how much I try.  Over the past couple of years I’ve come to terms with the reality of my anxiety disorder – moving from seeing myself as someone who has anxious moments to realising I have a mental health condition. In many ways it has been liberating, largely because in owning the illness I’ve been able to start dealing with it. I visit a psychologist, who is doing a great job at helping me manage my anxious events. Yet at the same time, recognising this problem has also been challenging. While I’ve been able to deal with the symptoms, I continue to struggle to find the cause – a process that is taking me down a rabbit hole of realisation of the depth of this illness.  Consult the growing medical discourse around anxiety and you will get an increasingly clear picture of what causes the disorder. Beyond Blue states that factors such as a genetic predisposition, personality traits, the existence of stressful events, physical health problems and substance abuse can all lead to an anxiety disorder. Other research has also found biological causes, with an imbalance of certain neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine and epinephrine in the brain likely being a trigger.  This research provides an essential picture of the nature of this growing epidemic – confirming anxiety as a core mental health issue and not just an “everyday event” that we all go through. For me it has created some comfort. I have a familial history of mental health problems, and at the times when I’m inexplicably paralysed with anxious thoughts it is often useful to tell myself that my neurotransmitters are simply firing a little funny that day. Yet it’s also clear that anxiety disorders are something much bigger than a simple biological condition. As I’ve become increasingly comfortable talking about my anxiety, one of the things that has been most striking has been the realisation of how common it is. For my cohort – Generation Y – it increasingly feels as though anxiety disorders are more common than not. The list I have of my friends with different forms of the disorder grows longer all the time, leading me to ask, why is it that this plagues so many of my generation? I’ve managed to understand this by thinking about anxiety as a stressful event. As noted before, stressful life events – whether it is the loss of a job, the death of a family member, or the breakdown of a relationship – are one of the major causes of anxiety disorders. What’s changing is that these events are becoming a continuous existence for an entire generation. Increasing job insecurity, housing stress, economic and income instability, and a future of climate change, environmental destruction and conflict, have turned stress – and in turn anxiety – into a way of life. Just as significant stressful events are shown to cause anxiety disorders, research suggests that this long-term stress has a similar impact. For example, research from the University of Michigan found in 2009 that stress from job insecurity is worse for your mental health than unemployment. Similar data has been found regarding housing, with research from the Swinburne-Monash Research Centre finding a strong correlation between different forms of housing insecurity and mental health problems such as anxiety. Many researchers also believe that when it comes to climate change we are undergoing “a collective anxiety that is insidious, even if we haven’t managed to connect all the dots”.  But it is even more complex than this. These material conditions are met with what Richard Eckersley calls a “western cultural crisis” – a breakdown of communal structures that are important for our mental wellbeing. Whether it is the commercialisation of public space or increasing working hours that reduce time for social activity, we live in a society in which we are all increasingly socially isolated and lonely, destroying one of the key mechanisms available to protect against mental anguish. Anxiety disorders are not just medical problems. They are inherently social illnesses, ones that are becoming more of an issue as economic insecurity increases and social connections are destroyed. But herein lies the challenge. Facing this epidemic we now have a dilemma. How can we deal with these huge social causes while at the same time support and protect those who are suffering from the illness here and now?  This is a fine balance, but one we have not managed to find. Michael Currie for example comments that we hardly even deal with the causes of anxiety when trying to treat it, stating that, “Anxiety-as-disease is treated much like an infection, as if the symptoms were a bacterium that should be eradicated.” NGO campaigns are very similar, with awareness programs, which dominate the sector, working primarily in an after-the-fact approach.  This is not to say that these approaches have no value. Doctors and psychologists, for example, can only deal with an illness as it is presented to them. I can say from first-hand experience these approaches are extremely useful in helping deal with the disorder. Yet, as we face this epidemic we must also confront the social conditions behind it. Economic, income, and housing insecurity, alongside the plague of social isolation, is causing a generational mental health crisis, primarily situated in anxiety disorders. Finding long-term solutions therefore can only occur when we are willing to tackle these social causes. I do not know exactly what this balance looks like. But if we really want to solve our anxiety epidemic we have to think of solutions that look at the causes of the problem, and not just the symptoms. Otherwise we face a whole generation or more plagued by this illness."
"Every few years the fossil fuel industry pressures politicians to force “clean coal”, carbon capture and storage (CCS) and more recently coal seam gas (CSG) on an increasingly sceptical community to justify its continued expansion. This cycle started with the promotion of Adani’s massive Carmichael coalmine in Queensland, for coal export to India. The South Australian blackout followed last September when violent storms blew down transmission towers, prompting instant federal government accusations that excessive reliance on renewable energy was the cause, despite clear advice to the contrary. This also prompted a review of the energy system, led by Dr Alan Finkel, with final submissions due on Friday.  Then, when the long-overdue closure of the Hazelwood brown-coal power station was announced in November, energy security became a political battleground. In passing, Adani was to be offered a $1bn subsidy to construct the Carmichael rail line, and then a further subsidy for a new domestic coal-fired power plant at the mine was mooted to assist the development of northern Australia.  The prime minister’s National Press Club speech in January emphasised the need for “affordable, reliable and secure energy”, denounced the states for their “unrealistic” renewable targets, encouraged energy storage – and then took an evangelical swing back to coal, straight from the fossil fuel industry hymn book. Priority would be given to “clean coal, and carbon capture and storage (CCS and onshore gas (CSG)”, implying that renewables were neither affordable or reliable.  He continued: “The next incarnation of our energy policy should be technology-agnostic – it’s security and cost that matter, not how you deliver it. Policy should be ‘all of the above technologies’ working together to meet the trifecta of secure and affordable power while meeting our substantial emission reduction commitments.” So what could possibly be wrong with such a sweeping vision? Well, pretty much everything. Firstly, the speech skirted around the biggest risk facing Australia, namely accelerating climate change. While Australia ratified the Paris climate agreement, our emission reduction commitments are not “substantial”. They are laughable, both in comparison with our peers globally and to have any chance of making a fair contribution to the Paris objectives of holding global temperatures “well below 2C above pre-industrial conditions and to pursue efforts to limit the increase to 1.5C”. Then, to have a realistic chance, say 90%, of meeting the Paris objectives, the world should no longer emit any carbon to the atmosphere. We still emit record amounts today and need some fossil fuels to build the new low-carbon economy, so that is not going to happen. But emissions must peak and decline rapidly. There is no space for any new fossil fuel projects – coal, oil or gas. “Clean coal” is neither new nor clean. These technologies can reduce emissions by up to 40% relative to conventional practice but that does not solve our problem when the global carbon budget has already been exhausted. Furthermore, costs are increased by up to 30%, rendering coal even less competitive with renewables. Years of research have failed to establish the basis for CCS expansion at scale. CCS works where emissions are stored in depleted oil and gas reservoirs, which the oil industry has practised for decades. Storage in other types of geological structures is far harder. The few commercial operations in the world today are in the former category. The substantial additional costs of CCS again reduce coal’s competitiveness, particularly if you refuse to price carbon, as the government is doing. CCS will be useful at the margin but it will not save fossil fuels from their inevitable demise.  Additionally, energy prices rose largely because our flawed regulatory framework allowed power companies to invest in unnecessary infrastructure on which they were guaranteed a return. Gas prices rose because the east coast was opened up to the higher-priced international gas market with the construction of export facilities at Gladstone. The unseemly rush into CSG resulted in substantial processing overcapacity, with economic pressure increasing as CSG production was constrained by community objection to the damage caused to arable land and water. Furthermore, high methane leakage rates result in CSG having a greater warming effect than using coal, thereby negating its supposed benefit. Finally, there is nothing “agnostic” about choosing energy sources when the fossil fuel industry continues to enjoy a massive subsidy, far greater than renewables, through the lack of carbon pricing – a subsidy the IMF estimates to be about 60% of coal’s market price. And this is the nub of the problem. Our climate and energy policies are a disconnected and dysfunctional shambles, brought about by years of denial and inaction from federal governments of both persuasions who do not accept that climate change is happening. But that game is up. Climate change has moved from the twilight phase of much talk and relatively limited impact. It is now turning nasty. Events are moving faster than expected as irreversible climate tipping points are crossed. The economic and social costs of inaction can no longer be swept under the carpet, with regulators here and overseas demanding action to head off a climate-induced financial crisis. The only way we can avoid catastrophic climate impact now is to initiate emergency action, akin to being on a war footing. That will be accepted shortly as impacts bite and low-carbon technology undermines the fossil fuel industry. In the meantime the damage created by political ideologues must be minimised, so no Adani, no coal-fired power, no CSG.  Our antiquated electricity grids are undoubtedly in need of overhaul but 100% renewable energy grids are being constructed around the world in only a few years, providing genuine energy security and making traditional concepts of baseload power irrelevant. This is innovation at its best. As for affordability, energy prices will rise, given the extent and speed of change. But they will rise less with renewables than with coal, with greater prospects of cost reduction as technology improves.  We need a new narrative, built around our potential to prosper as a low-carbon society. We have the world’s best renewable resources, the science, technology and engineering expertise to seize what is the biggest investment and job-creation opportunity this country has ever seen.  In addition, we need a taskforce which will pull together the resources and expertise required to initiate emergency action, led by statesmen and women from businesses with a concern to create a genuinely sustainable Australia. It is their future which is being thrown away by fossil fuel industry pressure forcing government to remain firmly entrenched in the 20th century."
" Donald Trump has begun the process of rolling back carbon pollution standards for vehicles following a meeting with automakers in Detroit, Michigan.   Trump has directed the Environmental Protection Agency to review fuel efficiency standards that were a key plank of Barack Obama’s effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The move is a victory for carmakers who have claimed the standards are too onerous and out of step with Americans’ car buying habits. “These standards are costly for automakers and the American people,” said the EPA administrator, Scott Pruitt. “We will work with our partners at the department of transport to take a fresh look to determine if this approach is realistic. This thorough review will help ensure that this national program is good for consumers and good for the environment.” In an agreement struck with automakers in 2012, the Obama administration required that cars run 54.4 miles per gallon of fuel by 2025. This standard, up from 27.5 miles per gallon, would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6bn tons over the lifetime of new vehicles and save 2m gallons of oil per day by 2025.  In the final month of Obama’s presidency, the EPA affirmed in a midterm review that automakers are “well positioned” to meet the new standard. Trump is ordering a review of this finding, opening the way for a weaker standard to be drawn up. The White House said the new review will “rely on the best available data and information, which the previous administration ignored”.  A White House official said the automakers feel the EPA “shoved it down their throats” and that the standards needed to be redone.  “The process was very short-circuited,” said the Trump official, who spoke anonymously before the president’s announcement. “There was a lot of data that was submitted, and I think it is fair to say the Obama EPA just ignored it.”  Trump unveiled the review at an event in Detroit where he met with executives from companies, including General Motors, Ford and Fiat. The president said he was going to “bring a lot of jobs back to Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania”. Dennis Williams, president of the United Auto Workers union, raised concerns about the environmental impact of more loose fuel efficiency standards. In response, Trump said: “We all agree with you 100%. One hundred percent. We want you to make great cars, but if it takes an extra thimble of fuel, we want you to do it.”   Former EPA officials and environmental groups have decried the reversal, pointing out that carmakers had previously complained about fuel efficiency standards only to easily meet the requirements due to the evolution of technology. There are already more than 100 car and SUV models that meet standards that stretch beyond 2020, with the Chevrolet Volt, Toyota Prius, Chevrolet Spark and Smart ForTwo already matching the 2025 standard.   American drivers are also set to lose out, with the Obama rules forecast to save an average of $8,000 on gasoline costs for a new car.  “We need to put clean car standards in the fast lane to keep our air clean and our climate safe,” said Michael Brune, executive director of environmental group, the Sierra Club. “Donald Trump and the automakers are endangering the health of our children and families by abolishing lifesaving vehicle emissions protections that cut down on dangerous smog pollution and asthma attacks.” Kristin Igusky, climate program associate at the World Resources Institute, added: “There’s no doubt that the current standards are reasonable and achievable. In fact, the industry as a whole has surpassed the vehicle standards in each of the last four years, while creating jobs and selling more vehicles than ever.” Carmakers welcomed the review. Mitch Bainwol, president and chief executive of trade lobby group, Auto Alliance, said: “By restarting this review, analysis rather than politics will produce a final decision.”  Trump’s rolling back of fuel efficiency standards is set to be followed by further actions to dismantle climate policies enacted by Obama. The administration is set to lift a moratorium on coalmining on federal land and start to unpick various climate rules, including the Clean Power Plan, which imposes emissions limits on the states.  Trump is also mulling whether to withdraw the US from the Paris climate accord. On Wednesday, an alliance of 1,000 US companies took out ads in Washington DC publications to urge Trump to stay in the deal and work towards a low-carbon economy.  The group, which includes Mars, General Mills and Ikea, warned that “failure to tackle climate change could put America’s economic prosperity at risk”."
"Scott Pruitt, Donald Trump’s head of the US Environmental Protection Agency, has dismissed a basic scientific understanding of climate change by denying that carbon dioxide emissions are a primary cause of global warming. Pruitt said on Thursday that he did not believe that the release of CO2, a heat-trapping gas, was pushing global temperatures upwards.   “I think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do and there’s tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact, so no, I would not agree that it’s a primary contributor to the global warming that we see,” he told CNBC.  “But we don’t know that yet ... We need to continue the debate and continue the review and the analysis.”  This stance puts Pruitt at odds with his own agency, which states on its website that carbon dioxide is the “primary greenhouse gas that is contributing to recent climate change”. This finding is backed by Nasa, which calls CO2 “the most important long-lived ‘forcing’ of climate change”.  Scientists have understood for more than a century that CO2 traps heat. Atmospheric concentrations of the gas have increased by more than a third since the industrial revolution, driven by the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation.   The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report from 2014, which summarized the findings of 2,000 international scientists, states it is “extremely likely” that the steep rise in CO2, along with other greenhouse gases such as methane, has caused most of the global warming experienced since the 1950s.  Pruitt’s comments were quickly condemned by scientists, environmental activists and even his immediate predecessor as EPA chief, Gina McCarthy.  “The world of science is about empirical evidence, not beliefs,” said McCarthy, an appointee of Barack Obama. “When it comes to climate change, the evidence is robust and overwhelmingly clear that the cost of inaction is unacceptably high.  “I cannot imagine what additional information the administrator might want from scientists for him to understand that.”  Kevin Trenberth, senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said: “Pruitt has demonstrated that he is unqualified to run the EPA or any agency. There is no doubt whatsoever that the planet is warming, and it is primarily due to increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from burning of fossil fuels.   “Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas and we can demonstrate clearly that the observed warming of the planet would not have occurred without that change in atmospheric composition. These are scientific facts, not opinion, and it is incumbent on politicians to take account of the scientific evidence.”  Pruitt has previously equivocated on the issue of climate change, telling his Senate confirmation hearing that while he accepts the world is warming it is “hard to measure with precision” the human influence.  A core EPA function is the regulation of greenhouse gases, including CO2. Pruitt, in his previous role as attorney general of Oklahoma, sued the EPA to halt Obama’s Clean Power Plan, which imposes emissions limits on coal-fired power plants. The plan, similar to many of the other Obama-era policies to combat climate change and safeguard clean air and water, is likely to be dismantled by the Trump administration. The president has previously called the EPA a “disgrace” and promised to reduce it to “tidbits” in order to spark economic growth.  The EPA faces severe cuts under a proposed White House budget proposal, with Pruitt set to review the agency’s role in vehicle emissions standards, methane emissions and protection of America’s waterways.   Pruitt sued the EPA 14 times while attorney general of Oklahoma and has worked in concert with fossil fuel interests in many of these cases. The recent release of thousands of Pruitt’s emails during his tenure showed an extremely close relationship between Pruitt’s office and oil and gas companies.  The EPA administrator has insisted that the regulator does work that could be delegated to the states, has overreached and needs to be reined in.   “There are a lot of changes that need to take place at my agency to restore the rule of law and federalism,” Pruitt said last month."

"Australian scientists are studying air pollution and cloud formation in Antarctica in an effort to understand how non-carbon aerosolised particles impact on global temperatures. It’s the first comprehensive study of the composition and concentration of aerosols in the Antarctic sea ice area, a region that influences cloud formation and weather patterns for much of the southern hemisphere. The impact that aerosolised particles have on the global climate is one of the biggest unknowns in climate science, said a CSIRO scientist, Dr Ruhi Humphries. The particles are formed by molecules clumping together to form groups of between one nanometre and 10 microns. Non-carbon particles reflect light and in some cases seed clouds, causing a localised cooling effect. “You have warming effect caused by greenhouse gasses and the cooling effect caused by aerosols, and climate change is basically the difference between the two,” Humphries said. Unlike greenhouse gases, which take a long time to break down in the upper atmosphere, aerosols disperse fairly quickly and have a shorter effect. Because the process is poorly understood, it’s difficult to model the cooling impact increased aerosols caused by air pollution have on global temperatures. Paradoxically, Humphries said, cleaning up industries could cause a reduction in localised cooling processes.  “As you improve how you burn your fossil fuels, you are producing less soot and less sulfur,” he said. “The sulfur is the big one. As you go to low sulphur fuels, you reduce the sulfur that actually produces those aerosols that reflect the sunlight.” It’s hoped that understanding how aerosolised particles form and behave in Antarctica, one of the least polluted places on the planet, will provide a baseline for understanding how the process works in more populated areas. “It’s this really nice test place for normal atmospheric processes,” Humphries said. The project is being conducted with Jack Simmons, a PhD student on board the CSIRO research ship Investigator, which departed Hobart for a 51-day voyage last month. Instruments on the ship have taken continuous readings of atmospheric conditions since it left port on 14 January, and researchers will overlay that data with the ship’s mapping systems to create an accurate picture of aerosol dispersal from Tasmania to the Sabrina Coast. It is the most detailed set of observations ever taken in this region of Antarctica. “We are trying to understand what the aerosolised particles are made of and what they look like, and their size and composition,” Humphries said. “That will funnel into how they interact with clouds, how they interact with radiation, and where they go.” The information will allow scientists to create more accurate modelling, but Humphries said the number of variables involved in the process meant that manipulating aerosols to artificially manufacture cooler temperatures was “not a viable option”. "
"If you’ve watched the inglorious spectacle of the failure of Australian politics on climate and energy policy over the last 10 years, it’s a bit hard to look out on the wreckage without feeling sick to the stomach. But look we must and, if we look now, we are able to chart the consequences of abject failure in highly specific ways.  What Australians are experiencing now – rising prices, rising emissions and a grid that creaks and sputters in extreme weather – is the logical consequence of a decade of unconscionable public policy failure. This isn’t some freak accident that’s been visited on the country, we are not the unwitting victims of a natural disaster that has blown in unexpectedly. We are reaping now precisely what has been sown. Everybody wears a share of the blame in this debacle – Kevin Rudd for putting Malcolm Turnbull in a corner in 2009 and then dithering when decisiveness was required; the Greens for voting down one carbon trading scheme because it was too favourable to polluters then voting for another one that was actually marginally more favourable to them – but, if there was a gold medal for blame, you’d give it to Tony Abbott. Abbott used climate policy to wrest the leadership of conservative politics from Turnbull, then he doubled down on stupid with his hyperventilating, eardrum-splitting, “axe the tax” bollocks. Abbott’s chief of staff, Peta Credlin, has recently admitted that fight was manufactured, that the whole shrieking bunfight was, in essence, an opportunity crime. “It wasn’t a carbon tax, as you know. It was many other things in nomenclature terms but we made it a carbon tax,” Credlin said on Sky News in mid-February. “We made it a fight about the hip pocket and not about the environment. That was brutal retail politics and it took Abbott about six months to cut through and, when he cut through, Gillard was gone.” Enough about the environment, more about Tony, and Tony’s brains trust. Inspirational stuff, right? And, as usual, the joke of whack-a-mole hyperpartisan politics, is squarely on us. You can feel the fatigue and frustration right around the energy sector, the business community and climate activists but the Finkel review is presenting fresh opportunity to right past wrongs. A range of stakeholders have rallied to have a go at trying to get sense from their elected representatives. The energy sector and big energy users are very clear about what’s gone wrong and what we need to do to fix it. If we summarise their views, they tell us the lack of a stable, bipartisan policy framework has created an investment strike in big generation assets at a time when some of our coal-fired power stations are reaching the end of their operating life. A consequential gap is now opening up before us. Power companies work on planning horizons of 30 and 40 years, not the shallow dips and dives of politics. Energy companies have found themselves in an invidious position: they know that, over the medium term, policymakers will impose rules requiring them to reduce emissions but they don’t know what the rules are. They are forced to guess, with billion-dollar assets. Coupled with those problems, the gas market is “dysfunctional”, as senior executives from AGL put it this week. Prices are soaring. Supply on the east coast of Australia is tight. AGL told a Senate inquiry things were currently so dire the company was considering building its own LNG hub in Queensland to help secure reliable gas supply downstream – a development climate policy veteran and respected economic professor Ross Garnaut characterised quite reasonably as “nuts”. While the Turnbull government in Canberra has been bloviating up a storm about renewables, and intermittency problems, to try and manufacture a fresh, shallow, partisan point of difference with Labor, the energy sector and business groups have been clear that gas is a more pressing present issue. Why is gas an issue? Partly because we currently export two-thirds of our product, partly because the market isn’t competitive enough and partly because the states have locked gas down in response to political activism. The lock the gate campaigns have put the Nationals astride the barbed wire fence in the bush, which makes it hard for a Coalition government to argue forcefully in favour of turning the supply tap on (although, in fairness to the energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, he has been attempting to run that gauntlet). There are also different views inside the government on the merits of a domestic gas reservation, which would ringfence a percentage of gas supply for local use. The gas industry doesn’t care for it. Perhaps that’s why we’ve heard more about renewables and about “clean” coal (a technology that looms regularly in the energy debate like a unicorn, despite the fact experts tell us it won’t be commercially viable before 2030 and is not financeable without substantial government intervention) and less about gas. The Australian energy market operator on Thursday did the equivalent of grasping politicians by the lapels and shouting in close proximity to their face. AEMO has warned declining gas production could, on current indications, result in a shortfall of gas-powered electricity generation impacting on New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia from the summer of 2018-19. Some in the industry think we might not get to summer, that the gas shortages may manifest in the winter. A week ago, the Australian Workers Union asked the prime minister to sit down with the gas companies to fix what is a blindingly obvious problem. Turnbull said on Thursday he would call a meeting of east coast gas company chief executives. Energy companies want more than a polite conversation with the prime minister. Their strategic thinking is clear when it comes to the national electricity market. They want a clear market signal, they want clear rules to govern an orderly transition to secure energy with less emissions. They want considered intervention by the government. They do not want another round of whack-a-mole. The country cannot afford another round of whack-a-mole. Yet, in Canberra, the Turnbull government has shown every sign of revving its engines for another manufactured political fight. The government has already ruled out pursuing the specific market signal that pretty much everyone says we need to drive the transition in orderly fashion at comparatively least cost to energy users – an emissions intensity scheme. Now why has this happened? Because Abbott and a bunch of conservatives with operatic feelpinions didn’t like it and Christopher Pyne saw opportunity to run another “axe the tax” campaign at the next election. A carbon trading scheme is only one component of the required policy changes. But the early panicked decision on the intensity scheme means the government has sent the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, off with a hunting licence to fix the problem, with one hand tied behind his back. It has taken a long time in this country to build any sort of durable industry consensus behind carbon pricing and, just when it appears, the government chooses not to take advantage. Stakeholders no longer care. They are laying out their rationale. If that strands the government, so be it. Turnbull says very often he wants to take the ideology out of energy and focus on practical solutions. It’s an excellent sentiment and it’s past time for him to actually get serious about it."

"The South African government has lost the country’s first climate change lawsuit after the hight court ruled against its plans for a coal-fired power station, the latest in a rising tide of international climate litigation. Environmental NGO EarthLife Africa challenged the government’s approval of the proposed Thabametsi coal-fired power station on the grounds that it should have been preceded by an evaluation of its climate change impacts. The North Gauteng high court agreed and ordered the government to reconsider its approval, taking into account a full climate change impact assessment.  A draft assessment shows that the project slated for the drought-prone Limpopo province will produce significant greenhouse gas emissions, and that the climate impacts threaten the future viability of the plant.  The case comes shortly after a groundbreaking climate case decided last month in Austria. A federal court blocked the expansion of Vienna’s international airport because the increase in carbon emissions that a new runway would generate is inconsistent with Austria’s commitments to tackle climate change. The Austrian decision not only echoes controversies around airport expansions in the UK and France; it’s also the latest example of courts around the world stepping in to hold governments to account for escalating global temperatures. Since a landmark Dutch climate change case, filed by my colleagues, resulted in an order that the government significantly reduce its carbon emissions, lawsuits challenging inaction on climate change have been filed in courtrooms in Europe, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region. Some lawsuits target the inadequacy of policies intended to reduce carbon emissions (as in the US, New Zealand, Belgium and Switzerland) while others challenge individual projects that have potentially catastrophic consequences for the climate (as in Norway, where the government has permitted new drilling for oil in the Arctic).  In Pakistan, where rising temperatures are already threatening lives and livelihoods, a court found in favour of a farmer who argued that his rights to life and dignity were under threat because of the government’s inadequate climate change policy. Climate change litigation is an invaluable strategy at a time when governments have failed to live up to their repeated promises, affirmed most recently in the Paris agreement, to prevent dangerous interference with the climate system. Current pledges to reduce emissions are projected to lead to warming of 3.2C above pre-industrial levels – way above the agreed target of “well below 2C” and likely to lead to radical changes in the environment. Aside from highlighting the obligations of governments to protect their citizens from foreseeable harm, these cases have the considerable advantage of putting the facts of climate change on the public record. These facts, endorsed by governments through the adoption of scientific reports at the UN, include that climate change is real; that it is caused by human activity; that it will dramatically affect every region in the world; and that it is more cost-effective to act now than later. While it might be expedient for politicians to obfuscate these facts, it is another matter altogether to produce evidence to substantiate their position in court. The political and social ripple effects of climate change cases are also enormous. While the Dutch government is appealing against the court’s ruling in the Netherlands, the case has already had a huge impact on national policy making and public debate.  Emboldened by the ruling, opposition MPs have drafted a new, more ambitious climate change act and a majority of parliamentarians have voted to phase out coal-fired power as quickly as possible. It has also catalysed an unprecedented level of social mobilisation around climate change as an issue. These cases are powerful vehicles for the progressive action on climate that is urgently needed. Far from being an undue interference with policy making processes, courts are reaching decisions in accordance with existing law and science. For as long as governments fail to take the steps necessary to avert dangerous change, courts can be expected to act as vital checks on political inaction."
"Fossil fuel industries in Australia could be left behind by improvements in renewables and the possibility Donald Trump changes tack on a carbon tax, a former US Republican congressman has warned. In a speech to the National Press Club on Wednesday, Bob Inglis, a conservative advocate for private sector action on climate change, called for the United States to take unilateral action by imposing a carbon tax with an import levy on goods made in countries without a carbon price.  Inglis, a congressman for 12 years who lost Republican preselection over his advocacy of a carbon price, argued that conservatives could be persuaded to join a coalition to fight climate change by appeals to the free market or to faith. Inglis was surprisingly upbeat about the prospect of Trump taking action on climate change. He claimed Trump was “channeling the fears of a fearful people” when he dismissed climate change as a “Chinese hoax” but could not possibly believe that. “There is some chance that President Trump, may respond to his daughter Ivanka’s interest in climate change.  “There is a chance he may listen to secretary of state Rex Tillerson who, as recently as October was advocating for the same revenue neutral carbon tax we are proposing at [eco-right website] republicEN.org.” He predicted reality would force Trump to shift, as gas prices increase, coal mining jobs do not return and new technologies will be needed to create jobs. Inglis favoured a “revenue-neutral, border-adjustable carbon tax”, a plan in which Americans would be compensated for a carbon price with payroll and company tax cuts and the US would levy an import tax on countries without a carbon price. Channeling what he called “Trumpocene” rhetoric, Inglis said the new president could boast of “the art of the deal” and beating China in the World Trade Organisation court if the US “taxed their plastic coming into our Walmarts at the border”. “We don’t need an international agreement ... The way I’d put it is America can make a bold commercial move and the rest of the world will follow because China wants access to the American market,” he said, predicting the whole world would follow suit. Inglis warned that such a move posed a policy risk to Australia, because coal would be in a “very difficult economic position”. He said that technology also posed a risk to fossil fuel industries because improvements in solar power efficiency, battery storage and wind becoming more manageable in the grid would all make renewables a better investment. Inglis said that allowing the free market to operate by removing subsidies on all types of energy and reflecting environmental damage through a carbon price would promote technologies that mitigate climate change. Measures like removing tax credits for renewables would win Tea Party support but wind and solar would still be able to compete if the biggest subsidy – “being able to belch and burn into the trash dump of the sky” – is removed. Inglis recounted how his son had convinced him to take environmental issues seriously and predicted that the Republican Party would be forced by demographics to adopt a climate policy that was less hostile to the science of global warming. “Young people want us to be relevant to their future and they want to know why [we have to] be so retro in the Grumpy Old Party rejecting science,” he said, predicting Republicans would prefer to cast themselves as the “Great Opportunity Party”. The “eco-right’” asks “can free enterprise solve climate change”, he said, rather than framing the issue by asking whether people believe in climate change or not.  But faith is also a tool of persuasion because “there is a deep and rich opportunity there to talk about loving God and loving people and the stewardship of the earth”, he said. Inglis said that in the field of climate change there is no contradiction between religious faith and science and people trust scientists all the time, such as doctors warning them about their cholesterol. Inglis said parliamentarians had to risk their seats over issues like the environment or end their careers in the pitiable position of being able to say only: “I stood for nothing, I accomplished nothing, I just went along with the flow”."
"If you read my articles regularly, you may have noticed multiple times I have stated that the scientific argument is over; there are no longer any reputable scientists that deny the overwhelming human influence in our climate. An open letter published last week by the anti-environmentalists proves my point.  If you read the headlines, it might have seemed impressive: “300 Scientists Tell Trump to Leave UN Climate Agreement.” Wow, 300 scientists. That’s a lot right? Actually, it’s a pitiful list.  First of all, hardly anyone on the list was a climate scientist; many were not even natural scientists. It is almost as though anyone with a college degree (and there are about 21 million enrolled in higher education programs just in the USA) was qualified to sign that letter. Okay but what about the signers of the letter? Surely they are experts in the field? Not so much. It was very difficult to find the list of signers online however I was able to acquire it with some help. See for yourself - Google “300 scientists letter climate change” in the past week. You will see many stories in the press, but try finding the actual letter or the list of names. The version I obtained was dated February 23, 2017 which helps narrow your searching. In an era of Dr. Google, it is unbelievable that the letter itself was not made more available.  Okay but let’s get to the central issue. These 300 scientists must be pretty good at climate science, right? Well let’s just go through the list, alphabetically. Here is a sampling (text copied verbatim from the version of the letter I obtained). Example 1: ADAM, A.I.: (Ph. D.); Retired Geologist/Palynologist/Academic/Public Servant/Industry Professional; publications include papers on palaeoenvironmental studies and a book, New Emperors’ Novel Clothes: Climate Change Analysed.  A retired geologist and a public servant? I performed a google scholar search on “AI Adam” to find out what is picked up as any studies written by someone named “AI Adam.” Nothing. If you can find his book on Amazon, you will see his biography states he’s a retired geologist, got a degree from a university in the UK (discipline not specified), he worked in fossil fuel and mineral industries in Australia and other countries. Oh, and currently he has “wide interests”.  Example 2: ALEXANDER, Ralph B.: (Ph.D., Physics, University of Oxford); Former Associate Professor, Wayne State University, Detroit, author “Global Warming False Alarm” (2012)  Surely it gets better right? I mean this signer was an Associate Professor? Again, not much there. I was able to find this part of a biography on DeSmogBlog: Ralph B. Alexander is a former Associate Professor of Physics at Wayne State University and former President and co-founder of Ion Surface Technology, a small high-tech materials company. He is currently the owner and president of R.B. Alexander & Associates Inc., an independent consulting firm specializing in advanced materials and surface engineering.  No evidence of any expertise in climate science that I could find. Let’s move to Example 3: ALLEN, D. Weston: (MB. BS.); FRACGP Australia Whoa, what does FRACGP stand for? A quick online search revealed that FRACGP is likely Fellow of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. What is the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners you ask? Well if you have more patience than I do, let me know. This may be their website. Once again, no evidence whatsoever of any expertise in climate science. Example 4: ALLISON, Jock: (Ph.D., Animal science, Sydney University, 1970); Previously Research Director, Ministry of Agriculture & Fisheries, New Zealand. Well, someone in animal science may have studied climate change. Perhaps the effect (or lack of effect) of climate change on animals, right? Not likely. I performed an academic search using the name “J. Allison” and I found many papers in high-energy physics, certainly not the same person. So I added the word “Climate” to the search and found - you guessed it - nothing.  Example 5: ANDERSON, Charles R.: (Ph.D. in Physics); Anderson Materials Evaluation, Inc., President & Principal Scientist, Expert in the use of radiation to characterize materials, many publications on materials science, frequent on-line posts on the essential physics of the atmosphere and radiation. President of a company and an online writer - not very impresive climate credentials. You can read his posts at websites like this one. The only Google Scholar hit I found using the name “CR Anderson” and the keyword “climate” was School Climate for Transgender Youth: A Mixed Method Investigation of Student Experiences and School Responses. Interesting reading I assure you, but not quite what I was looking for. Probably a different “CR Anderson.” Example 6: ARMSTRONG, J. Scott: ( Ph.D. MIT); Professor, The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania. My area of expertise involves forecasting methods. I have been involved to preparing and evaluating forecasts relevant to climate change since 2007. This last cosigner I will discuss is a professor at a business school in the United States. As I understand his expertise, it is in business forecasting. What does that have to do with climate forecasting? Not much. Perhaps there is some crossover though? I recall that JS Armstrong was an author on a polar bear forecasting paper a few years ago. How did that turn out? Not very well. It was strongly rebutted for being incorrect in this paper. The following quote from the abstract tells it all (AGS stands for Armstrong, Green and Soon (the authors of the faulty paper): We evaluate the AGS audit and show how AGS are mistaken or misleading on every claim. We provide evidence that general circulation models are useful in forecasting future climate conditions and that corporate and government leaders are relying on these models to do so… We show that the allegations of failure to follow the principles of forecasting espoused by AGS are either incorrect or are based on misconceptions about the Arctic environment, polar bear biology, or statistical and mathematical methods. … In summary, we show that the AGS audit offers no valid criticism of the USGS conclusion that global warming poses a serious threat to the future welfare of polar bears and that it only serves to distract from reasoned public-policy debate. There many are other examples that list no degree, affiliation, or expertise, such as: BEE, Roger: (); BEETHAM, Barry: (); I guess having a first and last name are sufficient to be included in this list of eminent scientists. Sadly, the list also includes William Happer, who is under consideration for the position of President Trump’s science advisor, and also a couple of fellows we know to be quite nutty. Finally, how about the person who appeared to orchestrate this letter, Richard Lindzen? Well, he may be best known for taking contrarian views on climate change that are not substantiated by the research, and being wrong on all of them. In fact, he has put forward multiple studies that were shown to be incorrect or questionable by his colleagues in the field.  A summary that I coauthored of his work is available here with links to all of the relevant studies so people can read for themselves. In fact, one of his studies was rebutted by three separate papers within a year of publication. This is astonishing - most papers are never rebutted. In fact, I would venture that most scientists never have a paper rebutted in their entire career. What is the takeaway message? As I’ve said many times, the science is settled. Human emissions of greenhouse gases are causing the Earth’s climate to change. It’s practically impossible to find a reputable climate scientist who disagrees, or a climate scientist who can support an alternative view. It is also very difficult to find a scientist who thinks that the warming isn’t a problem, or isn’t significantly caused by humans. But, this isn’t a lack of trying on their side.  When the folks denying human influence on climate can only generate the type of signatures attached to this letter, it shows that while they are good at getting press, they are not good at climate science. Of course, press may be all they ever wanted in the first place."

"A little girl sits outside on her front stoop, watching the cars go by and the people trot to work in the early hours of the morning. She wears a long-sleeved shirt, pants, and sneakers. Nothing is particularly shocking about this image, except the fact that it’s December in New York City (or Detroit, or London). In a “traditional” year, this girl would be wearing her winter coat, a hat that covers nearly her entire head, and potentially snow boots. But not in 2016. Or 2015. Or 2014. It’s simply too warm for all those clothes.  If, like many of us, you have the sense that seasons are changing, winters are milder, summers a bit warmer, springs coming earlier, and autumns not quite what they used to be, you’d be right. According to a report released today by the United Nations, 2016 was the warmest year on record, breaking the record previously held by 2015, and before that by 2014. Having three years of record-breaking temperatures is a clear trend that the climate is changing. And the UN isn’t the only one to have noticed; Nasa, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in the US, the UK’s Met Office, the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), Japan’s Meteorological Agency, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and dozens of others have repeatedly stated that the global climate is changing and that society is now in “uncharted territory”. Perhaps having slightly warmer temperatures sounds appealing. I must confess, I enjoyed walking around the streets of Ann Arbor, Michigan, in February, basking in temperatures of 15C (60F). Yet it’s not quite that simple. Changing climate, including increases in temperature and shifting precipitation patterns, lead to real and significant impacts to human health, livelihoods, cultural assets, economies, ecosystems, and society as a whole. For example, shifting rainfall patterns can drastically impact crop timing and yields. Rising sea levels already threaten to further drench coastal communities, roads, homes, and other infrastructure. Shifting disease patterns bring new issues into areas with limited exposure and immunity. Prolonged droughts can lead to famine, as in Somalia and Ethiopia at the moment. And natural disasters, which are on the rise, wreak havoc on local communities and economies. Regardless of where you live or what you do, it is nearly guaranteed that climate change is already affecting you. And these effects are going to get more severe and frequent. In the face of this reality, one would assume that investments in disaster preparedness and climate action were on the rise. If you lived in the United States, however, you’d be grossly mistaken. In fact instead of being serious about protecting the health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens, the Trump administration has decided to gut all programmes related to climate and many related to disaster-preparedness. If you still doubt the need for action to adapt to the consequences of climate change, don’t just listen to me – listen to the US military, world business leaders, or the majority of Americans. Given that climate leadership is unlikely to come from the US federal government under Trump, many are asking, what can I do to prepare for climate change? Here are eight initial actions that individuals, as well as governments, could take immediately to prepare. 1) Make a plan; build a kit. Natural disasters are on the rise and are only projected to occur more frequently and be more intense thanks to climate change. Ensure you are prepared by having a plan for what you and your family will do in the case of a disaster. Then make a kit that has the supplies you’ll need to withstand and recover. 2) Get to know your neighbours. In a disaster, government resources are likely to be strained. Building strong social networks, including within your own neighbourhood, can be an extremely effective way to prepare for, respond to, and recover from disasters. 3) Reduce your carbon footprint. Anything we can do to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will help slow down climate change. The mantra I use is that we must manage the unavoidable through adaptation, but avoid the unmanageable through mitigation. 4) Call your legislators today, and every day. Demand that they preserve and advance domestic and international climate programmes, policies, and funding streams. Don’t take these programmes for granted. 5) Integrate climate change into all policies, programmes, and decision-making processes. We need to ensure that all investments are based on sound science and prepared to endure, regardless of what the future brings. That is why climate change must be factored into all planning and decision-making at local, state, national and international levels. 6) Invest in climate science. Instead of gutting science budgets, increase investments in climate science, including investments in real-time monitoring, research into climate-related impacts, and the implementation of climate solutions. 7) Embrace green infrastructure. Investing in green spaces, parks, urban forestry, rain gardens, and the like would be an economically smart way of managing storm-water and flooding while also investing in our local communities. Encourage your government to consider green infrastructure with the same fervour usually reserved only for traditional physical infrastructure projects. 8) Embrace climate action as a means of advancing economic development and social justice. Climate action needs to be about people. When designed with citizens, climate strategies can enhance both the economy and the wellbeing of all, especially those traditionally left behind. Make sure that the most vulnerable are part of identifying and implementing climate solutions. Regardless of where you stand on the political spectrum, it is essential that we all understand that the climate is changing and it is in our collective interest to immediately begin adapting and mitigating. The stakes are simply too high for inaction."
"If you meet a group of climate scientists, and ask them how much sea levels will rise by say the year 2100, you will get a wide range of answers. But, those with most expertise in sea level rise will tell you perhaps 1 meter (a little over three feet). Then, they will immediately say, “but there is a lot of uncertainty on this estimate.” It doesn’t mean they aren’t certain there will be sea level rise – that is guaranteed as we add more heat in the oceans. Here, uncertainty means it could be a lot more or a little less.  Why are scientists not certain about how much the sea level will rise? Because there are processes that are occurring that have the potential for causing huge sea level rise, but we’re uncertain about how fast they will occur. Specifically, two very large sheets of ice sit atop Greenland and Antarctica. If those sheets melt, sea levels will rise hundreds of feet.   Parts of the ice sheets are melting, but how much will melt and how fast will the melting occur? Are we talking decades? Centuries? Millennia? Scientists really want to know the answer to this question. Not only is it interesting scientifically, but it has huge impacts on coastal planning. One reason the answer to this question is illusive is that melting of ice sheets can occur from above (warm air and sunlight) or from below (warm ocean waters). In many instances, it’s the melting from below that is most significant – but this melting from below is really hard to measure.  With hope we will have a much clearer sense of ice sheet melting and sea level rise because of a new scientific endeavor that is part of a NASA project - Oceans Melting Greenland (OMG). This project has brought together some of the best oceanographers and ice experts in the world. The preliminary results are encouraging and are discussed in two recent publications here and here. In the papers, the authors note that Greenland ice loss has increased substantially in recent decades. It now contributes approximately 1/3 to total sea level rise. The authors want to know whether this contribution will change over time and they recognize that underwater processes may be the most important to study. In fact, they note in their paper: Specifically, our goal is improved understanding of how ocean hydrographic variability around the ice sheet impacts glacial melt rates, thinning and retreat. In plain English, they want to know how water flow around Greenland affects the ice melt. Their experiments are measuring a number of key attributes. First, yearly changes in the temperature of ocean water near Greenland. Second, the yearly changes to the glaciers on Greenland that extend into the ocean waters. Third, they are observing marine topography (the shape of the land underneath the ocean surface).  The sea floor shape is quite complicated, particularly near Greenland. Past glaciers carved deep troughs in the sea floor in some areas, allowing warm salty water to reach huge glaciers that are draining the ice sheet. As lead OMG investigator Josh Willis said: What’s interesting about the waters around Greenland is that they are upside down. Warm, salty water, which is heavy, sits below a layer of cold, fresh water from the Arctic Ocean. That means the warm water is down deep, and glaciers sitting in deep water could be in trouble.  As the warm water attacks marine glaciers (glaciers that extend into the ocean), the ice tends to break and calve, retreating toward land. In some cases, the glaciers retreat until their grounding line coincides with the shore. But in other cases the undulating surface allows warm water to wear the glacier underside for long distances and thereby increase the risk of large calving events.  Oftentimes, when glaciers near the coast break off they uncork other ice that can then more easily flow into the oceans.  One of the ways the scientists are making measurements is through hundreds of probes dropped from airplanes that fly over the region. The probes, called Airborne Expendable Bathythermographs, then fall through the ocean waters collecting data until they hit the ocean floor. They are also using more traditional ship-based observations. So what has been accomplished so far? Well in the year and a half that this mission has been ongoing, they have shown that they are capable of making the required measurements. They have also cataloged how water temperature changes as the water moves along the Greenland coast, and they have discovered that many large glaciers along the northwest and southeast coastline sit in deep water, where they can interact with the oceans. As Willis said: It’s an exciting year for OMG. We get our first look at how the oceans and glaciers are changing from one year to the next. For the next four years, we can look forward anxiously to see whether ice loss trends are benign (we hope) or a worst-case scenario. It’s projects like this one that will help provide us with answers to important climate questions."
"An independent review of the state of Australia’s environment has found the impacts of climate change are increasing and some of the changes could be irreversible. The latest State of the Environment report, a scientific snapshot across nine areas released by the federal government every five years, says climate change is altering the structure and function of natural ecosystems in Australia, and is affecting heritage, economic activity and human wellbeing.  It warns climate change will result in “location specific vulnerabilities” and says the most severe impacts will be felt by people who are socially and economically disadvantaged. Record high water temperatures caused “widespread coral bleaching, habitat destruction and species mortality” in the marine environment between 2011 and 2016, it says. The minister for energy and the environment, Josh Frydenberg, was due to release the report card on Tuesday morning. In a column for Guardian Australia, Frydenberg says the report indicates the impact of changing weather patterns is being felt in the ocean, on the Great Barrier Reef and on land, affecting biodiversity and species habitat. “While carbon emissions per capita have declined from 24.1 tonnes in 2011 to 22.2 tonnes in 2015 and energy efficiency improvements are reducing electricity demand, the report makes clear that, for the world to meet its Paris goals, there is much more to do,” Frydenberg says. The minister says the report makes clear Australia needs to prepare for changes in the environment and “put in place a coordinated, comprehensive, well-resourced, long-term response”. He warns that failure to do so “will have a direct and detrimental impact on our quality of life and leave a legacy to future generations that is inferior to the one we have inherited”. The minister says the report presents the government with a mixed picture. “Good progress has been made in the management of the marine and Antarctic environments, natural and cultural heritage and the built environment – while pressures are building in relation to invasive species, climate change, land use and coastal protection,” he says. Frydenberg says the doubling of Australia’s population in the past 50 years and growing urbanisation “have all combined to contribute to additional pressures on the environment”. Australia’s heavily populated coastal areas are under pressure, as are “growth areas within urban environments, where human pressure is greatest”, the report finds. Grazing and invasive species continue to pose a significant threat to biodiversity. “The main pressures facing the Australian environment today are the same as in 2011: climate change, land use change, habitat fragmentation and degradation, and invasive species,” the report’s summary says. “In addition, the interactions between these and other pressures are resulting in cumulative impacts, amplifying the threats faced by the Australian environment. “Evidence shows that some individual pressures on the environment have decreased since 2011, such as those associated with air quality, poor agricultural practices, commercial fishing, and oil and gas exploration and production in Australia’s marine environment. “During the same time, however, other pressures have increased — for example, those associated with coal mining and the coal-seam gas industry, habitat fragmentation and degradation, invasive species, litter in our coastal and marine environments, and greater traffic volumes in our capital cities.” The report criticises the lack of “an overarching national policy that establishes a clear vision for the protection and sustainable management of Australia’s environment to the year 2050”. It points to poor collaboration, gaps in knowledge, data and monitoring and a lack of follow-though from policy to action. “Providing for a sustainable environment both now and in the future is a national issue requiring leadership and action across all levels of government, business and the community,” it says. “The first step is recognising the importance and value of ecosystem services to our economy and society. “Addressing Australia’s long-term, systemic environmental challenges requires, among other things, the development of a suite of stronger, more comprehensive and cohesive policies focused on protecting and maintaining natural capital, and ongoing improvements to current management arrangements.” Late last year, the government established a review of its Direct Action climate policy. The current policy has been widely criticised by experts as inadequate if Australia is to meet its international emissions reduction targets under the Paris climate change agreement. Shortly after establishing the review, Frydenberg ruled out converting the Direct Action scheme to a form of carbon trading after a brief internal revolt. Many experts argue carbon trading would allow Australia to reduce emissions consistent with Paris commitments at least cost to households and businesses. The Direct Action review still allows for the consideration of the potential role of international carbon credits in meeting Australia’s emissions reduction targets – a practice Tony Abbott comprehensively ruled out as prime minister – and consideration of a post-2030 emissions reduction goal for Australia. The review also requires an examination of international developments in climate change policy, which is code for an assessment of what is happening on global climate action in the event the US pulls out of the Paris climate agreement. The New York Times reported last week that the White House was fiercely divided over Trump’s campaign promise to cancel the Paris agreement. Its report said Trump’s senior strategist Steve Bannon wanted the US to pull out of the Paris agreement but Bannon’s stance was being resisted by the new secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, and the president’s daughter, Ivanka Trump, who are concerned about the diplomatic fallout. The Turnbull government has already indicated that it intends to stay the course with the Paris agreement, and has argued it would take the US four years to withdraw from the deal under the terms of ratification. But if the US withdraws from Paris, internal pressure inside the Coalition will intensify, and the prime minister will face calls from some conservatives to follow suit. In his column for Guardian Australia, Frydenberg says the Coalition is doing good work on the environment and the conservative parties in Australia have been responsible for establishing legislation such as the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, and programs such as the Natural Heritage Trust and the first mandatory Renewable Energy Target. “The task now is to build on this proud Coalition tradition and to use this report to continue the good work the Turnbull government is already doing across so many areas of environmental policy,” he says."

"A mass bleaching event is taking its toll on the Great Barrier Reef for an unprecedented second year in a row, a Queensland government agency has confirmed. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has declared widespread damage from an underwater heatwave after a single day of aerial surveys between Cairns and Townsville on Thursday.  The authority’s David Wachenfeld told the ABC the survey findings “regrettably” gave the agency enough evidence to declare another mass bleaching event, following the worst to date in 2016 which killed off 22% of coral. A repeat of mass bleaching compounds fears for the survival of already-stressed coral, whose recovery since 2016 has been challenged by stubbornly high sea surface temperatures, including through winter. The scale of bleaching will be confirmed through further surveys by the agency and reef scientists but it is likely to take at least six months before the death rate of coral is known.  Wachenfeld said the agency’s survey added to “quite a few reports through our early warning system, the eye on the reef program”. While the more remote northern section of the reef was hardest-hit last year, coral bleaching has been recently documented in areas further south more commonly visited by tourists. Photos and footage taken by marine biologist Brett Monroe Garner at a reef between Port Douglas and Cairns indicate severe bleaching of corals he said were “full of colour and life” little over a month ago. Garner, who has been documenting the bleaching with Greenpeace, said: “I’ve been photographing this area of the reef for several years now and what we’re seeing is unprecedented. “In these photos nearly 100% of the corals are bleaching and who knows how many will recover? Algae is already beginning to overgrow many of the corals. “Just a few months ago, these corals were full of colour and life. Now, everywhere you look is white. The corals aren’t getting the chance to bounce back from last year’s bleaching event. If this is the new normal, we’re in trouble.” The images, released by Greenpeace on Friday, add to what the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration described last month as reports of “scattered coral bleaching along a large stretch” of the reef, from Mackay in the south to the far north. Wachenfeld said the extent of bleaching compared to last year was less important than the fact that “the climate is changing and that is bringing a much greater frequency of extreme weather events to the Great Barrier Reef”. “In total, those extreme weather events and the overall impact of climate change is a major threat to the future of the reef.” WWF oceans campaigner Richard Leck said he was “shocked and saddened by what is unfolding”.  “Scientists warned that without sufficient emissions reductions we could expect annual mass bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef by 2050,” he said. “Consecutive bleaching events have arrived 30 years early.” WWF also released footage on Monday of severely bleached coral at Vlasoff Cay near Cairns, where cinematographer Richard Fitzpatrick filmed sequences for David Attenborough’s Great Barrier Reef series. “Vlasoff Cay used to have the best coral diversity in the area,” Fitzpatrick said. “Now with the water sitting at 32 degrees all the way to the bottom, the corals are dying. Many are already dead and covered in algae.” “The reef is facing an imminent danger of mortality at a level that far exceeds last year over a greater geographical distance.” Pictures of newly bleached coral were taken in recent weeks at Moore Reef, near Cairns, by the reef scientist Tyrone Ridgway, as well as by divers further south near Palm Island. The bleaching has prompted Terry Hughes, a leading reef scientist at James Cook University who is also with the National Coral Bleaching Taskforce, to embark on a week-long aerial survey of the reef from next Wednesday. The survey will replicate one last year that drew global attention to the extent of damage to the natural wonder. He said indications from underwater thermometers were that although sea surface temperatures were lower than this time last year, they had been above average over the last year, including through winter. Bleaching occurs when warm waters prompt coral to expel algae living within their tissues, turning white. The coral may die in the six to 12 months after bleaching, meaning the level of mortality on the reef will not be determined until later in the year. The world heritage-list reef was spared an “in danger” listing by Unesco in 2015 but environmental groups argue it remains on the organisation’s “watch list”. The Australian and Queensland governments, which are obliged to show how they are jointly managing the reef’s long-term conservation, acknowledge climate change is its main threat. The Queensland Labor government, which is focused on improving water quality after its bid to pass tree-clearing laws to curb emissions – a key plank of Australia’s reef conservation plan – failed, has urged its federal counterpart to price carbon. However, the federal environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, at the start of a review of the government’s climate change policies earlier this year, was forced to rule out pricing carbon after a brief internal revolt.  The Greenpeace campaigner Alix Foster Vander Elst said the Australian and Queensland governments should rethink their support of the giant proposed Adani coalmine, given its potential contribution to climate change. “We have on our doorstep the clearest signal that climate change is happening, and that governments aren’t moving fast enough to stop it,” Elst said. “Tackling climate change is the only real solution here and that starts by stopping public funding for climate-killing coal projects.”"

"After the hottest year in recorded history last year, climate change is shifting from a far-off threat to an everyday reality in America. This series, funded with support, in part, from the Skoll Foundation, will look at the impact of the problem and explore the solutions. Content is editorially independent.  At a time when there is anxiety around the direction of political leadership in the US on issues related to climate change, last year in the US there were eight floods considered once-in-every-500 year events. California faces drought, there have been unusually strong storms, and towns in states as diverse as Alaska and Louisiana have relocated due to sea level rise. Clean energy including wind and solar are a huge part of the solution. We will talk to entrepreneurs, policy makers, as well as the communities at risk - the people finding ways to fight back. This series will examine the economics of clean energy - the big picture for policy makers and businesses of different scales - and the opportunities for households to be part of the clean energy revolution, and potentially save money in the process.

"The oil giant Shell issued a stark warning of the catastrophic risks of climate change more than a quarter of century ago in a prescient 1991 film that has been rediscovered.  However, since then the company has invested heavily in highly polluting oil reserves and helped lobby against climate action, leading to accusations that Shell knew the grave risks of global warming but did not act accordingly. Shell’s 28-minute film, called Climate of Concern, was made for public viewing, particularly in schools and universities. It warned of extreme weather, floods, famines and climate refugees as fossil fuel burning warmed the world. The serious warning was “endorsed by a uniquely broad consensus of scientists in their report to the United Nations at the end of 1990”, the film noted. “If the weather machine were to be wound up to such new levels of energy, no country would remain unaffected,” it says. “Global warming is not yet certain, but many think that to wait for final proof would be irresponsible. Action now is seen as the only safe insurance.” A separate 1986 report, marked “confidential” and also seen by the Guardian, notes the large uncertainties in climate science at the time but nonetheless states: “The changes may be the greatest in recorded history.” The predictions in the 1991 film for temperature and sea level rises and their impacts were remarkably accurate, according to scientists, and Shell was one of the first major oil companies to accept the reality and dangers of climate change.  But, despite this early and clear-eyed view of the risks of global warming, Shell invested many billions of dollars in highly polluting tar sand operations and on exploration in the Arctic. It also cited fracking as a “future opportunity” in 2016, despite its own 1998 data showing exploitation of unconventional oil and gas was incompatible with climate goals. The film was obtained by the Correspondent, a Dutch online journalism platform, and shared with the Guardian, and lauds commercial-scale solar and wind power that already existed in 1991. Shell has recently lobbied successfully to undermine European renewable energy targets and is estimated to have spent $22m in 2015 lobbying against climate policies. The company’s investments in low-carbon energy have been minimal compared to its fossil fuel investments. Shell has also been a member of industry lobby groups that have fought climate action, including the so-called Global Climate Coalition until 1998; the far-right American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec) until 2015; and remains a member of the Business Roundtable and the American Petroleum Institute today. Another oil giant, Exxon Mobil, is under investigation by the US Securities and Exchange Commission and state attorney generals for allegedly misleading investors about the risks climate change posed to its business. The company said they are confident they are compliant. In early 2016, a group of congressmen asked the Department of Justice to also “investigate whether Shell’s actions around climate change violated federal law”.  “They knew. Shell told the public the truth about climate change in 1991 and they clearly never got round to telling their own board of directors,” said Tom Burke at the green thinktank E3G, who was a member of Shell’s external review committee from 2012-14 and has also advised BP and the mining giant Rio Tinto. “Shell’s behaviour now is risky for the climate but it is also risky for their shareholders. It is very difficult to explain why they are continuing to explore and develop high-cost reserves.” Bill McKibben, a leading US environmentalist, said: “The fact that Shell understood all this in 1991, and that a quarter-century later it was trying to open up the Arctic to oil-drilling, tells you all you’ll ever need to know about the corporate ethic of the fossil fuel industry. Shell made a big difference in the world – a difference for the worse.” Prof Tom Wigley, the climate scientist who was head of the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia when it helped Shell with the 1991 film, said: “It’s one of the best little films that I have seen on climate change ever. One could show this today and almost all would still be relevant.” He said Shell’s actions since 1991 had “absolutely not” been consistent with the film’s warning. A Shell spokeswoman said: “Our position on climate change is well known; recognising the climate challenge and the role energy has in enabling a decent quality of life. Shell continues to call for effective policy to support lower carbon business and consumer choices and opportunities such as government lead carbon pricing/trading schemes. “Today, Shell applies a $40 per tonne of CO2 internal project screening value to project decision-making and has developed leadership positions in natural gas and sugarcane ethanol; the lowest carbon hydrocarbon and biofuel respectively,” she said. Patricia Espinosa, the UN’s climate change chief, said change by the big oil companies was vital to tackling global warming. “They are a big part of the global economy, so if we do not get them on board, we will not be able to achieve this transformation of the economy we need,” she said.  The investments the oil majors are making in clean energy are, Espinosa said, “very small, the activities in which they are engaging are still small and do not have the impact that we really need.”  Espinosa, who visited Shell’s headquarters in the Hague in December, said: “They are clear that this [climate change] agenda has to do with the future of their company and that business as usual, not doing anything, will lead to crisis and losses in their business.” "
