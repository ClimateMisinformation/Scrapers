"The Victorian Coalition government has the worst record on the environment since the 1960s, according to the state’s four leading environment groups, which will join forces in an unprecedented way to fight what they say is a “wholesale attack on the state’s environmental assets”. Environment Victoria, the Wilderness Society, Friends of the Earth and the Victorian National Parks Association are combining resources to target marginal seats before the 29 November election.  In a statement to be released on Friday, the groups, all founded in the late 1960s or early 1970s, say they have never witnessed such “callous indifference” to the environment. They say the government has made damaging decisions including: “We cannot accept such an attack on our natural assets. We cannot afford such callous indifference, nor can we simply stand by and let it happen again,” the statement says. Matt Ruchel, the executive director of the Victorian National Parks Association, told Guardian Australia: “I’ve not come across a government so openly hostile to conservation. I suspect they consider it some sort of war.” Mark Wakeham, the CEO of the state’s peak group, Environment Victoria, said he was surprised by how aggressively anti-environment the government proved to be after it won the 2010 election, without releasing an environment policy during the campaign. Conservation groups are generally on the left of politics, but Wakeham said that prior to this government, all sides of politics wanted a “good story” to tell on the environment. “This government is totally out of step with where public opinion is at. Not only have they been poor on the environment; they have actively attacked environmental protections. They’re not ‘do nothing’. “The performance has been terrible and there’s a united sense of purpose [among environment groups] that we need to rebuild bipartisan support for good environment policy and action on climate change.” Environment Victoria opened a shopfront in the seat of Frankston in June to campaign in four marginal electorates, will spent $100,000 on advertising, and has encouraged 4,000 people in key areas to “pledge” to vote for the environment. The groups cite opinion polls indicating that 76% of Victorians believe the state government has a responsibility to reduce greenhouse pollution, and not leave it to Canberra, and that only 32% of Liberal voters think the Coalition’s restrictions on wind farms are fair. Lisa Neville, shadow environment and climate change minister, told Guardian Australia that both Liberal and Labor governments “have always taken a step forward since the Bolte government [in the 1950s and 1960s]. But when it comes to the environment this is the first government that has gone backwards. They are the worst government in relation to the environment for decades.” But Wakeham said Labor had been noticeably quiet on its environmental commitments, at least until Thursday when it announced a partial winding back of wind farm restrictions.  “They haven’t released any environment policy for the protection of natural areas, and we don’t know what their approach on climate change will be.” Asked before the groups’ statement was released about the government’s record on the environment, minister Ryan Smith declined to be interviewed. He said in an email that the government was “committed to taking practical action to protect and enhance our environment, which delivered tangible results and best value for money.” It had invested $50m to help adaptation to climate change, released a climate change adaptation plan, and was a strong supporter of renewable energy."

"An international deal to limit carbon emissions has been made much more likely by a climate agreement signed on Wednesday between China and the US, says Sir David King.  The UK foreign secretary’s special representative for climate change said that the landmark deal between the world’s two biggest emitters was “very welcome” in helping UN climate negotiations ahead of a key summit in Paris next year.  “It means we are very likely to get an agreement in Paris in December 2015,” the deadline set by the world’s nations, he said. King said that climate change was civilisation’s biggest diplomatic challenge of all time. “Climate change is a global commons problem,” he told the Guardian in an interview. “It requires all major nations to take action and I can think of no other situation that has put the world in that position.”  “In terms of challenges to civilisation, climate change is the biggest diplomatic challenge of all time,” said King. The statement is even stronger than the controversial one he made as chief scientific advisor to the UK government in 2004, when he warned that global warming was a greater threat than international terrorism.   He said the UK’s tough action to slash emissions at home and the billions it spends on overseas climate aid were “critically important” to creating the trust between nations required to seal a global deal. He also said the ongoing switch to renewable energy could hugely boost the economy of the UK and Europe by retaining the €500bn (£395) that drains out of the bloc every year on imported fossil fuels.    “There is no country doing as much as Britain on climate diplomacy,” he said. The key to that is the UK’s ambitious domestic action and large climate aid budgets, he said. Both have been attacked as pointless by some because UK emissions are tiny in a global context and some aid-receiving nations are developing fast. “Gaining respect and trust is a big part of overcoming barriers in the climate negotiations,” King said. “Saying we are reducing our emissions by 80% by 2050 allows us in negotiations to say – and there’s no doubt I have used this – ‘Mr President, we are doing this. What are you doing?’. This has created some tremendous outcomes.” The UK will spend £3.9bn on climate change action overseas by 2016, via its International Climate Fund. “If our overseas aid was a fraction of what it is now, our position of trust around the world would be massively reduced,” King said. Bilateral talks behind the scenes, particularly like Wednesday’s milestone deal between the US and China, are critical to building a global deal, King said. “It is not so easy in the multilateral [UN] meetings, which turn into a bit of a circus.” King said one critical difference between the situation today and the doomed climate summit in Copenhagen in 2009 is the ability of the US to act.  Then, an international treaty was on the table and would have needed ratification by the US congress, a political impossibility given Republican opposition. But the deal now being discussed is comprised of “nationally determined contributions”. As this is a national – not international – pledge, King says president Barack Obama can sign the global deal without Congress approval. King says China has moved a long way from the reluctant position it took in 2009. “The Chinese are very keen to see international movement on this issue. It is of course driven, at least in part, by pollution.” He pointed out that, on top of Wednesday’s pledge to start reducing its total carbon emissions by 2030, a quarter of China’s economy will be subject to a new cap-and-trade carbon market, with the entire economy expected to be covered by 2016. King said the plummeting cost of renewable energy was the key to cutting emissions and that the EU had done the world a service because its subsidies had created the renewables market that drove the fall in costs. “We will crack this if intermittent renewable energy plus storage is cheaper than fossil fuel power,” he said. “For sunny parts of the world, it’s going to be there by 2020 and for the rest of the world by 2025.” “One of the big advantages of going down this route is making use of indigenous energy sources,” King said, not just because this avoids energy security problems as seen with Russian gas supplies but also because it keeps huge amounts of money within nations. “If the UK moves, as is the plan, our ground transport sector on to the electricity grid by 2050 we will not need to import any oil,” he said. “The saving to the UK will be immense.” King said the same applied to the €500bn the EU spends on imported fossil fuels each year. “I believe that one of the reasons the EU economic recovery is stalling is the big drain in euros for the purchase of oil.” • Sir David King spoke at “The road to Paris” event on Wednesday jointly organised by the French Embassy in London and Imperial College London."
"China’s commitment to stop its emissions rising will require the kind of massive top-down reformation only possible in a one party state, according to analysts. On Wednesday, Chinese president Xi Jinping stood beside his US counterpart Barack Obama to announce an “historic” deal on carbon agreed between the world’s two biggest polluters.  The US announced new emissions targets for 2025 and, for the first time officially, China said it would aim to stop emissions rising by “around 2030”. China also committed to 20% of its energy coming from wind, solar, nuclear and other zero-emission sources by 2030. But the world’s most influential country on future global warming declined to say how high the peak in emissions would be. “We know today when we will see the summit of the mountain, but we don’t know the contour,” says Greenpeace East Asia’s senior climate and energy campaigner, Li Shuo. The scale of change required in China makes all other countries’ seem insignificant. In order to meet its clean energy target, between now and 2030 China will need to add 800-1000GW of clean energy - enough capacity to power the entire US. Tony Abbott’s climate sceptic government may pause to consider that China will add enough zero-emissions capacity every year to power the whole of Australia. Analysts will now look closely at how the government backs up the international commitment in its domestic policy. The Communist party’s 13th five year plan (2016-2020) will define how the country means to achieve these goals.  Milo Sjardin, head of Bloomberg New Energy Finance’s Asia arm, says China’s stable government allows for a level of future certainty that makes massive, systemic transitions manageable and politically relevant - a key difference with the more chaotic US system. “China is very much driven by policy and they do think very long term. Unlike the US they are not bound by 2 year electoral cycles,” he says. Sjardin believes China must now look to put a price on carbon in order to shift power generation from coal to lower emitting gas. The next five year plan could also include some measures to incentivise electric vehicles in major cities. Li said that despite their scale, the goals are achievable, especially with the seal of Xi Jinping. “I do have confidence that they will be able to deliver this target. Xi’s signature on the statement provides some assurance.” In terms of dealing with China’s deeply bureaucratic energy sector, the president’s aegis is vital.  China’s power supply is not dictated by markets as it is in the west, where the grid buys from the power plants that produce the cheapest energy (after subsidies). In China, state administrators dictate to operators how much power they are required to produce. Li says these decisions are governed by vested interests and heavily favour coal and gas. Xi’s influence may be the key to breaking fossil fuels’ grasp on the electricity sector. Many in China expect a cap on coal to be included in the next five year plan. Li says this is the single most important policy measure for reducing carbon emissions. Such a cap will not only help China to bring its emissions to a peak, it will also add impetus to the already massive push for solar and wind energy.  China has already committed to reaching a 15% share of its energy from non-fossil fuel sources by 2020. This won’t be easy, says Li. The number of Chinese driving petrol cars will explode over the next 15 years, creating a significant drag on emissions reductions. The industrial sector is similarly locked into processes that require fossil fuels - for example the use of coal in steelmaking. Sjardin says the majority of gains will need to come from the Chinese power sector. At the moment around two thirds of power is generated by coal.  But Sjardin says a 43% non-fossil fuel share of Chinese electricity generation by 2030 is “achievable”. “The Chinese power sector is going to look very different after the next 15 years than it has done in the past,” he says. To achieve this extraordinary turnaround, China is pouring huge sums of state money into wind and solar. In 2013, China invested US$64bn in renewable energy projects. This is $2bn less that the US invested over the same period. But from almost the same amount of money China installed more than seven times more energy capacity than America. China’s money was overwhelmingly concentrated on delivering products on the ground, whereas the US was focussed on research and the development of intellectual property. In 2013, China installed 12GW of solar outstripping all expectations and smashing records. No country had ever installed more than 8GW in a single year before 2013. By 2020, China aims to have 100GW of solar installed. China’s wind sector is similarly booming with thousands upon thousands of wind turbines to sprout across its high western deserts during the next six years. By 2020, wind capacity is expected to more than double from 75GW to 200GW. Wednesday’s announcement will extend this trajectory. Li believes the solar and wind sectors in China are already straining and meeting the 2020 targets will be “quite challenging”. The cheapest, most effective gains are happening now. Each percentage of power generation added and emissions reduced gets more expensive.  But Sjardin says his modelling indicates that the 2020 and 2030 targets will be achievable, although this depends in large part on China’s economic growth, which is currently slower than in the past decade. A surge in growth would drive demand for energy and send China back to the coal mine. Some observers are sceptical about China’s level of ambition. In the US, the Republicans have rallied around a line that the US committed to a big decrease in emissions but China has simply promised what would have happened anyway. In its World Energy Outlook, also released on Wednesday, the International Energy Agency (IEA) outlined various pathways for China’s emissions.  Felix Preston, a senior research fellow at Chatham House, has analysed these and says China’s new goals represent an increase in ambition but still fall well short of a safe climate future. “The 20% figure is higher than the 18% share in the IEA’s latest ‘new policies’ scenario, which takes account of broad policy commitments and plans that have been announced by countries. In this sense it is another ratcheting up, and builds on the existing target of 15% in 2020. However 20% is some way below the share of 26% in the more climate-secure 450 scenario,” says Preston. The IEA’s “450 scenario”, in which the levels of atmospheric carbon stay within safe limits, China’s non-fossil energy would triple between today and 2030. The 20% target means it will double. Another important aspect of the equation, says Preston, is what happens within the fossil fuel mix. Natural gas, while still a fossil fuel, has significantly lower emissions that coal. Under the IEA’s 450 scenario, gas use in China increases four times on current levels.  Like all Chinese policy, and the world’s future climate, these decisions now rest with China’s Politburo."
"Barack Obama will make a substantial pledge to a fund to help poor countries fight climate change, again putting the US at odds with Australia, which has argued against diplomatic efforts for G20 leaders to promise more contributions to the fund. America plans to pledge at least US$2.5bn (AUS$2.88bn) and as much as US$3bn over the next four years to the Green Climate Fund, according to those briefed by administration officials. The fund aims to help poorer countries cut their emissions and prepare for the impact of climate change, and is seen as critical to securing developing-nation support for a successful deal on reducing emissions at the UN meeting in Paris next year. Tony Abbott had previously insisted Australia would not make any contributions to the fund, although it is understood the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which leads Australia’s negotiating position in international climate talks, has been considering whether Canberra should make a pledge. Sources said no final decision had been made. Asked about the fund before last year’s UN climate meeting in Warsaw, the prime minister said: “We’re not going to be making any contributions to that.” It was reported that at one of its first cabinet meetings the Abbott government decided it would make no contributions to the fund. Abbott disparaged the fund at the time, comparing it to a domestic fund championed by the former Greens leader Bob Brown, which he wants to abolish. He told the Australian newspaper: “One thing the current government will never do is say one thing at home and a different thing abroad. We are committed to dismantling the Bob Brown bank [the Clean Energy Finance Corporation] at home so it would be impossible for us to support a Bob Brown bank on an international scale.” Federal ministers raised strong objections to Australia’s commitment to the Green Climate Fund during the cabinet discussion before Warsaw, a meeting to which Australia controversially declined to send the environment minister, Greg Hunt, or any ministerial representative. Foreign minister Julie Bishop will attend this year’s meeting in Lima later this month. In opposition Bishop raised strong concerns that money from the foreign aid budget was being directed towards the climate change fund. “Climate change funding should not be disguised as foreign aid funding,” she said, accusing the former government of introducing the now-repealed carbon tax to pay for contributions to the fund. “This is a tax to gather revenue to redistribute it around the economy and to buy themselves some brownie points at the United Nations,” she said in 2011. The government also pointedly dissented from support for the fund in a communique from last November’s Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting – a stance backed by Canada. The US’s financial commitment will be unveiled as world leaders gather for the G20 summit in Brisbane. Australia has been fiercely resisting climate change discussions at the summit and does not want it distracting from its desired focus on “economic growth and jobs”. But the government was caught off guard when Obama and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping unveiled climate pledges on the eve of the summit. The pledge to the Green Climate Fund is seen as critical to UN negotiations for a global climate deal. Developing countries have said they cannot sign on to emissions cuts at the Lima meeting without the funds. Analysts said the $2.5bn figure under discussion before the Brisbane summit was just about enough to demonstrate that the US was willing to put up the cash. “I think it’s a good signal for unlocking the negotiations for Paris in 2015,” said Alex Doukas, an international climate policy analyst at the World Resources Institute. Congress will still have to authorise the funds. But some analysts argue that it will be difficult for Republicans to cut out climate finance entirely. The pledge from Obama could also help spur Britain and other countries to pay into a fund that so far has raised just under $3bn, well short of its initial $10bn target. Jake Schmidt, who follows international climate negotiations for the Natural Resources Defence Council, said: “[Obama] is trying to use the G20 as a way to put pressure bilaterally and otherwise for countries to put their targets and their financing on the table.” There were early signs the strategy was paying off. The Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, was expected to announce a pledge of up to $1.5bn to the fund at the Brisbane summit, press reports said. More than $2.8bn had been pledged before the US commitment – including $1bn by France and almost $1bn by Germany. More pledges are expected at a special conference in Berlin on 20 November.  Heather Coleman, a climate analyst at Oxfam, said the US-China deal earlier in the week had helped lay the groundwork for Obama to offer a pledge on climate finance. “Now that we have demonstrated that China is willing to move forward it does make it more palatable for the US to put more money on the table for international climate finance which everyone knows is the essential key to unlocking negotiations. Without finance you just don’t get a global climate deal,” she said."
"Australia has reluctantly conceded that climate change can be included in a single brief paragraph of the G20 leaders’ communique after heavy lobbying by the US and European nations. The government had resisted any discussion of climate at the Brisbane meeting on the grounds that the G20 is primarily an economic forum, but other nations argued leaders’ agreements at meetings like the G20 are crucial to build momentum towards a successful international deal at the United Nations conference on climate change in Paris next year.  The final wording of the leaders’ statement after the meeting is still being finalised but it is believed to simply recommit to addressing climate change through UN processes. The outcome – and Australia’s resistance – have been attacked by the leading climate economist Lord Nicholas Stern, who has written for Guardian Australia that the latest “synthesis” report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) should be “high on the agenda” for the G20 meeting. “The G20 is the most effective forum for the discussion of the growth story of the future, the transition to the low-carbon economy. Yet the local politics of a country of less than 25 million is being allowed to prevent essential strategic discussions of an issue that is of fundamental importance to the prosperity and well-being of the world’s population of 7 billion people,” he writes. Australia has agreed the G20 should discuss climate-related issues as part of its deliberations on energy efficiency, but this also appears to be wrapped up in a general commitment that countries consider taking action in the future on some of a long list of areas where energy efficiency improvements might be made. Australia is understood to be taking the “lead” at the talks on moves for better energy efficiency in building standards – something Australia may achieve with funding from its new $2.5bn Direct Action climate scheme. The US is “leading” on improvements in heavy vehicle emission standards, and other nations on improvements in the efficiency of household appliances and devices like computers and phones. None of the discussions are likely to require G20 nations to commit to anything, but the Australian government has also been considering new undertakings on light vehicle emission standards – especially after domestic car production ceases, when it would not have any impact on Australian manufacturing. Progress on implementing the G20 leaders’ decision in September 2009 to “rationalise and phase out over the medium term inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption” has also been slow. A proposal for countries to voluntarily submit their progress towards this goal for “peer review” has been met with fierce resistance. In a special “message” about the G20 release on Sunday, Tony Abbott also did not mention climate change. “The G20 focus will be on the fundamentals of the economy: trade, infrastructure, tax and banking. Our discussions will include the $1trn worldwide infrastructure gap, reducing tax avoidance by global companies and increasing participation in the workforce. “While a stronger economy won’t solve every problem, it will make almost every problem easier to tackle.” Abbott has previously insisted it is important to keep a clear and narrow focus for the G20 agenda “to ensure that these international meetings don’t cover all subjects and illuminate none”. US president Barack Obama’s international adviser, Caroline Atkinson, has insisted publicly that leaders around the table at the G20 will raise climate change."
"The perpetual winters that follow giant volcanic eruptions could be avoided by shooting greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, according to new scientific research. Deliberately interfering with the climate on a planetary scale, known as geoengineering, has until now been focused on counteracting global warming. One key geoengineering concept is to inject sulphur particles into the stratosphere to block sunlight and cool temperatures. But the likelihood of unexpected worldwide side effects have made geoengineering a very controversial idea.  Major volcanic eruptions naturally pump huge clouds of sulphur particles into the atmosphere and the giant eruption of Mount Tambora in Indonesia in 1815 dimmed the sun for several years around the world, leading to crop failures. Now, for the first time, scientists have analysed the idea of geoengineering to combat eruptions. The work, published in Geophysical Research Letters, uses computer modelling and concludes it could be possible to counteract the climate effects of a Tambora-scale volcanic eruption by deliberately emitting greenhouse gases.  The researchers suggest a specific HFC gas could be used, as it only remains in the atmosphere for a few years, the same timescale as the volcanic sulphur. Also, HFC-152a does not destroy ozone, unlike its chemical cousins. However, Professor Keith Shine, at the University of Reading and one of the research team, said: “We estimate that large quantities would be needed. This would be very expensive, and would require a vastly expanded industrial production capacity. Society would have to decide whether the risks associated with such a large volcanic eruption could ever justify this expense.”  The scientists calculate 1.25bn tonnes of HFC-152a would be needed in the first year. Today, just 150,000 tonnes of the most common related gas, HFC-1234a, are released each year. “Considering such drastic action may appear far-fetched,” said Dr Jan Fuglestvedt, at the Center for International Climate and Environmental Research in Norway, and another member of the research team. “But it would be unwise for the scientific community and policymakers not to think the issue through. Future, large volcanic eruptions are inevitable.”  The study acknowledges “numerous practical, financial, scientific, philosophical and ethical issues.” Other climatologists cautiously welcomed the research. “The possibility of deliberate intervention to ‘engineer’ our climate is undoubtedly scary, but climate change causes problems for both people and ecosystems, especially if it is large and rapid and whether it is warming or cooling,” said Prof John Shepherd, at the University of Southampton. “We need to be prepared, so far as possible, and explorations like this are desirable, even if some people find them distasteful.” Prof Piers Forster, at the University of Leeds, said: “This is a great paper as it changes the perspective on geoengineering and as such reminds us what a ridiculous idea trying some technological fix to counter carbon dioxide could be.” The enormous HFC injection into the atmosphere would keep temperatures from plummeting by trapping heat via the greenhouse effect. “Unfortunately this wouldn’t help with the major impact of large volcanoes on ecosystems which is changes in sunlight,” said Prof Peter Cox at the University of Exeter."
"Victorian premier Denis Napthine has ruled out any shutdown of the state’s highly-polluting brown coal power generators as he set out his election pitch to voters. A landmark report by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), released on Sunday, warned that climate change is set to inflict “severe, widespread and irreversible impacts” on the world’s population unless greenhouse gases are drastically cut.  In order to avoid dangerous levels of warming, the IPCC said fossil fuel use that doesn’t capture emissions should be phased out by the end of the century, while renewable energy such as solar and wind must make up 80% of production by 2050. But Napthine said Victoria must continue to rely upon brown coal, which is far more carbon-intensive than other types of coal, for its power. Around 430bn tonnes of brown coal – a large portion of the world’s total – is located in Victoria, mostly in the Latrobe Valley region. Napthine said that brown coal “provides us cheap, affordable energy for Victorian families and Victorian businesses. It’s vital for the cost of living for families, vital for our competitive industries”. The Victorian premier said the Coalition government was “strongly supportive” of renewable energy opportunities. “We’ve been strongly supportive of the 20% renewable energy target at a federal level and we’ve argued that very, very strongly,” he said. “We’ve offered direct financial support for a range of renewable energy sources whether it be large-scale solar, whether it be geothermal, whether it be wave power or wind power.” Napthine formally triggered Victoria’s election period on Monday by issuing the writs to the state’s governor. The premier said the election would be based around trust, promising an extra 200,000 jobs and 850,000 training places and calling on voters to remember the “waste and mismanagement” of the previous Labor government. The Coalition is currently behind in published polls. Napthine’s sentiments were echoed by Campbell Newman, the Queensland premier, who said that an immediate halt to coal use would condemn people in China and India to poverty. Meanwhile, Greg Hunt, the federal environment minister, said on Monday: “I think any of us who are trying to predict what happens, you know, almost a century away in terms of energy use might be getting a little bit ahead of ourselves. “What does matter is that we take practical progressive steps to be more efficient, to reduce emissions because you can clean up air quality if you’re reducing particulate pollution which is often associated with the sources of CO2 and methane because they’re related product.” Mark Wakeham, chief executive of Environment Victoria, said Napthine’s view of coal was “divorced from the reality of climate science”. “When it comes to climate science, Denis Napthine and Tony Abbott are two peas in a pod,” he told Guardian Australia. “This Victorian government have almost universally favoured fossil fuel generation over renewables.” Wakeham said the Coalition had shelved any plan to phase out Victoria’s three big brown coal generators – Hazelwood, Loy Yang and Yallourn – and placed restrictions on new wind farms and attempted to reverse any progress on energy efficiency. “This is disappointing because in opposition the Coalition supported an emissions trading scheme, supported having an emissions reduction target and supported solar feed-in tariffs,” he said. “They’ve now abolished everything, they’ve removed every plank there was in place on climate change. We need genuine support for renewables and to decarbonise the economy.” The Coalition at both federal and Victorian levels have highlighted the role of new technology in either capturing and burying carbon emitted by brown coal generators, by up to 50% in some cases. But professor Peter Christoff of the University of Melbourne said this approach was problematic. “We’ve heard about new technology and carbon capture for more than a decade and nothing’s happened,” he told Guardian Australia. “It’s too expensive and there are lots of cheaper and cleaner options out there. Brown coal is an energy intensive, high-emissions fuel and just isn’t viable as an energy source in the future.”"

"When the Pacific island of Samoa hosted the United Nations’s third International Conference on Small Island Developing States (Sids) in September 2014, the entire island was decorated with the flags of fellow small islands and with children’s paintings of forests and marine life. Outside shops and homes banners read “welcome” and “there is hope”.  Rarely does an entire nation get behind something as wholeheartedly as the Samoans did. It was a novelty for an island nation of 190,000 to host more than 3,000 people from around the world. But Samoa’s embrace of the event was also indicative of the scale of what is at stake. Climate change threatens to not only undo years of development progress in small islands but to potentially erase whole countries and cultures. Writing in the Guardian this summer, the Prime Minister of Samoa said simply: “we are drowning.”   Sids’ climate change adaptation needs are among the highest in the world when measured as a proportion of national output. As the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) explained recently to the Guardian, the upfront costs of such investments are simply too high for small economies to bear.  And by almost any measure, Sids are the most heavily indebted countries in the world (although there are important differences among countries). In 2013, Sids’ debt to GDP ratios stood at, on average, 64.3% as compared to 34.4% for developing countries as a whole. In the Caribbean, debt ratios are higher still. Public debt levels amounted to, on average, over 80% of GDP in 2013. But with small populations and limited political influence, small islands are not typically high on larger and wealthier countries’ priority lists. Less than 3% of OECD donors’ development aid is allocated to Sids, and their share has steadily declined over recent years. Aid is also heavily concentrated in just a few countries, such as Haiti, the Solomon Islands and Timor-Leste. South-South Cooperation has expanded – China has become an important provider of financial assistance in the Caribbean and the Pacific – but financing gaps are still high.  Sids are also, in many ways, success stories. Barbados and the Seychelles enjoy high per capita incomes and several – including the Bahamas, Fiji, Mauritius, and Trinidad and Tobago – rank highly on the UNDP’s Human Development Index. The flip-side is they are then locked-out of concessional finance (loans extended at below-market rates). Many Sids must rely on private finance to meet fiscal deficits and fund development. Such sources of funds, however, are more expensive, short-term, volatile, and may not expand opportunities for real sustainable development. Many Sids experience increasingly frequent extreme weather events, resulting in serious development setbacks and heavy reconstruction costs. In 2004, Hurricane Ivan caused damage estimated at over 200% of GDP in Grenada, and in the same year, the Indian Ocean tsunami left some parts of the Maldives almost entirely submerged. With climate funds so desperately needed but incredibly complex to access, the conditions for a perfect storm in the form of high public debt are created.  So what can be done? The UNDP works with partners around the world to draw attention to these realities, and to explore constructive solutions.  We believe that for some countries, comprehensive debt relief will be required in order to restore debt sustainability. The details of such a debt relief programme still require further work, but we can draw on valuable lessons learned from the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, which recently expanded debt cancellation to some of the world’s poorest countries. Debt swaps for climate change adaption may also be useful to some Sids, as they attempt to increase spending in invaluable areas such as marine conservation. Of course, debt cancellation should be additional to development aid and not detract from the resources available to other developing countries.  We also believe we need to take another look at the rules on eligibility for concessional finance. We ask whether it is appropriate for countries disproportionately exposed to extreme weather events and climate change to rely on more expensive and volatile sources of funds. Should we not also take countries’ vulnerabilities into consideration? And if so, how? It will also be important to think about how the international community can simplify access to climate finance in the future so that small countries (as well as the poorest) are not overwhelmed. And are there innovative financial products and services which could be useful and made available to Sids? In the run-up to the third UN conference on financing for development which will take place in Addis Ababa in July 2015, we will be working with other partners, such as the OECD, Caricom, the Pacific Island Forum Secretariat and the Commonwealth Secretariat to look at how we can improve the current financing for development architecture for small island economies. We warmly welcome inputs from other stakeholders as we collectively explore all the options on the table. As proud custodians of some of the world’s most precious natural resources, our oceans (and more), the fate of small island developing states concerns us all.

"Lightning will strike far more frequently in a world under climate change – but researchers can still not predict exactly where or when those strikes will occur. New research from the University of California, Berkeley, published on Thursday in the journal Science, found warming conditions would result in 50% more lightning strikes by the end of the century. “For every two lightning strikes you had at the beginning of the century, we will have three at the end of the century,” said David Romps, a researcher at the University of California, Berkeley. Researchers have known for some time that climate change was producing more lightning strikes, and fatalities in developing countries have been rising in recent years. But the latest findings put a number on that rate of increase, using data from federal government scientific agencies.  The scientists found lightning strikes would increase by about 12% for every 1C of warming, resulting in about 50% more strikes by 2100. At this point, however, the scientists are unable to predict where or when those strikes will occur. In the continental US, lightning strikes are especially common in the mid-west and the Tampa Bay area of Florida, so-called lightning alley. “What we don’t know is where those increases will occur in the future,” Romps said. “It could be regions that get a lot of lightning strikes today will get even more in the future, or it could be that parts of the country that get very little lightning could get much in the future. We just don’t know at this point.” The findings provide further evidence that climate change is having far greater effects on weather patterns than initially anticipated. A few dozen people are killed in the US each year because of lightning strikes, with 25 so far this year, according to the National Weather Service. Lightning strikes are also a leading cause of wildfires – and have been responsible in the past for some of the most devastating blazes in the south-west. The deadliest wildfire in 20 years, which killed 19 hotshot firefighters near Yarnell, Arizona, was caused by a lightning strike last year. The researchers used data from federal government agencies to establish the connection between warming temperatures, more energetic storms, and increased lightning strikes, and combined the findings with 11 climate models."

"Barack Obama’s handshake deal with China and $3bn pledge for climate finance could break down the wall between rich and poor countries that has blocked action on global warming for 20 years, observers of the negotiations said. The White House announced the $3bn pledge on Friday, putting climate change firmly on the agenda of the G20 summit in Brisbane and injecting momentum into United Nations talks ahead of a key meeting in Lima this month.  The $3bn is the most pledged by any country to date to the Green Climate Fund, set up to help poor countries fight climate change. The US contribution puts the fund at nearly $6bn towards its initial $10bn goal. Robert Menendez, one of four Democratic Senators who had pressed Obama to stump up for climate finance, said the pledge could unlock UN talks. “The announced $3bn pledge is exactly what’s needed to bring developing countries to the table for a meaningful climate agreement in Paris next year,” the New Jersey Democrat said in a statement. Campaign groups also widely praised the pledge as a sign of Obama’s commitment to his climate change agenda – but a number of groups said America could have done far more. The Catholic foreign mission movement, the Maryknoll Office for Global Concerns, said America should have given five much more. “Although $3bn is a large amount, given the effects of climate change that we already see – and the predicted increase in hurricanes, tropical disease, hunger and migration – we believe that this number falls short of the US moral obligation towards the $15bn necessary to jump-start the fund and the hundreds of billions necessary to meet the actual needs of our neighbours in the developing countries that are most at risk to climate change,” the mission said. Brandon Wu, a policy analyst for ActionAid, said the pledge was a fraction of the support for the energy industry. “The US spends up to $37bn per year on fossil fuel subsidies. We can do better than $2.5bn over four years for a fund designed to help people in poor countries who are already living with the effects of climate change – supporting action that will save lives and build a better future for us all,” he said in a statement. As expected, the Republican leadership in Congress attacked the pledge, and threatened to block funds. “Obama’s pledge to give unelected bureaucrats at the UN $3bn for climate change initiatives is an unfortunate decision to not listen to voters in this most recent election cycle,” Jim Inhofe, an Oklahoma Republican and the likely incoming chair of the Senate environment and public works committee said in a statement. “The president’s climate change agenda has only siphoned precious taxpayer dollars away from the real problems facing the American people,” he added. The president’s paired announcements – a historic deal with China to cut carbon pollution followed 72 hours later by the $3bn pledge for climate finance – brought reassurance this week to campaigners and observers of climate negotiations that Obama would not scrap his climate plan to suit a Republican-controlled Congress. “It shows that the US is willing to lead both in terms of significant emissions reductions and in helping to mobilise finance to deal with this challenge,” said Jake Schmidt, who heads international climate policy for the Natural Resources Defence Council. “Obama is stepping out and saying: ‘this is something I am going to lead on’.” Taiya Smith, an adviser to the Hank Paulson Institute who has worked on US-China climate negotiations, said she was waiting to see Obama’s next steps. “The Obama administration is thinking about his leadership and how Obama will be seen on climate change,” she said. “It doesn’t necessarily mean the US is going to be taking up leadership on climate change. Let’s see if they continue to follow through on this.” For now, however, campaigners said Obama had scored a critical point for the international climate negotiations, which have been grinding along for more than 20 years while greenhouse gas emissions soared. The old divisions between rich and poor countries, the climate polluters of the past and the rising economies now spewing out carbon in their rush to prosperity, were wearing away, they said. “You are seeing, I think, the beginning of signs they are trying to overcome that old firewall that has persisted in negotiations between developed and developing countries as defined in 1992,” said Pete Ogden, a former White House adviser, who now leads the international climate programme at the Centre for American Progress. “Both of these major moments have to do not just with developed countries acting, but developed countries acting in partnership with the developing world, and that is the only way that we will ever solve the problem.” The first blurring of the lines this week came on Wednesday when Obama and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, announced joint action to cut carbon pollution. The Green Climate Fund was also eroding those divisions, with South Korea, Mexico and Indonesia putting up funds along with traditional donor countries like the US, France and Germany. Peru and Costa Rica are also expected to make pledges at a donors conference in Berlin next week. Those commitments could reset the dynamics of the climate negotiations, said Karen Orenstein, a climate analyst for Friends of the Earth.  “Developing countries are already doing a lot to address climate change with their own resources but they can do more if they have international support and the Green Climate Fund is a really key component of that, of enabling poorer countries to do more,” she said. “Climate change is a global problem so having international support to increase the ambition of others is really important to getting to a global solution.”"

"The board of Brisbane Airport Corporation (BAC), which has two directors with interests in fossil fuel companies, says they had no influence on a decision to reject a billboard calling for action on climate change. The airport’s decision did not reflect any value judgement about a message aimed at world leaders arriving for the G20 summit this month, a BAC spokeswoman said, but was driven by a policy not to allow billboards with a political intent.  She said neither the board nor individual directors William Grant and John Allpass had any influence on the decision, which was revealed by Guardian Australia on Sunday. Environmental and development groups unsuccessfully sought to place a billboard that featured a farmer with the words: “Action on climate change is #onmyagenda, please put it on yours.” The groups had agreed to cut the words “Dear G20 leaders” from the original advertisement, a reference to Australia’s resistance to allow climate change on the summit agenda. Grant sits on the boards of coal miner New Hope Corporation – one of the biggest financial backers of conservative groups in recent years – and oil and gas producer Bridgeport Energy. Allpass is the chairman of Envestra, a natural gas pipeline and distribution networks owner taken over this year by a company linked to Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing. The BAC spokeswoman said its policy ruled out advertising, whether by political parties, groups or individuals, that was “focused on a particular policy issue that is the subject of political contention”. “The examples in this particular case were deemed to have political intent as they were targeted at a political audience with the intent of generating response on a specific policy issue,” she said. “There was no value judgement made in relation to the message.” The BAC itself has been involved in political lobbying in recent years, making two declarations of party contributions to Electoral Commission Queensland (ECQ). The spokeswoman said these were not campaign donations and BAC was “intently non-partisan”. In 2012, BAC gave a total of $6,809 to the state Liberal National party (LNP), with its representatives attending the party’s gala dinner, its state budget lunch and paying $4,500 for the LNP’s “corporate observers program” which gives access to senior ministers.  In July 2011, BAC paid $1,500 for representatives to attend a lunch with the then federal treasurer Wayne Swan. Grant is the only one of 12 BAC directors who is listed with the electoral commission as an individual donor to political parties. In October 2011, he gave a $2,000 personal cheque to the campaign of state LNP member Ian Walker, who went on to become the minister for science, information technology, innovation and the arts. The company on whose board Grant sits, New Hope, and its US corporate parent have given $700,000 to the LNP at state and federal level since 2011. The company – which is awaiting a state government decision on the controversial expansion of a mine on Queensland’s Darling Downs – entertained the energy minister, Mark McArdle, and the environment minister, Andrew Powell, in its corporate box at a Wallabies v British Lions rugby game in Brisbane last year.  Grant’s board position with BAC reportedly came under jeopardy in 2008 when Brisbane City Council under the then lord mayor Campbell Newman attempted to have him replaced by the former federal Liberal MP Gary Hardgrave."
"The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, says he will launch an investigation into reports that Britain spied on other governments at two successive global climate summits, snooping on other delegations’ kit, passes and membership lists. A government document released by Edward Snowden showed that an officer from GCHQ, the government’s eavesdropping agency, had been embedded in the official British delegation to the UN climate summit in Copenhagen in 2009 and at Cancun in Mexico.   Speaking to Danish television, Ban said the matter was a UN issue because Copenhagen was a UN conference. “All diplomatic information is inviolable. If there has been any breach … they should be investigated. UN information should be protected in its entire confidentiality,” he said. The presence of a GCHQ spy at UN meetings attended by world leaders including the US president, Barack Obama, and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, is described in the 23-page PowerPoint presentation “Supporting HMG’s (Her Majesty’s Government) Climate Change Ambitions”. Delivered to unnamed UK government officers in 2011, the paper originally published by Dagbladet Information states that the officer reported to “customers” including No 10, the foreign secretary and diplomats, the Department for International Development, the business department, and the Treasury. According to the presentation, it became a “serious intelligence priority” for the British secret intelligence services (SIS) to spy on UN international climate negotiations in 2007. However, the first time a spy was sent to a summit was in 2009 when countries were expected to conclude years of tense negotiations with a dramatic global deal to reduce carbon emissions. The GCHQ operation was said to have been a success, even though the talks are generally considered to have failed.  The PowerPoint slides state that the officer was embedded in the UK delegation of 38 people because this cover would allow access to foreign delegations and to “kit, passes, and delegate lists”. The officer was expected to coordinate with GCHQ in Cheltenham as well as MI5. The role of the officer, according to one slide, was to discover countries’ negotiating positions, report on how far they were prepared to negotiate, find out whether foreign negotiators were receiving instructions from their own governments and to report these back to UK officials to give Britain an upper hand.  But Britain could have been breaking international law in sending a spy because the venue of all UN climate summits is declared to be UN territory for the duration of the negotiations. The disclosures are potentially embarrassing for Ed Miliband, who was energy and climate change secretary and leader of the British delegation at the 2009 Copenhagen summit, and Chris Huhne, who led the delegation in 2011 to Cancun.  The Labour party declined to comment on Monday night on whether Miliband had been aware that the embedded “communications officer” was working with MI5 and GCHQ in Cheltenham to intercept emails and phone calls. “We do not comment on intelligence matters,” a party spokesman said. But Huhne said: “I was aware that we had GCHQ support for our own secure communications, but I don’t know anything about that. I was in no briefing beyond the normal ones we got from our negotiators.”  The document also reveals the security services’ preoccupations. Under the title “new challenges for intelligence”, GCHQ asks whether foreign governments are “planning for instability or mass migrations” caused by water and food scarcity, and whether they are making the link between extreme weather and high commodity prices.  The presentation also asks: “Is the United Nations framework convention on climate change (UNFCCC) still important or is private capital going to low carbon because costs and resource scarcity makes sense?” The disclosures come as the negotiating teams of hundreds of countries meet in Venezuela before next month’s UN climate summit. It follows the leak of other Snowden documents last year which showed how the US National Security Agency (NSA) monitored communications between key countries before and during the Copenhagen conference to give their negotiators advance information about other positions at the meeting. WikiLeaks cables in 2010 showed that the CIA had asked US diplomats to pass on the negotiating positions of key countries at Copenhagen and to report deals between nations. Asad Rehman, international climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “It’s long been a fact that rich governments have bullied and bribed poorer developing countries to get their way in the climate negotiations – we can now add spying to that list. It’s morally and politically bankrupt for the UK government to try and undermine the voices of those most affected by climate change in calling for more action.” A spokesman for the UNFCCC, which hosts the summits, declined to comment.  “This practice is unfortunately expected from developed countries like the United Kingdom. Developed countries have continuously broken trust and failed to live up to their commitments, this shameful practice, in concert with the NSA boys is a spit in the face of the developing world and frontline communities impacted by climate change.”, said Julian Velez, a Mexican delegate to the meeting in Venezuela.

"Hiding behind the sofa definitely isn’t the best course of action, but it might be the first thing that comes to mind when contemplating the latest round of immense and frightening findings from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). It’s important to read carefully though. Its new report also tells us that solutions are available, even affordable – so what is one small human being to do? Here, to get you started, are a few suggestions.  Yes, that’s right, just talk. Over the past few years we’ve talked less and less about this subject, according to the Climate Outreach and Information Network (Coin), and as a result we’re all underestimating the amount of support there is out there for climate change policies. “Most people think that about half the population is opposed to renewables, for example,” says Adam Corner of Coin. “In fact about 70-80% are in favour. If we start having conversations about this we can really build up a bedrock of support for this subject.” (The organisation 10:10 has been running its massively cheering It’s Happening thread with this in mind - have a look.) Just throwing away less food and eating less meat means you can make a significant dent in your carbon footprint. The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations did some sums last year and worked out that if food wastage was a country, it would be the third highest carbon emitter globally after the US and China. You don’t need to give up meat completely, just reduce the amount you eat, or even just try cutting out the steaks. One calorie of steak requires 160 times more land than a calorie of potato, a study showed earlier this year, and meanwhile we are subsidising the whole meat industry to the tune of billions of pounds, as Vicki Hird of Friends of the Earth points out in her Atlas of Meat. A joyful development in global public policy in recent years has been a move away from road-building, towards handing back streets and spaces to pedestrians and cyclists. For example, Auckland – which has the highest ownership of cars per capita in the world and used to be known as the City of Cars – has been implementing a “shared street policy” to encourage pedestrians, which has had an extremely positive public response. In fact this is happening all over the place, and it comes in many forms. In the UK you can join your local Playing Out group to shut down your street for an afternoon so that the children can take over, or you can talk to the charity Sustrans, which helps people travel by foot, bike or public transport, about some amazing local traffic calming initiatives. You can also support cycle campaigns; despite a huge amount of activism on this front recently, cycling in the UK declined last year, but proper infrastructure could quickly change that. Working towards long-term infrastructure change is a positive long-term contribution, and also makes us feel better about the issue in the short-term. These are the new wave of energy-saving bulbs, and they’ve come on a long way from the blue-tinged alien life forms they once were. You can now buy them in a spectrum of colours and they save on average about £40 a year compared with all-halogen bulbs. And this is just the start. A whole-house energy audit may ensue … There are hundreds of useful tips at the Energy Savings Trust. There is something tremendously satisfying about the idea of reclaiming control of our energy from the “big six” energy companies, even if only partially. “It pays so many dividends simultaneously – carbon, environmental, economic and social,” says Ed Gillespie of Futerra. Nick Dearden of the World Development Movement says we should be learning from the success of Germany’s Energiewende programme, which gives “more power to communities and ‘ordinary people’ to control systems of renewable energy production and distribution”. This community model really is working in Germany and here in the UK the Solar Schools project is a great starting point. Studies show that after raising money for solar panels for their local school the majority of people feel closer to their community, and are far more likely to get solar panels themselves. Pop along to WritetoThem.com and drop your MP a line asking what they are doing and saying about climate change. You don’t have to be an expert – just let them know you’re out there. But if you want to go a step further, the Green party leader, Natalie Bennett, suggests asking them whether they support the energy bill revolution, for example, a campaign to step up the greening of our national housing stock. Corner says: “If MPs don’t hear about these subjects from constituents, they don’t know that you care about it.” Telling your MP that this is an issue that you are passionate about, and are following closely, gives them motivation to be more active in Westminster. That’s six ideas, but there are so many other exciting possibilities. What are you currently doing to address climate change – and what do you think is the most important change you can make as an individual?"

"German ambitions to generate the vast majority of its power from the sun, wind and other renewable sources by the middle of the century are at risk from cuts to solar subsidies and weak EU clean energy targets, industry and experts say.  The country’s target of getting 80% of energy from renewable sources by 2050 is one of the few to match the scaling-up of renewable power that the UN’s climate science panel said on Sunday was needed to avoid “severe, widespread, and irreversible impacts” from global warming. The Energiewende (‘Energy transition’) programme to chisel fossil fuels out of Germany’s energy mix has a breathtakingly ambitious air that has swept through the north city-state of Bremen, where even the football stadiums and funfairs run entirely on clean energy. In 2008, shortly after the EU set its green energy targets for 2020, the Freimarkt funfair and Werder Bremen football club both switched to renewable power, with the club completely renovating its stadium in a business deal with energy company EWE.  “Our colours are green and white,” said Klaus Filbry, the managing director of Werder Bremen, which is home to Europe’s first and largest solar-powered football stadium. “The green stands for being environmentally conscious and the white stands for peace. It is important for us. We get a lot of support from the community and we want to give back to them. All the electricity we produce goes into the grid system.” Fans can sign up to buy 1% of their electricity from the stadium, which with a solar capacity of 1.2MW produces enough surplus energy to power 400-500 houses a year. The better the team perform, the lower the electricity tariff, although this is not a selling point for Bremen fans this year. The Weser Stadium is armadillo-plated with 200,000 single module solar cells that resemble a huge postmodern lampshade. Next to it is a solar-powered restaurant.  Not all the Werder Bremen players were initially excited by the green makeover. But Clemens Fritz, the team captain, told the Guardian: “When I heard that the stadium would be transformed into a ‘futuristic spacecraft’ I was delighted that it would not only look fantastic but also generate environmentally friendly energy.”  “The whole facade and roof were built for €11.5m,” according to EWE spokesman and Bremen fan, Christian Bartsche. “Economically, it just breaks even but in marketing terms it has such a positive image that it is a plus for us. The Weser Stadium is like a lighthouse that anyone can see as they fly into Bremen. It lights up the region.” Bremen is not alone. The nearby state of Schleswig-Holstein is close to producing all of its electricity from wind power, and Germany as a whole is aiming for 40% of electricity from renewable sources by 2025. Filbry said he could imagine a club attaching wind turbines to its floodlights. “Like us, it would have a unique visibility and it could work – especially in an area where there’s a lot of wind,” he said But in the solar industry, falling solar panel costs spurred by Chinese mass production have sucked almost half of the jobs out of a sector that employed 100,000 people in 2012. At the same time, cheaper solar has reduced retail prices, spurring consumer uptake but bringing cuts to public support schemes. Filbry said that the removal of tax incentives for solar had already affected all clubs with tie-ins to renewable energy firms: “A lot of those partnerships were finished because of changes to the law and that certainly had a financial effect that was felt in the league. Less money came in. Our sponsorship with one company went down from €500,000 to €200,000. We were able to compensate and find other partners but it did hurt the club financially.”  Filbry admits that the club had less money to spend on players for a time but stoutly denies any link to the club’s current position at the bottom of the Bundesliga. Subsidy cutbacks have been felt across the industry, as the cost of solar power has fallen closer to the cost of fossil fuel energy. From a zenith of $0.90 per kilowatt hour, German feed-in-tariffs that pay people for generating energy from solar have fallen to around $0.20 per kwh today. The guaranteed 20-year tariff offered to early household investors is now a thing of the past. An EU state aid decision this year that solar had reached industrial ‘maturity’ will accelerate the subsidy tail-off in 2015. Anger is widespread in Germany that the EU commissioner responsible for the decision, Joaquín Almunia, allowed nuclear energy in the UK another 30 years of public backing.  “It is completely irrational,” said Milan Nitzschke, the vice president of SolarWorld, one of the world’s largest solar panel manufacturers. The Bonn-based firm failed in a recent attempt to launch an EU anti-dumping case against Chinese manufacturers.  “We don’t have subsidy free markets anywhere in the EU so why is the commission ruling against feed-in-tariffs for renewables in Germany while granting them in the UK for nuclear?” Nitzschke said. “The thinking is completely wrong. It is creating a less efficient system that only benefits major players with huge windfall effects.” The EU’s recent decision to mandate a 27% share for renewables across Europe by 2030 was “only symbolic, nothing more,” he added, as the commission would have no enforcement powers over member states. “But we know there is a need for renewables in every European energy market and solar is the upcoming cheapest energy source. We’re now at a level where we can compete with gas-fired plants when the sun shines, so solar will anyhow become one of the major electricity sources.” Frauke Thies, the energy policy director for the European Photovoltaic Industry Association told the Guardian, said: “Downsizing the EU’s political ambition for renewables now means stopping right before the finish-line. By slowing down the pace of renewables uptake, Europe risks being left behind in the global energy transition.” Last year, renewables provided around 24% of Germany’s electricity, but coal and lignite accounted for 45% - 2% up from 2011, when the country began switching off nuclear power plants in the wake of the Fukushima disaster. The phase-out is expected to complete in 2022, adding to a sense of urgency in the energiewende transition strategy. New innovations, such as an expensive Eqoo solar storage unit that EWE put on the market in April, are to provide somewhere to bank unused solar power. The Eqoo stores solar energy for around six hours but so far just 80 units have been sold.  “You have to inform the public about it and convince them it’s a good idea,” Bartsche said. “You also have to find the first-time buyers, as customers who already have solar panels on their homes are getting enough money for their kilowatt hours.” With home-generated solar electricity around half the price charged by power companies, it makes more sense to use your own sunshine. At the Next Energy research lab in Oldenburg, thin-film solar panels are in development in a variety of colours. The flimsy panels are one micrometre thick – compared to 200-300 micrometres for traditional PV panels – and can be used for windowpanes and house tiles. Dr Thibo Kilper, Next Energy’s research manager says that commercial negotiations are underway and the product could be appearing in new house builds by 2016. But similar problems are holding the next-generation solar sector back. “A lot of partners for publicly-funded projects went bankrupt and disappeared from the market,” Kilper said. “It meant that many months and years of work were for nothing. It is a little frustrating but we have to be creative. We are looking at other European markets.”  The EU’s relatively low 2030 target was “frustrating,” he said, as a dynamic market and clear public interest were not being allowed to grow as fast as possible. “There are strong lobbies from conventional fossil fuels working against us. This is clear,” agreed Dr Wedigo von Wedel, Next Energy’s head of energy storage division. “There needs to be some money and force behind our research to make the energiewende a reality.”  "
"Who in the US decides what gets done – or not – on climate change policy? The influence of industry, the balance of power in Congress and the popular will all play a role. But the climate deal between China and the United States announced on Tuesday seems to underscore the importance of committed leadership as well. “We have to act with more urgency” on climate change, President Barack Obama said in his state of the union address this year. Now he has concrete results to show.  The question presents itself of how Obama’s successor might build on his legacy on the climate – or break it down. It turns out the potential 2016 presidential candidates fall along a spectrum on the issue, from flat denialism to a sense of urgency that rivals the current president’s. Here’s a roundup of where they stand:  Rick Santorum, former senator from Pennsylvania Here’s Santorum running for president last time: To me this is an opportunity for the left to create – it’s really a beautifully concocted scheme because they know that the earth is gonna cool and warm. It’s been on a warming trend so they said, ‘Oh, let’s take advantage of that and say that we need the government to come in and regulate your life some more because it’s getting warmer.’ Marco Rubio, senator from Florida Rubio has taken different routes to denial, from saying he’s not a scientist to second-guessing the data. Here’s what he said in a May interview on ABC News: I don’t agree with the notion that some are putting out there, including scientists, that somehow there are actions we can take today that would actually have an impact on what’s happening in our climate. Our climate is always changing. And what they have chosen to do is take a handful of decades of research and say that this is now evidence of a longer-term trend that’s directly and almost solely attributable to man-made activity. I do not agree with that. I do not believe that human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climate the way these scientists are portraying it. That’s what I do not – and I do not believe that the laws that they propose we pass will do anything about it. Except it will destroy our economy. Ted Cruz, senator from Texas Here’s Cruz in a February 2014 interview with CNN:  The last 15 years, there has been no recorded warming. Contrary to all the theories that – that they are expounding, there should have been warming over the last 15 years. It hasn’t happened. Other parts are going up. It is not – you know, you always have to be worried about something that is considered a so-called scientific theory that fits every scenario. Climate change, as they have defined it, can never be disproved, because whether it gets hotter or whether it gets colder, whatever happens, they’ll say, well, it’s changing, so it proves our theory. I am always troubled by a theory that fits every perfect situation. Paul Ryan, former GOP vice-presidential nominee Ryan restated his view on climate change in an October 2014 debate, in which he was asked if he thought human activity was to blame for changes to the planet’s climate: “I don’t know the answer to that question,” Ryan said. “I don’t think science does, either.” Rick Perry, governor of Texas Perry is a dependable denier of climate change. The Dallas Morning News quoted him on the topic at a June lunch with reporters in Washington: “I don’t believe that we have the settled science by any sense of the imagination to stop that kind of economic opportunity … Calling CO2 a pollutant is doing a disservice the country, and I believe a disservice to the world,” he said. “I’m not a scientist,” he said, but “short term, I’m substantially more concerned about Iran changing the temperature of New York.”  Rand Paul, senator from Kentucky Paul was asked in April 2014 whether he believed “that climate change exists, and that it’s a manmade problem”. He answered: I think that scientific debate should not be dumbed down to politics. I think this debate has become so dumbed down beyond belief. The Earth is 4.54 or 4.6 billion years old. Anybody who’s ever studied any geology knows that over periods of time, long periods of time, that the climate changes, mmkay? I’m not sure anybody exactly knows why. But we have twenty-, thirty-, hundred-thousand sort of year cycles that go on with the climate. It has been much warmer than it is today. We have real data [for] about 100 years. So somebody tell me what 100 years’ data is in an Earth that is 4.6 billion years old? My guess is that the conclusions you make from that are not conclusive. Jeb Bush, former governor of Florida Bush hasn’t spoken out much about climate change lately, as is his prerogative as someone who has not run for office in almost 10 years. But in an interview with Fox Business in 2011 he had this to say: I think global warming may be real. It is not unanimous among scientists that it is disproportionately manmade. What I get a little tired of on the left is this idea that somehow science has decided all this so you can’t have a view. Mike Huckabee, former governor of Arkansas Huckabee addressed the issue in a 2007 presidential debate and ended up talking about the Boy Scouts and God: The most important thing about global warming is this. Whether humans are responsible for the bulk of climate change is going to be left to the scientists, but it’s all of our responsibility to leave this planet in better shape for the future generations than we found it. It’s the old Boy Scout rule of the campsite: you leave the campsite in better shape than you found it. I believe that even our responsibility to God means that we have to be good stewards of this Earth, be good caretakers of the natural resources that don’t belong to us, we just get to use them. We have no right to abuse them. Andrew Cuomo, governor of New York After Superstorm Sandy hit New York in October 2012, Cuomo talked a lot about how the weather was going crazy – but he did not get into why. A November op-ed he wrote for the Daily News is representative: Extreme weather is the new normal. In the past two years, we have had two storms, each with the odds of a 100-year occurrence. Debating why does not lead to solutions – it leads to gridlock. The denial and deliberation from extremists on both sides about the causes of climate change are distracting us from addressing its inarguable effects. Recent events demand that we get serious once and for all. Bobby Jindal, governor of Louisiana Jindal outlined his latest thinking on climate change at a September breakfast for reporters in Washington, DC, reported on by the Los Angeles Times: “Let the scientists decide the underlying facts,” Jindal said at the breakfast, adding that he accepts the idea that human activities are causing some amount of global climate change, but “the real question is how much.” Mitt Romney, 2012 GOP presidential nominee Romney lays out his thinking in his 2010 book, No Apology: The Case for American Greatness: It’s impossible not to take a look at our current energy policies without considering the question of climate change. I believe that climate change is occurring – the reduction in the size of global ice caps is hard to ignore. I also believe that human activity is a contributing factor. I am uncertain how much of the warming, however, is attributable to man and how much is attributable to factors out of our control. I do not support radical feelgood policies like a unilateral US cap-and-trade mandate. Such policies would have little effect on the climate but could cripple economic growth with devastating results for people across the planet … Chris Christie, governor of New Jersey With his eyes on the White House, Christie hasn’t been talking much lately about climate change. But he went on the record in 2011: When you have over 90% of the world’s scientists who have studied this, stating that climate change is occurring and that humans play a contributing role, it’s time to defer to the experts. Hillary Clinton, former secretary of state Clinton’s position on the spectrum is unique. She doesn’t state as bluntly as Biden or Warren, below, that humans are wrecking the planet. But she has done substantial work in government and through the Clinton Climate Initiative to address the problem.  In the National Clean Energy Summit in September 2014, Clinton called climate change “the most consequential, urgent, sweeping collection of challenges we face as a nation and a world”. She added a dig at “deniers”: “The data is unforgiving no matter what the deniers try to assert … Aside from the deniers and the special interests and all the other folks who want to pretend we don’t have a crisis is the fact that we are leaving money and jobs behind. For those on the other side, they have to answer to the reality they are denying people’s jobs and middle class incomes and upward mobility by their refusal to look to the future.” In her 2014 book Hard Choices, Clinton describes a scene at the Copenhagen Climate Summit in 2009 in which she and President Barack Obama chased the Chinese delegation in an effort to strike a deal on climate change.  Some climate activists criticize Clinton for supporting fracking abroad in her time as secretary of state. Her team points out she created a special envoy for climate change, and she launched the Climate and Clean Air Coalition of 37 countries to reduce emissions. Joe Biden, vice-president Biden did not mince words in his October 2008 debate face-off with then Alaska governor Sarah Palin. Moderator Gwen Ifill asked Biden if climate change is caused by humans. He said: Well, I think it is manmade. I think it’s clearly manmade. And, look, this probably explains the biggest fundamental difference between John McCain and Barack Obama and Sarah Palin and Joe Biden – Governor Palin and Joe Biden. If you don’t understand what the cause is, it’s virtually impossible to come up with a solution. We know what the cause is. The cause is manmade. That’s the cause. That’s why the polar ice cap is melting. Elizabeth Warren, senator from Massachusetts When she was running for Senate in 2012, Warren put this in print:  The science is unmistakable: Earth’s climate is changing and human activities are contributing to climate change. Climate change endangers our health and national security, it threatens agricultural production and access to clean water, and it risks floods and droughts.  Scott Walker, governor of Wisconsin Wisconsin Watch, the non-profit investigative journalism project, has ticked off Walker’s actions as governor that have been seen as hostile by environmentalists. He nixed a high-speed train, a biofuels plant, renewable energy and the state Office of energy independence. Wisconsin Watch quotes Walker spokeswoman Jocelyn Webster on his thoughts on climate change: “The governor believes the focus in protecting our natural resources should be science-based and predictable. He believes you can ensure Wisconsin has clean air, clean land and clean water, while still fostering a positive business climate.” Walker is a signatory of the No Climate Tax Pledge, a Koch brothers-backed initiative to “oppose any legislation relating to climate change that includes a net increase in government revenue”."
"Last August, Berlin hosted an international conference on the controversial issue of geoengineering. We ask expert Dr Naomi Vaughan fromthe Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at the University of East Anglia to explain why it’s such a hot potato for climate scientists. What do we mean by geoengineering?  Geoengineering means large-scale interventions in the Earth’s climate system to try to tackle climate change. There are, broadly, two types. The first would try to take some of the greenhouse gases that are causing climate change out of the atmosphere. The second would try to balance out that we have too many greenhouse gases in our atmosphere by reflecting more sunlight back into space. How would we capture CO2? Oceans and land take a lot of carbon out of the atmosphere each year. There are ideas to try to make those processes happen more quickly [for example, by planting more trees]. The other type would be to use chemical engineering to scrub the atmosphere of CO2 – but once you have caught it you need to store it somewhere for a long time. And reflecting the sunlight? The idea that would seem to be able to do a big enough job for us, given the challenge of climate change, is to reflect more sunlight back into space by putting tiny little particles high up into our atmosphere, into the stratosphere. Have there been any experiments carried out? There has been some laboratory-based work on the particle, what size the particle might be, what it might be made of and how it goes about reflecting the sunlight, but most of the work on reflecting sunlight back into space has been done on computer models or desk-based research. There are a couple of startup companies looking at what chemical processes might be the best ones for capturing CO2. [For] storage there are already demonstration projects globally. What are the concerns with geoengineering? The idea of reflecting more sunlight back into space raises a lot of ethical, moral and legal questions. If you do [use particles] you have to keep doing it. If you stop it, or it fails, the climate will bounce back but very quickly – quicker than the climate change that would have occurred. That causes a lot of concerns. You’d be affecting the global climate with an intentional intervention – so who is responsible for that? What if there are side effects? Taking CO2 out of the atmosphere raises [fewer] big ethical questions, but there [is] still a set of questions about what we do with all this CO2 we are going to store … what kind of burden are we placing on future generations? How does it fit in with reducing emissions? Reflecting sunlight back into space is not a replacement for reducing our emissions – it might be something we could do on top of reducing our emissions and adapting to changes. When we are talking about taking CO2 out of the atmosphere it is a lot cheaper not to put it there in the first place."

"Australia needs to tell the world how it will calculate its medium-term greenhouse target for release early next year and should be looking at a 40% reduction by 2025, the Climate Institute think tank says. As revealed by Guardian Australia, US and European Union negotiators have also been unsuccessfully lobbying Australia to back a pledge by G20 leaders that their post-2020 greenhouse emission reduction targets will be unveiled early, to improve the chances of a deal at the United Nations meeting in Paris on global greenhouse reductions after 2020.  But Australia has so far said only that it would “consider its post-2020 target as part of the review … in 2015 on Australia’s international targets and settings”, taking into account what trading partners promise, and has been resisting discussion of climate change at the G20 on the grounds that the meeting should focus on its central economic agenda. The Climate Institute used several methods to calculate a country’s “fair share” of emission reductions to try to contain global warming to 2 degrees Celsius. It found Australia will need to promise to reduce net emissions by at least 40% of 2000 levels by 2025 and 65% to 75% by 2035. And as governments around the world prepare to announce their targets in the first few months of next year, the institute is calling on the Australian government to explain how it will undertake its own calculations and when it will unveil its policy. The government’s “Direct Action” climate policy to reduce emissions with $2.5bn worth of competitive government grants to businesses and organisations is intended to meet the target of cutting Australia’s greenhouse gases by 5% by 2020. The government has not said what longer term target it might adopt, or how it would be reached – except to rule out any form of carbon price or emissions trading. But according to the Climate Institute, Australia has to start making longer term plans.  “For any policy to remain stable and effective it needs to be relevant not just for the next five years, but for the next 50 years,” its deputy director, Erwin Jackson, said. “Failure to deliver a proper plan risks institutionalising investment uncertainty, and a much more rapid – and therefore more disruptive – decarbonisation at a later date. It also completely avoids the physical, investment and international realities of climate change and evolving action to address it.” Europe has already indicated a 2030 target of at least 40% below 1990 levels. China and the US have promised to unveil their pledges early next year. The calculation of a 40% cut by 2030 is at the lower end of the findings of the independent Climate Change Authority, which recommended Australia reduce emissions by 40% to 60% below 2000 levels in 2030. Australia is also resisting a last-ditch push by the US, France and other European countries for G20 leaders to back contributions to the Green Climate Fund, also seen as critical to securing developing-nation support for a successful deal on reducing emissions at the United Nations meeting in Paris. The Green Climate Fund aims to help poorer countries cut their emissions and prepare for the impact of climate change, and the department of foreign affairs is understood to be considering whether Australia should contribute. But the prime minister, Tony Abbott, has previously rejected the fund as a “Bob Brown bank on an international scale”, referring to the former leader of the Australian Greens. Australia pointedly dissented from support for the fund in a communique from last November’s Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting – a stance backed by Canada."

"Climate change was forced to the top of the G20 agenda on Saturday, despite the objections of the host nation Australia, after Barack Obama urged the world to rally behind a new global agreement and the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, called it “the defining issue of our times”. The Australian prime minister, Tony Abbott, had argued climate discussions would distract from the G20’s economic policy focus and should be left to other UN-led meetings.  But in a one-two manoeuvre that caught Australia off guard, Obama upstaged Abbott and made certain it was the talk of the conference anyway. First came the joint US/China post-2020 greenhouse emission reduction targets announced in Beijing on the eve of the summit and then the $3bn Green Climate Fund pledge made in a keynote speech as Abbott was greeting other world leaders across town. “No nation is immune and every nation has a responsibility to do its part,” Obama said. “You will recall at the beginning I said the US and Australia has a lot in common. Well one of the things we have in common is we produce a lot of carbon … which means we’ve got to step up.” He said the targets he announced with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, sent “a powerful message to the world that all countries, whether you are a developed country, a developing country or somewhere in between, you’ve got to be able to overcome old divides, look squarely at the science and reach a strong global climate agreement next year”. “And if China and the US can agree on this then the world can agree on this, we can get this done and it is necessary for us to get it done.” But in the backrooms of the G20, Australia was continuing to resist language in the official communique encouraging countries to make pledges to the Green Climate Fund, prompting environmental and aid groups to warn the host nation was appearing like a “blocker”. Abbott has been highly critical of the fund. When asked about it before last year’s UN climate meeting in Warsaw, he said: “We’re not going to be making any contributions to that.” It was reported that at one of its first cabinet meetings the Abbott government decided it would make no contributions to it. And Australia and Canada pointedly dissented from support for the fund in a communique from last November’s Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting. Abbott was also attacked for focusing on his own domestic agenda as he welcomed the world leaders to a G20 “retreat” on Saturday morning. Instead of focusing on world crises such as stagnating growth, the Ebola epidemic or conflicts, Abbott cited his difficulties in legislating for a new fee for when Australians go to the doctor and a plan to deregulate the higher education sector. Abbott “thanked God” he had stopped the “illegal boats” – carrying asylum seekers – and had successfully repealed the carbon tax, but complained it was proving “massively difficult” to pass his budget cuts. The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, described the address as “weird and graceless”. But in the formal negotiating sessions, world leaders were talking about the things Australia wanted on the agenda: a Brisbane action plan in which G20 nations will promise to implement new policies that have been assessed to have the potential to add 2% to their collective economic growth, and an infrastructure hub to be located in Sydney promote investment. Before the meeting only Australia had committed money to this idea, but officials said the UK, New Zealand, Korea, Singapore and Saudi Arabia had now promised an unspecified amount. Obama also used his address to reassert American military, economic and political influence in the Asia Pacific and the importance of his so-called “pivot” to the region. The president said the US would work “day in, day out, steadily and deliberately” to deepen its military, economic and diplomatic engagement – saying that by the end of the decade most of the US navy and air force would be based in the Pacific because “the United States is and always will be a Pacific power”. Anticipated protests outside the meeting were largely peaceful and resulted in only a handful of arrests. Police outnumbered protesters. The world leaders were treated to an Australian barbecue lunch, cocktail reception and concert by local musicians on Saturday night. Their spouses visited a local koala sanctuary on Saturday afternoon."

"1. So what is the fund? The fund was designed to be the main source of financing to help developing countries cut their own greenhouse gas emissions, or plan for future climate change.  In practical terms, that could mean investments in solar farms, or construction of sea walls against rising seas, or crop research. In addition to the practicalities, the fund has huge symbolic value. Developing countries see the fund as an acknowledgement that the countries that did the least to cause climate change are likely to suffer the worst consequences. That’s reflected in the structure. Unlike other international financial institutions, the board of the GCF is evenly split between representatives of rich and poor countries. With Obama’s pledge, the fund now contains about $6bn. That’s still far short of the $10bn to $15bn target its director hoped to raise by the end of this month. But the strong commitment from the US – and a pledging conference in Berlin next week – are expected to see some more pledges roll in. Not nearly. That’s just the starter capital. Industrialised countries pledged to scale up climate financing to $100bn a year by 2020 Most of those funds are expected to come from the private sector – not governments. No. Unlike other aspects of the United Nations climate negotiations, it was envisaged that developing and industrialised countries alike would pay into the fund. South Korea, Indonesia and Mexico have already contributed. Peru and Costa Rica are also expected to pledge. That’s not clear yet. The fund, though first proposed in 2010, only got fully staffed last month. There has been wrangling over control of projects, and whether the fund or national governments will decide how to spend the money. However, there is agreement that projects are generally supposed to be evenly divided between cutting emissions and reducing climate risks."
"Investment in renewable energy has dropped by 70% as Australia loses green business overseas, a report by the Climate Council has found. “Investment that could be coming to Australia is instead going overseas to countries that are moving to a renewables energy future,” the report’s co-author, Tim Flannery, said.  Flannery said over the past year investment in Australian renewable energy projects had dropped 70%, while China installed more renewable energy capacity than fossil fuels in 2013. The Coalition government is awaiting the results of a second review into the Renewable Energy Target, with the renewables industry blaming uncertainty over its future for the investment drought.  The report, Lagging Behind: Australia and the Global Response to Climate Change, found China had retired 77 gigawatts of coal power stations between 2006 and 2010 and aimed to retire a further 20GW by next year. “The US is also rapidly exploiting the global shift to renewable energy, coming second only to China for installed renewable energy due to a range of state based renewable energy targets, incentives and initiatives,” Flannery said. Renewable energy generation in the US was 12.9% of the total energy mix in 2013, which the report said put the US on track to meet its international commitment to reduce emissions by 17% below 2005 levels by 2020. “The global energy transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy is now well under way,” Flannery said. Australia has come under pressure to cut its carbon emissions deeper after the European Union last week agreed on a new target of 40% by 2030. The agreement, labelled by the EU as a new global standard, also includes a 27% target for renewable energy by 2030. The Coalition government has said it will consider a new post-2020 target in early 2015 before the United Nations conference in Paris where a new commitment will be discussed. The government also come under pressure from Europe, the United Nations, scientists and the environment movement to ensure this weekend’s G20 leaders’ summit in Brisbane makes a clear statement on climate action."
"Barack Obama will make a substantial pledge to a fund to help poor countries fight climate change, only days after his historic carbon pollution deal with China. In a one-two punch, the US plans to pledge a maximum of $3bn over the next four years to help poor countries invest in clean energy and cope with rising seas and extreme weather, according to those briefed by administration officials. The White House told campaign groups and thinktanks that the figure was conditional on other countries making ambitious funding commitments. The American contribution would be capped at 30% of the fund, and the US would stump up the full $3bn only if the fund met its initial $10bn target, the official said. The financial commitment will be unveiled as world leaders gather for the G20 summit in Brisbane, sending a powerful signal of Obama’s determination to act on climate change despite the Republican takeover of Congress in midterm elections. The White House said it was good for US national security – and foreign aid budgets – to give to the Green Climate Fund. “More resilient communities are less likely to descend into instability or conflict in the aftermath of extreme climate events, needing more costly interventions to restore stability and rebuild,” the official said. “Building resilience also helps safeguard our investments in many areas, including food security, health, education and economic growth. In addition, it’s in our interest to help them grow their economies in a way that minimises dangerous carbon pollution.”The official moved to neutralise anticipated Republican objections to the contribution, noting George Bush had also committed funds to climate finance. The Republican party leadership this week denounced the US-China deal as a “charade”, and have threatened to defund Obama’s climate measures. The pledge to the Green Climate Fund was seen as critical to UN negotiations for a global climate deal. Developing countries have said they cannot sign on to emissions cuts at climate talks in Lima later this month without the funds. Analysts said the $2.5bn figure under discussion before the Brisbane summit was just about enough to demonstrate that the US was willing to put up the cash. “I think it’s a good signal for unlocking the negotiations for Paris in 2015,” said Alex Doukas, an international climate policy analyst at the World Resources Institute. Congress will still have to authorise the funds. But some analysts argue that it will be difficult for Republicans to cut out climate finance entirely. The pledge from Obama could also help spur Britain and other countries to pay into a fund that so far has raised just under $3bn, well short of its initial $10bn target. Jake Schmidt, who follows international climate negotiations for the Natural Resources Defence Council, said: “He is trying to use the G20 as a way to put pressure bilaterally and otherwise for countries to put their targets and their financing on the table.” There were early signs the strategy was paying off. The Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, was expected to announce a pledge of up to $1.5bn to the fund at the Brisbane summit, press reports said. The financial commitments from the US and Japan are in strong contrast with Canada’s and Australia’s positions, which have said they will not contribute to the climate fund. Indeed the announcement could again embarrass the G20 host country, Australia, which has been fiercely resisting climate change discussions distracting from its desired focus on “economic growth and jobs”. The Australian government was caught off guard when Obama and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping unveiled climate pledges on the eve of the summit. As revealed by Guardian Australia, Australia has been arguing against behind-the-scenes diplomatic efforts for G20 leaders to promise to make contributions to the fund. The prime minister, Tony Abbott, had previously insisted Australia would not make any contributions to it, although it is understood the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which leads Australia’s negotiating position in international climate talks, has been considering whether Canberra should make a pledge. Sources said no final decision had been made. Asked about the fund before last year’s UN climate meeting in Warsaw, the prime minister said: “We’re not going to be making any contributions to that.” It was reported that at one of its first cabinet meetings the Abbott government decided it would make no contributions to the fund that was described as “socialism masquerading as environmentalism”. Abbott disparaged the fund at the time, comparing it to a domestic fund championed by the former Greens leader Bob Brown, which he wants to abolish. He told the Australian newspaper: “One thing the current government will never do is say one thing at home and a different thing abroad. We are committed to dismantling the Bob Brown bank [the Clean Energy Finance Corporation] at home so it would be impossible for us to support a Bob Brown bank on an international scale.” The government also pointedly dissented from support for the fund in a communique from last November’s Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting – a stance backed by Canada. The Green Climate Fund aims to help poorer countries cut their emissions and prepare for the impact of climate change, and is seen as critical to securing developing-nation support for a successful deal on reducing emissions at the UN meeting in Paris next year. More than $2.8bn had been pledged before the US commitment – including $1bn by France and almost $1bn by Germany. More pledges are expected at a special “pledging” conference in Berlin on 20 November. Britain has said it will make a “strong” contribution at that meeting. Federal ministers raised strong objections to Australia’s commitment to the Green Climate Fund during the cabinet discussion before Warsaw, a meeting to which Australia controversially declined to send the environment minister, Greg Hunt, or any ministerial representative. (Foreign minister Julie Bishop will be attending this year’s meeting in Lima.) In opposition Bishop raised strong concerns that money from the foreign aid budget was being directed towards the climate change fund. “Climate change funding should not be disguised as foreign aid funding,” she said, accusing the former government of introducing the now-repealed carbon tax to pay for contributions to the fund. “This is a tax to gather revenue to redistribute it around the economy and to buy themselves some brownie points at the United Nations,” she said in 2011. A showdown over the Green Climate Fund had been looming for next week, when a pledging conference was scheduled in Berlin. However, it appears that Obama wanted to get out ahead of other countries – and focus the attention of G20 countries more firmly on climate change. “He is seizing the opportunities that come his way to demonstrate to the world that the US is not going to backtrack on the progress he has made for the last five years, and that he is firmly committed to getting a strong deal in Paris,” said Pete Ogden, a former White House adviser who is now the international climate and energy director at the Centre for American Progress. “I think this is certainly about him showing that he is making no apologies for helping to build up an effective domestic climate policy and he is making no apologies for wanting to help lead global efforts to combat climate change. People around the world look at us and see what happened in the mid-terms. If they had any reason for concern that he would be diminished, I think the evidence of the last couple of days is going to put that to rest.” Heather Coleman, a climate analyst at Oxfam, said the US-China deal earlier in the week had helped lay the groundwork for Obama to offer a pledge on climate finance. “Now that we have demonstrated that China is willing to move forward it does make it more palatable for the US to put more money on the table for international climate finance which everyone knows is the essential key to unlocking negotiations. Without finance you just don’t get a global climate deal,” she said. The ballpark figure of $2.5bn to $3bn is not that much higher than the $2bn pledged to climate finance by George Bush in 2008. “Ultimately this is money that will be appropriate by Congress, but the fact is for decades Congress has been investing in multilateral funds that support the efforts of countries to cut emissions and build cleaner economies,” Ogden said.

"Peru, the host for December’s UN climate change summit, stores nearly seven billion metric tons of carbon stocks, mostly in its Amazon rainforest. That’s more than US annual carbon emissions for 2013 which were calculated at 5.38 billion tons, the new research by the Carnegie Institute for Science (CIS) shows. Home to the second-largest area of Amazon rainforest after Brazil, Peru is to date the most accurately carbon-mapped country in history thanks to high-resolution mapping which provides a hectare-by-hectare look at its carbon reserves, it was reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).  The research by CIS’s Greg Asner means Peru now knows precisely how much carbon it is storing in its rainforest and where that carbon is being kept out of the atmosphere, allowing the country to negotiate a fair price for its reserves on the global carbon market. “We found that nearly a billion metric tons of above-ground carbon stocks in Peru are at imminent risk of emission into the atmosphere due to land uses such as fossil fuel oil exploration, cattle ranching, oil palm plantations and gold mining,” Asner told the Guardian.  The good news is there may be up to 30 million hectares of potential new protected forest areas, Asner said, which may be able to store close to three billion metric tons of carbon. The majority of already protected carbon stocks exist only in 10 parks and reserves, and just four of these are fully enforced. “Transitioning partially protected preserves to fully protected ones would help to counterbalance a great deal of the carbon that is expected to be lost due to land use in the near future,” Asner added. Using advanced three-dimensional forest mapping data integrated with satellite imaging data the team was able to create a map of carbon density throughout the 128 million hectare (320 million acre) country at a resolution of one hectare (2.5 acres). “This new map provides the evidence needed to start negotiating in the carbon market on a bigger scale,” said Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, Peru’s environment minister, whose ministry supported the Carnegie Institution in creating the map. “Our government is also studying carbon stocks in the soil, and is doing a forest inventory, and we have a forest investment program. These initiatives will better prepare us to face changes in land use.” Measuring 69 million hectares, Peru’s Amazon covers more than 60% of the country. But deforestation, agriculture and land-use change account for 61% of Peru’s carbon emissions.  Tropical forests convert more carbon from the atmosphere into biomass than any other terrestrial ecosystem on Earth. Currently tropical deforestation and forest degradation account for about 10% of the world’s carbon emissions annually. This new mapping approach is scalable to any tropical country, said researchers."
"The unexpected climate change agreement reached between Barack Obama and Xi Jinping in Beijing transforms the prospects for global agreement at the climate summit in Paris next year. Is it enough to save the world from the consequences of global warming of 4 degrees or more? Probably not. But to have the two biggest polluters in the world reach any agreement is, as the US secretary of state John Kerry pointed out, a good place to start. Until now, China’s leaders, reluctant to constrict economic growth, have refused to set any target for peak carbon emissions. But growth is now slowing, and although the peak year for pollution has been set at 2030, the agreement holds out the promise that it may be reached earlier. Just as important is that the target now has the imprimatur of President Xi Jinping, who saw an opportunity to showcase some cooperation with the US after years of heightened tensions over Chinese regional expansionism. The Chinese leadership is also aware that it has to respond to increasing protests over the appalling air quality – they call it airpocalypse – that now causes illness and hundreds of premature deaths in many Chinese cities.  President Obama’s commitment to fighting climate change has not been in doubt. It is his ability to deliver that is less certain. Republican victories in last week’s mid-term elections leave him isolated but not necessarily powerless to introduce his pledge to cut US emissions to between 26 and 28% below the 2005 level, by 2025. It has already been rejected by the Senate republican leader Mitch McConnell. Anything agreed at the Paris climate change conference next year – which might not include a treaty, but a series of globally agreed national objectives – could be undone by Obama’s successor. But good signals, however symbolic, are too rare to discard. European countries last month agreed to cutting emissions by 40% below the 1990 level, by 2030. For nearly a quarter of a century, China and the US have been the two road blocks to global agreement. There is a long, long way to go. Neither commitment is yet ambitious enough. But at least they have made a start."
"The US-China deal on carbon emissions received a broadly positive response in China in the media and from experts. While the Chinese press mostly carried news stories about the deal and not much analysis in comparison to the western press, it was was welcoming of a deal some described as “historic”.  The Chinese state-run newspaper China Daily carried an editorial describing the goals announced by the US and China as exemplary. It said the China-US joint announcement on climate change was the real highlight of the meeting between Xi Jinping and Barack Obama and the unexpected outcome was “a pleasant surprise.” The newspaper described the Chinese pledges as a huge commitment in a country where “development carries the only hope of freeing hundreds of millions from their daily struggle for subsistence.” The newspaper also praised the US part of the deal calling it “an ambitious goal that entails a shared political will across party lines back home.” The paper added that the China-US deal will help in “persuading reluctant others” at the UN climate negotiations. The news website news.21cn carried a story saying that if China and the US achieve the aims of the deal, it will not only contribute to improve the environment, but also encourage other countries to reduce emissions. Popular news magazine website, Paper.cn, said in an editorial that it is only with the consensus between the US and China that a global climate change deal can be reached. It said that in China the solutions to cope with climate change “closely relate to the systems, policies and market motivations” relating to dealing with pollution and that the speeding up of action on one “will bring motivation to the other.”  While experts were mostly optimistic that China could reach its stated target of capping emissions and increasing its use of energy from zero-emission sources to 20% by 2030, they also outlined the challenges in achieving the target. On the whole experts working in the area of environment and climate change in China welcomed the announcement but some were more enthusiastic of its significance than others. “It is positive for China for the first time to make a commitment on the peaking of carbon emissions. It is very important because the previous commitment was only on carbon intensity,” said Ma Jun, one of China’s most well-known environmentalists and director of the NGO the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs. He said that to achieve the target will be challenging because “China’s energy is very much focused on coal and the economy is very focused on heavy industry which is carbon intensive so restructuring won’t be easy.” “But I think that the momentum generated to solve the local air pollution problem is a push for such a commitment. To deal with local pollution, China has put on the agenda the capping of coal, which has long been a sensitive issue,” he added.  Peggy Liu Chairperson of the Joint US-China Collaboration on Clean Energy, based in Shanghai, was not as enthusiastic about the ‘newness’ of what was being agreed.  “Like many bilateral agreements between the US and China, much of this was repackaged current thinking for a good timely news story,” she said. But Liu said that it is very positive in it’s significance for the UN climate change negotiations and is a “welcome injection of positive energy”. Of China’s part of the agreement she said China didn’t say anything new. “The internal estimates for peaking carbon were always 2030, mainly based on when urbanisation would peak. China has talked about 20% renewables by 2030 for years already.” But she said that internally, the Chinese government is looking at how to increase the renewable figure even higher. Li Shuo, senior climate and energy policy officer with Greenpeace East Asia, said the Chinese commitment is “really significant” and that the task in hand should not be underestimated because it requires China “to build another US energy system based on renewable energy”. He said China “will really need reform of the electricity market and how the grid operates. That’s why the 20% target carries significance.”"
"Both chambers of the US Congress will vote on a bill to approve the controversial Keystone XL pipeline in the coming days, in what could amount to an immediate challenge to Barack Obama’s efforts to reduce global carbon emissions. The decision by Democratic leaders in the Senate to schedule a vote for Tuesday next week on the Keystone legislation was taken after the party’s Louisiana senator, Mary Landrieu, spent Wednesday afternoon engaged in a high-stakes bid to force the vote.  Landrieu, a longtime critic of Obama’s energy policy, is locked in a tight re-election battle against the Republican congressman Bill Cassidy, which will be resolved in a runoff on 6 December, after neither managed to gain the 50% required for an outright victory in the midterms last week. Less than 24 hours after Obama announced a deal with China to limit and reduce carbon emissions, Landrieu took the Senate floor to call for unanimous consent for a vote on her bill to approve the pipeline. In the end, the Senate and the House of Representatives scheduled votes to support Keystone XL, which would transport crude oil from Canada to the Gulf coast in Texas. The House vote, which will almost certainly pass, will take place on Friday. Keystone has been a political hot potato for the Obama administration, which has repeatedly delayed a decision over approval of the pipe. It is not clear whether Obama would give the project his consent. But renewed pressure over the pipeline, which has become a proxy in the political battle over climate change in the US, was the last thing the White House wanted on the day it announced its agreement with China, which previously had only ever pledged to reduce the rapid rate of growth in its emissions. China said on Wednesday it would cap its output by 2030, and also promised to increase its use of energy from zero-emission sources to 20% by 2030. As part of the deal, the US also agreed double the pace of its reductions in emissions, to between 26% and 28% below 2005 levels by 2025. Keystone’s backers argue that its construction will not increase carbon emissions, because if the project is vetoed Canadian oil would instead be transported to China. However, liberal Democrats and environmental campaigners have made Keystone a litmus test of the president’s commitment to tackling climate change. Landrieu, renowned as a political survivor, spent Wednesday afternoon walking on and off the Senate floor, rallying support for the legislation, which she co-authored with North Dakota’s Republican senator, John Hoeven. She repeatedly argued that the midterm results, in which Democrats were mostly defeated in key races and Republicans regained control of the Senate, were evidence that voters wanted bipartisan action.  Republicans do not take control of the Senate until January, and it had been widely expected that a vote on Keystone wait until then. But Landrieu said she wanted the issued decided immediately. “The public has clearly spoken,” she said in one of several impassioned speeches. “The bill needs to be approved today. Not in January, not in February, not in March.” She was supported on the floor by three red-state Democrats who have long opposed Obama’s climate-change policy: Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Jon Tester of Montana and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota. All of them argued the message from the midterms was that voters wanted bipartisan action on issues such as Keystone. Landrieu, the current chair of the Senate energy committee, made her support for the energy sector a centrepiece of her re-election campaign. Her failure to get a vote on Keystone has been used by Cassidy in campaigns ads as evidence that her claimed influence in Washington was overstated. Yet on Wednesday Landrieu’s political drive was not in doubt. Shortly after 5pm, and minutes before taking the Senate floor for the fourth time to make the formal request for the Keystone vote, she told reporters that her aim was to create jobs in her home state in Louisiana. “This is not about credit,” she said. “It is not about glory. It is not about politics.”  A short while later, aides to both party leaders confirmed they had agreed to schedule a vote on Tuesday. By then, Republicans had responded by tabling a vote on a parallel version of the bill, which will be held on Thursday.  The House version of the bill is co-sponsored by Cassidy, a move that would enable him to tell voters he was also responsible for any congressional approval. Both Louisiana politicians are essentially locked in a race to claim credit for the legislation passing in their respective chambers, the result of which could be a bill approving the pipeline landing on Obama’s desk within a week.  Landrieu conceded she did not have a commitment of support from Obama, whose consent is required for the pipeline to be built. “I do not know,” she replied when asked if Obama would approve the legislation. “I do not have a commitment.” She also faces an uphill battle to persuade enough Democrats to back her bill. Senate rules mean she will need to secure 60 votes to win passage of the bill. “I think we got the 60 votes,” she told reporters. Even if the vote passes in both the House and Senate, the procedure for approving Keystone is currently subject to a Start Department review which has been delayed by litigation over a portion of the pipeline in Nebraska. The White House shows no appetite for expediting that process. “The view of the administration is that that process should continue and that that’s the proper venue for determining whether the project should move forward,” Obama’s press secretary, Josh Earnest, told reporters travelling with the president in Burma. “There has been other legislative proposals that have been floated to try to influence the outcome of this decision about the construction of the pipeline. The administration, as you know, has taken a dim view of these kinds of legislative proposals in the past.”"
"Australia is resisting a last-ditch push by the US, France and other European countries for G20 leaders at next week’s meeting in Brisbane to back contributions to the Green Climate Fund. The prime minister has previously rejected the fund as a “Bob Brown bank on an international scale” – referring to the former leader of the Australian Greens.  The Green Climate Fund aims to help poorer countries cut their emissions and prepare for the impact of climate change, and is seen as critical to securing developing-nation support for a successful deal on reducing emissions at the United Nations meeting in Paris next year. The US and European Union nations are also lobbying for G20 leaders to promise that post-2020 greenhouse emission reduction targets will be unveiled early, to improve the chances of a deal in Paris, but Australia is also understood to be resisting this. As reported by Guardian Australia, Australia has reluctantly conceded the final G20 communique should include climate change as a single paragraph, acknowledging that it should be addressed by UN processes. Australia’s original position was that the meeting should focus solely on “economic issues”. The text that has so far made it through the G20’s closed-door, consensus-driven process is very general, and reads as follows: “We support strong and effective action to address climate change, consistent with sustainable economic growth and certainty for business and investment. We reaffirm our resolve to adopt a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change that is applicable to all parties at the 21st Conference of the Parties in Paris in 2015.” Australia had previously insisted the G20 should discuss climate-related issues only as part of its deliberations on energy efficiency, but the energy efficiency action plan to be agreed at the meeting, revealed by Guardian Australia, does not require G20 leaders to commit to any actual action. Instead it asks them to “consider” making promises next year to reduce the energy used by smartphones and computers and to develop tougher standards for car emissions. But as the negotiations on the G20 communique reach their final stages, European nations and the US continue to argue strongly that leaders should back the need for contributions to the Green Climate Fund. More than $2.8bn has been pledged to the fund so far – including $1bn by France and almost $1bn by Germany. More pledges are expected at a special conference in Berlin on 20 November. The UK has said it will make a “strong” contribution at that meeting.  It is understood the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which leads Australia’s negotiating position, is considering whether Australia should make a pledge. Asked about the fund before last year’s UN meeting, the prime minister said “we’re not going to be making any contributions to that”. It was reported that at one of its first cabinet meetings the Abbott government decided it would make no contributions to a fund that was described as “socialism masquerading as environmentalism”. The government also pointedly dissented from support for the fund in a communique from last November’s Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting – a stance backed by Canada. Abbott told the Australian newspaper at the time; “One thing the current government will never do is say one thing at home and a different thing abroad. We are committed to dismantling the Bob Brown bank [the Clean Energy Finance Corporation] at home so it would be impossible for us to support a Bob Brown bank on an international scale.”"

"A secretly negotiated agreement between the US and China to lower greenhouse-gas output faced a wall of opposition on Wednesday from Republicans in Washington, who threatened to use their control of both houses of Congress to thwart the plan. Under the deal, unveiled unexpectedly in Beijing early on Wednesday, China committed for the first time to cap its output of carbon pollution by 2030. Beijing also promised to increase its use of zero-emission energy sources, such as wind and solar power, to 20% by 2030.  The United States agreed to double the pace of the cuts in its emissions, reducing them to between 26% and 28% below 2005 levels by 2025. The deal struck between President Barack Obama and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, provides an important boost to efforts to reach a global deal to fight climate change at a United Nations meeting in Paris next year. The accord also removes the Republicans’ main rationale for blocking Obama’s efforts to cut carbon pollution – the claim that China is unwilling to undertake similar cuts. But Republicans in the US Congress reacted strongly against the deal on Wednesday. The party already held a majority in the House of Representatives, and the midterm elections last week also delivered them control of the Senate, where the Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, said Obama would not be in the White House long enough to see the plan through. “This unrealistic plan, that the president would dump on his successor, would ensure higher utility rates and far fewer jobs,” he said. In his first meeting with the incoming Republican majority, McConnell, who represents the coal state of Kentucky, said he was “distressed” at the deal, adding that the diplomatic breakthrough would have no effect on his disdain for international climate negotiations. “As I read the agreement it requires the Chinese to do nothing at all for 16 years while these carbon emissions regulations are creating havoc in my state and around the country,” he said. The Republican speaker of the House, John Boehner, also attacked the deal, and suggested he would move legislation to further limit Obama’s ability to deliver the carbon pollution cuts he promised. The White House has said the US can deliver the promised reductions in greenhouse gas emissions through existing regulations, including the Environmental Protection Agency’s new rules for power plants, which are the core of Obama’s climate agenda. But Boehner said: “Republicans have consistently passed legislation to rein in the EPA and stop these harmful policies from taking effect, and we will continue to make this a priority in the new Congress.”  Jim Inhofe, the Oklahoma Republican and climate denier who is poised to take over the Senate environment and public works committee in January, said China’s end of the bargain was just a ploy to buy time. “It’s hollow and not believable for China to claim it will shift 20% of its energy to non-fossil fuels by 2030 and a promise to peak its carbon emissions only allows the world’s largest economy to buy time,” he said. “As we enter a new Congress I will do everything in my power to rein in and shed light on the EPA’s unchecked regulations.” President Obama hailed the deal at a joint press conference with his Chinese counterpart at the Great Hall of the People. “As the world’s largest economies and greatest emitters of greenhouse gases we have special responsibility to lead the global effort against climate change,” he said. “I am proud we can announce a historic agreement. I commend President Xi, his team and the Chinese government for the commitment they are making to slow, peak and then reverse China’s carbon emissions.” President Xi said: “We agreed to make sure international climate change negotiations will reach agreement as scheduled at the Paris conference in 2015 and agreed to deepen practical cooperation on clean energy, environmental protection and other areas.” The early opposition in Washington raised questions about whether the US and China will be able to deliver on their respective commitments. Obama administration officials argue the new US target is achievable under existing laws.  But with Republicans in control of Congress, there is virtually no prospect of new climate legislation, and there could be delays that would weaken regulations put in place by the EPA before they come into force. “The US target looks like it’s going to be really tough to meet without new laws,” Michael Levi, an energy and environment fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, wrote in a blog post. “The EPA power plant rules as they’re currently proposed are already spurring plenty of pushback; pressing them further will be a tall political and technical task. In particular, it’s near-impossible to imagine achieving these goals simply with actions taken during the Obama administration. President Obama’s administration may have developed and negotiated these numbers, but his successor will determine whether they’re achieved.” China also faces technical challenges to reaching its targets. The White House said in a statement that China could reach peak emissions even earlier than 2030 “based on its broad economic reform programme, plans to address air pollution and implementation of President Xi’s call for an energy revolution”. But the White House acknowledged it would be more difficult for China to scale up to 20% energy from zero-emission sources by 2030. “It will require China to deploy an additional 800-1,000 gigawatts of nuclear, wind, solar and other zero-emission generation capacity by 2030 – more than all the coal-fired power plants that exist in China today and close to total current electricity generation capacity in the United States,” the White House said. Some campaign groups also pointed out that the agreement – while ambitious – still did not go as far as scientists say is needed to limit dangerous warming. The European Union has already endorsed a binding 40% greenhouse gas emissions reduction target by 2030. Diplomats said they hoped that the US-China deal would provide momentum to climate negotiations. Officials are to meet in Lima at the end of the month to begin the last phase of negotiations for a global deal to cut emissions in Paris. As part of those talks, countries will also be preparing to put forward their own targets for cutting emissions by early 2015. Herman Van Rompuy, the president of the European Council, and Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission president, urged other countries to show their hand on emissions cuts: “We welcome the announcement today by the presidents of the United States and China on their respective post-2020 actions on climate change. “The announcements to date cover around half of the global emissions. We urge others, especially the G20 members, to announce their targets in the first half of 2015 and transparently. Only then we can assess together if our collective efforts will allow us to fulfil the goal of keeping global temperature increases well below 2C.” Tao Wang, climate scholar at the Tsinghua-Carnegie Center for Global Policy in Beijing, said: “It is a very good sign for both countries and injects strong momentum [into negotiations] but the targets are not ambitious enough and there is room for both countries to negotiate an improvement. “That figure isn’t high because China aims to reach about 15% by 2020, so it is only a five percentage point increase in 10 years, and given the huge growth in renewables it should be higher.” Andrew Steer, president of the World Resources Institute, which promotes sustainable resource management, said the announcements would “inject a jolt of momentum in the lead-up to a global climate agreement in Paris”. “It’s a new day to have the leaders of the US and China stand shoulder to shoulder and make significant commitments to curb their country’s emissions,” he said."
"The climate deal announced on Wednesday between the world’s two biggest carbon polluters was struck after a personal letter from Barack Obama, and nine months of intensive diplomacy. But American and Chinese officials had been in search of an agreement – through official meetings and back-channel negotiations – since the days when George Bush was president. The plan unveiled in Beijing by Obama and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, commits the two countries to ambitious cuts to greenhouse gas emissions after 2020, and could spur other big polluters to similar efforts.  After years of mistrust, the deal began to coalesce last spring after Obama sent a personal letter to Xi suggesting the two countries start to move in tandem to cut carbon pollution, the White House said. The immediate inspiration for the letter arose from a visit to Beijing by John Kerry, the US secretary of state. Kerry, who had a strong environmental record when he was a senator, raised climate change to a top priority after taking over at State. He floated the idea of setting joint targets in his meetings with Chinese officials, a senior administration official said. “The idea was first hatched in a bilateral visit that Secretary Kerry had in early February, where he broached it with the Chinese,” the official said. “And when the Chinese side seemed potentially receptive, we followed up with that letter from President Obama to President Xi.” What came next was a flurry of diplomatic meetings – including a pivotal encounter on the sidelines of the United Nations climate summit in September between Obama and the Chinese vice-premier Zhang Gaoli, who has charge of climate and energy. At the time, there was speculation that China would use the spotlight of the UN summit to announce a date for peaking emissions. That did not materialise. The timing was too close to the midterm elections and China was adamant about making the historic announcement from home turf, those who have followed the talks closely said. But the White House said Zhang did tell Obama during a meeting that China wanted to move ahead quickly on a separate climate deal. “The message from Vice-Premier Zhang Gaoli was that President Xi was interested in taking the president’s offer up and moving forward with this announcement when we were in Beijing,” the official said. A number of US officials were dispatched to Beijing, including the senior White House adviser on climate policy, John Podesta, and the State Department climate change envoy, Todd Stern, the White House said. By early November, officials were parsing the language of an eventual announcement – a process that evidently went down to the wire, in the official’s account. “We were here the week before last and had intensive discussions about what our respective targets would look like, and then finally were able to negotiate a text which was finalised late yesterday.” By the time it reached that crunch point, however, US and Chinese officials had spent the better part of two years trying to overcome their mutual suspicion – and nearly a decade in on-off negotiations for a two-way climate deal. After the disaster of the Copenhagen climate summit in 2009, when Obama was on the receiving end of a pointed diplomatic snub from Chinese officials, the two countries began to put in the hard work needed to repair the relationship. As those familiar with United Nations climate negotiations recognised, there was no other way. China and America between them are responsible for 42% of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the US EIA’s 2012 data. Unless they were serious about cutting carbon pollution, there was no hope of fighting climate change. The primacy of the US-Chinese relationship was familiar to a number of highly placed officials in the Obama administration. Beginning in late 2007, when George Bush was president, a group of leading Republicans and Democrats led two secretive missions to China to try to secure a bilateral climate agreement. The initiative included John Holdren, now the White House science adviser, and culminated in a meeting at a luxury hotel at the Great Wall of China in July 2008. It also produced a draft agreement in March 2009, two months after Obama took office, but it was never signed. Obama’s hopes of passing a climate law died in Congress. After his re-election, however, Obama recommitted to fighting climate change, and again took up pursuit of the China deal. “At the beginning of the second term the president recognised that he had to both take domestic action to have credibility but also to begin bilateral negotiations with China to actually bend down the global emissions curve,” said Paul Bledsoe, a climate change official under Bill Clinton. “From the moment of his re-election, this process began. This is essentially the culmination of two years of effort, recognising that until Chinese emissions begin to decline, global emissions cannot decline. That is just the reality of the problem.” On the diplomatic track, US and Chinese officials were signing agreements to work together on developing technologies for the smart grid, cleaner vehicles and energy-saving buildings. The trust-building exercises paid off. In June 2013 Obama and Xi reached an agreement to phase out the super-pollutant HFCs – an extremely potent greenhouse gas used in air conditioners and refrigerators. Industrialised countries adopted the agreement a few months later. Obama, meanwhile, began assembling evidence that he was serious about cutting greenhouse gas emissions at home – and not just demanding such actions from other countries. Shortly after the HFC deal, Obama unveiled his signature plan to cut carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, the single biggest source of carbon pollution. China also began to put its own house in order, spurred in part by deadly air pollution levels from coal-fired power plants. In 2011, the Chinese government for the first time set targets for a less polluting course of growth, and began rolling out new solar and wind plants. Seven regions introduced carbon trading schemes. By the beginning of this year, all the pieces were beginning to fall into place. It had been, in Bledsoe’s view, the work of a decade. “Todd [Stern] and Podesta and Holdren were all working on these issues in the late 1990s,” he said. “Until about two or three years ago there was still a broader focus on the UN negotiations rather than the bilateral relationship with China as the sine qua non of climate protection. That is what changed after the re-election: the recognition that this was essentially the only game in town.”"

"In the corporatised and coal-company sponsored cocoon of a pre-G20 talkfest in Brisbane, the burst of vocal protest came like a sudden jolt of the reality of life outside. “Peabody – we don’t want your coal,” came the loud but brief interlude from seven young climate change campaigners who rose to their feet to shout down Glenn Kellow, the chief operating officer of Peabody Energy, the world’s biggest privately owned coal company. The chants bounced around the ornate auditorium of Brisbane city hall for only 30 seconds or so, before the group joined hands and walked out into the scorching Brisbane sun.  Peabody Energy, the world’s biggest privately-owned coal company, was the sole sponsor of the Global Café energy event, plugged by organisers Brisbane Marketing as a chance to explore the challenges of powering the economies of the world. Kellow, based in St Louis but originally from Australia, was in the middle of yet another pitch from the coal industry arguing their product is the “cheapest” and best way to get electricity to the 1.2 billion people in the world who currently don’t have it. He avoided the phrase “climate change”. As I’ve written before, coal’s concern for the world’s poor is either a sudden onset of benevolence or a cynical ploy to use people’s genuine concern over poverty to sell more of their product. Outside the entrance to the city hall, others from the Australian Youth Climate Coalition were handing out an open letter, co-signed by youth climate groups from 30 different countries. The letter reads: We are compelled to write this letter because we believe that the coal lobby, led by Peabody Energy (the largest coal company in the world), is trying to unduly influence the outcome of the G20 Summit. Their agenda represents a threat to young people and future generations, and we urge you to listen to our message over that of vested interests. They claim that their industry will benefit the world’s poor. But we know that the rapid expansion of the industry will cost those living under the poverty line their health and clean air - and they are also the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The AYCC produced a video mocking some of the claims made by Peabody Energy, coal industry figures and Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott. When The Guardian’s Suzanne Goldenberg visited Peabody Energy’s North Antelope Rochelle mine in Wyoming, the world’s biggest coal mine, getting the company to talk about climate change seemed to be an exercise in getting blood from a black lump of fossil fuel. When Goldenberg eventually did extract a statement from the company’s corporate communications boss Viv Svec, she was told the company regarded climate change as a “modelled crisis” and that there was “still far more understanding that is required” to justify any concerns over the impacts of carbon dioxide emissions. Svec said: “Climate concerns are a threat, to the extent that they lead to policies that hurt people”. The company’s latest Annual Report is just as dismissive of the position held by every major science academy in the world, that CO2 is causing climate change and that this is a problem. The report describes the impacts of coal combustion on climate change as being only “perceived”. The report says: Concerns about the environmental impacts of coal combustion, including perceived impacts on global climate issues, are resulting in increased regulation of coal combustion in many jurisdictions and unfavorable lending policies by government-backed lending institutions and development banks toward the financing of new overseas coal-fueled power plants, and interest in further such regulation and policies, which could significantly affect demand for our products. That’s a long-winded way of saying firms like Peabody Energy are seeing some writing on the wall for their industry while at the same time dismissing the entire field of climate-related science and its related disciplines as mere “perceptions” rather than reality. Danish political scientist Dr Bjorn Lomborg, of the US based Copenhagen Consensus Center think tank, was also on Peabody Energy’s bill at the Brisbane event (curiously neither Brisbane Marketing, Peabody Energy or the think tank itself have been willing to disclose who asked Dr Lomborg to attend). Lomborg also advocates that the world’s poor need “cheap” fossil fuels and thinks that the world has many more important problems to face than climate change. It is no secret that the cost of renewable energy technologies has been dropping like several sacks of stones. John Connor, CEO of The Climate Institute who spoke in opposition to Lomborg, remarked that he was the “token carbon offset” in a line up of speakers dominated by fossil fuel industry figures. He told the audience that analysts were already predicting that large scale solar power would be “cheaper than coal in China and India within the next five to ten years” and that wind energy was already “at parity with new coal in India”. In a later press conference, I asked Lomborg if there was a risk that by pushing fossil fuel power stations that last up to 40 years onto developing countries you effectively lock-in the world’s poor to expensive electricity (even before you factor in the costs of the impacts of climate change or health problems that come from burning the coal). Lomborg said: Right now the [International Energy Agency] estimate that even by 2040 sub-Saharan Africa will get somewhere between two and four per cent of its energy from renewables… sorry from new green energy. They will unfortunately get about 30 to 35 per cent from wood and dung which they definitely shouldn’t be getting. It seems a good bet that if you want to help the world’s poor you should get them on more power now and to a very large extent that’s going to be fossil fuels. Lomborg is referring here to “primary energy” – that’s everything from oil for cars and generators to wood burned on fires to coal burned in power plants. The International Energy Agency has just released a report on what it thinks will be happen to the energy mix in sub-Saharan Africa under its “new policies scenario”. Lomborg’s figures seem to be out of date. The IEA says that in the year 2040, some 47 per cent of all energy in sub-Saharan Africa will come from burning biomass (wood, dung, coal etc) which it hopes will be burned in more efficient cookstoves that will reduce the health costs and deaths from indoor air pollution. Lomborg had this figure at 35 per cent. By 2040, coal’s share of primary energy actually drops from 18 per cent to 15 per cent. Oil provides 17 per cent of energy, gas about 11 per cent and renewables about nine per cent (almost six per cent of this is from ‘new green energy’ such as solar and wind with the rest coming from hydro power). But here’s the real kicker. The IEA says its scenario for Africa is “broadly consistent” with global warming of between 3C and 6C for the continent by the end of this century with a wide array of dangerous and some might argue catastrophic impacts (some of which the IPCC says the continent would be powerless to adapt to). What seems clear then is that the International Energy Agency’s “new policies scenario” is not particularly appetising for Africa. But back to Brisbane. Within minutes of the brief protest from youth climate campaigners, there was another injection of reality. News began filtering through of the deal between the leaders of the world’s top two emitters of greenhouse gases – the United States and China. The US would cut its emissions by between 26 and 28 per cent by 2025 and China promises its emissions will peak and start to fall by the year 2030 – all in the name of limiting global warming to 2C (whether these cuts are enough is questionable, with early analysis from one respected team of climate analysts suggesting even deeper cuts will be needed). Inside the cocoon of an event where the main sponsors don’t accept that human caused climate change is even real, the news from Beijing seemed to further outline how rapidly the world could change – whether the coal industry likes it or not. As for this weekend’s G20 Leaders Summit, Australia Prime Minister Tony Abbott has been coming under pressure to find a place for climate change in the discussions. If the issue is raised behind the closed-doors sessions, then it will be against Abbott’s wishes. Gone also, apparently, are discussions about cutting fossil fuel subsidies that have featured at previous G20 meetings (a new report finds G20 countries are subsidizing exploration for coal, oil and gas to the tune of US$88 billion a year – between $2.9 billion and $3.5 billion from Australia). The contents of the glossy G20 “delegate publication” reveals much about how the hosts want world leaders to see the future. In 158 pages of adverts, sponsored features, ministerial forewords and articles from academics and think tank fellows, there’s a barrage of impenetrable corporate management speak concerned with “growth”, “free trade” and “economic governance”. The phrase “climate change” appears only four times. The first two pages are devoted to an advert for the mining industry. The #G20 ""delegate publication"" has mining ad across page 2 and 3 and Peabody Energy coal ad on page 14 #priorities pic.twitter.com/g4VdDHakNz"
"Tony Abbott insists he is not focusing on “hypothetical” long-term emissions reduction targets in the “far distant future”, as pressure mounts on Australia to respond to Wednesday’s surprise announcement by the United States and China. “I’m focusing not on what might happen in 16 years’ time, I’m focusing on what we’re doing now and we’re not talking, we’re acting,” Abbott told journalists in Burma.   “We are actually cutting our emissions and as a result of the Direct Action policy, which passed through our parliament in the last couple of weeks, I am absolutely confident that we will deliver on our target of a 5% cut by 2020. This is what we want – we want real action and that’s exactly what the world will get from Australia.  “It is all very well to talk about what might happen in the far distant future but we are going to meet our 5% reduction target within six years. So, we are talking about the here and now ... We are talking about the practical; we are talking about the real. We are not talking about what might hypothetically happen 15, 20, 25, 30 years down the track,” he said. Long-term targets present a problem for the Australian government because deeper emission cuts would be very expensive under its Direct Action policy, which plans to hold competitive auctions for government grants to companies and organisations that want to reduce carbon output. Using Direct Action to achieve an Australian greenhouse gas reduction target for 2025 which would match the new US promises could cost as much as $30bn, the Climate Institute has calculated. In contrast to the prime minister’s remarks, the environment minister, Greg Hunt, said Australia would announce its post-2020 target in the first half of next year, ahead of the United Nations conference in December where it is hoped an international climate deal will be clinched. Hunt said Australia’s existing target to reduce emissions by 5% by 2020 was very close to the emissions reduction the US would achieve by that date, but neither he nor the treasurer, Joe Hockey, would say whether the new US post-2025 target would also be a benchmark for Australia’s longer-term pledge. Obama has promised to cut US emissions by between 26% and 28% by 2025, compared with 2005 levels. Australia measures emissions cuts against 2000 levels, and calculated in that way an equivalent 2025 target for Australia would be about 30%. Calculating the cuts necessary to achieve that target from Australia’s current emissions trajectory, the Climate Institute says it would cost $9bn in 2025 to buy the necessary abatement at a very low $8 to $9 a tonne, or $30bn if carbon abatement costs closer to $30 a tonne in 2025, as projected by Treasury. The current $2.5bn emissions reduction fund is designed only to meet the 2020 target, which is set to become an easier objective because Australia’s emissions have fallen with the closure of heavy industry and the rapid take-up of rooftop solar and other renewables. Hunt said Australia was “currently reviewing” its post-2020 climate policy. The government has not said how the post-2020 target will be set or whether it will draw on the advice of the expert Climate Change Authority, which it has so far been unable to abolish. It is understood officials from the departments of foreign affairs and environment are working on policy options. But according to the Climate Institute chief executive, John Connor, an emissions reduction fund on its own is not going to be able to reach a deeper target. He said the government would need to vary its policy in ways it has so far ruled out – including setting tough “safeguards” to effectively create a baseline and credit emissions trading scheme for industry, or allowing the purchase of less expensive international carbon credits. “Plainly, the ERF by itself does not add up to credible climate policy. It needs to be replaced or significantly boosted with policies that put the responsibility back on the polluter. This means adding super strong safeguard measures and regulatory limits on major emitters and access to international markets,” Connor said."
"In the world’s biggest coalmine, even a 400 tonne truck looks like a toy. Everything about the scale of Peabody Energy’s operations in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming is big and the mines are only going to get bigger – despite new warnings from the United Nations on the dangerous burning of fossil fuels, despite Barack Obama’s promises to fight climate change, and despite reports that coal is in its death throes. At the east pit of Peabody’s North Antelope Rochelle mine, the layer of coal takes up 60ft of a 250ft trough in the earth, and runs in an uninterrupted black stripe for 50 miles.  With those vast, easy-to-reach deposits, Powder River has overtaken West Virginia and Kentucky as the big coalmining territory. The pro-coal Republicans’ takeover of Congress in the mid-term elections also favours Powder River. “You’re looking at the world’s largest mine,” said Scott Durgin, senior vice-president for Peabody’s operations in the Powder River Basin, watching the giant machinery at work. “This is one of the biggest seams you will ever see. This particular shovel is one of the largest shovels you can buy, and that is the largest truck you can buy.” By Durgin’s rough estimate, the mine occupies 100 square miles of high treeless prairie, about the same size as Washington DC. It contains an estimated three billion tonnes of coal reserves. It would take Peabody 25 or 30 years to mine it all. But it’s still not big enough.  On the conference room wall, a map of North Antelope Rochelle shows two big shaded areas containing an estimated one billion tonnes of coal. Peabody is preparing to acquire leasing rights when they come up in about 2022 or 2024. “You’ve got to think way ahead,” said Durgin. In the fossil fuel jackpot that is Wyoming, it can be hard to see a future beyond coal. One of the few who can is LJ Turner, whose grandfather and father homesteaded on the high treeless plains nearly a century ago.  Turner, who raises sheep and cattle, said his business had suffered in the 30 years of the mines’ explosive growth. Dust from the mines was aggravating pneumonia among his Red Angus calves. One year, he lost 25 calves, he said. “We are making a national sacrifice out of this region,” he said. “Peabody coal and other coal companies want to keep on mining, and mine this country out and leave it as a sacrifice and they want to do it for their bottom line. It’s not for the United States. They want to sell it overseas, and I want to see that stopped.” As do some of the most powerful people on the planet. About 120 world leaders met at the United Nations (UN) in September to commit to fighting climate change – many noting that the evidence of warming was occurring in real time. Obama last year proposed new rules that will make it almost impossible to build new coal power plants. Last week, an exhaustive UN report from the world’s top scientists warned of “severe, widespread and irreversible impacts” without dramatic cuts in greenhouse gas emissions.  Coal is also facing competition from cheap natural gas. Peabody had a very bad year in 2013, losing $525m (£328m) as global demand for coal flatlined. But despite the promises from Obama and other world leaders the use of coal for energy rose again last year in America, Europe and in Asia - and so did the emissions that cause climate change. Peabody continued to post losses this year. But extraction and revenue from the Powder River Basin mines went up - and company officials say they could ship out even more coal if they could just get the trains to run on time.  On an average day, 21 long freight trains full of coal leave North Antelope Rochelle bound for 100 power plants across the country. But the company says that’s still not enough. As for climate change – that’s hardly Peabody’s concern.  The company is deeply reluctant to even mention the words. Durgin, who refuses to appear on camera, introduced himself an “active environmentalist, not an environmental activist”. Chris Curran, a Peabody spokesman, refused to talk about climate change or the effects of Obama’s efforts to cut carbon emissions on the company’s profits. “They are only proposed regulations right now. Nothing is going on,” he said. It takes a call to the senior vice-president of corporate communications, Vic Svec, at the head office in St Louis before the company will discuss climate change. As it turns out, the company’s official position is that there is no such thing as human-caused climate change. “We do not question the climate changing. It has been changing for as long as man has recorded history,” Svec said. Climate change was a “modelled crisis”, he went on. “What we would say is that there is still far more understanding that is required for any type of impacts of C02 on carbon concerns.” Asked whether he saw climate change as a threat, Svec said: “Climate concerns are a threat to the extent that they lead to policies that hurt people.” Peabody’s official position on climate science is divorced from scientific reality. But their grasp of the politics of coal clearly is not.  America gets about 40% of its electricity from coal - and by far the biggest share of that coal comes from Powder River. According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), its use of coal for energy rose 4.8% last year, in part because of the Arctic blasts of the polar vortex. Carbon dioxide emissions from energy registered one of their steepest rises in the last quarter century. Australia, where Peabody has three mines and which has the world’s second largest reserves of coal, has ramped up production 37% since 2000, helped by up to $3.5bn in government subsidies to the entire fossil fuel industry, a forthcoming report from the Overseas Development Institute and Oil Change International will say. China has doubled its use of coal over the last decade. India is preparing to open its large coal reserves to foreign mining companies to meet a promise to hook up the 400 million without electricity on to the grid in the next five years. Coal use in Germany rose last year for the third year in a row, even as the country met its ambitious targets to transition to wind and solar power. Poland has been promoting its coal as an alternative to Russian natural gas. Overall global coal use rose 3% last year, faster than any other fossil fuel, according to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy. That’s a disaster in the making, scientists and energy experts say. The International Energy Agency has concluded that two-thirds of all fossil fuels will have to stay in the ground if the world is going to avoid crossing the 2C threshold into dangerous climate change.  Obama agrees. Burning all of those fossil fuels would trigger “dire consequences” for the planet, he told an interviewer last June. “We’re not going to be able to burn it all.” But the reality is that Obama has spent the last six years expanding coal, oil and gas production under his “all of the above” energy strategy.  “We quadrupled the number of operating rigs to a record high. We’ve added enough new oil and gas pipeline to encircle the earth and then some,” Obama told a rally during his 2012 re-election campaign. Coal exports have risen on Obama’s watch, with mining companies shipping some 100m tonnes a year for each of the last three years. Mining companies are actively pursuing plans to expand coal ports and ship more coal overseas, as a back-up market should the incoming Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rules on carbon pollution make it harder to burn coal for electricity. Meanwhile, the federal government, under Obama, gave away $26m last year in tax breaks to the coal industry, according to the Overseas Development Industry report. Even if the president wants to do more to curb coal, the Democrats’ heavy defeat in the mid-term elections means there will be no pull in that direction from Congress. Mitch McConnell, the Republicans’ leader in the Senate ran on a slogan of “Guns, Freedom and Coal”. But even before the mid-terms, campaigners say the rise in coal use under Obama undermines his climate agenda and could wipe out efforts by other countries to fight climate change. Last July, a judge in Colorado agreed, throwing out a mining permit granted by the Bureau of Land Management on the grounds that it would worsen climate change. What’s especially frustrating, campaigners say, is that Powder River Basin coal is on public lands, which means that Obama could intervene to limit future mines. “This whole notion that you can just address the smoke stack is wishful thinking at the end of the day. Why wouldn’t you address the problem from cradle to grave? Why wouldn’t you trace it all the way back to where it is being produced rather than just look at the stack?” said Jeremy Nichols, climate and energy director from Wild Earth Guardians. Campaigners say they see little evidence Obama has tried to curb coal use. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), which oversees extraction on public lands, shows little sign of incorporating Obama’s climate change directive into future planning. The agency came in for scathing criticism from government auditors earlier this year who said the BLM gave up too much control to the mining companies, and sold coal too cheaply, to the detriment of US taxpayers.  Those low prices are crucial to Peabody’s business model. “It’s a high volume, lower priced product and we can still ship literally across the country and compete,” Durgin said. In 2012, the company acquired the rights to mine an additional billion tonnes of coal, paying just $1.11 a tonne. Peabody also pays 12.5% royalties to the US federal government, once the coal is mined. Campaigners say such prices represent a giveaway that allows mining companies like Peabody to keep the prices for Powder River Basin coal artificially low. Campaigners also argue low coal prices make it harder to ramp up production from renewable energy sources like wind and solar. “We have never seen leases of more than a billion tonnes and we are starting to see that under the Obama Administration,” Nichols said.   The Department of Interior, which has final authority over public lands, refused to respond to multiple requests for comment on its efforts to implement Obama’s climate policies.  Instead, a stock email attributed to Jessica Kershaw, the interior spokeswoman, confirmed that Obama was committed to mining more coal. “As part of the Obama Administration’s all-of-the-above energy strategy, the Department of the Interior and specifically the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is committed to the safe and responsible development of both traditional and renewable energy resources on public lands,” the email read.  “The BLM also recognizes that coal is a key component of America’s comprehensive energy portfolio and the nation’s economy.”   The email did not mention climate change. For Peabody though, the aim is expansion. The company produced 134m tonnes of coal from its combined Powder River Basin mines last year, and was on track to increase production this year, Durgin said.  “I’ve been asked when is the end of the mine,” said Durgin. “I don’t know. Economics will tell us that.”So long as Obama pursues policies that keep coal cheap, that end is unlikely to come soon.  "
"Anti-tar sands campaigns have cost the industry a staggering $17bn (£11bn) in lost revenues, and helped to push it onto the backfoot, according to a study by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), and Oil Change International. Another $13.8bn has been lost to transportation bottlenecks and the flood of cheap crude coming from shale oil fields, says the Material Risks report, which presents the first quantification of the impact that environmental campaigners have had on the unconventional energy business.  “Industry officials never anticipated the level and intensity of public opposition to their massive build-out plans,” said Steve Kretzmann, Oil Change International’s executive director. “Legal and other challenges are raising new issues related to environmental protection, indigenous rights and the disruptive impact of new pipeline proposals. Business as usual for Big Oil – particularly in the tar sands – is over.” The industry is currently facing a decline in increased capital expenditure on new tar sands projects, due to problems in transporting the crude, which the study links to public campaigns.  While industry profits continue to fall, the report says that lack of market access helped to stymie three major tar sands enterprises in 2014 alone – Shell’s Pierre River, Total’s Joslyn North and Statoil’s Corner project – which together would have emitted 2.8bn tonnes of CO2. Protests by environmentalists have been swollen by the presence of first nations communities, angry at the environmental damage they fear the industry could wreak on their ancestral lands.  “The taking of resources has left many lands and waters poisoned – the animals and plants are dying in many areas in Canada,” says the Idle No More manifesto. “We have laws older than this colonial government about how to live with the land.” “Tar sands producers face a new kind of risk from growing public opposition,” said Tom Sanzillo, director of finance at IEEFA, and one of the lead authors on the report. “This opposition has achieved a permanent presence as public sentiment evolves and as the influence of organisations opposed to tar sands production continues to grow.” Canada has staked its energy future on a massive expansion of tar sands, which hold the world’s third largest reserve of crude after Saudia Arabia and Venezuela. But the huge amounts of water and solvents needed to extract oil from bitumen dramatically boost greenhouse gas output and, on latest production forecasts, will increase Canada’s CO2 emissions by 56 megatonnes by 2020. The tar sands production process involves steam injection, strip mining and refining, and leaves environmental scars ranging from clear-cut forests to toxic tailing ponds and destroyed farmland. This has pushed the focus of environmental and indigenous land rights protests onto export pipelines, such as the stalled Keystone XL project to send tar sands crude to the US. According to the new paper, the industry’s current inability to build new pipelines has the potential to cancel most, if not all, planned new projects. It says that the 6.9bn barrels of tar sands this could still leave underground by 2030 would be the equivalent of an additional 4.1bn tonnes of CO2 emissions – or the same as 54m average passenger vehicles, over the same period.

"Australia’s most important trading partners and allies, such as China, the US and the European Union are strengthening their responses to climate change. Australia will be left in the wake of these big economies (and big emitters), according to the latest Climate Council report Lagging Behind: Australia and the Global Response to Climate Change.  Australia’s retreat from being a global leader at tackling climate change is as impressive as our recent performances at the cricket. Looking on the bright side, even countries not known for their sunshine like Germany are going solar in a big way. Global momentum is building as more and more countries invest in renewable energy and put a price on carbon.   Thirty-nine countries are putting a price on carbon. The EU and China (now with seven pilot schemes up and running) are home to the two largest carbon markets in the world, together covering over 3,000m tonnes (MtCO2) of carbon dioxide emissions. There’s also plenty of action in the US: 10 states with a combined population of 79 million are now using carbon pricing to drive down emissions, including California, the world’s ninth largest economy.  Yet, here in Australia, we now hold the dubious distinction of being the first country to repeal an operating and effective carbon price.  Like carbon pricing, support for renewables is also advancing worldwide. In the last year, more renewable energy capacity was added than fossil fuels. Globally renewables attracted greater investment with US$192bn spent on new renewable power compared to US$102bn in fossil fuel plants. China is leading the charge on expanding renewable capacity. At the end of last year, China had installed a whopping 378GW of renewable energy capacity – about a quarter of renewables capacity installed worldwide, and over seven times Australia’s entire grid-connected power capacity. China continues to work towards ambitious capacity targets for 439GW of renewables by 2015 and 900GW by 2020. China is also acting to limit coal consumption in an effort to tackle air pollution and climate change. Despite over 1m households installing solar power on their rooftops, uncertainty looms large over Australia’s renewable energy target. This uncertainty is stifling investment – 70% less in 2014 compared with the previous year. Australia’s commitment to tackling climate change resembles a teenager’s resolve to get out of bed in the morning. The federal government’s shiny new Direct Action plan, with a lofty 5% emissions reduction target, has been described by some as a “Mickey Mouse” scheme. Yet as the host of the upcoming G20 Summit in Brisbane, rather than shirtfronting other member countries, Australia has an ideal opportunity to work with the international community and join the big guns – China, the US and the EU – in making progress on climate change."
"The high stakes political standoff over the renewable energy target will freeze new investment, cause the collapse of existing projects and within a few years trigger a “penalty” provision that would hike power bills by three times as much as the now-repealed carbon tax. The renewable energy industry, Labor and the Greens are adamant these dire consequences are entirely the fault of the Abbott government, accusing the Coalition of breaking its election promise to keep the RET, abandoning bipartisanship over the policy and proposing drastic cuts to the target that would be even worse for the industry.  The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, said there was no point continuing with the talks “because Tony Abbott is a climate change sceptic and election promise breaker” and “there is no point in leading people up the garden path” or having negotiations with people who didn’t want to negotiate. Labor has now joined the Greens and the Palmer United party in staring down the government, refusing to make major changes to the target that requires Australia to install 41,000 gigawatt hours of renewable energy by 2020.  The environment minister, Greg Hunt, said the government was “surprised” by Labor’s decision and “our door remains open”. He said the 41,000 gigawatt hour target was “neither sustainable nor achievable.” The opposition’s high stakes strategy relies on public pressure forcing the government to back down and publicly agree to keep the RET. If it does not, uncertainty will mean investment stalls anyway, the price of renewable energy certificates will remain around half what existing projects had factored in to their financing and within one or two years there will be no certificates for electricity retailers to buy. When that happens the RET legislation requires retailers to pay a penalty price of $92 per megawatt hour – an outcome that would cause an increase in the average power bill of about 30%. The carbon tax increased electricity bills by about 9%, and many households received compensation for its impact. Kane Thornton, chief executive of the Clean Energy Council, said a continued stalemate would mean no new investment and the real risk that some existing projects would fall over, but the government’s proposed cuts in the target “would definitely have been an even worse scenario.”  John Grimes, chief executive of the Australian Solar Council, said the investment freeze caused by the uncertainty of a long political stand-off was likely to trigger the penalty price, but if it did the 30% increase in power bills “will be entirely Tony Abbott’s fault.” “Tony Abbott walked away from the bipartisan policy and if it comes to that he would be the one imposing a massive new tax on every electricity consumer.” “Tony Abbott hates solar, he hates wind … any suggestion the end of talks is Labor’s fault is just outrageous … no deal is better than a bad deal and the government was only offering a bad deal,” he said. But Queensland Nationals senator Matthew Canavan said rising prices would be Labor’s fault. “In just a couple of years, we will probably not have enough energy to meet the target. That will mean electricity producers will have to pay a renewable shortfall charge of $92 per megawatt hour, almost three times the current price. This will be a carbon tax by another name. Even in opposition, the Labor party is finding a way to increase electricity prices,” he said. The head of Pacific Hydro, Lane Crockett, said the renewable industry was in “deep crisis … as a result of the uncertainty that the government has created” and called for a bipartisan solution. And Greens leader Christine Milne said the industry was in crisis because of “the prime minister’s ideological zealotry against renewable energy … his steadfast intention to undermine renewable energy and promote coal.” The government had originally signalled it wanted even deeper cuts to the target – which was intended to deliver 20% renewables by 2020 but due to declining energy demand will now deliver more like 27%. It commissioned businessman and self-professed climate sceptic Dick Warburton to undertake a review. Its main recommendation was for the target to be slashed to about 16,000 gigawatt hours. But after fierce resistance from industry and concerted criticism of that review, the federal cabinet asked Hunt and the industry minister, Ian Macfarlane, to try to reach a bipartisan agreement about the future of the program that would allow continued investment without fear of policy change. Macfarlane said the government wanted a target representing a “real” 20% of the current energy market – probably about 26,000 gigawatt hours – with no change to the subsidies for household rooftop solar panels and a full exemption from the scheme for all energy-intensive industries, such as aluminium, copper, zinc and cement. Several modelling exercises have refuted Abbott’s original suggestion that the RET had to change because in its current form it was forcing up power prices. ACIL Allen modelling done for Abbott’s own review showed the current target would increase the average household bill by an average of $54 a year between now and 2020, but would reduce bills by a similar annual amount over the following decade compared with what they would be if the RET were repealed. That modelling used assumptions highly unfavourable to renewable energy, including that coal and gas prices would remain almost unchanged until 2040. Separate modelling for the Clean Energy Council by Roam Consulting – with different assumptions about gas prices – found that bills would be $50 a year lower by 2020 if the RET were retained. Another modelling exercise, commissioned by three business groups from Deloitte, found household bills would rise by at most about $50 a year."
"A Queensland farmer has carved a giant message to G20 leaders in one of his paddocks, telling them to prioritise climate change action. Rob McCreath ploughed “Go solar” on his land after Brisbane airport rejected a billboard calling for climate change to be added to the G20 agenda.  He hopes world leaders will see his message and pressure the Australian government to do more about emissions and renewable energy. “Australia is now well into raging drought,” he said on Thursday. “I can’t believe we don’t make better use of our solar resources.” Climate change is not on the official agenda for the G20 summit in Brisbane next week, although energy efficiency will be discussed. McCreath said other developed countries, such as Germany, appreciated the gravity of climate change and were promoting solar energy. He said he hoped the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, would ask Tony Abbott in Brisbane why Australia couldn’t follow the German lead and go solar. The display on McCreath’s property in Felton, near Toowoomba, took about four hours to create. “It didn’t take all that long to plough but it took me quite a long time to mark out the letters because I didn’t want to get the spelling wrong,” he said. McCreath could not guarantee leaders would see his work and it was not clear whether their planes would fly over it. “We’ve all got to do what we can, as individuals,” he said."
"At this point, the scientists who run the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change must feel like it’s time to trade their satellites, their carefully calibrated thermometers and spectrometers, their finely tuned computer models – all of them for a thesaurus. Surely, somewhere, there must be words that will prompt the world’s leaders to act. This week, with the release of their new synthesis report, they are trying the words “severe, widespread, and irreversible” to describe the effects of climate change – which for scientists, conservative by nature, falls just short of announcing that climate change will produce a zombie apocalypse plus random beheadings plus Ebola. It’s hard to imagine how they will up the language in time for the next big global confab in Paris.  But even with all that, this new document – actually a synthesis of three big working group reports released over the last year – almost certainly underestimates the actual severity of the situation. As the Washington Post pointed out this week, past reports have always tried to err on the side of understatement; it’s a particular problem with sea level rise, since the current IPCC document does not even include the finding in May that the great Antarctic ice sheets have begun to melt. (The studies were published after the IPCC’s cutoff date.) But when you get right down to it, who cares? The scientists have done their job; no sentient person, including Republican Senate candidates, can any longer believe in their heart of hearts that there’s not a problem here. The scientific method has triumphed: over a quarter of a century, researchers have reached astonishing consensus on a basic problem in chemistry and physics. And the engineers have done just as well. The price of a solar panel has dropped by more than 90% over the last 25 years, and continues to plummet. In the few places they have actually been deployed at scale, the results are astonishing: there were days this summer when Germany generated 75% of its power from the wind and the sun. That, of course, is not because Germany is so richly endowed with sunlight (it’s a rare person who books a North Sea beach holiday). It’s because the Germans have produced a remarkable quantity of political will, and put it to good use. As opposed to the rest of the world, where the fossil fuel industry has produced an enormous amount of fear in the political class, and kept things from changing. Their vast piles of money have so far weighed more in the political balance than the vast piles of data accumulated by the scientists. In fact, the IPCC can calculate the size of the gap with great exactness. To get on the right track, they estimate, the world would have to cut fossil fuel investments annually between now and 2029, and use the money instead to push the pace of renewables. That is a hard task, but not an impossible one. Indeed, the people’s movement symbolised by September’s mammoth climate march in New York, has begun to make an impact in dollars and cents. A new report this week shows that by delaying the Keystone pipeline in North America protesters have prevented at least $17bn (£10.6bn) in new investments in the tar sands of Canada – investments that would have produced carbon equivalent to 735 coal-fired power plants. That’s pretty good work. Our political leaders could do much more, of course. If they put a serious price on carbon, we would move quickly out of the fossil fuel age and into the renewable future. But that won’t happen until we break the power of the fossil fuel industry. That’s why it’s very good news that divestment campaigners have been winning victories on one continent after another, as universities from Stanford to Sydney to Glasgow start selling their fossil fuel stocks in protest – hey, even the Rockefeller Brothers fund, heir to the greatest oil fortune ever, have joined in the fight. Breaking the power of the fossil fuel industry won’t be easy, especially since it has to happen fast. It has to happen, in fact, before the carbon we’ve unleashed into the atmosphere breaks the planet. I’m not certain we’ll win this fight – but, thanks to the IPCC, no one will ever be able to say they weren’t warned."

"Over the past decades, scientists have made many measurements across the globe to characterize how fast the Earth is warming. It may seem trivial, but taking the Earth’s temperature is not very straightforward. You could use temperature thermometers at weather stations that are spread across the globe. Measurements can be taken daily and information sent to central repositories where some average is determined.  A downside of thermometers is that they do not cover the entire planet – large polar regions, oceans, and areas in the developing world have no or very few measurements. Another problem is that they may change over time. Perhaps the thermometers are replaced or moved, or perhaps the landscape around the thermometers changes which could impact the reading. And of course, measurements of the ocean regions are a whole other story.  An alternative technique is to use satellites to extract temperatures from radiative emission at microwave frequencies from oxygen in the atmosphere. Satellites can cover the entire globe and thereby avoid the problem with discrete sensors. However, satellites also change over time, their orbit can change, or their detection devices can also change.  Another issue with satellites is that the measurements are made throughout the atmosphere that can contain contaminants to corrupt the measurement. For instance, it is possible that water droplets (either in clouds or precipitation) can influence the temperature readings. So, it is clear that there are strengths and weaknesses to any temperature measurement method. You would hope that either method would tell a similar story, and they do to some extent, but there are key differences. Basically, the lower atmosphere (troposphere) is heating slower than the Earth surface.  In fact, for the time period 1987–2006, the temperatures among the four groups that collect satellite data ranges from 0.086°C per decade to 0.22°C per decade. In more recent years, the trend is much reduced, and for two of the leading satellite groups (University of Alabama at Huntsville and Remote Sensing Systems), temperatures are basically flat. The recent flatness in satellite temperatures as surface temperatures continue to rise has presented a quandary for scientists. Are both results real? Is there some reason they diverge? Is one measurement more accurate than the other? This is one of the areas of very active research.  A contribution to this question appeared last week by researcher Fuzhong Weng and his colleagues. The paper, published in Climate Dynamics, claimed to find the reason for much of that difference – the authors report that the satellite trends could be off (too cold) by perhaps 30%. If true, this work would go a long way toward reconciling the differences between surface and satellite measurements. While this paper is getting a lot of attention, I am suggesting a more cautious approach. There are a number of issues and questions which must be answered before we can close the books on this issue and the paper has received some critical attention from other scientists. Before we get into that, let’s talk about what the study found and how they made their discovery.  For a few decades, satellites have measured radiant emission from oxygen in the atmosphere and have related these measurements to temperatures. As satellites orbit the Earth, the microwave instrument on-board scans the atmosphere below them every 8 seconds or so and scientists apply what are called weighting functions to extract information from different altitudes. Each of the microwave “channels” uses a different weighting function so as to obtain information at different heights. The four channels most associated with atmospheric temperatures are Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit channels 3, 5, 7, and 9 in the current fleet of satellites.  The radiant emission received by the satellite can be influenced by other components in the atmosphere, in particular cloud liquid water. Many years ago, the impact of cloud liquid water was considered and various attempts were made to eliminate its influence through a filtering process. It is well known that cloud liquid water can influence the measurements, the real question is by how much?  The vigorous debate from the 1990s has been rekindled in the present Weng study. This new work segregates the Earth system by levels of cloudiness and precipitation in the atmosphere. The authors term “clear-sky” conditions corresponding to less than 10 grams of water per square meter of surface area. The authors then envisioned a cloud layer atop a raining region whose total height extends approximately 4 km vertically from the Earth surface.  In their analysis, they considered different droplet sizes ranging from .05 mm to 1 mm. Finally, the impact on the satellite channels (AMSU-A channels 3, 5, 7, and 9) was determined. It was found that the lowest channel (channel 3 which is primarily focused on the near surface region) was significantly impacted by the presence of cloud liquid water.  As you move higher into the atmosphere, the impact on temperatures was much reduced. When you look at the trends (change in temperatures with time), the two lowest elevation channels are higher when the impacts of clouds are removed. What this means is, measurements made in cloudy skies gives a lower warming trend of the atmosphere.   The authors state, A decrease in brightness temperature can be associated with cloud and precipitation scattering, rather than physical temperature in the lower and middle troposphere and therefore, trends from microwave sounding data could be misleading if the brightness temperature from all weather conditions are averaged as representative of atmospheric physical temperature. The trend calculated from the clear-sky data is thus not only larger but also more reliable ... It is shown that the atmospheric warming trends in the middle latitudes are significantly larger when cloud effects are removed … The scattering and emission effect of clouds and precipitation significantly reduces the values of the warm trends in the low and middle troposphere derived from microwave data. Simply put, when you eliminate the effect of clouds, the atmosphere is warming faster than we thought and the divergence between land thermometers and satellites largely disappears. Of course, whenever a study that is this significant is published, there is deserved skepticism. We have to be guarded in our acceptance until further work is done and until other teams have had a chance to review the findings. I asked others who work in this area to find their impressions. Dr. Roy Spencer, who works on satellite temperature measurements at the University of Alabama Huntsville and was involved in the inception of the methodology told me,  In agreement with what we published 18 years ago, we believe the Weng study greatly overestimates the contaminating effects of clouds on satellite temperature trends, possibly due to the omission of large areas from data processing which leads to spurious effects (like their finding of a large cloud influence on the AMSU stratospheric channel, which is not possible). Using the same satellite data but a different methodology, we obtain a spurious -0.0015 degree C/decade cooling effect for global ocean tropospheric temperature trends, 1998–2014. This is over an order of magnitude smaller than other errors we try to pin down in our data processing. So, the verdict is still out but this is something we want to keep our eyes open for over the coming months and years as teams sharpen their attention on whether this finding is robust or not."
"I congratulate Paul Kingsnorth on the literary award for his innovative novel The Wake (A novel approach to the use of Old English, 10 November), but seriously question his environmental activism. Kingsnorth’s Dark Mountain project, described as “a network of artists, writers and thinkers who basically see the world as being doomed – ecologically and economically”, is hardly the message we need to hear in the week following the 2014 report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change setting out the challenging, but achievable, targets for control of carbon release and temperature rise; in fact, for our Earth’s survival. This despairing doomsday scenario emerges clearly in Kingsnorth’s recent review of two books (The four degrees, London Review of Books, 23 October). The first, George Marshall’s Don’t Even Think About It, is heavily influenced by US psychologists, Dan Kahan and Daniel Kahneman, who clearly share the pessimistic doomsday scenario. The second, Naomi Klein’s deeply researched This Changes Everything: Capitalism v The Climate, is peremptorily dismissed by Kingsnorth as “an American liberal wishlist”. The climate-change threat is the ultimate challenge to human creativity and capacity for change. This is no time for our creative elites to be opting for despairing nihilism. Realism with optimism is the Arts Social Action way.Ralph WindleArts Social Action, Witney, Oxfordshire  • The G20 countries’ handout of $88bn a year in fossil-fuel subsidies is appalling (Report, 11 November). The new report’s recognition that investments through RBS and UK Export Finance are UK subsidies is particularly important. But we need to go even further. The support of the government for frontier oil drilling also includes diplomatic and military intervention on behalf of oil companies. The Foreign Office maintained a consulate in Basra whose job largely consisted of supporting UK oil companies, with three diplomats on staff and a £6.5m budget. High-profile UK political figures appear on request of oil companies for deal signing, such as Chris Huhne attending the signing ceremony during BPs first attempt to broker a deal with Russia’s Rosneft. If these forms of support don’t add hugely to the figures governments spend on supporting fossil fuels, they certainly add billions to oil companies’ balance sheets through enabling major deals. Moreover, according to our calculations, if the UK’s tax regime was modelled on Norway’s, the country’s budget would have received an extra £74bn due to windfall profits on oil in the years 2002-08. We need not just to stop handing out tax breaks to oil companies, but to change the taxation regime in the first place, instead of catering to oil companies’ every whim.Anna GalkinaPlatform"
"“It’s like we’ve forgotten who we are,” the hero of Interstellar complains. “Explorers, pioneers, not caretakers ... We’re not meant to save the world. We’re meant to leave it.” This could be the epigraph of our age. Don’t get me wrong. Interstellar is a magnificent film, true to the richest traditions of science fiction, visually and auditorily astounding. See past the necessary silliness and you will find a moving exploration of parenthood, separation and ageing. It is also a classic exposition of two of the great themes of our age: technological optimism and political defeatism.  The Earth and its inhabitants are facing planetary catastrophe, caused by “six billion people, and every one of them trying to have it all”, which weirdly translates into a succession of blights, trashing the world’s crops and sucking the oxygen out of the atmosphere. (When your major receipts are in the United States, you can’t afford to earn the hatred of the broadcast media by mentioning climate change. The blight, an obvious substitute, has probably averted millions of dollars of lost takings). The civilisational collapse at the start of the film is intercut with interviews featuring veterans of the dustbowl of the 1930s. Their worn faces prefigure the themes of ageing and loss. But they also remind us inadvertently of a world of political agency. Great follies were committed, but big, brave things were done to put them right: think of the New Deal and the Civilian Conservation Corps. That world is almost as different from our own as the planets visited by Interstellar’s astronauts. They leave the Earth to find a place to which humans can escape or, if that fails, a world in which a cargo of frozen embryos can be deposited. It takes an effort, when you emerge from the cinema, to remember that such fantasies are taken seriously by millions of adults, who consider them a realistic alternative to addressing the problems we face on Earth. Nasa runs a website devoted to the idea. It claims that gigantic spaceships, “could be wonderful places to live; about the size of a California beach town and endowed with weightless recreation, fantastic views, freedom, elbow-room in spades, and great wealth”. Of course, no one could leave, except to enter another spaceship, and the slightest malfunction would cause instant annihilation. But “settlements in earth orbit will have one of the most stunning views in our solar system – the living, ever-changing Earth.” We can look back and remember how beautiful it was. And then there’s the money to be made. “Space colonization is, at its core, a real estate business,” the Nasa website goes on. “Those that colonize space will control vast lands, enormous amounts of electrical power, and nearly unlimited material resources. [This] will create wealth beyond our wildest imagination and wield power – hopefully for good rather than for ill.” In other words, we would leave not only the Earth behind, but also ourselves. That’s a common characteristic of such fantasies: their lack of imagination. Wild flights of technological fancy are accompanied by a stolid incapacity to picture the inner life of those who might inhabit such systems. People who would consider the idea of living in the Gobi Desert intolerable – where, an estate agent might point out, there is oxygen, radiation-screening, atmospheric pressure and 1 g of gravity – rhapsodise about living on Mars. People who imagine that human life on Earth will end because of power and greed and oppression imagine that we will be able to escape these forces in pressure vessels controlled by technicians, in which we would be trapped like tadpoles in a jamjar. If space colonisation is impossible today – when Richard Branson, for all his billions, cannot even propel people safely past the atmosphere – how will it look in a world that has fallen so far into disaster that leaving it for a lifeless, airless lump of rock would be perceived as a good option? We would be lucky in these circumstances to possess the wherewithal to make bricks. Only by understanding this as a religious impulse can we avoid the conclusion that those who gleefully await this future are insane. Just as it is easier to pray for life after death than it is to confront oppression, this fantasy permits us to escape the complexities of life on Earth for a starlit wonderland beyond politics. In Interstellar, as in many other versions of the story – think of Battlestar Galactica and Red Planet – space is heaven, overseen by a benign Technology, peopled by delivering angels with oxygen tanks. Space colonisation is an extreme version of a common belief: that it is easier to adapt to our problems than to solve them. Earlier this year, the economist Andrew Lilico argued in the Telegraph that we cannot afford to prevent escalating climate change, so instead we must learn to live with it. He was challenged on Twitter to explain how people in the tropics might adapt to a world in which four degrees of global warming had taken place. He replied: “I imagine tropics adapt to 4C world by being wastelands with few folk living in them. Why’s that not an option?” Re-reading Lilico’s article in the light of this comment, I realised that it hinged on the word “we”. When the headline maintained that “We have failed to prevent global warming, so we must adapt to it”, the “we” referred in these instances to different people. We who live in the rich world can brook no taxation to encourage green energy, or regulation to discourage the consumption of fossil fuels. We cannot adapt even to an extra penny of taxation. But the other “we”, which turns out to mean “they” – the people of the tropics – can and must adapt to the loss of their homes, their land and their lives, as entire regions become wastelands. Why is that not an option? The lives of the poor appear unimaginable to people in his position, like the lives of those who might move to another planet or a space station. So reducing the amount of energy we consume and replacing fossil fuels with other sources – simple and cheap as these are by comparison to all other options – is inconceivable and outrageous, while the mass abandonment of much of the inhabited surface of the world is a realistic and reasonable request. “It is not contrary to reason to prefer the destruction of the whole world to the scratching of my finger,” the 18th century philosopher David Hume noted, and here we see his contemplation reified. But at least Lilico could explain what he meant, in contrast with most of those who talk breezily about adapting to climate breakdown. Relocating cities to higher ground? Moving roads and railways, diverting rivers, depopulating nations, leaving the planet? Never mind the details. Technology, our interstellar god, will sort it out, some day, somehow. Technological optimism and political defeatism: this is a formula for the deferment of hard choices to an ever receding netherland of life after planetary death. No wonder it is popular. • Twitter: @georgemonbiot. A fully referenced version of this article can be found at Monbiot.com"
"Hyundai and Kia have agreed to pay $100m (£62m) in fines and forfeit $200m in credits for misleading customers about the fuel economy of more than a million cars sold in the US. Monday’s fine for the South Korean car-makers is the largest in the 50-year history of the Clean Air Act, and could set a precedent for Ford and other car companies audited for similar practices.  Hyundai and Kia agreed to the fines after the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Justice Department found the car-makers had misled consumers about fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions on several models, including the popular Accent and Elantra. After fuel prices spiked in 2008, Hyundai gained a marketing edge by claiming that its cars got 40 miles per gallon in highway driving. The inflated fuel economy claims involved about 1.2m vehicles, about a quarter of the 2011-2013 models sold in the US, the EPA found. “Hyundai and Kia gave consumers inaccurate information about the real-world fuel economy performance of many of these vehicles,” the EPA said in a statement on Monday. The agency said the car-makers chose the most favourable results, rather than the average, when processing test data, inflating fuel economy by one to six miles per gallon. They understated greenhouse gas emissions of their fleets by about 4.75m metric tons over the estimated lifetime of the vehicles. The company claimed at the time that engineers running the tests had made mistakes. They lowered the claims, and offered compensation to car owners for the extra fuel costs. Under the agreement, the EPA said the companies accepted an audit of the 2015 and 2016 models, and to overhaul test protocols before its 2017 models come to market. The companies will also give up 4.75m carbon credits. Those credits had allowed Kia and Hyundai to go on selling the big gas-guzzling models that remain popular with American consumers. The EPA said they were worth more than $200m. David Zuchowski, Hyundai’s chief executive in the US, said in a statement: “Hyundai has acted transparently, reimbursed affected customers and fully cooperated with the EPA throughout the course of its investigation. “We are happy to put this behind us.” Since the 2012 audit of Hyundai, the EPA has taken a closer look at other car company claims. Ford, Mercedes-Benz and other companies have reduced mileage claims for some models after EPA audits. “Businesses that play by the rules shouldn’t have to compete with those breaking the law,” the EPA administrator, Gina McCarthy, said on Monday. “This settlement upholds the integrity of the nation’s fuel economy and greenhouse gas programs and supports all Americans who want to save fuel costs and reduce their environmental impact.” In June, Ford admitted to overstating mileage claims and agreed to compensate owners for extra fuel costs. The company said the initial mileage claims were a mistake."
"25 months and counting “I would annex the planets if I could,” wrote Cecil Rhodes, arch colonialist, mining magnate and architect of division in Southern Africa. “It makes me sad to see them so clear and yet so far.”   His gaze represented an insatiability, an obsession with expansion and disregard for consequences at the peak of empire that marks the global economy still, now at the zenith of the fossil fuel age. We’re hypnotised by an Icarus complex that pushes us passed the point of extraordinary human accomplishment within real world boundaries, to transgress them, over-reach and invite self-destruction. Recent research speculated that advanced technological development like that enjoyed by a minority of humanity today probably could not happen anywhere without cashing in a once-in-history planetary inheritance of concentrated fossil fuel energy.  This would be the case, it is thought, regardless of which planet you found yourself on, and which complex lifeform your civilisation was made up of. Any such planet taking advantage of such an energy source would then get one chance to kick the carbon habit and shift to benign sources before the civilisation wrecked its own life support systems.  We find ourselves at this point, as the new synthesis report on climate change from the IPCC just made clear. The tale of Daedalus and Icarus – father and son craftsmen caught up as playthings in the mythological machinations of gods, kings and princesses – is richer than the popular interpretation of simple hubris suggests.  A tale of spellbound youth intoxicated by ability, it’s also the tale of Daedalus the father and master craftsman who, understanding the tolerances of the physical materials he worked with, escaped imprisonment, flew and lived. He didn’t go too near the sun and took the benefits.  Our task, like him, is to use our judgment to thrive within limits. We need to be able to identify which choices represent self-destructive over-reach, and which allow for exuberant play and aspiration within the tolerances of the world. Easy to write, but tricky to do in practice. Much attention was given recently the final realisation of one of science fiction’s great popular promises – the flying car. For the cost of £172,000 you can now drive and fly without have to park first, though I imagine it takes a while for the wings to fix into place and you still have to find a take-off and landing strip. Nice, if you can afford it, and let’s not mention the fuel efficiency.  But perhaps a better objective would first be to have safe and generous bike lanes in our cities, allowing the democratic liberation of citizens able to fly on wheels through urban spaces. Then there is the inescapable symbolism of the catastrophic and fatal failure of Virgin Galactic’s test flight for their venture into space tourism. The company first reported the crash with a technical euphemism, saying there had been an ‘in-flight anomaly.’ A hot debate is now underway concerning the long-standing safety of the project. But even to a casual observer there is a seemingly inexplicable contradiction between Richard Branson’s publicly-touted concern for climate change, and his simultaneous glamorisation of fuel-intensive aviation, space tourism and lobbying on behalf of the industry’s expansion. Restless Rhodes-like ambitions hypnotise the media while extraordinary Daedalus like achievements go largely unregarded.  While the climate campaign 10:10 has slipped from the headlines, quietly it has been encouraging an energy revolution. The 10:10 campaign #ItsHappening does what it says on the hashtag. From solar schools to ‘floating’ bike roundabouts, they highlight success stories of cutting carbon use. Elsewhere, the annual Ashden Awards celebrate projects in developed countries switching to renewable energy, from households to neighbourhoods and whole towns. They also recognise and reward international examples in much poorer countries where millions have no access to electricity, where dirty energy development is being leap-frogged and people are going straight to renewables. Like the ‘in-fight anomaly’, some seem to need jargon to soften the hard edges of the choices we need to make to be a Daedalus, not an Icarus. Another example came in the chorus of comment about the EU’s recent setting of targets to cut greenhouse emissions and boost renewable energy by 2030 – this was the ‘plausibility of mitigation’. In other words, what are the chances of action to stop us going to hell in a global warming handcart?  Given the lack of action elsewhere in the world, the pressure was great to welcome an EU target of cutting emissions 40% (even if there was no meaningful plan to make it happen). But, as the climate scientist Kevin Anderson at the Tyndall Centre, Manchester University, pointed out, to deliver on the EU promise of not passing 2C of warming, you need a cut of 80%. Meanwhile, the other-planet annexing spirit of Cecil Rhodes is alive and well. Next month there is a meeting in The Hague to discuss the ‘governance of space mineral resources.’ No one else is going to sort this out for us. And if we make the wrong choices, when we could have made the right ones, the rest of life is unlikely to be concerned about our fate.  The poet William Carlos Williams crushingly dismissed the fall of Icarus – as depicted in a painting by Breughel which showed the rest of life continuing regardless – as ‘a splash quite unnoticed.’"
"Attempts to strike a bipartisan deal on the renewable energy target have collapsed, throwing a central climate policy into confusion as the government prepares to welcome world leaders to the G20 summit on the weekend. Labor’s environment spokesman, Mark Butler, wrote to the industry minister, Ian Macfarlane, on Tuesday saying his party could not accept the “deep and devastating cut to the sector” being proposed by the government and didn’t see “any value in continuing discussions at this point in the time.”  With Macfarlane overseas, the timing of the letter appears partly designed to embarrass the government ahead of the G20, but it is also an indication that the ALP considers the gap between its negotiating position and that of the Coalition to be too big to overcome. The policy currently requires that 41,000 gigawatt hours of energy come from renewables by 2020. Labor and the renewables industry rejected out of hand the government’s opening gambit in the talks – to reduce the target to about 26,000 gigawatts – saying it would decimate the industry. It is understood Labor indicated it would negotiate around a target in the mid to high 30,000 gigawatt hours, but this was unacceptable to the government. The government is already under pressure from US and European negotiators to give climate change a higher profile at the G20 meeting, to help momentum towards an ambitious agreement for post-2020 emissions reduction targets at the United Nations summit in Paris at the end of next year. And the EU has already agreed to cut carbon emissions by “at least 40%” by 2030 based on 1990 levels with “at least” 27% of energy sourced from renewable sources by 2030. Labor’s walkout from the talks sets up a high stakes stand-off. Without a renewable energy target, Australia’s new Direct Action climate policy will have little chance of meeting even the minimum target of a 5% cut in emissions by 2020, according to modelling firm Reputex. But investment in renewables will also grind to a halt and existing investments will come under pressure as the value of the market created by the RET remains unviably low. In his letter Butler says “Labor will not stand by and watch billions of dollars of investment in the Australian renewable energy sector – along with thousands of jobs – go overseas because of deep cuts in the target.” And he says that since the abolition of the carbon tax, “the importance of a strong RET cannot be overstated”. But research released by the Climate Council this week showed investment in the RET had already fallen by 70% since 2013 because of uncertainty surrounding its future. The government had originally signaled it wanted even deeper cuts to the target – which was intended to deliver 20% renewables by 2020 but due to declining energy demand will now deliver more like 27%. It commissioned businessman and self-professed climate sceptic Dick Warburton to undertake a review. Its main recommendation was for the target to be slashed to about 16,000 gigawatt hours. But after fierce resistance from industry and concerted criticism of that review, the federal cabinet asked the environment minister, Greg Hunt, and the industry minister, Ian Macfarlane, to try to reach a bipartisan agreement about the future of the program that would allow continued investment without fear of policy change. Macfarlane said the government wanted a target representing a “real” 20% of the current energy market – probably about 26,000 gigawatt hours – with no change to the subsidies for household rooftop solar panels and a full exemption from the scheme for all energy-intensive industries, such as aluminium, copper, zinc and cement."
"The Weather Channel co-founder John Coleman was recently interviewed by Megyn Kelly on Fox News, calling human-caused global warming “a myth.” The interview was then amplified through the media echo chamber, including an article at left-leaning Huffington Post, and Coleman was subsequently interviewed on CNN’s Reliable Sources. Coleman has publicly denied the scientific reality of human-caused global warming for years, telling Fox News in 2008 that he wanted to sue Al Gore, for example. There’s no new content in these latest interviews; just the usual long-debunked climate myths and conspiracy theories. Coleman is apparently considered a credible climate interviewee because he was instrumental in creating The Weather Channel 32 years ago, but he’s woefully misinformed when it comes to climate science.  In his Fox News interview, Coleman said,  The Antarctic ice cap is at an all-time record high in both coverage and thickness, and the Arctic ice cap at the North Pole is at the highest it has been in several years. It’s in its so-called normal range since we got satellite observations that can measure it. So not only is the ice not melting, more polar bears are alive and happy today than in 100 years. Each of these points is either wrong or misleading. Although more Arctic sea ice survived this year than in the record-shattering melt of 2012, in 2014 the ice was nevertheless at its 6th-lowest level in thousands of years. About 70% of the sea ice in the Arctic has disappeared over the past three decades, mainly due to human-caused global warming. This rapid decline is well outside “the normal range” of Arctic sea ice extent and volume.  The Arctic has lost 10 times more sea ice than the Antarctic has gained, and resent research suggests the collapse of the land-based Antarctic ice sheet may already be inevitable. Of the 12 polar bear populations for which we have sufficient observational data, 8 are declining and just 1 is increasing. There’s a myth that polar bear populations are thriving because they’ve grown since the 1970s. That growth has nothing to do with the climate – it was due to the introduction of the International Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears in 1973, which restricted and in some circumstances banned the hunting of polar bears, which had caused their populations to dwindle. Global warming – specifically the rapid decline in the Arctic sea ice they need to hunt – has caused polar bear populations to decline in recent years. Well there are 9,000 Ph.D.’s and 31 [thousand] scientists who have signed a petition that says that [carbon dioxide] is not a significant greenhouse gas On both Fox and CNN Coleman referred to the discredited Oregon Petition, which can be signed by anyone with just about any college science degree, and which has included “signatures” from fictional characters and Spice Girls. In reality, 97% of climate science experts and their peer-reviewed research agree that human carbon dioxide emissions are driving global warming. On CNN (which to its credit, established before the interview that there is a 97% expert consensus on human-caused global warming and there aren’t two equal sides in this ‘debate’), Coleman went even further in denying basic science, saying, Climate change is not happening. There is no significant man-made global warming now, there hasn’t been any in the past, and there’s no reason to expect any in the future. There’s a whole lot of baloney ... there is no global warming. That’s just a denial of reality. Several times during the Fox interview, Megyn Kelly commented that The Weather Channel will “be pushed out of existence since [Coleman has] taken this position.” In reality, Coleman was forced out of The Weather Channel in 1983, just a year after he helped found it. Coleman has had no affiliation with The Weather Channel for over 30 years. The Weather Channel has an official statement on climate change, which it updated a few days after the Coleman interview. It states, More than a century’s worth of detailed climate observations shows a sharp increase in both carbon dioxide and temperature. These observations, together with computer model simulations and historical climate reconstructions from ice cores, ocean sediments and tree rings all provide strong evidence that the majority of the warming over the past century is a result of human activities. This is also the conclusion drawn, nearly unanimously, by climate scientists. On CNN, The Weather Channel CEO David Kenny said, I’m concerned whenever the discussion of climate change veers from the science. The science is really clear, and I don’t like our brand being associated with something that’s not scientifically based. I think we can all be proud of our résumés, but I would prefer people use the credentials they have today, not the credentials of three decades ago. On CNN, Coleman claimed to be a scientist. He’s been a TV weatherman for over 60 years, but his degree is in journalism. In recent years he forecasted the weather in San Diego, where it generally ranges from sunny and warm to sunnier and warmer. The Weather Channel, on the other hand, employs meteorologists with climate science training. For example, Heidi Cullen was The Weather Channel’s first on-air climate expert. Cullen received a Ph.D. in climatology and ocean-atmosphere dynamics at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University and has worked as a research scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research and Columbia University’s International Research Institute for Climate and Society. On the subject of climate change, Cullen has said, There is convincing evidence that since the industrial revolution, human activities, resulting in increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases and other trace constituents in the atmosphere, have become a major agent of climate change ... If a meteorologist has an AMS Seal of Approval, which is used to confer legitimacy to TV meteorologists, then meteorologists have a responsibility to truly educate themselves on the science of global warming. Those comments certainly apply to John Coleman. Coleman has previously gone as far as to suggest that climate science is part of a conspiracy to create a one-world government. On CNN, he claimed, The government puts out about $2.5m directly for climate research every year. It only gives that money to scientists who will produce scientific results that support the global warming hypothesis of the Democratic Party, or the position. So, they don’t have any choice. If you’re gonna get the money, you’ve gotta support their position. Therefore, 97% of the scientific reports publish support global warming. This is conspiratorial nonsense. Grants are awarded before research is performed and before its conclusions are known. The 3% of contrarian climate scientists like Roy Spencer and Richard Lindzen have received millions of dollars in government research grants. CNN host Brian Stelter even went as far as to specifically ask Coleman, “Is The Weather Channel part of the conspiracy?”. Coleman responded, Well, The Weather Channel has bought into it. As I say, they’ve drunk the Kool-Aid. It’s ironic that on CNN’s Reliable Sources, Coleman revealed that on climate change, he’s a completely unreliable source with no expertise or credibility on the subject, preferring conspiracy theories to science."

"Just this week, a new study has appeared which describes a clever method for measuring the flows of ocean currents and their impacts on ice shelves. This study has identified a major mechanism for melting ice in the Southern Hemisphere. The paper, co-authored by Andrew Thompson, Karen Heywood, and colleagues is very novel. The scientists used sea gliders to identify water flows that bring warm waters to the base of ice shelves in Antarctica. As I’ve written before, ocean currents are complex; you cannot neglect their impact on the Earth’s climate.   In some parts of the ocean, dense waters near the surface fall to the ocean floor and spread across the globe. In other regions, waters from the deep rise to the surface. Similarly, waters move horizontally and carry their heat with them. In some cases the surface waters and the mid-depth waters flow in different directions.  But regardless of the direction of flow, these waters carry energy with them. This process, often called “advection,” results in a major redistribution of heat across the globe. Sometimes, warm waters flow into cold regions, transferring heat, and melting ice. It is this phenomenon that was at the center of the current paper. Fluids sometimes move as large directional masses (sometimes called bulk motion) caused by some agent of motion, for instance winds that blow over the surface and drag waters. Other motions are characterized by swirls and eddies – not unidirectional flow. This type of motions is called eddy-induced transport. A determination of which type of transport dominates and where they dominate is important to understanding Antarctic ice melt. The Caltech and UEA scientists used sea gliders to make their measurements. Sea gliders are devices that move up and down in the ocean waters, taking samples of water properties, while they glide. Sea gliders are a relatively new measurement tool and they provide high-resolution, high-quality data.  Three such gliders were deployed in the Weddell Sea in early 2012. Together, the gliders made 750 dives to depths of 1000 meters or to within 20 meters of the sea floor. They completed their dives every four hours, making measurements of temperature, salinity, oxygen levels, and optical properties every five seconds. The data was then transmitted wirelessly to a data collection station. The data showed that eddy-transport and surface-wind-caused motion are comparable in their contribution to water circulation. They showed however, that the eddy motion is largely confined to the warm intermediate water layers. The penetration of the warm waters to the ice shelves is believed to be responsible for the dramatic ice loss that has been observed in the Antarctic. I asked Dr. Heywood about her research and she told me,  It helps us know how the heat gets to the continental shelf – something that is not well understood at present. Imagine that you have a swimming pool with a deep end and a shallow end. There is a lot of warm water in the deep end (this is the Southern Ocean). In the shallow end, there is a wall of ice (this represents Antarctica). How do you get the warm water from the deep end to the shallow end to melt the ice? One way is to stir the water so that little eddies and swirls take the warm water and push it into the shallow water so it contacts the ice. This is the process we were able to observe and quantify for the first time using our glider data at the edge of Antarctica. The next step will be to incorporate this process into climate models so that scientists and policy makers can get a better idea of how much the ice might melt in the future. I asked her how they came up with this novel sea-glider concept. She responded,  Back in 2007, Andy Thompson was working with us on a research project to understand ocean currents at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. In those days, we could only make measurements from ships, stopping every few kilometers. We made these measurements as close together as we could for two weeks. But then we thought that what was really needed was a high-resolution observing tool because the ocean changes over really short distances – sometimes a kilometer or less. So, in 2012, we were able to return with our sea gliders. They are autonomous underwater vehicles that move up and down in the ocean and send their measurements of temperature and saltiness back by satellite. We realized that we could demonstrate the important role that these eddies have played transporting heat towards Antarctica. In 2013, I was one author among many on a major oceanography paper that extolled the need for instruments like the sea gliders. It is great to see these devices in action – gathering information that was not previously available. Melting from below is a major issue in Antarctica. I have a paper in press with Dr. Ted Scambos that identifies the potential for rapid sea level rise based on Antarctic melting. I hope to share our findings with you in the next few weeks."
"Clive Palmer does not believe the Coalition’s $2.5bn Direct Action plan can deliver Australia’s minimum 5% greenhouse gas reduction target but says his senators voted for it last week because it was “better than having nothing”. “It’s clear Direct Action won’t give us the 5% reductions,” Palmer told Guardian Australia. “We’re going to need another policy pretty soon. But in the short-term it’s better to have something reducing emissions than having nothing.”  Palmer, whose senators also voted to repeal the former government’s emissions trading scheme – which is how Australia was left without a climate policy – said he believed Australia would eventually have to move to such a scheme. As part of a deal to secure PUP’s votes in the Direct Action vote last week, the government has agreed to commission the Climate Change Authority to inquire into an emissions trading scheme – something Palmer says will “keep the debate alive until the next election”. The government insists its new scheme might even exceed its 5% target. The environment minister, Greg Hunt, confirmed he would begin doling out the money – allocated via competitive “auctions” – early next year and said there was strong interest from businesses and other groups that wanted to participate. “The level of interest and pipeline of projects have been greater than expected,” he said, insisting the government would achieve the 5% target within its budget. The prime minister, Tony Abbott, has made it clear no more money will be allocated. Elisa de Wit, a climate change lawyer and partner at Norton Rose Fulbright, said the early recipients of Direct Action money were likely to be in areas that were already developing a set of rules under the existing carbon farming scheme – including projects to capture and either flare or use gas from landfill and waste plants, projects to avoid deforestation, and projects to capture gas from coal mines.  Hunt said the government was “developing methodologies which will be released shortly. There are 26 out there, another more than 20 under development for things such as aggregated household energy efficiency, for cleaning up power stations, for cleaning up waste coal mine gas, for cleaning up emissions from waste water and sewerage farms.” Labor’s environment spokesman, Mark Butler, predicted Direct Action would be a waste of money. “Tony Abbott and Greg Hunt stand up, put their hands on their hearts and say `We are going to achieve the 5% reduction’,” he told the ABC’s Insiders. “No one else believes it. No one else has said we have a chance under this policy to achieve a 5% reduction, let alone the more ambitious discussions that will be the subject at international negotiations next year.” But the government’s chances of meeting the target are bolstered by the big reduction in Australia’s emissions before Direct Action has even started, in part due to the decline in manufacturing. In 2012 the Coalition’s promise to reduce emissions by 5% of 2000 levels by 2020 was calculated to require the cumulative reduction of 755m tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Last year new government calculations reduced that figure to 431m tonnes. Further calculations by Frontier Economics say the figure could be as low as 225m tonnes if the renewable energy target (RET) stays in place to drive investment into clean generation, or somewhere around 300m tonnes if the government succeeds in paring back the RET. Official figures are soon likely to confirm this drop."

"Using Direct Action to achieve an Australian greenhouse gas reduction target for 2025 which would match new US promises could cost as much as $30bn, The Climate Institute think tank has calculated. The Abbott government has welcomed the surprise announcement by the world’s two biggest greenhouse emitters – China and the US – of new targets to reduce emissions after 2020.   The environment minister, Greg Hunt, said Australia would announce its post-2020 target in the first half of next year, ahead of the United Nations conference in December where it is hoped an international climate deal will be clinched. Hunt said Australia’s existing target to reduce emissions by 5% by 2020 was very close to the emissions reduction the US would achieve by that date, but neither he nor the treasurer, Joe Hockey, would say whether the new US post-2025 target would also be a benchmark for Australia’s longer-term pledge. Obama has promised to cut US emissions by between 26% and 28% by 2025, compared with 2005 levels. Australia measures emissions cuts against 2000 levels, and calculated in that way an equivalent 2025 target for Australia would be around 30%. Calculating the cuts necessary to achieve that target from Australia’s current emissions trajectory, The Climate Institute says it would cost $9bn in 2025 to buy the necessary abatement at a very low $8 to $9 a tonne, or $30bn if carbon abatement costs closer to $30 a tonne in 2025, as projected by Treasury. The current $2.5bn emissions reduction fund is designed only to meet the 2020 target, which is set to become an easier objective because Australia’s emissions have fallen with the closure of heavy industry and the rapid take-up of rooftop solar and other renewables. Hunt said Australia was “currently reviewing” its post-2020 climate policy. The government has not said how the post-2020 target will be set or whether it will draw on the advice of the expert Climate Change Authority, which it has so far been unable to abolish.  It is understood officials from the departments of foreign affairs and environment are working on policy options. But according to the Climate Institute chief executive, John Connor, an emissions reduction fund on its own is not going to be able to reach a deeper target. He says the government would need to vary its policy in ways it has so far ruled out – including setting tough “safeguards” to effectively create a baseline and credit emissions trading scheme for industry, or allowing the purchase of less expensive international carbon credits. “Plainly, the ERF by itself does not add up to credible climate policy. It needs to be replaced or significantly boosted with policies that put the responsibility back on the polluter. This means adding super strong safeguard measures and regulatory limits on major emitters and access to international markets,” Connor said. The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, announced his country’s emissions would “peak” in 2030 at the latest. Hunt said this was “a very important thing” but meant Chinese emissions would continue to grow significantly for many years. According to the Climate Analytics Climate Action Tracker, Chinese emissions are now around 10 gigatonnes a year and could reach 15 to 16 gigatonnes in 2020. China has not said at what level it expects emissions to peak.  Hunt pointed out that even a peak at around 13 or 14 gigatonnes would still mean substantial continued rises in emissions. The Minerals Council of Australia’s chief executive, Brendan Pearson, said the China/US announcement was good news for Australian coal and uranium exports. “The target of China’s efforts will be to reduce the use of low-quality coal in boilers in buildings and small manufacturing and shift the emphasis to modern, highly efficient centralised supercritical coal-fired power generation. That will require high-quality coal, which Australia is well-placed to supply,” he said. Frank Jotzo, the director of the centre for climate economics and policy at the Australian National University’s Crawford School, said China’s coal use will start to decline in absolute terms “relatively soon” as will its reliance on coal imports. But he said China was looking for higher-quality coal and some Australian producers may be well placed to supply it."
"Guardian Australia revealed on Thursday that Victoria’s four peak environment groups had released a joint statement claiming the Coalition government’s record was the worst the groups had ever seen, amounting to a “wholesale attack on the state’s environmental assets”. So what is the record? Here, we look at the key decisions and policies of the Baillieu/Napthine government on the environment.  Environment and climate change minister Ryan Smith declined to be interviewed for this story. In an email, he said the government had invested more than $3.1bn in the environment and was “committed to taking practical action to protect and enhance our environment, which delivers tangible results and best value for money”. “This includes acknowledging the challenges posed by a changing climate. The Coalition has invested $50m targeted specifically to help Victorian’s adapt to climate change. “Victoria was the first state to release its climate change adaptation plan, which is a comprehensive strategy to help minimise the costs of any potential risks and take advantage of any opportunities that could arise out of changes in our climate. “The Greens and Labor are again out of touch, they show a lack of understanding on what the Victorian Coalition has invested in and achieved for Victorians on environmental matters.”  There is only one minister for climate change in the country – Ryan Smith, Victoria’s environment and climate change minister. The title implies that the Coalition government has an interest in the issue, even in an era of mixed messages from Canberra about how urgent it is. Yet Smith mentioned climate change not once in parliament this year. His website reveals no speeches or statements on climate change in 2014. Nor has he released a single media release on that part of his portfolio this year. What the government did when it was elected was to scrap the Brumby Labor government’s legislated target to cut the state’s greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020. The target was set after the failure of the Rudd’s government’s carbon trading scheme to pass the Senate. Victoria was the first state to have such a goal. At the time, the Liberal party voted for it and promised at the 2010 election to keep it. After the election, it was described as “aspirational” only, and the target was dropped entirely in 2012. The government’s argument was that because the Gillard government had by then put in place a carbon price to achieve a national emissions reduction goal, there was no need for states to have their own. Victoria could be disadvantaged compared with other states if it did. As Environment Victoria’s CEO Mark Wakeham points out, Victoria’s target wasn’t one with penalties, but more a statement of intent about the state’s direction, a benchmark to refer to when making decisions such as planning and infrastructure decisions. The broader question is whether the government has any real commitment to climate change action, despite the minister’s title. In 2008, then opposition leader Ted Baillieu told parliament “’We support an emission capping and trading scheme as the least costly way of responding to global warming.’’ Along with the federal party, that support is gone in Victoria. The Coalition inherited Labor-appointed commissioner for environmental sustainability, Professor Kate Auty, who quit the job earlier this year, saying the government had discouraged bureaucrats from even using the term “climate change” – a claim the government denies. Auty’s main job was to produce a report on the State of the Environment. Climate change is global, but its impact is local, and Auty outlined the evidence that Victoria would see an average rise in temperature by 2030 of between 0.6 degrees and 1.2 degrees since 1990 and as high as 3.8 degrees by 2070. There would be less rainfall, and more intense and frequent bushfires and heatwaves. Melbourne had nine days over 35 degrees in 1990. That’s likely to be as high as 26 by 2070. Auty told Guardian Australia that the government inherited an “extraordinary superstructure” of programs in biodiversity, coastal management, climate change adaptation and mitigation. Even little things, such as increasing the number of hybrid vehicles in the government fleet, reducing water use, and better lighting were under way. Auty believes that when then prime minister Julia Gillard was under sustained attack over the introduction of a carbon tax, the conservative states were encouraged to pull back, to “not give an ounce of oxygen” on climate change. Any state momentum was lost, and the Victorian government alleged dire consequences to the state economy if a carbon tax were introduced. “It’s been an exercise in dismantlement and dismissiveness and ideology and … to a certain extent just bastardry,” Auty said. The government last year released a climate action adaption plan, a commitment inherited from the Brumby government. It was praised for its approach of partnering with local governments to adapt to the big changes underway, but criticised for offering just $6m to deal with them. Labor has so far promised only to review the need for Victoria to again set a target, but shadow environment and climate change minister Lisa Neville insists states do have a role in both reducing emissions and adapting, “even more so now that we have a federal government that is really walking away from serious action when it come to climate change.”. Greens leader Greg Barber says neither major party is whole-hearted because “things are getting serious and they’d have to actually do something which would mean an economic transition”. Neville acknowledges that state elections are dominated by education, health, jobs and transport, but she says the environment does shift some votes and “people expect their government to be protecting national parks, protecting the coastlines, even if it mightn’t be their number one issue”. No environmental decision has been more controversial than to allow up to 99-year leases for large-scale commercial developments in up to two thirds of the state’s national parks. Until then, commercial operations were banned in Victoria apart from small-scale operations such as camping grounds and kiosks. Private development in national parks was not promised at the last election, but Ryan said at the time that it brought Victoria into line with all others states and territories except the ACT. It was needed to attract more tourists, particularly from China and there would be exclusion zones for particularly sensitive areas. The government believes eco-tourism is compatible with the protection of national parks. A few days before the caretaker period began, the government quietly signed off the first lease under the new laws – a 50-year lease for a luxury hot spring resort, 108-room hotel and conference centre at the Point Nepean national park on the tip of the Mornington Peninsula. “We’re not against commercial use of parks,” says Matt Ruchel, executive director of the Victorian National Parks Association. “There are already hundreds of leases and licences, mostly short term, but 99 years is as good as private ownership in our view.” There are old quarantine buildings at Point Nepean and “there needs to be some commercial use of it, but no one expected the whole 64 ha of the site to be sliced off for a giant spa resort.” Ruchel says Victoria’s laws open up national parks to private development more than other states. He argues it is preferable to locate big developments adjacent to national parks, not inside them. NSW allows one 99-year lease, for the private ski resorts at Kosciuszko national park. The Victorian government has cited the Southern Ocean Lodge resort at Kangaroo Island in South Australia as an example of what can be done, but that facility is just outside the national parks. Cradle Mountain Lodge in Tasmania is also outside the national park. But there is growing pressure in all states for greater tourist development within national parks. Apart from Victoria, only Tasmania allows 99-year private leases, all but transferring ownership according to critics. And Ruchel says that the fact that so much of the state’s national parks will be potentially available for development is unprecedented. The CEO of the National Parks Association of NSW, Kevin Evans, said there were no similar proposals for developments of spa resorts and hotels in that state. “No, there would be warfare about using our national areas for that purpose,” he said. The Victorian government has no plans for new national parks in the state, while Labor is under pressure to declare the Great Forest National Park in the state’s central highlands, in part to protect the endangered Leadbeater’s possum. Labor would also remove cattle grazing in the Alpine National Park, which the Coalition allowed after the election. The political focus is on the Federal government’s intention to water down the renewable energy target (RET), a once bipartisan policy for Australia to meet 20% of its energy needs through clean sources by 2020. It would mean the installation of of 41,000 gigawatt hours of renewable energy would be reduced to around 26,000 gigawatts, a cut Labor says is unacceptable. The uncertainty in the renewable industry is already causing pain – last month, Victorian wind turbine giant Keppel Prince announced 100 job cuts, blaming the lack of clarity in the federal government’s commitment to renewable energy. As it happens, the business is in premier Denis Napthine’s electorate. What role should states play in reducing reliance on fossil fuels in favour of clean energy? Victoria had the country’s first state renewable energy target in 2006, a reaction to the Howard government’s decision not to extend the then mandatory renewable energy target. In some circles, Victoria’s move all-but saved the renewable industry in this country. The aim then was to have clean energy provide 10% of Victoria’s needs. “If not us, who? If not now, when?” then environment minister John Thwaites told parliament at the time. “Today is the day for Victoria to assume its rightful place in leading the nation towards a sustainable energy future.” Some environment groups argue that state schemes are a distraction from the main game in Canberra. Others say state schemes can at least set ambitious, if not mandatory, targets and provide a framework to encourage investment of renewable businesses. The ACT, which has a 90% statutory target, says the real work may have to be done by the states if the federal government succeeds in lowering the national scheme. In the US, more than half of all states have their own renewable energy targets. South Australia has been the most ambitious here, recently announcing it would target to 50% by 2025, up from 33% target that has already been met. It’s not a mandatory target, but the state has managed to attract almost half of all large-scale renewable energy investment in the country. NSW has no official target beyond the national one, but is sensing the business opportunities. Its environment minister Rob Stokes in July announced an ambitious policy on renewable energy. “We can make NSW number one for clean energy and climate change mitigation … we can be Australia’s answer to California,” he said. Napthine himself this week tweeted: “Disappointed RET negotiations stalled. Time to redouble efforts for positive RET outcome – crucial for alternative energy industries.” He has said that the government has provided support for solar, geothermal, wave and wind industries. But environment groups argue the state is missing out because of the government’s lack of real commitment. Victoria gets about 12% of its energy from renewables. In its submission to the RET review, Victoria supported the Abbott government’s argument that a “real” 20% target would mean a substantial cut. It also offered the novel suggestion that the RET should include gas-fired power, which is derived from fossil fuels. The City of Melbourne is ahead of the state government, setting a target to produce 25% of electricity from renewables by 2018 and opposing any change to the national RET. “To get renewable energy rolling out in Victoria we need to do two things, rip up the anti-wind farm laws, and institute a state renewable energy target,” says Leigh Ewbank, Friends of the Earth’s renewable energy spokesperson. Wind farms have become the lightning rod in Victoria and a clear policy difference between the parties. The state has the most restrictive regulations in the country (although NSW comes a close second), including the right for residents to veto a project if it comes within 2km of their homes. In other states, the restriction is around 1km, and there is no right of veto in Western Australia, South Australia or Queensland. The restrictions have brought the industry to a halt. Labor on Thursday announced it would reduce to 1km the right of residents to veto. It also pointed out that, since 2010, only two wind farm projects had been approved by the government – and neither were within the 2km zone. Politically, this is a big issue in regional Victoria, desperate for new industries and jobs. Labor’s wind farm policy changes will allow locals in Macedon ranges to establish a “community wind farm”, which has been blocked despite support from locals. Macedon is a marginal seat, and the restrictions have been a big issue as regional communities look for jobs and new industries. But Labor would keeping the veto right for residents for projects within 1km of their homes, and keeps the “no go” zones where no wind farms can be build. The Greens say it’s half-hearted reform, and that only normal noise restrictions should apply. Labor hasn’t said it supports a state renewable energy target but has announced a $20m fund to provide grants to high growth renewable industries. The government plans to abandon the Victoria’s key scheme to improve energy efficiency. The Victorian Energy Efficiency Target (Veet) started in in 2009 and, like a similar one in NSW, provides energy saving devices such as efficient light bulbs and power boards to households, mostly free. The target is to saving 5.4m tonnes of greenhouse emissions each year. Wakeham says that of all the government’s environment decisions, he was “most shocked when they wanted to cut the Veet because it had created 2000 jobs and it had delivered cost savings to hundred of households and business.” The scheme was due to finished in 2030. “The reason they gave for dismantling it was that had been affecting the profitability of existing generators. It was a program designed to reduce energy consumption; of course it was going to affect existing generators. “The fact that that was uppermost in their thinking shows the degree to which their policies were protecting vested interests rather than the public interest.” The government argued the scheme was no longer cost effective. It had helped participating households save more than $1000 from electricity bills to 2030, but it was cross-subsidised by those who didn’t participate. They would pay an extra $48 a year on their power bills to 2017. A spokesperson for the energy minister, Russell Northe, told the Age that the government “will not support a scheme that is cross-subsidised by the most disadvantaged”. Yet the government’s own review of the scheme concluded “relatively disadvantaged areas have received a greater share of certificates than more advantaged areas”. When announcing the decision, the government did say it would initiate other schemes, but has not said what as yet. Labor has promised to keep the scheme if elected. When the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its most recent report warning that fossil fuels needed to be phased out by the end of the century while renewable energy must make up 80% of production by 2050, Napthine was asked if he agreed. More than 90% of Victoria’s energy needs come from brown coal, which is more polluting than black coal and gas. Napthine spoke supportively of the industry, saying it “provides us cheap, affordable energy for Victorian families and Victorian businesses. It’s vital for the cost of living for families, vital for our competitive industries.” He also said the government was “strongly supportive” of renewable energy. One of the first actions of the Coalition government when it was elected was to cease talks with the Hazelwood power station – the dirtiest in the country – to begin a phased shutdown, saying it would be too expensive. The previous Labor government when it set its emissions reduction target said closing part of the power station was “the most cost effective way” to clean up the state’s environment. But it relied on federal money to pay compensation to Hazelwood and in 2012, the Gillard government abandoned talks, saying the compensation being sought was too high. The IPPC’s warnings are dismissed or ignored because states are so reliant on coal for their energy needs. The government doesn’t want to phase out coal mining, it wants to expand it – and there is no evidence that Labor will have a different view. In 2012, the then Baillieu government called for expressions of interest to extract 13 billion tonnes of brown coal. The Age reported last month that new licences could be issued soon after the election – which ever party forms government. So far, coal has been used for domestic purposes in Victoria, but the government wants to develop it and export it. This year it granted $75m for three new coal projects. Barber says the state is captured in its environment policy by fossil fuel companies. “Really, they’ve got a lot to lose, and why wouldn’t they devote an increasing proportion of their profits to lobbying efforts and propaganda efforts to stay on the wicket they’re on?” At this election, key issues such as the future development of new coal reserves are not being discussed. Neville would only say: “On coal, we absolutely have to rebuild our renewable energy market, we need to increase the share of renewable energy in order to prioritise the phasing out of brown coal and fossil fuels.” Similarly, there is official silence on whether Victoria develops a coal seam gas (CSG) industry. More than 30 communities across the state have declared themselves “gasfield free” and want the major parties to declare their position before the vote. The government has put a moratorium on unconventional gas until mid next year while it conducts consultations, and will not state its position beforehand. Labor has said it will launch an inquiry into unconventional gas if it wins the election, but will also give no commitment before November 29. The Greens oppose CSG mining and hope to win their first upper house seat outside Melbourne campaigning on the issue."
"Pressure from Europe and the United States for G20 leaders to make strong commitments on climate change despite the objections of the host nation Australia has continued to the last minute and has to some extent succeeded. But the Green Climate Fund – to which the US is poised to announce a significant $3bn contribution – remains a tensely-debated sticking point.  As revealed by the Guardian on Friday, president Barack Obama will make a substantial pledge to the fund to help poor countries fight climate change while in Brisbane, again putting the US at odds with Australia, which has argued against diplomatic efforts for G20 leaders to promise more contributions and has been reluctant to make contributions of its own. It is understood a reference to “encouraging” countries to contribute to the fund remains “in brackets” in the draft final communique – meaning it has not yet been agreed – with the principal objections coming from Australia.  It is understood the prime minister, Tony Abbott, and his advisers will have to decide whether to allow the language to proceed in the consensus-driven G20 process. But as Guardian Australia revealed a week ago, the text that had at that stage made it through the G20’s closed-door process was very general, and made no mention of the fund. It reads as follows: “We support strong and effective action to address climate change, consistent with sustainable economic growth and certainty for business and investment.  “We reaffirm our resolve to adopt a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change that is applicable to all parties at the 21st Conference of the Parties in Paris in 2015.” Since that time it is understood the communique has also been strengthened to call on countries to unveil their post 2020 climate commitments early next year. Abbott had previously insisted Australia would not make any contributions to the green climate fund, although it is understood the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which leads Australia’s negotiating position in international climate talks, has been considering whether Canberra should make a pledge. Sources said no final decision had been made. Asked about the fund before last year’s UN climate meeting in Warsaw, the prime minister said: “We’re not going to be making any contributions to that.” It was reported that at one of its first cabinet meetings the Abbott government decided it would make no contributions to the fund. Australia has also come under intense pressure to announce a target for post-2020 greenhouse gas reductions after the shock announcement from Obama and Chinese premier Xi Jinping of new national climate change goals. The US has agreed to cut its emissions by 26% to 28% of 2005 levels by 2025 – a doubling of the pace of its reductions. If Australia were to make similar cuts by 2025 against its 2000 benchmark, it would need to reduce emissions by between 28% and 31%. Asked where the deal left Australia’s climate change policy, the expert adviser to the former government Professor Ross Garnaut said: “Exactly where it was before the US-China announcement – up shit creek.” Abbott has said he welcomed the announcement, but Australia was focused on taking “immediate action” through its “direct action” emissions reduction fund. The environment minister, Greg Hunt, said Australia would announce a post-2020 target early next year, well in time for the UN conference in Paris where it is hoped a post-2020 deal will be agreed. Australia has insisted the G20 is not the right place to discuss climate change, because it is an economic forum. This stance was backed by the Canadian prime minister, Stephen Harper, but not by the Turkish prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, whose country will host the next G20 meeting, and who said on Friday that focusing only on economic growth was shortsighted. “The biggest challenge to all humanity today is climate change … every year we are facing new challenges and we are facing new challenges and we need to address this future of ours. If the G20 agenda is only limited to financial issues, G20 cannot function, cannot have global legitimacy,” he said. UN secretary general Ban Ki Moon said he had been briefed that the leaders were “actively discussing the issue of a climate change”, which he nominated as “the defining issue of our times” and therefore a “natural” topic of G20 discussion. He called on the G20 to “take a lead” on climate and urged G20 countries to make “ambitious pledges” to the green climate fund. Introducing the “retreat” at the start of the G20 meeting, Abbott told the world leaders he would prefer the discussion to focus on “the politics of economic reform” but “in the end, though, this is your retreat, it is open to any of you to raise any subject that you wish”."
"More than a third of the planet’s natural world heritage sites face significant threats such as invasive species, logging and poaching, and climate change is a looming menace to prized ecosystems, according to a major new assessment. The first ever analysis of all 228 natural world heritage sites found that 21% have a good conservation outlook, with 42% deemed to be “good with some concerns”.  However, 29% have “significant concerns” and a further 8% are listed as “critical”, which means they are deemed to be “severely threatened” and require urgent attention to avoid their natural value being lost. The IUCN World Heritage Outlook, released at the World Parks Congress in Sydney, found that 54% of world heritage sites are well managed, but 13% are seriously deficient in protecting species and landscapes. The report cites invasive species, the impact of tourism, poaching, dams and logging as the most pressing threats, although climate change may soon eclipse all of these factors. “In terms of current threats, the most pressing is invasive species but climate change is the most serious potential threat,” said Elena Osipova, world heritage monitoring officer at the IUCN. “We’ve already seen the impact of climate change and the problem is that climate change can increase the impact from other threats.” Most of the 19 critically threatened world heritage sites are in Africa, including the Virunga national park, which contains around half of the world’s remaining mountain gorillas. The Everglades national park in Florida is also on the critical list, mainly due to the area’s declining water quality, introduced pest species and vulnerability to climate change.  Three key Australian sites are listed as being a significant concern – the Great Barrier Reef, Kakadu and Queensland’s wet tropics. The declining state of the Great Barrier Reef has become a contentious political issue in Australia, with the government agreeing to a Unesco plea to stop dumping sediment in the ecosystem’s waters. Machu Picchu in Peru, Tanzania’s Serengeti and the Sundarbans national park in India, home to an endangered population of tigers, are also considered to be of significant concern. The best-ranked world heritage sites, with few threats, include Australia’s Lord Howe island, Mount Etna in Italy and the Dorset and east Devon coast in the UK. Cyril Kormos, vice chair of the IUCN world commission on protected areas, said the assessment wasn’t intended to be political but should help countries manage world heritage sites better. “This is something we all need to ensure the success of,” he said. “If we fail to protect the most valuable, iconic protected areas on the planet, we fail as a conservation community. “ A separate report unveiled at the World Parks Congress, a once-a-decade conservation event organised by the IUCN, found that the world is broadly on track to meet targets on the expansion of protected areas. The United Nations Environment Program’s Protected Planet report found that 15.4% of the planet’s land and inland water areas and 3.4% of oceans are now formally protected. A total of 6.1m square kilometres has been placed under protection since 2010 – an area almost the size of Australia. Targets agreed by more than 190 countries state that at least 17% of the world’s terrestrial areas and 10% of its oceans must be protected by 2020. The report states that while this target is likely to be met, other problems present themselves. Specifically, many protected areas are poorly managed, aren’t located in areas of important biodiversity and aren’t well connected, which means animals and plants can’t spread and flourish. Conservation officials at the congress also pointed out that the 17% target was essentially a political one, with scientists advocating up to 50% of the world’s surface to be protected in order to save threatened species and safeguard critical habitat that provides water. Achim Steiner, executive director of UNEP, said there needed to be a greater appreciation of the economic benefits of protected areas, citing a Finnish study that found that for every euro invested in nature, the community benefited by 10 euros. “We look at these things as a cost to the taxpayer, without looking at the multiplier in the economy,” he said. “The dividing line between private and public funding is very anachronistic. Most of the forests in Europe are under private ownership, for example. “The private sector is not just multinational mining enterprises; some can be important co-investors. They are an under-utilised and under-appreciated contributor to how to finance protected areas in the future.”"
"   Australia has focused firmly on financial regulation and increasing growth for the G20 summit in Brisbane that opens on Saturday. Although discussions are likely to be dominated by Ebola, Isis and Ukraine, development and anti-corruption feature high on its agenda. The G20 is not a decision-making body on many global issues, yet it can still send a strong message that helps unlock international processes. What can the development community hope to see reflected in the communique, the official post-summit report? The Australian presidency is committed to focus on 2% GDP growth over the next five years as the gold standard. But economic growth doesn’t necessarily result in jobs and improved livelihoods for the most vulnerable groups. Zambia, for example, has had 6% GDP growth rate for the past 10 years, yet job creation is stuck at 1%.  Much current growth is not sustainable because it contributes to climate change and can have negative impacts on the environment, in terms of pollution and increased pressure on scarce resources, as demonstrated by Cafod’s partner in Peru.  With high levels of poverty and inequality in many G20 countries, as well as environmental impacts that affect people’s livelihoods, in Brisbane the focus needs to be on growth that is inclusive and sustainable. So far the Australian presidency has resisted pressure from the US and Europe to include climate change in the G20 agenda on the grounds that it doesn’t fit the economic focus of the summit – although it has been part of the discussions on energy and infrastructure. Climate change is unlikely to have much space in the communique, but as a minimum we would expect leaders to recommit themselves to reaching a global deal to limit global warming at the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change meeting in Paris next year, as well as to contribute the finance. Each year, the G20 boldly recommits to phasing out fossil fuel subsidies, yet each year no concrete action appears to have been taken. With the global political context having changed, however, since Ban Ki-moon’s climate summit in September, leaders must develop a plan through the energy sustainability working group – a step backwards would send all the wrong signals to other international processes. Issues of beneficial ownership, automatic exchange of tax information and transparency in extractive industry payments have all been part of the G20 anti-corruption working group. They have also gained a higher profile through other forums such as the G8 in Lough Erne in 2013 and the Open Government Partnership, showing how international processes can be complementary.  If G20 commitments are to benefit developing countries, we expect to see an agreement on creating national registers of beneficial owners of companies, as well as a reaffirmation and action on past commitments to reach a global standard on extractive industry payment transparency. And beyond this G20? As Turkey takes over the presidency for such a crucial year ahead, we hope to see a commitment to positive engagement from all G20 countries to reach ambitious and transformative agreements on trade, development, climate and finance next year. Having already said its priority is to make the G20 agenda work for developing countries, 2015 is a great opportunity for Turkey to deliver. "
"In 2008 when the global economy was in crisis, the G20 stepped up. But in the six years since it has become better known for the protests it attracts than the progress it has made on its central goals of promoting growth and strengthening international economic institutions. So when the leaders meet again this weekend in Brisbane, Australia, they will be under pressure to achieve something tangible for the gathering to prove its relevance. But it is not at all clear that the “announceables” – the outcomes pre-negotiated by officials after a full year of meetings – will be sufficient to achieve that goal. Mike Callaghan, director of the G20 studies centre at the Lowy Institute thinktank in Sydney, said that while the first three G20 leaders’ summits in Washington, London and Pittsburgh helped coordinate fiscal and monetary stimulus and averted an even more severe economic crisis, the organisation now risked losing focus. With no secretariat, no treaty or legal instrument to back up its decisions and no power to force member nations to do anything, the G20’s effectiveness has to be measured by its capacity to influence member states. John Lipsky, a former first deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund, argued in a speech this year that “it is hard to say with certainty that any G20 member has altered its policy plans in the interest of achieving greater policy coherence – and therefore effectiveness – with its G20 partners”. He added that it was “felt widely that the agenda over time had become overburdened with worthy issues, but ones that were not within the direct purview of the G20, that tended to dilute the focus of the summits, and that didn’t lead to clear conclusions or actionable results”. The organisation’s credibility is also being undermined by its inability to deliver on previous headline commitments. In 2010, for example, the G20 agreed to what were widely called “historic” changes to the governance of the IMF to recognise the growing power of emerging markets. They were supported by the Obama administration, but remain blocked in the US Congress. In the meantime the Brics nations – Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa – became so frustrated they have moved to set up a development bank of their own. That directly undermines one reason given back in 2008 for the G20 to take over as a leaders’ forum coordinating global economic policies – that its membership better reflects the realities of the modern global economy. When it took over as G20 president in 2014, Australia was determined to bolster its influence by focusing squarely on the organisation’s original goals – economic growth, stronger financial institutions and free trade. It was so determined negotiators should keep focused it decreed the final communique could be no longer than three pages (something it appears will only be achieved by the addition of voluminous appendices). The three pages remain under wraps but the basics of what is supposed to be agreed in Brisbane are clear. In February the G20 finance ministers agreed to list new policies that could boost the collective growth of their economies by an extra 2% over the next five years – which would be worth $2tn (£1.27tn) if it ever happened. The Brisbane action plan will list the 1,000 or more nominated policies, which makes it a lot more detailed than the St Petersburg action plan from the last G20 summit, where the commitments were pretty brief and vague. While the cynical could argue it had probably already occurred to most of the G20 leaders that economic growth was a good thing to aim for, those closely involved in these negotiations say the process means some countries put forward policies they have not previously considered. And the G20 does have a “peer review” process to determine whether countries implement the policies on their list. But Australia’s own list of policies demonstrates the limitations of the process – containing several measures that have not, and may never, pass the parliament. Civil society groups are concerned the action plan – at Australia’s instigation, they claim – now omits previous references to the need for “inclusive” economic growth that does not exacerbate inequality. “The Australian government has refused to commit to inclusive growth and does not acknowledge the impact of inequality on growth. Financial institutions and many other G20 governments do recognise the issue as a threat to growth and among them is next year’s host, Turkey,” said Oxfam spokeswoman Claire Spoors. Tim Costello, the chief executive of World Vision and the co-chair of the C20, a civil society process feeding into G20 deliberations, said: “It appears the language about equality and inclusive growth has been taken out and we are hearing that is at Australia’s instigation.” The Australian prime minister, Tony Abbott, says the growth plan will automatically translate into additional jobs, but civil society observers like Costello counter that this is not necessarily the case if the growth is inequitable. Global companies have been legally outwitting national tax agencies for years. In Brisbane leaders will be asked to agree to these measures: • A “common reporting standard” – a requirement that banks identify and report on the tax affairs of non-residents to their home country. Countries will also be asked to say when they will start the new rule, aimed at flushing out individuals and companies hiding their wealth in offshore tax havens. This has already been negotiated through the OECD and many countries formally signed an agreement to automatically exchange information in Berlin last month. • A pledge to force multinationals to report their accounts country by country to avoid tax avoidance through complicated deals and profit shifting. But the multinationals’ country by country reports will only be available to tax authorities, not to the public. And some countries, including Australia, have delayed the scheme’s implementation for a year. Spoors said the recent leaked tax documents showing how thousands of major companies were legally minimising tax through tax deals involving Luxembourg proved that public reporting of country by country profits would be a much more effective deterrent. • A pledge to force companies and other legal entities to agree to principles about disclosing the beneficial ownership of companies. Transparency International claims China has been blocking agreement on this. The Doha round of global multilateral trade talks have been limping along for more than 10 years and broke down completely in August after India refused to back a deal finalised in Bali in 2013 unless it included concessions allowing developing countries freedom to subsidise and stockpile food. The G20’s official website declares it will “seek a G20 commitment to timely implementation of the WTO trade facilitation agreement concluded in Bali, Indonesia, in December 2013”. Negotiators, however, concede its efforts are unlikely to make much of a difference. As reported by the Guardian, Australia has reluctantly conceded the final G20 communique could include climate change as a single paragraph, acknowledging that it should be addressed by UN processes. Australia’s original position was that the meeting should focus solely on “economic issues”. But the surprise announcement by Barack Obama and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, of post-2020 greenhouse emission reduction targets on Wednesday has ensured climate change will be a major issue at the G20, despite the host nation’s reluctance. The text that has so far made it through the G20’s closed-door, consensus-driven process reads: “We support strong and effective action to address climate change, consistent with sustainable economic growth and certainty for business and investment. We reaffirm our resolve to adopt a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the United Nations framework convention on climate change that is applicable to all parties at the 21st conference of the parties in Paris in 2015.” Australia has also been resisting a last-ditch push by the US, France and other European countries leaders to endorse contributions to the Green Climate Fund – as they did last year in St Petersburg. The fund aims to help poorer countries cut their emissions and prepare for the impact of climate change, and is seen as critical to securing developing-nation support for a successful deal on reducing emissions at the UN meeting in Paris next year. A key Australian “announceable” in Brisbane will be the establishment of a global infrastructure hub, to be based in Sydney. It would match investors with infrastructure projects and help establish uniform rules for risk assessments and other practices. But Australia has been unable to convince other countries to make major financial contributions, and many were concerned it would duplicate work already being done by the World Bank and resisted the idea of the G20 spawning a new permanent institution. Undeterred, Australia appears to have won support for a temporary, four-year “hub”, financed primarily by the Australian government and Australian businesses. As well as the formal agenda items, G20 meetings also give leaders a chance to discuss pressing issues of the day, which in Brisbane are certain to be the global response to Ebola, the conflict in the Ukraine, the international action against Islamic State (Isis) in Iraq and Syria, and Russia’s response to the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. With the IMF revising down its global growth forecasts, the World Trade Organisation revising down estimated growth in global trade volumes and multilateral trade talks stalled, the G20’s “core business” is vital, but it remains unclear whether the meeting’s deliberations will make any difference."

"Australia is under intense pressure to announce a target for post-2020 greenhouse gas reductions after the shock announcement from US president Barack Obama and Chinese premier Xi Jinping of new national climate change goals. The US has agreed to cut its emissions by 26-28% of 2005 levels by 2025 – a doubling of the pace of its reductions. If Australia were to make similar cuts by 2025 against its 2000 benchmark, it would need to reduce emissions by between 28% and 31%. Asked where the deal left Australia’s climate change policy, the expert adviser to the former government Professor Ross Garnaut said: “Exactly where it was before the US-China announcement – up shit creek.” Australia has so far said only that it would “consider its post-2020 target as part of the review … in 2015 on Australia’s international targets and settings”, taking into account what trading partners promise, and has been strongly resisting discussion of climate change at the G20 on the grounds that the meeting should focus on its central economic agenda. It has not announced how it will determine its post-2020 target, nor when it will make it public. The environment minister, Greg Hunt, responded to the announcement by repeating this position: “We have always said that we will consider Australia’s post-2020 emissions reduction targets in the leadup to next year’s Paris conference. This will take into account action taken by our major trading partners. “In the meantime, what’s important for Australia is that we have replaced Labor’s ineffective and costly carbon tax with a policy that will actually deliver significant emissions reductions.” China, the world’s largest greenhouse emitter, has now agreed its emissions will peak by 2030 at the latest, and then begin to decline. China had previously only ever agreed to reduce the rate at which its greenhouse emissions were increasing. It has also agreed that 20% of China’s energy should come from zero emissions sources by 2030. Australian politicians have often cited increasing emissions from China as evidence that it is futile for Australia to take stronger action on climate change. As reported by Guardian Australia, Australia has reluctantly conceded the final G20 communique should include climate change, but has been resisting a last-ditch push by the US, France and other European countries for the leaders gathering in Brisbane this weekend to endorse contributions to the Green Climate Fund – as they did last year in St Petersburg. The Green Climate Fund aims to help poorer countries cut their emissions and prepare for the impact of climate change, and, along with individual national emission reduction pledges, is seen as critical to securing developing-nation support for a successful deal in Paris. It is understood the G20 communique’s references to climate change have been expanded as negotiators finalise the text in the lead-up to the weekend meeting. A spokesman for the Climate Institute think tank, Erwin Jackson, said Australia was “looking like it has been caught with its pants down on climate change action”. The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, said that “while the United States and China show global leadership, Tony Abbott is sticking his head in the sand”. “At the G20 this week, Australia will hold the embarrassing title of being the only nation going backwards on climate change,” he said. The Climate Institute has calculated Australia should be looking at a 40% reduction by 2025. The government’s Direct Action climate policy to reduce emissions with $2.5bn worth of competitive government grants to businesses and organisations is intended to meet the target of cutting Australia’s greenhouse gases by 5% by 2020. Europe has already indicated a 2030 target of at least 40% below 1990 levels. The calculation of a 40% cut by 2030 is broadly in line with the findings of the independent Climate Change Authority, which recommended Australia reduce emissions by 40% to 60% below 2000 levels in 2030. Garnaut said the government should allow the authority, with its excellent professional staff, to provide recommendations on Australia’s post-2020 target, but it would need to be “comparable with the US for Australia to be seen to be doing its fair share”. Greens leader Christine Milne said Tony Abbott was “so busy unwinding Australia’s climate policies that he failed to notice the global economy is changing around him. He is risking billions of dollars in investment and thousands of jobs. Tony Abbott is engaging in intergenerational theft while the rest of the world moves to protect future generations and the planet. “Until the Abbott government took control, Australia was a world leader in climate policy with an emissions trading scheme that was considered template legislation for other nations,” she said."
"Poland and other eastern Europe countries have categorically rejected the target put forward by the world’s top climate scientists to reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2100 to avoid dangerous global warming, leaked documents show. On Sunday, the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said that fossil fuels must be entirely phased out by the end of the century to keep temperatures from rising as high as 5C above pre-industrial levels, a level that would have catastrophic impacts worldwide.  On 28 October, a few days before the IPCC synthesis report was published, EU environment and energy ministers meeting in Brussels were presented with a proposal by states including Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany to incorporate the IPCC target into EU policy. However, it was judged not to have “sufficient support” because of opposition from Poland, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Latvia who “categorically rejected” it, according to a internal briefing note seen by the Guardian. Poland has vetoed past EU attempts to set climate objectives, and invested political capital in positioning itself as a leader of the Visegrad countries in the run up to the EU’s decision on climate targets for 2030. The European commission (EC), represented by the outgoing climate commissioner, Connie Hedegaard, gave only lukewarm support to the zero emissions idea, saying it was “all in favour of having a direction in which we should be going but it might be a bit premature to state it so directly – not all member states will probably be ready to do so”. Detlef van Vuuren, a lead author on the IPCC report, told the Guardian: “I’m quite surprised that this would be an important thing for the Visegrad countries to be worried about, because for them the question has been more about near-term reductions.” “To reach the 2C target, being at or below zero emissions is a requirement,” he added. “It is not possible to have any form of stabilisation of the climate by 2100 without that.”  “I really find this a disgrace,” the Dutch Green MEP Bas Eickhout said. “After the IPCC report, everyone again said it was shocking, the science is clear, we should no longer delay action. And then as soon as it comes to political decisions, they step back from that. It just seems to be empty words every time. This is one of the key reasons why people don’t trust politics anymore.” Ministers at the summit, which was attended by the UK energy secretary, Ed Davey, also agreed not to insist on an assessment of countries’ carbon-cutting pledges ahead of next year’s climate summit in Paris, after opposition from France, Poland and the Czech Republic. An assessment had been supported by powerful EU players including the UK, Germany and the EC, mindful of failure at the Copenhagen summit in 2009, when climate pledges were not telegraphed beforehand. But the final text said only that contributions would be “properly considered and analysed in advance of the Paris conference”. The EU ministers also agreed to leave the question of binding resource efficiency targets off a review agenda for the rest of the decade, after opposition from around half of the bloc’s nations. The argument that waste recycling, management and prevention goals would ‘dilute’ Europe’s focus on other 2020 targets was made by countries such as Britain, Germany, Ireland, Austria, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Romania.  Poland led other states arguing that it would be premature to adopt such goals without a more robust set of indicators. The outgoing environment commissioner Janez Potocnik responded that far from being premature, “we were already too late and needed to catch up; the world has changed since the Europe 2020 targets were set in 2010”. A consensus was finally reached to ask the commission to integrate resource efficiency into the EU’s 2020 strategy by “the introduction of an EU non-binding aspirational target”."
"The hotel receptionist calls this mid-September low season the “calm before the madness”. Wandering through Davos on a biting autumn morning, “calm” feels like an understatement. The winter sports museum is closed, the ski rental shops are empty or shuttered, and in the carriages of the Parsennbahn funicular, which hums quietly up to Davos’s largest ski area, the few tourists have room to wander around. As the funicular glides to a halt at 2,663m on the Weissfluhjoch ridge, I follow a pair of mountain bikers out into the thin air, heading for a vertiginous platform that looks north towards Klosters across the shoulder of the Todalp mountain. The lifeless lunar surface (“tod” is German for “dead”) is bare but for heaps of building material and the wooden deck of a ski bar which lies marooned amid the scree. A month from now, however, the annual transformation of the Todalp will begin. Snow will bury the rocks and fill the hollows on the upper slopes and paint these grey-browns a fetching white. The landscape will be changed into what Thomas Mann called “the towering marble statuary of the high Alps in full snow”, in his novel The Magic Mountain. Once again, Davos-Klosters will make sense as a place where royals, presidents and the super-rich come to play. The snow won’t simply prettify the landscape, it will also increase its value: skiers will pay hundreds of pounds for a six-day lift pass, while the wealthiest winter visitors will spend several thousands to stay for a week in the town’s more expensive hotels. Mann came to Davos in the early 20th century, when the winter transformation was entirely nature’s work. These days, it is Florian Grimm’s job to give nature a hand. Grimm (“like the brothers,” he says disarmingly) is the Parsenn ski area’s head of snow management. When I meet him at the bottom of the funicular, together with Frédéric Petignat, the resort’s communications director, he is wearing a dirty fleece and a broad-shanked gold ring in his left ear. In these last few weeks of preparation for the ski season he is busy organising the giant effort of snow production that lies ahead. One night in October, when the temperature and humidity conditions are right, he will switch on the first set of giant yellow snow cannon and begin to spray out millions of litres of cold water mixed with air which will freeze and drop to the ground as manmade snow. He will cover two high, north-facing pistes first, building up a base layer that will help to prevent the natural snowfall from melting. When the snow is deep enough, the machines will switch to making a lighter, drier top layer that will feel to the skier like new-fallen natural snow. “We will try to run the snow-producers every hour possible in October,” Grimm says, “because most Octobers you don’t expect to get 10 nights that are below freezing.” As the snow piles up, snow tractors will move in to sculpt the ice particles and create the optimal snow sports experience, and as winter progresses and temperatures cool through November and December, Grimm will edge snow production down the mountain. By Christmas – when suites at the Belvédère hit $8,220 (£5,100) a week – Grimm aims to have every run in the resort open, even if natural snowfall has been poor. Ten or 15 years ago, when artificial snow-making was in its infancy, the resort had a handful of snow cannon which fired out large, crude ice pellets. They had to drag the machines all over the resort and keep them working throughout the season to fill holes in the pistes. Now they have 380, many of which are automated and fixed in position, and this massive capacity means the resort can exploit even a small window of low temperatures quickly. The result is much better, more reliable conditions for a clientele ever harder to please. “Today nobody would accept stones any more, or spots of grass in spring,” says Grimm. “They just want to have white from the top to the valley, and they know we have a system to do this.” The machines are surprisingly energy efficient, but at up to an estimated £5 per cubic metre, large quantities of manmade snow are not cheap. Ten years ago, says Petignat, a skier’s lift ticket just paid for the lift system. Now it is combined with the profits from the bars and restaurants to pay for the snow and the piste-modelling too: “It would not be possible to run the mountain without that.” Climate change is not something many ski resorts want to talk about. Marketing executives who respond positively to my initial inquiry become elusive when the c-word is mentioned. In a multibillion dollar business where snow reputations are crucial, it is easy to see why. Grimm and Petignat are keen to point out that climate change has barely affected Davos-Klosters, one of the highest and most snow-sure resorts in the Alps. There is no question, however, that warming has begun to hit the world of winter sports, and a 2007 poll found that the industry believes artificial snow is its best defence. Capacity around the world has massively expanded since then: manmade snow production in Switzerland grew from less than 10% of piste area in 2000 to 36% in 2010, while Austria reached 62% at the end of the same period. In the north-eastern US, according to Elizabeth Burakowski, a researcher at the National Centre for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, around 98% of resorts now rely on artificial snow. Without it they can no longer be certain of opening during the crucial Christmas and New Year period when they earn 20% of their revenue. The Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research (SLF) is housed in a modern glass and concrete building on Flüelastrasse, a few hundred metres from the bottom of the Parsennbahn funicular. Part-funded by the Swiss government, the SLF is arguably the leading snow science institute in the world. (Its main rival, the Snow and Avalanche Study Establishment in Himachal Pradesh, was set up by the Indian government to advise the army how best to use snow in its battles with the Pakistani army 5,000m up on the Siachen glacier.) Christoph Marty, a tall, 46-year-old, is the SLF’s expert in snow and climate change: in 2008 he published a research paper that found evidence of a step change in the rate of decline of snow coverage in the winter of 1988-89. Recently, however, northern Europe has seen several very snowy winters, while the scientific community has debated an apparent slowdown in the rate of warming in the past 15 years. Is it possible, I ask, that climate change may end up giving northern Europe more snow? “There is no doubt in my mind that it will get warmer and we will have less snow,” says Marty. “I can say as long as I live at this altitude that I will have snow. But I have three kids, and they will have kids too. Never mind the grandchildren, my kids will experience a time where it is not normal that you can ski, where it is not normal you will have snow. For them it’s really a frightening thing to think about.” The easiest way to express the rate of decline of natural snow, he says, is in terms of altitude. Assuming a rising temperature trend of 3.5C over 100 years (the Alps are warming faster than the European average), by mid-century the snowline will have risen between 150m and 200m, and by 2100 it will have moved upwards 300m to 400m. Perennial ice in Europe then will be a rare commodity: forecasts for Switzerland show that 90% of the country’s glaciers will have disappeared by the end of the century. As for the longevity of winter sports, “it really depends what exactly you are asking for,” says Marty. “For snowshoeing or building a snowman you don’t need that much snow, whereas if you are a ski manager you have to groom the rough mountain slopes. The natural variability of snow cover is also really large, so even in the past we had winters with very little snow and winters with huge amounts and we will still have that, but it will be shifted so that we will have fewer winters with lots of snow and more and more with little snow.” Several small low-lying Swiss resorts have already become unviable, and for others it is just a matter of time. The ski areas with the best chances of surviving will be those that are highest, and Switzerland and France are better placed in that regard than Austria or Germany. Marty also warns that warming will not necessarily happen in the linear way people expect, and there are social factors to consider: “Do the people still want to go skiing if the village like Davos and Chamonix is totally green and warm? When you won’t have the winter feeling?” Winter sports are already flatlining, or even declining, in Europe and the US, in part because of the enhanced competition from long-haul winter destinations. Those that do come tend to be more opportunistic, Marty says. “Tourists say it’s a problem for them, they don’t come for a week any more just for a few days if they see the weather is good. At Christmas you can go to Egypt for scuba diving, which probably costs no more than skiing, and your chances of good conditions are much better than if you book for a week in the Alps, when nobody can tell you what the snow or weather conditions will be.” There are, of course, greater reasons to lament the loss of snow than the demise of a sport, even if its roots go back at least 10,000 years. Synte Peacock of the atmospheric research centre in Boulder reels off a long list of benefits that the planet’s large expanses of snow and ice provide. Among the most significant is the albedo effect: snow reflects the sun’s radiation back into space and helps to keep the Earth cool. The reduction in global snow cover, which is particularly serious in the Arctic, is part of a dangerous positive feedback loop in which higher temperatures mean less snow, less reflected energy and therefore increasing temperatures. Scientists believe this is part of the reason why the Alps and the Arctic are warming more quickly than average. Water storage is also a major issue: snow and snow-fed glaciers do an extraordinarily efficient job of retaining water in winter, when precipitation is plentiful, and releasing it steadily through spring and summer. Marty describes the Alps as the “water towers of Europe”, and when they are gone – even if their absence is mitigated by increased rainfall caused by a warmer atmosphere – water will likely run short and the levels of major rivers will fall. “Some parts of the world are very dependent on glacier water storage, and if we lose the glaciers it will be a big problem,” says Peacock. “This will totally change the distribution of when water is available. As you lose your winter storage of drinking water, there are places where you’re going to have to start shipping drinking water in. “And it’s not just about drinking water, it will change the amount of water available for irrigation for farming in a lot of areas. In parts of the world – south Asia and Switzerland, for example – glacial runoff is also used for irrigation: that will change.” Water shortages are also likely to reduce the capacity of hydroelectric projects, and may force hundreds of millions of tonnes of shipping carried on major rivers such as the Rhine to move to road or rail. Other knock-on effects of the snow shortage include the threat to animal and plant species that are dependent on snow, the thawing of Siberian permafrost, which will release vast quantities of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide and methane, and the melting, over a period of centuries, of the Greenland ice sheet, which contains enough water to raise global sea levels by seven metres. Among the more catastrophic scenarios, the decline in winter tourism may seem irrelevant. But it is the immediate economic benefit of snow that people care about most, Marty says. Laurent Vanat, a winter sports consultant based in Geneva, estimates the world’s ski industry is worth $60n-$70bn (£37bn-£43bn). However small a fraction of the global economy that may be, it is critical to mountainous regions in Europe and North America. Vanat estimates that 44% of the 400 million global skier visits in the world are to the Alps, while the US, with the largest number of skiers, accounts for 21%. “For Switzerland as a whole, tourism is very important,” says Marty, “but the regional economy here can’t really exist without tourists. So if you take a town like Davos, about 70% to 80% of the economy is tourism-dependent. If there is no possibility to ski here any more, then I would say at a guess that half of the inhabitants will have no job, because even the bakery sells less bread and so on. So regionally and locally the impact is huge.” Faced with an uncertain future, mountain towns and villages are already trying to diversify into leisure activities that are independent of snow. Burakowski cites the case of Jay Peak, a low-lying resort in Vermont which invested a substantial amount in indoor water parks and alternative activities during the winter season: “They survived the 2011-2012 warm winter – the Winter That Never Was in the north-eastern US – pretty darn well and I think that adaptation strategy really helped them.” She believes other resorts in the region are now starting to look at diversification more seriously. In Davos-Klosters, meanwhile, there is a vast array of snow-free pursuits, including two golf courses and a driving range, a lake for water sports and a giant ice arena. Still, as people who live in Davos have noted, the town is much less busy in summer than winter. Snow still produces a vital part of the town’s income and the resort’s managers are working hard to make the most of it. At Marty’s instigation, I drive a short distance east out of town to see the results of another new technique ski areas have begun using: snow farming. A short way up a wooded valley I turn down a muddy track towards a creek. Ahead is what appears to be a heap of several hundred tonnes of woodchip. In fact, underneath its 50cm-thick insulating blanket of bark lies a vast pile of old snow which the resort made in the last cold days of spring and stored in this cold spot next to the creek. Although 20% of it will have melted over the summer months, enough will be left by the start of the new season to lay down a 1.5km cross-country piste. None of this, however – not the snow-making, the snow-farming or even the wrapping of glaciers in insulating blankets – is going to do much to slow the creep of the mean natural snowline upwards. Only a combination of politics and major investment in scientific solutions has any chance of doing that. I put it to Burakowski that in view of its dependency on snow, the ski industry has woken up surprisingly late to climate change. “When you think about helicopter skiing and the amount of driving they do and the fossil fuels they use to get up and down the mountains and to make snow, it can be a bit of a conundrum,” she says. Do they get it now? “Two out of the past two or three years in California they just didn’t have the snow, and I think for them it was a wake-up call. The more frequently it happens, the more likely you’re going to say maybe this is actually more of a trend and we’re going to start considering what to do about it.” There are, she says, a number of resorts, including Aspen, which are trying to build a new, more sustainable model of skiing. But a lot of people – including some who work with snow – still don’t seem to take climate change seriously. “When I speak to a lot of people about these projections, they say: ‘Why are you talking about global warming when we had a snowy winter this year?’,” says Peacock. “But one cold winter, or one heavy snowstorm, is weather, not climate. Even in the Rockies, where we’re going to lose nearly all the spring snow cover by 2100, we’re still going to have winters, or maybe consecutive winters, with huge amounts of snow because of these shorter-term patterns. “That’s something which a lot of people, especially politicians in this country, can’t appreciate, because they have one heavy snow in Washington DC and everyone’s up in arms about how climate change must be a great hoax. People don’t seem to be able to see past what is happening on a two- or three-year timescale. The signature of climate change reveals itself on a timescale of decades to centuries, not years.” For Marty, ski companies and skiers alike need to take more responsibility. “It’s easy for me to say, because I live in a mountain country, but for people living in Britain, if they go skiing in the Alps by plane I’m not sure if most of them are aware of what they do to the snow. If I was born there, I don’t know if I would ski or not. It’s difficult.” What will the end of snow mean? “For me,” Marty says, exhaling a lungful of high mountain air, “it would be a terrible thing.” Dr Paul Field from the Met Office sheds some light on snow. Why are snow crystals six-sided?That’s the basic shape of the solid form of water under atmospheric conditions, which is the basis for the snow crystals – it has that six-sided symmetry. Can every snow crystal really be unique?Two things go into that – the temperature and humidity they are exposed to. No ice crystal will fall in the same way, which means they will grow in different ways. Plus you’ve got things happening at the microscopic level with the crystals actually growing. As you add more water molecules on to each one, there could be differences with the way the crystallographic faces are growing: slight deformities or impurities may affect things. Random collisions and subsequent aggregation (sticking together) of snow crystals are another reason for flakes to be different. Can it ever be too cold to snow?The colder it is, the easier it is to make ice crystals through ice nucleation. If there is any linkage between low temperature and low snowfall it is probably because if you get the air coming up from the south in the UK it is warmer and hence moister, so you can convert more of that water into snow. If it is coming from the north, the air is typically colder and drier. Why is there more snow in the mountains?For one it is higher, so it tends to be colder so the freezing level can be at the ground. Then there’s the orographic effect; because you are forcing the air up, the air gets colder and the relative humidity rises. Water low down in the atmosphere is happy to sit around as vapour because it is warmer and the air is subsaturated but if you take it to a colder temperature it becomes supersaturated - the relative humidity goes up so it wants to condense water out. This extra condensed water will enhance precipitation over the mountains."
"Tasmanian devils’ low genetic diversity and previous population declines were driven by climate change rather than hunting or a rampant facial tumour disease, new research has found. A study of the largest ever genetic dataset of Tasmanian devils found that widespread bounty hunting of the animals after European settlement of Australia is not the primary reason for the species’ worryingly small gene pool. Nor is the devil tumour disease that was discovered in 1996 and has been blamed for a 90% decline in devil numbers in some places.  Researchers found that Tasmanian devils have, in fact, lived with low genetic diversity for thousands of years, having suffered two huge population drops, wiping out around 80% of animals in the past 50,000 years. The first population slump occurred during the last ice age, around 20,000 years ago, with the next decline occurring 3,000 to 5,000 ago when the climate became much drier. Tasmanian devils were once spread across Australia but are now confined to Tasmania. The research suggests that climate change is a much larger threat to Tasmanian devils than previously thought, with current warming temperatures and the facial tumour disease raising major concerns over the species’s future. “Insurance” populations of Tasmanian devils have been established since 2005 in places such as Maria Island in Tasmania, in order to avert the immediate threat of extinction from the facial disease. Tumours are spread between devils when the pugnacious marsupials clash heads while fighting or tussling over food. However, the paucity of genetic diversity among Tasmanian devils poses a threat as it exposes the animals, which are Australia’s largest carnivorous marsupials, to a greater risk of disease. Anna Brüniche-Olsen of the University of Tasmania, who led the research, said devils are “very susceptible” to climate change. “When the climate became more arid with more scrub and grass, it really impacts [on] their numbers,” she told Guardian Australia. “Tasmanian devils are facing a real extinction threat. Tumours are the here-and-now threat and climate change is the next big threat. Given the impact a more arid climate has had on devils in the past, we should be really worried. “The genetic diversity is really low at the moment, which is always a risk because if a disease spreads there is less potential for the devils to adapt. That’s why it’s important that their numbers are managed to conserve as much genetic diversity as possible.” The researchers, from the University of Tasmania and University of Adelaide, used genetic markers to compare genes across individual Tasmanian devils. Once genetic diversity is identified, researchers can build ancestral trees that can allow estimates of previous populations."
"While Chinese apparatchiks will, presumably unquestioningly, jump to realize President Xi Jinping’s order to reduce carbon emissions in an ambitious deal with the United States, Barack Obama will come home to a newly elected Congress that will probably tell him to neuter his climate change agenda or be prepared for the kind of knock-down, drag-out fight that could potentially end with a government shutdown.  Republicans, led by presumptive new Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, of coal-loving Kentucky, have already criticized the Beijing agreement.   But what can McConnell and the GOP really do to stop it? The deal is not a formal treaty, so Obama will not need the Senate to approve it. And while Republicans could pass bills to block provisions of the deal from going into effect, doing so would probably not be much more than symbolic, since Obama can simply click his veto pen into action. The constitution requires two-thirds of the Senate and House to vote to override a veto, and despite their recent wins, the GOP still doesn’t have those kinds of majorities. But while Obama and the executive branch agencies that he controls, like the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), can act on their own to implement the agreement, under the US constitution’s system of checks and balances, Congress pulls the pursestrings. When the next bill containing the EPA’s budget – or the next omnibus piece of legislation to keep the entire government running – comes round, Republicans can attach provisions called “riders” that would undermine, defund and restrict parts of the climate plan. Clinging to an unrelated bill like legislative barnacles, riders could, for example, prevent the EPA from using any money to actually enforce the rules and regulations necessary to implement the agreement.  Riders on an omnibus budget could also put the president in a pickle: unless Obama signs legislation to cripple his own major accomplishment, he could risk shutting down the government. That could flip the circumstances of the 2013 government shutdown, making Obama look like the villain who refuses to keep the government going, and turning Republicans into the reasonable lawmakers who “get us out of government shutdowns”, as McConnell put it.  Republicans could also try to bargain with the president, using narrowly written bills as leverage, getting victories of their own while perhaps conceding something to Democrats in exchange. Obama has never spoken out particularly strongly against the Keystone XL pipeline, for instance, and both parties could try to use it as a bargaining chip. The GOP could also simply try to clog the works a bit. Senator Jim Inhofe, the author of The Greatest Hoax: How the Global Warming Conspiracy Threatens Your Future, would have some power to do that as chair of the environmental committee. Inhofe will likely launch investigations, hindering and possibly delaying implementation of the agreement with hearings and squads of investigators. Green energy projects will be examined with a microscope; green investments decried. Zones of EPA jurisdiction, as tiny as a stream or strait or islet, will be argued and bickered about, and officials in the EPA will have their lives made miserable as senators try to cow them with pressure. Inhofe can also contest EPA rulings like the “endangerment finding”, under which the agency declared that greenhouse gases were a danger to public health and merited regulation. Reports by Inhofe’s investigators can then be used by businesses who challenge the EPA in court, sending the “war on coal and oil” into the long and expensive trenches of the judicial system.  And like most political agendas, there’s always the next election to consider: if the GOP can handcuff the EPA as long as possible, they may be able to play the electoral field into a 2016 win, getting a less-green president in office and shutting the whole thing down."
"The Church of England (CoE) is failing to heed the advice of Desmond Tutu to pull its investments out of fossil fuels, according to Bill McKibben, one of the world’s top climate activists. The retired Anglican Archbishop of South Africa said in April that organisations should divest from coal, gas and oil companies, a call he later reiterated when he said the divestment campaign was “a moral movement to persuade fossil fuel companies away from a business model that threatens our very survival”.  McKibben, a US author and co-founder of environmental group 350.org, told the Guardian that the CoE was dragging its heels when it comes to dropping fossil fuel investments from its £5.2bn fund.  The CoE has set up a group to take advice on climate change and investment, but a decision on whether or not the church should divest is not expected until next year. “Their response so far has been to say that they’ll study it until late 2015, which means they will have examined it for a period slightly longer than Jesus’s public ministry. It’s not exactly what Desmond Tutu had in mind. “If there was ever a moment when we needed strong moral leadership, this is the moment.” In a letter to Church of England newspaper last month, Richard A. Burridge, deputy chair of the ethical advisory group that advises the CoE’s investment bodies, said fossil fuel divestment was not necessarily a silver bullet to the threat from climate change.  “Carbon emissions remain so embedded in our economic system that the EIAG’s [Ethical Investment Advisory Group] ethical investment policy recommendation will need to be sophisticated.“Any response will need to reflect both realism and risk in a way which acknowledges both the nature of the threat and our ability to contribute to a meaningful response,” he wrote. “I have no doubt eventually they’ll do the right thing, I have no doubt eventually everyone will do the right thing. The problem is we don’t have eventually with which to work,” added McKibben, who has become the figurehead for an international movement that has seen divestments by churches, universities, businesses, individuals and local government valued at over $50bn. Glasgow University recently became the first university in Europe to vote to divest from fossil fuels, prompting five geology and engineering academics at the university to hit out at what they called “vacuous posturing” because the institution and Scotland still rely on fossil fuels for energy. “That’s a terrible argument, that’s the worst possible argument,” said McKibben of the staffers’ letter. “We’ll change once it’s no longer necessary, then we’ll be in favour of changing.” But he said the backlash had been greatest in Australia, where Australia National University (ANU) last month decided to ditch its fossil fuel investments, a move the prime minister, Tony Abbott, called a “stupid decision”.  “The backlash has been the most intense in Australia... within days half the government of Australia was attacking them [ANU], and to their credit they held their ground. “If it wasn’t going to make any difference then the prime minister of Australia wouldn’t be up in arms about it. He has a much stronger sense of the threat.” McKibben was also highly critical of a recent capitulation by the EU to Canada over a proposal to label oil from tar sands as highly polluting, which would have effectively banned the carbon-intensive fuel from Europe. In October, the EU abandoned the so-called fuel quality directive, just weeks before EU leaders agreed to cut carbon emissions 40% by 2030. “That was depressing as could be. It’s clearly an intellectual dishonesty. Canada puts enormous pressure, their diplomatic corps is essentially just a bunch of salesmen for tar sands. Canada and Australia have become the two biggest rogue nations on the planet.  “It makes one worry about EU resolve to actually do anything, as to whether or not these headline numbers of 40% add up to anything. You can’t have your cake and eat it.” The US president, Barack Obama, had shown similar contradictions, McKibben said. “Obama’s great at it too, busy drilling for oil everywhere while talking a good game about it. “He’s better than George Bush but I’ve drunk more beer than my 14-year old niece. He’s done a few good things, but judged against the size of the crisis it will be a largely wasted eight years.” Obama’s move to force US car makers to commit to new fuel economy standards over the next decade would be the president’s lasting environment legacy, the 53 year-old campaigner said. McKibben highlighted an organised day of climate marches around the world in September, which saw a reported 400,000 people on the streets of New York, as a sign that the movement for action on climate change was reaching a critical mass. “I think when people write the history of this whole period, they’ll do worse than to pick the 21 of September as the beginning of the end of the fossil fuel industry, with 400,000 people in the streets of New York and the Rockefellers announcing they’re divesting.  “The only question is how fast that end will come. On that question hinges whether we have a habitable world or not. If we can do it in 25 years, then we’ve got a shot, not at stopping global warming but stopping it getting entirely out of control. If we take 50 or 60 years, then forget it, the science couldn’t be clearer.” McKibben was speaking in London ahead of a talk at at the London School of Economics on Tuesday."
"Australia has been labelled a “blocker” for being the main country resisting a G20 commitment to the global Green Climate Fund even as Barack Obama was using the same meeting to pledge $3bn to it. As revealed by Guardian Australia on Saturday, Australia was holding out against pressure from Europe and the US for G20 leaders to back pledges to the fund, which helps poor countries adapt to climate change and is seen as critical to a successful international deal at a United Nations meeting in Paris next year.  A reference to “encouraging” countries to contribute to the fund remains in brackets in the draft final communique – meaning it has not yet been agreed – with the principal objections coming from Australia. It is understood the Australian prime minister, Tony Abbott, and his advisers will have to decide whether to allow the language to proceed in the consensus-driven G20 process. Oxfam’s international executive director, Winnie Byanyima, said Australia should “stop being a blocker” and risked “finding itself isolated in the world”. World Vision’s chief executive, Tim Costello, said: “It would be a terrible embarrassment if Australia, the president of the G20, turned out to be the spoiler on this.”  As revealed by the Guardian on Friday, Obama used a speech in Brisbane to pledge $3bn to the Green Climate Fund. The president’s strong climate speech, in which he insisted nowhere had more to lose from rising temperatures than the Asia Pacific region and Australia in particular, forced the climate issue on the G20 agenda despite the host nation’s reluctance. Abbott has previously insisted Australia would not make any contributions to the green climate fund, although it is understood the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which leads Australia’s negotiating position in international climate talks, has been considering whether Canberra should make a pledge. Sources said no final decision had been made. Asked about the fund before last year’s UN climate meeting in Warsaw, the prime minister said: “We’re not going to be making any contributions to that.” It was reported that at one of its first cabinet meetings the Abbott government decided it would make no contributions to the fund. More than $2.8bn has been pledged to the fund so far – including $1bn by France and almost $1bn by Germany. More pledges are expected at a special conference in Berlin on 20 November. The UK has said it will make a “strong” contribution at that meeting. Australia also pointedly dissented from support for the fund in a communique from last November’s Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting – a stance backed by Canada."
"This time next year, foreign ministers and secretaries of state and climate advisers from around the world – even scientists like me – will be booking their tickets for France, with the hope of signing what could become known as the Paris Accords. These agreements are meant to replace the Kyoto Protocol before it expires in 2020. This is supposed to be the big one: the global deal on global warming. For decades, most environmental diplomacy on even close to this scale focused on huge multilateral forums that were prone to gridlock. The room was too big, so the talks tended to fail – and threatened the planet. But Wednesday’s announcement of a new deal for curbing emissions between China and the US, the world’s two largest polluters, is showing how small-group diplomacy can lead to tangible, even shocking outcomes.  This week’s Beijing agreement may have been concocted in back rooms, in secret, over the course of two years and sealed at the last minute, but “bottom up” initiatives can inspire a cycle of other practical climate-change deals. This moment raises the odds that the Paris accords will reflect real, new initiatives. But first, the word needs similar deals with other big emitters, notably India. China has now pledged that its emissions will peak by 2030 – and it could only do that because China has been quietly adopting aggressive efficiency measures and doing its best to expand output of its least polluting energy sources such as natural gas, nuclear and renewables. India, though, remains far behind: its power plants are less efficient, and its emissions are poised to rise steeply as the country urgently expands its power output mainly by burning coal.  Historically, India has been particularly wary of getting entangled in international commitments on climate change – a problem it prefers to blame on the west. The blame games, however, haven’t done much to control emissions. Narendera Modi, India’s newly elected leader, is a pragmatist who has pledged to engage more directly with the rest of the world and already signaled at his recent U.S. Summit that climate change will be one area where India becomes more cooperative.  The European Union, too, has a central role in the countdown to Paris: its members just announced a scheme to cut emissions 40% by 2030 – the world’s most ambitious emission-control program by a major economy. Brussels and the member states must now flesh out that commitment into practical policies such as energy efficiency, funding for advanced coal demo projects and a renewable energy policy that won’t break the bank. The EU must also show how costly cuts in emissions can be made compatible with economic competitiveness – border tariffs against countries that fail to make their own cuts would help level the playing field and dampen the incentive for countries to neglect making their own commitments.  But a new kind of multinational dealmaking doesn’t just involve a series of country-to-country agreements. It can also include environmental negotiations that cut across whole sectors and pollutants. The best deals will begin with topics that already align with what countries want to do. In 2012, six countries and the United Nations Environment Programme created the Climate and Clean Air Coalition to cut emissions of soot, methane and other so-called “short-lived” climate pollutants. Today, it counts 40 countries as members, because even countries that claim not to care much about long-term global warming can sign up for practical efforts to measure and reduce pollutants that harms the climate and the health of those who breathe. Similarly, Norway has led a group of rich industrialised countries to offer massive cash payments to tropical forest nations, such as Indonesia, that adopt smarter policies that limit deforestation. These are signs of progress, but there is actually precious little time remaining before the Paris summit next December, and that means expectations must be kept in check. For two decades, climate diplomacy has achieved almost nothing in actual reductions of emissions. And it will take time for governments and R&D firms to regain confidence that, this time, climate diplomacy is delivering real results.  With enough deals in enough back rooms, though, governments will have a lot of practical progress they can call familiar once they get to Paris. But with all this “bottom up” momentum, the style of negotiating big agreements must change. Gone are the days when the purpose of big, Kyoto-like agreements was to dictate to countries what they must implement. A new world of governance is unfolding, one big deal, in one small room, at a time."
"Reading opinion columns from Australian prime minister Tony Abbott’s top business adviser Maurice Newman reminds me of those fairground whack-a-mole games. You smash those cartoonish mammals over their fibreglass heads with a big rubber hammer as they emerge from little round holes, yet these little subterranean mammals never know they’re beat and just come up with the same grin somewhere else.  In this climate denialist version of whack-a-mole, the mammal is replaced with Newman’s upper torso clutching the latest truthy climate factoid he has plucked indiscriminately from the intertubes. Just like at the fairground, when you whack-a-Maurice, he just keeps popping up with another myth. The latest version of whack-a-Maurice comes in his new opinion column in The Australian newspaper, headlined “Inconvenient truths ignored by the climate propaganda machine”. In the article, Newman attacks renewable energy, the IPCC, Australian Greens leader Christine Milne and climate science in general while telling us that coal is cheap and reliable and that we should put our self-interest in selling that coal above all else. Newman misrepresents the latest IPCC study, misquotes experts, pushes debunked studies, claims the Scottish Government commissioned a report that it likely never actually commissioned and rounds off by putting his faith in an internet poll that was gamed by climate sceptics. So join me for a game of Whack-a-Maurice®. In the article, Newman starts with three statements about energy prices and how renewable energy projects apparently “destroy jobs” and have been terribly bad news for places that have embraced progressive policies to encourage renewable energy. Newman writes: Clearly [Greens Leader Christine] Milne is unaware of the cost to California, Europe and Britain of their ultra green embrace. The Golden State’s energy prices are 40 per cent above the US national average, plunging its manufacturing and agricultural regions into depression, with one in five living in poverty. OK. While it’s true that Californians do have comparatively expensive electricity costs, they actually have among the lowest average electricity bills across the whole of the United States. This appears due to a combination of the state’s mild climate and its aggressive energy efficiency scheme. California does have a renewable energy target – recently expanded to push the state to get 33 per cent of its power from renewables by 2020. The Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory in the US has studied the impact of renewable target schemes (known there as Renewable Portfolio Standards) in place across the US. The 2007 Berkeley study (carried out before California upped its target) found these RPS schemes added an average of about 38c per month (about one quarter the cost of one take away coffee) to electricity bills. California’s scheme was among those having the lowest impact on bills. In 2012, Californian’s had an electricity bill of about $87 per month. Apparently, in Newman’s razor sharp climate policy mind, it is imposts like a 38c per month rise in electricity prices that is “plunging” the state’s agriculture industry into depression, rather than, say, one of California’s worst droughts in living memory. So now to Spain. Newman writes: Researchers at Spain’s King Juan Carlos University have found renewable energy programs destroyed 2.2 jobs for every green one created. Newman is referring to a report titled: “Study of the effects on employment of public aid to renewable energy sources” that was published in 2009 and written by Gabriel Calzada Alvarez. Alvarez is an associate professor at King Juan Carlos University, but Newman doesn’t mention that the study was actually co-commissioned by the “libertarian” think tank The Instituto Juan de Maria that Alvarez founded.  Alvarez has also presented at a Heartland Institute climate conference for “sceptics” and his institute has been a sponsor of one of those conferences. Who were the other commissioning group?  This was the Institute for Energy Research, a US-based thinktank with strong links to the US Koch brothers, whose foundations have given about $175,000 to the think tank and funnelled millions into anti-climate action projects at similar think tanks. The IER recently claimed Alvarez’s study as its own. But was the study any good?  The US Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory took a studied look at it and, to put it mildly, tore the thing to bits. Here’s some of the choice parts of their critique The analysis by the authors from King Juan Carlos University represents a significant divergence from traditional methodologies used to estimate employment impacts from renewable energy. In fact, the methodology does not reflect an employment impact analysis. Accordingly, the primary conclusion made by the authors – policy support of renewable energy results in net jobs losses – is not supported by their work … Additionally, this analysis has oversimplifications and assumptions that lead to questions regarding its quantitative results. Finally, the authors fail to justify their implication that because of the jobs comparison, subsidies for renewables are not worthwhile. This ignores an array of benefits besides employment creation that flow from government investment in renewable energy technologies. The Alvarez study came in for similar harsh criticism in Spain, as noted here on a blog from the US Natural Resources Defense Council. And so now to whack-a-Maurice in Scotland. Newman writes: A study by Verso Economics commissioned by the Scottish government concluded that for every job in the wind industry, 3.7 jobs were lost elsewhere. Verso Economics? Commissioned by the Scottish government? Sounds impressive. Indeed, when the report was published in March 2011, it was given extensive coverage in Scotland. And what did the Scottish government make of the study? A BBC report tells us the government’s view. This report is misleading. Does it seem odd that the Scottish government should condemn it’s own report? Perhaps one reason is that there appears to be no evidence that the Scottish government actually commissioned the report that Maurice Newman says it commissioned (I have asked the author, an economist called Richard Marsh, for clarification, but the report itself makes no mention of a commission from the Government and, when Marsh gave evidence to a Scottish parliamentary committee the following year in relation to the report, he didn’t mention a government commission then either). Verso Economics appears to have been a very small firm with only two employees, Marsh being one of them. This doesn’t necessarily make the arguments wrong, but it is curious that Newman would choose to use the name of a tiny consultancy once based in Kirkaldy that no loner exists (Marsh is now at another firm). Where’s the next mole? Newman has a crack at former Australian chief scientist Penny Sackett who, according to Newman, had said in 2009 we had only five years to avoid “dangerous global warming”. Plainly if you read Sackett’s words from 2009, she was talking about a time frame to start radically reducing emissions to prevent “dangerous global warming” down the track and not, as Newman implies, a time by which we should all be frying in our own juices. Equally, Newman brings up the bête noire of all Australian climate science denialists, Tim Flannery. Newman writes: When climate commissioner Tim Flannery said that “even the rain that falls isn’t actually going to fill our dams and river systems”, it was sobering, but soon we were donating to flood victims and -suspected he’d dreamt it up to scare us. Again, Newman ignores the fact that Flannery was not talking about the present, but referring to a time decades into the future if emissions remained on their current path. Whack. Next mole? Newman claims that “temperatures have gone nowhere for 18 years” while ignoring that in those 18 years the world has experienced the hottest decade on record. According to the World Meteorological Organisation, 13 of the 14 warmest years on record have all occurred since 2000.  If Newman thinks warming has stopped, why is it that between 2002 and 2011, the two main ice sheets of Antarctica and Greenland were melting at a rate of about 362 billion tonnes of ice a year – an almost six-fold increase in the rate for the previous decade?  Newman keeps popping up like our proverbial mole with a litany of myths.  He says the recent IPCC Synthesis Report  “fails to mention” that the extent of Antarctic sea ice is the highest since records began. The reason it fails to mention this, is that the record was broken well after the underlying reports were finished.  But yet, the Synthesis Report does mention the increase in Antarctic sea ice extent (read my post What’s going on with global warming and Antarctica’s growing sea ice? for more on this). Next. Newman writes: In painting the bleakest picture they can, IPCC authors have projected CO2 levels reaching 1000 parts per million in 2100, largely through coal combustion… Newman wants us to think that the IPCC authors are a bunch of doom merchants, and so ignores the fact that the IPCC report makes a range of projections for the future concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. As well as the admittedly “bleak” scenario of CO2 levels reaching 1000 parts per million in the atmosphere by the end of this century (delivering something like 4C of global warming), the report also projects CO2 levels at 720ppm, 580ppm, 530ppm and 480ppm. Newman would have struggled to have missed this, given they all appear on the same chart. We could go on an on whacking Maurice Newman’s climate denialist moles, and his column has several others, but at some point we have to stop. But not before we dwell on Newman’s closing argument that 91 per cent of people think the IPCC is wrong that we’re heading for 4C of global warming. I think you’ll agree that Newman’s source for this is beyond reproach. It’s one of those really sciencey internet polls carried out by the ABC. So sciencey was the survey, that climate science denialist groups from Australia to the US were telling supporters to visit the poll. This is when we have to remind ourselves that Maurice Newman is the chairman of prime minister Tony Abbott’s Business Advisory Council, handpicked by Abbott himself. As Maurice Newman himself concluded, “Enough said”."

"Food is a political issue for Alice Waters. “I’ve always thought of it that way,” she says. It’s not Australia’s cuisine or sights that have finally lured the 70-year-old chef, author and food activist to Australia but a political event on a global stage. Brisbane’s upcoming G20 conference is the catalyst for Waters’ first visit to the country, where she will speak at both the Sydney Opera House and the Athenaeum theatre in Melbourne about the value of “slow food” in a fast food world.  “I have been encouraged for a very long period of time to come,” she says. Only fear of the long flight held her back. G20’s “very political moment” has been the prompt she needed. “I think – how shall I say this – there are many, many people that are open and wanting to make change.” Waters is the proprietor of Chez Panisse in California, a restaurant regularly listed among the top 50 in the world. But it is the philosophy underpinning Chez Panisse – and Waters’ revolutionary approach to food – that led to Time magazine naming her as one of the world’s 100 most influential people. Her political awakening began as a student at Berkeley when she attended a Free Speech Movement rally. Mario Savio, one of the movement’s leaders, made a speech warning America was “becoming ever more the utopia of sterilised, automated contentment”. Waters wanted to challenge that automation. A year studying abroad in France provided the inspiration for her activism – and a lifelong love of food. She opened Chez Panisse in Berkeley in 1971, adopting a very different approach to the traditional French fine dining that was popular at the time. “When I started the restaurant I was definitely part of a counter culture,” Waters says who was discouraged by the political system of that time. “I thought: ‘I will just open a restaurant and we will bring people around a table and discuss the politics of the day’. I really thought of it as a sort of delicious forum for encouraging people to do the right thing.” Encouraging people to do the right thing included persuading farmer, foragers and fisherman to provide local, organic and sustainable produce for Chez Panisse. This championing of local producers and produce has been credited with sparking the farmers’ market movement in the US – and beyond.  “As it went on, I saw it as a way to encourage people to think about where food comes from,” she says. “It stirred things up in a very good way.” Waters hopes to do more stirring ahead of the G20. “Climate change has been taken off the agenda and I can’t think of anything more important to talk about,” she says. Rather than trying to directly influence those participating in the G20 forum, however, Waters plans on making the most of the media attention that will be focused on Australia. “The timing is right for bringing up all the issues but we want to have a conversation around the country that is provocative,” says Waters, whose key concerns are the impact of global warming on food production and sustainable agriculture. She is particularly critical of the dominance of multinational food companies. “We need to expose the practices of the big food companies which are hijacking all the good terms of our movement – the ideas of sustainability and natural and homegrown. They are using that to promote food that isn’t good for us. We need to read the labelling and get the facts to be put on the table.” In Australia, where two big supermarket chains control 72.5% of the grocery market, Waters says smaller local markets are essential. “Farmers markets are the best way to bring people into a relationship with food, to meet the people who grow it, and to understand the seasonality,” she says. Reconnecting with nature is something that cannot be faked. “No matter how much the supermarkets take our language they can’t take the feeling of real connection with people and aliveness with food.” Good food is a right not a privilege, insists Waters. “The key issue that we need to demystify is that food should be cheap and that good food is unaffordable and that only foodies and rich people can afford to eat this way.” she says. “ It is not true.” Even though a meal at Chez Panisse costs around US$100, she dismisses criticism that the values she advocates are elitist. “In the United States we pay less for food than practically any other country and it’s because we don’t value food. We value everything else but food.”  Waters wants kudos for good food which is “tasty and nourishing” but she also wants it to be democratised, blaming the rise of celebrity chefs and TV shows for making food intimidating. “The fancy cookbooks have made cooking difficult for people,” she says. Waters applauds Australian chefs like Stephanie Alexander and Maggie Beer for working hard to demystify food and cooking. She is an enthusiastic advocate of Alexander’s Kitchen Garden foundation, which encourages schoolchildren to grow and cook their own food, and now works with 10% of Australian primary schools. The scheme is based on Waters’ own Edible Schoolyard program in the US but more still needs to be done, she says. “The big message I am going to talk about in Australia is the idea of feeding all children in school. I know you don’t do that but I really believe it is a necessity,” she says. Waters believes providing free school meals to children creates “a place of equity” and can be used to support local producers. “That’s what I think will really change the way we think about food and the way we eat food.” Alice Waters is at Sydney Opera House on 12 November and the Athenaeum theatre, Melbourne on 17 November • The author is not related to Alice Waters"
"The United States and China have unveiled a secretly negotiated deal to reduce their greenhouse gas output, with China agreeing to cap emissions for the first time and the US committing to deep reductions by 2025. The pledges in an agreement struck between President Barack Obama and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jingping, provide an important boost to international efforts to reach a global deal on reducing emissions beyond 2020 at a United Nations meeting in Paris next year. China, the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world, has agreed to cap its output by 2030 or earlier if possible. Previously China had only ever pledged to reduce the rapid rate of growth in its emissions. Now it has also promised to increase its use of energy from zero-emission sources to 20% by 2030. The United States has pledged to cut its emissions to 26-28% below 2005 levels by 2025. The European Union has already endorsed a binding 40% greenhouse gas emissions reduction target by 2030. Speaking at a joint press conference at the Great Hall of the People, Obama said: “As the world’s largest economies and greatest emitters of greenhouse gases we have special responsibility to lead the global effort against climate change. I am proud we can announce a historic agreement. I commend President Xi, his team and the Chinese government for their making to slow, peak and then reverse China’s carbon emissions.” He said the US emissions reductions goal was “ambitious but achievable” and would double the pace at which it is reducing carbon emissions. “This is a major milestone in US-China relations and shows what is possible when we work together on an urgent global challenge.” He added that they hoped “to encourage all major economies to be ambitious and all developed and developing countries to work across divides” so that an agreement could be reached at the climate change talks in Paris in December next year. Xi Jinping said: “We agreed to make sure international climate change negotiations will reach agreement as scheduled at the Paris conference in 2015 and agreed to deepen practical co-operation on clean energy, environmental protection and other areas.” China’s target to expand energy from zero-emission sources to around 20% by 2030 was “notable”, a White House statement said. “It will require China to deploy an additional 800-1,000 gigawatts of nuclear, wind, solar and other zero-emission generation capacity by 2030 – more than all the coal-fired power plants that exist in China today and close to total current electricity generation capacity in the United States.” The UN’s climate chief, Christiana Figueres, said: “These two crucial countries have today announced important pathways towards a better and more secure future for humankind.”  Herman Van Rompuy, the president of the European Council, and Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission president, urged other countries to show their hand on emissions cuts: “We welcome the announcement today by the presidents of the United States and China on their respective post-2020 actions on climate change. “The announcements to date cover around half of the global emissions. We urge others, especially the G20 members, to announce their targets in the first half of 2015 and transparently. Only then we can assess together if our collective efforts will allow us to fulfil the goal of keeping global temperature increases well below 2C.” The new US goal will double the pace of carbon pollution reduction, though the Republican-controlled Congress is likely to oppose Obama’s climate change efforts. The US Senate’s new Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, was quick to criticise the Beijing pact. “This unrealistic plan, that the president would dump on his successor, would ensure higher utility rates and far fewer jobs,” he said.  Administration officials argue the new target is achievable under existing laws.  Frances Beinecke, president of US-based environmental group the Natural Resources Defence Council, said: “These landmark commitments to curtail carbon pollution are a necessary, critical step forward in the global fight against climate change. We look forward to working with both governments to strengthen their efforts because we are confident that both can achieve even greater reductions.” Senior US administration officials said the commitments, the result of months of dialogue between the world’s top two carbon emitters, would encourage other nations to make pledges and deliver “a shot of momentum” into negotiations for a new global agreement set to go into force in 2020.  Tao Wang, climate scholar at the Tsinghua-Carnegie Center for Global Policy in Beijing, said: “It is a very good sign for both countries and injects strong momentum [into negotiations] but the targets are not ambitious enough and there is room for both countries to negotiate an improvement. “That figure isn’t high because China aims to reach about 15% by 2020, so it is only a five percentage point increase in 10 years, and given the huge growth in renewables it should be higher.” Andrew Steer, president of the World Resources Institute, which promotes sustainable resource management, said the announcements would “inject a jolt of momentum in the lead up to a global climate agreement in Paris”. “It’s a new day to have the leaders of the US and China stand shoulder to shoulder and make significant commitments to curb their country’s emissions,” he said. Li Shuo, of Greenpeace East Asia, said the announcement showed that the world’s “two biggest emitters have come to the realisation that they are bound together and have to take actions together”.  At the Warsaw climate talks in 2013 nations were encouraged to draw up post-2020 climate plans by the first quarter of 2015, ahead of the final negotiations for a post-2020 global pact late in the year. The White House statement said: “Together the US and China account for over one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions. Today’s joint announcement, the culmination of months of bilateral dialogue, highlights the critical role the two countries must play in addressing climate change. “The actions they announced are part of the longer range effort to achieve the deep decarbonisation of the global economy over time. These actions will also inject momentum into the global climate negotiations on the road to reaching a successful new climate agreement next year in Paris.”"
"How do you dramatise climate change? The obvious route, in recent films and novels, has been to imagine a future dystopia of rising sea levels and ravaged landscapes, where wars are fought over scant resources. The danger is that these sci-fi scenarios can seem so outlandish that they have the effect of distancing us from the present reality. Theatre director Katie Mitchell confronted the subject in 2012 when she and the scientist Stephen Emmott explored the issue of overpopulation. “We spent four or five months in workshops trying all the usual theatrical forms to present the subject,” she says, “and we ended up with a load of scenes that were a bit cheesy or ridiculous, that all seemed to diminish and oversimplify and sensationalise the subject. I had to conclude that, in my opinion, using existing theatrical formats was not going to work, and the only way to do it was to get the scientist up there using a different language to talk to people – lay person’s language.”  She took the project to the Royal Court and the result was Ten Billion, a “dramatised lecture” by Emmott that Michael Billington described as “one of the most disturbing evenings I have ever spent in a theatre”. For Mitchell, the experience of working with Emmott was “life changing” in terms of the way she understood what was happening with the climate and the environment. “At the end of that process I stopped flying, I’ve now stopped buying any new clothes – the level of recycling in my house is unbelievable.” She also made a vow that she would make one piece a year that would address these issues. “I wanted to continue the work with scientists,” she says. After working with playwright Duncan Macmillan earlier this year on his play Lungs at the Berlin Schaubühne – a production that was performed entirely off-grid, with the lights powered by actors who performed while pedalling static bikes – she brought him in as dramaturg and co-writer on her next collaboration, this time with Chris Rapley, professor of climate science at University College London. Over the past 10 months of intensive discussions and rewrites, from more than 1,000 pages of transcribed conversations, Macmillan and Rapley have created 2071, which opens tonight at the Royal Court and which Mitchell describes as a companion piece to Ten Billion. “As a dramatist, I’m interested in working with text in a different way,” Macmillan explains, when I meet them during a break in rehearsals at their south London studio. “There was the formal challenge of how to express Chris’s science, and what we could bring to him as theatre-makers – not just with a different audience for those issues, but in terms of technique and how to structure the material. For example, if Chris is writing a scientific paper or delivering an academic lecture, the convention is that you begin with your finding and go on to explain it. But that’s like Hamlet avenging his father’s death in the first five minutes. The simultaneous challenge we’ve had is how to take the anger and emotion out of the issue and at the same time make the data dramatically compelling to listen to.” Both Mitchell and Macmillan are emphatic about the need to allow the “very cool, objective facts” to speak for themselves, through Rapley’s on-stage delivery and supporting video projection. “It’s not heavily theatrical,” Mitchell says. “It’s much more like you’re having a chat with Chris in his living room, and that creates a different relationship with the audience.” “Chris is very clear that we can’t be dictatorial,” Macmillan says. “It’s about saying, what do we know and how do we know it? And doing that in a way that’s open and inclusive.” But there is an unavoidable personal aspect to the piece, implicit in its title: 2071 is significant because it is the year in which Rapley’s eldest grandchild will be 67, the age he is now. Mitchell has a young daughter, and Macmillan became a father for the first time four months ago. “My point has always been that I didn’t want the possibility of these changes occurring and for my child to say to me in 30 years’ time, ‘Did you know? Why didn’t you do anything?’” Mitchell says. “I couldn’t not act because I wanted to be accountable to my daughter in the future.” She acknowledges that, if there was a fault with Ten Billion, it was that it was too bleak (Emmott ended the piece by saying, “I think we’re all fucked”.) By contrast, 2071 offers a glimmer of optimism. “Chris really is keen to encourage people to make constructive choices and take sensible action,” she says, “so it’s not just a punch in the gut. The subject’s been kicked around so much as a political football that I think we just don’t know a lot of the important facts. If theatre can do that in a tiny way – provide a platform for those facts to be communicated – then it’s done something really good and clear.” • Until 15 November. Box office: 020-7565 5000.

"Emissions from Australia’s electricity sector have risen significantly since the repeal of the carbon price, with a record rise in emissions predicted this financial year. An analysis of the National Electricity Market (NEM) by Mike Sandiford, a University of Melbourne energy academic, has shown their emissions will rise about 9% in 2014-15 compared with 2013-14 – the equivalent of 14m extra tonnes of carbon dioxide. The figure could be as high as 10%, according Sandiford.   The NEM covers about 80% of Australia’s electricity consumption. “To put it in historical context, this recent increase in emissions is currently tracking at about 250% higher than the previous largest recorded increase,” Sandiford wrote in the the Conversation. “That was back in 2003-04 when emissions increased by a touch over 5m tonnes for the year.” Sandiford said the increase was clearly linked to the Coalition’s repeal of the carbon pricing mechanism, which was scrapped in July. “The reason is straightforward,” he said. “During the years of carbon pricing, hydro was being dispatched at unsustainable levels. Since repeal the reduction in hydro output has been substantially picked up by brown coal generators in Victoria.” Separate figures released by consultancy firm Pitt&Sherry show that annual NEM emissions were 1.3% higher in the month to September 2014 compared with the year to June 2014, the month before carbon pricing was removed. In a briefing note, Pitt&Sherry said black coal generation has increased 0.5% in this period, with brown coal, the most carbon-intensive type of coal, rising 2.2%. The increase in emissions wasn’t entirely down to the removal of the carbon price, the note stated, with falling gas generation and “considerably less” wind generation causing coal to take up the slack. But it suggested that consumer behavioural changes caused by pricing carbon may be unwinding. “The data suggests that households have been changing their attitudes to electricity consumption, and hence to their consumption behaviour, much as they changed their attitudes and behaviour to water consumption during the drought of a few years ago,” the briefing stated. “We may now be seeing signs that this attitudinal effect has run its course.” Last week, the Coalition gained the Senate votes for its alternative climate change policy, which will provide $2.55bn in voluntary grants to businesses that wish to reduce emissions. Auctions for the emissions reduction schemes will start early next year. The government has hailed figures showing a sharp fall in electricity prices as justification for scrapping the carbon pricing, insisting it will reach its target of a 5% emissions cut by 2020, based on 2000 levels. However, Christine Milne, the leader of the Greens, said she wasn’t surprised that emissions have risen for four months in a row since the carbon price was dismantled. “By putting a price on carbon, we had seen the emissions from electricity generation come down,” she said. “They were down by at least 4%. It was a really good news story. “Now, with the abolition of emissions trading, they are going up and we’re going to see an increased trend of more emissions from black and brown coal, right around the country, to the detriment of the climate.” A major report released by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change on Sunday said fossil fuels should virtually be phased out by 2100 if the world is to avoid dangerous climate change. However, Tony Abbott said on Tuesday that coal will be the “foundation of our prosperity” for the foreseeable future. “Coal is the foundation of the way we live because you can’t have a modern lifestyle without energy,” he said."
"Be in no doubt, the agreement struck by the US and China on Wednesday to cut their carbon emissions is historic. It is the biggest step towards achieving a meaningful global deal to fight climate change in 20 years of tortuous negotiations. But also be in no doubt that, while absolutely necessary, it is a long way from being sufficient. As President Barack Obama says, it is a “milestone” – a marker on a longer journey. Without sharp and rapid cuts in greenhouse gases the world faces “severe, widespread, and irreversible impacts” on people and the natural natural world: floods, droughts and even wars. That conclusion from the world’s scientists was signed off on 2 November by 194 nations.  But no progress was going to happen without the world’s two biggest polluters, the US and China. The deal they have struck has the potential to end the stand-off that doomed efforts to sign a global deal in Copenhagen in 2009. That coalition of the unwilling is now becoming a coalition of the willing. The difficulty of tackling climate change cannot be overestimated. Emissions now mean damage later, making it tempting to stall. It is a “global commons” problem - the solution requires all nations to act together, not alone. Moreover, in practical terms, it requires re-engineering the entire world’s energy system, which is itself the engine of the global economy. And there’s the huge challenge of solving global poverty along the way. With so much at stake, the negotiations are the among the toughest the world’s nations have ever undertaken. But, put bluntly, it’s a haggle. There is a limit to how much CO2 can be pumped into the atmosphere before dangerous climate change becomes inevitable. The bartering is over how much of that remaining space each nation deserves to get. The significance of the China-US deal is that they have now put their first serious offers on the table. In fact they have done so early – the deadline for these bids set by the UN was March 2015. The deadline for a final global deal is December 2015 in Paris. Until now, it was unclear that deal would be done. But the US-China agreement has injected that most precious and rare of commodities into global climate negotiations: momentum. There is a long way to go yet. The measures announced by the US and China fall well short of what is needed to defeat global warming. The key, as in any haggle, is to keep upping the bids. Obama said the US pledge to cut carbon by 26-28% by 2025, compared to 2005 levels, would double the pace at which it is reducing its emissions. But it’s a smaller cut than that agreed in October by the EU. Its 40% cut by 2030 is compared to a higher baseline of 1990. China has pledged to get 20% of its power from zero-carbon sources by 2030. But is already on track for 15% by 2020. The signal that these are opening bids is in the qualifying language. China’s emissions will reach their peak by 2030 “or earlier”. The EU’s carbon cut is “at least” 40%. The US-China deal is also highly significant in the clear signal it sends to the energy industry, who will invest trillions of dollars in the coming decades. China has said clearly for the first time that its huge hunger for coal will soon be sated. The US has said its wants to use less oil and gas, not more. Those are warning signs for today’s climate deal refuseniks, coal-rich Australia and oil-sand-rich Canada, and their fossil fuel friends.  Instead, the US-China deal points to clean and renewable energy as the place for the smart money to go. China’s pledge of 20% clean energy by 2030 means 800-1,000GW of new wind, solar, nuclear and other zero-emission technology. That addition alone is about the same size as the entire US electricity sector today. John Kerry, US secretary of state, provided a clear-headed summary of Wednesday’s US-China agreement. “There is no question that all of us will need to do more to push toward the de-carbonisation of the global economy. But in climate diplomacy, as in life, you have to start at the beginning, and this breakthrough marks a fresh beginning.”  Finally, 25 years after the world was first warned that global warming was a serious problem, we have reached the start of the solution.  • This article was amended on 13 November 2014. An earlier version said “underestimated” where “overestimated” was meant. "
"Ross Garnaut is usually professorial in his language. But the academic who wrote two voluminous climate policy reports for the former government used front-bar vernacular when asked where Wednesday’s historic climate announcement by China and the US has left Australia. “Up shit creek,” he said. In the US, China and the EU the ambition of climate policy is growing.  In Australia it just keeps getting smaller. We have been shouting so long and so loudly about how we had to avoid getting “ahead of the world”, hyperventilating about how a relatively modest carbon tax would end economic life as we knew it (even after it was introduced and it didn’t) that we seemed not to notice we were in fact being left behind. Having failed to get a cap and trade scheme through congress, President Barack Obama unveiled tough regulations for the power sector. And then, standing side by side with China’s President Xi Jinping, he has pledged cuts of 26%-28% below 2005 levels by 2025 – the next step beyond the existing promise to cut emissions 17% by 2020. China had previously promised to cut the emissions intensity of its economy – emissions per unit of GDP – a measure that allowed absolute emissions to continue to rise. At the same press conference it pledged its emissions would peak in 2030 and then decline. And in Australia? Well before the election the Coalition promised, in writing, to reduce emissions by 2020 by between 5% and 25%. But after the election that became 5% – and absolutely no more. Anything longer term we haven’t really got around to discussing. The carbon tax has gone and government’s efforts to reduce the renewable energy target have stalled all investment in clean energy. The Coalition’s Direct Action policy is in place, but not the safeguards that might have slowed emissions growth across the economy. Obama argues that “a low-carbon, clean-energy economy can be an engine of growth for decades to come” and the joint US-Chinese statement says “economic evidence makes increasingly clear that smart action on climate change now can drive innovation, strengthen economic growth and bring broad benefits”. Tony Abbott still insists “coal is good for humanity” and its use should go “up and up and up in the years and decades to come” – but then cuts spending on the carbon capture and storage technology that, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, is the only way coal will be able to be used into the future.  It is, as the US is demonstrating, possible to reduce emissions by means other than a carbon price. Tough regulations or carefully targeted and rigorously assessed government incentives can also do the job. But Direct Action, as it stands, is unlikely to be a viable alternative and its costs will certainly become prohibitive as Australia is required to reduce its emissions further – as Malcolm Turnbull kept telling us and has been repeatedly borne out by modelling (done by third parties because the government hasn’t done any, preferring as Abbott said during the election campaign, to just “have a crack”). And so we find ourselves under extreme pressure to make much deeper cuts to emissions without any cost-effective policy to get us there. Not just up shit creek, but without a paddle."
"The Senate’s top environmental job is set to fall to Jim Inhofe, one of the biggest names in US climate denial, but campaigners say Barack Obama will fight to protect his global warming agenda. Oklahoma Republican Inhofe has been denying the science behind climate change for 20 years – long before it became a cause for the conservative tea party wing. Following midterm elections which saw the Republicans take control of the senate, he is now expected to become the chairman of the senate environment and public works committee.   However, advocates believe Obama will work to protect his signature power plant rules from Republican attacks, and to live up to his earlier commitments to a global deal on fight climate change. “We think he sees this as a critically important part of his second term legacy and there is no reason why he should not continue to go forward on this... both domestically and around the world,” Gene Karpinski, president of the League of Conservation Voters, told a press briefing. The campaigners were less clear, however, how far Obama would be willing to fight to block the Keystone XL pipeline project. Obama will get a chance to show he is still committed to fighting climate change during a trip to Beijing next week, where the US and Chinese are expected to announce new energy co-operation. Extracting a pledge from China to cut emissions is hugely important now for Obama, who faces growing pressure from Republicans to demonstrate that other countries beyond the US – especially the high-emissions, rising economies – are acting on climate change. “It is a domestic political imperative for the president to gain emissions reductions from China and other major emitters as much as it is an international policy goal,” said Paul Bledsoe, a climate change official in the Clinton White House. “The president is under increasing pressure to gain emissions reductions from China and other major emitters in order to justify US domestic mitigation policy. That is going to be the spin Republicans put on it – that we are wasting our time with domestic emissions reductions because they will be swamped by developing countries’ pollution.” Obama is going to feel that pressure the most from Congress. With his opponents now in control of both houses, the top slot on the Senate’s environment and public works committee passes from a climate defender, the California Democrat, Barbara Boxer, to Inhofe.   He published a book in 2012 calling global warming a hoax, and has compared the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to the Gestapo. A spokeswoman for Inhofe said his first concern was passing the defence budget, and that he would make no comment on his leadership roles until next week. But if, as expected, Inhofe becomes the new committee chair next January, he will probably try to dismantle the EPA rules cutting greenhouse gas emissions from power plants – the centrepiece of Obama’s environmental agenda. Industry lobbyists and campaigners said Inhofe lacked the votes to throw out the power plant rules entirely. Obama would also veto any such move, said Scott Segal, an energy and coal lobbyist with Bracewell & Giuliani. “I’m not sure we have the votes to advance those across the finish line particularly if they are vetoed,” Segal told a conference call with reporters. Instead, he said he expected “tailored changes”, which could weaken the rules. Bledsoe did expect, however, that Obama will sign off on the controversial Keystone XL project early next year. Republicans have said approving the pipeline, built to pump tar sands crude to Texas Gulf Coast refineries, would be an early order of business. Obama in his post-election press conference gave no indication what he would decide. But Bledsoe said: “I actually believe the president is likely to approve the piepline and in the process deny Republicans a politically potent issue.” From his perch in the Senate, Inhofe is expected to launch multiple investigations into the EPA – including Republican charges that the agency leaned heavily on a campaign group in drafting the proposed new rules. But as committee chair, Inhofe is unlikely to indulge in quite the same level of theatrics on climate denial, said RL Miller, a California lawyer and founder of the grassroots organising group, Climate Hawks Vote. “I expect we are going to see less headline-grabbing efforts on the EPA and more of simply throttling their budget,” Miller said. “If he touches climate denial at all he is going to be ridiculed in public and in the media. If he is smart, he is going to be very quiet publicly, and it will be death by a thousand cuts in the kind of budget battles that people like Jon Stewart don’t pay attention to.” Despite their upbeat postures, Tuesday’s results were a big setback for campaign groups which had invested an unprecedented amount in trying to elect pro-climate candidates to Congress. The former hedge fund billionaire, Tom Steyer, spent nearly $75m on advertising and organising in only seven races, making him the biggest known single spender in these elections. Only three of his candidates won. “There is no way to dance around the issue that in too many races we lost good allies,” Michael Brune, the director of the Sierra Club, told a briefing. “We see those people being replaced by people that are against our values.” But the environmental leaders blamed the poor showing on low turnout in an off election year – and continued to insist that climate change was becoming a top-tier issue. They insisted their effort had put climate change on the electoral map – a big shift from 2012 when virtually no candidates would even utter the words climate change. This time around, Republican candidates were forced to back away from outright climate denial, the campaigners said.  They noted Cory Gardner, the newly elected Republican Senator from Colorado, had appeared in campaign ads with wind turbines, after earlier disparaging climate science. “Climate denial is an endangered species,” Brune said."
"Bill Shorten has accused Tony Abbott of “stubborn isolationism” on climate change that could hurt Australia’s international trade in the long term. Responding to the significant post-2020 greenhouse gas reduction commitments by the US and China, the prime minister said he was “not focusing on what is happening in 16 years’ time” but rather on what his Direct Action scheme might achieve straight away. Australia will have to unveil a similar post-2020 commitment next year.  Citing Abbott’s reaction, the Labor leader said: “I fear it will not be long before this stubborn isolationism takes a toll on our international competitiveness.” In a speech to the Sydney Institute, he said it was impossible for Australia to “expect the rest of the world to do the heavy lifting on greenhouse gas pollution, while ignoring our inaction”. “Sooner rather than later, Australia’s refusal to act on climate change will affect our trade negotiations. I would not be surprised if future international trade agreements included a carbon-price equivalent as a mandatory condition.” And he attacked Abbott’s insistence that the G20 is not an appropriate forum to discuss climate because it should focus on economic issues. Asked about Australia’s reluctance to discuss climate at the Brisbane meeting, despite the urging of many other G20 countries, Abbott said; “There are lots of venues to deal with climate change … there’s a conference coming up in Lima which will be a climate change conference. There’s a conference coming up in Paris next year which will be a climate change conference. The UN is a forum which is regularly dealing with climate change – that’s as it should be.  “But this is a major economic conference; it is the world’s premier economic conference. And I certainly expect that the focus will be on economic reform, economic growth, how we drive growth and jobs.” But Shorten pointed out that the US and Chinese presidents had used Apec – also an economic forum – to make their climate policy announcement. And he accused the Coalition of “abandoning internationalism” when it suited its political agenda. “It is not good enough to say yes to Iraq, but no to action on Ebola,” he said. “It is not good enough to say yes to free trade agreements, but no to global action on climate change. It is not good enough to attack the unemployed, yet ignore tax havens.” Australia has been resisting a last-ditch push by the US, France and other European countries for G20 leaders at next week’s meeting in Brisbane to include climate change on the leader’s agenda for discussion, and to back contributions to the Green Climate Fund. The prime minister has previously rejected the fund as a “Bob Brown bank on an international scale” – referring to the former leader of the Australian Greens. The fund aims to help poorer countries cut their emissions and prepare for the impact of climate change, and – along with national greenhouse reduction pledges – is seen as critical to securing developing-nation support for a successful deal on reducing emissions at the UN meeting in Paris next year. As reported by Guardian Australia, Australia has reluctantly conceded the final G20 communique should include climate change as a single paragraph, acknowledging that it should be addressed by UN processes. Australia’s original position was that the meeting should focus solely on “economic issues”. An early text read “We support strong and effective action to address climate change, consistent with sustainable economic growth and certainty for business and investment. We reaffirm our resolve to adopt a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the United Nations framework convention on climate change that is applicable to all parties at the 21st conference of the parties in Paris in 2015.” This has been further negotiated by officials in the leadup to the weekend meeting. Australia had previously insisted the G20 should discuss climate-related issues only as part of its deliberations on energy efficiency, but the energy efficiency action plan to be agreed at the meeting, revealed by Guardian Australia, does not require G20 leaders to commit to any actual action. Instead it asks them to “consider” making promises next year to reduce the energy used by smartphones and computers and to develop tougher standards for car emissions."
"An executive from a mining company has been interrupted during a speech to a G20-related energy forum in Brisbane by protesters chanting “we don’t want your coal”. Glenn Kellow, chief operating officer of the American company Peabody Energy, which was reprimanded in August by the UK’s advertising regulator over a “misleading” public relations campaign, was speaking at an event on Wednesday promoting the use of coal.   But Kellow, who credited Peabody’s campaign with prompting 500,000 people to lobby G20 leaders on the issue of “energy poverty”, was interrupted by activists from the Australian Youth Climate Coalition. “Peabody, we don’t want your coal. Peabody, you don’t belong at G20,” they chanted before voluntarily leaving. Peabody, which is the world’s largest privately owned coal miner, sponsored the event, titled “Growth engine: capitalising on energy’s full growth potential”. It was part of a “thought-leadership forum” to coincide with G20. Earlier, a coalition of religious leaders issued a statement critical of Peabody’s role in a fossil fuel lobby “resisting the call for change” on energy policy. The Australian Religious Response to Climate Change (ARRCC) said the lobby in Brisbane was “actively promoting the message that fossil fuels are an indispensable necessity if developing countries wish to lift their people out of poverty”.  Rabbi Jonathan Keren-Black said this was a “biased claim from an industry that is fighting for its own survival”. Anglican Bishop Stephen Pickard said some G20 leaders claimed to be “people of faith, yet their collective failure to act on climate change is morally reprehensible”. Kellow omitted climate change when speaking of some of “the most pressing” issues to be discussed at G20, instead listing “economic growth, global poverty, geopolitical insecurity and endemic threats”. He said “access to energy plays a vital role in addressing each of these issues – which challenge deserves the most urgency depends on individual perspective”. “We must acknowledge that each fuel has inherent strengths and challenges but that we will need all forms of energy … renewables, nuclear and fossil fuels, with oil, gas and coal playing an important role,” he said. Kellow said there would be “more wind, more solar, more gas, and yes, more coal”.  Peabody’s “advanced energy for life” campaign was found to be “misleading” by the UK’s Advertising Standards Authority because its use of the term “clean coal” could allow reductions in air pollution to be confused with those in carbon dioxide emissions. AYCC organiser Kirsty Albion said Peabody’s publicity campaign – which comes at a time of stalling growth and greater regulation in its home US market – was “a laughable and desperate exercise from an outdated industry”. AYCC joined 30 other youth climate activist groups worldwide to issue an open letter to G20 leaders to “resist the voice of the coal lobby”. “We are compelled to write this letter because we believe that the coal lobby, led by Peabody Energy, is trying to unduly influence the outcome of the G20 Summit,” it reads. “They claim that their industry will benefit the world’s poor. But we know that the rapid expansion of the industry will cost those living under the poverty line their health and clean air – and they are also the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.”  US energy analyst Matt Rogers, who also spoke at the forum, told Guardian Australia that present progress towards a sustainable future energy mix worldwide was like being “in the first hour of a five day cricket match”. “But on every analysis, coal has a long term future,” he said, citing both the cost of early adoption of renewable technology and increasing efficiency of coal fired power."
"Since its creation in 2006 the UN-supported Principles of Responsible Investment (PRI) has become a driver for sustainability in the global investment community. Its 1,300 signatories, from 53 countries, manage over £45tn of assets – around a fifth of the world’s capital – and it has enabled investors to use their influence to improve corporate behaviour on issues such as water risks and climate data. But despite this success the PRI must move further and faster to truly accelerate the growth of responsible investment and create a more just, sustainable world.   Next week the initiative will elect new members to its main governing body, an election in which I’m standing as a candidate, and this election must mark a new focus for PRI, moving from awareness-raising towards measuring and maximising impact. Proving fiduciary duty and sustainability can work together The priority for the mainstream investment institutions that the PRI is aimed at will always be their duty to deliver an appropriate level of financial returns. However in areas such as shareholder engagements we have seen many examples of where fiduciary duty and positive social or environmental impact go hand-in-hand. In 2013 my firm, Boston Common Asset Management worked with a $3tn coalition of investors to reform worker safety in the clothing supply chain after the tragic collapse of the Rana Plaza factory. As a result, Adidas joined other companies in a binding commitment to the Bangladesh Accord on Building and Fire Safety. This both protects investment returns and creates lasting change for employees. We have seen similar results in other sectors too. In pharmaceuticals, GlaxoSmithKline responded to investor pressure by re-thinking its business models to try to fit the healthcare needs of emerging and frontier markets, which has opened up new growth opportunities while providing more access to medicines to people in need.  This September Statoil ASA reacted to an investor engagement by shelving its multi-billion dollar oil sands project, Corner, which would have produced over 770m metrics tonnes of CO2 and might have put investor capital at risk. What needs to change? Investors now have a growing range of tools at their disposal to enable them to measure and increase their environmental, social or governance (ESG) impacts. These include sustainability-focused indices and benchmarks, an ever-increasing body of ESG research across different asset classes, global support for investor stewardship and more ESG disclosure from companies.   Wherever possible the PRI should help its signatories to quantify ESG impacts. For example, the Environment Agency Pension Fund in the UK has measured the carbon footprint of its active public equity portfolio since 2006 and reduced it by 16% in five years (pdf). In the US, pension fund CalPERS has measured how over three-quarters of companies that it has targeted have adopted majority voting systems (pdf) – allowing share owners to have an effective voice in director elections. The PRI’s recent Montreal carbon pledge is a great step in the right direction as it encourages investors to measure, disclose and reduce their portfolio carbon footprints.  Similarly, the process to create new UN Sustainable Development Goals next year, replacing the Millennium Development Goals, is a unique opportunity for investors to ensure that responsible capital markets are directly connected to poverty alleviation and environmental protection. PRI already has an initiative working to bridge the gap between the UN, governments and investors and more work in this area can ensure investors understand how their investment decisions impact sustainable development.  Finally, PRI must move into new emerging and frontier markets, welcoming local investors and learning with them the best way to ensure capital market activity creates long-term sustainable development and social justice in these parts of the world. Putting $45tn to good use Our current financial system has created much opportunity and growth. However it is also at the centre of market failures and encourages behaviour that has jeopardised entire species and the planet. Investors can no longer afford to stand by as uninformed, disengaged, passive financial market participants.

"The announcement by Barack Obama and Xi Jinping of an agreement to limit greenhouse gas emissions is a fine illustration of the difference between the real and ostensible functions of international summit meetings like the G20. Ostensibly, the G20 leaders were supposed to agree on a plan to increase the rate of growth of GDP by two percentage points for the next five years. As an aspirational statement of what might happen given a perfect alignment of the economic stars, such an estimate would be highly optimistic. It would imply, for example, a doubling of the rate of growth in income per person for developed countries like Australia.  As a policy goal, to be achieved by specific measures agreed at the G20 meeting, the target is about as realistic as establishing world peace or ending poverty. The G20 policy agenda is a grab bag of second-order measures (the most substantive is spending 0.5% of GDP on infrastructure) that might marginally increase the long-term rate of economic growth but will have no perceptible impact over the next five years. That’s assuming if the G20 leaders can manage to push them through. All of the measures have been on the wishlists of various policy players for years, so the fact that they aren’t already in place suggests that they face big political or institutional obstacles in the countries concerned. By contrast, the US-China agreement on climate change is the real deal and illustrates the real function of events like G20. By bringing the leaders of 20 or more major countries together in one place, G20 facilitates one-on-one or small group meetings between them, either to respond to immediate crises (Abbott and Putin) or to announce the finalisation of negotiations that have been going on behind closed doors for months (Obama and Jinping). Substantively, the deal is the most important in the long and tortured history of international climate negotiations. This bilateral deal, along with the recent unilateral commitments of the European Union, encompasses more than half of the world’s carbon dioxide emissions and the great majority of emissions from developed countries. It now seems highly likely that most countries meeting at Paris in 2015 will bring commitments to substantial mitigation of emissions. Of the two commitments, China’s promise to reach peak carbon emissions by 2030 at the latest is the most significant. With emissions in most developed countries already falling, offsetting rising emissions elsewhere, this means that global emissions will peak around the same time. The US commitment to accelerate reductions in emissions, reaching a level 26 to 28% below 2005 levels in 2025 is important for a couple of reasons. First (although comparisons are problematic), it puts the US ahead of the EU, historically the leader in the transition to a decarbonised economy. Second, the fact that Obama could announce with reasonable confidence is an indication that the economic costs will be low, and that the necessary policies can, if necessary, be implemented without Congressional assent. The commitments made so far leave the world with just enough time to stabilize atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases at 450 ppm. But there is every reason to think that, once these goals are achieved easily, more ambitious goals will be set. The remaining question is that of the holdouts: significant emitters who have made no commitment, or no adequate commitment, to rein in their admissions. India is the most important, and has legitimate objections to any deal that would require it to hold emissions permanently below the levels of richer countries. But there are many mechanisms, from technology transfer to a global allocation of tradeable carbon credits, that would permit wealthier countries to bear most or all of the costs of decarbonization in India. Japan, which is still dealing with the sudden closure of most of its nuclear power stations following the Fukushima disaster is another special case. If a substantial portion are restarted, and the recent expansion of renewables is continued, Japan should be back on track before long. If this can’t be done, Japan could buy credits to finance emissions reductions elsewhere (from India, for example). That leaves two rich countries whose governments have simply chosen to shirk the task rather than promote change in their economies: Canada and Australia. Canada has withdrawn from the Kyoto Protocol, while Australia has offered only a 5% reduction in emissions relative to 2000 levels by 2020. It is hard to believe that this position can be sustained in the face of the US-China agreement. The government remains officially committed to reductions of 15 to 25% if the world as a whole reaches an ambitious agreement, and it will be very difficult to argue that this goal has not been achieved, at least in broad terms. The formal G20 meeting will go ahead as planned, with lengthy discussions and a forgettable final communique. But the real action has already taken place."
"The Australian prime minister, Tony Abbott, has stood by his defence of coal, saying it is the foundation of Australia’s foreseeable future, just days after a United Nations climate report called for an urgent reduction in carbon emissions. “For the foreseeable future coal is the foundation of our prosperity. Coal is the foundation of the way we live because you can’t have a modern lifestyle without energy,” the prime minister said on Tuesday.  “You can’t have a modern economy without energy and for now and for the foreseeable future, the foundation of Australia’s energy needs will be coal. The foundation of the world’s energy needs will be coal.” Abbott said coal increased the prosperity of people in developing countries.  “If we are serious about raising people’s living standards in less-developed countries, if we are serious about maintaining and improving living standards in countries like Australia we have to be serious about making the best use of coal.” Last month at the opening of a coalmine in central Queensland, the prime minister warned against the “demonisation” of fossil fuel. “Coal is good for humanity, coal is good for prosperity, coal is an essential part of our economic future, here in Australia, and right around the world,” he said.  On Sunday the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released a synthesis report that brought together findings from climate working groups containing scientists from around the world. It said governments must act now to reverse the impacts of climate change. “Continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long-lasting changes in all components of the climate system, increasing the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems,” the report said. It said greenhouse gas emissions were at an 800,000-year high, which puts Earth on track for a 4C temperature rise. It said the cost of switching to cleaner energy was much less than the cost of climate change, and refuted claims that fossil fuels were good for developing countries, saying the poor would suffer the consequences of a volatile ecosystem. “Climate change will amplify existing risks and create new risks for natural and human systems. Risks are unevenly distributed and are generally greater for disadvantaged people and communities in countries at all levels of development,” it said. The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, urged business people on Monday to “reduce your investments in the coal- and fossil fuel-based economy and [move] to renewable energy”. “Science has spoken. There is no ambiguity in the message,” he said. “Leaders must act. Time is not on our side.”"

"This one was trotted out most recently by the treasurer, Joe Hockey, who said he welcomed the US-China climate deal because “the United States and, in fact, China both have direct action plans”.  “I might’ve missed it ... but I don’t recall either the president of China or the president of the United States saying they were going to introduce a carbon tax,” he told the ABC. This myth – accepted by many in the media – confuses the actual point of comparison between different countries’ climate policies – how much they reduce greenhouse gases – with the domestic policies by which those countries choose to do it. If you define “direct action” as any policy to reduce emissions that isn’t a trading scheme it could include any regulation, or subsidy – covering ones that have a real chance of cutting greenhouse gases, like Barack Obama’s power plant regulations and ones that most experts think will struggle, like Australia’s “reverse auction” emission reduction fund. Suggesting that any kind of policy that isn’t a market is equally effective just because it isn’t a market – without considering its merits – is not only weird for a liberal politician, it’s also patently silly. Most modelling exercises suggest this is in fact unlikely, but Australia is at least in with a better chance because the job keeps getting easier before Direct Action has even started. In 2012 the promise to reduce emissions by 5% of 2000 levels by 2020 was calculated to require the cumulative reduction of 755m tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Last year new government calculations reduced that figure to 431m tonnes. Now calculations by Frontier Economics say the figure could be as low as 225m tonnes, if the renewable energy target stays in place to drive investment into clean generation, or somewhere around 300m tonnes if the government succeeds in paring back the RET. Official figures are soon likely to confirm this drop. Whether we meet the 5% target or not, the real problem with Direct Action has always been that it doesn’t prepare the economy for the deeper cuts that must inevitably follow after 2020 – the ones the US and China have just promised to make and that Australia is going to have to make by next year. Making deeper cuts only using the “emissions reduction fund” will be prohibitively, ridiculously expensive. This point was made succinctly by Malcolm Turnbull in 2010 after he was deposed as Liberal leader, when he said direct action-style schemes were “a recipe for fiscal recklessness on a grand scale” and would be “a very expensive charge on the budget in the years ahead”. The “blue book” prepared by the Treasury for a possible incoming Coalition government in 2010 made the same point, saying “a market mechanism can achieve the necessary abatement at a cost per tonne of emissions that is far lower than alternative direct-action policies”. Even more bone-headed than the previous myths, this was advanced most succinctly in recent days by Liberal National party senator Ian Macdonald, who famously wore a hi-vis “Australians for Coal” vest in the Senate chamber, and who said in a statement on Friday: “China emits 24% of the world’s carbon emissions. The US emits 15% of the world’s carbon emissions. Australia emits less than 1.5% of the world’s carbon emissions. When the US and China get down to our level of emissions then we should join their plans. Until then, we should compete with the US and China in trade and local jobs terms by doing what we and the previous government both committed to and that is reducing our 1.4% of global emissions by 5%.” It is true that the US and China are the two biggest emitters in the world, and therefore critical to a successful international agreement – which is why Wednesday’s announcement was so important. But it is also quite obviously true that no international agreement will ever be possible if countries like Australia opt out forever, which is what Macdonald is effectively suggesting. The senator also falls for another of the myths … Before the election Abbott and the environment minister, Greg Hunt, repeated a Coalition commitment to increasing Australia’s emissions reduction target by a minimum of 5% rising to 25% under specific conditions for global action set down in 2009 and accepted by both major parties. The range of targets and conditions under which Australia’s target would be raised above 5% were repeated by Hunt in the Australian Financial Review in which he wrote “the Coalition is committed to a target of a 5% reduction in emissions and the conditions for extending that target further, based on international action”. In a speech to the Grattan Institute thinktank Hunt said “we also accept, and we gave support to the government for the targets, not just the 5% but also the conditions for change ... we accept the targets, clearly, categorically, absolutely”. And Abbott stated the Coalition’s commitment in a letter to former prime minister Kevin Rudd in December 2009, subsequently released under freedom of information laws, in which he requested information on the costs of the proposed emissions trading scheme, but also wrote “the Coalition’s position of bipartisan support for emissions reduction targets – subject to the conditions that were earlier outlined – remains unchanged”. But since the election, Abbott insists he never promised anything other than 5%. Whether or not 5% is a “fair share” of global emission reductions for Australia is debatable. If you adjust the starting years to allow for a fair comparison, it is broadly comparable with the US. But when the independent Climate Change Authority (which the government would like to abolish but hasn’t been able to yet) analysed the question, it found the conditions set down in 2009 had been sufficiently met for Australia to treble its 2020 target to 15%. This astonishing argument was advanced by the prime minister on Thursday in response to the US and Chinese president’s announcements. “It is all very well to talk about what might happen in the far distant future but we are going to meet our 5% reduction target within six years. So, we are talking about the here and now ... We are talking about the practical; we are talking about the real. We are not talking about what might hypothetically happen 15, 20, 25, 30 years down the track,” he said. Actually, they made 2020 commitments as well, and did stuff to meet them. This is about what Australia will do after 2020, which we need to announce by early next year and well in advance of the UN conference in Paris next December, so not in the far distant future. That pressure is even more intense after the US and Chinese announcement of their post-2020 targets. And contrary to the argument advanced by Greg Sheridan in his article snappily entitled “US-China emissions caper won’t change a thing” where he argues the announcement doesn’t “actually require Beijing to do anything for a long time in the future”, shifting to a low emissions economy takes time and meeting a target in 10 or 15 years’ time requires changes to start now. That’s the whole point of the negotiation. There’s plenty of room to analyse whether the US and Chinese pledges require adequate greenhouse reductions, but suggesting that they should be “taken with a pinch of salt” because the target years are in the future misses the point of having target years. Carbon capture and storage is in fact the only way the world will be able to continue using coal-fired power in the long term, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and it is a key part of the US-Chinese agreement. You would think this would make it a priority for any Australian government, especially one that believes “coal is good for humanity”, and that would bear a similarity with the China-US announcement. But in the budget the government cut $459.3m over three years from its carbon capture and storage flagship program, leaving $191.7m to continue existing projects for the next seven years. (The program had already been cut by the previous Labor government and much of the funding remained unallocated.) And the coal industry has “paused” a levy on black coal producers, which was supposed to build a $1bn industry fund to also finance research and demonstration into clean coal technology. It cited low coal prices for the halt. Some $250m has been spent from the fund on demonstration plants and a further $46m worth of grants are under assessment. The objectives of Coal21, set up in 2006, have also been changed to allow the industry to use funding already collected to promote the use of coal. Its constitution now allows money to be spent on “promoting the use of coal both within Australia and overseas and promoting the economic and social benefits of the coal industry”. About $50m has been set aside for “energy literacy”, but only a small amount has been spent."
"Brisbane airport has rejected an advertising billboard depicting a farmer calling for action on climate change on the grounds that the issue is “too political”. Environment and development groups had sought to place the billboard in the airport’s arrivals hall in time for the G20 leaders’ meeting in two weeks time.   Linked with a social media campaign, it originally said “Action on climate change is #onmyagenda, Dear G20 leaders please put it on yours” a reference to Australia’s resistance to having climate change on the G20 agenda at all. The groups then agreed to remove the words “Dear G20 leaders” – leaving the billboard to read simply “Action on climate change is #onmyagenda, please put it on yours”.  But according to WWF chief executive Dermot O’Gorman, media buyer Ooh Media replied that the airport was still rejecting the billboard, which features South Australian farmer David Bruer, “because they consider climate change as being too political”. Another billboard, with the same message, featuring firefighter Dean McNulty, will be erected on the route leaders are likely to take to the site of the G20 meeting. “The #onmyagenda partners were surprised by the decision to reject the billboard. The reality is climate change is a global problem affecting economies, societies and environments all around the world, we can’t afford to sweep it under the carpet, we owe it to future generations to deal with it right here, right now,” O’Gorman said. Bruer, who owns a vineyard in South Australia, told Guardian Australia he was “surprised more than anything else”. “They say climate change is political. Actually it is a reality for farmers like me,” Bruer said. He lost $25,000 worth of grapes in one day last year when the temperature reached 46 degrees C. Australia has reluctantly conceded that climate change can be included in a single brief paragraph of the G20 leaders’ communique after heavy lobbying by the US and European nations. The government had resisted any discussion of climate at the Brisbane meeting on the grounds that the G20 is primarily an economic forum, but other nations argued leaders’ agreements at meetings like the G20 are crucial to build momentum towards a successful international deal at the United Nations conference on climate change in Paris next year. The final wording of the leaders’ statement after the meeting is still being finalised but it is believed to simply recommit to addressing climate change through UN processes. The outcome – and Australia’s fierce resistance to a discussion of climate change – have been attacked by the leading climate economist Nicholas Stern, who has written for Guardian Australia that the latest “synthesis” report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) should be “high on the agenda” for the G20 meeting. “The G20 is the most effective forum for the discussion of the growth story of the future, the transition to the low-carbon economy. Yet the local politics of a country of less than 25 million is being allowed to prevent essential strategic discussions of an issue that is of fundamental importance to the prosperity and wellbeing of the world’s population of seven billion people,” he writes. Australia has agreed the G20 should discuss climate-related issues as part of its deliberations on energy efficiency, but this also appears to be wrapped up in a general commitment that countries consider taking action in the future on some of a long list of areas where energy efficiency improvements might be made. Groups involved in the advertising campaign include Oxfam, Greenpeace, 350.0rg, WWF, Earth Hour, GetUp, the Australian Conservation Foundation, the Australian Youth Climate Coalition and 1 Million Women. They are encouraging people to tweet G20 leaders asking them “to include climate change as a stand-alone item on the G20 agenda, as it was on the previous eight G20 summits”. Brisbane airport was contacted for comment."
"Republicans promised on Wednesday to use their expanded power in Congress to undermine Barack Obama’s historic deal over carbon emissions with China on Wednesday, claiming Beijing could not be trusted to see through its side of an agreement that would ultimately damage the US economy. The hard-hitting response from top Republicans to the historic deal between the US and China – the world’s two largest emitters – foreshadowed an expected collision with the White House over climate change that looks set to define Obama’s last two years in office and could shape the 2016 presidential elections.   Emboldened by their victory in last week’s midterm elections, which gave Republicans control over the Senate as well as the House of Representatives, the president’s opponents are searching for ways to hobble a bold climate change strategy that Obama’s aides believe could be the legacy of his second term in office. That fight will encompass top-line carbon emissions targets set by White House, rules implemented by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that will reduce pollution from power stations and a looming and totemic decision over the Keystone XL pipeline.  The pipeline is a politically contentious project that the Obama administration has repeatedly delayed. The Keystone pipeline, which would transport crude oil from Canada to refineries on the US Gulf Coast, has become a hugely symbolic proxy for the battle between environmentalists and the corporate energy sector. In a sign of the strength of opposition faced by Obama even within the ranks of his own party, the Democratic senator, Mary Landrieu - who is in the midst of a re-election campaign in Louisiana that has gone to a runoff - took to the Senate floor on Wednesday call for an immediate vote to approve Keystone XL. “You don’t become a super energy power by just wishing it,” Landrieu said, calling on Senate Republicans to help her pass legislation to endorse the pipeline.  She was supported on the floor by other pro-energy Democrats: Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Jon Tester of West Virginia and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota. It was later confirmed that both the House and Senate would hold votes on the pipeline. Other Democrats applauded the US-China deal as an ambitious step that, if implemented, could help to bring about the drastic reduction in carbon emissions required to prevent catastrophic environmental consequences. Republican Mitch McConnell, who is certain to take over as majority leader of the Senate in January, fresh from a decisive electoral triumph in the coal-rich state of Kentucky, said he would make it a priority in the next Congress to ease the burden placed on the energy sector by EPA limits on carbon emissions. McConnell, whose campaign for re-election focused on what he said was Obama’s “war on coal”, is considering withholding funding from the EPA to prevent it from enforcing rules set by the administration. He did not specifically address any such measures on Wednesday but said that “easing the burden already created by EPA regulations” would be a priority for the Republican-controlled Congress.  Those EPA rules, unveiled by the Obama administration in June last year, will require carbon pollution from power plants to be cut by 30% from 2005 levels by 2030. The limits led the groundwork for Wednesday’s deal in which China agreed to cap emissions for the first time and the US committed to deep reductions by 2025. The deal was welcomed by climate change campaigners across the world as an important step ahead of efforts to reach a global deal on reducing emissions beyond 2020 at a United Nations meeting in Paris next year. The deal challenges Republicans in Washington because it undercuts one of their principal arguments against restriction on greenhouse gas emissions: that unilateral action by the US handicaps economic competition China, which is the world’s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases and refuses to play by the same rules. Building on the momentum from the China deal, Obama hopes to reach a global deal on reducing emissions beyond 2020 at a United Nations meeting in Paris next year that his Republican opponents will almost certainly oppose. McConnell has already signalled he will use Republican control of the Senate to put pressure on Obama to approve Keystone, but after Landrieu’s brinkmanship on the Senate floor on Wednesday, Democratic leaders in the Senate agreed to schedule a vote. The move would deprive McConnell from claiming responsibility for the much-anticipated vote on the pipeline and, more significantly for Democrats, would be a boost to Landrieu, facing an uphill battle to hold on to her seat in a December runoff election. A Keystone vote would be an acknowledgement that Republicans will almost certainly pass a vote to approve the pipeline in January, and throw a raft to Landrieu, who has used her position as chair of the energy committee to lobby for the pipeline to be approved. Beyond Keystone, Obama’s plans to act on climate change are particularly objectionable to Republicans because it relies solely upon the powers invested in the executive. After becoming president, Obama sought to deal with climate change through Congress, but Republican opposition made that highly unlikely. Ever since he has focused on the considerable range of actions his administration can take independently of Congress. A flurry of other EPA announcements are expected in the weeks and months ahead. Yet without a two-thirds majority of both chambers of Congress, Republicans are unable to force Obama’s hand on Keystone or override the EPA rules that they argue would be particularly harmful in states like Kentucky.  The fight against the deal is likely to be led in the Senate by Jim Inhofe, the Oklahoma senator who is in line to become chairman of the Senate environment and public works in January. Inhofe, a longstanding climate change denier who recently said global warming was a hoax, described the US-China deal as “non-binding charade”. He added: “As we enter a new Congress, I will do everything in my power to rein in and shed light on the EPA’s unchecked regulations.” Under the secretly negotiated deal unveiled by Obama and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in Beijing, China, which previously had only ever pledged to reduce the rapid rate of growth in its emission, will cap its output by 2030. Additionally, it has also promised to increase its use of energy from zero-emission sources to 20% by 2030.  John Boehner, the Republican speaker of the House, said the deal was “job crushing” and added: “It is the latest example of the president’s crusade against affordable, reliable energy.” The deal also involves the US going further than it had previously pledged. It doubles the pace of US carbon pollution reduction – from 1.2% per year from 2005 to 2020, to 2.3% to 2.8% from 2020 to 2025. Inhofe said the deal held the US to a different standard. “It’s hollow and not believable for China to claim it will shift 20% of its energy to non-fossil fuels by 2030, and a promise to peak its carbon emissions only allows the world’s largest economy to buy time,” he said.  Appearing on the Senate floor later, Inhofe added: “Even if they agreed to reducing emissions, we wouldn’t believe them.”  Dismissing the global push to cut emissions, he said “people are trying to resurrect” the notion that there’s “actually some truth to the global warming thing”. Obama’s top advisers said the deal was significant. “To put it plainly, this is a big deal,” said John Podesta, counselor to the president, who oversees climate change and energy policy. “This target keeps us on track to reduce our carbon pollution on the order of 80% by 2050, and means the US is doing our part to keep global temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius.” Podesta is widely tipped to play a key role in Hillary Clinton’s expected bid for the White House in 2016. A future Democratic president is unlikely to object to the targets inherited from the Obama administration, but a Republican president would not feel so tightly bound to them. With the exception of New Jersey governor Chris Christie, whose apparent position on climate change has veered over time, the views of potential Republican candidates range from scepticism about the scientific evidence of man-made climate change to outright denial of its existence."
"Pope Francis has called on G20 leaders to be “examples of generosity” in meeting the needs of refugees, while also taking action against inequality and environmental attacks. In a letter to the Australian prime minister, Tony Abbott, who is hosting the G20 summit in Brisbane this weekend, the pope emphasised the need for efforts to curb climate change, eliminate the root causes of terrorism and prevent financial system abuse.  Australia is determined to ensure the main focus of the G20 is on growing global economic growth and has resisted calls to include climate change as a substantive agenda item. The pope told Abbott the G20 preparatory work highlighted “the fundamental imperative of creating dignified and stable employment for all”, but he urged leaders not to forget that many lives were at stake behind the political and technical discussions. “Throughout the world, the G20 countries included, there are far too many women and men suffering from severe malnutrition, a rise in the number of the unemployed, an extremely high percentage of young people without work and an increase in social exclusion which can lead to criminal activity and even the recruitment of terrorists,” the pope said in the letter released by the Vatican on Tuesday. “In addition, there are constant assaults on the natural environment, the result of unbridled consumerism, and this will have serious consequences for the world economy.  “It is my hope that a substantial and productive consensus can be achieved regarding the agenda items. I likewise hope that the assessment of the results of this consensus will not be restricted to global indices but will take into account as well real improvements in the living conditions of poorer families and the reduction of all forms of unacceptable inequality. “I express these hopes in light of the post-2015 development agenda to be approved by the current session of the United Nations assembly, which ought to include the vital issues of decent work for all and climate change.” The pope referred to “the terrible backdrop of military conflicts” and called for “an ever broader agreement which can lead, through the United Nations legal system, to a definitive halt to the unjust aggression directed at different religious and ethnic groups, including minorities, in the Middle East”. “It should also lead to eliminating the root causes of terrorism, which has reached proportions hitherto unimaginable; these include poverty, underdevelopment and exclusion,” the pope said. “It has become more and more evident that the solution to this grave problem cannot be a purely military one, but must also focus on those who in one way or another encourage terrorist groups through political support, the illegal oil trade or the provision of arms and technology. There is also a need for education and a heightened awareness that religion may not be exploited as a means of justifying violence.” Military conflicts left “deep scars” and resulted in unbearable humanitarian situations around the world, the pope said. “I take this opportunity to ask the G20 member states to be examples of generosity and solidarity in meeting the many needs of the victims of these conflicts, and especially of refugees,” he said.  The pope also called on G20 leaders to protect citizens from other “forms of aggression” including “abuses in the financial system such as those transactions that led to the 2008 crisis, and more generally, to speculation lacking political or juridical constraints and the mentality that maximisation of profits is the final criterion of all economic activity”. “A mindset in which individuals are ultimately discarded will never achieve peace or justice,” he wrote. “Responsibility for the poor and the marginalised must therefore be an essential element of any political decision, whether on the national or the international level.” The pope said he invoked “divine blessings on all taking part” in the Brisbane summit “and on all the citizens of the G20 countries”. He told Abbott: “With this letter I express my appreciation for your work, prime minister, and I offer my prayerful encouragement for the deliberations and outcome of the summit … I offer you my prayerful best wishes for the successful conclusion of Australia’s presidency and I willingly assure you of my highest consideration.”"

"Energy secretary Ed Davey has warned that the Conservative party’s opposition to onshore wind turbines risks undermining the creation of British jobs as new data showed 15,400 people are now employed in the wind power industry. The data from trade body RenewableUK shows a 70% rise in jobs in the wind power industry since 2010, while wind supplied 9% of all UK electricity. The industry attracted £2.6bn of investment in 2013-14, of which £1.1bn stayed in the UK.  But Davey said that the Conservative party’s “ideological” opposition to onshore turbines was undermining new British jobs and driving up customer bills because wind is the cheapest clean energy. “We have had a major leap forward in recent years and there is a really good story to tell,” Davey said. “But I want to be clear I am having a go at the Conservative party here. It has made it clear onshore wind is something they don’t want to see in the future expansion of low-carbon energy and I think that is undermining investment now and undermining jobs.” The Tory communities secretary, Eric Pickles, has called in more than 50 windfarm planning applications for his adjudication and in October Davey said his cabinet colleague was in danger of “abusing ministerial power”. “This political noise we keep hearing is undermining investor confidence in onshore wind and having a contagion effect in renewable energy more generally,” Davey said. “Anyone who undermines investor confidence in Britain should explain themselves,” he said. “Our economic recovery is vital for British jobs and our prosperity and I hope people who put that at risk for ideological reasons will get punished at the polls.” Davey said the prime minister, David Cameron, was committed to the UK’s carbon emission targets, but that blocking windfarms would hurt energy bill-payers: “If you take onshore wind off the table, which we know is the cheapest large-scale renewable, then you are going to increase people’s energy bills.” According to RenewableUK, full-time jobs in the commercial British wind industry rose 8% in the 12 months to June 2014. “That’s a growth rate that most other sectors can only dream of – renewables is the employment engine of the future. However, this growth is threatened with extinction by the Conservatives’ misguided policy of ending all future support for it. The Tories are way out of step with the two-thirds majority of the public which consistently supports onshore wind,” said Maria McCaffery, chief executive of RenewableUK. Tom Greatrex, Labour’s shadow energy minister, also attacked the Conservative opposition to wind power. “We have mounting evidence that Pickles is engaged in a crusade to subvert and undermine the planning process and local decisions in pursuit of his party’s economically illogical anti-renewables dogma. We now have an effective backdoor ban on onshore wind in the UK. The Tories need to wake up and realise they are hurting British industries and British jobs,” said Greatrex. Earlier in November, the Conservative environment secretary, Liz Truss, moved to curb the growth of solar power farms, which she described as a big problem. The latest information on jobs in the wind power industry came as the Conservative energy minister, Matthew Hancock, prepared to announce a £1.5m initiative to establish a national college for onshore oil and gas. “Shale gas is an enormous opportunity for the UK and one that we simply can’t afford to miss out on,” he said. “Only by arming people with the skills they need to be shale specialists can we provide career opportunities for thousands of young people and help the UK economy remain strong and competitive.” RenewableUK also reported that windfarms generated £18m in community benefits and contributed £6m to local councils through business rates in 2013-14. Davey said that a supply chain initiative with the business department aimed to increase the proportion of the investment spent in Britain. The green economy employs almost a million people in the UK, more than teaching, and in 2011-12, the last year the government collected the statistics, was worth £128bn, or 8% of GDP. In 2012, John Cridland, director general of the CBI, said if the government untangled the “gnarly mess” of its policy a green business boost could increase the growth rate of the UK economy by 0.5% by 2015, a gain of nearly £20bn in GDP."
