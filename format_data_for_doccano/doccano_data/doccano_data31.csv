"Doreen Auciello, 63, was finishing a continental breakfast in a hotel in Daytona Beach, Florida – home of the famous speedway races. As she sat with her good friend Gene, who recently lost her husband, their conversation and that of everyone else in the room revolved around Hurricane Dorian, just offshore.  Floridians are used to dealing with hurricane season. It’s hard to deny that the storms are getting stronger, although there is plenty of disagreement as to why. Scientists have been warning that warmer ocean temperatures and higher sea levels are expected to intensify the hurricanes’ impacts. Auciello is retired and lives alone. Her 1967 vintage mobile home, which she bought for $8,000, is all she owns. She knows it could suffer damage and she has no insurance. “No one would insure a 1967 mobile home,” she said. “I don’t know what I’m going to do if it’s destroyed, I’ll be homeless.” She came to Daytona to be close to her sister and indulge in the idea of Florida being paradise. “Florida is like the dreamland. Until you’ve gone through a major hurricane, you don’t know what it’s really like here,” she said. She accepts the facts of the climate crisis. “It’s just not the same as the years go by, all of these storms are just getting worse and worse. Nobody is really taking it seriously and it’s way too late now. You can’t reverse it – the damage, you know.” Auciello had lined herself up a coffee, an orange juice and a strawberry smoothie to get through the day. Regardless of the widespread news coverage of how vulnerable the state is to storm damage, the dream endures: it’s estimated that more than 900 people move to Florida every day. Dorian’s eye was approaching Daytona Beach on Wednesday but the Carolinas now expect the brunt of the storm. Stacy Givens, a Daytona local, believes God is trying to tell us something. “He’s shaking up the world,” she exclaimed, as rather terrifying waves surged up to the sea wall. Rather than a climate crisis spurred by human action, Givens thinks the increasingly frequent monster hurricanes are all part of a divine plan. Many residents on the adjacent barrier island decided not to evacuate. “[The hurricanes] are what they are, they’re going to come whether I’m here or not. I can’t afford to move anyplace else,” said 52-year-old Jim Bordain. He came to the beach to look for any special washed-up shells, which, he said, appear every time a hurricane comes. Like those of many Floridians, his views on climate science can best be described as conspiratorial. “Organizations that want to have control over other people are trying to make more out of the global warming so that they can dictate how business is run and how we use our vehicles,” Bordain explained. Florida is a transient place. People often come to escape their past lives or to seek a comfortable retirement. James Bagwell, 41, has lived in Daytona Beach since 2011. He remodels homes and is struggling financially with being out of work for five days. He thought Dorian was “taking too long” to play out. As the storm paused, catastrophically, over the Bahamas on Labor Day, nerves were fraying in north-east Florida. “I have a little bit of money set aside for emergencies, but not enough for more than five days,” Bagwell said. He sees this extreme weather as part of the cycle of life. “It’s probably nature. If you look at the dinosaurs, they were wiped out by something,” he says. “Maybe it’s close to the time for humans to be wiped out by something and start the next evolutionary ladder.” According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), five of the 10 strongest Atlantic storms have occurred in the last 10 years. Yet many citizens of Florida are confused when it comes to the origins of hurricanes, and how the human-caused climate crisis is steadily making them more dangerous. Florida has a long political history of climate science denial, which culminated in the former governor Rick Scott, now a US senator, allegedly banning the words “climate change” from any internal government communications. Scott is evolving, however. Now, an unwelcome serving of reality is being delivered to those in power, and it’s becoming increasingly hard to sustain the delusion. The Florida senator Marco Rubio, a sharp skeptic in the past, has called recommended actions in scientific reports are “alarmism” but now admits that climate change is a “real problem”. As a result of these policymakers and their predecessors, the Sunshine state still gets far more of its power from burning coal and natural gas than from renewables, and mass transit systems have struggled to gain traction. But the ever-stronger hurricanes and rising seas affect everyone, regardless of political persuasion, so the center ground of the discussion is finally shifting, forcing even science deniers to make statements acknowledging global heating is happening. The recently elected Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, has hired the state’s first chief resilience officer. Her job is to “prepare Florida for the environmental, physical and economic impacts of climate change, especially sea-level rise”."

==============================
There’s little doubt among the many cooler skeptic heads that the global climate change movement has gone off the rails in terms of sanity, and continues to do so in a spectacular fashion.
The madness has arrived.
The latest example is presented to us by Ryan Saavedra of the Daily Caller. One of AOC’s constituents hysterically claims that eating humans, as suggested by one Swedish professor, isn’t going to cut it when it comes to rescuing the planet. Her solution:
“We need to eat the babies!”

One of Ocasio-Cortez's constituents loses her mind over climate change during AOC's townhall, claims we only have a few months left: ""We got to start eating babies! We don't have enough time! …  We have to get rid of the babies! … We need to eat the babies!"" pic.twitter.com/uVmOnboluI

First, if I were a policeperson, I’d certainly would look to see if that insane woman might be missing any kids, or if her neighbors are missing any – seriously. If not, that poor woman needs psychiatric care very quickly.
One thing we note when we scan the faces in the crowd, is that they don’t show even an inkling of happiness at all. They are all frozen in depression, frustration and anger. If you’re in a good, happy mood, then standing less than 30 seconds in that room will change that. The hysterical woman shows that things are progressing from depression and anger to insanity.
How can people allow themselves to be talked nto depression, and later a level of insanity put on display by Ms. Baby-Eater?
It shouldn’t surprise us that when people like Greta and the lunatic media spread all the panic and fan the flames of irrationality, it’s just a question of time before those already on the fringes start falling off the deep end and potentially become a real danger.
Ms. Baby-Eater herself likely used to be one of those depressed, angry faces in the crowd. Then enter Greta and the media.
It’s also astonishing that AOC fields the question and comments as if it were a legitimate one. She should have simply just called the woman’s rant for what is was: utter lunacy. But then again, we live in times where very-late term abortions are okay!
I suspect this is just the beginning. Never underestimate the potential of human insanity, especially when it’s claimed to be backed by “science”. History is filled with such monumental tragedies.
It’s time to take the kooks out of the solution-making and handing that responsibility over to cooler heads.

Image Source: Zhai et al., 2019
Back in 1989, the United Nations issued a dire warning: either reverse the ongoing global warming by the year 2000, or “entire nations could be wiped off the face of the Earth by rising sea levels” and “coastal regions will be inundated“.
The U.N. specifically referenced Bangladesh’s looming fate, forecasting coastal flooding will dispace 23 million Bangladeshi people.
Now, forty years later, we can assess the effect global warming has had on Bangladesh.
From 1985 to 2015, not only did the coastal regions avoid inundation from rising sea levels, Bangladesh’s coastal land area grew at a pace of 7.9 km² per year during this span!

Image Source(s): AP News (1989) and Ahmed et al., (2018)
The trend in stable or growing coastal land area amid rising seas has not just been limited to Bangladesh. Indeed, the overall expansion of coastlines for both islands and mainlands has been global in scope.

Between 1985 and 2015, for example, satellite observations indicated the world’s coasts gained 13,565 km²  more land area than they had lost to the seas. This surprised scientists, as they “expected the coast would start to retreat due to sea level rise,” but instead they observed “coasts are growing all over the world.”

Image Source(s): Donchyts et al., 2016 and BBC (press release)
An analysis of 709 islands from across the globe revealed that no island larger than 10 ha (~25 acres) – which includes the “vulnerable” Maldives, Tuvalu, Fiji, etc. – has decreased in size since the 1980s. In fact, 89% of islands assessed are stable or growing.

Image Source: Duvat et al., 2019
A new paper assessing the area of 15 Florida Bay islands between 1953 and 2014 finds 12 of the 15 grew in size during this timespan, which is consistent with the global trend.
The authors are keen to point out that much of this expansion can be attributed to heavy mangrove forest growth. They apparently don’t view mangrove expansion as a positive development (an “unhelpful resiliance”) due to the tendencies for mangroves to crowd out non-mangrove habitats.
Regardless, Zhai et al. (2019) adds to the growing body of evidence indicating rising seas haven’t been the inundation disaster threat they’ve been made out to be for the last 40 years.
Zhai et al., 2019
Remote sensing of unhelpful resilience to sea level rise caused by
mangrove expansion: A case study of islands in Florida Bay, USA
“To estimate the resilience influences on 15 islands in Florida Bay (Florida, U.S.), our study used indicators (areas of the 15 islands and their mangrove forests) by analyzing 61-yr high-resolution historical aerial photographs and a 27-yr time-series of Landsat images.”
“Comparative spatial analysis of the historical aerial images showed that the island area significantly increased from 1953 to 2014. For example, Joe Kemp Key had the largest area increase from 0.34 km2 to 0.37 km2. Moreover, the similar increased patterns of island area were found for annual total areas of the 15 islands from 1984 to 2011 by analysis of Landsat images. The total areas showed a significant increasing pattern with time. Therefore, results from the analysis of both aerial and satellite images revealed increases in island area, which indicate the island resilience to inundation caused by SLR. However, three islands […] decreased in area.”
“The long-term island area increases estimated by our analysis supported the resilience of Florida Bay islands to SLR inundation. Moreover, both the positive relationship between the increases of island area and mangrove expansion, and previous field studies in the Florida Bay and nearby Caribbean mangroves suggested the contribution of the mangrove expansion were at the expense of non-mangrove habitats.”

Image Source: Brown et al., 2019
This new paper  is an expansion of the research conducted by the same lead author in 2011 (Brown et al.). Brown and colleagues concluded a growth in coral cover is positively correlated with rising sea levels. The authors further suggest “the overall picture for these shallow coral reefs is a positive one” due to rising sea levels and rapid recovery rates.

Image Source: Brown et al., 2011
Another new study (Zinke et al., 2019) indicates there is no correlation between coral growth rates (calcification, skeletal density) and long-term (since 1910) changes in sea surface temperatures. In other words, a regional warming trend in the tropical Atlantic has not been associated with a decline in coral cover.

Global warming alarmists like to claim that tropical storms will intensify and become more frequent unless people stop using fossil fuels.
And recently these alarmists have had our attention steered to the Atlantic basin, where tropical storms this year have seen quite an active season thus far.
Another reason the focus has been on the Atlantic is because very little has been happening in terms of Pacific typhoons, and the alarmists don’t want to talk about that.
In fact this July is the first July to have seen no typhoons formed in the Pacific at all since statistics on this began in 1951, according to the data from the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA).

Data source: JMA, here and here. 
Normally between 3 to 4 typhoons form in the Pacific in July. Up to 8 have formed in the past, e.g. on 2017 and 1971. But this year July failed to see a single typhoon form – the first time this has occurred since 1951.

Trend contradicts the forecasts of climate scientists
But one year does not make a trend. Global warming alarmists say storms are getting and will be more frequent, and stronger. So let’s look at the data here as well.
The following chart shows the number of typhoons formed in the Pacific each year from January to July, since 1951:

Data source: JMA, here and here. 
Contrary to what global warming alarmists say, the trend has been downward! The year 2020 has been the second quietest on record – so far.
A warmer world is tamer?
Now we look at total number of typhoons formed each entire year:

Data source: JMA, here and here. 
Once again the global warming alarmists are shown to be wrong. In fact, it’s probably the other way around: A warmer planet leads to less storm activity. But this is not the message the purveyors of fear want us to hear.

"Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise despite the Morrison government claiming it is taking “sensible, responsible action” to address the climate crisis, the latest official data shows. National emissions increased by 3.1m tonnes in the year to March to reach 538.9m tonnes, a 0.6% jump on the previous year, the report released on Friday revealed. Carbon dioxide emissions from electricity generation continue to decrease, reflecting the falling cost of solar and wind energy, but this is being more than cancelled out by the growth in emissions from the liquefied natural gas (LNG) export industry, mostly in northern Western Australia. Emissions from LNG were up 4.7m tonnes over the year. The report, published by the environment department, does not include a graph that shows the change in annual emissions over time, preferring instead analyses that suggest Australia’s carbon footprint is improving based on per capita and per dollar of GDP calculations. The graphs below are independently derived from the official data. Total national emissions have increased each year since the government abolished a national carbon price in 2014. The increase in emissions according to official data was not as great as forecast by the private emissions-tracking organisation Ndevr Environmental, which suggested electricity emissions had started to increase again. The emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, said emissions fell by 0.4% in the March quarter compared with the previous quarter. Taylor said if LNG exports were excluded Australia’s emissions would have declined by 0.3% over the year and stressed the economic benefit of the LNG industry. Gas exports increased by 18.8% last year and were estimated to be worth $47.8bn. Taylor also repeated his claim that Australia’s LNG emissions have the potential to cut global emissions by up to 152m tonnes a year by replacing coal for electricity generation in parts of Asia. As the Guardian has reported, this figure is based on a back-of-envelope calculation and not an analysis of whether gas is being used to replace coal. The evidence that is available suggests gas is often not replacing coal. The government’s office of the chief economist last month advised that in Japan, Australia’s biggest LNG market, gas is increasingly competed with zero-emissions nuclear and renewable power. The report shows emissions increased in most parts of the economy. They were up from stationary energy (including manufacturing, construction and commercial sectors), transport, fugitive emissions from coal seams and natural gas production, industrial processes, the waste industry and land use including forestry. They were down in electricity generation and agriculture, the latter mostly due to a decline in livestock caused by the drought. Labor’s climate change spokesperson, Mark Butler, said the increase in emissions was no surprise given the government’s plan to address it was to spend another $2bn on the “failed” emissions reduction fund introduced under former prime minister Tony Abbott. He said government projections showed emissions were expected to increase until 2030 under current policies. “Australians have come to expect this from a government that is not serious on taking real action on climate change,” he said. Greens climate change spokesperson, Adam Bandt, said Australia was “on a collision course with climate disaster”. “When excluding unreliable land use data, it is the highest twelve months of pollution in Australia’s history,” he said. Matt Rose, an economist with the Australian Conservation Foundation, said burning coal and gas was the main driver of the climate crisis and Australia was now the number one exporter of both. He said Australia’s stance was completely inconsistent with the global energy transition needed to meet targets met at the 2015 Paris summit. “The federal government will need to explain to the world how it intends to meet its Paris targets when the international community meets in New York in September for the UN secretary-general’s summit on climate action,” he said."
"This year marks the 200th anniversary of the birth of Eunice Foote, a pioneer in climate research of whom few people have heard. She showed that water vapour and carbon dioxide helped to heat Earth’s atmosphere, and realised that when the atmosphere had higher levels of carbon dioxide it made the climate much warmer.Her work was presented in August 1856 at a prestigious scientific conference in the US, but had to be given by a male colleague because women were not allowed to give talks at the meeting. Her study was not even included in the conference proceedings, although a summary of the talk appeared in a report about the meeting a year later.In 1859, the renowned physicist John Tyndall, working in London, demonstrated how certain gases such as carbon dioxide and water vapour in the atmosphere warmed the climate – what later became known as the greenhouse effect. He made no mention of Foote in his research and whether he did not know of her work or deliberately ignored it remains unknown. But Tyndall’s experiments became widely accepted as a cornerstone of work on the greenhouse effect. Despite Foote’s insights, her contribution to climate research became a footnote in history and is only now starting to come to light.  "
"Many early pictures of towns and villages that survive in archives were taken when snow was covering streets and roofs. Even considering the obvious attractiveness to photographers of snow scenes these many images must mean such snowfalls were fairly commonplace. In this century many places in the south of the UK would be hard put to capture such picturesque scenes again because it rarely snows, and then melts within hours.  Even more striking are the occasional archive pictures of hoarfrost. One Victorian picture of a local church with the branches and twigs of trees turned white by the frost brought back memories of waiting for the school bus, aged five, and wondering if my fingers might freeze and snap off before it arrived. In Norfolk everything, trees, houses, even the bus stop were covered in white crystals – not snow but frost. The temperature had not risen above freezing for days. The fact that this rarely happens now is borne out by new research published in Geophysical Research letters that show that so-called “cold” days in European winters are on average 3C warmer than 70 years ago. In the UK this makes it far less likely that temperatures will remain below freezing all day, a prerequisite for hoarfrost to build up so everything is white. "

Share this...FacebookTwitterFundamental tenets of the CO2 greenhouse effect hyphothesis aren’t supported by real-world, observed evidence. 
Image Source: Kennedy and Hodzic, 2019
I. CO2 warms the planet by 7.2°C?
According to the IPCC and other sources, when CO2’s atmospheric concentration ranges between 0.03% and 0.04% (300-400 parts per million, or ppm), it literally warms the air by 7.2°C within the Earth’s 33°C greenhouse effect.

Image Source: Boersema and Reijnders, 2009
Problematically, at no time has it been empirically demonstrated in a real-world experiment that CO2 warms air by this temperature at this concentration. (Or any concentration.)
CO2’s capacity to warm air by 7.2°C is an non-validated assumption derived from the arbitrary estimation that CO2’s warming influence contributes about 20-25% to the Earth’s 33°C greenhouse effect.
II. Lab experiments using CO2 as a causal variable fail to demonstrate its warming effect
Classroom lab experiments that use pure (1,000,000 ppm) CO2 in one container and air (N2, O2) in another to demonstrate the CO2 container warms more than the air container are only illustrating that CO2 molecules are heavier than nitrogen and oxygen molecules.
Heavier CO2 molecules “reduce heat transfer by suppressing convective mixing with the ambient air” (Wagoner et al., 2010).
In other words, the CO2 molecules aren’t warming the container via their radiative properties, but due to the density differential for CO2 relative to N2 and O2.

Image Source: Wagoner et al., 2010
Another experiment (Allmendinger, 2016), again using pure (100%) CO2 in a container, compared the radiative absorption properties of CO2 to that of argon, helium, and air (nitrogen and oxygen).

Surprisingly, Dr. Allmendinger found that the capacity to absorb radiation (sunlight) was quite similar for CO2 and for argon, nitrogen, and oxygen. The latter 3 are non-greenhouse gases.
Nitrogen and oxygen together constitute 99% of the atmosphere. Argon’s atmospheric representation is 0.93% (9,300 ppm) and CO2 is 0.041% (410 ppm).
In the experiment, pure CO2 was used. And the limiting absorption temperature for pure CO2 molecules wasn’t significantly different than the far more atmospherically abundant non-radiative gases.
As Allmedinger summarizes, this means that “a significant effect of carbon-dioxide on the direct sunlight absorption can already be excluded.”

Image Source: Allmendinger, 2016
III. Scientists insist the CO2 greenhouse effect is built on assumption and lacks empirical support
In a new paper, Kennedy and Hodzic, 2019 summarize the lack of real-world, observational support for the claim CO2 molecules elicit planetary heating in the process of explicating their postion that water vapor is the gas that dominates the Earth’s greenhouse effect.
They point out that the “critical assumption” that CO2 molecules reduce outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) to warm the Earth’s surface “lacks empirical confirmation.”
A graphic of OLR variability (Figure 1) from the paper demonstrates that “none” of the variation can be attributed to CO2’s influence.
Kennedy and Hodzic sum up their skepticism about CO2’s greenhouse effect influence by saying 1) “the effect of any increases in [CO2’s] concentration can only be theoretically inferred”; 2) other than by correlation or curve-fitting, there is no  “direct verification possible for the greenhouse effect of CO2”; and 3) there is no realized “clear spectral signal available showing significantly reduced OLR from increasing CO2.”
In other words, the specific greenhouse effect warming properties of CO2 have not been validated scientifically.

"Kimberley Mullings has seen a lot of hurricanes. In 2016 the roof of her family’s home, in Grand Bahama, was torn off by Hurricane Matthew. But she has never experienced anything like Hurricane Dorian. “There is no way you can compare this to any storm I’ve been through before,” she said over the phone from Grand Bahama, where she is holed up at her mother’s house waiting for the storm to pass. “The wind speed is ferocious. It’s vicious, that’s the only way I can describe it. You can’t sleep because you don’t want something to happen to you in your sleep.” Dorian has the strongest landfall wind speed of any Atlantic hurricane on record and crashed across the island of Grand Bahama, east of Florida, more than 24 hours ago before settling over the island. As of the early hours of Tuesday morning, it had not moved for more than 12 hours, meaning for that entire time the same communities had been lashed relentlessly by winds of up to 155mph (250km/h), enduring storm surges of up to 5.5 metres (18ft) above normal tide level. “Think about one of your worst nightmares and that there is nothing you can do,” said Mullings, 27, who lives in North Carolina, but travelled home to be with her mother and niece when she heard about the storm. “There is nothing you could have done to have prepared for a storm like this.” Her family did what they could to prepare for Dorian’s arrival. They have a generator so still have electricity, though their water has also been cut off. They have provided shelter to 12 people, including family friends. They put down sandbags and tied down anything they thought could have become a missile. Even with all all these preparations, they are still not sure if their home will bear up against the unprecedented winds. “We’ve seen trees snap, literally snap,” said Mullings. “We’ve seen pots with plants that are really heavy – 80lbs [36kg] – moving. We have seen cars crash into each other because of the wind speed and the flooding.” Despite their garage being classified as being able to withstand hurricanes, she can hear and see it flex in the wind. “You know how you breathe in and out, imagine a door coming in and out like that. We can see that, we can hear it. We have hurricane impact doors and windows and we can still see the blinds move. The doors are shut, these lock in five places … they’re properly insulated and they’re still moving.” Mullings is lucky. Her home is in one of the few parts of Grand Bahama that hasn’t experienced flooding. She has friends who live in two and three-storey homes on the island, where the water has risen so high they have been forced to wait out the storm in their roof spaces. “Some of them have babies, newborn babies, children, who are in the roof with them. Their entire families are waiting it out with them. Some of them are wet.” Several shelters, including one for people with special needs, have been compromised, she said, forcing people to take shelter in the hospital, which she has heard has also experienced serious flooding. “The police can’t do anything. Their vehicles are all under water. Fire trucks are under water. It’s a pretty scary situation to be in. No one can come to help and you can’t leave to get anywhere.” Mullings is already thinking ahead to what this hurricane, the latest in a run of devastating storms, will mean for the Bahamas. “I have great concerns about what it means for the country moving forward,” she said. “Every time we try to make a comeback we have another storm.” For now all she, and the other 52,000 people on Grand Bahama, can do is wait for Dorian to finally move on."
"Australians are increasingly concerned about droughts and floods, extinctions and water shortages associated with climate change, and most people think all levels of government aren’t doing enough to combat the effects of global warming, according to new research. The annual Climate of the Nation survey, which has been tracking Australian attitudes to climate change for more than a decade, finds concern about droughts and flooding has risen from 74% of the survey in 2017 to 81% in 2019. Concern about climate-related extinctions – an issue highlighted dramatically in May when a major scientific report warned that a million species across the world faced extinction – has risen from 71% in 2017 to 78% in the 2019 survey, while concern about water shortages, an issue front of mind as a consequence of Australia’s prolonged drought, has increased from 67% to 78%. Public sentiment about phasing out coal has also shifted in the past few years. In 2017 65% of the survey thought coal power stations should be phased out gradually to help manage the costs of the transition, but the percentage has dropped to 52% in 2019. The percentage of people believing the shift from coal to clean energy needs to be accelerated, even if the transition costs more in the short term, has increased from 19% in 2017 to 26% in 2019. There has also been an increase in the percentage of people in the survey arguing that Australia should completely end coal-fired power generation within the next 10 years. In 2017 30% of the survey agreed, and in 2019 39% agreed. In Queensland – where the future of coal was a significant issue in the May federal election – 49% of the sample thought coal power stations should be phased out gradually and 24% said as soon as possible. • Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Just over half the national sample, 51%, said they would support a moratorium on new coalmines (including 49% of Liberal voters and 53% of Labor voters). While parliamentary Nationals are the most vocal supporters of the coal industry, the survey suggests their voting constituency is split, with 48% supporting a moratorium, 40% opposing it and 12% undecided. It’s a similar picture for One Nation, another vocal supporter of coal in Canberra – 41% of One Nation supporters supported a moratorium, 36% opposed one, and 22% undecided. The annual survey, conducted by YouGov/Galaxy, has assessed attitudes to climate change since 2007. The now defunct Climate Institute began the series, and it is now managed by the progressive thinktank the Australia Institute. The survey is national and it has a margin of error of plus or minus 2%. The research will be launched in Canberra on Tuesday by the independent who unseated Tony Abbott in the May election, Zali Steggall, in part on a platform of climate action. “Australians are rightly concerned about more extreme heatwaves, droughts and bushfires and they want the Morrison government to show leadership on climate change and do more to prepare for the impacts that are already locked in,” Steggall said. “This latest report shows that Australians support far more ambitious climate and energy policies than the federal government is currently delivering.” The 2019 survey found that 77% of respondents agreed that climate change is happening (equal to the percentage in 2016), and 61% said warming is caused by humans. For context, 64% of the sample agreed climate change was happening in 2012, 19% weren’t sure and 17% said it wasn’t happening. Now it is 77% agreement, 11% unsure and 12% said it isn’t happening. Just under half the sample, 48%, said climate change is already causing more heatwaves and hot days – a nine-point increase in a year – and just over half the sample (51%, up from 43% a year ago) thought climate change is behind the melting of the polar ice caps. More than half the sample, 64%, wanted Australia to adopt a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and 56% of the sample wanted Australia to limit global warming to 1.5C. The survey indicates nuclear energy, which has been revived as a prospect by some Morrison government MPs, remains divisive with voters. Only one in five put nuclear in their top three preferred energy sources, and 59% of the survey put nuclear in their bottom three. Breaking down the responses by demographics, women were more worried about climate change than men and, speaking generally, young people were more worried than respondents aged over 55. Looking at perceptions in the city versus perceptions in regional Australia, people in metropolitan areas were more likely to agree that coal plants should be closed and replaced with cleaner alternatives (64% to 55%), and city dwellers were more likely to support a moratorium on new mines than regional Australians (55% to 46%). People in the regions were more aware than their city counterparts that Australia is a signatory to the Paris agreement (62% to 57%) and more likely to blame the energy companies for high power prices (64% to 53%). The climate and energy director at the Australia Institute, Richie Merzian, said of a looming UN climate summit in New York: “The public want to see the Australian government take a leadership role when it comes to global action on climate change.”"

Currently green energy proponents are pushing to significantly ease restrictions against the construction of wind parks, and don’t want to hear any complaints from pesky local citizens. But resistance to projects has reached a massive scale.

Wind turbines welcome only by their developers and operators. German citizens no longer welcome them. Photo: Pierre Gosselin
Across the country people have come to realize that although the produced electricity from wind is CO2 emissions free, the massive environmental impacts the huge industrial contraptions are having on the landscape, regional environment and public health risks aren’t worth it.
Local citizens reject planned local wind park
Today we find another powerful example of how wind projects planned near communities are being overwhelmingly rejected.
Near the North German community of Ovelgönnes, citizens shot down plans to build a wind park comprising four 200-meter tall Vesta 126 wind turbines each with a rated capacity of 3.45 MW, reports the daily Nordwest Zeitung (NWZ).

The generator hub height is planned for 137 meters, close to 200 meters at the tip of the blade.
In mid January, local citizens gathered for an information evening aimed at explaining what the project was about. But as reported by the NWZ, the project proponents were met with “severe opposition” to their plans. The article described the information meeting as “charged with emotion”.
One local resident claimed: “Here personal effort for profits is being placed above the common good.” Another resident accused the project supporters of “putting public health at risk”.
Only 600 meters setback
A preliminary plan by wind park builder Windstrom shows that the turbines would be a mere 600 meters away from the nearest homes and only 1000 meters from the community of Großenmeer, east of the proposed park.

Rejected 269 – 11
The project went to a vote earlier this week, reported the Nordwest Zeitung (NWZ). The result was devastating: only 11 (4%) were in favor of the park, 269 (94%) were against.

"Scott Morrison will not attend the UN climate action summit despite him being in America to visit the Trump administration at the time – deploying the foreign minister, Marise Payne, and the Australian ambassador for the environment, Patrick Suckling, instead. Guardian Australia understands speaking slots at the event in New York on 23 September were reserved for countries announcing new emissions reduction targets or financial commitments to the UN Green Climate Fund – and Morrison has been signalling Australia won’t be going further, at least at this point, than commitments previously announced. A draft program for the summit, and a list of member states intending to present at the event, seen by Guardian Australia, did not include any reference to Australian participation. Morrison was asked by the Greens in question time on Wednesday whether he would attend the UN summit, and he said Australia would be represented at the event. Asked by Guardian Australia to confirm whether the prime minister would be the Australian representative, and whether the government would offer any new commitments, a spokesman for Morrison said: “Australia has already outlined our policies to tackle climate change including cutting our emissions by 26-28% and investing directly into climate resilience projects through our regional partners”. The spokesman confirmed Payne would attend the summit, not Morrison. “The foreign minister, accompanied by the ambassador for the environment, will be highlighting [the Coalition’s previously announced policies] when she represents Australia at the UN Climate Action Summit.” Morrison will go to New York later in the week as part of his US visit to address the UN General Assembly. Guardian Australia reported in July that the UN secretary general, António Guterres, as a prelude to the special climate summit on 23 September, had written to all heads of state, including Australia, asking countries to outline plans to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Morrison at the time dead batted what Australia might do at the UN event, but signalled Australia was only engaging on the process to 2030, not on the next round of commitments to 2050 flagged by the secretary general. Despite well-publicised differences at the recent Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) between regional leaders and Morrison about coal, Australia at the forum signed up to a statement that commits Australia to pursuing efforts to limit global warming to 1.5C, and to produce a 2050 strategy by 2020. Earlier this year, Australian government officials also restated a commitment to “review and refine” domestic policies aligned with the five-yearly review process under the Paris agreement. The Morrison government was challenged by the European Union and by China in June about whether Australia could meet its Paris commitments given the trend of rising emissions evident since the repeal of the carbon price, including increased pollution from vehicles. Australia needs to submit a new pollution reduction goal for post-2030 as part of the “review, refine and ratchet” mechanism under the Paris agreement. In response to questions ahead of a climate meeting in Bonn in June, Australian officials said of refine and review: “This approach will provide for integrated consideration of domestic policy and international targets, and provide guidance for industry about future policy review processes.” While Australia has made a commitment at PIF to develop a 2050 strategy next year, Morrison has made it clear the Coalition won’t be investing more in the UN climate fund, and will instead pursue investments in climate resilience directly with Australia’s regional partners. Morrison’s spokesman said Australia was pursuing direct investments because countries in the region had faced “frustrations with the UN’s Green Climate Fund”. Morrison at PIF offered $500m over five years from 2020 from existing aid funds for climate projects. Britain has been confirmed as the host of the COP26 meeting in December 2020. That meeting at the end of next year under UN auspices is regarded as the most important on the climate since the Paris process, because parties to the Paris agreement will review their pledges. The British government has privately appealed to senior Coalition ministers – including the energy minister, Angus Taylor, and Payne – to develop a more “ambitious” climate policy, amid growing concern that Australia is not doing enough to cut emissions. While the criticism of the government’s current policy offering on climate change is persistent from a range of stakeholders, Morrison declared in parliament on Wednesday Australia had no case to answer. “We are doing our heavy lifting. We are setting our targets. We are meeting our targets. We have the programs in place.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn these times when legitimate, qualified and alternative voices and opinions on science are being snuffed out by the mainstream and social media, e.g.: on issues related to the Corona lock down and the causes behind climate change, many worry that our fundamental rights are being infringed.

“I’ve been called on to save you!” Führers like claiming they represent overwhelming “consensus”, the Association of German Historians warns. Image: Science Skeptical
The Association of German Historians (VHD, Verband der Historiker und Historikerinnen Deutschlands) has issued a statement on “Current Threats to Democracy“, warning against populism.
The scientists at the German Die kalte Sonne site here noted, however, the often claimed “97% consensus” in climate science “sounds despicable and reminds us of the election results of autocratic regimes”. How does science actually work and how does democracy work?”
To shed some light on this, here’s what the Association of German Historians writes on its website:

For parliamentary democracy and a pluralistic culture of debate, against populism

In pluralistic democracies, public policy is the result of open debates in which a variety of political opinions and social interests are expressed. A unified will of the people that can be discerned by those regarding themselves as ‘called’  is, in contrast, a fiction, used by people in political debates primarily for the purpose of making themselves invulnerable. In the Weimar Republic, the idea of ‘the people’s will’ smoothed the way to power for a movement whose ‘Führer’ saw himself as the incarnation of that will.
[…] Also, in light of colonial violence committed by Europeans in other parts of the world, it is crucial to acknowledge our shared responsibility for the consequences of our policies in regions outside of Europe.”
Of course this message is aimed at the White House and to other capitals that aren’t popular with the European elitist establishment nowadays. Unfortunately, these warnings need to be heeded by the elitist European policymakers and activists the VHD likes to laud and defend. Lately European mainstream media, elitists and activists have been insulting and slandering experts who have come forward to express dissenting views.
In Germany climate and lock down dissenters – who are in fact experts – are routinely slandered as “deniers”, charlatans”, “right-wingers”, crackpots – or worse.
The grave consequences of baseless fear
Meanwhile, the fake-science-based “climate crisis” – resulting from am authoritarian shutdown of “open debate” and opposing opinion – is already having grave consequences on our youth.

"Being arrested in the Italian port of Lampedusa drew a lot of media attention on me personally this summer as a young woman and a sea captain whose vessel, the Sea-Watch 3, had rescued 40 people from the Mediterranean and taken them to safety. My arrest came after two weeks at sea attempting to secure a political solution so we could legally land these refugees from the civil war in Libya. My ship entered Italian waters despite an order from Matteo Salvini, the far-right interior minister, so in the media I became the woman who defied the right in Italy and Europe.  I’m still under investigation by the Italian authorities (although a judge overturned my arrest because I was trying to save lives) but am I worried? Honestly, no, because my actions were justified. What I’m really scared of is the damage we are doing to our planet, and the hostility that may be unleashed against those fleeing drought, famine, fires and storms. To me, the dangers of climate breakdown and the need to help those trying to cross the Mediterranean are intimately linked. A lot of people are understandably worried about discussing the links between migration and the climate crisis, fearing it will lead to more xenophobia and even tougher border policies. The thing is, this xenophobia and these hard border policies are already here. I have seen them with my own eyes, in the people I’ve pulled from the sea – and in those I was too late to save. Climate breakdown exacerbates the reasons people already have for needing to migrate, such as desperate socioeconomic conditions or political oppression. In situations where people already struggle to survive, climate breakdown intensifies the pressure, whether through rising sea levels, water shortages, storm damage or crop failures. People living in the most disadvantaged places on Earth – who have contributed the least to the climate crisis – are also the first to face its effects. The devastating storms in Mozambique, the droughts in Somaliland that have killed most of the livestock, and the heatwaves in India are just a taste of things to come if we continue to pump greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. More and more people will have to move just in order to survive. In the next few decades, millions will be forced to migrate to avoid ever-changing, ever-worsening environmental conditions. So far most of them are migrating internally, from rural to urban areas, or are moving to neighbouring countries. Only a handful travel longer distances. They are then stranded in front of the walls of countries that are often in part responsible for the conditions – both environmental and political – that they are fleeing. The global north conquered and plundered during its colonial heyday, and still holds those countries hostage for debt, but it is also now depriving people of life’s necessities through its own addiction to high-carbon luxury. Yet we are seeing a rise of rightwing rhetoric across rich nations. This has terrible consequences for those affected, whether it is people taking their own lives in Australia’s notorious Manus and Nauru detention centres, dying in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody on the US-Mexico border, or drowning in the Mediterranean – right now the world’s deadliest border. Politicians justify these horrendous conditions on the grounds that they will deter more people from coming. But the numbers of migrants and refugees who keep coming suggest that this strategy is not working. Of course, not all migration is linked to climate breakdown, but the climate emergency will make any “migrant crisis” we have now look like a tea party. A report by the UN special rapporteur on poverty and human rights warned recently of a future “climate apartheid”, where the global poor will suffer the worst consequences of climate breakdown while the rich buy their way to relative security. “Human rights might not survive the coming upheaval,” the report concludes gloomily. My greatest fear is that this dystopian vision of our future may come true. That the erosion of human rights was already well under way was very clear to me in Italy. What the Sea-Watch crew and I did was a relatively small thing. A moment of solidarity with those facing an immediate threat to their lives. It’s only as an afterthought that I would agree to call it symbolic. It shows the hypocrisy of the EU’s stance on migration, but also states boldly what kind of future we want: a future of global equality, solidarity and justice. Working on polar research vessels, I have seen the effects of global heating on nature first-hand. But while volunteering for Sea-Watch, I’ve seen a glimpse of what the future could hold for millions – even billions – of people. There are always those who either manufacture disaster or take advantage of it to gain wealth and power. The climate crisis will cause disasters that could help tyrants and fascists seize the reins. We need to do what we can to stop them from getting a foothold in Europe. It is not enough for Europeans to applaud those who challenge the Fortress Europe ideology. We will not change anything through passive support – we must all be active in demanding and creating the future that we want. Join activist movements to demand action on climate breakdown. Reduce your personal carbon footprint – dramatically. Help migrants and refugees already in your country to integrate into your society. Support organisations such as Sea-Watch however you can. And speak up against – and vote against – the politics of hate and division. As a German citizen, I have the privilege of risking arrest without fear of being deported to a dangerous place or being left to drown in the sea. But as a German I have another thought, too. Most of us wonder what we would have done in the 1930s, as racist rhetoric turned into racist policies and, eventually, genocide. My actions with Sea-Watch, I hope, tell me what I would have done had I been alive back then. The question I have for you is: what will you do now? • Carola Rackete is a German ship captain who volunteers for the sea rescue organisation Sea-Watch"

The northern hemisphere surface temperature was expected to drop substantially according to NCEP, but this of course will not keep global warming alarmists from sounding the warming alarms.
But a look at the unadjusted data from some rural US stations tells us that there has been no warming.
Today we look at temperature data from NASA of some stations along the northern US with a Brightness Index (BI) of 0, meaning rural locations with no urban heat island effects. We want to see the trend over the past 100 or so years.
Plotted are the USHCN Version 4 versus Version 4 adjusted.
The first plots are the data from Lincoln, Nebraska going back to 1901:

Modest cooling changed to warming. Data: NASA. 
Note how a modest cooling trend was changed to a warming trend. Very ealy temperatures were cooled by 2°C!
Next we move to the Livingston, Montana station, where here as well a modest cooling trend was transformed into warming by massively adjusting past temperatures downward also by more than 2°C:

Data: NASA
The story is similar for the New Salem, North Dakota station, where earlier temperatures were adjusted downward by more than 1°C in order to produce a meaningful warming trend:

Data: NASA
Moving to the northern US state of Minnesota, we plot the data for the Artichoke Lake station going back over 100 years. Once again the past was cooled by NASA number-crunchers:

Data: NASA
Here an insignificant warming was suddenly amplified to about 1°C per century.
Finally we compare the GHCN unadjusted to the adjusted data at Harbour Beach, Michigan, where we see a slight cooling trend over the past 120 years was changed to a warming trend:

Data: NASA
In summary rural US areas without urban impacts have raw data showing cooling or almost no warming for the past 100 years. But NASA revisions wiped out it out produced a history of warming.

Global warming alarmist scientists like claiming that the well documented Medieval Warm Period (MWP) was mostly a regional, North Atlantic phenomenon, and was not global, and so we just move along and stop questioning man-made global warming.
For example, the online Britanica entry on the Medieval Warm Period written by John P. Rafferty writes that it occurred “predominantly in the Northern Hemisphere from Greenland eastward through Europe and parts of Asia.”
Britanica does state that the claim of a global extent is highly controversial, though it really isn’t as we are about to see.
More than 1200 papers evidence it was global
Indeed the claim that it was global is now backed up by a huge body of scientific studies meticulously compiled by Dr. Sebastian Lüning of Die kalte Sonne and presented at Google Maps here.

Click here to access the MWP Google Map.

The outstanding site presents more than 1200! publications which evidence that the MWP was global.
125,000 visits
So far the site is proving to be a valuable resource as it has been accessed over 125,000 times. Not bad for a project that was financed entirely on a shoestring by small, private donations.
Natural forces at work
When asked about the reaction to this resource, Dr. Lüning replied:
We run this study fully open-minded and without any result that we try to prove. We screen through all available data and then simply let the data talk. We begin to see a connection of the Medieval Climate Anomaly to the long-term changes of the ocean cycles, such as AMO and NAO. The same patterns that are known from the last 100 years (multidecadal) seem to operate on a multicentennial time frame. Most ocean cycles were really just discovered in the 1990s and it is only now that we integrate them into the longterm pre-industrial climate changes as well. By better understanding natural pre-industrial climate change, we may help answer a key question for modern climate change, related to attribution: How much of the warming of the last 150 years is anthropogenic, and how much is natural? This attribution question is certainly not trivial:

Taken as a whole, for the alarmists the 1200+ papers are an extremely inconvenient body of facts and knowledge, so don’t be surprised if efforts are made to make them disappear from the Google platform in the future.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA comment by PhD physicist David Appell, a contributing writer to Scientific American and Nature,  shows he does not understand the fundamental climate-driving mechanism of water evaporation in a recent comment. 

Amazon rain forest still exists despite very warm, year-round temperatures. Image cropped: NASA
Many readers are familiar with climate alarm dogmatist David Appell. He sometimes goes off on comment tirades here at NTZ, getting huffed up.
Though a large part of his dogma-filled comments fail to meet editorial standards, and so don’t get published, some have merit and are welcome.
Doesn’t understand evaporation
Recently I decided to leave up one of his comments, though it was a falsehood. I did so because it illustrates how this Physics PhD really does not even understand the basic physics behind water evaporation – a critical element in our climate system. If you don’t understand how evaporation works, how can you possibly understand how climate works, let alone model it?
Appell’s gaffe comment came in response to the recent NTZ article: “Alarmist Claims Of Increasing European Drought Are A Myth“, to which he commented: 


<!--

Though it may be counter-intuitive to some, Appell’s statement is false. Indeed many laypersons believe that heat (higher temperatures) do dry things out. For example, we throw our wet clothes in the dryer because “the heat dries them”. But it isn’t quite so. Heat is not what dries, and PhD physicist David Appell really should know better. Drying depends on the relative humidity, and not on temperature.
Wet jungles, desert polar regions
According to Mr. Appell’s understanding, hot jungles, where hot temperatures of 35°C persist, should have dried out long ago. But they haven’t. They don’t dry out because of their high relative humidity that keeps them green and lush. It has nothing to do with temperature.
In fact, as reader Yonason points out, some of the largest deserts in the world are located in extremely cold regions. Temperature is not what drives drought! Lack of moisture is what does it, and nothing else. In fact, the driest periods on earth have occurred in cold periods.
Other “experts” also misunderstood
David Appell is not the only “expert” who misunderstand what drives evaporation. German “expert” Volker Quaschning also misunderstood it last year. Veteran Swiss meteorologist Jörg Kachelmann had to sit him down and school him on the subject. It’s no wonder many alarmists and modelers have been so wrong when it comes to climate change.
Lack of quality control
And one really has to pause and wonder about the quality control at renowned publications like Scientific American and Nature, who Appell claims he has written for,  that they would print material from persons who clearly do not understand the fundamental physics of water vapor – a crucial component of our climate system.

By Kirye
and Pierre Gosselin
A few days ago we showed how Antarctica’s coastal stations were in fact cooling somewhat rather than warming. This came as a surprise to many.
And now that it’s June 1st, with the Arctic melt season starting in earnest, it is a good time to check Arctic ice volume. Here as well we find an equally surprising trend. Instead of shrinking rapidly — as is often claimed by the .global warming by alarmist scientists and the click-sleaze media — Arctic sea ice volume has not shrunk in 13 years!


Surprise. Arctic sea ice volume has not fallen in 13 years. Data source: Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI).
As the above chart shows, the ice has in reality even grown a bit!

The figures are based on calculations using DMI’s operational ocean and sea ice model HYCOM-CICE.
This is why today it’s more important than ever to keep the focus on the real data and not the hysterical headlines that currently dominate the hype-filled media.
And when we look at Arctic sea ice volume each year for June 1st this decade and plot it, we get the following:

June 1st Arctic ice volume on June 1st has increased so far this decade. Data: DMI.
Lo and behold: the chart above shows that early June ice volume has trended up over the current decade.
How can anyone say the Arctic ice has been rapidly melting recently? The answer is that they can’t. Anyone claiming otherwise is just plain lying.

"Hundreds of cyclists took part in a staged funeral procession in central London on Saturday before performing a “die-in” near Whitehall to call for greater investment in walking and cycling. The protest, organised by the campaign groups Extinction Rebellion and Stop Killing Cyclists, drew attention to statistics showing that more than 100 cyclists were killed and 3,400 seriously injured in 2016, the most recent year for which figures were available.  Three horse-drawn hearses carrying coffins led the procession from Lincoln’s Inn Fields along the Strand, as signs saying “Asthma”, “Crashes”, “Obesity” and “Climate” highlighted the impact of car travel. A small child’s coffin commemorated the children and adults who have died prematurely from diseases related to air pollution. The 10-minute “die-in” was initially scheduled to take place outside the Treasury, but police asked the activists to congregate next to Trafalgar Square due to a separate, concurrent anti-government protest outside Downing Street. As sombre, pre-recorded funeral music played by bagpipes rang out, protesters demanded an ecological and climate emergency autumn budget with £6bn to be invested in walking and cycling. “Transport is the largest greenhouse gas-emitting sector in the UK,” Caspar Hughes, an organiser at Stop Killing Cyclists, said. “Cycling campaigning is climate campaigning. The die-in is symbolic of all the people who have lost their lives due to traffic violence, pollution and the climate. He said the spending review was “laughable” and criticised what he said was a stark imbalance between investment in cycling infrastructure and the expansion of the road network. Donnachadh McCarthy, the co-founder of Stop Killing Cyclists, said: “With the Arctic and Amazon on fire and tens of thousands of Britons dying from car pollution, it beggars belief that chancellor Sajid Javid is proposing more toxic fossil fuel duty cuts. “The 2019 budget must be a climate and ecological emergency budget that includes £6bn per year for the creation of a national cycling network and the reversal of the toxic fuel duty cuts.” Many of the protesters had cycled into London from elsewhere in the UK. Extinction Rebellion called for “massive investment” in safe cycle lanes, which the group said would help protect children from fossil fuel pollution. Protesters’ other demands included a reversal of fuel tax cuts and the institution of car-free villages, towns and city centres. “If there were less cars and people cycled more, we would all be healthier,” Kelvin Dane, who cycled from Romford, Essex. “Its quite scary when you cycle in London – it’s not everybody’s cup of tea. There’s too many cars on the road, people are too lazy, they use cars for short distances. Its madness. People should just cycle, it’s very simple.”"
"Democrats will pit their climate plans against each other on Wednesday at a seven-hour CNN town hall, as world scientists warn the window is narrowing to prevent catastrophe. With the planet already about 1C (1.8F) warmer than before industrialization, the United Nations’ climate panel says that keeping the increase to 1.5C would require “rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society”. Carbon dioxide emissions in the US and abroad need to fall significantly in the next decade and reach “net zero” by 2050, according to the UN. Without massive changes, rising temperatures will worsen extreme weather, water and food instability, political unrest and poverty. Carbon free means eliminating all C02 emissions from power plants, cars, industry and agriculture. Carbon neutral or ""net-zero carbon"" would allow some emissions to continue as long as there are offsets, such as the planting of trees that absorb heat-trapping gases. Below we assess each candidate’s stance on the climate crisis and also the judgment of outside organizations. Three environmental groups are evaluating the candidates based on their plans and legislative records. Greenpeace assigns a letter grade for ending fossil fuel use and supporting a Green New Deal. Data for Progress tallies which elements of a Green New Deal candidates back. And the League of Conservation Voters ranks former lawmakers based on how they have voted in Congress on environment-related laws. However, some candidates were still releasing plans shortly before the town hall, amid pressure from the Democratic base, as well as school strikers and other protesters. To match what science requires, the next president would need to cut heat-trapping pollution from transportation, electricity, agriculture and land use, battling with Republicans who broadly downplay the crisis and oppose restrictions for industry. Some climate advocates worry Biden would not do enough to eliminate fossil fuels from the US economy. He stumbled over a debate question about whether coal and gas would have a place in his administration, saying “we will work it out” and promising to eliminate subsidies. But his rankings are decent and he has committed to the timeline outlined by the UN climate panel. Warren would spend $3tn over a decade to decarbonize buildings, transportation and electricity, according to a plan released on Tuesday. Her blueprint praises the extensive climate proposals of the Washington governor, Jay Inslee, who dropped out of the race last month. She had previously made pitches for green manufacturing, better land use, a green military and more clean energy research. Transportation produced 29% of greenhouse gas emissions, followed by electricity at 28%, industry at 22%, commercial and residential at 12% and agriculture at 9%, according to Environmental Protection Agency data from 2017.  Invoking the Green New Deal, he has proposed alongside congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Sanders aims to eliminate all carbon emissions by 2050, not just reach “net-zero”. His goal would be harder because it wouldn’t count offsets to climate pollution, like forests that absorb the gas. He would also spend far more than his competitors. Sanders wouldn’t give new licenses to nuclear plants, which currently account for more than half of carbon-free energy in the US. And he is not a supporter of technologies to capture carbon emissions – which scientists say will be necessary for the challenge ahead. Among the candidates, he has the longest history of advocating for radical change to stop the climate crisis. Harris’ plan, released Wednesday, falls between Biden and Sanders in terms of aggressiveness and spending. She would also tax carbon pollution. Most of the energy the US uses comes from oil made into gasoline for vehicles. For electricity production, 35% is from natural gas, 27% is from coal, 19% is from nuclear and 17% is from renewable energy (hydropower, wind, biomass and solar), according to the Energy Information Administration.  Buttigieg’s plan doesn’t specify how much he would spend in total, but his campaign told Vox it could reach around $1.5tn to $2tn. He wants to create 3m clean energy jobs, and he backs a price on carbon with rebates to low- and middle-income Americans. Yang would also tax carbon pollution and use revenues to fund alternative research, upgrade energy systems and subsidize fuel costs for low-income Americans. He says people will have to move to higher ground as seas rise. O’Rourke stops short of calling for a carbon tax, saying he backs a “legally enforceable standard” that will “send a clear price signal” to curb carbon emissions. China produces the most heat-trapping pollution, followed by the US. But historically, the US has contributed more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than any other nation. The US also has high emissions per capita, compared to other developed countries. And Americans buy products made in China, therefore supporting China's carbon footprint.  Booker is largely focused on environmental justice, and calls for the White House to coordinate to protect communities from environmental threats, including lead pipes that have contaminated drinking water where he was mayor, in Newark. He would ban new fossil fuel leases on public lands and spend on massive reforestation and wetlands restoration. He supports a carbon tax with dividends returned to people. Castro wants the whole country – including local governments and private entities – to invest $10tn over a decade to create 10m jobs and transition away from fossil fuels. He wants to cut emissions in half by 2030 and neutralize them by 2045. Klobuchar says she would “take aggressive executive action to confront the climate crisis” and introduce “sweeping climate legislation in the first 100 days of her presidency”. While she sets a goal for the US to be carbon-neutral by 2050, she has said she would not ban fracking for oil and gas and she supports “cleaner coal” technologies, according to Inside Climate News. She has also said she supports a Green New Deal but thinks it is aspirational. "

Solar industry lobby wants to punish climate emergency critics for sabotaging emergency measures
By Kalte Sonne
(Translated/edited by P. Gosselin) 
German public broadcaster Deutschlandfunk on December 25, 2019:
Climate scientist Johan Rockström thinks the declaration of a climate emergency is justified.
Rockström (Potsdam Institute Director):
The declaration of a “climate emergency” would make it possible to make really big decisions. …such as making things possible that are necessary but have not been considered realistic.“
This reminds in the diction of 24 March 1933, at that time the law was officially called: “Law to remedy the distress of the people and the Reich” and it served to abolish the Republic. Isn’t anyone suspicious?
What fits well here is an action of the solar industry lobby, which has made good business from the alleged climate catastrophe. Whoever criticizes the climate alarmism professionally is considered a troublemaker. So it fits in well with the picture that the Solarenergie Förderverein Deutschland e.V. (Solar Energy Association of Germany) is calling for the punishment of critics on its website. The address of the site is: http://sfv.de/artikel/verharmlosung_der_klimakrise_eine_straftat.htm. Here we read:
Wolf von Fabeck calls for punishment for those who trivialize the climate catastrophe:
Trivializing the climate catastrophe endangers the survival of mankind – do we have to accept this?

Why the trivializers cannot hide behind the fundamental right of freedom of expression
They even link to a PIK-alarm paper:
At the suggestion of the Fridays For Future demonstrators, Constance is now the first German city to declare a ‘climate emergency’ – a rather symbolic act – but one that shows what is needed. Mayor Burchardt explained that from now on all decisions to be taken by the city council must be assessed in terms of climate protection. At the same time, he called on the Federal Government to improve the legal framework for climate protection measures.
It is essential to ward off the danger decisively and to the best of our knowledge and belief, not only in Constance, but everywhere in Germany (everyone should first of all put their own house in order), and finally worldwide. In the case of climate catastrophe, the best knowledge is provided by the natural sciences, and not by those who trivialize it. What the trivializers do can be described as sabotage, and sabotage of emergency measures should be punished.”
[…]
A strong democracy must not accept this development. What is missing here is the legal threat of punishment within the Criminal Code – as already mentioned in the summary:
‘Anyone who plays down or denies the climate catastrophe in a way that is likely to disrupt, disparage or completely prevent the defense of the climate catastrophe under the Paris Climate Convention and its follow-up agreements will be punished with a fine of up to 300 days wages. In case of recurrence, the penalty is imprisonment.’
Such a threat of punishment in no way undermines the fundamental right to freedom of opinion. Also the freedom of opinion has, as already mentioned in the introduction, legal limits (Article 5, Paragraph 2, first half sentence German Law). For example, according to Paragraphs 185 to 187 of the German Criminal Code, insult, libel and slander are also sanctioned, because otherwise peaceful coexistence is not possible.”
Emergency laws, sabotage, punishment. This seemingly undemocratic argumentation is not entirely new in Germany. The last time it was heard was 80 years ago.
Note: The German Solar Energy Lobby also remarks:
Note: It is not the misled ones who should be punished, but the disinformers, the instigators, the authors and distributors of the fake news.”

We know people die prematurely of air pollution and it is a major issue, especially in developing countries. But it is essential to understand the difference between air pollution and CO2 emissions.
CO2 is essential to all forms of life and it is difficult for many people to believe the gloomy versions of the AGW theory. So climate alarmists often criticize Japan for using coal-fired thermal power, insisting it is very dirty.  But in fact Japan’s coal-fired smoke emissions are not dirty because they have been properly cleaned using technology.
Japanese climate alarmists don’t like to mention that SOx and NOx emissions from coal-burning plants in Japan are quite low. In Japan, coal power is good and if the world used the same technology, the air pollution problem would be solved in many countries.
Reality to Greta! Do you read?
What follows are charts showing how much sulfur oxide and nitrogen oxide emissions have improved over the recent decades. First we look at nitrogen oxides, NOx:

Data source: OECD
You’ll note that a number of countries have greatly reduced nitrogen oxide emissions in terms of unit GDP.

Even Greta Thunberg’s home country of Sweden has substantially reduced air pollution. Thanks to the earlier efforts of the now older generation, the developed world is far cleaner today, and thus supports the notion that more wealth leads to much cleaner environments. Those who realize this appreciate it and thank you!
Next we present a chart depicting sulfur oxide emissions. The results are very similar:

Data source: OECD
Above we see how industry was much dirtier 30 years ago and how it’s much cleaner today. But does the generation who worked hard to produce this excellent result get a thank you from the younger inheriting generation? Unfortunately not.
Instead the older generation only hear insults from the usual ignorant and petulant ingrates.
Finally we see a comparison chart of the OECD countries for the year 2017:
Data source: OECD
Europeans promoting wood burning!
So what does the younger generation demand we do? For starters they want to stop heating of homes using natural gas. Instead they are pushing for a return of the stinky wood-burning stoves – which they claim are better for the environment!

But Mars has surface temperatures that are about -75°C colder on average than Earth’s because atmospheric density, or pressure, is the “game changer” largely determining planetary temperatures.

Image Source: Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum
Surface temperatures on Mars
The average surface temperature of a planetary body is significantly determined by its distance from the Sun.
According to the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Mars is close enough to the Sun to have its surface temperatures reach 35°C (95°F) at the equator during summer.
During winter, however, the Martian temperature dips to -90°C (-130°F).
The average surface temperature for Mars is about -60°C (-80°F).

Image Source: NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory
Atmospheric composition of Mars vs. Earth
Both Venus and Mars have atmospheres that contain over 95% CO2.
In contrast, Earth’s atmosphere contains just over 0.04% CO2.

Image Source: Space.com
Extreme temperature swings on Mars
While the solar heat reaching Mars can warm its surface by up to 35°C, about 8-11°C (15-20°F) of that incident heat will be lost to space just 1.5 meters from the surface (Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, 2018).
“There might be a 15-20 degree temperature change between where your feet are and where your head is if you were standing on Mars.”
Nights and winters are unfathomably cold, whereas daytime summer temperatures can be similar to or warmer than Earth’s.
As atmospheric scientist Dr. Matthew Shindell points out, the reason for this wide variance in temperature extremes is that “there is little to retain heat on the planet” despite Mars’ 950,000 ppm CO2 atmosphere.

Atmospheric density, or pressure, is the “big game changer”
Mars’ thin atmospheric denisity, or pressure (AP), reaches just 0.006 bar. Earth’s AP is 1 bar. The AP for Venus is 92 bar.

Image Source: ScienceDaily, 2017
Consequently, the Mars, Earth, and Venus surface temperatures average -60°C, 15°C, and 462°C, respectively.
Interestingly, on the summit of Venus’s Maxwell Montes the AP drops from 92 bar to 45 bar. In turn, the surface temperature plummets by -82°C even though the CO2 concentration (96%) is the same at both locations.

Image Source: Universe Today
Mars’ 0.006 bar AP is referred to as the “big game changer” in explaining why its surface is so cold on average. The atmospheric greenhouse gas composition – effectively the same (95-96% CO2) for both Mars and Venus – does “little to retain heat”.
In sum,  a planet’s relative warmth can be enhanced “due to an increase in atmospheric mass” or in its capacity to retain heat (Chemke et al., 2016), and temperatures are cooler if there is “a decline in atmosheric pressure” (Sorokhtin et al., 2007).

Image Source: Chemke et al., 2016

Image Source: Sorokhtin et al., 2007
Does the anthropogenic global warming (AGW) hypothesis have a Mars problem?
Again, despite Mars’ very high CO2 concentration, “there is little to retain heat on the planet”.
This conclusion would appear to undermine the AGW claim CO2 levels are a planet’s temperature control knob.
So the summarizing question is this. Why is Earth’s CO2 concentration of 0.03% to 0.04% considered both determinative and dangerous as a climate control mechanism if (a) relative planetary warmth is largely dependent on atmospheric density and (b) even a 95% CO2 concentration on Mars effectively doesn’t retain planetary heat?

Share this...FacebookTwitterA new 1876-present temperature reconstruction for Northern Finland shows the 1930s were the warmest period of the last 140 years. And there has been no net warming since.
Tree density analysis, MXD, has a “more prominent association with temperature” than measuring tree ring widths because it can more clearly separate precipitation factors affecting tree growth from temperature-limiting factors (Bjorklund et al., 2020).
Northern Finland is characterized as “the most suitable place in the world for temperature reconstruction” because it sits on the edge of where trees can or cannot grow (or survive) due to clearly defined temperature limits on growth. (For example, forests used to extend to the coast of the Arctic Ocean during the Early Holocene, indicating the Arctic region needed to have been 2.5 to 7°C warmer to accommodate such tree growth.)
Pinus sylvestris (29 trees) from northeastern Finland indicate the warmest interval since 1876 occurred in the 1930s, and since then there has been no net warming. This is visible in both tree ring width (RW) and density (MXD) analysis.

Image Source: Bjorklund et al., 2020
Other new “dendroclimatic” studies also show a similar temperature pattern of a warm early/mid-twentieth century and a subsequent cooling in the 1960s and 1970s prior to another warming in the 1990s-2000s. For example, in China, tree ring evidence suggest such a pattern for soil temperatures (Yuan et al., 2020), and Keyimu et al. (2020) find “A.D. 1940–1965 witnessed the longest extended warm period at Big Snow Mountain Scenic Area over the past 180 years”.

Proxy evidence from across the Northern Hemisphere may also show this same warming-cooling-warming temperature pattern. They also show the modern period is not climatically unusual relative to past ~1,500 years (Stoffel et al., 2015, Schneider et al., 2015).

"The former US secretary of state John Kerry has warned that humanity risks marching off a cliff unless governments take immediate action to fight the climate emergency. In a keynote address to the Global Table food and agriculture conference, Kerry made veiled swipes at the Australian government’s lack of climate and energy policy. He also weighed in on the heated debate about the massive Adani coalmine proposed for north Queensland.  “We just can’t sit on our asses and leave the political process to neanderthals who don’t want to believe in the future,” Kerry told the audience in Melbourne. “We have a dearth of leadership, but this will turn.” The former US Democratic presidential candidate said it was not a choice between taking action on the climate emergency and securing jobs and growth. “They are not separate. And anybody who persists in putting forward that notion that you have to make the choice – you can either have jobs plus prosperity or you can protect the environment and the future. That’s a lie. “We’ve got a whole bunch of people running around trying to save the status quo – when the status quo is actually feeding a lot of jobs that don’t make sense.” He said the transition to carbon emission-neutral economies would create better jobs and noted that the fastest growing employment opportunities in the US were for solar power and wind power turbine technicians. He contrasted the growing US solar workforce of 300,000 people with the declining coal workforce of 50,000. Two years ago 75% of new electricity coming online in the US was renewable energy compared with 0.2% coal. “We have to make better choices,” Kerry said. @JohnFKerry, 68th Secretary of State, delivering the opening keynote at Global Table x @SEEDSandCHIPS. Discussing the need for leadership, facts and vision during tough times. #GlobalTableAus #SaCGlobalTable pic.twitter.com/QhV03PNUSB He cast doubt over continued investment in the coal sector, acknowledging the controversy surrounding the Adani coalmine in Australia. “I got to tell you, we should not be moving to coal, we should not be encouraging coal, we should not be building infrastructure around coal,” he said to rousing applause from the audience. He talked up the future of small-generation nuclear power, citing its safe use by the US Navy. But experts have cast doubt on the technology because of cost, technical limitations and its failure to be deployed commercially anywhere in the world. Kerry said people arguing that the cost of action to fight the climate emergency was too great were not factoring in the massive storm and disaster damage bills. In 2017 the category five hurricanes Irma and Maria and the category four hurricane Harvey cost $265bn to clean up. “Wait and see what happens with Dorian,” Kerry said. He likened the money needed for climate action to the scale of the Marshall plan to rebuild Europe after the second world war. The Australian government has resisted calls to invest more cash in the UN’s Green Climate Fund. Australia has previously pledged $200m to the fund to help developing countries adapt to the impacts of climate change and cut their own greenhouse gas emissions. “It’s to help those developing nations leapfrog the mistakes and get modern technology,” Kerry said. “We said we would put $100bn in that fund to help these smaller nations do this transition … But do you know how much money is in that fund? Less than $5bn. Come on, folks, that’s not serious.” He compared the global response to “lemmings marching off the cliff into the sea”. Kerry was critical of the Trump administration’s decision to pull the US out of the Paris climate change action pact but said state governors and mayors across the country were stepping up to the plate. The Global Table conference continues until Friday."

Share this...FacebookTwitterAccording to the German online Tagesspiegel here, retired alarmist climate researcher Prof. John Schellnhuber is open to accepting a minister position in the state government in Brandenburg.
Panic in Germany
The former director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research thinks the planet “is in a sort of emergency” and so he is prepared “to advise the democratic parties concerning overcoming the climate crisis,” he said an interview with the “Potsdamer Neuesten Nachrichten”.


Schellnhuber says we are living in “unusual times”. Germany has pledged to shut down its coal power plants by 2038, which environmentalists and climate alarmists say is too long and that it has to happen much sooner.
As the coal industry is a key energy supplier to the state of Brandenburg, and the current Brandenburg government coalition made up of the socialists and leftists has been reluctant in scaling back coal power, fearing a fierce backlash from coal-related workers.

Earth slipping into a “Hot Age”
Schellnhuber warns, however, that action needs to be taken more aggressively and that “we really don’t have much time left to prevent the earth from slipping into a Hot Age”.
Potsdam recently declared a climate emergency and a citizens’ initiative is demanding that it be declared state-wide, the Tagesspiegel reports.
Schellnhuber also attacked the hard right, climate skeptic AfD Party, which the Tagesspiegel reports “denies climate change”. Schellnhuber says their “climate lies sound seductive because you don’t need to change behavior over the short term.”
Skepticism “endangers our entire civilization”
Schellnhuber calls this type of science skepticism “dangerous because it endangers our entire civilization” and says that in parties like the AfD there are “many bitter old gentlemen” who would lose their importance.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn yet another new paper (Drotos et al., 2020), scientists determine the climate sensitivity to CO2 is “practically zero” the more the concentration rises. A ~4450 ppm CO2 concentration has cooler climates than observed in the pre-industrial (278 ppm) era. Why? A self-amplifying cloud feedback mechanism cools the Earth by magnitudes “as large as 10 K” upon warming saturation.
Earlier this year, scientists published a paper using mesocosms (controlled outdoor experiments) to demonstrate CO2 concentrations of 3200, 7500, and 16,900 ppm are associated with colder temperatures than in outdoor environments with 480 ppm CO2 concentrations.
Now, in another new paper (Drotos et al., 2020), several more scientists are asserting the Earth system has an internal, self-amplifying negative cloud feedback mechanism so powerful that
“at CO2 concentrations beyond four times the preindustrial value, the climate sensitivity decreases to nearly zero as a result of episodic global cooling events as large as 10 K”.
The cooling events spawned by the high CO2 concentrations lead to temperature “drops below the coldest values of the control [278 ppm pre-industrial CO2]” such that the climate sensitivity to CO2 doublings is “practically zero” over time.
“In particular, the climatological mean value of the global mean surface temperature practically stops responding to an increase in the CO2 concentration. This practically zero climate sensitivity suggests that the effect of a feedback on the global mean surface temperature may turn out to be as strong as the radiative effect of CO2.”
In other words, scientists have found yet another way the claimed “runaway greenhouse” response of the climate system to elevated CO2 turns out to be a false alarm.

"These days as a climate scientist, the line of separation between the research I do in my professional life and the events unfolding in the world at large is growing ever thinner. The extreme events that our community has been talking about for decades are now becoming part of our lived experience, season after season, year after year across the entire planet. What we are seeing play out now is much faster than many of us ever imagined. Barely a week after sweltering through an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) lead author meeting discussing the UN group’s sixth global climate assessment report during an unseasonable European heatwave, it’s been surreal to return home to find much of Australia’s eastern seaboard engulfed in unprecedented bushfires crisis. In spring. Right now there are about 80 fires in Queensland and a further 60 blazes raging through New South Wales. The maps show the east coast terrifyingly lit up like a grotesque Christmas tree. Many of these fires are burning out of control as the relentlessly gusty winds ground the firefighting aircraft needed to bring the blazes under control. It is shocking to see such extreme and widespread fire weather conditions so early in the spring. In fact, this year the bushfire season actually started in winter, two months earlier than normal. Most alarmingly, some of these fires are occurring in subtropical and coastal areas that don’t usually burn. Perhaps it shouldn’t come as a surprise, given about 98% of NSW and 65% of Queensland is currently drought affected. Many regional towns like Stanthorpe are coming close to running out of water, having to resort to trucking in supplies to avoid water shortages. And now, even more water is needed to fight the blazes bearing down on regions already struggling with severe drought conditions. Australia’s second-warmest January to August on record has baked the landscape dry, turning usually wet rainforests into fuel under catastrophic bushfires conditions. All of this comes off the back of summer of 2018-2019, which was Australia’s warmest on record. Extraordinarily, we broke the previous 2012-2013 record by a margin of almost 1C, with 206 new records set across the country in 2018-2019. The heat was particularly extreme in NSW, where monthly mean temperatures in January were 5.86°C above average, making it the state’s hottest January on record by more than 2°C. Just to be crystal clear: these record-breaking conditions are all signals of the warming trend we have been experiencing in Australia since the start of the Bureau of Meteorology’s records in 1910. Nine of Australia’s 10 warmest years on record have occurred since 2005, and that long-term trend shows no sign of turning around any time soon. As a scientist, what I find particularly disturbing about the current conditions is that world heritage rainforest areas such as the Lamington national park in the Gold Coast hinterland are now burning. This region of eastern Australia is part of the Gondwana rainforests of Australia, which contains the largest remaining stands of subtropical rainforest in the world, and the most significant areas of warm temperate rainforest in the country. These usually moss-drenched forests are packed with the oldest elements of the world’s ferns, and primitive plant families dating back to the Jurassic era, some 200m to 145m years ago. Although these remarkable rainforests have clung on since the age of the dinosaurs, searing heat and lower rainfall is starting to see these wet areas dry out for longer periods of the year, increasing bushfire risk in these precious ecosystems. It has been hard to watch the news coverage of these exceptionally rare rainforests burning. Just like the dying off of 50% of the Great Barrier Reef, the potential loss of these areas is something I never thought I would witness in my lifetime. The world has justifiably been grieving the recent accelerated destruction of the Amazon, but fewer Australians appreciate our own ecological disaster unfolding on our doorstep. The Gondwana rainforests of Australia are evolutionary relics that have immeasurable conservation value to the global community. If rapid climate change destabilises the cool and wet conditions needed for these ancient rainforests to survive, they may be lost to humanity forever. Although there are natural seasonal fluctuations in the Indian and Southern Ocean that are influencing the dry and windy conditions we are currently experiencing, all of Australia’s weather and climate variability is now occurring in a world that is 1°C warmer than it was since pre-industrial times. The human fingerprint on Australian temperatures has been clearly detected since 1950. This means that all natural variability is now being modified by human influences on the climate system, leading to changes in observed climate variability and extremes. Since the 1970s, there has been an increase in extreme fire weather, and a longer fire season, across large parts of the country. Under the world’s business-as-usual emissions scenario we are currently on, Australia’s average temperature will typically increase 4°C by the end of the century. To be blunt, the catastrophic fire weather conditions we are experiencing now will become increasingly common as the planet continues to warm. It’s clear to me that the extreme events we are experiencing right now in Australia and all over the world, are a sign of things to come. Events that were considered extreme in today’s climate will become average in the future as records continue to be broken and the “new normal” emerges. What we expect to see in our future climate is playing out right now, not decades in the future. As we begin to drift away from the safe shores of historical variability, the only certainty is that life in the “new normal” will be outside the range of human experience. All of this begs the obvious question: what will it take for Australians to wake up to the climate crisis we now face? The harsh reality is that this event is likely to be forgotten once the fires are finally out and the media interest has moved on. Despite being one of the worst bushfires in Australian history, alarmingly, the Victorian Black Saturday bushfires of 2009, which killed 173 people, destroyed around 2,000 homes and incinerated millions of plants and animals, didn’t serve as a wake-up call. The deeper we sink into denial, the more we commit ourselves to a reality where our children learn about environmental icons such as the Great Barrier Reef and our magnificent rainforests through history books, instead of being able to experience their wonder for themselves. Choosing to turn away from this moment to act will be the ultimate betrayal of future generations.

"Teen climate activist Greta Thunberg was joined by swelling and excited crowds of American teenagers at a protest outside the UN headquarters in New York on Friday, in a further blossoming of the youth environment movement given extra thrust by the Swede’s transatlantic boat crossing. Some US children said they were at their first ever climate demonstration; others said they had been passionate about the environment for a while but had been galvanized to act by Thunberg’s rising profile. On Friday afternoon, Thunberg and two young activists were spontaneously invited inside the UN for a meeting with a senior leader, described as “very supportive”. Just two days after Thunberg disembarked from a yacht in New York, following two weeks on rough seas crossing from the UK, young protesters dominated the crowd of up to 1,000 outside the United Nations skyscraper in Manhattan. They came together to demand politicians and older generations take urgent and comprehensive action to reverse the climate crisis. Carrying hand-drawn placards with messages such as “United behind the science” and “Act now or we will”, children and young people of all ages surged into a park in front of the flags of the world outside the UN on Friday morning. Thunberg sat cheerfully but pensively in the middle of the rally, which had a rather more earnest than festive atmosphere. Young speakers gave spontaneous speeches or led chants of “System change, not climate change” and “Don’t just watch us, join us”. Alexandria Villaseñor, 14, who has been protesting every Friday outside the UN since December, was in her usual spot and said she had been inspired by Thunberg’s school strike campaign. She said: “Greta being here will really galvanise students just because of how much of an inspiration she is. Everyone who’s been striking on Friday was really empowered by Greta and the action she was taking.” Thunberg held her trademark “skolstrejk för klimatet” (Swedish for “school strike for climate”) sign, which she was seen carrying from the racing yacht on Wednesday, after refusing to take a flight to the US because of the polluting emissions.  For Dana Henao, 16, from Brentwood, Long Island, Friday marked her first climate protest.  “The government isn’t taking enough action to protect the environment and all they care about is the money they make with corporations polluting the planet and I think we should put a stop to it,” she said. “The young people are the only ones taking action and we want to call attention to this.” She added: “She [Greta] is really popular and she’s, like, the face of the movement.” On Friday afternoon, Thunberg, Villaseñor and Xiye Bastida Patrick, 17, a Fridays for Future organiser, went inside the UN for an impromptu meeting with general assembly president María Fernanda Espinosa after receiving an invitation during the protest. The trio were given a tour – including a preview of the general assembly podium, at which Thunberg will speak during next month’s climate action summit, and had a meeting with Espinosa, where they spoke about the summit, global heating, forest fires around the world, the Amazon fire and single-use plastics. Villaseñor said the president was “very supportive”. She said: “I said I want to see world leaders take climate action to reduce global greenhouse emissions and stay in line with the Paris agreement and also September 20 we will continue pushing and demanding that they do.” Thunberg told the Guardian in an interview shortly after disembarking from the special “zero emissions” yacht that she wanted “a concrete plan, not just nice words” from leaders about taking urgent and comprehensive action to head off the climate crisis.  Villaseñor, who is thought to be America’s first school striker to join the movement and has been exchanging tips with Thunberg online, had been among the group of American climate activists who welcomed her to the US when her yacht docked at North Cove Marina.  She said: “What’s really important about Greta being here today is it’s the start of something new. Because with the climate summit coming up it’s the way for all the youth to unite here and send a message to world leaders at that climate summit. So even though Greta’s voyage on Malizia ended a couple of days ago, the climate action we will take on this continent has really just begun.” On Wednesday, Thunberg said her generation is having to “clean up” the climate crisis. She also told Donald Trump, who denies there is a climate crisis, to “listen to the science”. On Friday, Almy Batis, 21, a student at Arizona State University, said she saw Friday as a landmark moment for America’s climate movement. “This is a huge moment that Greta is finally here and there are Fridays for Future events scattered across the US. Her movement is going to be amplified in North America … and grow a lot.” Esme Ruiz, eight, from New York, attending with her father, said: “The world is literally melting right in front of our eyes and no-one even realises it. We need to teach them..It’s hard to make changes sometimes, but if you need to save the world, I’d do it rather than die.” Meanwhile, a Brooklyn teacher said she has seen a “Greta effect” in her school. With her coincidental name, but with different spelling, Gretta Reed, 28, said: “In the last two years I’ve seen a big surge in kids really vocalising. Now that they’re organising together, I think it’s really powerful.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterToday I found an interview with an “environmental expert” by the German alarmist site Klimareporter here. It conveys to us the real aims of the radical climate movement. In a nutshell: To change, limit and dominantly control human behavior.
In the Kilmareporter interview, Prof. Rainer Griesshammer says that changing light bulbs, riding your bicycle and eating organic aren’t going to cut it when it comes to rescuing the climate.
In the interview, Klimareporter brings up Mr. Griesshammer’s  recent book in which he calls for “changing politics and life” in order to combat climate change.
Politics, Griesshammer says, will “not be enough on its own” and that “changes in several areas of society – in the value system, consumer behavior, the legal framework and the market, as well as in infrastructure and technology development” are required.
Citizens still in self-deception
In the interview Grießhammer says that citizens are in a state of “self deception” because “most people already think they are environmentalists because they separate the garbage, screw in a few energy-saving lamps or LEDs and occasionally shop at the organic food store”. But this is woefully insufficient. Most people fail when it comes to protecting the climate in terms of “mobility, electricity consumption, nutrition,” says Griesshammer.
Radical behavior change
What is needed, he says, is radical change in “behavior and shopping”. According to Griesshammer: “In the mainstream, there will only be significant changes if laws, CO2 pricing, product development, infrastructures and behavior all move in the same direction.”
According to Griesshammer, offsets are not going to work because people will continue to emit CO2. He says: “CO2 savings can only be achieved through measures in the home country – such as phasing out coal, renovating buildings, speed limits.”

Germany moving far too slowly
Griesshammer thinks the CO2 reduction target set by the federal government is “far too weak” and sees little hope that Germany will come anywhere near the stated targets because the just-decided coal phase-out “is falling further behind” and at the same time, onshore wind energy is being “stifled by the German government.”
Moreover, petrol and diesel becoming around 7.5 cents per litre more expensive next year means “motorists are unlikely to react to this”.
Policymakers must react “much faster”…”much more sharply”
Griesshammer is also in favor of stricter speed limits on the country’s roads and streets, saying the measure would not only save on emissions, but also lives.
When it comes to global warming, Griesshammer says  policymaking has waited far too long: “Now we have to react much faster and much more sharply. There is a threat of incalculable tipping points with irreversible acceleration of the climate catastrophe…”
Bicycle riding, burning wood and deindustrialization
He says that cutting CO2 has been more successful in other countries: “Denmark has less industry and many good wind locations. Finland can use a lot of wood for energy production and continues to rely on nuclear power.”
“In transport,” Griesshammer says, “it makes more sense to adopt something. The bicycle traffic in Copenhagen is a great example.”

Professor of Virology, Henrik Streeck. Institute for HIV Research, Germany,  CC BY 2.5
Investigation dropped
The online German General Anzeiger here reports that the Bonn state prosecutor’s office has decided not to pursue a criminal investigation of renowned researcher Hendrik Streeck, Professor of Virology, after the police had received a 100-page criminal complaint from an unnamed person who claimed to be a scientist.
No criminal science behavior found

“After examining a criminal complaint against the Bonn virologist Hendrik Streeck, the Bonn public prosecutor’s office has refused to start investigations,” reports the General Anzeiger, “No criminal behavior was found to justify investigations, a press spokesman said.”

The unnamed scientist who filed the criminal complaint accused Streeck of “having made up research results and made false statements in connection with the Heinsberg study.”

Also German business magazine “Capital” reported on its online site about alleged “contradictory data on which the ethics committee of the University of Bonn gave the green light for the study to be carried out.”
Streeck was also accused if “making up research results” and refusing “to provide raw data for verification”.
Study: COVID-19 death rate overstated by factor of 10
The distinguished virologist Streeck is the head of the Institute of Virology and HIV Research at the University Hospital of Bonn, and the lead author of the now famous “Heinsberg study” whose results showed that the mortality rate of COVID-19 was in fact significantly lower than that previously claimed by numerous health officials and the media.
According to the University of Bonn: “This number of unreported cases is about 10 times higher than the officially reported cases (162,496 on May 3rd, 2020).”
North Rhine Westphalia’s Minister President used the results of Streeck’s study to defend his decision to relax restrictions.
A number of officials and parties with an interest in spreading panic reacted angrily to the study’s panic-silencing affect. It’s still unknown who was behind the 100-page criminal complaint effort.
Virologists receiving death threats
Wolfgang Holzgreve, Director the University Clinic in Bonn, told the General-Anzeiger he was concerned about “the increasing number of accusations against scientists” and: “It’s amazing what people have to put up with these days. Some virologists have even received death threats. I think we’ll have to live with that.”

"This summer, as rain relentlessly poured down on the Great Lakes region, Detroit declared a rare state of emergency. The swollen Detroit River had spilled into the low-lying Jefferson Chalmers neighborhood – an event not seen near this scale since 1986. Volunteers sandbagged the area as the city’s overwhelmed sewer system spilled raw sewage into the river, which connects Lake Huron and Lake Erie. Across the channel from Jefferson Chalmers, water damaged the historic boathouse on Belle Isle, a 982-acre island park that remains partly shut down because of flooding.  Meanwhile, in Duluth, Minnesota, the city is rebuilding after a powerful storm over Lake Superior damaged a popular pedestrian path, eroded acres of lakefront property and ravaged infrastructure along the shore. About 800 miles to the east, floods hit Buffalo, New York, on Lake Erie in two of the last three years, while Lake Michigan’s historically high waters inundated parts of Chicago throughout the spring and summer months. The havoc wreaked on communities bordering the Great Lakes is a result of their water level steadily rising over the last five years and spiking to record levels this spring and summer. In 2019, the lakes’ depths ranged from 14in to nearly 3ft above long-term averages, according to data from the US army corps of engineers. In June, water in the Lakes St Clair, Ontario, Superior and Erie set records for monthly mean levels, while Lake Michigan-Huron rose to 1in from its recorded peak. That is leading to widespread damage in coastal cities, eroded shorelines and beaches and many other issues. The record levels come just five years after the lakes experienced historically low levels in 2014, and climate scientists say it is clear what’s fueling the drastic swing: the Earth’s rising temperatures. “Bigger picture, it’s climate change,” said Richard B Rood, a professor in the University of Michigan’s department of climate and space sciences and engineering. “There’s no doubt that we are in a region where climate change is having an impact.” Rood said the Great Lakes basin, which holds 90% of the nation’s freshwater, can expect similar shifts in the coming decades as world temperatures increase. Climate scientists say a confluence of climate crisis-related issues resulted in this year’s levels. Warmer air over the Gulf of Mexico caused more evaporation, and that moisture pushed into the region during the spring and summer. Higher temperatures give the atmosphere more capacity to hold evaporated water, Rood said, which is why storms are dumping more rain than 50 years ago. “When you’re in wet periods, you start to get persistent, basin-wide extreme precipitation,” he said. The numbers back that up. By May, Cleveland, Ohio on Lake Erie’s shore saw more rainy days than any year since 1953. Muskegon, on Lake Michigan’s shore, experienced 7.45in more rainfall than average throughout the first eight months, while Sault Ste Marie on Lake Superior tallied about 9in more than average for the same period. Buffalo saw 34% more rain than typical. The moisture rained down on ground and lakes already more saturated than usual because a January polar vortex brought frigid temperatures that prevented wintertime evaporation crucial to keeping water levels in check. Meanwhile, a heavy snow pack melted. pushing up levels even further. “We’re seeing all these things that have an effect on the water cycle converge, which is why we’re having these enormous water volumes,” Rood said. Though the region finally dried out a bit in August and water levels are slightly receding, the Great Lakes’ fall storm season is fast approaching. Fall is a time of high winds and the agency’s six-month forecast predicts levels will remain very high, thus there’s a strong likelihood for even more damage this year. Coastal communities need to give the storms and fluctuating lake levels stronger consideration when building near the shoreline, said Richard Norton, an urban and regional planning professor at the University of Michigan. There’s still an inclination to build as close to the water as possible, which was especially a problem as levels began dropping in the early 2000s. “People want to build in the most beautiful, fragile and dangerous places, and that’s challenging because of the way the lakes go up and down over time in a weird way … and it’s not a good idea,” Norton said. The changes have an impact on the lakes’ ecosystems and natural environment, but it’s a mixed bag. While erosion is an issue, the basin is resilient and has withstood similar variability in the past, said Mark Breederland, an extension director with the environmental agency Michigan Sea Grant. He said extreme fluctuations can benefit the coastal wetlands and some species, while other species, such as the endangered piping plover, face new threats. Meanwhile, the impact of continued climate change on the Great Lakes’ ecosystem is still unknown, Breederland said. However, there is more certainty with water levels. Long-term, as temperature increases continue, the region will see levels “bouncing from low extreme to high extremes”, Rood said, though the lakes will eventually start to disappear if temperatures aren’t brought under control. “If we don’t mitigate our emissions … and the temperature gets to a certain level, then it does become evaporation dominant,” he said. • This article was corrected on 3 September 2019 to situate Buffalo, New York, on Lake Erie rather than Lake Ontario."

Several new temperature reconstructions indicate there were millennial-scale periods with multiple degrees Celsius greater warmth than today (410 ppm CO2) during this glacial period.

Tree remains dated to this period have been discovered 600-1000 meters atop the modern treeline in the Russian Altai mountains.  With lapse rate and tectonic changes considered, this suggests surface air temperatures were between 3°C and possibly up to 5.9°C warmer than today (Ganyushkin et al., 2018) at this time.

Modern sea surface temperatures of 15.5°C and 10°C have been recorded in the subpolar North Atlantic (Tobago Basin and Bonair Basin, respectively). Between and about 10 and 15 thousand years ago, temperatures reached 23°C and 17°C, respectively, which is ~7°C warmer than today). Temperatures were 2-4°C warmer than today between 20 and 30 thousand years ago (Reißig et al., 2019).

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe world was much warmer and greener with meters-higher sea levels just a few thousand years ago.
Between 9000 to 6000 years ago, when global temperatures were 4-6°C warmer than they are today, the Sahara was a tree- and lake-covered haven teeming with megafauna and human civilizations (Manning and Timpson, 2014).

During this same period, the Earth’s sea levels were also multiple meters higher than they are now, as there was much less water locked up on land in the form of ice.
In the Persian Gulf region, for example, the biblically-mentioned city of Ur was once located on the sea coast.
Today, Ur’s ruins are located about 200 kilometers inland.

"The mountain peak known to Swedes as their country’s highest can no longer lay claim to the title due to global heating, scientists have confirmed, as the glacier at its summit shrinks amid soaring Arctic temperatures.  “This is quite a symbol,” said Gunhild Ninis Rosqvist, a Stockholm University geography professor who has been measuring the glacier annually for several years. “A very obvious, very clear signal to everyone in Sweden that things are changing.” In the far north of Sweden, about 95 miles (150km) inside the Arctic circle, Kebnekaise has two peaks: a southern, glacier-covered summit accessible to suitably equipped hikers, and a northern neighbour that is free of ice but reserved for experienced mountaineers. Since they were first measured in 1880, the southern peak has been the higher. But when Ninis Rosqvist and her team took this year’s measurements, at the end of the summer melt on 3 September, the northern peak was 1.2 metres higher at 2,096.8 metres. “We suspected this was probably the case last year,” Ninis Rosqvist told the Guardian from the Tarfala research station at the foot of the massif. “But unfortunately our measurements were not precise enough. Now we can say with certainty: we are accurate to within a couple of centimetres.” The scientist said the height of Kebnekaise’s southern peak was the lowest on record: 24 metres less than in the 1960s. “Almost all the shrinkage has been in past two decades, when the glacier has lost an average of one metre a year,” she said. Since the glacier was likely to expand again with winter snow and ice, the southern peak could briefly recover its ranking, Ninis Rosqvist said. “It will keep changing for a while,” she said. “But the trend is now firmly established, and very clear.” Sweden recorded its hottest ever months of May and July in 2018, with temperatures soaring to more than 10C above normal. With wildfires burning across the Arctic, the Kebnekaise glacier shrank by almost four metres. Although this July was not as hot after an unusually cool start to the month, the village of Markusvinsa in the far north of the country recorded 34.8C on 26 July – the highest temperature ever recorded north of the Arctic circle in Sweden. Ninis Rosqvist said small glaciers such as that on Kebnekaise’s southern peak were particularly badly affected by warm summers. It was mainly cool summers that allowed glaciers to grow, rather than particularly harsh winters, she said. But the past two Scandinavian summers had caused the snow and ice to melt away very fast. “You can see it at the top, where it’s most exposed to the sun. It really looks different. It gets slippery up there; you can see the meltwater running off.” The news may have been expected, but the official downgrading of the southern peak was still “emotionally quite something”, Ninis Rosqvist said. “The mountains are changing so fast – higher temperatures, less snow, winter rain.” The glacier on Kebnekaise’s southern peak was “iconic – a symbol for all the glaciers in Sweden”, she said, adding: “But you know, we don’t need any more symbols. We don’t need to pile up more evidence. We can see the climate changing before our eyes up here, and we need to do something about it.”"

By Die kalte Sonne
(Text translated by P Gosselin)
A documentary from 2015 “Burned“ (free of charge 30 min online version here) goes very well with the often mentioned documentary “Planet Of The Humans“.
Is wood the USA’s new coal?
You can almost get that impression after watching the two films. The United States has decided to consider wood burning  as green energy. You simply assume that trees have converted CO2 into biomass during their growth, so it is a zero-sum game when you burn them later.
This is a very interesting consideration because it ignores the slow growth of the trees. A tree that is burned in a short period of time can only be replaced by a new tree in a much longer period of time. So the calculation is unfortunately very much misleading, and not to mention other positive aspects of trees and forests, which also disappear with deforestation.
Burning wood is pretty much the dirtiest way to generate heat energy. The table below shows the difference compared to other fossil fuels.

Table above shows that wood as a fuel produces far great amounts of pollution.
And it doesn’t matter how big the efforts are to minimize the pollutants when burning wood, even the best values are far away from gas or even oil.
Burned shows in a frightening way how more and more wood chip factories have have set up in the USA. They are all located near coasts, mainly in the east of the country and therefore near ports. These ports are important because there are massive exports to Europe, among others.
After all, the EU has also decided to give the energy blessing to wood-burning. As a result, the forests in the eastern part of the United States have also been massively destroyed since 2000.

At the same time, highly subsidized wood-fired power plants are being built in the USA, where they are operated under the label of “biomass”.
Even former coal-fired power plants can be heated with wood without any problems. Burned shows examples from the UK, where it is done in exactly the same way.
Biomass and car tires

The film also reveals quite different, unpleasant truths. For example, the operators are allowed to burn old car tires or poison-soaked disused railway ties as well. Poisons that have been banned in the USA for some time.
Brazen investors
Looking at houses, cars and plants near such power plants, which are covered with a sticky layer of soot every day, one wonders not only what the environmental standards are like in the USA but also how brazen the investors of such plants are. After all, massive environmental destruction and pollution is being carried out under the label of climate protection.
Takes decades to regenerate a forest
Forests are excellent carbon sinks, but they are much more. In old, mainly natural forests there is a wide diversity of plants and animals. In newly planted plantations, as compensation for the deforested old forests, this diversity is not present. It takes a long time for such systems to form and function. All these thoughts do not seem to be taken into consideration in the USA.
The idea of burning wood instead of coal was also supported for a long time by the US counterpart to Fridays For Future (FFF): 350.org. Its founder and activist Bill McKibben also has his say in the film.
“It seems to me like climate change is a kind of final exam for our species. We’ll find out if the big brain was in fact a good idea or not. Maybe if it’s connected to a big enough heart to make a difference. We’ve been given ample warning by the world’s scientists. Now the question is whether we’ll heed it or not.”

Evolution has given man a large brain for thinking. Using it can never hurt, because then even an activist like McKibben would have to realize what a bad idea the US interpretation of “biomass” is.
Meanwhile, McKibben seems to have come to the realization that it’s not so good to follow the former philosophy “From brown to green” – after being confronted with a first version of “Planet Of The Humans”. But of course, the hundreds of wood power plants built at his behest are still running.
What role does Europe play?
The EU has given the green light to burning wood. It gets even better. Organizations like the German Environmental Aid (DUH) promote pellet stoves as clean heat The table above shows just how clean it really is. Yet, one can also get completely different view if one looks at the development of pollutants in times of corona and strongly decreased traffic.
Does the DUH create its own basis here to get communities in behind it because the values do not decrease even with strongly reduced traffic.
In any case, there seem to be very big differences between environmental activists in the US and those in Europe. While here in Germany, every tree in the Hambach Forest gets defended tooth and nail so that it does not have to give way to coal mining, environmentalists in the USA celebrate the destruction of the environment while the USA gives millions in subsidies for its success.
We’d like to see more of these films so that all facets of the energy revolution are really shown.

Share this...FacebookTwitterPress release by the WERTEUNION IN BAVARIA: “The Sun Drives Climate, Not Co2”.  The Werte Union  (Values Union) in Bavaria decisively rejects “The Green Deal“ and C02-pricing.
Hat-tip: EIKE



Sun drives climate
Munich, December 30, 2019 – The grassroots initiative WerteUnion in Bavaria – Conservative Start – considers it proven that the sun controls the climate, and not carbon dioxide (C02). The new climate laws are therefore insignificant for the climate, yet “threaten the foundations of freedom, prosperity and market economy”, the state level executive said.
In particular, the conservative grassroots movement within the CSU (Christian Socialist Union) criticizes the “Green Deal” presented by EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and the C02 price set by the German government’s climate package, which has now been toughened by raising the C02 price to more than 25 euros per tonne.
Deindustrialization: industries will simply move
The WerteUnion in Bavaria sees this as the first step towards the deindustrialization of Germany. Dr. Thomas Jahn, deputy chairman of the WerteUnion, explained: “The closure of our plants will indeed lead to a reduction in C02 emissions in Germany, but this would not have any positive effect on the environment. The deindustrialization of Germany is rather shifting production to countries with low environmental standards, above all the People’s Republic of China. The WerteUnion in Bavaria sees this as a threat to the fundamental values of the free world, especially the market economy.”

Chemist Dr. Christian Steidl, member of the Federal Executive Board of the WerteUnion e.V. and of the State Executive Board of the WerteUnion in Bavaria, criticized the C02-pricing for the following reasons: “The energy price increase acts as an industrial migration acceleration law. Even if the measure were to result not only in a relocation of industry, but also in C02 savings, this would be insignificant for our climate, because this is controlled by the sun. Over the last 600 million years, C02 has demonstrably not controlled the climate and there is no scientific evidence as to why it should be any different at the moment.”

Education campaign on the topic: “Climate, solar cycles and carbon dioxide”
The Werte Union in Bavaria therefore has announced an educational offensive under the leadership of Bohdan Kalwarowskyj, Dr. Christian Steidl and Dr. Ellen Walther-Klaus about the scientific fundamentals of climate change, as these are neglected especially in schools.
The fact that ice ages were not triggered by a reduction of the C02 content in the atmosphere was already proven in 1913 by the Marburg mineralogy professor Emanuel Kayser (Zentralblatt für Mineralogie etc., 1913, p. 769.). This long disproved CO2- greenhouse gas theory was revived in the 1980s for political reasons and supported by targeted allocation of research funds.
Growing dissent
On the basis of quantum physical, atmospheric and astronomical studies, however, more and more scientists contradict the thesis of a climate change “man-made” by CO2 emissions:

rer.nat. Siegfried Dittrich, one of the most knowledgeable on the effects of C02, has presented this in an article in the scientific journal FUSION Vol. 39. 2018. No. 2 pages 6ff in an easily comprehensible manner.
The refutation by English climate scientists of the C02 theory was discussed by Martin Durkin in 2007 in the film “The Great Global Warming Swindle“ 
The strong correlation of the climate over the last 100 years with the intensity of sunspots is proven in detail. Prof. Dr. Henrik Svensmark studies the influence of solar cycles on climate and cosmic rays on cloud formation. The WELT already reported on this in 2009 under the heading “Ein Physiker erschüttert die Klimatheorie” (A phsicist shakes up the climate theory).
Very informative is also a video of the conversation between Dipl. Ing. Michael Limburg from the EIKE Institute for Climate & Energy with Karl-Herrmann Steinberg. the last Minster for Environment of the GDR.

Climate researcher Rex Fleming recently summarized in his published book: ,,[D]ie vorherrschende Definition des Klimawandels – wie sie von den Vereinten Nationen vertreten und durch einen C02-Ausstoß verursacht verstanden wird – ist ein Mythos“ (T]he prevailing definition of climate change – as advocated by the United Nations and understood to be caused by C02 emissions – is a myth) – Rex J. Fleming: The Rise and Fall of the Carbon Dioxide Theory of Climate Change, Springer Nature Switzerland, Cham (CH), 2019.
Call to reopen the debate
On this scientific basis, the WerteUnion Bayern – Konservativer Aufbruch has adopted a climate manifesto calling for a withdrawal of the C02 pricing plans and an open debate on the real causes of climate fluctuations. The document is available on the website of the WerteUnion in Bayern (https://konservativeraufbruch.de/).

The imagery from 1922 by Odencrants support this likely start of a melting trend, as almost no snow is present on top of Storglaciären, and other glaciers show tendencies of retreat. Between 1920 and 1970, 76% of the mass loss seen from 1910 to 2015 occurred while only constituting 48% of those years. This considerable melt, compared to the subsequent years, is also reflected in the retreat of the terminus, where it retreated approximately 370 m between 1929 and 1959 (Karlén 1973). The mass change of Storglaciären stabilized in the following years, even containing periods of increases in mass, and its mass was almost the same in 2001 as in 1970.”
“Various weather parameters from Tarfala Research Station, a kilometre north east of Storglaciären, exist since 1945, measuring average summer and winter temperatures of +5.5°C and −8.9°C, respectively.  From 1900 to 1920, the mean June–August temperature in Karesuando was 9.88°C, while it rose to 11.63°C for the period 1930–1950.”
“[G]enerally lower ELA between 1880 and the 1930s, with occasional high values, and the ELA reaches comparable lows during the late 1970s and 1990s, corresponding with positive mass balance. The curve thus suggests similar conditions in the late 1800s to, for example, the 1990s.”

A West Greenland glacier that had previously been the “single largest source of mass loss” to sea level rise (a staggering contribution of 9/100ths of a cm during 2000-’10) has recently begun “dramatic thickening” after an abrupt reversal to cooling (-2°C) since 2014.

Image Source: Khazendar et al., 2019
“Jakobshavn Isbrae has been the single largest source of mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet over the last 20 years. During that time, it has been retreating, accelerating and thinning. Here we use airborne altimetry and satellite imagery to show that since 2016 Jakobshavn has been re-advancing, slowing and thickening. We link these changes to concurrent cooling of ocean waters in Disko Bay that spill over into Ilulissat Icefjord. Ocean temperatures in the bay’s upper 250 m have cooled to levels not seen since the mid 1980s. Observations and modelling trace the origins of this cooling to anomalous wintertime heat loss in the boundary current that circulates around the southern half of Greenland.”
“Over the past several years, ocean temperatures have cooled on the continental shelf in the vicinity of Jakobshavn Isbrae . We find that ocean temperatures in Disko Bay below about 150 m cooled by nearly 2 °C between 2014 and 2016.”

Image Source: Khazendar et al., 2019
“The data then show cooling in the first half of 2016 of a normal magnitude (~2 °C) acting on water at already below-average temperatures cooling it to 1 °C, which is ~2–2.5 °C colder than the 2009–2015 values. The mooring data also show that temperatures remain significantly below average through summer 2017.”

Image Source: Khazendar et al., 2019
“Since the late 1990s, Jakobshavn developed Greenland’s largest cumulative ice discharge anomaly, contributing the equivalent of ~0.9mm [9/100ths of a cm] to global mean sea-level rise between 2000 and 2010.”
“To explain the cooling observed in Davis Strait and in Disko Bay in 2015 and 2016, we first note that anomalous wintertime heat loss lowered ocean temperatures across the entire North Atlantic subpolar gyre since 2011 by about 0.6 °C on average in the top 300m of the water column (Supplementary Fig. 13). In the northern Irminger Sea where Atlantic Water first enters the East Greenland Current, ECCO shows that average temperatures have cooled by 0.75 °C over the same time period with the greatest cooling occurring during the winter of 2015. This 0.75 °C cooling of waters far upstream in the Irminger Sea explains part of the 2 °C cooling observed in Davis Strait and in Disko Bay.”

Image Source: Khazendar et al., 2019
“Most prominently, the sharp drop in ocean temperatures in 2016 and 2017 by 2 °C relative to the peak temperature in 2014 corresponds to the slowing and dramatic thickening of the glacier in 2017 and 2018. The higher melting in 2014 simulated in our plume model is not reflected in flow acceleration and thinning, which we cannot explain.”

"‘Tree planting ‘has mind-blowing potential’ to tackle climate crisis.” That’s how the Guardian reported findings from the Crowther Lab in Switzerland two months ago. Billions more trees, scientists claimed, could remove two-thirds of all the carbon dioxide created by human activity. Forest restoration “isn’t just one of our climate change solutions, it is overwhelmingly the top one,” said the lead scientist, climate change ecologist Tom Crowther. Such a programme might take 100 years to be fully effective, but along the way it would reduce the consequences of the climate crisis – protecting soil from erosion, reducing the risk of flooding and providing habitats for a vast range of animals and other plant species.  Some baby steps are already being taken, such as the Bonn Challenge, a global attempt to reforest 350m hectares by 2030. In the UK, tree-planting initiatives include the Northern Forest, which will be made up of 25m trees, spanning the north of England from Liverpool to Hull. But we need to do much, much more. Another study led by Crowther, published in Nature in 2015, estimated that while there are more than 3 trillion trees in the world, that number had fallen by 46% since the dawn of human civilisation. In Brazil, the Amazon rainforest continues to shrink by the equivalent of three football fields every minute as land is turned over to cattle ranching, soya-bean production and mining. In August alone, an area the size of Hong Kong disappeared, not including losses from fires. If you want to do your bit, here are some answers to the big questions. In its recent report Net Zero: the UK’s contribution to stopping global warming, the Committee on Climate Change says the UK needs to increase its woodland from 13% of land area to 17% (the European average is around 35%). We need to be planting 30,000 hectares annually. “In the 2018-19 season, we did just under 13,000 hectares, of which 11,000 were in Scotland,” says John Tucker, director of woodland outreach at the Woodland Trust. “If you looked at England, we probably need six times more tree-planting. We are way off where we should be.” In order to hit the target, says Jon Stokes, director of trees, science and research at the Tree Council, “we need a radically different approach in terms of funding, incentives, land availability, harnessing people power and private-public involvement. Existing woodlands are also valuable habitats and an essential source of carbon capture, however they are not always managed effectively. Improving the management of existing woodlands could maximise their ability to store and capture carbon, and should therefore be a key part of any plan to increase tree numbers or canopy cover.” Can people planting trees in their garden make much of a dent? “One individual tree might not make a difference but if 10m people put one tree in, that would,” says Tucker. “If people feel they want to do something, then planting a tree in the right place is a good thing to do … Get trees that are produced from seed that is sourced from the UK and grown in the UK. We want to avoid encouraging people to buy trees that have been imported because that brings with it a risk of disease.” It isn’t simply a case of filling every available space with trees. Species need to be chosen carefully to ensure they grow well – especially on deforested or degraded land – and fit into the existing ecosystem. “There are other landscapes – such as grasslands and peatlands – which are rich in biodiversity and can also lock up lots of carbon dioxide in their own right. These must be protected and here it might not be appropriate to plant trees,” says Stokes. Isabella Tree, author of Wilding, who, with her husband Charles Burrell, turned a 1,400-hectare farm in West Sussex into one of the country’s biggest “rewilding” projects, is not in favour of plantations. “The advantages of natural regeneration are absolutely huge and haven’t really been taken seriously,” she claims. Creating forest plantations, she says, would require first spraying the area with a weedkiller, such as glyphosate. “Then you’re transporting people in by car, with saplings that have been grown in nurseries in an artificial high-carbon system. They may have been imported, so you’ve got a disease risk there. They also won’t have all the mycorrhizas [beneficial fungi] that they would have had if they were grown in the wild. It’s a human choice what tree is planted where, and we’re not always the best judge of that.” Saplings are usually protected with a plastic tube that doesn’t biodegrade, and also creates “a micro-environment that can encourage a buildup of condensation, so those saplings are often prone to rot and disease buildup. They also encourage the saplings to grow fast and tall, so they are etiolated stems. That may be fine if you’re a forester and you want to grow trees with great tall trunks, but not if you want to get a natural landscape back.” The alternative is to let nature do it. “You allow thorny scrub to grow up, and that happens with birds and wind dispersing seed across your landscape – it’s one of the most biodiverse habitats there is, but in the UK we have zero tolerance for it.” A single jay, for instance, can plant thousands of acorns in a month, she says. “That thorny scrub becomes essentially nature’s barbed wire, to protect that sapling as it grows, so deer and rabbits can’t get at it. The sapling is instantly plugged into all the fungi associates of the scrub and the trees around it, so it’s like getting an intravenous injection of nutrients and minerals from the get-go. That tree will be much healthier and much more resilient than a tree that has been artificially planted. At the end, what you’ll get is an open woodscape, with lateral branches, which is a huge habitat for birds and bats, and a scrubby landscape where you’ve got the next generation of trees coming up. It sequesters carbon in a much more dynamic way than a closed-canopy, single-generational plantation.” One of the obstacles, she says, is funding. It is simple to request funds for, say, 500 oaks in a certain area. It is less easy to say we want to allow trees to regenerate naturally, but can’t say how many that will be. “The funding paradigm doesn’t fit natural regeneration – and that’s one of the big problems.” You don’t need permission, but you do need to think about what species will grow where you live, and also how big it could get. “It’s no use planting an oak tree two feet outside your back door – it will damage your house,” says Tucker. “You need to think about house foundations, underground drains, overhead power lines and make sure the tree is going to be in a place where it can grow and not have any adverse impact.” Think about the effect on your neighbours, too. Smaller species include apple trees or rowan. “The act of planting must not be seen as the end of this process,” Stokes adds. “Aftercare is absolutely vital for young and newly planted trees; without aftercare, we could plant many trees that simply die or don’t grow to a size where they can provide benefits such as capturing carbon.” You can’t plant on waste ground or in your local park without permission from the landowner – that could well be the local council and, says Tucker: “They might be interested in people approaching them and asking them if they can plant trees on their land.” Other good places to try may be school or hospital grounds. If you’re planting more than two hectares of forest (less if it’s a “sensitive area”), you may need to contact your local Forestry Commission office “about whether you need what is, in effect, planning permission to create a new woodland”. There may also be funding available. “We need more trees everywhere, but they perform different functions,” says Tucker. Leaving aside carbon sequestration, “In the rural situation, soil erosion is a real problem and trees in the right place, because their roots help improve water infiltration, can reduce runoff. In our cities, trees can be really good for improving air quality. As the climate warms up, shading in our towns and cities is going to become increasingly important and trees can perform that role. Surface-water flooding is a big problem in cities now and trees can help alleviate some of those flash-flooding episodes.” “Not many of the recent planting grants have been for urban trees, so it’s great to see the Urban Tree Challenge Fund promising to plant 130,000 new urban trees,” adds Stokes. The Tree Council has a national network of volunteers called tree wardens, who help conserve trees in their community. There may also be local tree-planting groups. If there aren’t, you could set up your own (the Woodland Trust offers free planting packs for community groups). Trees for Cities is another organisation that runs tree-planting projects. Donate money or volunteer. There are numerous reforestation charities operating around the world, such as the International Tree Foundation, and TreeSisters, which plants 2.2m trees across the tropics, including in India, Kenya and Brazil, every year. Beyond that, support international organisations that promote the rights of indigenous people, whose land stores nearly a quarter of the carbon stored in tropical forests, and who are best placed to protect forested areas by monitor and report illegal logging. In the UK, lobby the government to take reforestation seriously. “Tree planting rates in the UK in the past probably eight years have been the lowest for a generation, so we are miles off where we should be,” says Tucker. “Stopping deforestation is really important, because about 10% of carbon dioxide emissions come from deforestation,” adds Dominick Spracklen, professor of biosphere-atmosphere interactions at the University of Leeds. Many products we wouldn’t even think of contribute to the problem. “Ask questions,” says Stephen Donofrio, from the organisation Forest Trends. Ask the supermarkets where the palm oil in their products comes from, or the soya feed used to farm their meat. Ask sportswear companies where the leather in their trainers was sourced. Ask the person responsible for your pension fund how much deforestation its investments are causing. “Even if that person doesn’t know the answer, you’ve asked the question and hopefully others will, too, to the point where this comes on to their radar.” Simon Lewis, professor of global change science at University College London, says we should “support the rewilding forest restoration schemes. Lobby companies – and to get legislation – so that the food production chain is deforestation-free. On a personal level, reducing your meat and dairy consumption will take pressure off the land to allow the possibility of having more forest.” Above all, we mustn’t get complacent. “There are people who think we can keep using fossil fuels, and plant a few trees, and it’s all going to be all right,” says Spracklen. “That’s not going to solve climate change on its own.”"

The chart for 2009 shows the 3-day forecast, which according to ARD in fact has not changed.  The 2019 is the forecast chart for the day, and this 1-day chart uses a different color code for temperature. It too has not changed since 2009. The third chart, as already mentioned, is from another source: website: wetter.de. Hat-tip: reader Taylor Martin
=======================================
German public television is splashing red on its weather forecast charts to make people think it’s hot. 
At Facebook, Akinom Dnagiew posted two fascinating side-by-side weather charts used by German ARD public television for weather forecasting:

“Do you feel manipulated.” Image: ARD
Readers will notice how in 2009 a calm, neutral chart was used for showing the day’s high temperatures, in Celsius. But then 10 years later, in 2019, the ARD was using more dramatic and aggressive color scheme to represent temperatures. Now it seems to be hot even when it’s relatively cool!
In 2009, in northeast Germany, 27°C is shown without red hot colors. Then in 2019, even a relatively cool 22°C (72°F) gets shown as red hot.
The German title of the above chart reads: “Fühlen Sie sich manipuliert?” (“Do you feel manipulated?”
Looking at the chart from 2009, one sees the temperatures figures are high, yet we don’t get a hot visual impression. In 2019, on the other hand, a viewer way up in northern Germany might even start sweating a little bit from all the hot looking red, even though the high is expected to be only 20°C (68°F).

Image Source: Rehbein et al., 2020
Even more concerning, the number of active renewable energy facilities inside important conservation areas is poised to increase by ~42% by 2028.
To avert climate climate change, the United Nations demands a 10-fold increase in renewable energy by 2060. This emphasis will especially occur in developing regions like Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, where the most biodiverse regions in the world are the most threatened.
Rehbein et al., 2020
“[R]enewable energy facilities can be landuse intensive and impact conservation areas, and little attention has been given to whether the aggregated effect of energy transitions poses a substantial threat to global biodiversity. Here, we assess the extent of current and likely future renewable energy infrastructure associated with onshore wind, hydropower and solar photovoltaic generation, within three important conservation areas: protected areas (PAs), Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) and Earth’s remaining wilderness. We identified 2,206 fully operational renewable energy facilities within the boundaries of these conservation areas, with another 922 facilities under development. Combined, these facilities span and are degrading 886 PAs, 749 KBAs and 40 distinct wilderness areas.”
“Our results show that renewable energy development has already encroached on many of the world’s most important places for conserving biodiversity, with 2,206 facilities already operational within PAs [protected areas], KBAs [key biodiversity areas] and wilderness areas (Figure S2). Furthermore, the number of active renewable energy facilities inside important conservation areas could increase by ~42% by 2028, suggesting conflicts will likely intensify in the near future.”
“This is especially worrying, when assessments show the growth required to achieve the UN climate targets by 2060 (Bauer et al., 2017; IEA, 2017b) would be an order of magnitude greater than the installed capacity included in our ‘operational’ and ‘under development’ datasets.”
“Our results also show that the spatial distribution of overlaps is moving from developed regions towards more biodiverse developing regions such as Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, where the consequences for global biodiversity conservation will be more intense.”

"The ocean off the western coast of North America is five degrees Fahrenheit hotter than usual after warming at an unusually rapid rate, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa). It has been dubbed the “north-east Pacific marine heatwave of 2019”.  Marine heatwaves are defined as oceanic events in which the surface temperature of the water is warmer than 90% of past measurements for at least five days in a row. The current heatwave is the second-largest since scientists started tracking the phenomenon in 1981, Noaa reported on Friday. If the abnormal patch does not dissipate soon, it could become as destructive as the so-called “blob” of warm water in the same area that, in 2014-2016, created toxic algae blooms, killed sea lions and endangered whales by forcing them to forage closer to shore. Oceanographers started to notice something strange back in June in a triangle-shaped mass of ocean stretching from Alaska to Hawaii to southern California. The direct cause of the heat is weak winds, though these conditions do not usually persist for months at a time as they have done this year. Warm water has also lingered from the previous extreme heat event. “It went from a little bit warmer than average to about as warm as we’ve ever seen it, in just three months,” said Nate Mantua, a research scientist at Noaa’s Southwest Fisheries Science Center in Santa Cruz, California. “It’s not clear to me that there’s a simple link between persistence of this weather pattern and longer-term climate change,” Mantua added. “There might be. It’s still an evolving field and there are a lot of open questions.” The oceans have absorbed about 90% of excess heat linked to the climate crisis. “That’s played out over many decades now, and it’s a slow process compared with this event, which has happened in just three months,” Mantua said. It is also not known if there have been major impacts on marine life, mostly because researchers have relatively little monitoring equipment in the 4m square miles of ocean affected. Oceanographers are starting to see subtle effects in the distribution of some species, Mantua said, such as tuna that are hanging out closer to the coast to avoid the warmer waters. The impact has mostly been limited to the upper 50 meters of the ocean. “If it persists for one to two years, then warming will penetrate to deeper depths,” Mantua said."
"When we’re faced with threats of inundation, our reaction has traditionally been to build walls. Sea-level rises, storms and floods have been held back with solid barriers, seawalls and dykes. We have used walls to keep out people, too: the fact that this has failed throughout the ages has not stopped its recent revival in the United States. The climate crisis threatens global sea-level rises of well over half a metre if we fail to act, while tidal storm surges will reach many times that height. Fiercer and more frequent hurricanes will batter us, and millions of people who live in areas where crops have failed and wells run dry will be forced to flee their homes. But walls will not work with the climate crisis, even if the temptation to try to keep out the consequences, rather than dealing with the causes, is as strong as ever. The prospect of a “climate apartheid”, in which the rich insulate themselves from the impacts of the climate emergency while the poor and vulnerable are abandoned to their fate, is now real. According to the UN, climate-related disasters are already taking place at the rate of one a week, though only a few of them – such as Hurricane Dorian – get reported. Nowhere on Earth will be untouched, with the number of people facing water shortages set to leap from 3.6 billion today to 5 billion by 2050. At least 100 million people will be plunged into poverty in the next decade, and in the decades following that, rising sea levels will swamp coastal cities from Miami to Shanghai, wiping $1tn a year from the global economy. Agriculture will become increasingly difficult, with more people displaced as a result, searching for liveable conditions elsewhere. The Global Commission on Adaptation, headed by Bill Gates and Ban Ki-moon, warned this week that we have failed to plan adequately for a crisis that is now upon us. At a series of high-level meetings beginning in the next few weeks, and continuing into next year, world leaders and representatives of civil society and businesses will try to devise a better response. Among the questions they face will be how to set new targets, secure new funding and take more effective action to help the world not just prevent further warming, but to adapt to the impacts already being felt. Currently, 20 times more is being spent on reducing emissions than building resilience to the effects of rising temperatures and extreme weather, according to the Commission on Adaptation. That seems patently unbalanced, and neglecting adaptation is putting millions of people and their livelihoods in danger now, as well as storing up problems for the future. What’s more, money invested today will pay dividends in the near future. Spending less than $2tn by 2030 would result in more than $7tn saved in damage avoided and better economic growth. These sums sound huge, but are a fraction of the amount the world will spend on infrastructure in the next decade. And modern adaptation means more than building seawalls. Restoring natural features, such as mangrove swamps and wetlands, can do far more to protect coastal regions, as well as nurturing biodiversity and tourism. New technology will play a key role, as early warnings of extreme weather give people time to take shelter or protect their property. Engineering climate-ready infrastructure encompasses everything from porous pavements to urban trees to provide shade. What’s clear is that we need to adapt and build resilience now, because climate change is no longer a comfortably faraway problem. The predicted ravages have come sooner than expected: heatwaves over much of the northern hemisphere last year, floods and extreme weather in south-east Asia, Arctic ice melting at unprecedented levels this summer, and Hurricane Dorian, one of the strongest ever recorded. Worse still, some of these effects are likely themselves to increase temperatures further, in a series of feedback loops. The fires in the Amazon are destroying a vital “carbon sink”. Shrinking ice reveals darker water that absorbs more heat than highly reflective snow. Melting permafrost releases methane, a greenhouse gas many times more powerful than carbon dioxide. It is tempting, in the face of these events, to suggest that the game is up for trying to prevent climate change. The emissions reductions needed to stop it are so vast, and the changes to our way of life so total, that it may seem like all we can do is adapt to the consequences. The hastening prospect of a “climate apartheid” is morally revolting as well as politically alarming, and could lead to a kind of paralysis. The view that adapting to inevitable climate change should be our priority, over futile and ruinously expensive attempts to cut emissions, has been spread by those who want to continue to emit CO2, come what may. Fossil fuel companies saw adaptation, along with the idea that we could geo-engineer our way out of trouble, as a way to keep selling oil while paying lip service to the climate science. Now it is gaining traction among more respectable thinkers. Jonathan Franzen, the American novelist and nature lover, whipped up a storm when he suggested in the New Yorker that: “In the long run, it probably makes no difference how badly we overshoot 2C … Every billion dollars spent on high-speed trains … is a billion not banked for disaster preparedness, reparations to inundated countries, or future humanitarian relief.” It’s true that spending on adaptation is a good deal. It saves lives, and if used wisely could stave off the climate apartheid that experts foresee. But setting up adaptation versus emissions-cutting as an either-or choice is a grave mistake. Trying to adapt to the consequences of climate change while continuing to burn fossil fuels is like trying to mop up an overflowing sink while the taps are still running. As long as we continue to pump CO2 into the air, we are fuelling rises in temperature. We cannot outrun global heating any more than we can hold back the rising sea with dykes. And the fires blazing through the Amazon show that without action, things could easily get much worse. It can seem that in a world of finite resources, we need to make a binary decision about where to put our efforts. That is an illusion. The truth is that dealing with the climate emergency requires an across-the-board approach, for the simple reason that all of our resources – economic, physical, social – are at stake. If we do not throw everything we can at the problem, there won’t be much left anyway. In short, there is no wall high enough to keep out the consequences of inaction on emissions. • Fiona Harvey is an environmental journalist for the Guardian"

The new study states that many published analyses show that lightning activity is responsive to temperature on time scales ranging from the diurnal to the decadal and that the hiatus in global warming earlier this century can be seen in several global datasets.
Scientists found that the statistically flat behavior of the global lightning record from the NASA Lightning Imaging Sensor over the same decadal period is consistent with this hiatus in global warming.
What follows is the paper’s abstract:
Multiple records of global temperature contain periods of decadal length with flat or declining temperature trend, often termed a ‘hiatus’. Towards assessing the physical reality of two such periods (1940–1972 and 1998–2014), lightning data are examined. Lightning activity is of particular interest because on many different time scales it has been shown to be non-linearly dependent on temperature. During the earlier hiatus, declining trends in regional thunder days have been documented. During the more recent hiatus, lightning observations from the Lightning Imaging Sensor in space show no trend in flash rate. Surface-based, radiosonde-based and satellite-based estimates of global temperature have all been examined to support the veracity of the hiatus in global warming over the time interval of the satellite-based lightning record. Future measurements are needed to capture the total global lightning activity on a continuous basis.”
So much for settled science.

"Out in the Macquarie Marshes, about 1ookm north of Warren in the central west of New South Wales, large inland wetlands have become a place for the dead and dying. “We went out last night and there was a little patch of water with dead and dying European carp,” Richard Kingsford, the director of the Centre for Ecosystem Science at the University of NSW, says. “There’s dead and dying things everywhere. Kangaroos dying and even foxes are dying.  “We were trying to trap for turtles but there doesn’t seem to be enough water for turtles. I’m not sure where they’ve gone to.” There are large parts of the Macquarie River that have dried up completely as the state remains in the grip of one of the most severe droughts on record. Valley water storages in the Macquarie are sitting at 11%. In the Namoi, in north-west NSW where water shortages have been acute, they’re at 1.5%. The Border Rivers, in the region between the NSW and Queensland border, are at 6%. In Sydney, dam storages have dropped below 50% for the first time in more than a decade. It’s one part of the climate crisis playing out across much of the country. A different year, similar story. Most places are drier than usual, warmer than usual. The summer of 2018 brought record-breaking heat for Australia. It’s too early to say whether this summer will bring such extremes. But early outlooks for spring and December are again pointing to above average temperatures. And with the exception of parts of Western Australia and the west of Tasmania, the outlook is for below average rainfall. “For most of Australia it’s this consistent dry story for the remainder of the year,” Jonathan Pollock, a climatologist at the Bureau of Meteorology, says. “It’s very likely it’s going to be hotter than usual and it’s very likely it’s going to be drier than usual.” For the first eight months of the year, the country’s mean temperature was the second warmest on record. Mean maximums were the warmest on record over the same period and mean minimums the equal-sixth warmest. Rainfall through winter was below to very much below average for most of the country, including New South Wales, southern and western Queensland, parts of northern and eastern Victoria, the east coast of Tasmania, the majority of South Australia and the Northern Territory, and most of the eastern half of Western Australia, and some coastal areas in the west of that state. In drought-hit parts of eastern and southern Australia, rainfall levels for the season were in the lowest 10% of historical records. Pollock says it would take something like a La Niña, which is associated with heavier rainfall, “to bring the turnaround that we need”. The El Niño-Southern Oscillation is currently neutral and is expected to remain so until the end of 2019 and into early 2020. The prolonged dry and warm conditions have meant authorities have already issued warnings for the spring and into summer. Fire services have told communities to be ready for a challenging bushfire season and to prepare their homes, properties and evacuation plans early. The Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre published its seasonal outlook last week, which warned parts of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, and parts of Western Australia and South Australia, face an above normal potential fire threat. On Friday, just a week into September, authorities issued total fire bans in Queensland and parts of New South Wales, with extreme, and potentially catastrophic, conditions expected in some areas. Richard Thornton, the chief executive of the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre, said winter had brought some significant fires to the north of the country and recent weeks had seen a spate of fires in south-east Queensland and NSW. He said the ongoing drought was driving much of the risk this season and there was concern for forested areas that were already dry heading into the warmer months. Thornton said that included a swathe beginning south of Rockhampton in Queensland and running all the way down the east coast into NSW and east Gippsland in Victoria. “That takes in the major populated areas in south-east Queensland and around Sydney and the ACT – so some pretty significant population centres,” he said. He said the conditions in eastern Tasmania, South Australia’s Eyre Peninsula and Kangaroo Island, south-western WA and parts of the Nullarbor, where rainfall has regenerated grasslands, also looked challenging. In a couple of months, authorities will revisit the outlook to see if anything has changed heading into January and February 2020. Along river systems in New South Wales, the outlook is similarly grim. In the summer of 2018, low river flows caused by a combination of drought and over-extraction of water, coupled with extreme temperatures, caused an environmental catastrophe that killed thousands of fish. Fisheries managers say they anticipate more fish are likely to perish this season if the drought continues. A spokeswoman for the NSW Department of Primary Industries said it was “an evolving situation” and aquatic habitats were being closely monitored. “Significant concerns are held for the Lower Darling, Namoi, Macquarie and Lachlan catchments in the early part of the summer as well as the Barwon-Darling, Border Rivers and Gwydir should current conditions persist,” she said. Up in Queensland, Angus Emmott, an ecologist and farmer, runs a cattle station about 130km south-east of Longreach. The property primarily receives its rain in summer but, until last year, it had what he calls “eight failed summer rains in a row”. That broke last summer, as a result of “two big floods”. “We’re having a really good season unlike much of the country to the east of us,” Emmott says. “Up above us, near Julia Creek, they’ve had so much rain it killed three-quarters of a million head of cattle and washed all the fences and pastures away when Townsville got flooded as well”. Emmott says for his farm it was a case of “luck”. The rains that had helped his property last year had caused catastrophe further north. And outside of the floodplains, places were still in drought. “One thing that’s really affected agriculture in this part of the country is climate change,” he says. “That brings hotter than normal temperatures, drier than usual weather and higher minimums. “Then what is happening is when we get a rainfall event there’s more of a chance of them being massive, like the one at Julia Creek, which created havoc.” Emmott is on the board of the advocacy group Farmers for Climate Action. In a bit more than a week, he says farmers will be travelling to Canberra to call for a national strategy on climate and agriculture. “I think things can change and they actually are but they would change so much quicker if we had a government that took some leadership,” he says. “If we didn’t have to drag them kicking and screaming, we’d get places a lot quicker. This applies to both sides of politics. They talk the talk and then do nothing.”"

"In December the president of the World Medical Association, Dr Leonid Eidelman, said reversing climate change could be the greatest health accomplishment of the 21st century. Eidelman said if doctors want to fully uphold the Declaration of Geneva’s creed that “the health and wellbeing of my patient will be my first consideration”, they needed to take an active role in defending their patients from the adverse effects of climate change.  Doctors around the world take climate change seriously. We are not interested in the politics. We focus on the science. The evidence. The facts. The American Medical Association and the British Medical Association have both declared a climate emergency regarding human health. Other medical associations and groups around the world are also in agreement. Our decision to call climate change a health emergency is informed and considered and is the natural progression of our long-held policy. The AMA has had formal policy on climate change and health since 2004. We update this policy regularly to reflect contemporary science, reports and evidence of the effects on human populations and the environment. The AMA recognises that human health is ultimately dependent on the health of the planet and its ecosystem. Climate change is having significant impacts on human health and health systems, and these impacts will increase in severity as the planet warms. The serious direct and indirect health impacts of climate change include mortality and morbidity resulting from heat stress and extreme weather events; an increase in the transmission of vector-borne diseases; food insecurity; mental ill-health; and negative effects from adverse changes in air pollution. There is inequity in the distribution of these impacts both within and between countries. Although there is an acknowledgement of the environmental harms associated with climate change, the connection between climate change and human health is less understood. National leadership and national coordination are required to draw attention to this issue and to implement interventions to mitigate the health impacts of climate change. The health impacts of climate change will place increasing demand on the health system over time. Australians of all ages need to be confident that they can continue to receive good quality timely access to their family doctor, and other health and medical professionals. This will be especially important in emergency situations, where good communication and organisation in the health sector is paramount. The government must take the lead in developing and coordinating a national strategy for climate change and health so Australia can respond effectively to the health impacts of climate change, extreme events, and to people’s medium- to long-term recovery needs. Not every doctor will agree with our stance on climate change and health but there is a groundswell of support from the future leaders of the medical profession. Doctors in training and medical students rate climate change as one of the greatest challenges facing them as future doctors. Our position on the climate health emergency may divide opinion and create debate – but it is a debate we have to have. • Tony Bartone is president of the Australian Medical Association"

Share this...FacebookTwitterLeading dailies in Germany are reporting today that power companies across the country will be hiking electricity prices once again in the February to April period, affecting millions of households.
This comes at the heels of a January price hike.
“The wave of electricity price increases in Germany is not abating. According to figures from the comparison and brokerage portal Verivox, 86 utilities have announced average price increases of 8.1 percent for the months February to April,” writes Germany’s flagship Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) here. “For a family with an annual consumption of 4000 kilowatt hours, this would mean additional costs of around 100 euros per year.”
Already in January, “543 basic utilities had already increased their electricity prices”, according to the FAZ. “The average increase was 5.4 percent.”
The price hikes come just as Germany’s electricity rates have become among the world’s highest. Annually tens of thousands of German households see their power cut off because they are unable to pay their bills.
A large portion of the rate hike is due to the feed-in tariffs for green energies such as wind and sun.

Canada’s CBC here recently cited “a leaked report” which claimed Canada is “warming at twice the global rate.”
According to the “leaked report”, Canada’s annual average temperature over land has warmed 1.7 C when looking at the data since 1948. But that claim is misleading when recent data is considered.
Over the past 25 years, since scientists began to warn that the planet was warming in earnest, there has not been any warming when one looks at the untampered data provided by the Japan meteorology Agency (JMA) that were measured by 9 different stations across Canada. These 9 stations have the data dating back to around 1983 or 1986, so I used their datasats.
Looking at the JMA database and plotting the stations with longer term recording, we have the following chart:

Data source: JMA.
Though temperatures over Canada no doubt have risen over the past century, there has not been any real warming in over 25 years. Rather, there’s been slight cooling, though not statistically significant. Clearly there hasn’t been any Canadian warming recently.
So it is misleading — to say the least — to give the impression that Canada warming has been accelerating.

"Unprecedented pressure exerted by young activists will push world leaders to address the unfolding climate crisis, even with a recalcitrant US under Donald Trump, Greta Thunberg has told the Guardian.  Thunberg, the teenager whose school climate strikes have ignited a global youth-led movement, said that her journey to New York on a zero-carbon yacht was symbolic of the lengths young people will take to confront the climate crisis. She said: “It’s insane that a 16-year-old has to cross the Atlantic in order to take a stand, but that’s how it is. It feels like we are at a breaking point. Leaders know that more eyes on them, much more pressure is on them, that they have to do something, they have to come up with some sort of solution. I want a concrete plan, not just nice words.” Thunberg’s vessel – fitted with solar panels and underwater turbines to generate its on-board electricity – emerged from the mist of an unseasonably drizzly day to be met by a throng of supporters and media at a marina near the southern tip of Manhattan on Wednesday. Her arrival was heralded by a flotilla of 17 sailboats, charted by the UN, that intercepted her vessel near the Statue of Liberty. Supporters chanted “welcome Greta” as the Swedish teenager stepped off the yacht, shook some outstretched hands and said that it felt like the ground was shaking beneath her feet. Thunberg told the Guardian: “It’s so overwhelming. I’ve gone from nothing but me and the ocean to this.” Despite the adulation from the crowds, Thunberg said she didn’t relish being cast as the global figurehead of the climate movement. She said: “My role is to be one of many, many activists who are pushing for climate action. I don’t see myself as a leader, or icon or the face of a movement.” • This article was amended on 13 September 2019 to clarify a reference to the yacht being solar-powered. The main power source was wind."

The Sun in April 2019

By Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt and Frank Bosse
(German text translated/edited by P. Gosselin)
If we speak of an average of the last 23 cycles in the months of the minimum, our only significant energy source at the center of the solar system was below average active last month as well.
The sunspot number (SSN) was 9.1, which was thus only 42% of the average of the cycles for month no. 125. Some cycles (No. 21, 18, 16, 15, 8 ) were already completed in month no. 125.

Fig. 1: The monthly sunspot activity of the current solar cycle (SC 24) since December 2008 (red) compared to the mean value of all previously systematically observed cycles since the beginning of SC 1 in March 1755 (blue) and the very similar SC 5 (black).
Figure 1 clearly shows that the latest cycle was quite below-normal, especially at the beginning and after the second peak which had an SSN of over 140 towards the end. Since February 2014 (the maximum of the entire cycle 24 with SSN = 146 in cycle month 63), it only reached 2/3 of the average activity.
What are the effects? The total radiation (TSI for total solar irradiance) is only moderately influenced:

Since the maximum, we have seen a decrease of about 1.5 W/m². On the ground this drop decreases to 25% because the earth is not perpendicular to the sun (like the satellite’s sensor) and it rotates. This leaves only a boost of 0.38W/m² in effective radiant power, or 0.1%, which is comparatively little.
Another magnitude may have more influence: During high activity, the sun keeps the galactic cosmic radiation (actually less electromagnetic radiation, but more particles) away from the interior of the solar system. It performs this shielding less effectively with reduced solar activity.

Fig. 3: Galactic radiation since the 1960s. The series has been measured in Moscow. Source. Note: Upper peaks show strong cosmic radiation.
Since the beginning of the 2000s, a decrease of up to 16% compared to the 90s can currently be seen. Also in the maximum of SC24 around 2014 cosmic rays were about 8% stronger than in the maxima since 1980.
We had reported about the connections, which Hendrik Svensmark postulates, in the book and also in the blog (last here) several times.
Next we look at the comparison of the cycles among each other:

Fig. 4: The sunspot activity of the cycles in comparison. The numbers in the diagram are obtained by summing the monthly differences between the observed SSN and the mean (blue in Fig.1) up to the current cycle month 125. 
Also the coming cycle 25 – with a probable start in August 2020 (here we showed how we came to this view) – will again be below average with a high degree of certainty. The peak phase of solar activity from 1935 to about 2005 (SC 17…SC23) is over.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSales of so-called environmentally friendly electric cars have been slumping, despite all the Friday protests and loud cries for cleaner mobility.
Citing a report released by PricewaterhouseCoopers, German news portal t-online.de here reports how “suddenly demand is in the basement: even in China – the world’s largest market for e-cars – sales figures are collapsing”.
It turns out electric cars, with their long charging times, short range and surprisingly high CO2 lifetime budget, are still not attractive enough to consumers in these times of “climate crisis”.
Though sales have picked up in Germany somewhat, but that it’s still “at a very low level,” T-Online reports.
Climate protests, hysteria, fail to sway
Germany is one of the leading Fridays For Future protest countries worldwide, with tens of thousands of protesters turning out weekly. Yet that has not translated into any meaningful change in terms of electric car sales. People have not been swayed by all the climate hysteria and remain uncomfortable with all the technical and environmental drawbacks of plug-in electric cars. Read here.
Big markets dive
T-Online sees the really big trouble for electric cars elsewhere, that is in the markets where they have been traditionally strong: China, Norway and the USA. The German news site reports: “And that’s where the wind has changed, according to a report by management consultants PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC).”

Global: plug in electric fell 23.8%!
“According to the report, 321,573 battery-powered electric cars were sold worldwide in the third quarter of 2019. This is a decline of 2.8 percent compared to the previous year. Sales of plug-in hybrids even fell by a quarter (23.8 percent) to 102,097 units sold. There are various reasons for this,” reports T-Online.
Huge sales drop in China
T-Online reports that the world’s largest market for electric cars, China, “collapsed drastically between July and September 2019.” Adding: ” Sales of electric cars fell by 15.7 percent, of hybrid cars by 20 percent and of plug-in hybrids by as much as 27.3 percent.”
20% Q3 drop in US
Things are not better in the USA. Recently S&P Global reported: “Sales in the US plug-in vehicle market in Q3 2019 were down roughly 20% compared with Q3 2018, but year-to-date sales for 2019 were slightly ahead of sales through the third quarter in 2018.”
Future of electric plug-ins uncertain
Overall there’s growing uncertainty when it comes to the future of mobility and as to which technology will emerge as the most viable, and when.
Countries worldwide are woefully lagging behind in the installation of electric car infrastructure. Policymakers are thus uneasy about investing hundreds of billions into an electric car infrastructure, knowing that it may well be made obsolete by other fuels, such as hydrogen. Investment delays in turn lead to delays in sales.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA number of countries have even made wood-burning a part of their drive to cut down on CO2 emissions. For example cities like Munich, Germany are seeing a rise in wood burning as a source of heat.
Moreover, many German cities are moving to ban diesel engine cars because of the CO2 they produce and, more importantly, all the terrible fine particles they emit.
German cities choking on “green” wood smoke
Yet, ironically, as cities move to “clean” up their act and protect the climate, the opposite is in fact becoming the result. German cities are increasingly choking on fine particles emitted by dirty wood-burning – and activists are turning a blind eye to the growing problem.
In the case of Munich, Swiss meteorologist Jörg Kachelmann recently pointed out that evening time air quality in the Bavarian capital becomes worse than the average air quality of much of New South Wales, Australia even as bush fires rage.
Kachelmann tweeted:
All air measurement stations in the fire-affected New South Wales currently have better air quality than the wood-fired Munich.

"There will always be people who call for additional review or scrutiny of science when the results of a rigorous process don’t yield the outcomes they want. Effectively they want incontrovertible evidence, and anything less is unacceptable to them. Incontrovertible evidence is rare in science, so it is easy to pick some cherry and use it to seed controversy and delay action. History shows how effective the strategy has been. It also shows why the notion of the precautionary principle is so important. The principle requires that precautionary measures should be taken if the risk or threats of harm to (say) the environment are significant. It can mean taking action in the face of uncertainty. But when the available evidence is developed through a rigorous scientific process (and especially when it draws on multiple lines of evidence), suitable precautionary actions can be introduced with confidence.  Take the 2017 scientific consensus statement on “Land use impacts on Great Barrier Reef water quality and ecosystem condition” to illustrate the point. The consensus statement is a comprehensive analysis of the science underpinning the processes and management actions designed to improve water quality and their outcomes. It follows a statement released in 2013 which in turn followed one from 2008. To arrive at the most recent scientific consensus statement, some 1,600 relevant peer-reviewed papers and reports, published over the past few decades, were identified. Each had been circulating and available to the scientific community and other interested readers for more than 30 years. They were produced by some hundreds of authors from diverse institutions in Australia and overseas. They had been published in multiple outlets. They were subject to the usual intense scrutiny that follows publication. The point of the consensus statement was to determine whether there was evidence converging on any particular point. The papers and reports were therefore picked apart and the results analysed by about 50 authors with internationally recognised expertise in Great Barrier Reef and coastal science, particularly water quality science and management. For three of the chapters in particular, the authors drew on additional experts; and all chapters were seen by external reviewers. The whole process was carried out under the watchful scrutiny of the Reef Water Quality Independent Science Panel. The final output is a multidisciplinary analysis and covers the condition of coastal and marine ecosystems, sources of pollutants, risk, catchment scale management priorities, governance, monitoring and modelling aspects, and gaps in knowledge to be addressed. And there was a convergence. There is a consensus: Key Great Barrier Reef ecosystems continue to be in poor condition. This is largely due to the collective impact of land run-off associated with past and ongoing catchment development, coastal development activities, extreme weather events and climate change impacts such as the 2016 and 2017 coral bleaching events. Current initiatives will not meet the water quality targets. To accelerate the change in on-ground management, improvements to governance, program design, delivery and evaluation systems are urgently needed. This will require greater incorporation of social and economic factors, better targeting and prioritisation, exploration of alternative management options and increased support and resources. Two recently published reports add further weight to the evidence: The Reef 2050 Water Quality Improvement Plan Report Card 2017 and 2018 and the Outlook Report produced by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority both point in the same direction – the reef ecosystem overall is deteriorating. There are encouraging patches showing signs of regeneration; and some of the Great Barrier Reef is in excellent condition. The challenge is to use the evidence to develop policy that will sustain the best parts of the Great Barrier Reef while giving any “green shoots” a chance to survive, even in the face of global warming. The balance of evidence is important. The scientific consensus statement (2017) involves the work of some hundreds of independent scientists. There is a small handful of scientists who have argued that the overwhelming majority are wrong, notwithstanding that the most prominent concedes that he is “not the authority on the issue”. If there is evidence that leads to an alternative conclusion, it should be put into the public domain and be subjected to the same scrutiny as the work critiqued in the consensus statement. There has been plenty of time for the work to be done. This is no time for hunches; it is time for evidence. When scientists seek to understand the world they make predictions and then test them. And they publish their results through appropriate channels. Nobody argues that science is perfect. Mistakes can be made and sometimes are. The evidence provided by science at any point in time, however, is the accumulated knowledge that survives after rigorous challenge, scrutiny and testing. We can be confident that decisions made on the basis of evidence derived from the processes of science will continue to provide benefits across society. It has done so for decades notwithstanding well documented diversionary tactics. As a nation, science has been an essential part of making us what we are. There is no reason to stop now. • Ian Chubb is the former Australian chief scientist. He is chair of the Reef Water Quality Independent Science Panel"

Share this...FacebookTwitterA new paper indicates the rise in CO2 concentration occurred well after the Northern Hemisphere’s ocean circulation changes drove the abrupt warming (~11,700 years ago) that ended the last ice age – a lag that effectively leaves no causal role for CO2 during deglaciation.

Ice core evidence from Antarctica also affirms no causal link for CO2 during deglaciation.

The Holocene record itself also contradicts the narrative that says CO2 increases drive climate warming. For the last ~10,000 years, ocean temperatures, surface temperatures, and sea levels fell as CO2 concentrations rose.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI’ve always wondered why alarmists blame storms on climate change, but then go totally silent when storms are absent. Just weather?
Yesterday at WeatherBELL Analytics Saturday Summary video, 40-year veteran meteorologist Joe Bastardi focused on global tropical storm activity.
Western Pacific typhoon activity near record low
On the western Pacific front, Bastardi says: “Normally this time of the year we’ve had 5 typhoons; this year we’ve only had one. And since March first this has been an almost record breaking low activity in the western Pacific.”
Quieter than normal August outlook for hurricanes
Looking at the Atlantic hurricane zones, here we see natural factors at work hampering hurricane development. One of them is dust blowing off the horn of Africa. Here Bastardi believes this area will remain quiet through most of August.

Cropped here.
“Very very bearish” development conditions for hurricanes in the MDR
Another factor hampering hurricane formation in the main development region (MDR), Bastardi says, is the current Atlantic sea surface temperature pattern, which leads to “sinking” over the development region. Sea surface temperatures at the latitudes above the tropics are warm, and this helps to keep the lid down on hurricanes.
Dry conditions
In the tropical main development region (MDR), dry conditions are forecast for the next two weeks, and so hurricanes will have a tougher time developing. Joe Bastardi characterizes the conditions for hurricane development in the MDR as “very very bearish”, i.e. lower than normal development potential.
But the veteran meteorologist does warn that this doesn’t mean hurricanes won’t develop in the MDR. So we need to stay on the look out for “in-close development” where storms form just off the mainland.
All in all, good news so far – especially for the Atlantic – in terms of hurricane season intensity. Let’s hope it remains that way for the rest of the season.

Wind turbines lead to property value loss
RWI – Leibniz-Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung
A study by the Germany-based RWI Leibniz Institute for Economic Research shows that wind turbines can lead to falling prices for single-family homes in the immediate vicinity.
The value of a house one kilometer away from a wind turbine drops by an average of a good 7 percent. For the study, RWI evaluated almost 3 million sales offers on the Immoscout24 online portal.
The most important results:
– The effect decreases with increasing distance from the wind turbine. At a distance of eight to nine kilometres, wind turbines no longer have any effect on property prices.

– The researchers attribute the loss in value of the properties to the negative effects of wind turbines on their immediate surroundings – such as noise and disturbance of the landscape.
– As the RWI study shows, not all properties suffer the same loss in value: old houses in rural areas are hardest hit. Here, the loss in value within the one-kilometer radius can even amount to 23 percent. In contrast, houses on the outskirts of cities hardly lose any value at the same distance from a wind turbine. This could be due to the fact that in urban areas disturbances of the landscape or noise are less noticeable than in rural areas.
“Even if wind power plays an important role in the success of the energy system transformation, the effects for property owners can be serious in individual cases,” says Manuel Frondel, head of the “Environment and Resources” competence area at RWI. “Installing a wind turbine can cost homeowners tens of thousands of euros.“
For the study, RWI evaluated almost 3 million sales offers that appeared on the Immoscout24 online portal between 2007 and 2015. The effects on real estate prices were estimated using a hedonic price model that takes into account the exact distance between the wind turbines and the single-family houses in question, as well as the many properties of the houses and the socio-economic environment.

Share this...FacebookTwitterExtensive hake (fish) skeletal remains in ocean waters too cold for this species to occupy today suggest past ocean temperatures were several degrees warmer.
Fish habitats are limited by specific temperature boundaries. In a new study, for example,  Wheeland  and Morgan (2020) found there was a pronounced ocean warming from the 1980s to late 1990s off the coasts of Greenland. This temperature shift changed the distribution of halibut habitat. Since then, however, there has been no net warming in the study region (through 2016).

Image Source: Wheeland  and Morgan, 2020
In a new study, Bas et al. ( 2020)  document a large presence of a temperature-sensitive fish species (hake) at 53°S (southernmost South America) when current hake venture no further south than 47°S. This latitude differential for hake habitat suggests the ocean was 4-5°C warmer than today about 5000 years ago (Mid-Holocene).

Image Source: Bas et al., 2020
Evidence for anomalously cold present-day sea surface temperatures in southern South America relative to past millennia has also been documented by Caniupán et al., 2014. This region’s temperatures may actually be nearly the coldest of the last 10,000 years – cooler than the temperature depths reached during the “global Little Ice Age”.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt the end of the last glacial, when CO2 concentrations hovered around 250 ppm, there were abrupt warming and cooling events in the Spanish mountains (Béjar range) with magnitudes of 3°C within decades. Peak temperatures were at times warmer than today.
It has often been claimed that abrupt warming and cooling events with amplitudes reaching multiple degrees within 20 to 50 years were confined to records obtained from polar climates.
Greenland
Greenland, for example, warmed by 8 to 16°C “within decades or less” 20 or more times during the last 80,000 years (Li et al., 2019). The warming and cooling events may have occurred in the absence of an external an forcing mechanism; instead, they were an “unforced oscillation”. The abrupt climate changes extended throughout the Northern Hemisphere and even into the Southern Hemisphere.

New England (US)
In the northeastern United States, temperatures plummeted by 5.6°C within 200 years about 13,000 years ago (Hou et al., 2007). Then, around 11,600 years ago, temperatures abruptly rose ~5.4°C “in less than 200 years”. One proxy location (Blood Pond) even suggests there was an 8°C warming event in the US about 11,500 years ago.

Western Spain (Béjar)
A new study (Lopez-Saez et al., 2020) of the Late-Glacial-Early-Holocene period (about 15,000 to 11,500 years ago) analyzes evidence of tree cover transitions in the western Iberian region (Spain).
Deciduous oak forests were assessed to have abruptly expanded and declined during this period. The established temperature tolerances for this tree species suggest the warming-cooling transitions occurred within decades to centuries, and the climate change amplitudes could reach 2-4°C.
Despite the low and modestly fluctuating CO2 concentrations during this Late-Glacial period (~250 ppm), the evidence suggests regional temperatures were warmer than today 13.9, 12.3, 11.5-11.3, and 10.9 ka cal BP (thousand calibrated years before present).
These pronounced natural climate change events in the paleoclimate record do not support the contention that modern temperture changes are unusual or unprecedented.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAnother new paper, which of course will be ignored by the government-funded IPCC because it contradicts claims CO2 drives climate, shows that natural factors dominated the earth’s climate variability.
A team of scientists led by Jerome Goslin have published a paper titled Decadal variability of north-eastern Atlantic storminess at the mid-Holocene: New inferences from a record of wind-blown sand, western Denmark in the journal Global and Planetary Change, suggesting climate variability is driven naturally.

Climate change driven by solar and oceanic cycles
Not surprisingly, as evidenced by hundreds of other publications (which are entirely ignored by the IPCC), climate variability is indeed tied to solar activity and “internal atmospheric and oceanic modes”.
The authors report they found “periods of high storminess activity to be significantly correlated with solar minima and relative pluri-decadal lows in the NAO.”

In layman terms: solar and oceanic cycles play the major roles in climate variability.
Co2 as sole driver is pathetic unscientific nonsense
Taking it a step further: suggesting that these powerful natural cycles stopped driving climate some 100 years ago and claiming a few extra molecules of CO2 have since taken over the climate driver’s seat is pathetic nonsense, one that could only be sustained by a government-funded mega-billion-dollar disinformation/scare campaign.
The paper’s abstract:




Disentangling the external and internal forcing responsible for the variability of the Earth’s climate and associated extreme events over the Holocene is crucial for producing reliable scenarios of adaptation to the effects of ongoing climate change. At mid-latitudes, significant relationships between westerly storminess, solar activity and internal atmospheric and oceanic modes of variability have been repeatedly evidenced to exist over millennial and centennial time scales. However, at shorter (decadal) scale, it is still challenging to establish clear control links between the forcing mechanisms and the spatio-temporal variability of past extra-tropical storms. This probably owes to the existence of complex multi-scale relationships and feedback loops, as well as to the difficulty of producing proxy-records of sufficiently high-resolution and wide spatial significance.
Here we present a reconstruction of westerly storminess in western Denmark between 4840 and 2300 yrs. cal. B·P. Past-storminess is retrieved from an organic-rich sedimentary succession by combining markers of aeolian sand influx, μ-XRF geochemistry and plant macrofossils. Particular focus is paid to the c. 4840–4350 yrs. cal. B·P. period for which our record is characterized by a pluri-annual resolution. We evidence concurrent pluri-decadal shifts in storminess and humidity regime at our site that we interpret as relocations of the mean westerly storm-track over the North-Atlantic. The signal is dominated by ≈ 90, ≈ 50–80 and ≈ 35-yr periods, evoking possible links with solar activity, the North-Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the Atlantic Multidecadal oscillation (AMO) and the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) modes of variability, respectively. The ≈ 35-yr periodicity found in our record is especially strong and stationary, suggesting that storminess could have been closely linked with the AMOC over the study period. Our records of storminess indeed show some great similarities with a record of deep overflow of a branch of the AMOC. Opposite to some model outputs, the strength of the AMOC seems to have often co-varied with storminess at pluri-decadal scales over the study period. We also find periods of high storminess activity to be significantly correlated with solar minima and relative pluri-decadal lows in the NAO. We suggest that small lowering in the strength of the NAO in an otherwise positive NAO context may have caused southward relocations of the mean westerly storm-track from subpolar latitudes to northern Europe. This invites to reconsider the importance given to using the NAO as a binary index.
Finally, an attempt is made to explore the temporal lead-lag relationships between storminess and different potential forcing agents such as the Total Solar Irradiance, the NAO and the AMOC. Unfortunately, the insufficient chronological precision of the proxy-records available for the TSI, the NAO and the AMOC over the study period prevents us from deriving any robust interpretations regarding potential teleconnections at a decadal-scale between past north-Atlantic westerly storminess activity, solar forcing, the NAO and north-Atlantic surface and deep oceanic circulation.”

"Kudos to Stephen Buranyi for drawing attention to the growth of air conditioning worldwide and the accompanying taste for cold in a time of global warming (Blowing cold and hot, The long read, 29 August). Having lived and worked in the American south, I can attest there are even more pernicious dimensions to this addiction to cold. Restaurants and bars are kept uncomfortably chilly, thus encouraging higher levels of consumption (heat dampens the desire to eat), fuelling not only profits but the obesity crisis. Cold has become a mark of prestige: the fancier the establishment, be it office block or shopping mall, the colder it is likely to be. Anecdotally, moving between these absurd temperature extremes several times a day seems to increase the incidence of colds. When I requested that the AC in my workplace (a public university) be set to a warmer level, the response of the facilities staff was to provide a heater for my office. Here in New York, a hotel on my street keeps a roaring fire in the lobby – in August – while the ambient indoor temperature is freezing. All this amounts to what Richard Seymour has recently called “climate sadism” – a form of masochism outwardly and ostentatiously directed, consumptive and destructive madness. May we find ways not to get caught up in its drive.Emanuela BianchiNew York  • When I was a legal adviser to the Export Credits Guarantee Department back in the 1970s I was told by an architect that he had been retained by the ruler of one of the Gulf states to build a tower office block along the lines of those now disfiguring the City of London. He asked his client where he would like the power station as the block would consume inordinate amounts of electricity for air conditioning. The architect pointed out to his client that it would be more sensible to keep to traditional styles of building, like the medieval souks, which are kept relatively cool by judicious circulation of air. It seems that the architect’s advice was not heeded. We now have extraordinary developments such as Dubai, which must be consuming energy at a prodigious rate.Dr Anthony J CooperGreat Shelford, Cambridgeshire • Stephen Buranyi says “the warmer it gets, the more we use air conditioning”. He is right for the richest of us. Others have to cope with such temperatures, or die. The 1995 Chicago heatwave led to 739 heat-related deaths over five days, of the mainly elderly poor who could not afford air conditioning and did not open windows for fear of crime. Comfort really is a social construct. People adapt to those conditions they normally occupy, and if they become uncomfortable, they change themselves, or their environment, to return to comfort.  In a world of rising energy prices, tanking economies, grid failures and more extreme weather events we have to think differently. Imagine a future where buildings are run for as much of the day and year as possible, on local natural energy, from sun and wind, and only when absolutely necessary are they heated and cooled. This is a revolutionary idea in societies where people fear crime and modern buildings are designed with too much glazing, and no natural ventilation and consequently overheat. For you, in your own home, my advice is to insulate your roof, shade and open your windows, and get security grilles for them. Only when this strategy fails, move rooms, locations or, in extremis, use mechanical cooling. Simples.Susan Roaf(Emeritus professor of architectural engineering, Heriot Watt University), Oxford • Your article does not mention the decades of scientific experiments proving we do not need AC, if we design or add the right construction. The Building Research Station in Watford has an experimental, comfortable, office block with no AC. It works by having a construction of exposed “high thermal mass”, solid plaster on concrete ceilings, floors, walls. At night cool air flows through to build up a store of “coolth”, so no noise, or bad air problem in daytime with windows closed. Usual office and modern home construction has the opposite of high thermal mass. The sun’s heat comes in and has nowhere to go but to raise the air to stifling temperatures. In the experimental building the windows are shaded to reduce over-heating, and the lesser heat soaks away into the heavy construction, leaving air at moderate temperature. The same effect is felt in solid brick or concrete homes. My own 1900 flat has been very cool all night and day with heavy construction, sucking away the heat. My son’s modern flat has been far too hot, with very high winter insulation, covered with only 1cm of plasterboard, nowhere for heat to soak away. Regulations are going to be changed to make low winter energy buildings cooler in summer.Anthony EdwardsRetired architect, London • Stephen Buranyi’s article did not cover modern developments. In summer air conditioning can easily be powered directly by the sun via solar panels. In winter solar power stored in an electric car’s batteries can extract two and a half times more heat from the outside as used to power the air conditioner, thus reducing carbon dioxide emissions from gas central heating units.Donald HawthornRuddington, Nottinghamshire  • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

Share this...FacebookTwitterReforestation removes CO2 from the atmosphere. Reforestation substantially cools the Earth’s land surfaces. Therefore, reforestation offers a “meaningful opportunity for local climate mitigation and adaptation”. So why are we focused on CO2 mitigation via reduction in fossil fuel use?
Cooling the surface via reforestation
A few months ago NoTricksZone featured a new study that determined global warming can be reversed via land cover changes. Forest losses can warm local temperatures by as much as 1°C within 10 years (Alkama and Cescatti, 2016).
Huang et al., 2020 found the opposite can occur too. When a region returns to forest and tree cover, cooling ensues.
And with a growing percentage of European forested areas returning, a “predominant regional biophysical cooling” with “an average temperature change of −0.12 ± 0.20 °C, with widespread cooling (up to −1.0 °C) in western and central Europe in summer and spring” has swept across Europe due to land cover changes in recent decades.

Image Source: Huang et al., 2020
Another new study finds reforestation may cool the local surface climate by up to 6°C
Now, results from another new study (Novick et al., 2020) suggest reforestation can mitigate “deleterious effects of climate warming” as it dramatically cools surface temperatures. Cooling from reforestation can reach magnitudes of 2-3°C for the air above the surface and 4-6°C for surface climate.
Further, as has been reported here recently, forest expansion substantially expands the Earth carbon sink and removes CO2 from the atmosphere such that future forest expansion, or greening, could offset 17 years of equivalent human CO2 emissions by 2100.
This easily supersedes the effect of Paris Agreement CO2 mitigation policies and suggests that global warming and CO2 emissions mitigation could far more easily and inexpensively be achieved by focusing on reforestation rather than fossil fuel reduction policies.

"A craft distillery in Scotland could become the greenest gin and whisky producer in the world as part of the government’s plans to cut industrial climate emissions. The Orkney Distillery has secured a slice of the government’s £390m fund to help develop low-carbon technologies that could reduce carbon emissions from industry. It hopes to use the funds to become the first gin distillery in the world to run on hydrogen made from renewable energy rather than liquid petroleum gas.  The Orkney gin project will use renewable electricity to run an electrolyser that splits water into hydrogen and oxygen. A spokesman for the distillery, which plans to make whisky in the future too, said it does not believe there is another distillery in the world capable of producing spirits with a smaller carbon footprint. The project could reduce emissions from the plant by about 86 tonnes of carbon every year, equivalent to the emissions from 10 homes or 18 cars. The same technology, at a much larger scale, could create “green” hydrogen to replace traditional high-carbon gases used in industry, or for transport fuels and heating. Lord Duncan, the climate change minister, said developing hydrogen technology means the UK will be able to reduce climate emissions from industry as it shifts to a cleaner economy. “It’s great to know we can all enjoy an environmentally friendly tipple while helping our planet as we press towards a net zero emissions economy by 2050,” Duncan said. The government expects hydrogen to play a major role in meeting the 2050 target because it can take the place of more polluting fuels. It plans to spend almost £400m on reducing industrial emissions, including plans to develop hydrogen technologies, most of which will be channelled into the steel and iron sector. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy laid out plans for a £250m Clean Steel Fund to help cut emissions from the iron and steel industry, which make up a sixth of the UK’s total greenhouse gas emissions. It is seeking views on the design of the fund through an industry consultation that runs until late November. The department will also spend £100m to support a competition to find new ways for businesses to use low-carbon hydrogen, and £40m on a nationwide green technology fund."

Like the corona crisis, in the face of the climate crisis it’s time to seriously encroach on fundamental rights, says a German public law professor. Image: Leuphana University of Lüneburg. 
Germany, true to its DNA, is once again gravitating towards dictatorial rule. A number of leading figures are praising the corona restrictions as an example of what needs to be done to fight the climate crisis.
One example figure is German public law professor Thomas Schomerus, who writes at his blog that “lessons for the climate crisis can be drawn from the corona crisis.”
Make people fear for their lives, the German federal judge and law professor implies.
“Make public accept “even the most serious encroachments”
The only thing that is needed for the public acceptance of “stringent measures”, says Schomerus is communication made “in a transparent, comprehensible, science-based and multimedia-based manner”.

If this is done, he writes, “the population will be prepared to accept even the most serious encroachments on fundamental rights.”
Just as convincing as the fear of death
He writes that the concern about the future of children and grandchildren “can be just as convincing” as the fear of death by the Corona virus.
Schmoerus at his blog expresses that the current collapse of global air travel and massive economic slowdown – which involves millions of unemployed – as a positive thing for the environment and thus similar restrictions should be kept in place even after the corona crisis subsides.
“The fight against the virus can set an example in the fight against global warming,” he claims.
Climate crisis requires “freedom-limiting measures”
Schomerus, a specialist for public law for energy and environmental law, asks at his blog why the government doesn’t take the same strict action against climate that it is now taking against the Corona virus. He adds:
Both the corona crisis and the climate crisis require freedom-limiting measures. The earlier and more vigorously these are defined and implemented, the sooner the success that is vital for survival can be expected. In this respect, corona and climate protection measures do not differ in principle, but only on the time axis. The following also applies to climate protection: the earlier and the more far-reaching they are taken, the lower the ecological, economic and social follow-up costs.”
According to his blog, Thomas Schomerus is Professor of Public Law for Energy and Environmental Law at the Faculty of Sustainability, Leuphana University Lueneburg and Judge at the Higher Public Administration Court for Lower Saxony.

"The European Union will push Australia to clean up its petrol standards – which currently allow for dirtier fuel than India and China – as part of negotiations on a new free trade agreement. As the EU and Australia prepare for the next round of FTA negotiations in October, Guardian Australia understands the issue of Australia’s poor fuel quality, which prevents the sale of a range of European vehicles with higher standard engines, has already been raised at a bureaucratic level as a “technical barrier to trade”. Europe will also be using the EU-Australia free trade agreement to cement Australia’s support for emissions reduction targets agreed to under the Paris accord, with Europe flagging it wants the “respect and full implementation of the Paris agreement” underscored in the text of the agreement. The issue of fuel quality is one of a raft of industrial barriers that Europe is pushing Australia to consider as part of a wide-ranging new free trade agreement, along with the removal of a 5% industrial tariff and changes to Australia’s luxury car tax, which overwhelmingly hits European vehicles. Australia ranks 66th in the world for its fuel quality, the lowest of all developed countries, with an allowable sulphur content up to 15 times higher than countries like China. Australia’s most popular unleaded petrol – 91 unleaded – allows sulphur levels of up to 150 parts per million compared to the 10ppm allowed by the European Union, and the government has indicated this will not change until 2027. This means some of the best and cleanest European cars cannot be exported to Australia, leaving some manufacturers to either export older generation engines on certain models, or to not export them at all. The federal chamber of automotive industries has said that without Australia’s fuel quality being brought into line with other developed countries, the “latest-technology, low-emission engines cannot be supported in the domestic market”. The Fcai has also told a parliamentary hearing into electric vehicles that improving Australia’s fuel quality would offer a “3% to 5%” improvement on CO2 performance “overnight”. In 2015, the Coalition set up a ministerial forum on vehicle emissions aimed at addressing three proposals for improving fuel standards that were outlined in a 2018 discussion paper. But the forum has been criticised over its inaction, and before the May election the government quietly postponed fuel standard improvements for Australian refiners until 1 July 2027, in line with the petroleum industry’s demand. The trade minister, Simon Birmingham, said the issue of Australia’s fuel standards would be considered as part of the bilateral negotiations. “As part of the free trade negotiations we will consider everything that is put on the table. Whether we agree to it is a different matter,” Birmingham told Guardian Australia. “It is not Australian practice to simply adopt European standards – we urge and encourage common adoption of international standards where possible. “But we will work through in a practical way any of these issues and see what may be possible in the Australian context, but ultimately we will only be doing any agreement if it is in the overall benefit of Australia.” Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning On the likelihood that Australia’s commitment to the Paris climate agreement will need to be enshrined in the new FTA, Birmingham said Australia would be happy to comply. “Our commitment to Paris is firm and resolute and we are happy to reinforce that commitment in any forum.” Along with industrial and environmental concerns, Australia and the EU are attempting to negotiate through a host of agricultural barriers, with Australian farmers hoping to gain further access to Europe’s highly protected market. Tariffs on imported lamb and beef to the EU are as high as 50%, but Europe is considering a boost to the low tariff quota allowed to Australian exporters for high-quality produce. Europe is pushing for Australian action on so-called “geographic indicators”, which would prevent Australian producers using a suite of brand names it deems to be its intellectual property, such as feta, gruyere and gorgonzola. Australian cheesemakers have expressed concern that the proposed ban on product names could require expensive rebranding and cost jobs. Asked about the progress being made on the FTA, negotiations for which began in June 2018, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said it was “complex”. “It is just step by step by step by step,” he said. “But there is a real keenness to engage with Australia.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterAccording to a new paper, the Earth’s ocean heat content time derivative (OHCTD) has been decreasing (-0.26 W/m²/decade) since 2000, coinciding with a similar deficit in the Earth’s energy imbalance (EEI). The authors acknowledge such trends are “surprising” considering greenhouse gas emissions have risen.

Image Source: Dewitte et al., 2019
Earth’s energy budget imbalanced?
Global warming occurs when there is more energy coming in to the climate system than leaving. This results in a positive imbalance in the Earth’s energy budget.
Most studies claim the imbalance has been about +0.6 W/m² since the 2000s (Stephens et al., 2012, Llovel et al., 2013), although the uncertainty in the surface energy imbalance estimate reaches ±17 W/m² (Stephens et al., 2012). Uncertainty in the Earth’s energy imbalance is therefore more than 100 times larger than the total accumulated forcing for CO2 over a 10-year period (+0.2 W/m², Feldman et al., 2015).

Image Source: Stephens et al., 2012
A cooling global ocean?
Per the IPCC, 93% of “global warming” is manifested by rising trends in 0-2000 m ocean heat content (OHC) (IPCC AR5, Chapter 3).
In 2006 scientists published a paper in Geophysical Research Letters asserting global OHC had rapidly declined from 2003 to 2005.

Image Source: Lyman et al., 2006
Cooling must be corrected to show warming
Of course, a cooling ocean does not conform with climate models predicating ocean heat content should rise in tandem with CO2 emissions.
So the overseers of ocean heat content datasets set out to find a way to “correct” the data.
Sure enough, by 2007, NASA’s Josh Willis had discovered two biases that could explain the cooling. The OHC data could now be changed to show warming.
Josh Willis’s correcting-the-cooling feat was even featured in a NASA article blithely titled “Correcting Ocean Cooling” that same year.

Then a few years later, Loehle (2009) also found the global oceans had been cooling at a rate of -0.35 (±0.2) x 10²² Joules per year, but this time the cooling had extended from 2003 to 2008.

Image Source: Loehle, 2009
With “uncorrected” ocean data assessing a cooling trend from 2003 to 2008, it wasn’t long before the data overseers decided they must remove all the cooling from the record.
So they did.
Today, the period between 2003 and 2008 has been “corrected” to show a stint of rapid warming.

New paper: Earth’s energy imbalance in deficit since 2000
A new data analysis authored by three Belgian scientists (Dewitte et al., 2019) finds not only has there been more heat energy leaving than accumulating in the Earth’s climate system this century, but ocean heat content time derivative (OHCTD) has likewise been declining since the early 2000s.

Image Source: Dewitte et al., 2019
The authors assessed the trends in OHCTD during 1960-2015. They found that although there was a rising trend from 1982 to 2000, since 2000 the OHCTD trend has been decreasing at a rate of -0.26 W/m² per decade.
Compatibly, Dewitte and co-authors also determined there has been a declining trend (-0.16 ±0.11 W/m² per decade) in the Earth’s energy imbalance (EEI) from 2000-2018.
The scientists acknowledge that these trends may seem “surprising” at first given the sharp rise in greenhouse gas emissions in recent decades. But they find the agreement between the recent OHCTD and EEI trends “adds extra confidence” to their results.
Expect these results to be “corrected” by the data overseers in due time.

"Climate change is not only having a devastating impact on the environments we live in, but also on respect for human rights globally, the UN has warned.  The UN rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, cited the civil wars sparked by a warming planet and the plight of indigenous people in an Amazon ravaged by wildfires and rampant deforestation. She also denounced attacks on environmental activists, particularly in Latin America, and the abuse aimed at high-profile figures such as the teenage campaigner Greta Thunberg. “The world has never seen a threat to human rights of this scope,” she told the UN human rights council in Geneva. “The economies of all nations, the institutional, political, social and cultural fabric of every state, and the rights of all your people, and future generations, will be impacted” by climate change, she warned. The 42nd session of the council opened with a minute of silence for the victims of Hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas, where at least 44 have been killed and thousands of homes reduced to rubble. “The storm accelerated with unprecedented speed over an ocean warmed by climate shifts, becoming one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes ever to hit land,” Bachelet said. Low-lying small island states like the Bahamas, which are heavily affected by climate change, are quickly seeing rights to water, sanitation, health, food, work and adequate housing, she warned. She called for international action to mitigate the impact there. The UN high commissioner for human rights also denounced the “drastic acceleration of deforestation of the Amazon. “The fires currently raging across the rainforest may have catastrophic impact on humanity as a whole, but their worst effects are suffered by the women, men and children who live in these areas,” she said. She urged authorities in Bolivia, Paraguay and Brazil to “ensure the implementation of longstanding environmental policies … thus preventing future tragedies”. Bachelet’s comments risk further angering the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, who last week accused her of meddling in his country’s affairs after she criticised the deteriorating rights situation there. The UN rights chief also highlighted the impact climate change is having on insecurity around the world. She cited a UN estimate that 40% of civil wars over the past six decades have been linked to environmental degradation. In the Sahel region of Africa for instance, degradation of arable land “is intensifying competition for already scarce resources”, she said. This in turn exacerbates ethnic tensions, and fuels violence and political instability, she added. Bachelet lamented that those sounding the alarm over the devastating impacts of climate change are often attacked. UN experts, she said, had “noted attacks on environmental human rights defenders in virtually every region, particularly in Latin America”. “I am disheartened by this violence, and also by the verbal attacks on young activists such as Greta Thunberg and others, who galvanise support for prevention of the harm their generation may bear,” Bachelet said. “The demands made by environmental defenders and activists are compelling, and we should respect, protect and fulfil their rights.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn the last few years, hundreds of peer-reviewed scientific papers have been published linking changes in solar activity to Earth’s climate (2016, 2017, 2018). The evidence for a robust Sun-Climate connection continues to accumulate in 2019.
When it comes to the Sun’s influence on climate, one conclusion is certain: there is no widespread scientific agreement as to how and to what extent solar activity and its related parameters (i.e., galactic cosmic rays, geomagnetic activity, solar wind flux) impact changes in the Earth’s temperature and precipitation.
The disagreement is so chasmic and the mechanisms are so poorly understood that scientists’ estimates of the influence of direct solar irradiance forcing between the 17th century and today can range between a negligible +0.1 W m-2 to a very robust +6 W m-2 (Egorova et al., 2018; Mazzarella and Scafetta, 2018).
“There is no consensus on the amplitude of the historical solar forcing. The estimated magnitude of the total solar irradiance difference between Maunder minimum and present time ranges from 0.1 to 6 W/m2 making uncertain the simulation of the past and future climate.”  (Egorova et al., 2018)
“According to the IPCC (2013), solar forcing is extremely small and cannot induce the estimated 1.0–1.5 °C since the LIA. However, thesolar radiative forcing is quite uncertain because from 1700 to 2000 the proposed historical total solar irradiance reconstructions vary greatly from a minimum of 0.5 W/m2 to a maximum of about 6 W/m2 (cf..: Hoyt and Schatten 1993; Wang et al. 2005; Shapiro et al. 2011). Moreover, it is believed that the sun can influence the climate also via a magnetically induced cosmic ray flux modulation (e.g.: Kirkby 2007) or via heliospheric oscillation related to planetary resonances (e.g.: Scafetta 2013, 2014b; Scafetta et al. 2016, and others). Since solar and climate records correlate quite significantly throughout the Holocene (cf: Kerr 2001; Steinhilber et al. 2012; Scafetta 2012, 20104b), the results shown herein may be quite realistic, although the exact physical mechanisms linking astronomical forcings to climate change are still poorly understood.”  (Mazzarella and Scafetta, 2018)
Thus far in 2019, 55 scientific papers have been located that link solar forcing to climate changes.  This is an incomplete compilation and it is likely to swell to about ~100 papers by year’s end or upon further review.
Such a large volume of research devoted to finding connections between the Sun’s variability and its effect on the Earth’s climate system would seem to contradict the conclusion that there is widespread consensus that the Sun’s climate impact is negligible.
Below are the first 12 papers on the list. For the rest of the compilation, click here.

Scafetta and Willson, 2019     The consistent downward trending of the PMOD TSI composite is negatively correlated with the global mean temperature anomaly during 1980–2000. This has been viewed with favor by those supporting the CO2 anthropogenic global warming (CAGW) hypothesis since it would minimize TSI variation as a competitive climate change driver to CO2, the featured driver of the hypothesis during the period (cf.: [IPCC, 2013, Lockwood and Fröhlich, 2008]). .. Our summary conclusion is that the objective evidence produced by all of the independent TSI composites [3,5, 6, 9] agrees better with the cycle-by-cycle trending of the original ACRIM science team’s composite TSI that shows an increasing trend from 1980 to 2000 and a decreasing trend thereafter. The continuously downward trending of the PMOD composite and TSI proxy models is contraindicated. … PMOD’s modifications of the published ACRIM and ERB TSI records are questionable because they are based on conforming satellite observational data to proxy model predictions. … ACRIM shows a 0.46 W/m2 increase between 1986 and 1996 followed by a decrease of 0.30 W/m2 between 1996 and 2009. PMOD shows a continuous, increasing downward trend with a 1986 to 1996 decrease of 0.05 W/m2 followed by a decrease of 0.14 W/m2 between 1996 and 2009. The RMIB composite agrees qualitatively with the ACRIM trend by increasing between the 1986 and 1996 minima and decreasing slightly between 1996 and 2009. … ACRIM composite trending is well correlated with the record of global mean temperature anomaly over the entire range of satellite observations (1980–2018) [Scafetta. 2009]. The climate warming hiatus observed since 2000 is inconsistent with CO2 anthropogenic global warming (CAGW) climate models [Scafetta, 2013, Scafetta, 2017]. This points to a significant percentage of the observed 1980–2000 warming being driven by TSI variation [Scafetta, 2009, Willson, 2014, Scafetta. 2009]. A number of other studies have pointed out that climate change and TSI variability are strongly correlated throughout the Holocene including the recent decades (e.g., Scafetta, 2009,  Scafetta and Willson, 2014, Scafetta, 2013, Kerr, 2001, Bond et al., 2001, Kirkby, 2007, Shaviv, 2008, Shapiro et al., 2011, Soon and Legates, 2013, Steinhilber et al., 2012, Soon et al., 2014). .. The global surface temperature of the Earth increased from 1970 to 2000 and remained nearly stable from 2000 and 2018. This pattern is not reproduced by CO2 AGW climate models but correlates with a TSI evolution with the trending characteristics of the ACRIM TSI composite as explained in Scafetta [6,12, 27] and Willson [7].

Pei et al., 2019     During the period of 0–10,000 yr BP, China’s temperature has closely followed the solar forcing. The correlation is as high as 0.800 (p < 0.01) for the EOF-based reconstruction. … Similar to the North Atlantic SST, AO also plays an important role in China’s temperature (Zuo et al., 2015). NAO and AO are both suggested to influence the climate in East Asia by modifying the strength and location of the 200 hPa jet stream (Yang et al., 2004). The AO record of Darby et al. (2012) is based on sea-ice drift, which has a high resolution of 10–100 years and shows a close connection with solar activities.

Jiao et al., 2019     Regional climate change is affected by large-scale climate-forcing factors, such as solar activity and atmospheric–oceanic variability (Fang et al., 2010; Linderholm et al., 2015; Rydval et al., 2017). On the one hand, based on the MTM analysis results, the temperature changes in the study area are mainly influenced by the solar activity via the mean minimum temperature within approximately 11-year periods (Li et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2015). The tree-ring chronology was developed by samples of Schrenk spruce collected from the National Nature Reserve of the Western Tianshan Mountains. The mean minimum temperature in the growing season is the main and stable limiting climate factor. Therefore, the mean minimum temperature series in the growing season during 1680–2012 was reconstructed based on the STD chronology. In the past 333 years, the mean minimum temperature has roughly experienced three relatively cold periods and relatively warm stages (relatively cold periods: 1680–1707, 1802–1911 and 1935–1997; relatively warm periods: 1708–1801, 1912–1934 and 1998–2012). By analyzing similar trends in regional temperature changes in our reconstruction series with drought events, large volcanic eruptions and other reconstruction series around the study regions in Xinjiang and even large-scale regions, we found that the mean minimum temperature of the reconstruction was accurate and reliant. Moreover, the mean minimum temperature was influenced by solar activity (sunspots) and large-scale atmospheric–oceanic fluctuations (NAO, WPO, ENSO, TBO) based on the MTM and spatial correlation analysis.

Zharkova et al., 2019     Recently discovered long-term oscillations of the solar background magnetic field associated with double dynamo waves generated in inner and outer layers of the Sun indicate that the solar activity is heading in the next three decades (2019–2055) to a Modern grand minimum similar to Maunder one. On the other hand, a reconstruction of solar total irradiance suggests that since the Maunder minimum there is an increase in the cycle-averaged total solar irradiance (TSI) by a value of about 1–1.5 Wm−2 closely correlated with an increase of the baseline (average) terrestrial temperature. … These oscillations of the baseline solar magnetic field are found associated with a long-term solar inertial motion about the barycenter of the solar system and closely linked to an increase of solar irradiance and terrestrial temperature in the past two centuries. This trend is anticipated to continue in the next six centuries that can lead to a further natural increase of the terrestrial temperature by more than 2.5 °C by 2600.
Deke et al., 2019     The results provide robust evidence for synchronous ~500-yr cyclical changes in monsoon climate, human activity and prehistoric cultural development in the East Asian Monsoon (EAM) region during the Holocene. Six prosperous phases of Neolithic and Bronze Age cultures correspond approximately to warm-humid phases caused by a strengthened EASM, except for the first expansion of the Hongshan culture, which corresponds to the phase of strongest EASM in the middle Holocene. We suggest that humans responded to climatic fluctuations with different social strategies, leading to the rise and fall of early complex societies in the region.
(press release)      The climate theory casting new light on the history of Chinese civilisation … Researchers say that when 500-year-long sun cycles brought warmth, communities flourished, but when the Earth cooled, ancient societies collapsed. … Scientists say they have found evidence beneath a lake in northeastern China that ties climate change and 500-year sun cycles to ups and downs in the 8,000 years of Chinese civilisation. According to the study by a team at the Institute of Geology and Geophysics in Beijing published in the science journal Nature Communications this month, whenever the climate warmed, Chinese civilisation prospered and when it cooled, it declined.
Jin et al., 2019     We show that a strong 11-year solar cycle can excite a resonant response of the intrinsic leading mode of the AWM [Asian winter monsoon] variability, resulting in a significant signal of decadal variation. The leading mode, characterized by a warm Arctic and cold Siberia, responds to the maximum solar irradiance with a peculiar 3 to 4-year delay. We propose a new mechanism to explain this delayed response, in which the 11-year solar cycle affects the AWM via modulating Arctic sea ice variation during the preceding summer. At the peak of the accumulative solar irradiance (i.e., 4 years after the maximum solar irradiance), the Arctic sea ice concentration reaches a minimum over the Barents–Kara Sea region accompanied by an Arctic sea surface warming, which then persists into the following winter, causing Arctic high-pressure extend to the Ural mountain region, which enhances Siberian High and causes a bitter winter over the northern Asia.
Horikawa et al., 2019     The Mg/Ca-derived SST record clearly represented five warmer periods at 6200–6000, 4900–4500, 4200–3800, 2600–2100, and 900–400 cal. year BP, almost consistent with previously published diatom records. These warmer events also corresponded to the periods in which warm molluscan assemblages increased at the northern end of the TWC, suggesting that periods of higher SST can be seen as reflecting the increased volume transport of the TWC. We interpreted the results of a model study showing that higher solar irradiance provoked positive Arctic Oscillation (AO)-like spatial patterns and the negative phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) to mean that increased (reduced) TWC volume transport on the multi-centennial to millennial time scales was caused by high (low) solar insolation via a potential link between AO and PDO.
Kossobokov et al., 2019     On the Diversity of Long-Term Temperature Responses to Varying Levels of Solar Activity at Ten European Observatories … In the present paper, we propose a short but in-depth overview of a very specific topic, i.e., the statistical testing of hypotheses related to solar influence on regional temperature regimes at the time scale of several decades. … These new observations lead us to conclude that the climate in different regions presents different responses to variations in solar activity. Moreover, the distributions of the lower, middle, and higher quartiles of the temperature and pressure indices in solar cycles with high versus low activity are significantly different, providing further robust statistical confirmation to this conclusion (confidence level higher to much higher than 99% using the Kuiper test).
Wu et al., 2019     On the centennial to millennial time scale, the results of wavelet analysis and band‐pass filtering show that the occurrence and development of El Niño have also promoted a weaker EAWM after ~6.0 ka cal. BP, which is inversely correlated with the variation of the ca. 500‐year cycle originated from changes in solar output. These results imply that the climate transition in the mid‐Holocene is caused by the change of variations in solar activity and amplified by ocean circulation El Niño‐Southern Oscillation to influence the East Asian Monsoon system, especially the EAWM, and finally change the vegetation in Great Khingan Mountain Range.
(press release)     Lead scientist Dr Wu Jing, from the Key Laboratory of Cenozoic Geology and Environment at the Institute of Geology and Geophysics, part of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said the study had found no evidence of human influence on northern China’s warming winters. … The study found that winds from Arctic Siberia have been growing weaker, the conifer tree line has been retreating north, and there has been a steady rise in biodiversity in a general warming trend that continues today. It appears to have little to do with the increase in greenhouse gases which began with the industrial revolution, according to the researchers. As a result of the research findings, Wu said she was now more worried about cooling than warming.
Wang et al., 2019     Here we present the first high-resolution stable isotope (δ13C and δ18O) speleothem record from northern Laos spanning the Common Era (∼50 BCE to 1880 CE). The δ13C record reveals substantial centennialscale fluctuations primarily driven by local water balance. Notably, the driest period at our site occurred from ∼1280 to 1430 CE, during the time of the Angkor droughts, supporting previous findings that this megadrought likely impacted much of Mainland Southeast Asia. In contrast, variations in stalagmite δ18O reflect changes in rainfall upstream from our study site. Interestingly, the δ18O record exhibits a positive correlation with solar activity that persists after 1200 CE, contrary to the findings in previous studies. Solar-forced climate model simulations reveal that these δ18O variations may be driven by solar-forced changes in upstream rainout over the tropical Indian Ocean, which modify the δ18O of moisture transported to our study site without necessarily affecting local rainfall amount. We conclude that future rainfall changes in Mainland Southeast Asia are likely to be superimposed on multi-decadal to centennial-scale variations in background climate driven primarily by internal climate variability, whereas solar forcing may impact upstream rainout over the Indian Ocean.
Misios et al., 2019     The Pacific Walker Circulation (PWC) fluctuates on interannual and multidecadal timescales under the influence of internal variability and external forcings. Here, we provide observational evidence that the 11-y solar cycle (SC) affects the PWC on decadal timescales. We observe a robust reduction of east–west sea-level pressure gradients over the Indo-Pacific Ocean during solar maxima and the following 1–2 y. This reduction is associated with westerly wind anomalies at the surface and throughout the equatorial troposphere in the western/central Pacific paired with an eastward shift of convective precipitation that brings more rainfall to the central Pacific. We show that this is initiated by a thermodynamical response of the global hydrological cycle to surface warming, further amplified by atmosphere–ocean coupling, leading to larger positive ocean temperature anomalies in the equatorial Pacific than expected from simple radiative forcing considerations. The observed solar modulation of the PWC is supported by a set of coupled ocean–atmosphere climate model simulations forced only by SC irradiance variations. We highlight the importance of a muted hydrology mechanism that acts to weaken the PWC. Demonstration of this mechanism acting on the 11-y SC timescale adds confidence in model predictions that the same mechanism also weakens the PWC under increasing greenhouse gas forcing.
Bhargawa and Singh, 2019     Since the Sun is the main source of energy for our planet therefore even a slight change in its output energy can make a huge difference in the climatic conditions of the terrestrial environment. The rate of energy coming from the Sun (solar irradiance) might affect our climate directly by changing the rate of solar heating of the Earth and the atmosphere and indirectly by changing the cloud forming processes. … In our investigation, we have observed that the impact of solar irradiance on the global surface temperature level in next decade will increase by ∼4.7% while the global mean sea level will increase about 0.67%. In the meantime, we have noticed about 5.3% decrement in the global sea-ice extent for the next decade. In case of the global precipitation anomaly we have not observed any particular trend just because of the variable climatic conditions. We also have studied the effect of CO2 as anthropogenic forcing where we have observed that the global temperature in the next decade will increase by 2.7%; mean sea level will increase by 6.4%. Increasing abundance in CO2 will be responsible for about 0.43% decrease in the sea-ice extent while there will not be any change in the precipitation pattern.
Zaffar et al., 2019     This study shows that every value of El Nino-southern oscillation (ENSO) Cycles and Sunspot Cycles are strongly correlated to preceding values in both the self-similar and self-affine cases. Unit root test is applied to the tail parameter and the strength of long range-correlation of El Nino-southern oscillation (ENSO) and Sunspot Cycles confirms stationary behavior of the parameters. The variation of earth climatic has a strong influence in Sunspots Cycles and El Nino-southern oscillation (ENSO) Cycles. Sunspots and El Nino-southern oscillation (ENSO) have strong correlation with each other (Asma et  al. 2018). The El Nino-southern oscillation (ENSO) cycles influence on the variation of the parameter of local climate which depends on the changes in solar activity.

"Britain is to host a crunch climate conference next year at which the future direction of global efforts to avert the climate crisis will be determined, the government has confirmed. The COP26 meeting, under the auspices of the UN, will take place in Glasgow in December 2020, with about 30,000 delegates expected as well as leaders of most of the world’s governments, making it the biggest international summit to be hosted in the UK.  After months of behind-the-scenes preparations, the UK was confirmed as co-host with Italy, where some preparatory meetings will take place, when other countries signalled their acceptance on Tuesday. The announcement shines a spotlight on the UK’s diplomatic standing on the world stage after Brexit and will bring intense scrutiny of the British government’s actions on the climate emergency. Before her departure, one of Theresa May’s final acts as prime minister was to enshrine in law a commitment to ensure the country had net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, said: “The UK has just received a huge vote of confidence from our international partners. We’re ready to bring the world together to make sure we leave our previous environment in a better state for our children.” Kicking off the government’s global diplomatic push, which will encompass developing as well as developed countries, the Department for International Development said British overseas aid had helped poor and vulnerable nations cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 16m tonnes in the past eight years, the equivalent of taking 3m cars off the road for a year. These included projects to provide clean energy in Kenya, Rwanda and Mali, and helping farmers grow climate-resilient crops or put in measures to save water. Alok Sharma, the international development secretary, said: “This nomination [to host COP26] is testimony to the UK’s leading role in the fight against climate change. UK aid has helped millions of people in developing countries to access clean energy and prepare for the impacts of climate change.” Civil society groups and businesses also called for the UK to take action on its net-zero commitment as part of the hosting role. Tanya Steele, the chief executive of WWF UK, said: “This is a real opportunity for us to showcase our vision of a greener future, powered by renewable energy, with flourishing sustainable industries and a restored natural world. “But if we want other countries to follow our lead, we will have to be able to show that we have backed our bold commitments with concrete action.” Stephanie Pfeifer, the chief executive of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, said: “The UK should use its diplomatic influence to encourage other countries to make similar pledges [to reduce carbon to net zero] in the run-up to the summit to ensure it’s a success.” However, some experts are worried Brexit will distract ministers and officials from climate issues. The conference will be the most important on the climate since the Paris agreement was passed in 2015, because the future of the pledges countries made will be reviewed. Nations agreed to a legally binding commitment in Paris to keep global temperature rises to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, but also offered national pledges to cut or curb their greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Those pledges were insufficient to meet the 2C requirement, so governments will be expected to come up with more ambitious offerings in 2020. Progress made to date will also be assessed. Most countries, including the US, China, India and the UK, as well as the EU, have national or bloc-wide pledges to cut or curb greenhouse gas emissions growth by 2020, agreed before Paris, so auditing whether these are met will be a key aim. Probably the most watched effect on the talks, however, will be the outcome of the US presidential election, which takes place on 3 November 2020, weeks before the conference. Donald Trump has begun the process of withdrawing the US from the Paris agreement, but withdrawal cannot legally take place until 4 November next year."

But she quickly became disenchanted by the movement’s “cult-like” structures which did not tolerate questions. Recently she revealed her story. 

Hat-tip: EIKE
Sina began her environmental activism by joining a demonstration against coal power plants, organized by Greenpeace and WWF, before getting involved as a press spokesperson in the FFF movement in March; 2019.
In the interview, she reports on cult-like control, censorship, hostility and left-wing infiltration.
By November, 2019, she began questioning the movement. As press spokesperson, she says she recalls having an older organizer constantly standing at her side at the demonstrations to make sure she said “the right things” when interviewed by radio or television.
“No matter what was asked, it had to be answered like this or like that” and we had to “sound dramatic and to not express any doubts about it,” Sina tells GROSSE FREIHEIT TV (Great Freedom TV) in the interview.
Constantly watched
“We have to act immediately, otherwise things will go like so, and the world will fall apart if you don’t take to the streets, and those who don’t are to blame for the world collapsing and all such things that put pressure on people,” said Sina, explaining what the organizers expected the press spokeschildren to say to the media.

According to Sina:

One question from the press has always been very popular, and that is what you do yourself for climate protection. A very clear guideline was the answer that one should live vegan, plastic-free, seasonal and regional, as well as avoid car journeys and flights as far as possible. I believe, that is also the first thing I learned there.”

Began to have doubts
In the interview, the sharp-witted teen explains how she began to have doubts about the movement when the question of a CO2 tax came up and her father had doubts about it. This made Sina think about the implications of shutting down the coal power plants and the financial implications.
“The demands were so dogmatic and radical” that “they they could not really be implemented,” she says in the interview. She then explains how she researched the subject and found out that the 97% claimed consensus was bogus.
Insults and attacks…”Nazi” …”climate denier”
When her doubts and skepticism became known, she recounts how immediately she was accused of acting like a Nazi, and getting labelled a “climate denier” and “future destroyer”.  At that point she had had enough and ditched the movement.
“Cult character”
At the 20:35-mark, having been asked to describe how she sees the FFF movement, shes says: “In my view, it has a sort of cult character because you have to have that opinion. Otherwise you’ll be insulted out, if you will.”
She then adds: “They make demands without even thinking about solutions and thinking about the consequences of immediately exiting coal power.”
She adds: “High taxes isn’t going to buy the CO2 out of the air.”
Her advice: “Do a little research”
Later she describes how dissent is absolutely not tolerated by the movement in any way. At school some of the more extreme teachers “couldn’t understand” why she exited the movement and how she was confronted by other radical classmates: “If you don’t take part, then it will be your fault that none of us will have a future and we’ll all die.” She responded to them: “Just do a little research!”

Share this...FacebookTwitterNew research indicates that coral reef ecosystems off the coasts of Hawai’i (Terlouw et al., 2019) and in the Great Barrier Reef (Lønborg et al., 2019) are a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere.
Presuming that higher CO2 emissions lead to global warming, it can consequently be said that coral reefs are heating up the planet.

In addition to emitting CO2 (and adding to global CO2 emissions), coral reef communities are “acidifying” themselves.  Corals pump more CO2 into the water in which they live as they grow.

Counterintuitively, then, the rampant and ongoing “self-acidification” in coral reef communities is an indication that the reefs are healthy and thriving.

Image Source: New Scientist
Andreas Andersson of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, California, and his colleagues carefully monitored a coral reef in Bermuda for five years, and found that spikes in acidity were linked to increased reef growth.
“At first we were really puzzled by this,” says Andersson. “It’s completely the opposite to what we would expect in an ocean-acidification scenario.”
The researchers observed the chemistry of the water on the reef between 2007 and 2012. During that time, there were two sharp spikes in acidity – once in 2010 and again in 2011.
The team found that coral growth itself made the water more acidic as the corals sucked alkaline carbonate out of the water to build their skeletons. The corals also ate more food during these high-activity periods and pumped more CO2 into the water, increasing acidity further.

Perhaps the only way to prevent corals from acidifying the oceans, growing their carbon footprint, and heating up the planet is to foster increased incidences of coral bleaching events.
Peak bleaching decades, however, occurred in the 18th and 19th centuries.

Yes, coral reef communities pump CO2 into the atmosphere, acidify the oceans, and heat up the planet.
It’s important to emphasize, though, that just because coral reef ecosystems do it does not mean that humans should follow corals’ lead and do the same.

"Major oil and gas companies have invested $50bn (£40.6bn) in fossil fuel projects that undermine global efforts to avert a runaway climate crisis, according to a report. Since the start of last year, fossil fuel companies have spent billions on high-cost plans to extract oil and gas from tar sands, deepwater fields and the Arctic despite the risks to the climate and shareholder returns.  Carbon Tracker, a financial thinktank, found that ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell and BP each spent at least 30% of their investment in 2018 on projects that are inconsistent with climate targets, and would be “deep out of the money in a low-carbon world”. Andrew Grant, the author of the report, said: “Every oil major is betting heavily against a 1.5C world and investing in projects that are contrary to the Paris goals.” The study is the first to analyse individual projects to test whether they are compliant with a 1.5C world, and whether they would be financially sustainable in a low-carbon world. It found that none of the largest listed oil and gas companies are making investment decisions that are in line with global climate goals, and risk wasting $2.2tn (£1.8tn) by 2030 if governments take a tougher stance on carbon emissions. Last year Shell said it would spend $13bn on a liquefied natural gas project in Canada and ExxonMobil agreed to invest $2.6bn in the Aspen project in Canada, the first greenfield oil sands project in five years. “Investors should challenge companies’ spending on new fossil fuel production. The best way to both preserve shareholder value in the transition and align with climate change goals will be to focus on low-cost projects that will deliver the highest returns,” Grant said. The report contradicts the public rhetoric of many oil executives who have claimed to support the Paris goals and vowed to invest in renewable energy projects. A spokesperson for Shell said: “We agree that the world is not moving fast enough to tackle climate change. As the energy system evolves, so is our business, to provide the mix of products that our customers need.” A report from the UN Environment Programme has revealed that global investment in renewable energy projects over the last decade is on track to reach $2.6tn by the end of this year. The investment boom has almost quadrupled the world’s total renewable energy capacity from 414GW at the end of 2009 to an expected total of 1,650GW by the end of this year. Inger Andersen, the executive director of the UN Environment Programme, said: “Investing in renewable energy is investing in a sustainable and profitable future, as the last decade of incredible growth in renewables has shown.” The report, co-authored by BloombergNEF, showed that solar power projects led the rise in renewables. Solar power attracted around half of the total investment in renewables over the last decade and has grown from 25GW at the beginning of 2010 to an expected 638GW by the close of 2019. Jon Moore, the chief executive of BloombergNEF, said the sharp falls in the cost of electricity from wind and solar over recent years has “transformed the choice facing policymakers”. “These technologies were always low carbon and relatively quick to build. Now, in many countries around the world, either wind or solar is the cheapest option for electricity generation,” he said. However, Andersen warned that governments cannot be complacent about the growth of renewable energy if they hope to meet the UN’s climate targets. “Global power sector emissions have risen about 10% over this period. It is clear that we need to rapidly step up the pace of the global switch to renewables if we are to meet international climate and development goals,” she said. Renewable energy made up 12.9% of the world’s total electricity use last year, up from 11.6% the year before."

Share this...FacebookTwitterCOVID-19 has not only been a nightmare for the public worldwide, but especially for “climate crisis” alarmists who have seen their agenda disappear from the media radar. And it’s going to stay off the radar for quite some time. People can take only so much panic and restriction.
Once the COVID-19 crisis subsides, and it will in a few months, the global citizenry will be in absolutely no mood to keep on panicking. They’ll want to go back to the prosperity they previously enjoyed.
“Enough sacrifice and restrictions,” they’ll be saying.
Far lower urgency
There are several reasons the climate crisis isn’t going to come back soon.
First off, it’s human nature to address only dangers that are truly present. Though many believe there’s a climate crisis, it’s one that is perceived to be years, even decades, off into the future. So there’s no sense of real urgency like the immediate sort we’ve been seeing with COVID-19. So what if sea level rises 2 feet by 2100. I can move in 30 years – long before it ever gets here!
People will be sick and tired of panic
Secondly, by the time COVID-19 passes, citizens will be sick and tired of panicking, and they aren’t going to be in the mood for a continued high level panic over something far, far less urgent. They’ll have had enough of lock downs and sacrificing and aren’t going to be very open to sacrificing for the weather.
Too many people aren’t buying the flaky climate crisis “science”
A third reason is that the climate crisis is still highly uncertain and increasingly hotly disputed. Much of the science behind it is flimsy. While it has been crystal clear that COVID-19 is urgent, especially for the elderly, the climate crisis is fraught with huge uncertainties and flaky science. Too many people just aren’t buying it. They’re going to take the let’s-wait-and-see attitude before flying off the handle again.
The media aren’t going to keep up the high panic



Fourthly, the media can’t devote the same attention to the “climate crisis” that they did to COVID-19 simply because people would just tune them out, and rightly so. Enough is enough. People will want to get back to normalcy. Who in their right mind would want to spend the rest of his life in a state of panic like the alarmists propose?

Why would people — already fatigued by the COVID-19 panic — worry about a climate doomsday when summer is finally there?
And despite all the hype surrounding Greta and Fridays for Future, a recent study by the organization Media Matters, revealed that there was only 238 minutes of climate crisis coverage by major US networks in 2019!
So after COVID-19 subsides, the networks aren’t going to keep crying doomsday. They know they’ll be tuned out totally if they do.
The climate crisis had gotten little attention

Chart: Media Matters
Gotten so old
Moreover the climate warnings have been going on more than 30 years now and people had been tuning them out already, and for good reason. Life on the planet by most measures is far better today. All the dire predictions made in the 1990s and 2000s never came to pass.
Political suicide
Finally politicians will be very wary about calling for more pain to combat a distant, dubious threat. Doing so after going through the pain of COVID-19 would be tantamount to political suicide.
Dictatorship as the last hope for the climate crisis?
“As heretical as it may sound, there are valid questions to be raised about whether a democratic system with regular elections is suited to dealing with an issue that requires short-term sacrifice for long-term benefits,” wrote Joe Wiggins, a researcher in fund management.
Good luck with that.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn a new information video at FMD’s TV-Channel, man-made climate warming skeptic Günther Aigner analyzes winter temperatures at four German mountain stations over 1000 m altitudes at different locations in Germany.
Hat-tip: Die kalte Sonne here.
The stations are located at Feldberg (1493 m) in southwest Germany, Brocken in northern Germany (1152 m), Fichtelberg in eastern Germany (1215 m) and Großer Arber in southeast Germany (1456 m). These 4 stations are sited well away from urban influences.
Oscillating trend
Aigner clearly highlights the strong variability of temperatures, which we see do not correlate at all with rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations.

The clearly oscillating trend seen at the four stations over the past decades likely have much more to do with the natural AMO and NAO ocean cycles, which directly impact Western Europe’s winter weather patterns.
Today as cool as 40 years ago!
The chart presented below shows the mean winter temperature of the 4 stations combined. The green curve is the 10-year smoothing.

Chart cropped here. 
Today we see that Germany’s winter temperatures are just as cool as they were 40 years ago and that the linear trend showing a slight warming is “statistically insignificant”.
German mountains cooling over past 30 years
Aigner concludes that over the past 30 winters, the four mountains stations have shown a cooling of 0.8°C. The Feldberg station in the Black Forest has seen no winter trend at all over the past 50 years.
Aigner notes that climate change has not been impacting the German ski industry and that there has been “a growing gap between the public perception and the official data and that this needs to be investigated.
German warming due to more sunshine hours
Aigner does remind, however, that Germany’s annual mean temperature indeed has been rising, but that the phenomenon is due to hotter summers that are correlated with considerably more sunshine hours.
Germany hasn’t warmed because of CO2, but because naturally changing weather patterns have led to more sunshine in a country that is otherwise known for its gray, dreary weather. Most Germans would welcome that change and see no catastrophe there.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA new 5680-year tree-ring temperature reconstruction for southern South America (Lara et al., 2020) reveals (a) no clear warming trend in recent decades, and (b) the 18th and 19th centuries (and many centennial-scale periods from the last 5680 years) had much warmer temperatures than today.

Image Source: Lara et al., 2020
In addition to finding modern temperature changes in southern South America fall well within the range of natural variability in the context of the last 5680 years, Lara et al. (2020) assess solar forcing to have contributed to climate variations for this region of the Southern Hemisphere.
The authors find CO2 fertilization can explain trees’ improved water use efficiency and tree-ring growth in general; this affects the capacity for tree-rings to be a proxy for long-term temperature variability.
They emphasize this composite tree-ring record is “the longest in the Southern Hemisphere.”
Lara et al., 2020
“The most outstanding features in the reconstruction presented here are two major warm periods between 3140–2800 BC and 70 BC – 150 AD (5159–4819 and 2089–1869 years ago, respectively, counted from 2019 to facilitate comparisons with glacier records based on 10Be dated moraines). During these warm periods, no glacier advances have been reported for Patagonia (Aniya, 2013; Kaplan et al., 2016; Strelin et al., 2014, Fig. 5A).”
“Reconstructed mean maximum temperature in our record shows warmer conditions during the 19th century (1780–1880 AD) than in the 20th century (Fig. 3D and Figs. 3D and S3). This pattern coincides with above average spring-summer temperatures during the 19th century, reconstructed from a completely independent 600-year record based on varved sediments from El Plomo Lake, Patagonia at 47° S (Elbert et al., 2015; Fig. S3, r = 0.22, p < 0.001, for the period 1780–2009). This is the warmest period in the entire El Plomo record (Elbert et al., 2015). Particularly warm summer conditions in the 1800s were also reported for Laguna Escondida in western Patagonia at ∼45° S (Elbert et al., 2013) and for northern Argentinean Patagonia (Villalba, 1990). The 1775–1804 period has also been described as the warmest 30-year period in a millennial reconstruction for South America, south of 20° S (Neukom et al., 2011).”

“The subdued warming pattern during recent decades in our record is consistent with reports from instrumental records for southern Chile (38°–48°S), where there are no clear temperature patterns or significant trends reported over the period 1979–2009 (Falvey and Garreaud, 2009).”
Consistent with the patterns documented in this paper, low frequency reconstructed cold temperature anomalies for the NH and periods of minimal solar activity were variable with periods of coincidences and discrepancies during the last 1200 years (Anchukaitis et al., 2017). Changes in large scale NH circulation are thought to provide a possible mechanism for these differences (Anchukaitis et al., 2017). The two major periods with positive anomalies in our reconstruction (3140–2800 BC and 70 BC-150 AD), coincide with positive anomalies of solar irradiance, but the deviations in the TSI are proportionally smaller in the latter period (Fig. 5A).
“A strong CO2 fertilization effect has been the main explanation for the significant increase in water-use efficiency (WUE) reported for Northern Hemisphere temperate and boreal forests over the recent two decades (Keenan et al., 2013).”
“The increasing growth trend and decreasing isotope discrimination in Fitzroya have been attributed to a raise in photosynthetic rates, which has been caused by increased CO2 and/or higher surface radiation, the latter associated with a reduction in cloudiness in a high precipitation area (Urrutia-Jalabert et al., 2015a). In the eastern slope of the northern Patagonian Andes, Argentina, under lower rainfall and cloudiness than in the Chilean western slope, a marked increase in Fitzroya tree-ring growth during the 20th century has also been recorded and attributed to increased CO2 concentration (Lavergne et al., 2018). The coincident Fitzroya growth patterns in two areas of contrasting cloud cover is an additional support for the attribution of CO2 fertilization in this species.”
For good measure, Lara et al., (2020) point out that “a cooling trend has been reported along the Pacific coast (17° – 37° S) of South America for the periods 1979–2006 and 1981–2012 (Falvey and Garreaud, 2009; Hartmann et al., 2013).”
This cooling record is consistent with instrumental records from the dozens of temperature stations all across the central and southern regions of South America which also show cooling/no warming in recent decades (Lansner and Pepke-Pedersen, 2018).

We’ve been hearing much fake news about the Australian bush fires supposedly having been caused by man-made climate change. Yet it has emerged that Australian authorities were warned years ago that poor land management practices were in fact escalating the risk of devastating fires, according to an expert.
Forest fuel level highest in 1000 years
In 2015, bush fire scientist David Packham warned of a “huge blaze threat” and urged an “increase in fuel reduction burns”.
“Forest fuel levels had climbed to their most dangerous level in thousands of years,” wrote Darren Gray here in 2015. Today the public is being misled by climate alarmists and the media on the real causes of the devastating bush fires now taking place.
In fact NASA data shows that the area burned by global wildfires dropped by 25% since 2003, according to the Global Warming Policy Forum (GWPF)

Misleading temperature trends
Unfortunately, deception is not only taking place in the communication of Australian bush fires, but also authorities (NASA GISS) are grossly misleading the public in terms of temperature trends in Australia.

What follows are the curves of six Australian station that go back to the late 19th century. The comparator shows the plots of GISS “unadjusted data compared to the “homogenized” data:

Data: NASA GISS
Before the homogenization, the unadjusted data from 4 of the 6 stations showed cooling. 
But after NASA changed the data, the cooling disappeared and all 6 stations showed warming!
Looking at the three stations Yamba. Moruya and Darwin, here we see that NASA dropped the early part of the temperature record (because they showed warm temperatures?). The result of course is a greater warming trend.
Look at NASA GISS data plots for Darwin Airport for example. See the huge differences between the versions:

So whenever people claim warming is man-made, they are right. But it’s not so much because of the CO2 emitted by man, but rather it is because of the statistical fudging of data at NASA GISS.

"The Bahamas, for those who live there, is simply a place to call home. For many Americans, it’s a dream vacation spot. But Hurricane Dorian turned that dream into a nightmare. And the worst part is this is only the beginning. Because unless we confront the climate crisis, warming will turn more and more of our fantastic landscapes, cities we call paradise and other dream destinations into nightmarish hellscapes.  While the science has yet to come in on the specifics of just how much worse climate change made Dorian, we already know enough to say that warming worsened the damage. Because it’s not a coincidence that Dorian was one of the strongest landfalling storms ever recorded in the Atlantic, with the strongest sustained peak winds east of Florida, and the strongest ever to hit the Bahamas. This comes less than a year after Florida withstood the first landfalling category 5 hurricane in decades, on 5 October – the latest ever in the season for a storm that strong. On a basic physics level, we know that warm waters fuel hurricanes, and Dorian was strengthened by waters well above average temperatures. The fact that climate change has heated up our oceans means Dorian was stronger than it would have been had we not spent the past 150 years dumping carbon pollution into the atmosphere. Sea surface temperatures were more than 1C warmer in the region where Dorian formed and strengthened than they were before we started burning fossil fuels. Empirically, there is a roughly 7% increase in maximum sustained wind speeds of the strongest storms for each 1C of warming. Since destructive potential is proportional to the third power of the wind speed, that corresponds to a 23% increase in potential wind damage. We saw that wind damage in the heartbreaking scenes of total devastation that have come in from the Bahamas. We know that the warmer air gets, the more moisture it can hold – and then turn into flooding rains in a storm like this. And we know that as climate change has melted glaciers and ice around the world, that water has gone into the oceans. The extra water, along with the expansion of water as it’s warmed, means that sea levels have been raised. That means when a storm like Dorian makes landfall, there’s more water for its storm surge, already bolstered by stronger winds, to push further inland. All that extra water makes hurricanes even more deadly, since it’s generally not the wind but the water that kills people. So although Dorian’s 220mph gusts were incredibly dangerous (and sped up thanks to climate change), it was the 20-plus feet of storm surge and torrential rains that were the most destructive elements. But there are two other ways that warming has probably worsened Dorian’s damage. One is that all that warm water allowed for the storm to ramp up quickly, undergoing what is known as rapid intensification as it exploded from a moderate category 2 to extreme category 5 over just two days. A recent study has shown that this is getting more common because of climate change, and indeed the past few years have seen many similar examples of this effect in action. Dorian was the fourth category 5 storm in just the last four years. So while climate change is making it so hurricanes can spin up quickly, it may also be slowing down how fast hurricanes move. Instead of moving across a coast and dissipating as normal, in recent years these storms are lingering longer in place, which means more flooding as the water piles up. For example, that’s exactly what we saw in Houston during Harvey, and in North Carolina during Florence. Had Dorian been moving at a regular pace of a few miles an hour, the devastation in the Bahamas would have been much less severe. But because it sat in place, basically stationary, the damage has been catastrophic. Again, Dorian is far from unique in moving slowly, as a study last year found a 10% decrease in speed for storms like this globally, while a similar study found a 17% decrease along the east coast of the US. While neither of these studies directly tie that slowdown to climate change, the theory that climate change is changing the jet stream in ways that would lead to stalling storms (a phenomenon one of us has researched) is growing increasingly convincing. When all these factors combine in one storm, as it has for Dorian, it is truly a nightmare scenario – and a preview of the climate crisis to come. The only question is whether we have the foresight to address it. Michael Mann is distinguished professor of atmospheric science at Pennsylvania State University. His most recent book, with Tom Toles, is The Madhouse Effect: How Climate Change Denial Is Threatening Our Planet, Destroying Our Politics, and Driving Us Crazy. Andrew Dessler is a professor of atmospheric sciences and holder of the Reta A Haynes chair of geosciences at Texas A&M University.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNew IPCC report under doubt: models out-of-control and a new hockey stick
By Die kalte Sonne
[German text translated/edited by P Gosselin]
IPCC authors “politically handpicked”
The IPCC climate status report serves as an important reference for climate policy and public discussion. However, very few people are aware that the authors of the report are politically hand-picked. Although anyone can apply as an author to the national IPCC committees, the selection process is not transparent behind closed doors. The IPCC had to take a lot of criticism for this, but persists in its exclusionary line.
Thus critics have no chance to participate in the climate referee reports.
Huge uncertainty persists
The 6th IPCC report (Assessment Report 6, AR6) is currently being prepared. The first round of reviews has been completed and work on the second draft is in full swing. One of the central topics of each report is the warming effect of CO2, so-called CO2 climate sensitivity. Hardly anything has changed in the last 30 years. The value is still very poorly known and ranges from “we have to keep an eye on it” to “catastrophically strong warming”. In numbers: 1.5°C to 4.5°C warming per CO2 doubling.
Climate sensitivity in the lower range
In recent years it has become increasingly clear that the value is probably located in the lower half of the IPCC range. So it will be interesting to see how the AR6 deals with this. But don’t hold your breath because the IPCC seems to be true to its alarmist line, despite many published references to a lower warming by CO2.
Model Chaos
Paul Voosen spoke on this in Science on 16 April 2019. The IPCC modelers had “improved” some processes in their climate simulations and were then quite surprised that the models suddenly ran much hotter than before. The CO2 climate sensitivity was now suddenly above the range previously thought possible, namely 5°C. The climate sensitivity of the models was suddenly much higher than before. Wow! The alarmists celebrated a feast of joy. However, more serious colleagues obviously threw sand in the alarmist gears and reported concerns.
Excerpt from Voosen’s article:
New climate models predict a warming surge 
For nearly 40 years, the massive computer models used to simulate global climate have delivered a fairly consistent picture of how fast human carbon emissions might warm the world. But a host of global climate models developed for the United Nations’s next major assessment of global warming, due in 2021, are now showing a puzzling but undeniable trend. They are running hotter than they have in the past. Soon the world could be, too.
In earlier models, doubling atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) over preindustrial levels led models to predict somewhere between 2°C and 4.5°C of warming once the planet came into balance. But in at least eight of the next-generation models, produced by leading centers in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and France, that “equilibrium climate sensitivity” has come in at 5°C or warmer. Modelers are struggling to identify which of their refinements explain this heightened sensitivity before the next assessment from the United Nations’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). But the trend “is definitely real. There’s no question,” says Reto Knutti, a climate scientist at ETH Zurich in Switzerland. “Is that realistic or not? At this point, we don’t know.
[…] Many scientists are skeptical, pointing out that past climate changes recorded in ice cores and elsewhere don’t support the high climate sensitivity—nor does the pace of modern warming. The results so far are “not sufficient to convince me,” says Kate Marvel, a climate scientist at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York City. In the effort to account for atmospheric components that are too small to directly simulate, like clouds, the new models could easily have strayed from reality, she says. “That’s always going to be a bumpy road.”
“Modelers at a loss”
CO2 climate sensitivity remains uncertain, modelers are at a loss. They had planned everything so beautifully for the AR6. Shortly before the end of the work, they quickly installed a new aerosolset, which then knocked everything down. The models suddenly showed hardly any warming for the 20th century. Ouch!
Perhaps the modelers were closer to the truth than they had thought, since there was now plenty of room for natural climatic factors, which they had previously set to zero as a precaution. So the models were completely changed again. And that finally led to the crazy high values of 5°C per CO2 doubling. Read for yourself:
Late in the model’s development cycle, however, the NCAR group incorporated an updated data set on emissions of aerosols
The aerosol data threw everything off when the model simulated the climate of the 20th century, it now showed hardly any warming. “It took us about a year to work that out,” says NCAR’s Andrew Gettelman, who helped lead the development of the model. But the aerosols may play a role in the higher sensitivity that the modelers now see, perhaps by affecting the thickness and extent of low ocean clouds. “We’re trying to understand if other [model developers] went through the same process,” Gettelman says.”
What consequences does the modeling chaos have for AR6?
In assessing how fast climate may change, the next IPCC report probably won’t lean as heavily on models as past reports did, says Thorsten Mauritsen, a climate scientist at Stockholm University and an IPCC author. It will look to other evidence as well, in particular a large study in preparation that will use ancient climates and observations of recent climate change to constrain sensitivity.”

“Total failure by climate models”
The AR6 will not be able to rely on the simulations and must therefore focus more on other areas of argumentation. But one thing is as certain as an “amen” in Church: The IPCC will claim that the temperature forecasts have become much more reliable than in the previous report, despite the total failure of the climate models. Although this makes no sense at all, it is politically necessary.
The way out: The new hockey stick curve that PAGES2k was able to publish in Nature Geoscience just in time, at the end of July 2019.
:

Figure: Global temperature reconstruction of the last 2000 years according to PAGES2k 2019.
If you thought Michael Mann’s hockey stick had suffered its final blow recently, then you are mistaken. Fact is: A new hockey stick was born in July 2019. Exactly to be used in the IPCC report. It is rumored that the curve was already included in the first draft of the AR6, although it wasn’t even released then. Mysterious.
MWP only 0.3°C warmer than Little Ice Age?
The Medieval Warm Period is ironed flat and is only 0.3°C warmer than the Little Ice Age. Wow. Are these the “ancient climates” which Voosen addresses in his contribution and form the new basis of argumentation?
PAGES2k shortcomings
A closer look at the PAGES2k database reveals a number of shortcomings. First, a large number of tree rings are used, of which only a few have been formally published as case studies. Example: The study uses tree rings from the French Maritime Alps, although a specialist publication on the region clearly advises against using such tree rings there as temperature proxies.
This is not an isolated case. If one goes through the PAGES2k database in detail, one finds a whole series of dubious practices, which were obviously overlooked by the peer review. Read about them in the following papers:

Authors ignoring important publications
It is also noticeable that the PAGES2k paper does not cite any of the recent publications on the medieval climate anomaly, although the medieval climate is one of the most important topics in the area of palaeoclimatology. At least two of the publications were accessible to PAGES2k authors (others appeared later), but were ignored for unknown reasons.  The papers were able to demonstrate medieval warming throughout the southern hemisphere. Some smaller areas also cooled at the same time, similar to today’s active temperature seesaws and coastal upwelling areas.
Questionable database
In the northern hemisphere the Medieval Warm Period was always known. In this respect, it is an absolute mystery as to how the new hockey stick fix came about, if not through a questionable database.
Conclusion: “climate chaos”
It is time for the IPCC to open up to criticism. The climate models are out of control, as are the paleo-climatic reconstructions. What remains is climate chaos. It is time for a scientifically sustainable new beginning in which criticism is seriously heard and integrated. The exclusion of critics was a historic mistake that is now falling on the IPCC’s feet.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA new reconstruction for SE Greenland (1796-2013) shows temperatures have risen and fallen without any hockey-stick-like trajectories for the last 200+ years. Temperatures were warmer than today in the 1920s and 1940s and even briefly during the 1800s.
If rising CO2 concentrations are a driver of Arctic warming, the 19th and 20th centuries should presumably have been much colder than today.
A new study (Wangner et al., 2020) instead finds there were:
(a) warming and cooling episodes of multiple degrees per decade throughout the last ~215 years in southeast Greenland;
(b) decadal periods in the 1800s were occasionally warmer than 2013; and
(c) more sustained warming in the 1920s and 1940s than during the 21st century.

"The Seventh-day Adventist church in the US adheres historically to vegetarianism, in large part to the teachings of a co-founder of the church – Ellen G White – who advocated for meat-free diet habits following a prophetic vision. Mrs White apparently thought eating animal flesh would “excite and strengthen the lower passions” and had “the tendency to deaden the moral powers”. For almost a decade from the late 19th century a slice of America was marketed and brought up on meat substitutes such as Nuteena, a peanut-based loaf, along with Wham, Tuno, FriChick and Big Franks. While there has always been a market for growing numbers of vegetarians and vegans worldwide, the cause of meat-free diets has been given in recent years a rocket boost, not by religion but by reason. Diet is among lifestyle changes urgently needed if developed nations are to have a hope of meeting targets for reduced carbon emissions, a must to halt global heating. Every environmentalist and a great many ordinary people – including plenty of non-vegetarians – know that grains, vegetables and pulses including soya ought to soon form a far larger share of the typical western diet than they do at present. Industrialised agriculture and livestock farming are massively carbon-intensive activities. While the UN estimates they cause 23% of global emissions, critics believe this is an underestimate and the true total is far higher.  Last week KFC (formerly Kentucky Fried Chicken) became the latest fast food giant to announce that it is working on new products based on meat substitutes: in this case, “Beyond Fried Chicken”, a vegan nugget developed in partnership with California-based company Beyond Meat. Following Burger King’s launch this year of the meat-free Whopper, with ingredients supplied by Beyond Meat’s main competitor, Impossible Foods, the KFC announcement confirms what was already clear: there is real momentum, and money, behind the growth of plant-based alternatives to meat. Veganism in the UK is nothing new. But for some people it is changing our food landscape too fast. Last year the bakery chain Greggs faced criticism for selling a vegan sausage roll filled with meat-free Quorn. When a row between food writer Selene Nelson and Waitrose magazine editor William Sitwell exploded into headlines after Mr Sitwell sent such a rude reply to a proposal for a vegan recipe series, he resigned. It is ridiculous to treat shoppers for pastry snacks as warriors in a culture war. The structural shifts required to address the climate crisis will not be made in bakeries. The countries that drove the global rise in the consumption of animal products in the past are not the ones that will do so in future. But that doesn’t mean the rich world can go on eating beef and lamb with impunity, any more than we can continue to fly around the world without thinking about the harm that air traffic entails. Instead, we should take heart from the instances in which behaviour change is a message that consumers are willing to consider (the reduction in plastic bag use is another). Greggs’ shares jumped more than 13% between February and March this year, and the company is working on a vegan version of its steak bake. Bring it on. "

"Britain has one of the world’s best capabilities for dealing with the climate crisis but is failing to make use of it. That is the stark view of leading expert Baroness Brown, a member of the UK Committee on Climate Change. “We have the ingredients to do good things in response to climate change but are not making use of them,” she warned last week.  Brown, who chairs the CCC’s adaptation sub-committee, said little progress had been made in planning to protect farmland and wildlife from intense storms and changing weather systems, or tackle health threats from rising heat – with grim short-term political consequences.  The UK has pledged to persuade other governments at the UN climate change summit in New York this month to commit more to adaptation. But Bob Ward of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment said: “Britain’s failure to adapt to our changing climate could severely undermine efforts to persuade other countries to invest more in resilience. The UK may have a good track record of helping poor countries to become more resilient but we are not doing enough. The country needs to lead by example.” The UK is bidding to host another international summit, that is to be held in December 2020, the fifth anniversary of the Paris climate agreement. “If the UK wants to host that crucial summit, which will dictate the path we take to combating global warming, we will need to be seen to be doing a lot more about climate change,” added Ward. The nation’s failure to adapt to changing conditions was underlined this summer when severe flooding crippled train schedules, temperatures reached record levels and residents of Whaley Bridge, in Derbyshire, were evacuated after heavy rain damaged a dam on a nearby reservoir. Much worse is predicted for the next few decades but little is being done to protect the nation’s infrastructure - such as adapting care homes and hospitals so residents and patients do not suffer as temperatures soar or protecting coastal towns against rising sea levels.  “Yet we also possess powerful agencies like the Met Office,” said Brown. “It is developing detailed climate predictions for regions with an accuracy of a few kilometres. But we are not making use of these capabilities.” In fact, the priority given to adaptation to these threats has been eroded over the past 10 years. “We have been distracted by Brexit,” Brown added. She pointed to pressures on the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, which is in charge of ensuring Britain adapts to the climate crisis but has been concentrating on finding replacements for the EU common agricultural policy and dealing with other Brexit-related issues. In July, the CCC warned that the country was not prepared for even a 2C rise in temperatures, let alone more extreme warming. “Many policies still lack a basic acknowledgement of climate change, while others make a passing mention but have no associated actions to reduce risk.”"
"Australia’s minister responsible for drought and natural disasters, David Littleproud, has said that he doesn’t “know if climate change is manmade”. Clarifying earlier comments that the question is “irrelevant” when considering the Coalition government’s response to intensifying bushfires, he told Guardian Australia he was unsure about the causes of the climate crisis but wanted to give the country the tools to adapt.  The remarks by the minister for water resources, drought, natural disaster and emergency management are likely to anger political opponents, including the Greens who have targeted Littleproud and fellow members of the National party for refusing to acknowledge a link between human-induced climate change and bushfires. Littleproud’s position was supported by the Nationals deputy leader, Bridget McKenzie, the minister for resources and northern Australia, Matt Canavan, and the environment minister, Sussan Ley, all of who denied knowledge of or downplayed the link. Early spring bushfires in Queensland may go on for weeks, authorities said, while firefighters on Tuesday were battling more than 50 fires in New South Wales. The overall fire danger index has increased for most of southern Australia over the past 40 years and the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre says the trend is expected to continue. Does climate change cause bushfires? The link between rising greenhouse gas emissions and increased bushfire risk is complex but, according to major science agencies, clear. Climate change does not create bushfires, but it can and does make them worse. A number of factors contribute to bushfire risk, including temperature, fuel load, dryness, wind speed and humidity.  What is the evidence on rising temperatures?  The Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO say Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910 and temperatures will increase in the future. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says it is extremely likely increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases since the mid-20th century is the main reason it is getting hotter. The Bushfire and Natural Hazards research centre says the variability of normal events sits on top of that. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk. What other effects do carbon emissions have? Dry fuel load - the amount of forest and scrub available to burn - has been linked to rising emissions. Under the right conditions, carbon dioxide acts as a kind of fertiliser that increases plant growth.  So is climate change making everything dryer?  Dryness is more complicated. Complex computer models have not found a consistent climate change signal linked to rising CO2 in the decline in rain that has produced the current eastern Australian drought. But higher temperatures accelerate evaporation. They also extend the growing season for vegetation in many regions, leading to greater transpiration (the process by which water is drawn from the soil and evaporated from plant leaves and flowers). The result is that soils, vegetation and the air may be drier than they would have been with the same amount of rainfall in the past. What do recent weather patterns show? The year coming into the 2019-20 summer has been unusually warm and dry for large parts of Australia. Above average temperatures now occur most years and 2019 has been the fifth driest start to the year on record, and the driest since 1970. Is arson a factor in this year's extreme bushfires? Not a significant one. Two pieces of disinformation, that an “arson emergency”, rather than climate change, is behind the bushfires, and that “greenies” are preventing firefighters from reducing fuel loads in the Australian bush have spread across social media. They have found their way into major news outlets, the mouths of government MPs, and across the globe to Donald Trump Jr and prominent right-wing conspiracy theorists. NSW’s Rural Fire Service has said the major cause of ignition during the crisis has been dry lightning. Victoria police say they do not believe arson had a role in any of the destructive fires this summer. The RFS has also contradicted claims that environmentalists have been holding up hazard reduction work. On Monday, Littleproud told ABC’s Radio National that Australia has been “adapting to a changing climate since we first settled this country and we’ll have to continue to do that and do that with the best science we’ve got available”. When asked whether human-induced climate change is making bushfires more intense, Littleproud replied: “We’re adapting to it as the climate continues to change and we’ll continue to equip our service workers … Whether it’s manmade or not is irrelevant.” The minister suggested there were “extremes from both sides” of the debate which should be about “do we want to breathe healthy air”. He said his job was to ensure emergency services “are given the tools and resources they need, [and] they have the science to understand that these events could become more severe”. Asked by Guardian Australia why he had avoided taking a position on the effect of manmade climate change, Littleproud replied: “I don’t know if climate change is manmade. “I’m about practical outcomes, whether that’s about having a cleaner environment or giving farmers and emergency services the right tools to adapt,” he said. “I am responsible for making sure we have the tools we need to adapt to a changing climate.” On Monday, the Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, used Senate question time to target Littleproud for his original answer, suggesting he was in effect dismissing the concerns of emergency services chiefs who have warned of climate change’s contribution to fires. The agriculture minister, Bridget McKenzie, rebuked Di Natale for “politicising bushfires which right now are affecting landholders, homes, environmental assets and farmers in communities in Queensland and north-east NSW”. McKenzie – answering on behalf of Littleproud – said the minister and she had been “very upfront … about the fact that the climate is changing”. “There is variability around the climate.” Asked if she accepted that human-induced climate change is making bushfires worse, McKenzie replied: “Our government has made very clear that we take climate change seriously.” On Tuesday Di Natale repeated the tactic – this time targeting Canavan, who again accused the Greens of using the tragedy in “combustible fashion” to further the party’s own political cause. Canavan quoted a NSW environment department report which suggested there was “considerable uncertainty” of the impact of climate change on bushfire risk, although the report concluded it will likely increase bushfire risk. Canavan said the Liberal-National Coalition supported “sensible responses to climate change that included support for the high-quality coal and gas that we produce in this country”. “It is through the high-quality production of energy that we will respond to climate change and reduce emissions,” he said. Ley told ABC Radio that she doesn’t know “what caused this particular fire on this particular day”. “We have always lived on a continent which has been ravaged by fires, I am not going to become an expert on what is causing the fires,” she said. “I am sure it is related to climate change, to what degree and under what circumstances, and what actions we could be taking, there is a whole range of other conversations around that.” Earlier on Tuesday, four Coalition MPs raised the issue of drought and natural disasters in the joint party room, urging practical options to help regional businesses including shops that are not eligible for drought assistance. Several others raised the issue of insurance in north Queensland, which is subject to monsoonal troughs and severe tropical cyclones. The MPs complained of exorbitant premium rises of between 300% and 500% and argued the situation is a market failure with insurers warning it is no longer profitable to insure areas including Townsville. The MPs suggested reducing regulatory barriers to encourage smaller insurers or mutuals to offer insurance. Scott Morrison directed the assistant treasurer, Michael Sukkar, to meet northern Queensland MPs; Sukkar said he was already working with the competition regulator on the issue."

The law is loved and hated by many. While activists like Claudia Kemfert wish that the lavish subsidies would get expanded even further, others have different views on the situation.
Cost explosion
Former environment minister Jürgen Trittin’s scoop of ice cream, the equivalent amount the EEG was supposed to cost German citizens each month (about 1 euro), has become a running gag. Examples are Volker Andres from ZDF German public television and Daniel Wetzel of news daily WELT.
Andres:
And something else is going wrong: The EEG, which is almost unchanged in its system, sends the wrong price signal to us consumers. Green electricity costs around 30 cents per kilowatt hour. The pure electricity production is between four and eight cents, depending on the plant and source”.
Wetzel:

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




Also because financially interested lobby groups stylized the EEG as a panacea and drew all political attention to this rich cornucopia, the greening of the other consumer sectors failed to materialize.”
For years, the EEG remunerated electricity production volumes at any level regardless of demand. This introduced a kind of ton ideology into energy policy: only the masses of green kilowatt hours produced counted. The fact that it must also be possible to transport, store and use them somehow became a minor matter.”
Today the EEG is of course costing consumers exorbitantly more than just the value of a scoop of ice cream each month.
“According to figures from the comparison and brokerage portal Verivox, 86 utilities have announced average price increases of 8.1 percent for the months February to April,” wrote Germany’s flagship Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) here. “For a family with an annual consumption of 4000 kilowatt hours, this would mean additional costs of around 100 euros per year.”
Costly, destructive and unhealthy
Not only are Germans paying among the highest electricity rates in the world, but the supply has become unstable, the landscape has become littered with turbines that operate sporadically, kill birds, destroy natural biotopes and make people sick with their low frequency emissions.

"According to research published last week by US scientists, hajj is set to become a danger zone. As soon as next year, they say, summer days in Mecca could exceed the “extreme danger” heat-stress threshold. The news comes just weeks after over 2 million people completed their journey of a lifetime. The environmental threat to the holy pilgrimage is a panic button for British Muslims like me, signaling that the climate crisis is endangering an age-old sacred rite. Hajj is a pillar of Islam that I’ve yet to undertake, and the physical endurance required will only become more gruelling in coming decades – scientists predict that heat and humidity levels during hajj will exceed the extreme danger threshold 20% of the time from 2045 and 2053, and 42% of the time between 2079 and 2086.  Environmental stewardship may well be advocated by my faith – the Quran states that humans are appointed as “caretakers of the Earth” and the prophet Muhammad organised the planting of trees and created conservation areas called hima – but it hasn’t mobilised Muslims on a mass scale for what the world needs now: a global eco-jihad. Fazlun Khalid, founder of Islamic Foundation for Ecology and Environmental Sciences and author of Signs on the Earth: Islam, Modernity and the Climate Crisis, has been on a green mission for over 35 years, but his biggest challenge has been to motivate Muslims. “Islam is inherently environmental, but modernity has induced all of us to distance ourselves from nature. The reason I don’t give up is my grandchildren – what kind of planet will they inherit? How can they perform hajj under those conditions?” Khalid previously gathered a team of scholars and academics who drafted the Islamic declaration on climate change adopted at the International Islamic climate change symposium in Istanbul in 2015 (an event co-sponsored by Islamic Relief, a global charity that is again calling on Muslims to take action now if they want to safeguard the pilgrimage for future generations). Maria Zafar of Islamic Relief UK said: “Hajj has physically demanding outdoor rituals which can become hazardous to humans. It isn’t only Mecca, other sacred sites will be at risk too, like the religious sites in Jerusalem, the Golden Temple in India – it will affect what we hold dear to our hearts. We think that climate change is distant from us, but there is no area of life that it won’t touch.” If we are truly to tackle a catastrophe as huge as the climate crisis, we have to make it personal. Without a personal stake, it remains an abstract and we unite in perpetuating it. So if money is the only form of emotional investment for some, and if economics wields more power than the will to save our planet, we must use it. Next year Saudi Arabia is hosting the G20 summit, so let’s pressure the country to consider the financial threat due to a loss of religious tourism. Hajj is lucrative: economic experts have said revenues from hajj and umrah (a lesser pilgrimage undertaken any time of year) are set to exceed $150bn by 2022. “For the Saudis, hajj is more precious than oil,” says Dr Husna Ahmad, CEO of Global One, who’s been campaigning for a greener hajj for years. Ahmad created a green guide to hajj in 2011, and is now working on a green hajj app, which she plans to launch next year if funding is secured. With approximately 100m plastic bottles left behind each year after the pilgrimage ends, it’s clear that action is desperately needed. Slowly, Saudi authorities are beginning to implement a more environmentally friendly hajj by installing recycling points around the holy sites, and they aim to cut waste volumes by two-thirds by 2030. Pushing for change has been a struggle in the kingdom, but apathy is a wider problem. It’s bound up in socio-economic deprivation, and too often “saving the planet” is seen as something for the rich, a kind of green elitism. “Right now in the UK it feels like middle-class white women – and Sadiq Khan – are the only ones taking up the baton,” says Ahmad. “We know that climate change started with the European industrial revolution and poverty is inextricably linked to that. “People are trying to survive, you can’t blame them if climate change is not their priority. This is why achieving the UN sustainable development goals are high on my agenda.” The climate crisis does not exist in and cannot be tackled in isolation. While the big dogs must green-up their institutions and businesses, grassroots activists need better relations with governing bodies, more Muslims need to get involved with the broader debate and we all need to rethink our lifestyles – cut down on meat consumption, use less packaging and step back from throwaway consumerism. We all have a part to play – institutionally, socially, morally, economically and religiously. Whether it’s through the lens of our conscience, faith or finance, it’s imperative to find our own catalyst for action. If the threat to hajj can motivate Muslims, then that’s all for the good. • Remona Aly is a journalist and commentator"

By Dr. Andreas Mueller
(Summarized by P. Gosselin)
Last weekend the climate conference by the Germany-based European Institute for Climate and Energy EIKE took place in Munich, despite threats by leftist radicals.
More than a dozen leading international climate experts presented views that severely challenge mainstream alarmist climate science.
1. Alps glaciers smaller than today during much of the Holocene
Among the speakers was Prof. em. Christian Schlüchter is a leading Swiss geologist who studied the glaciers of the Alps in great detail for decades. In his talk he reported his findings from very old timber found in and below glaciers, and what those ancient tree remnants tell us about the glacial epochs of the Alps.

Image: EIKE
Schlüchter’s findings involve paleoclimatic records (timber, turfs, insects, etc.) found and dated using 14C as a standard method. The most important slide of his talk shows the last 12,000 years:

Image: EIKE
His findings show that for long periods of time in the last 12,000 years, temperatures were higher than in 2005.  Early on, from 10,000 to 8,800 BC, and again in the last few hundred years, temperatures were significantly lower.
The key message is that the alpine glacier extent was often smaller than in 2005. The timberline was at least 300 meters higher, which indicates a minimum of 1.8° C higher temperatures than today. An example of this is Hannibal, who managed to cross the Alps with elephants during the Roman times.
Schlüchter summarized that more than 50% of the last 11000 years alpine glaciers were smaller than 2005 and that events of glacier growth were fast and short. Also the little ice age (from the end of the medieval warm period to about 1850) was the longest glacier extension since the last ice age 12,000 years ago,
2. IPCC models have substantial shortcomings
Also speaking at the conference was Italian physicist and climate modeler Nicola Scafetta, a well-known critic of IPCC climate models. His talk in Munich again examined the substantial shortcomings of IPCC climate models:

Image: EIKE
Scafetta discussed several areas where the climate models constantly fail. A key case is the Medieval Warm Period, which he showed together with the Roman Warm Period and the Modern Warm Period:
On the following slide, Prof. Scafetta shows how the IPCC models (light blue line) fail to reproduce the Medieval Warm Period (red real data) in the left part of the chart:

Image: EIKE
According to Scafetta, the models the IPCC uses are not capable of reproducing climate variations, which follow periodic solar activity.
The following chart compares the IPCC 2013 models to that of his own model (yellow area):

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




Image: EIKE
Both are not perfect and so indeed contradict any claim that the “science is settled”. But Scafetta’s model appears to be much more on track than the IPCC models.
Scafetta concludes:

 
3. Nir Shaviv: CO2 climate sensitivity largely overestimated 
Renowned Israeli astrophysicist Nir Shaviv continued where Scafetta left off, presenting the IPCC world and its errors. Shaviv emphasized that the climate sensitivity of CO2 is unknown and largely overestimated by the IPCC:

Image: EIKE
The Israeli astrophysicist judged the IPCC leaving out the sun as a driver “a severe shortcoming”, saying that the IPCC overestimates climate sensitivity of CO2 at the expense of solar influences.
While IPCC modelers managed to hide this for 20th century data, it will lead to a serious overestimate of temperatures in the 21st when solar influences will be cooling, according to the the Israeli scientist. Shaviv therefore expects a much lower temperature rise than that predicted by the IPCC.
Shaviv summarized:

4. Sun, clouds have huge impact on climate, IPCC ignores
Danish physicist and climate researcher Henrik Svensmark talked how he found it more and more difficult to raise funding for his research because the results contradict the IPCC.
Svensmark investigated the mechanism of how cosmic rays impact the creation of climate-crucial clouds. This happens through creation of ions which serve as clouding seeds in the atmosphere:

Image: EIKE
By experiments and by correlation measurements, Svensmark investigated the mechanism of cloud creation by cosmic rays. IPCC researchers already cite a reduction of cloud creation as a possible positive feedback mechanism, which could escalate global warming to catastrophic levels, and so Svensmark’s research needs to be addressed seriously.
The importance of cloud creation as a cooling climate factor is regarded as undisputed, Svensmark’s conclusion:

Image: EIKE 
Scientific summary
Overall, as a physicist, I found the 4 ground-breaking scientists presented results that make it seem highly improbable that the IPCC climate models are complete and reliable. The IPCC models are hardly worthy of any 97% consensus.

Problems with the climate problem

Image source: BoD – Books on Demand
At the end of July Eike Roth published a book titled “Problems with the climate problem: A myth crumbles“.  The book’s description:
The climate is changing in a threatening manner. It has already become a degree warmer. It is man’s fault. Its CO2 releases endanger its existence. We have only a few years left to fundamentally change our behavior, otherwise the consequences will be catastrophic. Science agrees on this.
That is what we hear every day from every direction.
In this book precisely this is questioned in the this book. The situation, severity and breadth of the climate optimum, the climatic and non-climatic effects of CO2, the increase in extreme weather events, the strength and speed of anthropogenic climate change, the accuracy of climate models and their agreement with observed climate developments, the possibility or probability of other causes of observed climate change and the effectiveness, prospects of success and side effects of the initiated or required countermeasures are carefully examined.
The result shows that there is general agreement on the principles of the greenhouse effect and its anthropogenic intensification. However, it also identifies a whole series of points on which there is no consensus, at least not yet, and in some cases even serious dissent. For each of these points, it is explained in an understandable way what is specifically controversial and what significance this has for the climate problem as a whole.
All in all, the picture of the climate problem is very different from the one portrayed above. In view of the importance of the problem, it is necessary to clarify the outstanding issues as quickly as possible. Suggestions are made for further action.”
The book costs € 9,50 and can be ordered via BoD or Amazon.

"The world’s readiness for the inevitable effects of the climate crisis is “gravely insufficient”, according to a report from global leaders. This lack of preparedness will result in poverty, water shortages and levels of migration soaring, with an “irrefutable toll on human life”, the report warns.  Trillion-dollar investment is needed to avert “climate apartheid”, where the rich escape the effects and the poor do not, but this investment is far smaller than the eventual cost of doing nothing. The study says the greatest obstacle is not money but a lack of “political leadership that shakes people out of their collective slumber”. A “revolution” is needed in how the dangers of global heating are understood and planned for, and solutions are funded. Greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels, forest destruction and other human activities are trapping heat and putting more energy into the climate system.  Hotter air means heatwaves are much more likely. For example, scientists now say the unprecedented heat and wildfires across the northern hemisphere in 2018 “could not have occurred without human-induced climate change”. In Australia, the scorching summer of 2016-17 in New South Wales was made at least 50 times more likely by global heating, linking it directly to climate change. Hotter air can also carry more water vapour, meaning more intense rain and more flooding.  Another important factor in the northern hemisphere is the impact of changes in the Arctic. The polar region is heating more rapidly, reducing the temperature difference with lower latitudes. There is strong evidence that this is weakening the planetary waves (including the jet stream) that normally meander over Europe, Asia and North America. When these waves stall, weather gets fixed over regions and becomes extreme. This has been linked to past floods in Pakistan, heatwaves in Russia and drought in California.  Most of the planet’s trapped heat goes into the oceans and rising sea temperatures mean more energy for hurricanes and typhoons. Record-breaking cyclones hit Mozambique last year. The deluge delivered in the US by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 was made three times more likely by climate change. Rising sea level also means storms cause more coastal damage. Natural variability would cause some extreme weather, even without global heating, but our impacts on the climate make such extremes more likely. Carbon Brief analysed more than 230 studies and found 95% of heatwaves were made more likely or worse by climate change. For droughts, 65% were definitely affected by our hotter world, while the figure for floods was 57%. With the ‘rapidly accelerating’ likelihood of 40C temperatures in UK, it is now undeniable that global heating is causing more extreme weather. The report has been produced by the Global Commission on Adaptation (GCA), convened by 18 nations including the UK. It has contributions from the former UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon, the Microsoft founder, Bill Gates, environment ministers from China, India and Canada, the heads of the World Bank and the UN climate and environment divisions, and others. Among the most urgent actions recommended are early-warning systems of impending disasters, developing crops that can withstand droughts and restoring mangrove swamps to protect coastlines, while other measures include painting roofs of homes white to reduce heatwave temperatures. In the foreword to the report, Ban, Gates and Kristalina Georgieva, the World Bank chief executive, write: “The climate crisis is here, now: massive wildfires ravage fragile habitats, city taps run dry, droughts scorch the land and massive floods destroy people’s homes and livelihoods. So far the response has been gravely insufficient.” Ban said: “I am really concerned about the lack of vision of political leaders. They are much more interested in getting elected and re-elected, and climate issues are not in their priorities. We are seeing this in the US with President Trump.” The report says severe effects are now inevitable and estimates that unless precautions are taken, 100 million more people could be driven into poverty by 2030. It says the number of people short of water each year will jump by 1.4 billion to 5 billion, causing unprecedented competition for water, fuelling conflict and migration. On the coasts, rising sea levels and storms will drive hundreds of millions from their homes, with costs of $1tn (£810bn) a year by 2050. Patrick Verkooijen, the chief executive of the Global Center on Adaptation, said: “What we truly see is the risk of a climate apartheid, where the wealthy pay to escape and the rest are left to suffer. That is a very profound moral injustice.” But the moral imperative alone will not drive change, he said, and the report also makes an economic case. “It is a nation’s self-interest to invest in adaptation,” Verkooijen said. The report estimates spending $1.8tn by 2030 in five key areas could yield $7.1tn in net benefits, by avoiding damages and increasing economic growth. The chair of the UK’s Environment Agency, Emma Howard Boyd, is a member of the GCA. The agency has warned England could run short of water within 25 years and increased coastal and river flooding may force some towns to be abandoned. In July, the UK government’s official advisers said they were shocked at the lack of proper plans to protect people from the effects of the climate crisis. Bob Ward, the policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics, said: “As one of the governments that commissioned this important GCA report, the UK must heed its conclusions about the large economic benefits from adapting to those impacts of climate change that cannot now be avoided. “This summer has shown that the UK is not adapted to the changing climate of this century, with heavier rainfall and more frequent and intense heatwaves. Successive environment ministers have failed to give this issue the attention it needs, leading to greater damage to lives and livelihoods.” Cutting carbon emissions is vital, says the GCA report, but this has received nearly 20 times more funding than adaptation in recent years. Climate effects must be factored into decisions by those who make choices about the future, it says, such as business leaders. Verkooijen said nations should follow France in making it compulsory for large companies to report the climate risks to their businesses. The GCA report focuses on several areas of adaptation: Early warning systems: Just 24 hours’ warning of a coming storm or heatwave can cut the ensuing damage by 30%, saving lives and protecting assets worth at least 10 times the cost of the alert system. In Bangladesh, such systems, plus shelters and coastal protection, have already saved hundreds of thousands of lives since the Bhola cyclone in 1970 killed at least 300,000 people. Climate-ready infrastructure: Such measures can add 3% to the upfront costs but save $4 for every $1 spent. Flood protection is key and Shanghai, and other Chinese “sponge cities” are deploying porous pavements, rooftop gardens and trees in parks to soak up water from downpours. Relatively simple measures can also be effective, such as painting roofs with reflective white paint. In the Indian city of Ahmedabad, this has cut temperatures in the rooms below by 5C. Mangrove protection: These coastal forests buffer storms, protecting 18 million people and preventing $80bn a year in flood damage. They also provide nurseries for fish and tourist attractions worth billions. But construction, pollution and global heating have destroyed many mangrove forests, from Australia to Mexico. The GCA says the benefits of mangrove preservation and restoration are up to 10 times the cost."
"As Erica Roberts clung to a tall mango tree, the winds and sea water churned up by Hurricane Dorian pounding her face, a single thought ran through her head: “I will not die like this.” Her home, in the small town of High Rock on the eastern side of Grand Bahama, had been swept away. Her 24-year-old daughter Natori survived too, clinging to branches beside her. Roberts’ face and arms still bore dry, bloody cuts. The pair eventually lost their grip, she said, but they were swept close to a home that still stood. They got inside. “By the grace of God, we made it,” she said. “We are survivors.” The 41-year-old had not heard from seven close family members: two sons, a sister, two nephews, cousins, uncles. All were still missing. In a community of about 600, two were confirmed dead. At least 20 had not been heard from since Dorian spent two days destroying almost every building in sight. “We need aid,” Roberts said. “We have nothing. Everyone is doing this self-sufficiently.” The hurricane’s devastating 185mph winds brought destruction to Grand Bahama and the Abaco Islands and left at least 43 people dead – a toll that is sure to rise as emergency crews search for survivors. Parts of the road just outside town had been stripped of tarmac, leaving rubble, exposed pipework and pools of bronzed water where trapped fish still swam. Broken pylons dangled in the street. Palms were bent at 45 degrees, leaves shaved off by the wind. The storm surge here, about half a mile from the sea, rose to around 20ft. Wind gusts were recorded at 220mph. Many who have lived here for generations said the brutality of the storm was something they had never seen or even heard of before. For Roberts, who works at a nearby casino – also obliterated – the unprecedented intensity of Dorian, the way it strengthened so quickly to category 5 and stood over the island for more than 24 hours, had a simple explanation. “I think the climate is playing a big role in all of this,” she said, starring at the muddy tiled floor of a partially destroyed home in which she had taken shelter. “The severity of this … it’s global warming. “I’ve recycled all my life. I use less plastic. And think about less emissions. I’ve always been committed. But the world is not.” As residents of High Rock began to assess the damage, the global climate crisis was on the minds of many. Euridice Kemp, a 40-year-old resident of Freeport, had returned to help salvage what she could from her grandparents’ home. All that was left of the building were the concrete foundations. Belongings – crockery, family photos, clothes, wooden furniture – were strewn on the muddy grass. She pointed to the horizon where six coconut trees once stood, where she played as a child. “It’s all gone.

On Grand Abaco, the Royal Bahamas Defense force assisted around 160 evacuees to leave the island via ferry. The British navy is also assisting aid operations in the region and private vessels have begun to arrive as well. The Royal Caribbean cruise liner Symphony of the Seas arrived in Grand Bahama on Friday morning bringing with it 10,000 meals the company has provided itself. The food will be distributed by local NGOs and the Bahamian government. The United Nations has announced the purchase of eight tons in ready to eat meals and is aiming to provide other assistance including satellite communications and generators. The UN has said since Wednesday that around 70,000 people in the northern archipelagos of the Bahamas are in need of life-saving assistance."

Share this...FacebookTwitterA new study finds that 26 to 19 thousand years ago, with CO2 concentrations as low as 180 ppm, fire activity was an order of magnitude more prevalent than today near the southern tip of Africa – mostly because summer temperatures were 3-4°C warmer.
We usually assume the last glacial maximum – the peak of the last ice age – was signficantly colder than it is today.
But evidence has been uncovered that wild horses fed on exposed grass year-round in the Arctic, Alaska’s North Slope, about 20,000 to 17,000 years ago, when CO2 concentrations were at their lowest and yet “summer temperatures were higher here than they are today” (Kuzmina et al., 2019). Horses had a “substantial dietary volume” of dried grasses year-round, even in winter at this time, but the Arctic is presently “no place for horses” because there is too little for them to eat, and the food there is to eat is “deeply buried by snow” (Guthrie and Stoker, 1990).
In a new study (Kraaij et al., 2020) find evidence that “the number of days per annum with high or higher fire danger scores was almost an order of magnitude larger during the LGM [last glacial maximum, 19-26 ka BP]  than under contemporary conditions” near Africa’s southernmost tip, and that “daily maximum temperatures were 3-4°C higher than present in summer (and 2-4°C lower than present in winter), which would have contributed to the high severity of fire weather during LGM summers.”
Neither conclusion – that surface temperatures would be warmer or that fires would be more common – would seem to be consistent with the position that CO2 variations drive climate or heavily contribute to fire patterns.

"The Clark county death investigator Jill Roberts vividly recalls the sunny 115F (46C) afternoon last summer when she entered a Las Vegas home with no functional air conditioning. The indoor heat felt even worse than the broiling temperature outside. She climbed up the stairs, through thick, stifling air, landing in a third-story bedroom where the resident had died in sweltering conditions. The room had no fan and the door was shut. It felt as if it couldn’t get any hotter. “Our elements are unforgiving. Especially on those 115F days, it doesn’t take a lot,” Roberts told the Guardian. “In that situation I’ll go stand in the sun in the 115F heat to do my paperwork as opposed to staying in the house because it’s that hot.” The coroner’s office in Clark county, which encompasses Las Vegas, often records heat as a contributing factor to accidental deaths. There are hikers succumbing to lethal temperatures in the surrounding desert and heat-related deaths in cars and homes when occupants forgo cooling. Roberts has seen homeless people with post-mortem burns from collapsing on hot streets. And it will get worse. Las Vegas is the fastest-warming city in the United States, its temperatures having risen 5.76F since 1970. A June study of coroner data by the Las Vegas-based Desert Research Institute found a correlation between heatwaves and heat-related deaths in southern Nevada, both of which, they say, are on the rise. And a recent Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) report warns that without global action to reduce carbon emissions, the city will probably experience 96 days of heat above 100F by the end of the century, including 60 days over 105F, and seven “off the chart” days that would break the current heat index. Every city has its own challenges in adapting to climate change, even those that are supposedly accustomed to severe heat. In Las Vegas, a laissez-faire attitude toward growth has allowed high temperatures to become even more deadly, and the scorching heat now threatens the city’s basic functionality. Like the tourist guzzling alcohol by the resort pool, smiling and flirting until he faints from dehydration, southern Nevada has welcomed unfettered development since the 1930s – the advent of the home cooling era – when its population began to double in size nearly every decade despite limited water resources and increased drought. The resorts have long been the economic driver. Over a third of the area’s workforce is supported by the 40 million visitors a year who descend on their gargantuan hotel towers, bustling casinos and massive convention halls. And as tourism grows, so does the population. During the boom years before the 2008 housing crisis, hundreds of miles of desert landscape were paved over with heat-absorbing asphalt and concrete, worsening a “heat island” effect in the cauldron-like valley. Outward growth also led to vehicles motoring further across the sprawling metropolis, increasing heat-trapping carbon emissions. Now, with growth having continued each year since 2011, and new home developments returning to boom-era levels, Sin City is reckoning with a future that looks downright hellish. “The thing about Vegas is, we always do feast and famine,” said Tick Segerblom, a former state senator who now sits on the Clark county commission, which governs the Las Vegas Valley. “We never bother to say, ‘Where are we going? What are we doing?’” During summer months, when Las Vegas city buses break down notoriously often, many pedestrians carry umbrellas to protect their skin, and those without cover often “shadow walk”, following the shade of palm trees, signs and buildings to avoid direct exposure to a sunshine that can cause humans to overheat. The city’s poorest residents are most at risk. Fans and cooling systems can save lives, said Jill Roberts, the coroner office investigator, “but some people just don’t have the funds to fix their air conditioning or have working equipment”. Hundreds of homeless people living in the city choose to camp in storm drains rather than sleep above ground – another dystopian irony to the city’s reputation for glitz and glamor. Those who dislike the tunnels often have to work hard to stay cool. Marcy Averett, 49, and her husband spend 15 hours a day collecting recyclables. But each day before they set off, they buy ice. “I have to have cold water. I don’t know how people do it with hot water,” she told the Guardian on an August afternoon as she dragged a shopping cart filled with aluminum cans out of the blistering sun, into the shade of a highway overpass. An orange cooler hung from the side of her cart. Averett had a spray bottle to mist her face and neck, and applied lip balm as we spoke. “I put medicated moisturizer on my lips constantly, all day every day, and my lips are still cracked. It’s this heat.” Like many other rapidly warming cities across the United States, Vegas has only recently begun to reckon with its future. “The real question is, do we want a place where we just go from our houses to our cars to our offices, and never go outside because it’s too hot?” Segerblom, the former state senator, asked. “How many months of the year is that tenable?” Rachel Licker of the Union of Concerned Scientists warned that southern Nevada’s productivity and essential services will become increasingly stressed as temperatures rise – construction projects will slow or stop more frequently to ensure worker safety; police and postal workers may be affected; and since studies show schoolchildren perform worse as temperatures rise, teachers may need to adjust testing schedules and standards for days if not months at a time. Meanwhile, power surges may become more common if increased demand overwhelms electrical grids, leaving the people most sensitive to heat illness such as children and the elderly without a cooling system when it’s needed most. “Even though people in Las Vegas might be used to high levels of heat, it’s going to get even hotter, and we don’t know how much they’re going to be able to withstand,” Licker said. As Las Vegas Valley reaches its limits, many in the community believe now is an opportune time to contemplate the future of the city. “What do we want to be when we grow up?” said Segerblom. “Is there a way to manage this valley that’s good for the quality of life of the citizens of Nevada, not just for the tourists and hotels?” He noted that while state and federal policies get the most media attention, municipal governments can affect the environment just as well. Planting more native trees and shrubs, enforcing energy-efficient building standards, zoning to promote upward rather than outward growth, and developing alternatives to blacktop roads and concrete sidewalks are all policies that could have a major impact. To lessen its own carbon footprint, the city of Las Vegas began powering all government buildings and streetlights with renewable energy in 2016. The state’s largest energy consumers, the multi-thousand room hotels and casinos on the Strip, have also made environmental sustainability a priority in recent years. MGM Resorts has over 20 acres of solar panels atop the Mandalay Bay convention center, and much of the electricity flowing through properties like the Bellagio, Luxor and New York, New York comes from a solar array in the Mojave Desert. “We do feel it’s our responsibility to find innovative ways to use less energy and procure clean energy for our resorts,” said Mark Campbell, MGM Resorts’ executive director of sustainability. The company also donates unserved banquet food to a local food bank and uses smart thermostats to avoid cooling vacant rooms. For their part, Nevada voters passed a ballot initiative requiring state utilities to get 50% of their electricity from renewable sources by 2030. As a constitutional amendment, the proposal needs to pass a second time to take effect. But state lawmakers made that vote moot by adopting the standards on their own, on Earth Day 2019, through a legislative bill that received unanimous support. Nevada is rare state now in which reducing carbon emissions has become a bipartisan concern. In seeking more access to clean energy sources, the state hopes to get ahead of the dilemma posed by longer and more intensive air conditioning seasons that amount to more greenhouse gas emissions spewed into the air. “Heat is currently the top killer for weather-related hazards in the United States,” said Licker. “Those kinds of numbers would just get worse if we’re headed toward really significant climate change.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterA new paper appearing in the journal Earth Sciences here authored by Hermann Harde of the Helmut-Schmidt-University, Hamburg Germany, is stirring up more controversy among the climate science community, which generally claims humans have been responsible for rise in atmospheric CO2 concentrations since the mid 19th century.
The opposite is true
According to Harde, it is not the added CO2 that is causing the global temperature to rise, but just opposite: “The temperature itself dominantly controls the CO2 increase. Therefore, not CO2 but primarily native impacts are responsible for any observed climate changes.”
Harde claims this is backed up by and “in agreement with all observations.”
The paper is expected to generate much opposition in a science whose claimed consensus has increasingly come under fire.
What follows below is the paper’s abstract:
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assumes that the inclining atmospheric CO2 concentration over recent years was almost exclusively determined by anthropogenic emissions, and this increase is made responsible for the rising temperature over the Industrial Era. Due to the far reaching consequences of this assertion, in this contribution we critically scrutinize different carbon cycle models and compare them with observations. We further contrast them with an alternative concept, which also includes temperature dependent natural emission and absorption with an uptake rate scaling proportional with the CO2 concentration. We show that this approach is in agreement with all observations, and under this premise not really human activities are responsible for the observed CO2 increase and the expected temperature rise in the atmosphere, but just opposite the temperature itself dominantly controls the CO2 increase. Therefore, not CO2 but primarily native impacts are responsible for any observed climate changes.”
The study builds on a previous controversial paper published in 2017: Scrutinizing the carbon cycle and CO2 residence time in the atmosphere in the journal Global and Planetary Change.
Hermann Harde is not alone in backing the hypothesis that temperature drives CO2, and not the other way around. Other scientists in Harde’s camp include, among others, Dr. Murry Salby. formerly of the Macquarie University in Sydney.

In climate models, the Earth continues to be flat
By Kalte Sonne
(German text translated by P Gosselin)
Did you know that all climate models assume a flat earth? Hard to believe, but unfortunately true. A study by Michael Prather and Juno Hsu in PNAS explains that this simplification causes powerful distortions in computer simulations.:

A round Earth for climate models
Sunlight drives the Earth’s weather, climate, chemistry, and biosphere. Recent efforts to improve solar heating codes in climate models focused on more accurate treatment of the absorption spectrum or fractional clouds. A mostly forgotten assumption in climate models is that of a flat Earth atmosphere. Spherical atmospheres intercept 2.5 W⋅m−2 more sunlight and heat the climate by an additional 1.5 W⋅m−2 globally. Such a systematic shift, being comparable to the radiative forcing change from preindustrial to present, is likely to produce a discernible climate shift that would alter a model’s skill in simulating current climate. Regional heating errors, particularly at high latitudes, are several times larger. Unlike flat atmospheres, constituents in a spherical atmosphere, such as clouds and aerosols, alter the total amount of energy received by the Earth. To calculate the net cooling of aerosols in a spherical framework, one must count the increases in both incident and reflected sunlight, thus reducing the aerosol effect by 10 to 14% relative to using just the increase in reflected. Simple fixes to the current flat Earth climate models can correct much of this oversight, although some inconsistencies will remain.
Significance
Early climate and weather models, constrained by computing resources, made numerical approximations on modeling the real world. One process, the radiative transfer of sunlight through the atmosphere, has always been a costly component. As computational ability expanded, these models added resolution, processes, and numerical methods to reduce errors and become the Earth system models that we use today. While many of the original approximations have since been improved, one—that the Earth’s surface and atmosphere are locally flat—remains in current models. Correcting from flat to spherical atmospheres leads to regionally differential solar heating at rates comparable to the climate forcing by greenhouse gases and aerosols. In addition, spherical atmospheres change how we evaluate the aerosol direct radiative forcing.
The authors stress that the resulting errors are in the order of magnitude of the greenhouse gas forcing. Thus the solar irradiation and the aerosol forcing are falsified.
So in the future, when someone insults annoying climate critics again as “flat-world supporters”, the answer is basically clear: The real “flat earthers” are climate modelers who still simulate flat worlds due to their limited computer computing power, and who have not yet been able to simulate the real world…

"Queensland’s former fire commissioner says an erratic bushfire front that climbed into the state’s subtropical rainforest and razed the 86-year-old Binna Burra Lodge is “like nothing we’ve ever seen before”. “What we’re seeing, it’s just not within people’s imagination,” said Lee Johnson, who spent 12 years in charge of Queensland’s fire service. “They just didn’t believe it could ever get so bad.” Queensland remains in the grip of one of the worst bushfire threats in its history, fuelled by prolonged dry conditions and fierce gusting winds; an “omen” of a potentially devastating fire season ahead. There are still 52 fires burning across the state. Schools are closed and about 20 structures have been destroyed. Early on Sunday morning, a fire front climbed into the Lamington national park and razed Binna Burra, a historic eco-tourism lodge built in the 1930s and surrounded by subtropical Gondwana rainforest. The heritage-listed main lodge was built in 1933. It has never before been seriously threatened by bushfire, protected in part by lush and damp surroundings that typically suppress the progress of dangerous fires. “There have certainly been fires in the area before,” said the lodge chairman, Steve Noakes. “Back in the traditional owners’ time there’s evidence of fires, but certainly in the period of European history in this part of Australia, this is the most catastrophic. “There’s nothing left to burn at Binna Burra, it’s all gone.” Last year, Queensland experienced “unprecedented” fire conditions in November – a combination of hot, dry and windy days in tropical and subtropical parts of the state. A year later, and again conditions are being described in similar terms, the sort that can fuel catastrophic wildfires. Southeast Queensland has been particularly dry; the fire-threatened town of Stanthorpe is almost out of drinking water. In Lamington national park, the rainforest has had very little recent rain. Johnson, who is now a director of the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre, said in those sorts of extremely dry conditions the forest terrain became a potential tinderbox. “We’ve had a very long history of concern about that area, but we definitely have not seen fire conditions like this,” Johnston said. “Their terrain is very similar to parts of southern New South Wales and Victoria where bushfires are the norm. In Queensland the potential is there. That country at Lamington national park in particular, the topography is just cruel. “The weather conditions they’re now facing are just unheard of. The thing about fire, the bush in those conditions, is you can’t actually fight it. The heat generated means you can’t put people or equipment in front of this fires, you just can’t do it.” Part of the attraction of a place like Binna Burra Lodge is the isolation. There is one narrow access road. About 3am on Sunday morning, concern about the welfare of firefighters forced a retreat. All anyone could do was wait, while the fire front moved through. “We can’t access the site, it will be cut off for some days because of the rock slides and the tree fall,” Noakes said. “A couple of the emergency services workers hiked in yesterday, they were very brave, but it’s basically a write-off.” Noakes said the situation was “a signal to us that we need to take a more proactive approach to climate change”. “We need to know more about the impact of climate change on subtropical rainforests of Australia and what that means in terms of long-term infrastructure. That’s why people come to Queensland, to experience these places.” He said Binna Burra would be rebuilt in a way that took into account the likely impacts of climate change. “Binna Burra is 86 years old. When we position and design and build and operate tourism infrastructure in these sorts of natural environments, we have to think about 50 or 100 years ahead and what changes climate impacts are going to have on the built infrastructure. “Our responsibility now is to have a vision that is crafted of the knowledge and the understanding of the climate as it will impact on the tropical and subtropical rainforest.”"

"Arnold Schwarznegger has condemned Donald Trump over his unprecedented rollback of environmental protections, particularly his move against California’s regulation of automobile emissions.  “It’s wrong,” the Terminator star and two-term governor wrote in an opinion column for the Washington Post that was pointedly headlined: “Trump can’t erase a decade of clean-air progress with a Sharpie.” That was a reference to the furore over Trump’s display in the Oval Office last week of a hurricane map apparently altered with a Sharpie, or marker pen, to make a forecast for Hurricane Dorian show it potentially hitting Alabama. “It’s un-American,” Schwarzenegger said. “And it’s an affront to longstanding conservative principles.” Schwarzenegger said the Trump administration was “hellbent on reversing decades of history and progress”. “Whether it is [motivated by] political pettiness, shortsightedness or just plain jealousy, I couldn’t tell you,” he said. Describing his anger at moves against California over automobile emissions, Schwarzenegger said his state had been a leader in establishing clean-air standards since 1967, when his “hero”, Ronald Reagan, was governor. Schwarzenegger wrote: “We set our standards, and the federal government didn’t just respect our authority, it generally made our rules the standard for the entire nation.” The same pattern applied to efforts to curb greenhouse gases, he said. “The Trump administration’s threat to revoke our waiver to clean our air is more extreme,” Schwarzenegger wrote. “And coming from a Republican White House, it’s downright hypocritical.” The former governor also pointed to a contradiction between the conservative principle of states’ rights and the behaviour of the Trump administration. “How many times have you heard conservatives beat the drum of states’ rights?” he asked. “But suddenly, when a state wants to pollute less and protect its citizens from deadly pollution, conservatives throw states’ rights straight out the window.” California’s economic success, he said, was built on long-term planning. In contrast, the administration’s “knee-jerk reactionary policies such as the move to revoke our clean-air waiver create uncertainty”. “They didn’t ask for the Trump administration’s backward thinking, and they know it won’t help them,” he said of four big car companies that have worked with California on limiting emissions. He added: “California will fight this decision. And I promise you, we will win.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterAs reported in 4 separately-published papers, scientists have discovered a mechanism whereby islands can build themselves up naturally, thwarting the threat of sea level rise.  Tuck et al. (2019) affirm the “implications of island building are profound, as it will offset existing scenarios of dramatic increases in island flooding.”
Earlier this year, Duvat (2019) identified a global trend in island shoreline net growth despite recent sea level rise.
The welcome news is that none of the islands larger than 10 ha – and just 1.2% of the 334 islands larger than 5 ha – have decreased in size since the 1980s. Nearly 90% of the world’s islands have been stable to expanding in coastal area during recent decades.

In four other new papers, 3 of them with Auckland University Ph.D candidate Megan E. Tuck as lead author, scientists have discovered a mechanism whereby islands have the capacity to “morphodynamically respond to rising sea level” via wave-driven “overwash processes”.
The implications are profound. The most concerning impacts of sea level rise may effectively be thwarted by natural processes and consequently “many islands are less vulnerable to inundation than currently perceived.”
Positive developments in marine science like this are indeed worth reporting in 4 papers and 3 separate scholarly journals within the same calendar year.
This good news also deserves much more coverage than the public is likely to see.

1. Tuck et al., 2019
“Here, we present evidence from physical model experiments of a reef island that demonstrates islands have the capability to morphodynamically respond to rising sea level through island accretion. Challenging outputs from existing models based on the assumption that islands are geomorphologically inert, results demonstrate that islands not only move laterally on reef platforms, but overwash processes provide a mechanism to build and maintain the freeboard of islands above sea level. Implications of island building are profound, as it will offset existing scenarios of dramatic increases in island flooding. Future predictive models must include the morphodynamic behavior of islands to better resolve flood impacts and future island vulnerability.” 
2. Kench and Beetham, 2019
“Coral reef islands are unconsolidated deposits of reef-derived sand and gravel that are considered vulnerable to the impacts of global sea-level rise because of their low elevation (< 3 m) and exposure oceanic wave energy. Previous research has shown that sea-level rise will drive an increase in wave overtopping on reef island shorelines, which will be an increasing hazard for atoll island communities. Here, we show that wave overtopping on reef islands is a geomorphically important process that facilitates sediment deposition on the island surface and vertical building. Field evidence from 26 overwash deposits show that vertical island accretion can be driven by king tides, long-period swell, local storms, tropical cyclones and tsunami. Deposit depths ranged between 0.06–1.93 m and increased island elevations by between 4–400%. Recognition that overwash processes can contribute to vertical island building is instructive in considering the potential for islands to adjust to future increases in sea-level and to incorporate this critical morphodynamic response in future flood risk modelling for low islands.”
3. Tuck et al., 2019
“[R]esults show that the rate and magnitude of physical adjustment is strongly dependent on the rate and magnitude of sea-level rise and wave conditions. Results challenge existing models of future island susceptibility to wave driven flooding, demonstrating that washover processes can provide a mechanism to build and potentially maintain island freeboard above sea level. These insights highlight an urgent need to incorporate island morphodynamics into flood risk models in order to produce accurate assessments of future wave-driven flood risks and better resolve island vulnerability.”
4. Tuck et al., 2019
“Low-lying coral reef islands are considered extremely vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. However, future island morphodynamic adjustments in response to anticipated sea level rise and changing wave conditions are currently poorly resolved. Assertions of island vulnerability are based on outputs from flood risk models that simulate sea level rise on present day island topography despite evidence that many reef islands are highly dynamic landforms. Utilizing a physical modelling methodology, three experiment programs were undertaken to model gravel island morphodynamics in response to increasing sea level and changing wave conditions. Modelling outputs present new insights into the modes and styles of island change, primarily the first experimental evidence that reef islands can keep pace with sea level rise through island building driven by washover processes. Results suggest that many islands are less vulnerable to inundation than currently perceived and may endure on reef platforms despite sea level rise.”

“Surface melting on Antarctic Peninsula ice shelves can influence ice shelf mass balance, and consequently sea level rise. We show that summertime cloud phase on the Larsen C ice shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula strongly influences the amount of radiation received at the surface and can determine whether or not melting occurs.”

“Clouds are one of the most important factors determining the radiation budget. In other words, all surface solar irradiances (SSI), atmospheric absorptions (AA), and reflection irradiances (RI) at TOA can be different according to the presence of clouds in the atmosphere…. Clouds in all- (or overcast-) sky atmosphere diminish surface solar irradiances (SSI) from 218.1 Wm−2 to 156.9 Wm−2 (or 85.8 Wm−2) and enhance atmospheric absorptions (AA) from 61.5 Wm−2 to 86.3 Wm−2 (or 128.2 Wm−2). Clouds also enhance the reflected irradiances (RI) at the TOA from 65.6 Wm−2 to 102.0 Wm−2 (or 131.2 Wm−2) for all- (or overcast-) skies. As a result, the all- (or overcast-) sky shortwave (SW) cloud forcing (CF) is −61.2 Wm−2 (or −132.3 Wm−2) at the surface, AA is 24.8 Wm−2 (or 66.7 Wm−2) in the atmosphere and RI is 36.4 Wm−2 (or 65.6 Wm−2) at the TOA, respectively.”

“Cloud radiative effects (CREs) are known to play a central role in governing the long-term mean distribution of sea-surface temperatures (SSTs). Very recent work suggests that CREs may also play a role in governing the variability of SSTs in the context of the El Niño/Southern Oscillation.”
4. Pan et al., 2020
“Clouds crucially regulate atmospheric energy balance, water circulation, and Earth’s climate system with multiple spatiotemporal scales (Boucher et al. 2013). Fundamental conundrums on clouds, the coupling of clouds with atmospheric circulation, and climate interactions have remained unsolved and have been identified as considerable challenges in climate research (Bony et al. 2015). One of the largest uncertainties amongst these challenges is the vertical property of clouds and their radiative effects (Li et al. 2015). Vertical variation of clouds can affect the vertical distribution of atmospheric radiative heating, surface energy balance, and general circulation by changing the vertical structure of radiative warming and cooling rates (Johansson et al. 2015; Pan et al. 2017). Quantifying the vertical distribution of cloud radiative forcing and their impacts on atmospheric circulation and regional climate has become critical.”
5. Yin and Porporato, 2020
“Toward this goal, here we analyze the radiation at the top of the atmosphere and propose a measure of the DCC [diurnal cloud cycle] radiative effect (DCCRE) as the difference between the total radiative fluxes with the full cloud cycle and its uniformly distributed cloud counterpart. When applied to the frequency of cloud occurrence, DCCRE is linked to the covariance between DCC and cloud radiative effects. Satellite observations show that the daily cloud cycle is strongly linked to pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) and climate hiatus, revealing its potential role in controlling climate variability.”
6. Delgado-Bonal et al, 2020
“Our research supports the idea that clouds and albedo, which ultimately determine the SW radiation, are variables of the utmost importance for current climate change, in agreement with previous research about the changes in stratocumulus or energy imbalance in the last four decades for example. An increase in cloud coverage of 0.1 would, on average, lead to a 7% increase in spectrally integrated global average reflectance of shortwave radiation.”
“When reaching the Earth, part of the incoming solar radiation is reflected off clouds and the surface as shortwave radiation (SW). Changes in cloud distribution or the surface albedo affect this flux and change the energy balance. In the last four decades, changes in cloud distribution in low-level clouds such as subtropical stratocumulus have been of great importance since they have the ability to reflect large amounts of radiation back to space but do not reduce significantly the outgoing terrestrial radiation. … [S]hortwave radiation is the main driver in the dynamics and plays a major role in the energy balance by affecting the longwave radiation field.”
 “The existence of reflective surfaces such as clouds or the ground determines directly the amount of SW radiation and, thus, the available energy for being absorbed and reemitted as LW. … A plausible hypothesis to explain the changes in SW radiation is that cloud amount and properties have changed in the last decades.”

I. The insignificance of modern “global warming”
Today’s ocean temperatures average about 16°C. CO2 levels hover around 400 parts per million (0.04%).
The oceans have warmed at a rate of just 0.015°C per decade since 1971 in the 0-700 m layer according to the IPCC (2013). This warming rate isn’t detectable when considering overall long-term changes in this layer (Rosenthal et al., 2017) during the Holocene.

The global oceans have only warmed 0.09°C in the 0-2000 m layer since 1955 (Levitus et al., 2012). This less than one-tenth of a degree Celsius thermal change represents 93% of the modern “global warming” manifestation.

The oceans have warmed merely 0.021°C since 1994 (Wunsch, 2018), with a cooling trend in the abyssal waters.

In the near-surface layer of the ocean (0-20 m), temperatures rose more than 5 times faster from 1900 to 1945 (~1.2°C, 0.27°C/decade) than they did during 1945 to 2010 (~0.3°C, 0.046°C/decade), which is the opposite of what would be expected if CO2 emissions were driving thermal changes in the ocean (Gouretski et al., 2012).

II. The astounding warmth of the distant past – when marine species thrived
A year ago, Henkes et al. (2018) determined marine animals “thrived” in water temperatures that averaged 35-40°C in “widespread regions of the oceans,” which is more than 20°C warmer than today’s average ocean surface temperature (~16°C).
The authors note that today’s tropical temperatures (25-30°C) can be equated to the “icehouse” conditions of the Carboniferous.
Further, when marine animals thrived in waters >20°C warmer than today, this warmth was accompanied by CO2 levels “5-10x higher than present-day values” – about 2000 to 4000 ppm.

Image Source: Henkes et al., 2018
In a new paper published in Science, Voosen, 2019 uses the data compiled by Henkes et al. (2018) to further reiterate
“Some 450 million years ago, ocean waters averaged 35°C to 40°C, more than 20°C warmer than today. Yet marine life thrived, even diversified”
and to construct a graphical representation of global ocean temperatures from the Paleozoic onwards. Voosen affirms “marine life diversified in extreme heat” and “mammals evolved during a warm period.”

Image Source: Voosen, 2019
In sum, coupling the 1) insignificant thermal ocean changes during modern times and the 2) extreme warmth (and high CO2 levels) of the distant past would seem to support the contention that marine animals are not currently in any sort of obvious danger from either rapid warming or high CO2 levels.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Trump-bashing German mainstream media are already going into deep depression over the 2020 US election. An ARD public television commentary by Washington correspondent Sebastian Hesse admits things are looking really dire for the US Democrats, and is now even seeing “a landslide victory for Trump”.

German ARD news media somber over Trump’s 2020 election chances. Image ARD tagesthemen
Forget the media in US . They lack the bird’s eye view and are deep in denial with the situation being so bleak for the Democrats.
Seeing a “landslide victory”
But in Europe the news media are beginning to see it. A commentary by Washington ARD correspondent Sebastian Hesse at ARD public television – Germany’s version of the BBC – openly comments: “Trump’s re-election is likely,” adding: “If next week were elected, who would win the race? Forecast: a landslide victory for Donald Trump.”
Will take a miracle
While the Democrats and Republicans begin to rumble in the political kick boxing ring in the lead-up to next year’s 2020 Presidential election, the vastly Trump-hating European media are watching with a view from their seats in the bleachers. And they’re in disbelief at what they are seeing.
They see a Democrat party that’s already battered, bleeding – with eyes puffed shut  – tired and about to go down for the count. Their only hope is a Hail Mary, a miraculously lucky punch landing.
It wasn’t supposed to be that way. Two and half years ago the snotty German media were all predicting enfant terrible Donald Trump would be a one-term president, if even that. What happened?
“Trump has delivered”

According to the ARD’s Hesse: “Trump has delivered.” He “has mobilized the conservatives by appointing conservative judges and “especially on issues that are close to America’s traditionalists’ hearts: Abortion, immigration, possession of weapons. […] Only George Washington had brought more new judges.”
“Unprecedented consistency”
Trump has also fought for building the wall on the border, doing away with paralyzing environmental legislation and patriotism at every opportunity “with unprecedented consistency”, Hesse sniffs.
The ARD correspondent adds: “The non-partisan floating voters who have made their mark on Trump may find him alienating or even repulsive as a person. But they make their choice soberly according to the simple formula: Am I feeling better today than four years ago?”
“Jobs, jobs, jobs”
Hesse also concedes “the economy has been buzzing since Trump took office” and the US has seen “growth rates like nowhere else in Europe, the stock market boom and above all jobs, jobs, jobs.”… “For the time being, many Americans feel that they are doing well under Trump.”
Opponents “are all in trouble”
Hesse currently sees Trump’s most promising opponents “are all in trouble”:” Joe Biden, because the Ukraine affair is also going home with him. Elizabeth Warren, because her agenda is also too left for many democrats. And Bernie Sanders, who already suffered a heart attack in the pre-election campaign.”
Forget impeachment
But what about the impeachment? German leaders and media are hoping that perhaps the impeachment process will stzop Trump. Here Hesse notes soberly: “Well, there is not even an impeachment procedure yet. And if there is one, it will most likely fail because of the Republican majority in the Senate”.
Hesse summarizes: “The bottom line is that only three developments could bring down Trump: outrageous revelations in the wake of the impeachment investigation. A noticeable economic downturn. And the most improbable: a convincing challenger, to whom the hearts and votes will fly to. All three are not in sight. The man in the White House doesn’t need to think about packing his suitcase!”

Share this...FacebookTwitterDutch farmers are angry – so much so that hundreds of them have mobilized their tractors and are blocking highways and creating havoc across the Netherlands.
The German language agraraheute.de (Agriculture Today) reports here: “Farmers in the Netherlands are fed up always being the whipping boy of the nation.”
Shutting down modern agriculture
According to agrarheute journalist, Eva Eckinger, all this was triggered by “radical demands made by the leftist liberal D66 government party.” The party is demanding the elimination of half of the country’s livestock!
D66 parliamentarian Tjeerd de Groot said: “There’s no future for intensive animal farming in the Netherlands.”
With their tractors, the angry farmers have wreaked havoc on traffic throughout the Netherlands. According to Germany’s Spiegel, the protesting farmers in the Netherlands have “caused hundreds of kilometers of traffic jams.”
“They blocked the access roads to The Hague with tractors.”
Fox News here reported that the farmers clogged “700 miles of highway” during the protest over emissions rules.
Demanding farmers make extraordinary sacrifices
According to De Groot, nitrogen emissions by agriculture is causing great damage, and a large proportion of Dutch nitrogen emissions comes from intensive livestock farming and so need to be curbed quickly.

De Groot is calling on farmers farmers to practice “closed-loop farming”, where there is a significant reduction in the number of animals and that its implementation should start quickly.
Spreading discontent
Dutch agricultural associations reacted angrily to De Groot’s proposal and said “the agricultural sector had already done a lot to improve sustainability” and so “the sector deserves a compliment – not a halving.”
The Dutch protests come at the heels of the French yellow vest protests, which are aimed at the high fuel taxes imposed on French citizens and businesses, and are the latest, clear signals that citizens are not going to take draconian environmental regulation and harsh climate protection policies quietly.
Growing chasm between ecological and economic interests
The Dutch protests highlight the economic difficulty governments have when they try to pass eco-friendly laws and reducing emissions. Despite the dubious claims that the two can go hand in hand, it is not the case as recent protests are showing. Across Europe there is a rapidly growing chasm between economic interests and radical environmental aims.
“A lot at stake”
As the New York Times reports: “There is a lot at stake: According to the Dutch farmers’ organization, LTO, exports from the Netherlands’ nearly 54,000 farms and agriculture businesses were worth 90.3 billion euros ($98.3 billion) last year.”
That’s just one sector in a small European country. Imagine the things to come should major continentwide industries like petroleum, tourism and airlines, etc. be hit – or the German auto industry.
The radical environmentalists are keeping their social-economic powder kegs awfully dry.

Share this...FacebookTwitterUsing NASA’s MERRA-2 radiation data, scientists find shortwave radiation (SW) has been rising since the 1980s. The SW increase has been larger and faster than longwave radiation (LW) changes during this same timespan. Cloud variability has been the “main driver” of these trends.

Image Source: Delgado-Bonal et al, 2020
In a new Nature journal paper (Delgado-Bonal et al, 2020) published in Scientific Reports, scientists use radiation records from NASA to conclude shortwave (SW) changes are “mainly determined” by cloud modulation.
Clouds are “showing a declining trend” from 1984-2014. Fewer clouds means less SW radiation is reflected to space and more is absorbed by the Earth’s surface.
Figures 1 (SW) and 2 (LW) suggest post-1980 radiative forcing trend lines reach ~3.5 W/m² (rising from approximately 103.5 to 107 W/m²) and slightly less than 1 W/m² (approximately 237.5 to 238.3 W/m²) for SW and LW, respectively.

Image Source: Delgado-Bonal et al, 2020
Therefore, because (a) the SW radiation trend has been more pronounced than the LW radiation changes, and (b) the cloud variability is the main driver of SW radiation (that is of “great importance to recent climate change”), the recent positive energy imbalance – and warming – can mainly be attributed to cloud modulation.
The “argued” dominance of a human and/or LW (greenhouse effect) domination in recent climate change therefore becomes a question that is “still open”.

Delgado-Bonal et al, 2020
“When reaching the Earth, part of the incoming solar radiation is reflected off clouds and the surface as shortwave radiation (SW). Changes in cloud distribution or the surface albedo affect this flux and change the energy balance. In the last four decades, changes in cloud distribution in low-level clouds such as subtropical stratocumulus have been of great importance since they have the ability to reflect large amounts of radiation back to space but do not reduce significantly the outgoing terrestrial radiation.”
“[S]hortwave radiation is the main driver in the dynamics and plays a major role in the energy balance by affecting the longwave radiation field”
“[C]hanges in cloud fraction for example would be rapidly manifested in the shortwave field and would influence the longwave radiation field since the available energy for being absorbed would be different.”
“The existence of reflective surfaces such as clouds or the ground determines directly the amount of SW radiation and, thus, the available energy for being absorbed and reemitted as LW.”
“Our research supports the idea that clouds and albedo, which ultimately determine the SW radiation, are variables of the utmost importance for current climate change, in agreement with previous research about the changes in stratocumulus or energy imbalance in the last four decades for example. An increase in cloud coverage of 0.1 would, on average, lead to a 7% increase in spectrally integrated global average reflectance of shortwave radiation.”

"Farming can become climate neutral by 2040 without cutting beef production or converting substantial areas of farmland into forest, according to a plan published by the National Farmers’ Union. Instead, the NFU says three-quarters of the UK’s agricultural emissions can be offset by growing fuel for power stations and then capturing and burying the carbon dioxide, which could lead to energy plants becoming the nation’s biggest crop after wheat. Increasing the carbon stored in soils and using technology to reduce the emissions caused by cattle and fertiliser use are also needed, the NFU says. Agriculture causes about 10% of the UK’s climate-heating emissions; of these agricultural emissions 90% is methane from livestock and nitrous oxide from fields. The UK is committed to ending net emissions by 2050, but sectors such as farming and aviation are the biggest challenges. Minette Batters, the president of the NFU, said making the sector climate neutral would be tough but an ambitious plan was necessary or society would not forgive farmers. She said farmers understood better than most that climate change was the biggest challenge of our time. “We are seeing far more extreme weather events and we are impacted more than anyone else because our offices are outside,” she said. “Last year was a frightening year on our farm. Our spring barley died in front of us” because of a lack of water. A series of recent scientific studies have concluded that consumers in rich nations need to drastically cut red meat consumption in order to tackle the climate crisis and destruction of wildlife. But the NFU argues that UK beef production does not rely on high-intensity farming or turning forests into pasture, and is only 40% as emission-intensive as the global beef production average. “We don’t plan to make any cuts,” Batters said. “We think we can do it without changing levels of production.” People are increasingly choosing to eat less meat and Batters said: “Everybody’s diet is up to individuals to choose, but there are other parts of the world that are hungry for high-quality meat.” The NFU plan envisages half of farming’s emissions being offset by growing willow, miscanthus grass and other energy crops to use in bioenergy with carbon capture and storage power plants. The technology is only at the pilot stage but the scale required by the NFU plan is consistent with projections for 2050 from the Committee on Climate Change, the government’s official advisers. The NFU plans also call for a doubling of wind, solar and biomethane energy on farms. Storing more carbon in soils, peatlands, woodlands and hedgerows offsets another fifth of agricultural emissions. Only 1.5% of the total comes from new tree planting – less than the CCC has recommended – but the NFU sees its figure as the maximum realistically possible. A quarter of farming’s emissions can be cut by raising animals and growing crops more efficiently, according to the NFU. Its plans highlight feed additives to cut methane in animals, gene editing to improve crops and livestock, and controlled-release fertilisers. “It is very welcome that the NFU is setting ambitious targets,” said Sue Pritchard, the director of the RSA’s food, farming and countryside commission, which concluded in July that farming must be radically transformed within 10 years to end environmental destruction. “Many farmers are already doing what they can – the growth of the pasture fed livestock movement is a case in point.” The Friends of the Earth campaigner Guy Shrubsole said: “Eating less but better meat is a crucial part of the fight against climate breakdown, yet astonishingly there is no mention of this in the NFU’s report. Doing so would free up much more land for trees and agroforestry, which would absorb huge quantities of carbon from the atmosphere. “It seems the NFU is still not prepared to contemplate significant land use change in Britain, despite the CCC recommending this as being vital,” he said, noting that some progressive farmers are starting to pioneer a new approach to managing the land. Some environmental groups have called for a quarter of the UK to be returned to nature through rewilding to tackle the climate crisis and the loss of wildlife. Batters said: “All farms have wild areas on them. It shouldn’t be a binary debate of rewilding versus production.” Farmers are extremely worried about a possible no-deal Brexit and the UK being flooded with cheap, lower-standard food, and Batters said achieving climate neutrality would be extremely hard in that scenario. The NFU report does not assess whether payments to farms – currently £3bn a year under the EU subsidy regime – would need to rise or fall in order to make agriculture climate neutral. Batters said it was vital for the government to introduce the right policies so farmers were given incentives to deal with emissions, and have long-term funding in place."
"Last fall, as I landed in New Orleans, a seed of existential anxiety lodged itself deep in my gut. It was my fifth flight in just over a week. I was in the middle of a tour to promote a book on how coastal communities around the US were already responding to the climate crisis in surprising, often radical ways. Outside, the bayou shimmered below, the city itself barely distinguishable from the water that surrounds it. I could see the landscape that my air travel would play a role in diminishing – the additional CO2 in the atmosphere melting Arctic sea ice and Antarctic glaciers, causing sea levels to rise. What am I doing here? I wondered.  I posted an anxious tweet, asking if anyone had any bright ideas about what to do when your work – expanding the public conversation around the climate crisis – requires that you consume fossil fuels at a rate at odds with your values. I received a host of responses – fly less for vacations, purchase carbon offsets, use Skype instead. All of the options, save for one, focused on things I could do at an individual level, many of which I already did. It seemed to me the suggestions sought to assuage my personal feelings of shame and so fell short of whatever intelligence I was hoping the gaping maw of the internet might offer up. Since 2010, I have been researching and writing about sea-level rise. During that time the predictions for just how high the water might reach by 2100 have, in many places, more than doubled. Meanwhile, from 2010 to 2017 nearly  500,000 Americans filed flood insurance claims, and hundreds of thousands more experienced flooding first-hand. When you compare the claims filed during, say, the eight years of Reagan’s presidency to those mentioned above the numbers more than double. Which is to say for many living in low-lying areas the climate crisis is already here. One of the things I remember most clearly from my early research trips to rural flood-prone communities is that residents told me how alone they felt. Most knew of no other place whose suffering was somehow analogous to their own, or other people they might consult to learn how to tackle their flooding problem. Sometimes people tried to safeguard their homes themselves, building retaining walls out of brick, sandbags and stone. As Harvey bore down on Houston, Kristin Massey attempted to wrap her ranch in heavy-duty plastic sheeting after shelling out $130,000 to repair it in the wake of the floods that swamped the city the two years prior. But despite Massey’s efforts, her home still filled with water, displacing her family for the third time in three years. She would learn what many already knew: that overwhelmingly these individual fixes fail. As I have watched the US inundated, again and again, by record-breaking storms, another equally powerful phenomenon has begun to unfold. Across the country, community-led flood-survivor groups are popping up. There’s Residents Against Flooding in Houston, and Groundswell in Charleston, the Just Florence Recovery Coalition and Horry County Rising. Many begin online, in advance of a storm, and serve as information-sharing networks around where to get sandbags, the location of local shelters, and the latest weather predictions. Once the flood waters recede, the focus shifts to the process of recovery, covering everything from how to file a flood claim to which contractors are least likely to rip you off. But when one flood turns into two, then three or four or five, residents’ focus often shifts from how to weather individual storms towards identifying causes and advocating for community-wide solutions. The scale of concern shifts from the singular to the systemic. This summer, Higher Ground, the largest coalition of flood survivors in the country, started a nationwide campaign of their own. In addition to empowering frontline communities by connecting them to pro-bono legal and scientific counsel, the group began disrupting city council meetings by unfurling banners that read: The United Flooded States of America. Member groups have filed lawsuits against unlawful wetland development and the unjust use of flood pumps during storm events. They have started local taskforces to inform people of the underlying infrastructure problems that exacerbate flooding, what resources to demand elected officials provide, and the role that climate change has played in amplifying their pre-existing vulnerability. Some have filed for temporary injunctions against floodplain development, while others even advocated for managed retreat, the only mitigation strategy that moves residents permanently away from risk. Allison Sedatol Reviere, whose home in Lafayette, Louisiana flooded for the fifth time in five years during Hurricane Barry, recently joined forces with Higher Ground. “No one, no one would buy my home. I have five flood claims since 2014. I felt trapped. But through this flood survivor network I found out that I was not alone, and that there was help available, that a buyout of my home was possible.” As Barry spun in the Gulf, Sedatol Reviere went through the motions of elevating her furniture and evacuating, but this time with the knowledge that this flood would likely be her last. At the end of my presentation last year in in New Orleans, an audience member asked me whether I still have hope? The hope that I do have does not revolve around individual choices (often framed through the lens of consumption). The hope that I do have is not about buying LED lightbulbs and electric cars; it’s not about eating vegan or bringing a canvas bag to the supermarket. These things can signal a shift in consumer habits (and those signals are extremely important), but they also frame the climate crisis as something that ought to be combated at the individual level, which, as Mary Annaïse Heglar of the Natural Resource Defense Council recently pointed out, leads those who cannot afford such decisions to feel paralyzed while simultaneously letting the fossil fuel industry off the hook. The hope I do have resides in the fact that as the climate crisis comes home to us in deeply unsettling ways – in the form of heatwaves and freak storms, wildfires, and permafrost melt, twisting the world we know into new and disturbing shapes – it is also building unlikely coalitions amongst people who might not appear to share affinities at first glance. Since 2017, the US has endured the single costliest hurricane season in its history, meanwhile Higher Ground’s membership has ballooned to over 50,000 people. With a rise in risk has also come an awareness that our vulnerability to those risks is shared, if unevenly distributed. A recent study suggests that as many as 41 million Americans live in a home at risk to flooding – roughly 13% of the population. From this place it is much easier to identify the root of the problem: that unjust development and the fossil fuel industry have made our communities less safe while super-charging the storms to come. Elizabeth Sawin, the director of Climate Interactive, recently recommended that we begin to shift our focus away from what we alone cannot accomplish, away from our profoundly individualist society, and towards the kind of thinking that helps us to glimpse what is possible when people come together to demand change. Her words helped me to connect what I had seen: that the only personal action that can slow the tide of the climate crisis is to create a coalition bigger and more powerful than the individuals of which it is comprised. All around the globe members of various environmental groups – enter the Extinction Rebellion, 350.org, Fridays for the Future and the Sunrise Movement – are already making good on Sawin’s suggestion. A week after returning home, I attended a Nationalize Grid meeting in Rhode Island. As I glimpsed all the other people that were organizing to influence how energy is derived and distributed in that state, at last I felt some of my climate anxiety dissipate. It isn’t my first round of environmental activism, nor my last, but it is the first time that I recognize these actions as their own kind of carbon offset. But better. Because instead of marrying guilt to redemption, they strive to make cheap fossil fuels a thing of the past. Elizabeth Rush is the author of Rising: Dispatches from the New American Shore, a finalist for the Pulitzer prize in general nonfiction • This article was amended on 30 August and 2 September 2019 to correct the spelling of Elizabeth Sawin’s surname, and because an earlier version misnamed the Natural Resource Defense Council as the National Resource Defense Council. This has been corrected."

Share this...FacebookTwitterA newly released paper by Kumar et al looks at the changes and prediction of the Amery Ice Shelf (AIS) of East Antarctica using remote sensing data.
The scientists found that the ice shelf is prograding (expanding), and not breaking apart like some alarmist scientists feared earlier.

Hat-tip: Mary Brown
Wikipedia tells that in December 2006, “enormous cracks” had been forming for over a decade at a rate of three to five metres a day – possibly due to global warming – but researchers later said it was too early to attribute the phenomenon to global warming because of the “possibility of a natural 50-60 year cycle being responsible”.
Now the recent paper by Kumar et al reports findings that the Amery Ice Shelf (AIS) is not disintegrating, let alone shrinking, but rather is advancing!

“Prograding considerably”
Once readers get past the scientific gobbledygook of the paper’s abstract, (possibly intended to obscure the paper’s inconvenient results) it becomes clear the ice shelf there is growing. “Amery Ice Shelf extent is prograding considerably in the last two decades.”
The scientists reconstructed the past and made a prediction of the future-ice shelf extent using linear regression techniques. They found that changes in the ice shelf extent “are linked with ocean-atmosphere interaction”. That means natural factors are dominantly at work, and not the anthropogenic ones.
The AIS changes were studied using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) satellite data of the austral summer months (January–March) from 2001–2016. Using statistical techniques, the rate changes of the AIS extent were estimated.
14.5 km increase
According to the paper’s abstract: “The study reveals that the AIS extent has been prograded at the rate of 994 m/year with an average 14.5 km increase in the areal extents during 2001–2016, as compared to the year 2001, whereas, the maximum advancement in ice shelf extent was recorded during the 2006–2016 period.”
The study also found that the eastern part of Mackenzie Bay to Ingrid Christensen coast also “recorded advancement in ice shelf extents and mass” and that this was in part linked to “a decrease in the temperatures (air temperature and sea surface temperature).

"A mayor in the French alps has urged Emmanuel Macron to take action against “wackos” climbing Mont Blanc, after incidents including a British tourist abandoning a rowing machine on western Europe’s highest peak.  Jean-Marc Peillex, mayor of Saint-Gervais, who for years has sounded the alarm against overcrowding on Mont Blanc, said a member of the British “Royal Commandos”, thought to mean the Royal Marines, hauled up the exercise machine for a stunt on Saturday.  But he did not have the strength to bring it back down and left it in an emergency hut situated at 4,362 metres (14,300 feet). The man gave his name as Disney, said Peillex in an open letter published on Sunday, adding “with a name like that, you’d think he thought he was at an amusement park”. Also over the weekend, he said, a German tourist made the ascent with his dog, despite warnings not to do so from police brigades who patrol Mont Blanc during the busy summer season. He had promised he would leave his dog at a refuge before attempting the summit, said Peillex. Instead, he left in the middle of the night for the summit with the dog, which survived but returned with bloodied paws, according to photos posted on Peillex’s Twitter account. The incidents over the weekend came after two Swiss climbers landed a small plane east of Mont Blanc’s summit in June and started hiking to the top. Intercepted by mountain police, they were handed a fine of €38 and allowed to fly off, since technically they had only broken 1960s’ laws designating landing sites in the area. “This situation has gone on long enough,” Peillex said. He called on Macron to “write and pass laws without delay that from 2020 would severely punish all these wackos who break the law, and restore peace to Mont Blanc”. Officials are struggling to cope with a huge influx of climbers hoping to scale the 4,810-metre (15,774ft) peak, heightening the security risks as well as environmental impact. Warmer temperatures in recent years have melted the permafrost, raising the risk of rock falls on the most popular routes. Retreating glaciers, which are melting under the effect of global heating, are also leaving the granite slopes more vulnerable and prone to erosion. In May, officials banned climbers from scaling Mont Blanc unless they had booked a room in one of the three official shelters. The Alpine peak attracts nearly 25,000 climbers every year, but the daily crowds have led to flaring tempers among teams jockeying for position, and rampant illegal camping. So far this season, at least three climbers have died on Mont Blanc."

Share this...FacebookTwitterClaims of an escalating climate crisis are getting ever shriller in Europe and calls  for “real and radical action” are becoming increasingly urgent.
Leaders are now labelling their own citizens “ecological vandals”, and openly demanding they be brought under tight control by a China-modelled system. The building blocks for a tyranny are in place. 
Lately the thinly veiled calls for watering down western democracy have been becoming increasingly clear and unmistakable.
All the cornerstones for a green tyranny are emerging in Europe: 1) a claimed climate crisis that is 2) attributable to reckless human behavior, 3) it is urgent and 4) thus justifies strict regulation of human behavior, and all accompanied by 5) actions to silence dissident views.
Consumers criminalized, being labelled “ecological vandals”
Blaming humans for the ” climate crisis” is already well underway across Europe.
Recently the online Die Welt reported on a DPA interview of Green Party mastermind Nico Paech, who in the interview called for “a radical change in the behavior of citizens.”
Economist Paech, a proponent of a “post-growth economy which calls for a move away from consumerism and further economic growth, told the DPA that a majority society “believes it is climate competent, but lives like ecological vandals.” In other words, free citizens are to be viewed as criminals.
What is needed, said Paech, was a “radical reorientation” in order to “drastically reduce the emission of greenhouse gases quickly” and that it was necessary to “clear out our lifestyles”. What is needed is an authoritarian government to take swift and harsh control, he suggests. 
German leader: China-like dictatorship “more efficient”
Meanwhile German Green Party leader Robert Habeck last year in an interview with Phoenix German public television told viewers that if a democracy is unable to keep pace with the pressing challenges, then “a centralized system, which is naturally faster” needs to be seriously considered.

Habeck cites China as an example on how to get things done when citizens get in the way. In China:

There is no opposition or participation by citizens. And if they make mistakes, they still cannot be elected out of office. Maybe there will be a revolt in China, but first of all the system is more efficient. Do we want that or not? The decision cannot be made economically. It can be made only based on values and, yes, I would say that’s what we want.”
EU declares climate state of emergency
And to lay the groundwork for implementing such radical authoritarian initiatives, it comes as no surprise that the EU just recently declared “a climate emergency” after a vote of 429 MEPs in favour and 225 against. “Europe became the first continent to make this declaration,” Euronews.com reported.
Note s state of emergency is defined as follows:
A situation in which a government is empowered to perform actions or impose policies that it would normally not be permitted to undertake. A government can declare such a state during a disaster, civil unrest, or armed conflict. Such declarations alert citizens to change their normal behavior and orders government agencies to implement emergency plans.”
So, there’s really not much left to keep the EU from grabbing a lot more power, except ardent protests. But here, too, EU leaders are at work.
Free speech has its limits
Listen to German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s speech on freedom of expression, where she says ” freedom of speech has its limits” and that “we have to take away your freedom of speech, or else society won’t be free.”
Surely everyone is against hate speech. But deciding what qualifies as hate speech should not be left to governments – especially those obsessed with a climate doomsday to the point that they now label climate science skeptics as “deniers” and hinder them from expressing dissent and participating in public debate.
Moreover, Big Social Media like Twitter, Google and Facebook are also busily working behind the scenes obstructing dissenters from getting their views out over a variety of issues. And they are under increasing pressure to clamp down even harder.
So the building blocks of a green tyranny are already in place in Europe: crisis, urgency, culprit, proposed system, suppression of speech.
Opportunity knocks
Right now, the EU is just waiting patiently for that one opportune moment. We are possibly witnessing a watershed historical event in the making.

Share this...FacebookTwitterFor the perceived destruction of the planet, angry teenage activist Greta Thunberg puts the blame on economic growth and capitalism. Yet she doesn’t talk much about any alternative system that could provide for our needs.
The question arises: Is it even possible for human society to progress without economic growth?
An ecological Chinese-style global economy
One chief editor at German WDR public television thinks it is possible: People will just have to get used to austerity.
In an interview, Ulrich Ueckerseifer told the WDR that it would be possible for a global economy to function without growth “in the form of a managed market economy, for example. In a nutshell: a bit like China, but ecologically”.
Ueckerseifer said to do this there would have to be very strong targets and limits and that “no more environmental pollution would be allowed to be produced”.

The WDR chief business editor said this would require “a high level of willingness on the part of the population to do without.”
Dictatorship “the most socially just”
A growing number of activists and political leaders are seeing growth and sustainability as being incompatible, and many are calling for a system of rigid regulation. For example, German Green Party leader Annalena Baerbock sees regulatory measures as a central element for better climate protection.
According to German weekly FOCUS here: “Yes, for me regulatory law is the central element, because it is also the most socially just. This is also the instrument in environmental policy that has always helped us,” Baerbock told Deutschlandfunk radio.
How nice. All our climate “problems” can be solved – with just a little bit of dictatorship!
Already again authoritarian ideas and dreams are in vogue in the German political discourse.

Sun follows planets’ rhythm
New study corroborates the influence of planetary tidal forces on solar activity

One of the big questions in solar physics is why the Sun’s activity follows a regular cycle of 11 years. Researchers from the Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR), an independent German research institute, now present new findings, indicating that the tidal forces of Venus, Earth and Jupiter influence the solar magnetic field, thus governing the solar cycle. The team of researchers present their findings in the journal Solar Physics (doi: 10.1007/s11207-019-1447-1).
In principle, it is not unusual for the magnetic activity of a star like the Sun to undergo cyclic oscillation. And yet past models have been unable to adequately explain the very regular cycle of the sun. The HZDR research team has now succeeded in demonstrating that the planetary tidal forces on the Sun act like an outer clock, and are the decisive factor behind its steady rhythm. To accomplish this result, the scientists systematically compared historical observations of solar activity from the last thousand years with planetary constellations, statistically proving that the two phenomena are linked. “There is an astonishingly high level of concordance: what we see is complete parallelism with the planets over the course of 90 cycles,” enthused Frank Stefani, lead author of the study. “Everything points to a clocked process.”
As with the gravitational pull of the Moon causing tides on Earth, planets are able to displace the hot plasma on the Sun’s surface. Tidal forces are strongest when there is maximum Venus-Earth-Jupiter alignment; a constellation that occurs every 11.07 years. But the effect is too weak to significantly perturb the flow in the solar interior, which is why the temporal coincidence was long neglected. However, the HZDR researchers then found evidence of a potential indirect mechanism that may be able to influence the solar magnetic field via tidal forces: oscillations in the Tayler instability, a physical effect that, from a certain current, can change the behavior of a conductive liquid or of a plasma. Building on this concept, the scientists developed their first model in 2016; they have since advanced this model in their new study to present a more realistic scenario.
Small trigger with a major impact: tides utilize instability

In the hot plasma of the Sun, the Tayler instability perturbs the flux and the magnetic field, itself reacting very sensitively to tiny forces. A small thrust of energy is enough for the perturbations to oscillate between right-handed and left-handed helicity (the projection of the spin onto the direction of momentum). The momentum required for this may be induced by planetary tidal forces every eleven years – ultimately also setting the rhythm at which the magnetic field reverses the polarity of the Sun.
“When I first read about ideas linking the solar dynamo to planets, I was very skeptical,” Stefani recalled. “But when we discovered the current-driven Tayler instability undergoing helicity oscillations in our computer simulations, I asked myself: What would happen if the plasma was impacted on by a small, tidal-like perturbation? The result was phenomenal. The oscillation was really excited and became synchronized with the timing of the external perturbation.”
Solar dynamo with an added touch
In the standard scenario of a dynamo, the rotation of the Sun and the complex motion of the solar plasma create a cyclically changing magnetic field. Two effects interact here: the plasma rotates more quickly at the Sun’s equator than at the poles. This leads to the omega effect: the magnetic field lines frozen in the plasma stretch around the Sun and convert the magnetic field into a field aligned almost parallel to the Sun’s equator. The alpha effect describes a mechanism that twists magnetic field lines, forcing the magnetic field back into a north-south direction.
What exactly causes the alpha effect, however, is a subject of dispute. Stefani’s model indicates that the Tayler instability is partly responsible for this. The researchers consider the most plausible scenario to be one in which a classic solar dynamo is combined with the modulations excited by the planets. “Then the Sun would be a completely ordinary, older star whose dynamo cycle, however, is synchronized by the tides,” summarized Stefani. “The great thing about our new model is that we are now easily able to explain effects that were previously difficult to model, such as ‘false’ helicities, as observed with sunspots, or the well-known double peak in the Sun’s activity curve.”
Besides influencing the 11-year cycle, planetary tidal forces may also have other effects on the Sun. For example, it is also conceivable that they change the stratification of the plasma in the transition region between the interior radiative zone and the outer convection zone of the Sun (the tachocline) in such a way that the magnetic flux can be conducted more easily. Under those conditions, the magnitude of activity cycles could also be changed, as was once the case with the Maunder Minimum, when there was a strong decline in solar activity for a longer phase.
In the long term, a more precise model of the solar dynamo would help scientists to quantify climate-relevant processes such as space weather more effectively, and perhaps even to improve climate predictions one day. The new model calculations also mean that, besides tidal forces, potentially other, hitherto neglected mechanisms would have to be integrated into the solar dynamo theory, mechanisms with weak forces that can nevertheless – as researchers now know – have a major impact. To be able to investigate this fundamental question in the laboratory, too, the researchers are currently setting up a new liquid metal experiment at HZDR.

PETITION ON GLOBAL ANTHROPGENIC HEATING (Anthropogenic Global Warming, human-caused global warming)
The undersigned, citizens and scientists, send a warm invitation to political leaders to adopt environmental protection policies consistent with scientific knowledge.
In particular, it is urgent to combat pollution where it occurs, according to the indications of the best science. In this regard, the delay with which the wealth of knowledge made available by the world of research is used to reduce the anthropogenic pollutant emissions widely present in both continental and marine environmental systems is deplorable.
But we must be aware that CARBON DIOXIDE IS ITSELF NOT A POLLUTANT. On the contrary, it is indispensable for life on our planet.
In recent decades, a thesis has spread that the heating of the Earth’s surface of around 0.9°C observed from 1850 onwards would be anomalous and caused exclusively by human activities, in particular by the emission of CO2 from the use of fossil fuels in the atmosphere.
This is the thesis of anthropogenic global warming [Anthropogenic Global Warming] promoted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) of the United Nations, whose consequences would be environmental changes so serious as to fear enormous damage in an imminent future, unless drastic and costly mitigation measures are immediately adopted.
In this regard, many nations of the world have joined programs to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and are pressured by a intense propaganda to adopt increasingly burdensome programs whose implementation involves heavy burdens on the economies of the individual member states and depend on climate control and, therefore, the “rescue” of the planet.
However, the anthropogenic origin of global warming IS AN UNPROVEN HYPOTHESIS, deduced only from some climate models, that is complex computer programs, called General Circulation Models .
On the contrary, the scientific literature has increasingly highlighted the existence of a natural climatic variability that the models are not able to reproduce.
This natural variability explains a substantial part of global warming observed since 1850.
The anthropogenic responsibility for climate change observed in the last century is therefore UNJUSTIFIABLY EXAGGERATED and catastrophic predictions ARE NOT REALISTIC.
The climate is the most complex system on our planet, so it needs to be addressed with methods that are adequate and consistent with its level of complexity.
Climate simulation models do not reproduce the observed natural variability of the climate and, in particular, do not reconstruct the warm periods of the last 10,000 years. These were repeated about every thousand years and include the well-known Medieval Warm Period , the Hot Roman Period, and generally warm periods during the Optimal Holocene period.
These PERIODS OF THE PAST HAVE ALSO BEEN WARMER THAN THE PRESENT PERIOD, despite the CO2 concentration being lower than the current, while they are related to the millennial cycles of solar activity. These effects are not reproduced by the models.
It should be remembered that the heating observed since 1900 has actually started in the 1700s, i.e. at the minimum of the Little Ice Age , the coldest period of the last 10,000 years (corresponding to the millennial minimum of solar activity that astrophysicists call Maunder Minimal Solar ). Since then, solar activity, following its millennial cycle, has increased by heating the earth’s surface.
Furthermore, the models fail to reproduce the known climatic oscillations of about 60 years.

These were responsible, for example, for a warming period (1850-1880) followed by a cooling period (1880-1910), a heating (1910-40), a cooling (1940-70) and a a new warming period (1970-2000) similar to that observed 60 years earlier.
The following years (2000-2019) saw the increase not predicted by the models of about 0.2 ° C  [two one-hundredths of a degree]per decade, but a substantial climatic stability that was sporadically interrupted by the rapid natural oscillations of the equatorial Pacific ocean, known as the El Nino Southern Oscillations , like the one that led to temporary warming between 2015 and 2016.
The media also claim that extreme events, such as hurricanes and cyclones, have increased alarmingly. Conversely, these events, like many climate systems, have been modulated since the aforementioned 60-year cycle.
For example, if we consider the official data from 1880 on tropical Atlantic cyclones that hit North America, they appear to have a strong 60-year oscillation, correlated with the Atlantic Ocean’s thermal oscillation called Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation .
The peaks observed per decade are compatible with each other in the years 1880-90, 1940-50 and 1995-2005. From 2005 to 2015 the number of cyclones decreased precisely following the aforementioned cycle. Thus, in the period 1880-2015, between number of cyclones (which oscillates) and CO2 (which increases monotonically) there is no correlation.
The climate system is not yet sufficiently understood. Although it is true that CO2 is a greenhouse gas, according to the IPCC itself the climate sensitivity to its increase in the atmosphere is still extremely uncertain.
It is estimated that a doubling of the concentration of atmospheric CO2, from around 300 ppm pre-industrial to 600 ppm, can raise the average temperature of the planet from a minimum of 1° C to a maximum of 5° C.
This uncertainty is enormous.
In any case, many recent studies based on experimental data estimate that the climate sensitivity to CO2 is CONSIDERABLY LOWER than that estimated by the IPCC models.
Then, it is scientifically unrealistic to attribute to humans the responsibility for warming observed from the past century to today. The advanced alarmist forecasts, therefore, are not credible, since they are based on models whose results contradict the experimental data.
All the evidence suggests that these MODELS OVERESTIMATE the anthropogenic contribution and underestimate the natural climatic variability, especially that induced by the sun, the moon, and ocean oscillations.
Finally, the media release the message according to which, with regard to the human cause
of current climate change, there would be an almost unanimous consensus among scientists that the scientific debate would be closed.
However, first of all we must be aware that the scientific method dictates that the facts, and not the number of adherents, make a conjecture a consolidated scientific theory .
In any case, the same alleged consensus DOES NOT EXIST. In fact, there is a remarkable variability of opinions among specialists – climatologists, meteorologists, geologists, geophysicists, astrophysicists – many of whom recognize an important natural contribution to global warming observed from the pre-industrial period and even from the post-war period to today.
There have also been petitions signed by thousands of scientists who have expressed dissent with the conjecture of anthropogenic global warming.
These include the one promoted in 2007 by the physicist F. Seitz, former president of the American National Academy of Sciences, and the one promoted by the Non-governmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC), whose 2009 report concludes that “Nature, not the activity of Man governs the climate”.
In conclusion, given the CRUCIAL IMPORTANCE THAT FOSSIL FUELS have for the energy supply of humanity, we suggest that they should not adhere to policies of uncritically reducing carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere with THE ILLUSORY PRETENSE OF CONTROLLING THE CLIMATE.

"This year the UK experienced its hottest winter day, its hottest Easter, its hottest day on record. That peak of 38.7C came as England’s men played Ireland at Lord’s, when MCC members in the pavilion were allowed to remove their jackets for the second year in a row – surely a sign of doom to match the best of Jericho’s trumpets. All around the cricketing world the climate emergency has started to bite, affecting everyone from elite players in their air-conditioned hotels to the two billion fans who play and watch in some of the most climate-sensitive places on the planet. And yet – despite the cancellation of club and school cricket in South Africa in 2018 because of drought; the movement of IPL matches because of lack of water; extreme flooding in the UK; the suspension of play due to air pollution during a Test in Delhi, and hurricanes devastating the Caribbean – cricketers and cricket authorities have shown no great inclination to stand up and shout about this threat to the game. The gold medal Olympians Helen Glover and Etienne Stott, who was arrested in April at the Waterloo Bridge Extinction Rebellion protests, were among 19 sports stars who wrote a letter to the Guardian last month calling for sports to reduce their climate footprint and sportsmen and women to lead the fight. No cricketers signed the letter. Nor have the ICC or any member boards joined the UN Sports for Climate Action Framework – which has members as varied as the Rugby League World Cup 2021 and Bowls Australia. Alas, the difficult file marked climate crisis seemed destined to sit forever on the pending shelf, until perhaps now, with Tuesday’s publication of the Hit for Six report. This follows where the Game Changer report of February 2018 dipped its toes, drilling deep into the climate data – not only detailing the impacts already felt by cricket-playing countries and the likely problems to come, but also discussing the impact these environmental changes will have on individual cricketers, particularly in situations of extreme heat. Experiments at the University of Portsmouth revealed that the heat produced by an international batsman with what is essentially a series of shuttle sprints between the wickets is equivalent to running 8km an hour. That’s 8km an hour in full cricket kit – long-sleeved shirts and trousers, padding and a helmet – for what could be eight hours in the hot sun. When the air temperature becomes higher than the skin temperature, the only way the body can try to cool down is through sweating – which becomes difficult when the skin is covered with protective clothing. The body becomes unable to function properly and this can result in anything from heat cramps to the medical emergency that is heatstroke. Joe Root is a case in point, taken to hospital during the Sydney Test of 2018 after retiring hurt with a combination of dehydration and a gastro-intestinal bug after playing in temperatures that peaked at 43.7C. Understandable, when you consider that the ideal temperature for exercise in light clothing is 10-11C. The report also details psychological responses to heat, with increased body temperature interfering with the efficiency of the human brain. While simple tasks, flipping a coin at the toss, should remain invulnerable to heat stress, more complex decisions – the report suggests, “vigilance (the ability to maintain attention, for example, when batting), short-term/working memory (for example a bowler remembering how the ball bounced off the pitch) and dual tasks (for example, a batter keeping an eye on an incoming delivery while simultaneously manoeuvring to take a shot)” become much more difficult – which, as cat follows mouse, will result in a less skilful and less watchable game. These stresses will also affect umpires – who, if not so active, stand for hours and have to make split-second decisions with unwavering concentration. To date, only Cricket Australia have any sort of rules surrounding heat – last August they introduced Heat Stress Risk Index Management Interventions – which involve mitigations from increasing the number of drinks breaks to, ultimately, suspending play. As anyone who has desperately waited for the temperature to fall during the suffocating torpor of a sweltering afternoon knows, these will not be short sharp rain breaks. What next, then? The report comes up with a page of suggestions that cricket would do well to heed. These range from encouraging all countries to come up with their own heat rules, and kit manufacturers to make heat-resistant clothing and equipment, even suggesting that cricketers should experiment with shorts, to suggesting authorities test players’ abilities under heat stress and, controversially, extend the length of tours to help acclimatisation. It points out authorities have a duty of care to children, who are less able to regulate their body temperatures. It calls on cricket to bear in mind that in times of climate crisis, authorities will prioritise food and drinking water, not watering cricket pitches, and recommends the setting up of an ICC global climate disaster fund. Much, then, to think about – before cricket even gets on the existential question of how it marries the constant desire for expansion with responsibility for the planet. As Kevin Mitchell, the prime minister of Grenada, writes in the report’s forward: “Climate change is real. It’s as simple as that. Every ball bowled at us is currently a bouncer. We’re ducking so much we’re struggling to build an innings that will ensure a safe, secure and sustainable future for our people.” • This is an extract taken from the Spin, the Guardian’s weekly cricket email.

Wind energy shows there is no free lunch. Some major drawbacks of this “green energy” supply include blighting of the landscape, health damage from infrasound, and bird killing. Now insect killing is another that is currently emerging.
Hat-tip: Die kalte Sonne
=================================
DLR studies interactions between flying insects and wind farms
Main points:

In a study, DLR researchers have investigated the interactions between flying insects and wind farms.
The model calculation used in the study indicates that the numbers of affected flying insects could be relevant for the stability of the flying insect population and thus influence species protection and the food chain.
The study does not conclude whether wind farms are the main cause of insect extinction or whether they have an impact on it.
The study recommends an empirical review of the losses theoretically calculated in the study in order to better understand the relationship between insect migration and wind farm operation, and to develop and implement measures to monitor and prevent insect strikes.

For 25 years, Franz Trieb has worked in the Energy Systems Analysis Department of the German Aerospace Center (Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt; DLR). The department of the same name at the DLR Institute of Engineering Thermodynamics in Stuttgart is investigating energy technologies with the idea of achieving comprehensive sustainability that takes into account ecological, economic and social factors, and has thus made a major contribution to the success of renewable energy sources in Germany and worldwide. Franz Trieb and his colleagues want to create a factual picture that will support discussions and decision-making processes. With its energy research, DLR is committed to developing technologies and scenarios for a sustainable energy system that meets the energy needs of industry and society.
Dr Trieb, how does one come up with the idea of investigating the impact of wind farms on flying insects?
Franz Trieb: A comprehensive assessment of German energy scenarios based on a large number of indicators, which we carried out in 2017[1], revealed that the compatibility of wind farms and flying insects during the migration of insects to new breeding grounds was still an open question. Initial research has shown that the remains of flying insects on rotor blades can lead to large reductions in the efficiency of wind turbines and have motivated the establishment of a global cleaning industry for rotor blades. For this reason, we conducted a study on the subject, drawing on interdisciplinary expertise in the fields of entomology, atmospheric physics, wind energy, aerodynamics and DNA barcoding – a method of species identification based on DNA sequencing.
What was the starting point for your study?
Trieb: An extensive body of technical literature currently shows that large swarms of flying insects also seek high, fast air currents. They allow themselves to be carried by the wind to distant breeding grounds. Observations and measurements have been able to detect high insect concentrations worldwide at altitudes between 20 and 220 metres above the ground – the very same altitudes occupied by the rotors of wind turbines. The phenomenon of insect strikes can reduce the power output of wind turbines by up to 50 percent – this has been the subject of extensive research in both theory and practice. So far, however, the consequences of insect collisions with wind turbine rotors on the insect population and the ecosystem have not been investigated.
What approach was used in your study? How did you proceed?

Trieb: First, we conducted extensive research, collecting and evaluating existing scientific data. Based on this data, we created our own model calculation. On the one hand, this model calculation is based on an average insect density of around three creatures per 1000 cubic metres of air at the level of the wind turbine rotors. This figure was based on regular insect catches over Schleswig Holstein by entomologists between 1998 and 2004[2]. On the other hand, for our model calculation, we extrapolated the volumetric flow, that is, the ‘air throughput’ of all the wind farms in Germany. Here, there are around 30,000 wind turbines with a total rotor area of around 160 square kilometres, which with a nominal wind speed of 50 kilometres per hour reach an average of 1000 nominal full load hours during the insect flying season from April to October. By simply multiplying these numbers, we calculated a seasonal air flow rate of about eight million cubic kilometres – that is more than 10 times the total German airspace up to a height of two kilometres. If one multiplies the insect density and airflow rate, then around 24,000 billion airborne insects fly through the rotors in Germany each year.
A simple approximation of the resulting damage can be derived from studies by Sandia National Laboratories on the contamination of rotor blades by flying insects. Four factors are multiplied with each other: the ratio (five percent) between the blade surface visible from the wind’s direction and the circular area swept by the rotor blades; the average proportion of the polluted blade area on both sides of the rotor blades totalling around 80 percent relative to the visible blade area; the so-called collection efficiency for winged insects averaging 40 percent; and a ratio between median relative blade speed (45 metres per second) and nominal wind speed (14 metres per second) of about 3.2. According to the figures, on average, about five percent of the creatures flying through a running rotor get hit. This amounts to approximately 1200 billion insects per year. These figures only consider creatures that leave visible residues on the rotor blades.
What conclusions can be drawn from your model calculation?
Trieb: Our model calculation points to an aspect of wind energy that has not yet been comprehensively researched. Approximately 1200 billion flying insects are struck each year as they fly through the rotors of wind farms in Germany. Such a large number of affected insects could be a relevant factor for the stability of the insect population and could thus influence species protection and the food chain.
What conclusions does the model calculation explicitly rule out? In other words, where do you as a researcher need additional data or more investigations?
Trieb: We cannot make any reliable statements as to what contribution the loss of approximately 1200 billion flying insects calculated in the study makes to the reduction of insect numbers. The reason for this is that we simply do not know how big the total population is or the amount of insect population reduction in hard numbers. In addition, there are as yet no absolute figures on other negative impacts on the insect population such as pesticides, intensive agriculture, climate change or urbanisation, so we cannot compare our numbers with other influences.
What further action would you suggest, based on the study results?
Trieb: From the currently available figures and the DLR model calculation, we cannot conclude either that wind energy plays a significant role in the reduction of insect numbers, or that it has no impact. From a scientific point of view, an empirical examination of the losses theoretically calculated in our study would be very useful as a next step. The goal must be to better understand the relationships between insect migration and wind farm operations. With this study we are offering our knowledge and expertise based on a one-year project, so that researchers from different disciplines, together with industry, operators and decision-makers can develop and implement measures to reduce potential environmental damage caused by wind farms in the future.
One idea would be, for example, an automatic swarm detection system that controls the rotors of wind turbines accordingly. A simple way to identify affected species would be a regular DNA analysis of insect residues on rotor blades. One potential source of damage that leaves no visible residue, and one that has not yet been investigated, is flying through the low pressure region on the forward side of the rotor blades. The effects of the corresponding barotrauma on the trachea and other organs should be examined.

The last two summers in Germany (2018 and 2019) were unusually dry and warm, and already alarmists began to screaming that this was just a preview of what’s in store for Europe’s crispy burnt future.
The following 2 charts show the ground moisture for Germany last September. The left image depicts the ground moisture at the depth of 25 cm, and the image on the right for a depth of 1.8 meters:

German indeed was unusually dry last September. Source: The drought monitor; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ)
February 2020 second wettest since records began
But the precipitation pendulum has swung to the other side. The German DWD national weather service now reports that February 2020 was the second wettest since records began. Only 1946 was wetter. Last month some parts of Germany saw rainfall that was double of what is normal.


In some regions it was even the wettest February, e.g. in Lower Saxony, Hamburg and Schleswig Holstein. The reason was a series of lows from the Atlantic moving directly over Germany.

Ground in many areas now over-saturated
Now the ground is well soaked down to the middle and deeper layers. In some parts of  Lower Bavaria and parts of eastern Germany, however, there is still dryness in some places at a depth of just under 2 metres. Yet, the situation is expected to ease there as well.

Currently much of Germany is over-saturated for the 0-60 cm ground depth:

More precipitation ahead
Moreover the 14-day forecast for Germany sees more precipitation ahead, which will further saturate the ground. Last year at this time, in the wake of the dry 2018 summer, the ground was much drier. So this year ground moisture levels will be in much better shape as summer approaches.
So, all the doom and gloom scenarios of severe drought and crop failures being the future of Germany have suddenly been washed away. Alarmists will have to go elsewhere to chase climate ambulances.

===============================
Ladies and Gentlemen,
New climate model is useless
Over 80(!) authors, led by Jean Christophe Golaz of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, have recently developed a new climate model (produced for the upcoming IPCC 6th Assessment Report). While so far the models have been parameterized on the basis of a period of pronounced warming (mostly between 1976 and 2005), the current work of Golaz et al (2019) takes a different approach: the pre-industrial conditions around 1850 were taken as the starting point.
Until around 1955 the model did well with the “tuning” of 1850, even though it did not reflect the warming of around 0.4°C between 1925 and 1945. After that, however, it literally goes out of control. We see a reduction in the temperature level of up to 0.5°C until about 1996, then a warming rate of over 0.5°C/decade. The observations do not show this:

The evolution of global surface temperatures in observations ( blue, green, grey) and in models ( red).  Source: Fig. 23 from Golaz et al. (2019).
The paper also explains how this happens: The aerosols (they cool by shading the solar radiation) have far too great an effect in the model and the climate sensitivity to greenhouse gases is also clearly too high. Björn Stevens of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology Hamburg (MPI) also addresses the problem that models compensate too high a sensitivity to greenhouse gases by too much (negative) aerosol forcing.
Natural variability not taken into account
It seems to be a fundamental problem of all models that do not sufficiently take natural variability into account and want to explain temperature development solely by anthropogenic influences. In the end, Golaz et al. (2019) comes to the conclusion that both the (negative) aerosol propulsion and climate sensitivity to greenhouse gases (especially CO2) must be reduced in models in order to simulate the recent past from 1960 onwards with the necessary precision.
“Little to do with reality”
For the declared purpose (the development of scenarios up to 2100 – i.e. the next 80 years), even the latest “sophisticated” models turn out to be unsuitable. They predict a catastrophic development because of faulty modeling that has little to do with the reality of the last 50 years.
Greta and the world of models

Greta and her German followers derive their demands for an immediate end to our lifestyle from this very false model world. In fact, climate researchers who are familiar with the unreliability of climate models should steer the children’s crusade to a sensible direction, for example with reference to the contribution by Jochem Marotzke, who recently came to the conclusion in Spiegel that “our remaining CO2 budget for the 1.5 degree target is probably at least twice as large as we thought it would be“.
Yet the very same Marotzke now supports the Fridays for Future demands for a short-term coal phase-out in Germany by 2030, bot in China where the annual CO2 increase is about as high as Germany’s total emissions. And Marotzke is assisted by climate researchers Claussen, Schellnhuber, Rahmstorf, Latif, Mosbrugger, Stocker and Anders Levermann (this is the one who claimed in the scientific committee of the German Bundestag that CO2 is an angled molecule and therefore a greenhouse gas).
He probably missed too many chemistry classes on Friday as well.
New headlines on environmentally friendly alternatives
The number of wind turbines is to be doubled to tripled in the course of the Energiewende [transition to green energies] energy revolution, one wind turbine every 2.7 km. But now there are new warnings about the environmental impact.
According to a DLR model analysis carried out at the end of 2018, flying insects (e.g. the admiral, ladybirds) seek high rapid air currents shortly before laying their eggs in order to be carried by the wind to distant breeding sites. The currents are above 60 -100 m and hit a rotor area of 200 million m². An air throughput of 10 million km³, which is more than ten times the German airspace (up to 200 m height), will be sucked in by the rotors.
1200 tonnes of insects to be destroyed
1200 tons of insects will be destroyed by the rotors, which is 1200 billion insects. One of the authors estimates that this corresponds to the size of the insects destroyed by 40 million cars. Remarkably, the decline of flying insects and the expansion of wind turbines over a total height of 100 m to 200 m coincided 15 years ago. Coincidence? We do not know.
“Shut down wind turbines from April to October”!
The scientists demand a shut down the wind turbines from April to October at temperatures above 10°C. For our parliamentarians in the German Bundestag: The Federal Agency for Nature Conservation has so far rejected an investigation.
Green Energies’ “Silent Spring”
Maybe our striking students should take a look at this topic in class. Because if the fear turns out to be true, it’s not just about flying insects, but also about the whole ecosystem. Silent Spring – without chemicals – simply through the transition to0 green energies without technology assessment. It started with corn crops and biogas and ends with wind turbines.

Share this...FacebookTwitterTwo more additions to the steadily accumulating evidence CO2 plays an insignificant to negligible role in climate change have recently been published in the scientific literature.
Last year, Dr. Rex J. Fleming, a former  NOAA climate scientist who earned both his Master’s and Ph.D in meteorology, published a paper (Fleming, 2018) in the Environmental Earth Sciences journal that detailed the lack of an identifiable causal relationship between CO2 concentration changes and Earth’s temperature.
Fleming theorized that the Earth has warmed in the modern era as a consequence of the strong solar activity during the 20th century  (the Modern Maximum) shielding cosmic ray intensification and thus reducing decadal-scale cloud cover, which leads to warming via an increase in absorbed surface solar radiation as illustrated here by Ogurtsov et al., 2012 and detailed by Avakyan, 2013, McLean, 2014, Herman et al., 2013, Goode and Palle, 2007, Loeb et al., 2018, Pokrovsky, 2019, and others.
Fleming has now published an expanded version of his 2018 paper in a Springer© book entitled The Rise and Fall of the Carbon Dioxide Theory of Climate Change.
He reaches the same conclusion: CO2 has “no role” in the process of influencing climate.

Image Source: Fleming, 2019
Another climate sensitivity paper (Krainov and Smirnov, 2019) published in the journal Atomic and Molecular Radiative Processes finds a negligible (0.02 K) warming contribution from human emissions.
Physicists Dr. Vladimir Krainov, atomic physicist, and Dr. Boris Smirnov, author of over a dozen physics textbooks – conclude “injections of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as a result of combustion of fossil fuesls is not important for the greenhouse effect.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt a strategy conference in Kassel last weekend, German leftist/environmentalist party Die Linke (The Leftists) discussed its plans for social change. Major German story here on this scandal.
The aim of the conference was to discuss how the leftist Die Linke could successfully intervene in fundamental social issues, “change the country for a social-ecological system change” and to protect the climate.
During a panel discussion, a Die Linke member woman in the front row, identified as Sandra L, took the floor. At the end of her ranting presentation, she felt it was important to emphasize that “a transition to renewable energies is also necessary after a revolution, and that after shooting the 1% rich people. we still want to heat.”

Some in attendance could be heard chuckling and applauding in response. But others could be heard murmuring in shock, and so Sandra L doubled down: “Well, it’s like this! We need to get off this meta-level.”
In attendance was also Die Linke leader Bernd Riexinger, who responded to the woman directly, saying: “I want to say,we don’t shoot them. We can use them for useful work!” For this he also received applause and laughter from the audience!
Just a misunderstanding, “taken out of context”

Soon the video of the incident was posted on Twitter and quickly went viral. German Twitter followers were aghast at the suggestion of shooting dead the 1% rich in the country. Before long the pressure mounted on party leader Riexinger to take back the comments, who shortly later claimed on Twitter that Sandra L’s comments were “completely taken out of context”.
“It was and is unacceptable. I regret that I did not immediately reject it unequivocally,” Riexinger commented.
“Abhor violence against people”
By evening, desperate to control the image damage to Die Linke, a party with about 10% of the vote in Germany, Sandra L was forced to tell the DPA German Press Agency: “I apologize for this statement, which I made in the excitement and thoughtlessness. It completely contradicts my political views, I abhor violence against people.”
“We need an active social and environmental energy policy. My statement did not serve this purpose,” she added.
Thuringia’s Minister President Bodo Ramelow (Die Linke) sharply denounced Sandra L’s comments on Twitter: “Anyone who wants to shoot people and rant about a revolution with or through violence has nothing in common with my set of values. The statement was unacceptable and should never have been passed over with a smile”.
It is unclear whether and which office Sandra L has in the extreme German Die Linke party.

"The Australian Medical Association has formally declared climate change a health emergency, pointing to “clear scientific evidence indicating severe impacts for our patients and communities now and into the future”. The AMA’s landmark shift, delivered by a motion of the body’s federal council, brings the organisation into line with forward-leaning positions taken by the American Medical Association, the British Medical Association and Doctors for the Environment Australia. The American Medical Association and the American College of Physicians recognised climate change as a health emergency in June 2019, and the British Medical Association the following month declared a climate emergency and committed to campaign for carbon neutrality by 2030. The World Health Organisation has recognised since 2015 that climate change is the greatest threat to global health in the 21st century, and argued the scientific evidence for that assessment is “overwhelming”. The AMA has recognised the health risks of climate change since 2004. Having now formally recognised that climate change is a health emergency, the peak organisation representing doctors in Australia is calling on the Morrison government to promote an active transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy; adopt mitigation targets within an Australian carbon budget; promote the health benefits of addressing climate change; and develop a national strategy for health and climate change. The AMA president, Tony Bartone, argues the scientific evidence is clear. “There is no doubt that climate change is a health emergency. The AMA accepts the scientific evidence on climate change and its impact on human health and human wellbeing,” he says. Bartone says the climate science suggests warming will affect human health and wellbeing “by increasing the environment and situations in which infectious diseases can be transmitted, and through more extreme weather events, particularly heatwaves”. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “Climate change will cause higher mortality and morbidity from heat stress,” the AMA president says. “Climate change will cause injury and mortality from increasingly severe weather events. Climate change will cause increases in the transmission of vector-borne diseases. Climate change will cause food insecurity resulting from declines in agricultural outputs. Climate change will cause a higher incidence of mental ill-health. “These effects are already being observed internationally and in Australia.” Bartone told Guardian Australia the motion adopted by the federal council had followed an ongoing discussion among stakeholders, and medical practitioners within the AMA membership. Health and medical groups, including Doctors for the Environment, the Climate and Health Alliance, the Royal Australian College of Physicians, and the Australian Medical Students’ Association wrote an open letter to all political parties in April pointing out the “significant and profound impacts climate change has on the health of people and our health system”. The AMA president said the decision to pass the motion followed on from those events both domestically and internationally, and was “pretty much unanimous” internally. “I don’t recall anyone speaking against it,” he said. Asked whether the current government was pursuing ambitious enough policy action to combat the risks of climate change, whichthe Morrison government argues it is, Bartone said “it’s really difficult to say because this issue is clouded in conjecture and conflicting reports”. He said all of the political groups in the Australian parliament had a responsibility to move past the toxic partisan politics that had characterised the debate and find durable solutions to a difficult public policy challenge. Bartone said the AMA would continue to assess the evidence about climate change as it emerged and update its stance to reflect the science. The latest official data released last week confirms that greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise in Australia. National emissions increased by 3.1m tonnes in the year to March to reach 538.9m tonnes, a 0.6% jump on the previous year. Emissions in Australia have increased every year since the Abbott government repealed a national carbon price after taking office in 2013."
"“You’re a black tree hugger, interesting.” When I told my grandparents that I was moving back to Detroit to work as an environmental justice organizer for the Sierra Club they chuckled and called me a tree hugger. This quip was understandable, their interactions with the environmental movement were not particularly positive; they contended that, in their time, most environmentalists cared more about protecting remote habitats than protecting their black neighbors from discrimination and violence. Today, to fight our climate crisis effectively, we have to transcend cultural, racial and political differences and build a broader coalition of engaged citizens. We have to engage all citizens, some who may not care about conservation but certainly care about the safety of their drinking water, the cleanliness of their air and the safety of their homes. This requires all of us, from journalists and politicians to activists and voters, to engage with communities in a culturally competent manner. We must bring to the table an understanding that we don’t have to agree on every political issue to work together towards building a better future for all of us.  Whether it be in Detroit, Birmingham or Houston, my lived experiences tell me that contrary to what has become a popular narrative, communities of color care about addressing the climate crisis. Our interests may not fit neatly into what has been deemed “environmental” thus far; nonetheless, we’re frustrated by injustices that permeate in the aftermath of natural disasters, we’re frustrated that our communities are littered with asthma because we stand on the fence lines of polluting industries, and we’re frustrated that, in the wealthiest nation on Earth, access to clean water seems ever so scarce. Learning how to connect to different communities, meeting people where they are and communicating in a way that brings people together, are cornerstones of culturally competent communication. It’s incumbent on activists, politicians, media figures and academics to embrace culturally competent communication to engage diverse communities in the climate crisis. When Kanye West proclaimed “George Bush doesn’t care about black people” in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, it resonated within many parts of the African American community and whether it was incompetence or negligence, it resonated for a reason. I was 10 at the time, living in Birmingham, Alabama, watching the horror unfold on TV with my mom. We watched images on our screen of black families stranded on rooftops and huddled into the Superdome, we saw racist coverage describe black residents as “looters” while describing others searching for food and supplies as “families desperate for help”, and we watched as all levels of government failed to take adequate steps to prepare and protect residents. In Houston, the most diverse city in the country, 11 years after Katrina, I witnessed similar disparities firsthand in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey. In my work as an organizer, I traveled to historic black neighborhoods, where blue tarps that were used to cover badly damaged roofs still line blocks as if they were a part of the architectural design of the neighborhood. At community health fairs in predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods of the city, I met countless families fighting tears because the mold that had overtaken their home had still not been adequately removed over a year after the storm. And as Hurricane Maria demonstrated to a wider audience, these systemic barriers to an equitable recovery are more widespread than we may like to acknowledge. These experiences have made it clear to me that our communities do care about climate’s role in driving natural disasters, we yearn for having a livable future for generations to come, and we want our lawmakers to take active steps to address climate change so that these disparities are no longer perpetuated. Since moving back to Detroit to continue my work as an environmental justice organizer, I have learned how to better communicate issues involving the climate crisis to communities often overlooked in these discussions. Access to clean air and water is a fundamental human right. Algae blooms, driven by the climate crisis, contaminate our freshwater supplies. However, when I talk to residents about the climate crisis’ detrimental effects on access to water, I talk about how these rights have been violated in Flint, I talk about Detroit’s mass water-shutoffs, and I talk about lead exposure in Detroit public school water. Climate change will only further entrench existing inequalities when it comes to access to water. When I talk about the relationship between the climate crisis and the fossil fuel industry, I talk about their proximity of oil refineries to our neighborhoods and the fact that this proximity impacts our ability to live healthy productive lives free from disease. The fact is, many oil refineries, coal plants and other industrial sites locate themselves adjacent to low-income communities of color. The lack of political, economic and social capital in our communities often render us helpless to fight back against these forces and this is why we organize. This is a racial justice, residential segregation and human rights issue that anyone involved in the environmental movement must learn to speak to. But improving our communications and outreach to communities often left out of the conversation is not enough. We need to fully shift and challenge how we group and categorize what environmentalism and “climate change issues” look like. When our climate crisis threatens the global economy, drives mass migration creating climate-linked refugees, and risks the health and wellbeing of countless communities there is no such issue that is solely related to the environment and climate. In poll after poll evaluating what voters care about, many voters place increasing access to economic opportunity, addressing racism and discrimination, and fixing our healthcare system above the environment and climate. The reality is, the climate crisis intersects all of these issues and failing to acknowledge this, whether in a poll, a news article or in a political debate, greatly diminishes the scale of the crisis we face. Why? Because instead of making investments in the economy of the future, particularly in green tech and manufacturing we have made investments in publicly financed stadiums, jails and tax cuts. Our communities stand on the edge of industrial zones not out of preference but out of redlining and racial segregation policies that packed us into those neighborhoods. And yes, we need to dramatically transform our broken healthcare system, but we also must recognize environmental injustice’s role in driving health disparities. There are many moments that we have come together in our nation’s history to build movements that meet the scale of the challenges we face: the civil rights movement, battling the Great Depression, the women’s right’s movement. The climate crisis is such an unprecedented threat because it compounds the challenges that we’ve faced: racial inequality, economic opportunity, access to a healthy environment. Unprecedented challenges require unprecedented approaches so it’s imperative that we all adjust the way we communicate and think about the environmental crisis. Our challenges may be many, but our struggles are linked, and we are capable of rising to this challenge."

"Sometimes it’s the students who teach. This week, 16-year-old Greta Thunberg arrived in New York City in a zero-emissions yacht, en route to the United Nations climate change summit. The purpose of the trip? Let’s call it a teachable moment. Over the past year, Greta and more than 2 million teens around the world have led school strikes for climate justice, demanding that their leaders end the age of fossil fuels. Now these young people have declared 20 September 2019 a historic day for a global climate strike by all people, young and old.  As college professors, we’ve learned much over the past 15 years from our Middlebury and Swarthmore students about standing up for climate justice. On the forefront of the climate movement, they’ve launched the worldwide fossil-fuel divestment campaign and gone on to found 350.org and the Sunrise Movement. Young brown, black and indigenous activists who have courageously stood up to powerful fossil fuel companies have taught us how all fights for justice intersect. So on 20 September, we plan to join youth everywhere, cancel our classes and strike. With seven colleagues, we’ve just released an open letter appealing to fellow educators everywhere: put aside your teaching notes and join your students at a climate strike event near you. As Greta puts it, “Our house is on fire – let’s act like it.” We understand that some educators – and their bosses – might object to striking. It’s true that school time is precious, and to teach is a revered responsibility. Some students’ families might take issue with a full day of cancelled classes. And let’s not forget those students who may not want to strike (even with the prospect of a day off from homework). To not teach, one might argue, is to reject learning. We disagree. To strike in the name of climate justice is a resounding endorsement of learning: it turns out the world’s youth have been listening to their teachers all along. They understand the science of climate disruption; they take in the lessons of history; they grapple with the complexity of market forces and the true costs of polluting. In their humanities and social science courses, they hear the voices of those at the margins and then honor their dignity and humanity through the arts. Yet it’s also undeniable that our students – all of us – have much more to learn about climate disruption and injustice. As educators worldwide plan our fall semester courses, we have, alas, plenty of new material to teach. July was the hottest month on record, the 415th straight month warmer than the 20th century average. Europe baked this summer, while Arctic and Greenland ice melted at record paces. Legacies of colonialism and global inequality continue to put black, brown and other marginalized people in harm’s way – in June, hundreds of Indian villages were evacuated in the face of historic drought – even though they are least responsible for the crisis. Alarm bells continue to toll, louder every year. That’s why, above all, we educators need to help strengthen the climate movement, and the start of this school year is an important moment. The eyes of the world are on young people, who are demonstrating the kind of vision and determination that has not yet taken hold in halls of power the world over. Our students love to declare, “We are the change we have been waiting for.” In fall 2019, they could not be more correct. No educator is able to join Greta Thunberg as she continues her bold Atlantic crossing, but all of us can follow her lead. We risk losing credibility with an entire generation of students if we cannot take action in support of the defining cause of their generation. Jonathan Isham is a professor of economics and environmental studies at Middlebury College. Lee Smithey is a professor of peace and conflict studies and sociology at Swarthmore College"

"And the Bible said: “God did not spare the angels when they sinned” (2 Peter 2:9). Nor, it seems, did God spare Billie Eilish. The 17-year-old pop star’s unsettling new video finds her a fallen angel, ejected from Heaven and landing on Earth to find it a deserted, fiery hellscape. “Peter’s on vacation, an open invitation,” she sings, against jaunty keys, suggesting that “even God herself … will want the Devil on her team”.  Tarred and feathered, Eilish eventually goes up in flames herself as, in the background, silhouetted women dance sexily, like the singers she has deliberately positioned herself against. The video for the single all the good girls go to hell (the insistently nonchalant lower-case formatting is hers) has amassed 37m views in just five days, reflective of the controversy the clip has caused in corners of the internet. On the Q&A website Quora, a conflicted fan fretted: “Can I be a good Christian and like Billie Eilish’s new music?” On Twitter, a woman responded to Eilish’s share of the video, saying: “Prayers sent.” “Nobody asked for your prayers, Tina” came another fan’s retort. Pop stars playing with religious iconography is hardly a new idea: in March, Madonna marked the 30th anniversary of the Like a Prayer video, wherein she danced in front of burning crosses, kissed a black saint and caused so much controversy she claims it cost her a multi-million-dollar deal with Pepsi. More recently, Lady Gaga portrayed herself as Mary Magdalene in the video for Judas, released close to Holy Week and Easter 2011, though Gaga said it was not a purposeful attack on religion: “The only controversial thing about this video is that I’m wearing Christian Lacroix and Chanel in the same frame,” she joked to E!. In July, the SoundCloud rapper Lil Uzi Vert invoked the Rapture during his set at Wireless festival in London, telling his fans that they were “going to Hell” with him and that his hit XO Tour Llif3 was “what it’s going to sound like for eternity”.  Far from becoming immune to the shock tactics, however, some Christians seem to find Eilish’s embrace of Satanic imagery especially concerning in light of her tender years. To quote from the Everyday Christian Parent blog: “Satan no longer hides, and kids think its [sic] cool. … Contrary to Billie Eilish’s songs of hopelessness, we have hope in Jesus.” A closer reading of Eilish’s lyrics suggests the outrage is misplaced: hills are burning in California, sea levels are rising, the Pearly Gates are a picket fence – far from idolising the devil, Eilish has confirmed the song is largely about the threat from the climate crisis. “The world’s being ruined by us, you know – it’s literally us,” she said of the song in an interview. And all the good girls will find themselves in Hell along with the bad girls when it eventually comes to Earth. Those looking for hope after watching Eilish’s video on YouTube might have found it in the description, where she has posted a personal note urging fans to take part in the global climate strikes on 20 and 27 September. The top tag is #climatestrike. And so Eilish’s glory is revealed – praise be to Billie. Elle Hunt"
"Ian Duncan, the UK’s minister for climate change (Letters, 31 August), vaunts our achievements and “ambitions to become one of the cleanest and most innovative energy systems in the world”. He allows a generous 30 years before a “net-zero emissions economy is achieved”, when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has made it clear that real change must be evident in fewer than a dozen years. How can he hope to realise his longer-term targets while pursuing fracking as a transitional fuel? Investment in the hugely expensive development of fracking denies proper support to cheaper renewables, and delaying the switch ties the operator and investor into the production of a fossil fuel until a return is achieved. That exposes communities to the harms already documented, and contributes – by combustion, extraction and transportation – to the climate change the government hopes to mitigate.  The De Pfeffel Johnson government is a prey to the same “cognitive dissonance” as characterised previous governments, its fracking agenda running openly against the spirit of its commitments.David Cragg-JamesStonegrave, North Yorkshire • Ian Duncan omits to mention the government’s environmentally damaging actions. Why is fracking still being encouraged? And airport expansion? And why is several times more given in subsidies supporting fossil-fuel industries such as North Sea oil than renewables, which have seen a reduction? And why was car tax changed so that smaller engined cars now pay the same as larger ones, thus leading to an increase in the sale of SUVs? Any why remove the grant towards the purchase of plug-in electric hybrids and charge them the same vehicle tax as diesel or petrol cars? I’m sure there are many more examples of failure to have a coherent, consistent and powerful regime to address the climate crisis.Michael MillerSheffield • Carol Blumenthal says peaceful civil disobedience and personal sacrifice are perhaps the only effective tools to bring about system change (Letters, 31 August). She misses one other: voting. In the 1945 general election it brought about one of the most far-reaching changes in our society: the welfare state. For better or for worse, it was voting – in 2010, 2016 and 2017 – that created and sustained the Brexit crisis. If every voter who believed in the importance of saving our environment voted for a party that unreservedly supported it, the political climate would be transformed overnight. If we don’t, then we only have ourselves to blame. In politics, all too often, we really do get what we ask for.Charles HarrisLondon  • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

"Will Hutton hits the nail on the head (“The sheer scale of the crisis facing our decrepit constitution has been laid bare”, Comment). Our “constitution” is palpably broken and needs replacing. The key elements he wants in the new version are precisely those we have needed for a long time: federalism, an elected head of state and a fair voting system. While priority must be given to ensure that we do not crash out of the EU on 31 October, the need for a Speaker’s conference to draft a new constitution should be pretty high on the agenda. One is reminded of the Tennis Court Oath taken by the members of the French Third Estate in 1789 when they vowed not to dissolve until they had given their country a constitution. MPs would do well to swear something similar this week.Andrew McLuskeyAshford, Middlesex  Will Hutton is correct to say that Switzerland has elaborate rules for the conduct of referendums. Any citizen or organisation that collects a defined number of signatures can demand that a referendum be held. The exact wording is drawn up by civil servants and constitutional lawyers in discussions with the proposers to ensure that voters know precisely what they are being asked to agree to. It is even permitted to propose a motion to strike down legislation recently approved in parliament. This ingenious balance between direct democracy and representative democracy has the enormous benefit that legislation for significant change is couched in moderate terms for fear of subsequent rejection by the people. Under such a system, the Brexit vote wouldn’t even have reached the starting line.Karl GehringSheffield Nick Cohen says that the Brexit movement “has no purpose now other than to secure an empty victory” (Comment). It has been clear from the outset that the people behind Brexit have very clear intentions. The EU is a capitalist entity that not only rejects the worst aspects of the US system but has the clout to resist its encroachments. The disaster capitalists who want to discard laws designed to limit the ill effects of capitalism on employment, the environment, the climate, food, health etc and unleash an unrestricted race to the bottom will get even richer if Brexit goes through. This was always the purpose behind Brexit, whatever lies have been put up to hide it. These are not people who will be harmed by a no-deal Brexit; on the contrary, the potential to take advantage of it is almost unlimited.Jeremy CushingTaddyforde, Exeter My experience was similar to that of Sophie Hastings’s daughter (“Why my daughter said no to Oxbridge”, Focus). I grew up in a working-class family in Barrow-in-Furness and at sixth-form college, it was clear that I was expected to apply to Oxbridge.  When the vice-principal, a Cambridge alumnus, took several of us on a visit it seemed a stuffy place to a young man from such a different environment. The trip did a good job of deterring me, but there was still pressure from staff at my college. So I applied to Oxford, did well in the exam, was successful at interview and was made an offer of 2 grade Es. After I rejected Oxford, selecting Warwick, Oxford told my college that it wasn’t too late for me to change my mind and I was called to a meeting with the vice-principal. I remained adamant. When the A-level results came out, the local newspaper had photos of the highest achieving students. Mine was captioned: “Damian Rogan: turned down place at Oxford.”Damian RoganLondon, E16 Peter Beaumont (“WWII: eighty years on, the world is still haunted by a catastrophe foretold”, Comment) blames the allied governments, most notably the British and the American ones, for failing to offer relief to the persecuted Jews of Europe, despite the unequivocal evidence of the horrors taking place. He relates the resistance offered by authorities on both sides of the Atlantic, for a variety of reasons, to the very idea of offering sanctuary to the threatened Jews. No doubt this resistance played its part, but surely the crux of the inaction lay in Anthony Eden’s statement to parliament after Ed Morrow’s radio broadcast in 1942: the “immense geographical and other difficulties in the matter”. Bombing of the camps and railways may have been considered impractical (although that might have seriously disrupted the mechanised killing), but the options for Jews already locked inside a Nazi-occupied Europe were virtually non-existent. Some in southern France may have been able to escape into neutral Spain or Portugal, and from there to the US or Britain, but the vast majority would have had no chance of reaching friendly shores, especially the millions trapped inside Poland or the Soviet Union.  Even if there had been more political will to do something to prevent further slaughter of the Jews, in practice there was very little that could be done before the camps were overrun towards the end of the war and it is unfair to the wartime allied leaders to suggest that they could have prevented the Holocaust.Melvin HurstVentnor, Isle of Wight It is disappointing to see that prominent cultural figures Grayson Perry and Olivia Colman, who, one would hope, would put their popularity to good use as beneficial social influencers, are instead encouraging the perpetuation of environmentally damaging behaviour (“Strikes, IT failures, customer unrest: can BA pull out of this nosedive?”, Business). At a time when we must transform our way of life, including a significant reduction in flying, in order to avoid the worst effects of global heating, I hope they will both recognise their mistake and find a way to make amends.Teresa BeltonNorwich Fast fashion is not qualitatively different to most other consumer industries in its impact upon the environment (“Can fashion keep its cool?”, Special Report). Consumer goods in general are too cheap, leading to over-consumption and waste, while things that improve the quality of our lives are too expensive (decent housing) or increasingly unavailable (public services). We need higher taxes on most goods (as well as on high incomes and wealth) to fund housebuilding, green public transport and other public expenditure.Richard MountfordTonbridge, Kent The MSC Gülsün’s containers (“The shifting patterns of English: Measurements that are meaningless”, Comment), being stacked outside the hull, are built of steel to withstand the onslaught of waves, the weather and the ship’s pitching and rolling during a long ocean voyage. Today, most containers being FEUs (40ft equivalent units), the Gülsün can carry up to 11,878 FEUs, each weighing 3.6 tons empty.

Black lives matter only rarely to those claiming they matter.

“Not oppressed!” Outspoken US black woman, immigrant, tells protesters and rioters to go home, get a job. Image: Breitbart
It’s not surprising the biggest sinners are usually those first in line to cast stones. The killing of George Floyd reveals how there are so many among us who hypocritically fancy themselves as being morally superior when in fact they are morally bankrupt.
Sadly, black lives matter only when there are political dividends to be gained
When it comes to the centuries old racial problems and disparities, which we not only have seen in USA, but worldwide, there’s plenty of blame to go around. Yet we see so many righteously pointing the finger at everyone else but themselves.
Black Lives Matter, except…
Black lives of course definitely do matter, but in many cases it seems they really don’t. The next time you hear some pompous, leftist blowhard screaming to the USA: “Black Lives Matter!”, ask them why they always keep their eyes closed and barely lift a finger everywhere else. Examples:
Black Lives Matter,
…except the hundreds of African refugees who pompous Europeans let drown in the Mediterranean each year. Why no riots?
Black Lives Matter,
…except the millions who have been killed by Planned Parenthood abortion camps.
Black Lives Matter,
…except those who see their businesses destroyed by BLM rioters.
Black Lives Matter,
…except those who try to prevent looting.
Black Lives Matter,
…except the hundreds killed by other blacks each month, in places like Chicago.
Black Lives Matter,
…except the thousands who die from drugs trafficked in over porous borders.
Black Lives Matter,
…except those dying of poverty due to 5 decades of failed leftist welfare policies.

Image Source: Mikkelson et al., 2018
A new paper (Axford et al., 2019) reveals NW Greenland’s “outlet glaciers were smaller than today from ~9.4 to 0.2 ka BP” (9,400 to 200 years before 1950), and that “most of the land-based margin reached its maximum Holocene extent in the last millennium and likely the last few hundred years.”
The authors conclude:
“We infer based upon lake sediment organic and biogenic content that in response to declining temperatures, North Ice Cap reached its present-day size ~1850 AD, having been smaller than present through most of the preceding Holocene.”
Furthermore, the authors assert Greenland was 2.5°C to 3°C warmer than modern on average during the Holocene Thermal Maximum, and peak temperatures were 4°C to 7°C warmer.

Image Source: Axford et al., 2019
Another new paper ( Schweinsberg et al., 2019) indicates the most pronounced glacier expansion in West Greenland has occurred during the last 2,000 years.
“Our records reveal asynchronous regrowth of GIC between ~4.3 and 2 ka emphasizing the variable responses of individual glaciers to late Holocene climate changes on Nuussuaq. The subsequent millennia were characterized by gradually increasing glacier size in accordance with gradual declining summer insolation. Superimposed on the progressive increase in glacier growth are frequent, high-amplitude GIC fluctuations throughout the late Holocene; the most significant periods of GIC expansion occurred at ~3.7 and 2.8 ka, and throughout the past ~2 ka.”

Image Source: Schweinsberg et al., 2019
The authors cite a Greenland Ice Sheet temperature reconstruction showing modern temperatures (extending through 2015) are not unusual in the context of the last 10,000 years.

Image Source: Schweinsberg et al., 2019
The source for the Schweinsberg et al. (2019) Greenland temperature reconstruction is Kobashi et al., 2017, who concluded a) Greenland was about 2.9°C warmer than today during the Early Holocene, b) there has been no obvious net warming since the 1930s, and a c) slight cooling trend since 2005 (in accord with North Atlantic cooling).

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe censorship of science now sweeping the globe finally gets a slap-down…

Germany’s Dieter Nuhr slams “McCarthy-like mood” in science after DFB German Research Foundation takes down his statement. Image cropped from nuhr.de/
A message to Ramstorf, Mann, Greta, media, alarmists who declare their science as The Truth.
German, high profile satirist Dieter Nuhr, who earlier criticized Greta’s hysteria, recently saw his statement taken down by the German Research Foundation (DFG) in the latest wave of scientific censorship. 
What follows is Nuhr’s response to the DFG takedown of his statement he posted at Facebook, translated in the English (my emphasis added)
===========================================
“In July I was asked to send in a 30-second voice message on science for the German Research Foundation’s campaign #DFG2020. I made the following original statement:
‘Knowledge does not mean you are 100% sure, but that you have enough facts to have a reasoned opinion. But many people are offended when scientists change their mind: That is normal! Science is just THAT the opinion changes when the facts change. This is because science is not a doctrine of salvation, not a religion that proclaims absolute truths. And those who constantly shout, “Follow science!” have obviously not understood this. Science does not know everything, but it is the only reasonable knowledge base we have. That is why it is so important.’

‘The DFG would like to start by thanking you for your contribution.’ It wrote to me: ‘We thank you very much for your wonderful statement – your trenchant commentary on the relevance and explanation of science.’
The article was then published by the DFG and, due to the ‘strong and very critical response’, was taken down again on July 30th to ‘protect the DFG’ (quoted verbatim).
I find this more than alarming. The fact that criticism comes up when I express myself does not surprise me anymore. No matter what I say, as soon as it becomes public on the Internet, it gets met with organised hate. This is obviously a campaign organized in the Internet to discredit me as a participant in the forming of opinion. It is obvious that this is ideologically based, because I am politically critical of the left AND the right and I am always against any political extremism. This outrages both left and right fanatics, and since I also repeatedly express criticism of religion, I am also criticized from the religious side. As a satirist, you have to live with that.
What’s new is now an organization like the German Research Foundation, which should stand for free thinking like no other, is giving in to the ideologues on the Internet. This is not only astonishing, but also frightens me, because I now perceive a McCarthy-like mood in the country and, in the course of the Cancel culture, I also see the freedom of thought and research in general in danger.
I have been told by the DFG that it is necessary to ‘give in to criticism’ in order to ‘avert damage from the DFG’. I fear that the greater damage will be done if the German Research Foundation is involved in silencing critical and by no means extremist or conspiracy-theoretical voices.
I have never (!!!) argued in an anti-scientific way; on the contrary, I have always stood up against the misuse of science. One example: I have ALWAYS said that I think the Friday For Future movement is basically sympathetic, but that I find the phrase “Follow science” questionable because it suggests that there is one, untouchable opinion and solution strategy for climate change, because this way science is declared a narrative of redemption. That is the opposite of science.
There are different scenarios and different solution strategies not only among the population but also among climate scientists. It is even a basic condition of free research that different theses are allowed and discussed. This is what happens in science. In the public, however, diversity of opinion is increasingly actively suppressed by denunciation. Individual groups proclaim inviolable truths, claim that science is on their side and accordingly treat critical thinkers as heretics, then lump them together with madmen and conspiracy theorists and try to discredit them. That is Dark Ages and frightening.
In these times, shit-storms are increasingly replacing factual argumentation. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE RESPONSIBLE PEOPLE AT THE DFG TO HAVE FOUND SOMETHING “ANTI-SCIENTIFIC” IN ME, IF ONLY BECAUSE IT DOES NOT EXIST. They ‘reacted to criticism’. In other words, the DFG submitted to the rioters who systematically work on the Internet to suppress critical voices at the center of the political spectrum. No one can seriously place me on the fringes of politics anywhere.
The DFG is thus actively involved in pursuing criticism as heresy and muzzling dissenters. However, I consider this to be a phenomenon that seriously endangers democratic discussion, if only because it has reached the scientific community worldwide. At universities, however, massive efforts are being made everywhere to ensure that dissenters are no longer allowed in at all. This is not only outrageous, but frightening. What kind of country do we want to live in? In a country where public reflection is increasingly punished by denunciation and social exclusion? It scares me.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterLeading German climate science critic Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt has penned a commentary at Achgut.de titled: “How climate models inflate climate sensitivity.”

Image: GWPF
CO2 climate overblown
Vahrenholt cites Lewis/Curry 2018, who concluded “1.3°C for a doubling of the CO2 content of the atmosphere by about the end of this century (transient climate response), 1.7°C for a long-term equilibrium (ECS) in the period 2150 to 2200.
The German professor added: “Papers which examined historical periods (last glacial maximum to pre-industrial) do not contradict these low figures.”
Vahrenholt, co-author of The Neglected Sun, says that it’s been explained at his Die kalte Sonne site how “climate models are too hot” and that they do not fit with the observations”.
Overheated models a threat to movements
“If models and reality do not fit together, scientists should rather question their models,” says Vahrenholt. “This would mean that the much more dramatic sensitivity estimates of the last IPCC model observations – 1.86°C for TCR and 3°C for ECS – would have to be thrown overboard.” This of course would result in undermining the current Fridays for Future movement and plans by governments to tax CO2.

Activists currently blame the mismatch between models and observations on temporary “internal variability” events and that the warming will become “much stronger on a global scale in accordance to the models,” says Vahrenholt. But the IPCC’s and activists’ claims are being severely challenged by studies, such as Dong et al (2019), Vahrenholt comments.
Once again models fail
In Dong et al, which looks at the Tropical Pacific, it is shown how “once again the models fail because of the clouds!”
“It is therefore a clear physical mechanism that leads to the observed stronger warming of the tropical West Pacific leading to lower global sensitivities (= stronger negative global feedback),” the German professor of chemistry writes. “Climate models have such large deficits in the depiction of events in the tropical Pacific that they wrongly determine the global response to drivers and systematically overestimate the sensitivity to CO2 as a driver, a second paper by Seager et al of Columbia University in the respected scientific journal “Nature” (!) from July 2019 shows.”
“The failure of state-of-the-art models to capture the correct response introduces critical error into their projections of climate change,” Seager et al concluded.
But Germany’s leading climate science critic does not expect the IPCC to take all the errors into account when it puts out its forthcoming progress report. That would be a heck of a huge mess for the IPCC and an embarrassment to climate science and overzealous climate policymakers.
IPCC will go on pretending
“Then hundreds of pages dealing with model projections would have to be critically revised,” comments Vahrenholt. So for the IPCC, it’s best to just simply ignore all the inconvenient science and to go on pretending.
Vahrenholt concludes: “Politics is hot because the models are too hot. Which scientists have the courage and are ready to accept their responsibility to enlighten FFF and policymaking?”

Recently I tweeted that according to NASA GHCN V3 data, three of 4 stations in Iceland saw no warming from 1922 – 2018:

In Iceland, 3 of 4 stations have been a cooling or there has been no warming trend from 1922 to 2018, according to GHCN V3 Unadjusted data.GHCN V4 Unadjusted data shows how NASA changed the temperature data during the same period.#地球温暖化? #温暖化？ #気候変動 #ClimateChange pic.twitter.com/XjCe4KCqjg
— キリエ (@KiryeNet) April 1, 2020

But then NASA adjusted the V3 data and called it GHCN V4 “unadjusted”. The chart shown above in my tweet toggles between the prior V3 chart and the “unadjusted” V4. See the difference?
Note how the lack of warming has been removed and now the V4 data show modest warming. The missing heat was found – in the statistics! So in a sense, global warming has been “man-made” – done through statistical fudging and not human activity.
Greenland
Today we also take a look at Greenland. The map that follows shows the location of the stations we’ve been looking at:

Looking at Greenland V4 mean annual temperatures at the Nuuk and Tasiilaq stations, we see the following plots:

Here even NASA’s V4 data still show no warming. In fact we saw pronounced cooling from the 1960s to the early 1990s. Since 2002, Greenland temps have stabilized.
Recent findings confirm cooling
In fact a 2017 paper by Kabashi et al shows a downward trend “in accordance with a North Atlantic-wide cooling”:


Greenland’s glaciers stable

So no wonder Greenland’s glaciers have stopped appearing in alarmist headlines. After the brief 1990-2010 period of  melting, Greenland’s ice sheet mass losses have significantly decelerated since 2013 – a reversal from the rapid retreat from the 1990s to 2012 driven by cloud forcing and the NAO (Ruan et al., 2019).
The 47 largest Greenland glaciers also experienced a “relatively stable” period of rather insignificant retreat from 2013 to 2018 (Andersen et al., 2019).
Only 21 of the 47 Greenland glaciers retreated in 2018, 12 advanced, and the other 14 showed no trends in either direction (Polar Portal, 2019).
Greenland’s largest glacier, Jakobshavn, earned headlines in 2019 for its surprising and non-predicted rapid thickening in recent years.


Image Source: BBC, 2019
In short, absolutely zero alarm up in Greenland – unless your concern is cooling.

What follows is a field report from Hanover, Germany, by AGW skeptic organization KlimaKontroverse, who have attempted on multiple occasions to seek a rational dialogue with FridaysforFuture (FFF) demonstrators. Though some demonstrators were civil and polite, others harassed, defamed and even brought in Antifa.
Intolerant times
Taking a different view at a political demonstration in Germany is a risky affair, and could get you a bloody nose, or worse. So it really is an act of courage for these climate skeptic KlimaKontroverse citizens to go out to present their non-conforming views at these FFF demonstrations – especially when one considers how emotionalized and radical some have become.
As Greta has demonstrated herself, there’s lots of pent-up anger, impatience and intolerance out there.
Staying calm and respectful
Personally, as author of this blog, I’m actually considering showing up and joining KlimaKontroverse at an upcoming event. I’m a bit familiar with the KlimaKontroverse people, and I can assure you they are calm, friendly, respectful and go the extra mile to avoid provocation and confrontation.
=============================================
FridaysForFuture – and dealing with alternative opinions
by Klaus Öllerer
(German text translated, edited by P. Gosselin)
The FridaysForFuture movement has strict targets that would mean drastic consequences for all of the people living here. But what if you disagree? What if, after an intensive study of these issues, completely different conclusions emerge? Of course, it is obvious to go and discuss them – as is customary in democracy. Or perhaps better – should be usual again.First we began with e-mails and telephone calls offering discussion. No reaction. No willingness to talk to each other. FridaysForFuture did not react.
Some polite, respectful demonstrators
So we went to the climate strike meetings at Kröpcke, distributed our “Open Letter” and tried to get into conversation. Some conversations with participants were constructive and in the spirit of mutual respect. We listened to each other. That was nice.
“Stalking” and intimidation

But some leading persons and FFF orderlies reacted very differently. They stalked us and demanded we leave the square as they grew increasingly angry. We insisted on our democratic right to express our opinion freely in public space. At some point they also approached the police – but the officers agreed with us. We distributed our flyers and discussed with demonstrators (15 February 2019).
“Climate lies”
But at the next demonstration, the FridaysForFuture orderlies thought of something special, and it looked like this: The FFF orderlies brought a bag with the inscription “Klimalügen” (climate lies) and spoke to the passers-by and demonstrators who had taken our flyers. If they managed to convince a passer-by to surrender the flyer, they threw it in the “climate lies” bag. The finale: Our flyers were demonstratively torn in front of our eyes. (15 March 2019).

 

“Bomb” threat
At one of the next demonstrations, we had set up our stand just across from the Hanover main station. The demonstration passed by. The left picture below shows leftist autonomists and Antifa marching up front. They called out aggressively: “Climate deniers! Climate deniers! …”.
Then suddenly someone from the march charged towards our stand (middle picture), threw something under our table and shouted “Bomb!” before quickly running away and rejoining the marchers (right picture). The thrown object turned out to be harmless (5 July 2019).

But even so, KlimaKontroverse.de’s offer to enter a dialogue and to discuss in the truly democratic tradition remains open.

For a long time it has been said that the Medieval Warm Period was a purely North Atlantic phenomenon. This has proved to be wrong.
On 29 June 2019, a paper by Lüning et al. 2019 on the Medieval Warm Period in Antarctica appeared in the trade journal Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology. Here is the abstract:
The Medieval Climate Anomaly in Antarctica
The Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) is a well-recognized climate perturbation in many parts of the world, with a core period of 1000–1200 CE. Here we are mapping the MCA across the Antarctic region based on the analysis of published palaeotemperature proxy data from 60 sites. In addition to the conventionally used ice core data, we are integrating temperature proxy records from marine and terrestrial sediment cores as well as radiocarbon ages of glacier moraines and elephant seal colonies. A generally warm MCA compared to the subsequent Little Ice Age (LIA) was found for the Subantarctic Islands south of the Antarctic Convergence, the Antarctic Peninsula, Victoria Land and central West Antarctica. A somewhat less clear MCA warm signal was detected for the majority of East Antarctica. MCA cooling occurred in the Ross Ice Shelf region, and probably in the Weddell Sea and on Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf. Spatial distribution of MCA cooling and warming follows modern dipole patterns, as reflected by areas of opposing temperature trends. Main drivers of the multi-centennial scale climate variability appear to be the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) which are linked to solar activity changes by nonlinear dynamics.
With the publication of this paper, the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) has now been confirmed on all four continents of the southern hemisphere. While the largest part of the southern hemisphere apparently experienced a warm phase during the MCA, there were also isolated areas that cooled down. To the latter regions belong, for example, coasts, where cold water from the depth rose increasingly. In other areas so-called climate seesaws or dipoles were active, as we know them from today’s climate. One end of the “seesaw” heats up, the other end cools down.

Another result of the studies is that the medieval climate history of huge areas in the southern hemisphere is simply unknown. A task force urgently needs to be set up to fill in this climatic “empty space” with information on pre-industrial temperature development. This information is urgently needed to calibrate the climate models on the basis of which far-reaching socio-political planning is currently taking place.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA new paper published in the Journal of Weather and Climate Extremes by Dittus et al confirms what many skeptics has strongly suspected all along: There’s no trend in precipitation extremes and there isn’t much predictability either.
Hat-tip: Reader Mary Brown.
 

What follows is the paper’s abstract:
The oceans are a well-known source of natural variability in the climate system, although their ability to account for inter-annual variations of temperature and precipitation extremes over land remains unclear. In this study, the role of sea-surface temperature (SST)-forcing is investigated for variability and trends in a range of commonly used temperature and precipitation extreme indices over the period 1959 to 2013. Using atmospheric simulations forced by observed SST and sea-ice concentrations (SIC) from three models participating in the Climate of the Twentieth Century Plus (C20C+) Project, results show that oceanic boundary conditions drive a substantial fraction of inter-annual variability in global average temperature extreme indices, as well as, to a lower extent, for precipitation extremes. The observed trends in temperature extremes are generally well captured by the SST-forced simulations although some regional features such as the lack of warming in daytime warm temperature extremes over South America are not reproduced in the model simulations. Furthermore, the models simulate too strong increases in warm day frequency compared to observations over North America. For extreme precipitation trends, the accuracy of the simulated trend pattern is regionally variable, and a thorough assessment is difficult due to the lack of locally significant trends in the observations. This study shows that prescribing SST and SIC holds potential predictability for extremes in some (mainly tropical) regions at the inter-annual time-scale.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterTree-ring evidence reveals recent cooling and glacier thickening in Central Asia as well as flat temperatures throughout the last 432 years.


Tree rings were the proxy used by Dr. Michael Mann to invent the orignal hockey stick graph.
Twenty years later, yet another reconstruction (1580 to 2012 AD) indicates modern warmth in Central Asia is not unusual in the context of the last 432 years.
In fact, there was a recent cooling period, in line with natural variability, that was accompanied by regional glacier mass gains.
Byambaa et al., 2019
“[T]he recent cool-moist period from 1985 to 2000 has been related to the Arctic Oscillation (this study, Robock, 1984, He et al., 2017). The recent cooling could have been caused by volcanic aerosols of the El Chichón eruption (VEI5, 1982) in Southern Mexico, which impacted atmospheric wind patterns, including a positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation (Robock, 1984). No large volcanic-induced cooling was observed at this time due to the simultaneous warming ocean temperature caused by El-Niño (Robock, 2002). Also, the positive AO competing with ElNiño could reinforce the anomalous westerlies in the midlatitudes (He et al., 2017). During this recent cool-moist period, ice mass accumulation of the glaciers in the Russian Altai Mountains was observed and Narozhniy and Zemtsov (2011) connected this phenomenon to annual precipitation increased by 8% – 10% especially in winter and spring (April-May) as a result of a strengthening of the zonal circulation over the Altai Mountains.”

“Where do we end up if a scientist’s degree of alarm becomes a litmus test for his scientific respectability?” Science activism represents “relapse into pre-enlightened thinking”. 

Dogmatists refusing to look through Galileo’s telescope. Image cropped here.
The false prophets
Over the recent years, we’ve seen a number of alarmist climate scientists demanding we believe that they are the beholders of the truth, and so policymakers need to heed their advice without question.
Science hubris
That hubris has gotten so dreadful that journalist Thea Dorn has since felt compelled to pen a commentary appearing in the centre-left Die Zeit: “Don’t preach, do research instead!”
Rather than arrogantly declaring that the science is settled, scientists shine through by remaining doubtful, Dorn writes.
She warns of climate scientists having become “ideologists” in the climate debate, and that this is threatening to happen in epidemiology/virology as well.
Not acceptable to defame doubters

“There is a world of difference between an irrational dogmatist and a reasonable skeptic, Thea Dorn writes. “It is not acceptable to immediately defame anyone who expresses doubts about the reliability of epidemiological or climate models as a ‘climate’ or ‘corona denier'”.
In Germany there have been a number of renowned virologists who have recently come under fire for dissenting against the alarmist claims made by other virologists.
Dorn writes: “In contrast to religion, modern science owes its success to its openness to doubt, criticism and self-correction.”
Rahmstorf suggestion “absurd”
Thea Dorn particularly fires harsh criticism at Prof. Stefan Rahmstorf, alarmist scientist at the Potsdam Institute, for suggesting in an essay in Spiegel in 2019 that mankind somehow had control over the “earth system” but was losing that control, an assumption that Dorn called “absurd and highly questionable”.
Dorn slams Rahmstorf and Prof. Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber for mischaracterizing the earth’s complexity as a mere set a dominoes on the verge of toppling, and claiming they have the models to predict the future, and they and the alarmist virologists and immunologists should be heeded.
Be thankful for skeptics
On the role of skeptics, Dorn writes: “On the contrary: we can be thankful that – still? – there are enough scientists who reject the magic of the crystal ball and the delusion of total controllability.”
Science crusaders
Dorn also sharply criticizes the concept of the “activist scientist”, which Hans Joachim Schellnhuber calls himself. She comments: “It represents a relapse into pre-enlightened thinking. With a slogan like “Unite behind the Science!” one might swear crusaders to a holy mission.”
Dorn summarizes:
One of the most tragic acts that a democracy can commit is self-submission to the rigid rules of a clerical natural science for fear of submission to the power of nature.”

This could result in “a significant contribution of ice melt to the ice-drainage system of Greenland” (Artemieva et al., 2019).
Evidence of more than 100,000 formerly or currently active volcanic vents permeate the Earth’s sea floor (Kelley, 2017).
Active volcanoes spew 380°C sulfuric acid and “metal-laden acidic fluids” into the bottom waters of the world ocean on a daily basis. In other words, literal ocean acidification is a natural phenomenon.
The carbon dioxide concentrations present in these acidic floods reach “astounding” levels, dwarfing the potential for us to even begin to appreciate the impact this explosive geothermal activity has on the Earth’s carbon cycle (Kelley, 2017).

Geothermal heat “explains the observed melting of the ice sheet’s base”
Just as impacts of sea floor volcanism may be largely unheralded, the ice-melt significance of high geothermal heat flux beneath the polar ice caps may still be in the early stages of exploration.
The geothermal heat contribution to the basal melt rates of Antarctic glaciers is substantial.

Significant melting at the base of the north-central and northeastern Greenland ice sheet occurs in close proximity to high geothermal heat flux regions, and “several thousands” of 55-62°C hot springs have been identified “all over Greenland.”

Image Source: Rogozhina et al., 2016, Rysgaard et al., 2018
High geothermal heat flux has “dramatic consequences” for ice basal melting in central-eastern Greenland
In a new paper, Dr. Irina Atemieva employs a new method to assess the accelerated basal melting occurring across wide swaths (extending 500 kilometers inland) of the Greenland ice sheet associated with high geothermal heat flux.
“Huge” near-surface temperature anomalies reaching amplitudes of 800–1000 °C have been spotted.
Geothermal heat flux is suggested to be “an important contributor to the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream in Central Greenland.”
Artemieva, 2019
Lithosphere thermal thickness and geothermal heat 
flux in Greenland from a new thermal isostasy method
“East Greenland has anomalous crustal structure, thin (50-100 km) lithosphere, high mantle temperatures and a strong GHF [geothermal heat flux] anomaly of >100 mW/m2 centered in the Fjordland region. … High GHF [geothermal heat flux] promotes basal ice melting. The moderately high GHF anomaly (>70 mW/m2 and possibly >90 mW/m2), where intensive ice melting may occur, extends inland below the ice sheet, and its western and northern boundaries cannot be established with the present data coverage on the Moho depth.”
“In East Greenland this anomalous belt merges with a strong GHF anomaly of >100 mW/m2 in the Fjordland region. The anomaly is associated with a strong lithosphere thinning, possibly to the Moho, that requires advective heat transfer such as above active magma chambers, which would accelerate ice basal melting. The anomaly may extend 500 km inland with possibly a significant contribution of ice melt to the ice-drainage system of Greenland.”
“The present results also show a huge temperature anomaly in the upper mantle of central-east Greenland (Domain 3) with the amplitude of ca. 800–1000 °C with respect to the cratonic stations. Such a temperature anomaly cannot be explained by conductive nor radiogenic mechanisms.”
“A high heat flux from the Earth’s interior enhanced by a hot fluid percolation above active magma chambers at the edge of the ice cap may have dramatic consequences for ice basal melting in the central-eastern Greenland, and may be an important contributor to the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream in Central Greenland.”

"Since late last year, a group of workers within Amazon have been organizing to push the company to radically reduce its carbon emissions. Yesterday, they announced a major new action: on 20 September, Amazon workers around the world will walk out of their offices to join the Global Climate Strike. So far, more than 1,000 workers have pledged to participate. The organizers have three demands. They want the company to commit to zero emissions by 2030, to have zero custom cloud computing contracts with fossil fuel companies and to spend zero dollars on funding climate-denying lobbyists and politicians.  I spoke to one of the walkout’s organizers, a 28-year-old Amazon employee in Seattle named Rebecca Sheppard. We spoke about the origins of climate organizing within Amazon, the goals of the walkout and how the campaign connects to the wider tech worker movement. What do you do at Amazon? I’m a senior product manager for Amazon Air. I work out of the Seattle headquarters, and I’ve been here for nearly three years.  What is Amazon Air? In 2013, Amazon had an issue with third-party carriers getting packages to people’s homes in time for Christmas. So the company began building its own cargo airline, Amazon Air. We currently have 40 airplanes, and the plan is to expand to 70 by 2021. When I first started, I worked on optimization. If you utilize each aircraft fully, you don’t need to fly as many. But eventually I became frustrated, because no matter how efficiently you’re using the aircraft, the aircraft itself remains the same. It’s still burning fossil fuels. Planes today are still unsustainable even if you’re trying to use them as efficiently as possible. And sustainability is a very personal issue for me. How so? I grew up in Wilmington, North Carolina. It’s a coastal town so I’ve been watching hurricanes roll in my whole life. My very first driving lesson my dad had me drive through a hurricane. I grew up acutely aware of the climate crisis, because I watched the hurricanes in my hometown get worse. How did you decide to take action on climate within Amazon? Last year, I was feeling hopeless, unmotivated and frankly ashamed of the role I was playing at Amazon Air enabling carbon emissions. I have a beautiful three-year-old nephew, and I was afraid of what his world was going to look like in 50 years, given how much worse it had gotten in my 28 years. Then I heard about the shareholder resolution for Amazon to take climate action. In late 2018, a group of Amazon employees announced they would bring a resolution to the next shareholder meeting that would commit the company to develop a plan for transitioning off of fossil fuels. As employees, they had received equity in Amazon, so they had a right to submit a resolution as shareholders. This is the group that became Amazon Employees for Climate Justice (AECJ). When I heard about the resolution, I was inspired.  What was the response from management to the announcement of the resolution? AECJ members met with Amazon leadership in early 2019. At the first meeting, employees asked leadership when Amazon was going to publicly commit to reduce its emissions and share its carbon footprint. They said they had no plans to do either of those things. That’s when AECJ began drafting the first version of our open letter to Jeff Bezos. The week after leadership found out this letter was being circulated internally, Amazon announced Shipment Zero, our company’s first ever commitment to reduce shipping emissions. This was a total U-turn, and it was clearly done in response to our letter. The very next day, management asked AECJ to withdraw our shareholder resolution because of Shipment Zero. Shipment Zero commits Amazon to making 50% of its shipments net zero carbon by 2030. Shipment Zero only applies to the emissions associated with delivering packages, not with the many data centers run by Amazon Web Services (AWS). In the very same week that Amazon announced Shipment Zero, we learned from an investigative piece at Gizmodo that AWS is creating custom solutions and entering into custom contracts with oil and gas companies to use our cloud services to identify new fossil fuel reserves and to facilitate faster extraction. In other words, management told us they cared about the climate at the exact same time as they were doing deals with the fossil fuel industry. Because of this, we refused to withdraw the resolution. Instead, we updated our open letter to Bezos to include commentary on the oil and gas contracts, and urged him to take action on the issues outlined in the resolution. We released this letter publicly in April 2019, and so far over 8,300 Amazon workers have signed it. In May 2019, AECJ members brought the climate plan resolution to the annual shareholders meeting in Seattle. The resolution did not receive enough votes to pass, but AECJ members delivered a speech at the meeting and held a press conference. Tell me about that experience. All of us stood up while our coworker from AECJ presented our resolution. She addressed Bezos directly and asked him to come onstage, which he declined to do. She read our request for Amazon to commit to a carbon plan and to release its carbon footprint. Then she asked everyone who supported the resolution to stand up with us. Almost everyone in the room did, not just the Amazon employees. It was a very emotional moment in what is typically a very unemotional space. Yesterday, AECJ publicly announced the next step in its campaign: a walkout by Amazon employees all over the world to join the youth-led global climate strike on 20 September. How did you put this action together? As soon as Greta Thunberg called for a global climate strike, AECJ members wanted to know how we could help. We also needed to escalate our campaign. We’ve been seeing management listen but we haven’t seen management understand. They’re not giving us concrete commitments. They’re not feeling the urgency. Why do a walkout? Why did you choose this tactic? Walking out is a symbol of employees coming together. It’s also a way of celebrating how large AECJ has become, and signaling to management and to one another that this has gone on for too long. That business as usual is not cutting it. The response so far has been incredible. Since we first announced the walkout internally last Wednesday, over 1,000 Amazon employees have pledged to walk out. And the number is growing fast. You said that systemic change requires collective action. How does the walkout demonstrate that idea? A lot of people don’t realize the strength they can wield in their workplace. I certainly didn’t. Amazon is not Jeff Bezos alone. Amazon is Amazon because of the workers who work for it. It needs all of us to function, from the people in the offices writing software to the people in the warehouses packing boxes. When you realize that, you realize the power is not at the top. It’s at the bottom, collectively, with all of the people working together to keep the company running. The statement that AECJ released yesterday to announce the walkout puts forward three climate demands for Amazon. Let’s start with the first one: you want the company to commit to zero emissions by 2030. This is our number one request. The scientific consensus is that we need to cut global emissions to net zero by 2050 to limit global temperature rise to 1.5C. But in the US and global north, we need to cut our emissions even faster. Why? Because we have been polluting more than our fair share and we have a responsibility to take more aggressive action. We also have the resources to develop the new technologies that will be needed to facilitate the transition and to make such technologies readily accessible around the world.  Your second demand is for zero custom AWS contracts for fossil fuel companies. Scientists have told us that the amount of oil and gas that we can safely continue to extract is zero. The fact that Amazon is not only using these fuels but partnering with companies to help them accelerate extraction and find new sources of oil is really alarming. And your third demand is for the company to stop funding politicians and lobbyists who deny the science on climate change. I was shocked to learn that Amazon funds climate denial. The most egregious example is the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), a thinktank that has long challenged climate science. Moreover, Amazon donated to 68 members of Congress in 2018 who voted against climate legislation 100% of the time. Climate isn’t the only issue that Amazon workers are organizing around. Since last year, workers have been pushing the company to stop selling AWS services to Palantir and other firms who enable US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), as well as to stop selling facial recognition software to law enforcement – a campaign now known internally as We Won’t Build It. Meanwhile, workers at Amazon warehouses in Minnesota have conducted three different strikes for better working conditions this year. What is the relationship between these actions and the work that AECJ is doing? All of these fights are connected. I have a lot of respect for the We Won’t Build It campaign – I proudly wear its pin to work. And I have an immense amount of respect for the Minnesota workers. When the workers at the Shakopee, Minnesota, fulfillment center announced they would be striking on Prime Day, AECJ gathered statements of solidarity from Amazon employees in corporate offices around the world. AECJ members then brought these statements to Shakopee personally to show their support. If we didn’t have fulfillment workers, then I couldn’t do my job. Our work is completely dependent on theirs. And it takes a whole lot more bravery for them to speak up than it does for people like me. What about the relationship of the AECJ to the wider tech worker movement that has emerged over the past year or two? Tech workers at a number of companies are organizing to oppose contracts with Ice and US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) under the banner of #TechWontBuildIt. Last year at Google, workers forced management to cancel its contract with the Pentagon for Project Maven, a program that uses machine learning to improve targeting for drone strikes. Then came the Google walkout, a global work stoppage by 20,000 Googlers to protest sexism and discrimination in the workplace. How does AECJ and your upcoming walkout fit into this broader picture? I’ve been incredibly inspired by the Google walkout and the #TechWontBuildIt campaigns. It’s like there’s been an awakening. Previously, people might’ve been comfortable looking the other way or putting their head in the sand. Not anymore. More and more people are standing up and saying: “This isn’t right.” And if one person says that, and then finds someone else who agrees with them, that’s all you need to start a movement. When I hear about actions at other tech companies, I’m inspired. It’s a reminder that we have power. And that our power comes from standing together in solidarity. Moral fortitude is contagious. When you see workers at other companies taking a stand, you want to take a stand yourself. If other tech workers are reading this conversation, what would you say to them? How would you persuade them to get involved? Being a tech worker doesn’t insulate you from climate impacts. The fulfillment workers in Minnesota are striking for bathroom breaks. We’re not asking for bathroom breaks because yes, we have bathroom breaks. Actually, most of us love our jobs. What we’re asking for is a future. Last year, I lived on Bainbridge Island outside of Seattle. I would take a ferry into work every morning. And at one point, the wildfires were so bad I couldn’t breathe. Everyone was wearing face masks. That isn’t the world I want to live in, where we’ve poisoned the air so badly that it poisons us. I remember learning about global warming in school. I remember thinking that all these problems would be fixed by the time I graduated from college because we have leaders. I grew up waiting for them to fix this. They didn’t. Then I changed how I thought about who leaders are. Greta Thunberg is a leader. The over 8,300 Amazon workers who signed the open letter to Bezos, those are leaders. Those of us who are walking out of our offices on 20 September, we are leaders."

Share this...FacebookTwitterRecently many readers may have noticed how alarmists and activists have been using the so-called stripe chart (see following chart) to illustrate the warming the planet has recently experienced.
The popular stripe chart was created by “lead scientist” Ed Hawkins of the National Centre for Atmospheric Science, University of Reading, NCAS, UoR.

Source here.
Pretty colors sway dimwitted alarmists
The stripe chart depicts the global temperature trend, but only since 1850, and is designed of course to make the recent warming look dramatic through the use of darkening fire red stripes on the right side.
But note that the real temperature difference between dark blue and dark red is ONLY about 1°C!
Naturally a regular, boring old line curve is all one needs, but it just doesn’t produce the dramatic panic reaction propagandists love to see from their gullible followers.

For the very easily duped masses among us, who skipped too much school and whose low intellect allow them to be easily swayed by pretty colors, the red stripes of the present are all it takes to mislead and create the desired panic.
The colored 150-year stripe chart is a classic propaganda tool for brainwashing the many dimwitted among us.
2000-year stripe chart
If colors work well to drive home a point, then let’s use them to illustrate global temperature trends going back 2000 years. So, what happens when we create a stripe chart going back 2000 years:

The above rough stripe chart is based on R.W. Spencer 2007, going back 2000 years. Clearly we see the long Medieval Warm Period in the middle and today’s warm spell on the right side.
Suddenly all the drama disappears and the propaganda is exposed for what it is. Today’s warming is in reality nothing new.
So the next time someone shows you this cherry-picked, only back to 1850, propaganda stripe chart, then show them what it looks like going back 2000 years. Imagine what a stripe chart of the entire Holocene would look like. Be my guest. I’d be happy to post it.
Note that the 2000-year one I created above is rough only. You’re welcome to improve on it.

AMO cycle on the downward side: Red Sea to cool in the coming decades
By Die kalte Sonne
(German text translated by P Gosselin)
Seven years ago, in our book “The Forgotten Sun”, we proposed using ocean cycles for medium-term forecasts. At the time, the climate establishment was strictly opposed to this. Today fortunately times have changed.
On March 15, 2019, a team led by George Krokos analyzed the temperature development of the Red Sea in Geophysical Research Letters, which has become noticeably warmer in recent decades. The researchers put this into a long-term context and found a strong correlation with the 70-year ocean cycle of the AMO (Atlantic Multidecade Oscillation).
Now that AMO has reached its peak, Krokos and colleagues expect the Red Sea to cool in the next three decades. Abstract:
Natural Climate Oscillations may Counteract Red Sea Warming Over the Coming Decades
Recent reports of warming trends in the Red Sea raise concerns about the response of the basin’s fragile ecosystem under an increasingly warming climate. Using a variety of available Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data sets, we investigate the evolution of Red Sea SST in relation to natural climate variability. Analysis of long‐term SST data sets reveals a sequence of alternating positive and negative trends, with similar amplitudes and a periodicity of nearly 70 years associated with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. High warming rates reported recently appear to be a combined effect of global warming and a positive phase of natural SST oscillations. Over the next decades, the SST trend in the Red Sea purely related to global warming is expected to be counteracted by the cooling Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation phase. Regardless of the current positive trends, projections incorporating long‐term natural oscillations suggest a possible decreasing effect on SST in the near future.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn a controversial interview, German doctor Wolfgang Wodarg – now Germany’s science public enemy No. 1 – called the response to the COVID-19 virus by governments and health authorities “a crime against humanity” and that they be put on the dock for “negligent homicide”.
Using panic to extort the public… lobbyists for the pharmaceutical industry… the scandal of hydroxychloroquine and the WHO…the dangers of a half-baked vaccine…panicking people into accepting vaccinations, surveillance and restrictions.

The video, released on May 31st dubbed “A Crime Against Humanity“, has been viewed already 150,000 times and delivers a dramatic message that the German media-political monopoly do not want to hear: Hysteria, corruption, and gross negligence surround the COVID-19 crisis.
Robbed freedom by causing a panic
The 73-year old Wodarg first says that the COVID-19 bug was no worse than any other bad flu and that officials created panic among the citizens by using the results of a faulty test, thus robbing them of their freedom.
He accuses Germany’s Minister of Health Jens Spahn of being a lobbyist who collects data for the pharmaceutical industry and being corrupt. Wodarg also warns the public of tracking apps: “They want to extort you. They want to extort you to go along, to be afraid so that you accept being vaccinated. We are being told that this vaccine could save us. This a vaccine that has been rapidly and shoddily thrown together,” he says.
Dangerous vaccination proposals
Dr. Wodarg explains how it takes at least 5 years to produce a trustworthy vaccine and warns of the untold risks of something rushed onto the market.
“Now they want to vaccinate billions of people; it’s fully irresponsible to do that with such a vaccine. I can only say don’t let your children be vaccinated; don’t let yourself be vaccinated with such a negligently manufactured, rushed vaccine. It’s only to make money, and the money making works only because we are being extorted by the media and policy making through fear. It’s like mafia protection money.”

Dr. Wodarg also explains another grisly aspect of the COVID-19 pandemic, which he calls “a crime against humanity”: a well known drug for treating malaria, Wodarg said: “Suddenly all over the world, hydroxychloroquine was recommended. It was even given away for free by Bayer.” But with the drug comes lethal affects for people who come from tropical areas and thus have “an enzyme defect”, Wodarg explains. Many people from Africa have this enzyme characteristic, people from Brazil, Central America, but also people from the Mediterranean countries, says Wodarg.
When these people are administered the recommended dosage, then after two days they are unable to get air. And if you continue to give it to them, then they die. Every medical student knows this! And a doctor who uses this drug without checking for the enzyme is acting with gross negligence.”
Malpractice “borders on genocide”
He adds it doesn’t surprise him that people are dying. Wodarg cites a recent study where data from 96,000 patients infected by COVID-19 from 671 hospitals were examined. Of the large number who were treated with hydroxychloroquine, 30% to 40% more died. And when one looks at the black and Hispanic people, then over 50% more died. “That means they are the ones who were killed by the stuff, and what happened there borders on genocide. I think what happened here is gross negligence.”
“Case for prosecutors”
Wodarg points the finger at the WHO, suspecting that a certain number of people were to die in order to create fear: “…so that fear is generated in Africa, in Brazil, so that we take the illness seriously and say: oh, it’s really bad, and we urgently need the vaccine. That’s insidious; it’s diabolical what’s taking place here. This is not a case for immunologist, but for prosecutors!”
The former German health official says every medical student learns about hydroxychloroquine in the fourth semester.
On whether there is a way out of the mess, Wodarg comments:
We have to file a lawsuit, that it’s negligent homicide, at least this is happening internationally. I don’t know if there is a prosecutor in Geneva who would go to the WHO and say: ‘Stop, halt! The files please. I want to see them. Did you know it? Did you deal with that? Why not? You’re supposed to know this. You’re doctors after all.’ And this should apply to the health services.”
Black lives don’t matter: “going to kill 20 – 30%” in Africa 
Wodarg calls what’s happening with the use of hydroxychloroquine in tropical countries a “catastrophe”.
“They know they are going to kill 20 to 30% of the people with it.”

"Barnacle geese are shifting their migratory patterns northward in response to global heating, new research has found, in a stark indication of how wildlife is being affected by the changes in climate. In their spring journey from the UK to their breeding grounds on Svalbard, one population of the geese has been forsaking a traditional feeding stop in Norway’s Helgeland, south of the Arctic circle, in favour of a stop further north in Vesterålen, far into the Arctic circle. The move has happened as spring has come earlier to the region. Over the period studied, from 1975 to 2017, the onset of grass growth in Vesterålen has come sooner by about half a day each year, making a big difference in the availability of food for the birds. Significantly, younger birds have been quicker to make the switch. The study follows other research which has found bird species migrating earlier, land-based wildlife moving their habitats, and fish shifting polewards in response to climate change.  This is the first to show migratory animals learning new routes, with individuals changing from old migration routes that they learned earlier in life in favour of the new routes, which are then transmitted to others – for instance, by offspring following their parents. The study, published in Global Change Biology, analysed 45 years of observations by the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research, the University of St Andrews in Scotland, the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, BirdLife Norway and the British Waterfowl and Wetlands Trust. In the case of these geese, the effects of the change appear to have been mostly benign, as the amount of digestible biomass available for them increased and the population studied roughly doubled in size in the past quarter century. However, the shift has opened them up to an unexpected new danger from climate change: predation from polar bears, which have started to rely on eating bird eggs now that the ice floes from which they used to hunt seals are disappearing. “[The geese] have an amazing capacity to react to climate change, and actually adjusted very fast,” said Thomas Oudman, of the school of biology at St Andrews, co-author of the study. “This was only possible because alternative feeding areas have become available, also because of climate change. For many other species, this might not be the case, [so] climate change might threaten their existence. Other migratory animals, particularly less social ones, may be less capable of finding and colonising newly available areas.” Many other birds, for instance, have few or no viable alternative areas to visit, he noted, or may find it harder to transmit new routes to offspring. “There are many bird [species] that appear to be in trouble,” he told the Guardian. “That’s why we are trying to find out how birds develop their migratory behaviour, and how changes come about. We have found a clue in geese, showing that they can change routes during their life, especially young geese. But this change is probably speeded up by the fact that geese travel in groups. This points at the possibility that individually migrating birds are generally more vulnerable to climate change, especially those that rely on very specific feeding areas, such as many shorebirds that rely on intertidal areas.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterHigh-profile Swiss meteorologist Jörg Kachelmann has penned a stinging commentary in the online Bayerischer Kurier concerning all the climate doomsday hysteria sweeping across Europe, and warns history tells us such hysteria has never turned out well.

PIK’s “silly” science, doomsday prophets
The veteran meteorologist, who is convinced the planet is indeed warming due to man’s activities, worries that environmental groups have been getting away with falsehoods and how the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) is promoting “silly” science and “view themselves as the prophets of the imminent end of the world.”
One problem with all the über-alarmism, Kachelmann sees, is a tendency of people simply resigning because they’ve come to believe that nothing can be done to stop the coming doomsday, and so why bother trying.
He also sharply criticizes green activists who blame every extreme weather event on man-made climate change, writing that it is “desperate and scientifically completely wrong”.

Future scenarios as the present – bigger media bang!
One reason the activists have become so shrill, Kachelmann believes, is due in large part to the media’s willingness to run with every sensational story without an inkling of background checking.
“Since votes are to be won now, scientifically quite justifiable predictions for the future are quickly changed into the present, because there’s a bigger bang. The charlatans are certain that this mischief will spread through the media at a time when most German states have largely abolished science education.”
“Whoring for clicks”…”bullshit sells”
“The collective disinformation unscientists meet up with a sad media situation, where the successful whoring for clicks is more important than even the smallest quantities of respectability. Stupid clicks well, says Kachelmann. “But that doesn’t matter to “Focus”, “Merkur” or the “Süddeutsche” [publications]. It still gets written because bullshit sells.”
Woodstoves, not cars, are worst polluters
Another hot issue in Germany is fine particle pollution. Here Kachelmann also sees policymakers stampeding down the wrong solution path, and are falsely putting most of the blame on automobiles: “The exceedance of fine particles and other pollutants is almost exclusively due not to traffic, but to wood-burning stoves, which have recently multiplied in densely populated areas, because insane people claim that they are “ecological.”
Over the recent years the German government has been turning a blind eye to dirty wood-burning stoves – even supporting their use. Now towns and villages across Germany are filled with choking smoke from the supposedly climate-friendly burning of wood.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSurprisingly accurate nautical maps created the 17th to 19th centuries strongly suggest coastal land area in both hemispheres were quite similar to today’s. There is even evidence relative sea levels were higher than now back then.

Image Source: Etsy.com
Globally, coasts have grown since the 1980s
Between 1985 and 2015, satellite observations indicate the world’s coasts gained 13,565 km²  more land area than they had lost to the seas (Donchyts et al., 2016).
This means more coastal land area is above sea level today than in the 1980s.
This surprises scientists, as they “expected the coast would start to retreat due to sea level rise,” but instead they observed “coasts are growing all over the world.”

Image Source(s): Donchyts et al., 2016 and BBC (press release)
Duvat (2019) also identified a global trend in island shoreline net growth since the 1980s despite recent sea level rise, as none of the globe’s islands larger than 10 ha – and just 1.2% of the 334 islands larger than 5 ha – have decreased in size since the 1980s.
These recent trends would appear to be the opposite of what would be expected with modern global warming.
Are relative sea levels lower now than during the 1800s?

As the climate warms and glaciers and ice sheets melt, it’s assumed coasts should be much smaller today than they were during the much colder and more glaciated Little Ice Age (1400-1900 A.D.).
But shorelines are not clearly smaller today according to highly detailed maps dated to the 17th to 19th centuries.
Below are 4 examples of direct comparisons between today’s Google Maps images of islands and maps from 1802, 1873, 1893, and even 1640. Each suggest there may have been slightly more land area underwater during the Little Ice Age than today.
1. An 1893 nautical map of the UK’s Isle of Man shows there was more land area underwater in 1893 than in 2019.

2. Here is an 1802 nautical map of New York City and Long Island. There may have been more open waters in this region during the Little Ice Age than in 2019.

3. A 1640 Dutch map of Taiwan shows this land area was no larger than it is today during the Little Ice Age. It even seems small nearby islands were further underwater 380 years ago than they are now.

4. An 1873 nautical map of Tasmania shows similar-sized to smaller coastal land area nearly 150 years ago when compared to images from today.

Share this...FacebookTwitterOur skeptic in Japan…
Many readers have surely read articles by Japanese blogger/contributor Kirye here at NoTricksZone since about a year and a half.

Japanese climate blogger Kirye thinks Japan will be the last developed country to ever question climate change.
Kirye, who wishes to remain anonymous, lives in Tokyo and has answered some questions about her blogging and climate science in Japan.
Interview
When and how did you become a skeptic?
It started back in 2013, I think. I read Dr. Kiyohiko Ikeda‘s books, and what he said was a surprise to me. So I started reading other books about climate change, like Svensmark’s “Chilling Stars”. It wasn’t long before I realized that we weren’t being told the whole truth about climate.
Are you a scientist or an expert?
Of course not. I’m just a layperson, like many other bloggers, who happened to notice some things were not making any sense. I got interested in it and realized that there are many serious scientists who have very different views. The main media in Japan never tell us that. In fact, they are ignoring the record cold in North America right now. As a writer, I feel we need journalists who actually do the job of investigating.
Are many people in Japan skeptical about climate science?
I don’t like the expression ‘skeptics’. They are in fact climate realists. If the question is: Are there many climatic realists in Japan, then I would answer as follows: Unfortunately not. Most people simply believe what they are told by the media. Japan is rather culturally and media isolated. Many people here do not understand English well enough to read dissenting material from abroad. The information they receive gets filtered beforehand. It’s not like in the US, or Britain, where people get to hear both sides.
When do you think people in Japan will become more skeptical about climate science?

Not in the foreseeable future, I think. As I said, Japanese people are rather isolated from the outside world, and so rely on the mainstream media for their information. There are some very good realist scientists in Japan, but they are shut out by the media. Climate realism will reach Japan only after alarmism ends in US and Europe.
The planet has warmed over the past century. What’s behind it?
I’m not a scientist, just a layman. Nobody really knows. We only know that there are many different scientists with many different explanations – many having to do with the natural oceanic and solar cycles, and not CO2. Well, I agree with Dr. Lindzen’s opinion. And as you can see from past posts, I even checked the Japanese countryside stations. Many of them have not warmed for about 20 or more years.
Much of the manmade component is probably the urban heat island effect and poor land use.
What are the most convincing facts that tell us there’s no alarm?
That’s easy to answer. Just look at the temperature of the Holocene. It was often much warmer than it is today over the past 10,000 years. The temperature of the last 30 years is nothing unusual. What’s 30 years compared to the last 10,000?
Also typhoons, hurricanes etc. show in fact a downward trend. And the tide gauges at coastlines show no alarming story.
And if you haven’t noticed, the science is so politicized.
Why do you check temperature data?
I simply believe in searching for the truth. I can’t stand it when honest scientists who are simply trying to get to the truth get attacked and hurt. Some scientists say it’s all trace gas CO2. I can’t overlook such absurdity.
So, I think laymen have to do journalism now because major media have abandoned journalism in Japan. This world is far from perfect, but we can work to make it better.
Fortunately, I can check the data and present the results with charts. I will keep doing this.

"Leaked communications suggest that the UN’s migration agency is censoring itself on the climate crisis and the global compact on migration, following pressure from the US government. An email sent by a US-based official of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) on 28 August to colleagues around the world relayed that the US state department’s Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration (PRM) told the agency documents related to programme activities it funds “must not be in conflict with current [US government] political sensitivities”.  Sensitivities include the climate crisis, sustainable development goals, the global compact for migration and “anything that seems at odds with the administration’s take on US domestic/foreign issues”, the official wrote in the email. “Documents related to programme activities, especially those that will be published online, may require prior review and approval by the donor,” they went on, requesting that colleagues use “discretion” and share relevant documents “in enough time to make any necessary adjustments in coordination with PRM”. The email’s author noted that “PRM is very willing to cut funding in areas that it deems are not in line with US foreign policy objectives”, and asked that the substance of the email be conveyed by regional coordinators “to all country focal points”. The Guardian understands from IOM sources and further communications it has seen that the agency is avoiding direct references to climate change in documents for projects funded by other US government entities such as USAid. IOM receives about a quarter of its total budget of $2bn (£1.6bn) from the US, $18m of which is provided by PRM. There is no indication that messaging on projects funded by other donors will be censored, or that there will be any operational impact on existing programmes. However, a source in the humanitarian community in the US who had recently left IOM, told the Guardian he was “very concerned … that IOM is acquiescing to this kind of pressure”. “I’ve seen a response [to the email] from at least one regional official who explicitly asked staff not to directly refer to climate change or the global compact on migration in a range of reports or proposals that would be sent to the US government,” he said. “While I understand that IOM are simply doing what they think is strategically necessary to protect funding for important projects, senior officials should be mindful of the fact that there’s a slippery slope here,” he continued. Jeff Crisp, a research associate at Oxford University’s Refugee Studies Centre who previously held a senior position in the UN’s refugee agency UNHCR, said the leaked message “raises some serious questions about the autonomy of IOM, its sensitivity to positions adopted by the US administration, and its ability to function as a member of the UN system”. Akshaya Kumar, director of crisis advocacy at Human Rights Watch, said: “Confronting climate change may very well be the issue that defines our time. Agencies in the UN family shouldn’t be towing the Trump party line.” Tensions between the US and IOM have simmered over the past year, when Ken Isaacs, the proposed US candidate to head the agency, became the first American since the 1960s to be rejected as its top official, prompting concerns that funding from the state department could be cut. Press reports at the time revealed that Isaacs had made comments online expressing doubts over the evidence for climate change, suggesting it was a “hoax”. President Trump himself has expressed doubts about the effects and causes of climate change, while the US objected to the global compact on migration, describing it as a “pro-migration” agreement and an “effort by the United Nations to advance global governance at the expense of the sovereign right of states”. Leonard Doyle, IOM’s head of communications, said: “IOM recognises and respects the priorities and limitations of its donors, including the US. We seek to ensure that staff are aware of such sensitivities when drafting funding proposals for activities which are a response to migration trends and which follow best practice.” A US state department spokesperson said: “IOM is an important partner for the United States around the globe. The US government supports organisations such as IOM, to conduct programmes and activities that are consistent with our foreign policy goals and objectives.” • This article was amended on 11 September 2019. The International Organization for Migration is the UN’s migration agency, not its refugee agency as an earlier version said."
"It has been described by scientists as “the greatest orgy in the world”; an annual gamete-fest, where entire colonies of coral reefs release their sperm and eggs simultaneously in a slick on the ocean surface that has been seen from space. But now scientists fear the climate crisis may be disrupting the ability of corals to synchronise this marine phenomenon, threatening them with extinction. A Tel Aviv university study, published in Science, has found the release of eggs and sperm in certain reef-building corals in the Gulf of Eilat in the Red Sea have changed over time and have lost their synchronicity. For a coral, reliant on a chance encounter, timing is everything. But researchers have found some are spawning “out of tune” with normal patterns, with the result that fewer baby corals are forming.  “Coral spawning … is one of the greatest examples of synchronised phenomena in nature,” said Professor Yossi Loya, of the university’s School of Zoology. “Once a year, thousands of corals along hundreds of kilometres of a coral reef release their eggs and sperm simultaneously into the open water, where fertilisation will later take place. Since both the eggs and the sperm of corals can persist only a few hours in the water, the timing of this event is critical.” Although visually, the coral reefs seemed healthy, the corals suffering a breakdown in spawning synchrony produced fewer baby corals, creating circumstances for extinction. While it is not yet fully understood exactly how spawning synchrony works, scientists say it relies on environmental cues, including sea temperature, solar irradiance, wind, the phase of the moon and the time of sunset. The researchers began monitoring corals in the Gulf of Eilat in 2015 and, over four years, recorded the number of spawning individuals during the annual coral reproductive season, between June and September. They compared spawning timings of five coral species between 2015 and 2018 to results from two other studies conducted on the same species in the 1980s.  “We found that, in some of the most abundant coral species, the spawning synchrony had become erratic, contrasting both the widely accepted paradigm of highly synchronous coral spawning and studies performed on the exact same reefs decades ago,” said Tom Shlesinger, a PhD student and co-author of the study. To find out whether this failure in spawning synchrony translated into reproductive failure, they mapped thousands of corals within permanent reef plots, revisiting the plots every year to see how many corals of a given species had died, compared to new juveniles. “Although it appeared that the overall state of the coral reefs at Eilat was quite good and every year we found many new corals recruiting to the reefs, for those species that are suffering from the breakdown in spawning synchrony, there was a clear lack of recruitment of new juvenile generations, meaning that some species that currently appear to be abundant may actually be nearing extinction through reproductive failure,” said Shlesinger. It is not yet known what was causing the loss of synchrony. However, the researchers found temperature had a “strong influence” on coral reproductive cycles. In the study region, temperatures are rising “fast”, at rate of 0.31C a decade. Another plausible cause could be endocrine or hormonal disrupting pollutants, accumulating in marine environments, they said. The study was based on five corals; however, the researchers believe their findings could be a warning to other species. “Regardless of the exact cause leading to these declines in spawning synchrony, our findings serve as a timely wake-up call to start considering these subtler challenges to coral survival, which are very likely also impacting additional species in other regions,” said Shlesinger. “On a positive note, identifying early warning signs of such reproductive mismatches will contribute to directing our future research and conservation efforts toward the very species that are at potential risk of decline, long before they even display any visible signs of stress or mortality.”"
"Eight protesters are to go on trial in Paris on Wednesday for stealing official portraits of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, from public buildings as part of a protest over climate change. The activists, aged 23 to 36, have been charged with theft after taking down the pictures from local government offices around the capital in February.  The acts of civil disobedience were part of a movement called Take Down Macron, which was intended to highlight alleged inaction by the French government over the global crisis. The group behind it, Non-Violent Action COP21 (ANV-COP21), claims that 128 portraits have been stolen across France, while 57 people face “group theft” charges that carry a maximum five-year jail term. Several hundred protesters held up the portraits during a protest in south-western France at the end of August near Biarritz, where Macron was hosting a G7 summit of world leaders. “Solidarity with the people who took down the portraits of our presidential monarch,” leftwing political leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon tweeted on Tuesday.  Cécile Duflot, the head of campaign group Oxfam in France, also backed the protesters, writing: “It’s a symbolic action and not a group theft.” All public schools and government offices display the president’s portrait, with Macron’s showing him perched on the edge of his desk with two mobile phones and the memoirs of French resistance hero and post-war president Charles de Gaulle behind him. It is not the first time the picture of the 41-year-old leader has been targeted. In October 2017, mayors in the central Creuse region turned Macron’s picture round so that he faced the wall, in protest at cuts to local government budgets and job losses. The first trial over the thefts of presidential portraits took place at the end of May in the eastern town of Bourg-en-Bresse. An environmental campaigner was fined €250 (£222) and five others received suspended fines."

Share this...FacebookTwitterA commentary titled “‘Just don’t panic – also about climate change’” by Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt appearing at German site achgut.com tells us there’s no need for panic with respect to climate change, as leading scientists dial back earlier doomsday projections.

Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt. Image: GWPF
No warming until 2050
Vahrenholt claims a negative Atlantic oscillation is ahead of us and the expected second weak solar cycle in succession will reduce anthropogenic warming in the next 15-30 years. He cites a recent publication by Judith Curry, who sees a pause in the temperature rise until 2050 as the most likely scenario.
Vahrenholt and Curry are not alone when it comes to believing a natural-variability-watered-down warming is in the works. Also IPCC heavyweight Jochem Marotzke from the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg takes a similar stand in a publication in the Environmental Research Letters.
In the paper Marotzke concludes that all locations examined show “a cooling trend or lack of warming trend”and that there is “no warming due to natural cooling effects” and that in calculations up to 2049. The researchers find “a large part of the earth will not warm up because of internal variability”.
Distancing from alarmists Schellnhuber, Rahmstorf
And recently The Max Planck Institute Director Marotzke said in an interview with Andreas Frey of the Frankfurter Allgemeinen Zeitung (FAZ) that there was no need to panic, thus clearly splitting from the doomsday scenarios put out by his alarmist colleagues Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber and Stefan Rahmstorf.

//-->




In the FAZ interview, Marotzke also said there was no need to worry that the port city of Hamburg would be flooded in 2100: “Hamburg will not be threatened, that is totally clear.”
Areas not going to be wiped out
Marotzke then told the FAZ that the fears that children have today for the future are not absolutely well founded, and that entire areas are not going to be wiped out, as often often suggested by alarmists.
Sensational French models
When asked why the French issued a press release warning of worse than expected warming, Marotzke said: “We thought, my God, what are you doing? Because it is very unlikely that the true climate is as sensitive as shown in the new models.”
When asked by the FAZ why the French had put out such dramatic numbers, Marotzke said: “I don’t know,” adding that the climate models are highly complex. “Too many calculation steps overlap, and sometimes we ourselves are amazed at what we do not understand“.
Speaking up against alarmist models
Vahrenholt summarizes the growing doubt by scientists such as Curry and Marotzke over the use of alarmist models:
One gets the impression someone is speaking out against the alarmist use of models. Perhaps Jochem Marotzke is aware that with the warming coming to an end in the next 30 years, model alarmists (Schellnhuber: “We only have 10 years left“) will have unpleasant questions to answer. When society realizes that the climate modelers have exaggerated in order to make a political difference, we will know who misled the politicians.”

"This is an obituary for quaint slab-wood cabins, a place that was burned down on the weekend in a fire devastating for the many thousands of people who have visited over the past 85 years. Binna Burra Lodge, in the world-heritage-listed rainforest of Lamington national park, has been destroyed by bushfire.  Binna Burra was the environmental lodge started by conservationist and adventurer Arthur Groom and engineer Romeo Lahey (brother of artist Vida) in 1933 as a place for ordinary people to “experience the grandeur”. It was never luxurious, with cabins, a big fireplace in the reception lounge and access to a forest like no other. There’s still only one road in, from the Gold Coast to the ridge of Beechmont and then, a single-lane final climb through eucalyptus forest to the edge of the rainforest. Often the place is shrouded in mist. Most years, it rains a lot. I first visited Binna Burra as a high school biology student 40 years ago, staying in the dorm accommodation at the campsite across from the main lodge. I had all the attitude of a damaged teen and a firm belief that nothing could surprise or move me. And yet, here it was, this place of giant trees and different air and light that changes minute to minute. The birds, the understory, the smell of it. I can’t hope to make you understand. You’d have to go there. I do not come from a hiking family – we never once visited a national park – but that first experience began for me a lifelong love affair with this national park in particular and national parks more generally. And what a gift it has been. Like a mother, the rainforest at Binna Burra takes you in its arms. In one way or another, I have been in those arms ever since. Binna Burra Lodge’s bird-in-boots logo was possibly daggy when it was launched in the 70s, and it’s even more daggy 50 years on. I say this with all due affection, an affection I know is shared by other visitors. They will have slept in bunk rooms with shared amenities or splurged on a cabin of their own with a bathroom. They might have spent rainy days in the upstairs “library” with its yellowed books donated by guests. They’ll have enjoyed a pre-dinner drink (or cup of tea) while watching the sunset under massive gums on the terrace. They’ll have eaten the fancy boarding school food in the dining room, supplies trucked up three times a week – hash browns at breakfast, three meats and a veggie option at dinner, soup in a massive tureen on each table with fresh baked bread. More recently, they might have stayed in the self-contained skylodges, less bluestone, less timber but still with that simplicity that admits the grandeur. And they’ll have walked. They’ll have taken a packed lunch of meats and salads and bread and fruit cake on the trail. They might have gone just a little way in, to Tullawallal, rewarded by the sight of those ancient Antarctic beech trees Binna Burra is named for. Even in an hour in the rainforest, they’ve heard more birds and seen more trees than in a week in a city. They return to the lodge and the staff listen as they describe a lyrebird’s call as if they are the first person who’s ever heard it. Others may have walked more kilometres than they thought possible. Once, I went abseiling with a lodge group. We hiked out and crawled through narrow caves to drop down off the Shipstern and Turtle Rock, finishing in the evening at Natural Bridge to see the glow-worms. I’m afraid of heights and small spaces. It didn’t matter out there. In recent years, I have shied away from the lodge, preferring a campsite in the national park to a soft bed and conviviality. Perhaps I’ve wanted time alone, grieving for the world, but now, I wish I’d stayed at the lodge more often. You’d look around the dining room at night and you’d see it on the faces. It’s wonder, the experience of awe. It’s what nature gives us, a chance to be small, insignificant. At Binna Burra, you are gently encouraged to come to understand just how little you matter. And it’s a relief. The fire was swift and out of control by Friday when the lodge was evacuated. On Saturday, no one could get in to fight it. It was a black dawn for Binna Burra’s director and 70 staff on Sunday. The dining room is gone. The lodge cabins are all gone. Even the new sky lodges are devastated. Perhaps it was always written that this would happen. It has happened. A place that offered nothing but a way to help us see has been destroyed by our blindness. Now is the time, if you have breath in your body and have ever experienced Lamington national park and Binna Burra Lodge, to help them out in whatever way you can. I am hoping they will set up a support page. I will be on it as soon as they do. Because the rainforest is still there to be shared. There is something fundamentally good and unchanged about Binna Burra, as if the place itself takes over whoever happens to be in charge. Whatever rises from the ashes will be different; of course it will. But the new Binna Burra will still be the place where Antarctic beech trees grow. It can provide another generation and another with the safest arms they will ever rest in. It’s us who have a chance to do something to help make it real.

"Nearly 40% of UK greenhouse gas emissions, to use a figure architects love to bandy, are caused by the built environment. Or a bit more, depending on the definitions used. It’s an arresting figure. It suggests that the design of buildings and the planning of cities can do much to counter climate crisis.  Architects like to think of themselves as public-spirited, well-intentioned people. The profession tends to attract people who want to change the world for the better. And what could matter more than the prevention of environmental and societal collapse? It makes squabbles about architectural style or form seem trivial by comparison. So what would architecture look like – more importantly, what would it be – if all involved really and truly put climate at the centre of their concerns? Would there be no more concrete, given the material has been fingered as particularly destructive? Or an end to towers clad in panels that have to be replaced every 30 years? Or much less building altogether?  It is a question raised earlier this year by the launch of Architects Declare, in which 17 winners of the Stirling prize proclaimed a set of principles by which they and – they hoped – others would from now on work, and by the debate that followed. How serious could these architects really be, went one of the reactions, given that a number of them are designing major airports? A more radical version of the question will be put by the young curators of the Oslo Architecture Triennale, Maria Smith, Phin Harper, Cecilie Sachs Olsen and Matthew Dalziel, which opens later this month. “Just fiddling around with what the market gives us is not enough,” says Harper. What is considered sustainable differs wildly depending on who you ask. The World Green Building Council, an organisation supported by members from the construction industry, holds up the seemingly surprising example of Barangaroo, a huge high-rise development on the Sydney waterfront. Harper and Smith cite traditional earth-building techniques and ingenious experiments in building structures without cement or steel. Somewhere in between is a building like the Stirling prize-shortlisted Cork House in Eton, about which nobody has a bad word to say. The argument of Architects Declare – which might be called the sensible middle ground – goes something like this: architects (and for that matter contractors, clients, engineers and everyone else involved in making buildings) have no excuse for not giving their utmost to make their work have as little impact on the environment as possible. They have to consider everything – how far stone might have to travel from quarry to site, for example, and whether or not a building’s components will end up as landfill when it is demolished. It is not enough to reduce what are called the “in-use” costs – heating, ventilation, lighting, water, waste, maintenance – but also the “embodied energy” that goes into construction and demolition: quarrying cement, smelting steel, firing bricks, shipping materials to site, putting them in place, taking them down again and disposing of them. Until recently the construction industry has concentrated on in-use costs. The British building regulations, for example, set reasonably high standards for the performance of buildings, but are silent on embodied energy. This makes no sense – there’s little point building something that performs magnificently in use, if it takes decades or centuries to pay back the expenditure of energy that went into its construction. Painful choices may be required – giving up some dearly beloved brutalist-style concrete or a favourite brick. It might mean some genuinely difficult dilemmas: concrete, if used right, slows the rates at which a building cools down and warms up (good) but is made with cement, a material that singlehandedly accounts for about 8% of the world’s carbon dioxide emissions (not good). Sustainable design shouldn’t be seen as just a technical fix, a matter of paying the right consultant enough money to make sure the building ticks enough boxes, or of buying the most magical available piece of cooling technology. It should rather be integrated into the art of architecture. The ideal is that it should help buildings be all round better, longer-lasting, more pleasurable, more beautiful – “generosity, quality of materials, what people want – it kind of makes them endure” is how Alison Brooks, one of the Architects Declare signatories puts it. It could mean more natural stone, more timber. This is why the Cork House appeals – its material is lovely stuff, which also happens to be renewable, recyclable and highly insulating. Slightly more radically, the architectural profession needs to reconsider its value systems, what is considered good and what bad. Architects are still trained from studenthood to perform in what Steve Tompkins, one of the driving forces behind Architects Declare, calls a “competitive and individualistic profession”. They get more glory for designing a singular new building than they would if they worked out a good way of insulating old houses. Yet, as most of the building stock of the future is already with us, and as demolition and rebuilding entails the chucking away of whatever went into making the original building, the latter is likely to be more useful than the former. All of which, if every architect pursued it with full commitment, would be a significant advance. This collection of good principles, however, doesn’t answer the airport question, which highlights the limits on architects’ powers: it is not up to them to decide how much air travel there is in the world, which leaves them with the choice of refusing the commission to design airport buildings, or helping them to be as “green” as they possibly can be. Grimshaw Architects, Foster and Partners and Zaha Hadid Architects, signatories of Architects Declare, have opted for the latter. They are working on terminals in Heathrow, Mexico City and Beijing, respectively. For Jeremy Till, head of Central Saint Martins school of art and design, these architects’ choice is a “farce.” “You can’t have a carbon-neutral airport,” he says. Architects have to do more than be well-intentioned instruments of what he calls “an extractive industry.” They have to be activists as well as designers. Maria Smith and Phin Harper believe drastic times call for drastic actions. If, as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said last autumn, there were only 12 years left to limit climate change catastrophe (make that 11, as nearly a year has passed since then), the conventional processes of architecture are too slow to make any difference. By the time a well-considered, carefully calculated development has successfully traded off the inputs and outputs that went into its construction, it will be too late. Rather the whole attitude to construction has to change now. Which also requires the economic system behind it – that is to say, capitalism – to change. Their Triennale in Oslo, a series of displays and performances starting on 26 September, will apply to architecture the economic and political idea of degrowth – the beliefs that an alternative has to be found to the continuously rising GDPs that are fundamental to capitalist economies. For Smith and Harper it is about using resources that already exist and, rather than serving “utilitarian goals of investment and profit”, concentrating on “what really makes life worth living”. “All the ingredients for a good life exist somewhere in the world,” they say – it’s just a question of enabling everyone to have access to them. For architecture this might mean learning from indigenous building techniques based on using renewable materials close at hand, such as mud walls or thatch, enhanced with modern technology. Smith and Harper give as examples machines for making bricks out of mud, wall panels made of hemp and lime, materials made from compressed recycled denim or from ground-up pine needles mixed with pine resin. There is a technique for building columns by filling heavy duty fabric with sand or rubble. There is mycelium, a form of fungus that can be made into bricks. A practical example of this thinking is the Ilford community market, a project by Smith’s practice, Interrobang, which is due to open next year. Here there will be no concrete foundations, but a timber structure stabilised by rocks in metal cages that can be demounted and reassembled with minimal waste or impact. It should also be possible to make a humble kitchen extension, argue Smith and Harper, using materials dug up from the ground around it, “rather than importing steel reinforcement from China”. It would only require a different idea of what a kitchen extension should look like. There are a few gaps in the thinking articulated by Smith and Harper. If action on climate is urgent, we probably can’t wait for the entire economic and social basis of the modern construction industry to change first. It’s also not obvious how some of the experimental techniques they mention can be developed at speed and realised at sufficient scale to make a meaningful impact. They themselves don’t pretend to have all the answers. But then, it’s also clear that more moderate members of the profession don’t have all the answers, either. What is clear is that everyone involved in the design and making of buildings has to do everything they can to mitigate their effect on climate. Which, if we’re really lucky, will also lead to better architecture. Barangaroo, SydneyA large-scale commercial development that tries to modify conventional processes rather than replace them; for example, by reducing the amount of cement in concrete, or using water from an adjoining bay to help cool the towers of homes and offices. Its approach has won awards. Sandbag columnsThe Canadian architectural practice YYYY-MM-DD are developing what might be called super sandbags: structural columns made by containing sand or rubble in the type of heavy-duty fabric used for shipping construction materials. In principle, it means you could build using whatever is available on a building site, but it’s still at a speculative stage. Radical recyclingMa-tt-er, a London-based “materials research design studio”, are pushing the possibilities of natural and recycled materials – plaster made from mussel shells, floors made from seaweed, denim from old jeans compressed into a load-bearing material. MyceliumThe fungal substance that gives mushrooms their structure is now touted as both an organic substitute for plastic and a vegetarian substitute for beef. Architects are exploring its possibilities too, most conspicuously with temporary towers built outside MoMA’s PS1 gallery in New York. Engineered timberThe processing of wood such that it’s strong enough to build multistorey buildings is proof that experimental techniques can become mainstream. Engineered timber is now frequently used as an alternative to concrete, at large scales. The only snag, as the engineer Mark Skelly points out, is that there isn’t enough sustainably sourced timber in the world to make all buildings out of it. The simplest way to build green is not to build at all: existing building stock is a vast store of carbon and of resources that are lost when a building is demolished. Re-use is usually seen as less glamorous than building new, but it’s a good use of architects skills to find ways to adapt rather than replace."

"The world’s biggest producers of meat, dairy and seafood are failing to tackle the enormous impact they are having on the planet through deforestation, the routine use of antibiotics and greenhouse gas emissions, a report warns. The Coller Fairr index ranks 50 of the largest global meat, dairy and fish producers by looking at risk factors from use of antibiotics to deforestation and labour abuses. The producers are the “hidden” supply chain, providing meat and dairy to global brands including McDonald’s, Tesco, Nestlé and Walmart.  The index is written by investment experts who want to encourage awareness of the risks posed to the planet – and to their own profitability – by companies that fail to mitigate the damage done to the environment by food production. Jeremy Coller is founder of Fairr and chief investment officer at Coller Capital. He says it is the huge companies behind the brands that will themselves suffer if the planet isn’t protected. “It is the companies hidden upstream in the meat and dairy supply chain who face the most significant climate and public health risks. “As last month’s landmark report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) demonstrated, the world’s meat, fish and dairy industries are under serious threat from climate change impacts. In stark contrast to the transport sector, only one in four meat, fish and dairy producers even measure their greenhouse gas emissions, let alone act to reduce them.” Among other failings, the index says that none of the companies analysed have a comprehensive policy to stop deforestation. And just four companies in the index “have committed to phasing out routine use of antibiotics, widespread in the industry”. According to the report, two-thirds of producers do not even measure all their greenhouse gas emissions let alone set targets to reduce them. These include Hormel Foods in the US, a supplier to McDonald’s. Also included is Cal-Maine Foods. Cal-Maine is the largest producer of fresh eggs in the US and a supplier to Walmart and Nestle. Nestlé, McDonald’s and Walmart have all publicly committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. And while Walmart has previously said it wants to achieve zero net deforestation in its supply chain by 2020, the research shows that Walmart suppliers such as Cranswick in the UK have no comprehensive policy on deforestation. McDonald’s have pledged to reduce antibiotics use in their beef supply chains. But the vast majority of beef suppliers do not have a policy to avoid routine use of antibiotics. Only one – Marfrig – does. The companies are ranked according to their risk for investors, based on analysis of nine key environmental, social and governance risk factors, combined with the sustainable development goals. The Hong Kong-based WH Group were noted as “high risk” while Hormel Foods and Cranswick were designated as “medium risk”. The research argues that some of the companies, who between them have a value of $300bn (£248bn), are already suffering the costs of the deepening climate crisis. Cal-Maine Foods reported a 30% decline in revenues in the last quarter of the year alone due to extreme weather. Peter Van der Werf is an engagement specialist at investment firm Robeco, advising on how to invest sustainably. He told the Guardian that research into the environmental risks of food production is vital. “This is very important research. As investment managers we take a lot of care assessing risk – for example an analyst looking at food production needs to have a good understanding of climate change risks … like deforestation, loss of feed supply that comes through cattle grazing on depleted land, use of water.” Van der Werf says that he can see progress being made as producers are made aware of the benefit of considering environmental risks. “Companies were previously reluctant to show an interest in alternative proteins like fake meat, but we have seen a huge growth in demand. We started engagement over labour safety and use of antibiotics and over three years we have clearly seen an engagement and awareness. Now Tyson Foods, for example, has climate targets. They didn’t have that before.” He says the end aim is for producers and investors to move away from meat and fish as protein sources as much as possible. “The fires we have seen in the Amazon have come up in conversations with investors. They are concerned about climate change, about forest fires. There is a global need to further reduce reliance on meat and dairy and look at different protein choices.” A spokesman for the National Farmers’ Union told the Guardian that there is a commitment to achieving net zero carbon emissions in the UK farming industry by 2040. He said this will be achieved through improving efficiency and animal welfare, managing carbon storage on farms and boosting renewable energy. The Guardian contacted the companies named but at the time of publication had not received responses from all of them. Nestle said: “The Nestlé Responsible Sourcing Standard sets out sustainability practices that we ask our suppliers, their employees, agents and subcontractors to respect and adhere to at all times. In addition, we run a responsible sourcing program for 15 high-priority raw materials, including meat, poultry and eggs and dairy. For these materials, our work starts by mapping our supply chain all the way down to the farm or slaughterhouse. When suppliers refuse to improve, we will remove them from our supply chain.” Walmart said: “We believe that both collaborative action and traceability across our global supply chain are needed to reduce deforestation associated with the production of beef and soy in Brazil. We’re working with the Consumer Goods Forum, the Tropical Forest Alliance and the Statement of Support Group for the Cerrado Manifesto as we work toward our goal to reduce deforestation.” A Tesco spokesperson said: “Food is at the heart of our business, and our commitment to sustainable sourcing is recognised by FAIRR both in this report and its recent ‘Appetite for disruption’ report, where Tesco topped the retail ranking for our focus on sustainable protein. We set ourselves ambitious and transparent sustainability targets, including across carbon reduction, biodiversity and tackling deforestation, which we will meet through working in partnership with our suppliers.” Tyson Foods said: “We recently announced a science-based target to decrease greenhouse gas emissions 30% by 2030 as well as a partnership with Environmental Defense Fund focused on increasing sustainable farming practices on more than 2m acres of row crop corn by 2020. This is the largest commitment ever made by a US protein company, and we will be reporting on our progress over time.” Hormel said: “As a global branded food company, we take our sustainability practices very seriously. We are working toward achieving our 2020 goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and non-renewable energy use by 10% by 2020. “We are pleased to see the report highlighted our company as one of the leaders in the industry and showcased Hormel Foods for our best practices for water usage. Additionally, the report singled out Hormel Foods as being the only company that has established a sustainable agricultural policy that extends to feed-grain growers.”"
"This week started out like most weeks for Donald Trump: a Monday morning spent sending a flurry of unhinged tweets then a quick break to indulge in some offline racism. Addressing reporters on the White House lawn before heading to a campaign rally, Trump said he was keeping a close eye on the situation in the Bahamas. Particularly since the people fleeing the grim aftermath of Hurricane Dorian and trying to come to America might be dangerous drug dealers. Presumably because they are black. “The Bahamas had some tremendous problems with people going to the Bahamas that weren’t supposed to be there,” Trump said. “I don’t want to allow people that weren’t supposed to be in the Bahamas to come into the United States, including some very bad people and some very bad gang members and some very, very bad drug dealers.”  Like most things Trump says, this statement is very, very removed from reality. But who needs facts when you can appeal to racist feelings? Trump’s smearing of Hurricane Dorian survivors builds on his tried-and-tested strategy of dehumanising non-white people by describing them as “bad hombres,” rapists and MS-13 gang members. It builds on his strategy of describing any non-white person seeking refuge in America as a threat to the country. Trump’s comments, it should be noted, were prompted by a question about an incident on Sunday in which 119 Bahamian evacuees, including children, were told to get off a ferry bound for Florida because they didn’t have US visas. This came as a shock because Bahamians don’t need visas to visit America if they don’t have a police record and plan a short stay. According to an American reporter on the ferry, the evacuees he spoke to didn’t plan to move to the US, “They were coming to go grocery shopping, stay in a hotel with AC [air conditioning], chill for a little and then head back.” Nobody is entirely sure where the last-minute visa order came from. The US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency’s Florida office initially pointed the blame at Baleària, the ferry company. “It breaks my heart,” a CBP spokesman told Newsweek on Monday. “It’s like when you raise somebody’s hopes and then you pop the balloon ...That, in my opinion, is what Baleària did.” Baleària, on the other hand, has said it was advised of the documentation requirements by the CBP. Meanwhile, Trump’s acting CBP head, Mark Morgan, blamed the ferry fiasco on confusion. It is perfectly possible that nothing more insidious than administrative confusion led to those 119 Bahamians being kicked off a ferry. But Trump’s comments about “very bad people” also means it’s perfectly possible that more malicious motives were at play. No matter who is at fault, however, this episode should leave us all very unsettled. As the climate crisis progresses, there will be more climate migrants seeking temporary or permanent reprieve. They will not be met with open arms and open borders. They will be met with no legal recognition and little protection, as they won’t have refugee status. They will be met with racism. They will be met, as a UN expert recently warned, with a growing system of climate apartheid. And, if the likes of Katie Hopkins (Trump’s favourite Brit) have their way, eventually they will be met with gun boats."
"Their style could hardly be more different, though their aims are the same: as Greta Thunberg sailed into New York last week on a low-carbon high-tech yacht to highlight the climate crisis, Prince Harry faced flak for taking private jets for short-hop breaks while campaigning against global heating. But the contrast between the two reflects broader dilemmas in the environmental movement. On Tuesday, the Duke of Sussex invited further ridicule as he flew into Amsterdam – a direct Eurostar train from London takes three hours and 41 minutes – to unveil an initiative for the tourism industry, Travalyst, which aims to reduce the impact of holidaymakers but encourages travel.  Harry defended his flying record on the basis that “nobody is perfect”, and that “occasionally [there is] a unique circumstance to ensure that my family are safe”. The Guardian recently calculated, using data from the German NGO Atmosfair, that a UK citizen taking a single flight can have the same impact on the climate in a few hours as a person in one of the world’s least developed countries does in a whole year. For the prince, travel by private plane for his family is likely to generate as much as an entire village. But not everyone can solve their travel problems like Thunberg, as there is unlikely to be a transatlantic sailing boom to replace flying. Tony Juniper, one of the UK’s most prominent environmentalists who has worked with Prince Charles and now chairs Natural England, said the prince was not alone in facing green dilemmas. “Prince Harry does a great deal of good work raising awareness and helping to make progress on conservation questions,” he said. “Like anyone else, however, he has to deal with the circumstances of the real world, and the fact that we don’t yet have zero-emissions planes. Flying less is certainly a key message we all need to hear but quite a lot of environmentalists use planes to make their work possible, and in his position he often has no alternative but to fly, including for reasons of security.” The irony of encouraging tourism, despite its potential damage to pristine or struggling environments, and the emissions involved in getting to remote places, is also one that the green movement must grapple with, Juniper said. “Ecotourism is one of the ways that wildlife can be rendered worth more alive than dead, and it is something the conservation community needs to embrace as one strategy alongside others,” he said. “Take the example of Costa Rica, where deforestation has been reversed, in large part because of the economic benefits that come with tourists visiting to see the wonderful wildlife there.” The royals’ fellow feeling for other endangered creatures is certainly valued by the organisations they work with. Mark Jones, the head of policy at Born Free, which campaigns for wildlife, said: “The interest the royal family, and particularly princes William and Harry, have shown in global wildlife conservation has undoubtedly helped bring the plight of wildlife to the attention of a truly global audience, from decision-makers to the wider public. We are grateful for their interest in and support for our efforts to reverse global biodiversity loss and provide a secure future for the wildlife with which we share our world.” Greenpeace says it would like to see a frequent flyer levy, tax on aviation fuel, an end to airport expansion and most of all moves to rein in demand, because strategies such as offsetting – donating cash to programmes that reduce greenhouse gas emissions in other areas – are not enough. John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, said: “Offsetting works over an extremely long timeframe. Maybe as a way of raising money for reforestation it works, but that’s charity. We should call it what it is.” Justin Francis, a co-founder of the travel firm Responsible Travel, said: “Voluntary [offsetting] initiatives are not enough – the cost of flying must increase. Carbon offsets are no substitute for carbon reduction.” Anna Hughes, who runs the campaign group Flight Free UK, said: “The answer is simply not to fly.” Flying has expanded rapidly in recent years, partly owing to tax breaks and incentives compared with less carbon-intensive travel, and last year accounted for 2.6% of energy-related emissions. On Friday, new details of the Sussexes’ forthcoming Africa tour will be revealed by Buckingham Palace. It is believed that conservation and green issues will be among the top priorities for the couple’s first major overseas programme of engagement, as well as gender equality, education and development, where the duchess has already made a mark. The British royal family is not alone in striving to save the planet, as monarchies across Europe have taken to espousing environmental programmes as a way to bring their influence to bear on intractable problems – and incidentally to maintain high-profile roles and win popular support without courting political controversy. The Dutch royal family campaigns on water scarcity and flooding, Prince Albert of Monaco has taken a leading role in marine conservation, including battling plastic pollution, and the Nordic royals highlight the dangers to the Arctic from global heating. There have been missteps along the way, though, and not just for Harry – in 2014 his elder brother, William, was roundly criticised for shooting wild boar and deer with Spanish royals the day before launching a wildlife appeal."

Lowest activity since ‘Energiewende’ began in 2000
FOCUS cites wind industry officials who say that the building of wind parks has reached the lowest point in 20 years. The industry associations are calling on the government to take action and for approval procedures for wind farms to be simplified and acceptance by residents increased.
Falling acceptance

Many German states have imposed strict setback rules to keep wind parks away from residential areas. For example, the 10H rules is in effect in Bavaria. Here, a wind turbines cannot be located near residents  at a distance that is closer than 10 times its height, making many wind projects in the south German state impossible.  The industry is pressuring governments to soften the rules.
Yet an online poll conducted by FOCUS shows that almost two thirds of respondents are not in favor or are undecided on reducing setback distances.
Protest against wind energy “booming these days”
Earlier in 2019, Germany’s centre-left Tagesspiegel here reported, “The protest against wind energy is booming these days” and according analysts, “about 1000 citizens’ initiatives are currently fighting against the wind industry in Germany” and that “they are very well networked”.
55% less turbines built in 2019
The lack of acceptance among the public — along with economic and technical obstacles — has put the brakes on wind park construction. FOCUS writes: “According to the industry associations Bundesverband Windenergie (BWE) and VDMA Power Systems, only 325 new wind turbines with 1078 megawatts were built in 2019. This was 55 percent less than in the previous year.”

"Hillsides across Britain have turned from glorious purple to muddy brown because of a worrying loss of heather, conservationists have warned. The National Trust has flagged up that 75% of the plant has been lost or is struggling on some slopes that it manages in the west of England and blames the climate emergency for the problem.  Experts from the Heather Trust, which is based in Dumfries and Galloway, south-west Scotland, said it was seeing similar problems across moorland in Scotland, northern England and Wales. According to the National Trust, the hills at Long Mynd in Shropshire and Holnicote in Somerset are typically awash with a haze of purple through August and into early September. But this year the National Trust, which cares for both landscapes, has seen up to 75% of the heather in poor health due to a combination of last year’s drought and damage from the heather beetle. Peter Carty, its countryside parkland and gardens manager in Shropshire, said: “Last year’s high temperatures, and subsequent lack of rain, damaged a large area of heather and it is clear from the orangey-brown coloration this year that the plants are seriously stressed and unlikely to flower. “The milder winter also led to an increase in the heather beetle numbers, which are a natural element of the heather ecosystem, as it wasn’t cold enough to kill off their larvae. The beetle affects heather by damaging the outer layers of the leaf, making it more susceptible to drought stress. “In places where heather was sheltered from the extreme or where damp conditions were present, the heather has survived. However, there will be no mass flowering this year.” Carty, who has worked in the area for 20 years, said the slopes were the dullest in living memory and blames the climate emergency. The state of the heather on the Shropshire hills had improved over the decades with conservationists working with the “commoners” who have the rights to graze animals on the slopes to limit the damage sheep can cause. The lack of blooming heather has serious impacts on other wildlife, such as the red grouse and emperor moth, which in its caterpillar stage relies on the plant for food. Carty said: “At this time of year the slopes should be purple and stunningly beautiful. The sight of the heather is one of the highlights of the year. It’s really sad. It brings it home to me that no matter how much work landowners and conservationists do, climate change is the much wider problem we have to address.” Keith Jones, a climate change specialist at the National Trust, added: “We are seeing first-hand the impacts of climate change on at least two of these special landscapes within our care. “Last year’s prolonged hot summer vastly restricted the supply of water to the plants. This, together with the lack of rain over the winter and first half of the year, has not been enough to replenish the plants.” The team at Holnicote on the edge of Exmoor is working on a solution to help with the land drying out by planting more trees to help slow the flow of water further up the valley as part of its Riverlands project. It is also restoring wet habitats such as blanket bogs and mire which hold water after high rainfall and release it slowly in times of drought. Basil Stow, an area ranger for the National Trust in Exmoor, added: “We are seeing damage across hundreds of acres of heather and on our neighbouring land. One of the unfortunate consequences of the heather suffering is that tougher plants such as molinia [moor grass] have chance to take hold. “Heather is a resilient plant and capable of regenerating from the rootstock or from seed – so we will need to watch and wait to see what happens next year but we are hopeful that it will recover with careful management.” Anne Gray, the director of the Heather Trust, echoed the concerns. She said: “One of our trustees told me just yesterday that he has been out on moorland in the north of England quite extensively in the last couple of weeks and had never seen beetle damage as bad as it is this year. It is worrying.” But she added the heather could recover. She said: “Though plants can look dead, they are often not and will recover if they get decent growing conditions in following years and are also not too severely attacked by beetles during those recovery years. Being careful to ensure they are not grazed too heavily during recovery will also help.”"
"Queensland’s most influential farm lobby group, AgForce, has backed calls for a review of consensus science on the Great Barrier Reef, as the state’s agricultural sector intensifies its campaign against proposed water quality regulations. On Friday the release of two key reports painted an alarming picture of the state of the reef. The Queensland-led water quality report – which rated the water quality at inner reefs as “poor” – highlighted the impact of land management practices that contribute to the degradation of the reef due to sediment and nutrient run-off. The findings were released at a critical point in debate about the Queensland government’s proposed regulations, which would set variable pollution limits in separate reef catchments. Agricultural groups say those regulations will have a significant impact on farmers; particularly graziers, sugarcane growers and tropical horticulture. Some farmers accept the consensus science, but claim the regulations are ill thought out and will have unintended consequences for primary producers. This is also the formal position of the LNP opposition. But increasingly, sober debate about the impact of the regulations has veered into science scepticism; pushed by the controversial scientist Peter Ridd, some of the larger peak industry bodies, backbench LNP MPs and opaque front groups. The AgForce chief executive, Michael Guerin, in a statement to Guardian Australia sent before the release of the latest reef reports, said the organisation agreed with Ridd’s calls for the science “to be more thoroughly examined and tested”. Last week Guardian Australia revealed that an expert panel led by the former chief scientist Ian Chubb had warned ministers that Ridd is misrepresenting robust science about the plight of the reef, and compared his claims to the strategy used by the tobacco industry to raise doubt about the impact of smoking. Guerin said there “was no absolute consensus” on the reef. “We are not scientists and have no position on the science. However, when eminent reef scientists call into question the research conducted by their peers, we as a community would be foolish not to listen. “We are simply asking the government to make sure of the science before it implements such momentous changes with potentially devastating consequences for so many.” The AgForce general president and ABC board member Georgie Somerset will speak at a protest rally of famers in Townsville on Tuesday to coincide with a sitting of the state parliament. The event is being promoted by the opaque front organisation Farmers United, with flyers quoting Ridd and featuring the AgForce logo. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The industry argues regulation is not necessary, and that “best management practice” measures, led by agricultural groups and funded by government, were the best method to address water quality issues. Earlier this year, in protest against the proposed regulations and citing privacy concerns, AgForce deleted a decade of data from its BMP database. The Queensland environment minister, Leeanne Enoch, said on Friday that the reef water quality report showed that voluntary BMP programs were not working quickly enough, and that urgent action was needed to address the health of the reef. “The report … shows land-based run-off still remains a problem and that urgent changes are needed if we are going to meet our targets,” Enoch said. “The report also shows that many farmers have been doing good work to help improve the quality of run-off, but unfortunately the science is showing that uptake has not been fast enough. “For example, we want 90% of sugarcane land across the reef catchments managed using best management practice systems by 2025. But, the results show this was happening on only 9.8% of land so far. “Overall water quality modelling showed only a 0.3% reduction in dissolved inorganic nitrogen and a 0.5% reduction in sediment in 2017-2018 across all regions. “This simply isn’t enough. There are also a lot of scores that are poor, or very poor.” As large agricultural groups seek to question the science, largely on the basis of a single opinion rejected by scores of other reef scientists, questions have grown about whether they can continue to manage millions in grants allocated for reef water quality measures. AgForce jointly manages Queensland-funded BMP programs. AgForce last year lobbied in support of the controversial $433m federal grant to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, and at the time noted that “agricultural land is one of many factors which can affect water quality and the long term health” of the reef. The Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson has written to the federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, suggesting groups that receive reef foundation grants to improve water quality, but who otherwise seek to question the underlying science, have a conflict of interest. He cited support for Ridd’s recent lecture tour from regional branches of the peak organisation Canegrowers. “On the face of it, this is a conflict of interest. The activity of Queensland Canegrowers (as a subcontractor) is impairing the ability of the foundation to improve water quality in the reef.”"

After celebrating at Twitter the passage of the symbolic climate emergency in the EU Parliament in Strasbourg on Thursday, parliamentarian Sven Giegold of the Green Party hops on a jet to Berlin!
We’ve all heard about the EU declaring a global climate emergency. Man has to profoundly alter its behavior if we are to have any hope of rescuing the planet.
Altering behaviour means not doing lots of convenient things like flying, eating meat, driving, heating with gas, coal or oil, consuming far less, taking vacations locally so as not to involve transportation by cruise ship, plane or automobile.
That’s what Europeans parliamentarians will be expecting of us.
Green hypocrites
It turns out that one of these parliamentarians is German Sven Giegold (50) of the Green Party. Last Thursday in Strasbourg Mr. Giegold voted in favor of the “climate emergency”, reports Germany’s Berliner Zeitung (BZ) here. Immediately he celebrated the Parliament’s decision on Twitter as an “important sign at the right time”.

Yes! Das Europaparlament ruft den #Klimanotstand aus! Ein wichtiges Zeichen zur richtigen Zeit. Es sind entscheidende Jahre für zukünftige Generationen! Ganz traurig: Große Teile der Christdemokraten haben dagegen gestimmt. #ClimateEmergency pic.twitter.com/Ml3bStr2UI
— Sven Giegold (@sven_giegold) November 28, 2019

Giegold’s tweet in English: “Yes! The European Parliament proclaims the #Climate crisis! An important sign at the right time. These are crucial years for future generations!
In his tweet, he also criticized the German CDU parliamentarians for not supporting the emergency declaration, adding: “Sadly, large sections of the Christian Democrats voted against. #Climate Emergency.”

238 kg of CO2 in a single afternoon
Giegold’s act alone of course comes as no surprise considering he’s from the Green Party. But the BZ then adds: “The problem: immediately after the meeting he got on the plane, flew to Frankfurt, from there to Berlin (CO2 footprint: 238 kilograms)”!
Obviously Giegold could not be bothered booking a train ride from Strasbourg to Berlin, which he demands of all other ordinary citizens.
Giegold’s glaring hypocrisy massively criticized 
According to the BZ, the “EU Green was caught at Tegel Airport and promptly caught a massive firestorm of criticism on the net.”
Giegold’s grand act of hypocrisy was called “a certain double standard” by German CDU politician Sven Schulze, who hit back at Giegold’s criticism of CDU parliamentarians’ votes against the measure: “Very sad colleague @sven_giegold is rather your #hypocrisy. In the morning in the #Europaparlament you proclaim the #Climate emergency and in the afternoon you take the plane for the short distance from Frankfurt to Berlin. (Didn’t the #greens want to ban these short flights?)”.
“Had to be in Berlin at 6 pm”
Indeed the German Greens are pushing for a ban of short domestic flights. Giegold, though, seems to believe he’s above all that.
According to German tabloid Bild here, Giegold insisted that he had no choice but to fly. Bild writes: “At 6 pm he had an appointment in the Federal Council. Giegold said: ‘In the evening I had the obligation to be in Berlin – at 6 pm. The vote in Strasbourg was over at 12.45 pm. It was impossible with the train.'”
“International and European policymaking impossible without flying”
“The flight was purely work-related, and not for private purposes,” said the Green EU parliamentarian. He added: “International and European policymaking are impossible without air transport. It is important that European democracy works,” Giegold continued.
Wow.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhile the headlines naturally focused on an intense heat wave over a region centered over France and Germany last week, the global warming ambulance chasers worked overtime avoiding and ignoring the real story: vast, continent-wide cold spreading across Russia.
Heat and cold zero-sum
First at the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE), Klaus Öllerer reported how the Sahara heat ended up being a “zero-sum” event for the northern hemisphere region of Europe and Asia.
Öllerer wrote last week that despite the heat that took place in large parts of Europe, it was cooler than usual in other neighboring parts. Only a certain area in Central Europe (purple area) was particularly hot. Around it, it was less warm (yellow) and cooler than usual (blue):

“Even large parts of the Sahara are cooler than usual (blue). This is no wonder, as the heat is now in Europe and cooler air flows into the Sahara,” Öllerer wrote.

“The above-average warm areas balance out with the above-average cold areas,” he concluded. “The current warming is a zero-sum game! Historically, such events have occurred again and again.”
“It is even the case that in cooler times – such as the Little Ice Age – warm summer extremes were more frequent than in the last one hundred years and more,” Öllerer added.

"Nearly every candidate that participated in CNN’s seven-hour climate town hall agreed that we need to invest trillions of dollars in building a clean energy economy fit for the 21st century, and create hundreds of thousands if not millions of jobs in the process. However impressive these commitments are, they won’t be worth much if they don’t also take on the fossil fuel industry. There was plenty of common ground to be found on Wednesday night, where candidates happily focused more on presenting their own visions than tearing down those of their opponents. On what to do with dirty energy companies, though, the differences couldn’t be starker.  As the Intercept’s Akela Lacy reported shortly before the debate, Joe Biden today is scheduled to attend a $2,800-a-head fundraiser hosted by Andrew Goldman, the co-founder of a company that specializes in opening up new markets for natural gas. Asked about that fact, Biden and his team went on the defense: technically Goldman is not involved in the day-to-day management of the company, and as such Biden fundraising off him doesn’t violate the terms of the Fossil Free Pledge activists pressured him to sign several months back, that he won’t take donations from the industry over $200. The Sunrise Movement – which has pressured candidates to take the pledge – has now called on Biden to cancel the event. A few minutes later, after a heated exchange about Goldman, Biden demurred on whether he would ban fracking and talked up the climate legacy of an Obama administration that oversaw the shale boom and the end of the ban on crude oil exports. Bernie Sanders, meanwhile, has pledged in his plan for a Green New Deal to make the fossil fuel industry enemy No 1, cutting into their business model and holding them accountable for the years they spent spreading misinformation about global warming. Elizabeth Warren rightly called out the fact that focusing on plastic straws and lightbulbs – as last night’s moderators at CNN insisted on doing – distracts from the fact that responsibility for this crisis is concentrated among a small number of corporations; just 90 companies – most of them fossil fuel producers – have been responsible for two-thirds of manmade greenhouse gas emissions since the dawn of the industrial age. There has been plenty of debate this cycle over candidates’ relative positions on nuclear energy, with policy wonks not unreasonably arguing that it could be risky to take that option off the table entirely. But any climate plan that doesn’t challenge the gargantuan power of the fossil fuel industry head-on is flatly denying several realities about our energy system. While the cost of renewables has plummeted over the last several years, their share of our energy mix has remained largely flat. Use of natural gas – what Amy Klobuchar called a “transitional” fuel – will need to decline 74% by mid-century, if we’re to take the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change seriously, but is poised to grow dramatically over the next several years via fresh development in the Permian and Appalachian basins. Building even prodigious amounts of clean power won’t stop that, or magically outcompete incumbent fuels. In short, there is nothing “inevitable” about the transition to renewables. The extended discussions about carbon pricing further left out the uncomfortable fact that – if that price isn’t high enough or complemented by stringent regulations – it could kill coal while driving business to big oil and gas companies not impacted by modest fees on pollution. That could trigger a massive build-out of dirty infrastructure, new long-term contracts could lock the world into an emissions that would make it virtually impossible to meet our climate goals – let along the hugely ambitious one of “well below 2C” outlined by the Paris climate agreement every candidate praised last night. What’s more, coal, oil and gas companies, along with investor-owned utilities, have spent millions of dollars to mislead the public about the existence of the climate crisis and blocking policies to curb it at every level of government. Just last year in Washington state, BP spent $13m in a successful attempt to kill a modest carbon tax – a proposal it theoretically supports. How do candidates think they will respond to their plans to create a carbon free America by mid-century at the latest? There’s no way around it: curbing the climate crisis means going to war with the fossil fuel industry – not attending their fundraisers.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHistory shows French heat waves used to be far deadlier. The year 1911 saw an uninterrupted scorching summer and tens of thousands of lives lost.
As is the case with modern reports claiming all new “unprecedented events” written by the climate ambulance chasing media, we usually find out days later that such events have in reality happened before and were in fact far worse.
This is the case with the last week’s French “record-breaking” heat wave.
“Crushing” heat wave of 1911
French online Le Parisien here looks back at the “crushing”, “almost uninterrupted” heat wave of 1911, which dragged 70 tortuous days from early July to mid September.
Le Parisien writes how Paris “cooked” under the scorching heat and how “thousands of babies were lost”.

Not only Paris was “burning”, but so were other locations across western Europe. Le Parisien reports how temperatures soared to 40°C in Lyon, Bordeaux and London.

15 days long the thermometer refused to go below 30°C
The French say that when July is hot, a cool August usually follows. But that was not the case in 1911. August was even worse: “For fifteen days in a row, the Parisian thermometer refused to go below 30°C!”
Le Parisien describes how the public turned sour against meteorologists, who had predicted the heat would soon recede and the heat nightmare would end. But that did not happen until mid September.
41,072 dead, record mortality rate
In total the heat wave claimed more than 40,000 lives, Le Parisien reports. Parts of Paris ran out of water and the dailies reported “the list of victims, mowed down by heat or its consequences” and how “from July 23 to 29, then from August 13 to 19, mortality reached record highs.”
Le Parisien summarized: “In total, the 1911 heat wave, which lasted until mid-September, caused 41,072 deaths in France” and that most of the victims were either the elderly or babies under two years of age. Overall the tragedy saw infant mortality increase 20%.
“This year will have to be marked with a black cross,” wrote a doctor in his diary. In contrast, the French heat wave of 2003 killed 15,000.
500,000 dead in 1636
There were also other “murderous summers” in France, Le Parisien writes that thanks to the work of Emmanuel Le Roy-Ladurie, “we know that a terrible heat wave in 1636 killed 500,000 of King Louis XIII’s subjects.” Many of the deaths resulted from epidemics of dysentery as water supplies dwindled and soured.
700,000 deaths, swarms of locusts in 1718-19
Le Parisien also cites the three-volume “Histoire humaine et comparée du climat” (Human and Comparative History of Climate), which describes how the the summers of 1718-19 saw “700,000 deaths recorded” and how the Paris region had been “transformed into the Sahara” and even saw “the appearance of swarms of locusts!”

Share this...FacebookTwitterDuring the winter of 2016-’17 nearly 25,000 Italian citizens died from the seasonal flu. No one blinked.
In well over 3 months since its purported inception, the COVID-19 virus is claimed to be responsible for less than 50,000 deaths globally (as of the 1st of April).
Every year, about 500,000 people from across the world die from the five-month-long seasonal flu.
During the last pandemic, the swine flu (H1N1) killed up to 575,000 people.
This was interestingly classified as “fairly mild” for total pandemic deaths in 2012 (ABC NEWS).

Image Source: ABC NEWS
A closer look at Italy
A recent study (Rosano et al., 2019) indicates that 68,000 Italians died from the flu during the 2013-’14 to 2016-’17 flu seasons.
Specifically, there were 24,981 flu deaths in 2016-’17 and 20,259 seasonal flu fatalities occurred in 2014-’15.

These high death rates from the flu epidemic didn’t receive global attention.

Image Source: Rosano et al., 2019
Italy currently (1 April, 2020) has surpassed 13,100 deaths attributed to COVID-19 infections.
But it is highly likely the COVID-19 virus has been circulating throughout Italy for months, not weeks.
According to two Stanford medical professors, an entire Italian town of 3,300 was tested for the virus on the 6th of March (2020). 2.7% tests came back positive, which was 130 times greater an infection rate than the infection rate confirmed by that date.

Image Source: the Blaze
What this means is the infection rate is perhaps two orders of magnitude more extensive than we know.
Accurate calculation of death rates can only be inferred from dividing the deaths by the total number of infected cases – not just the confirmed ones.
Consequently, the death rate from infection could be far lower than we currently imagine…on par with, or even lower than, the seasonal flu.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMay normally is a month that sees rapid snow melt in Alps. But this year May was an unusually cold month across Central Europe and parts of the Alps saw heavy snow accumulation.
A week ago, on May 25, BR public broadcasting reported here how May snow levels at Germany’s tallest peak, Zugspitze, reached a 20-year high at just over 6 meters of depth. The article wrote that experts thought the depth would not rise further.
But that turned out to be wrong.
Highest level since February, 1981
Four days later, on May 29, another 35 cm were added and pushed the depth to 6.40 meters, according to wetteronline.ch here. the website wrote: “Zugspitze: Never so much snow since 1981.” The website added that the snow depth there was “higher than it has been since February 1981.”
What follows is a webcam image of the Zugspitze peak from May 29th:

Gained 190 cm in May
The following is a chart depicting snow levels at Germany’s highest peak for the month of May. Clearly we see that snow accumulated during the month rather than melted.

Wetterline wrote: “In May, the last time there was a similar amount was in 1980. The previous snow record of the Zugspitze also dates from this year: 7.80 meters of snow were registered on April 26, 1980.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterA commentary posted by Thomas Sigmund at the online German business daily “Handelsblatt” here warns of the consequences of introducing a CO2 tax in Germany.
https://www.handelsblatt.com/meinung/kommentare/kommentar-angela-merkel-ist-klimakanzlerin-fuer-einen-tag/25778402.html
The German greens and socialists have been calling for ramping up climate protection efforts as a way to reboot the economy in the wake of the COVID-19 economic meltdown and that the country should not return to its “old structures.”
The latest figures suggest Germany’s economy is starting its worst recession in its postwar history. 10.1 million people in Germany registered for reduced work hours by April 26, far beyond all the forecasts of economists.
Sigmund writes that going even more green and putting “further burdens” on the economy are not the answer. He writes that the climate protection plans drawn up earlier, in a time of full employment, “will not last” and that Chancellor Merkel “has even greater concerns at the moment.”
Would only exacerbate already deep recession 
“It is difficult to imagine that in this historic economic downturn further burdens will be imposed on companies,” Sigmund comments. “Those who continue to demand that CO2 emissions be priced are exacerbating the recession and torpedoing the planned economic stimulus package.”
A matter of “preventing mass unemployment”
Sigmund adds: “The shutdown gives us an idea of what industrialization means. It’s now a matter of preventing mass unemployment and not making the social explosives even bigger.”
At the Petersberg Climate Dialogue, an informal preparation for the UN Climate Summit in autumn – done via video link – Chancellor Angela Merkel said climate protection would not be pushed off the political agenda in the EU, and would be “just as much on the agenda as health issues”.

"Dear Greta, Thank you for travelling across the Atlantic to north America to help us do the most important work in the world. There are those of us who welcome you and those who do not because you have landed in two places, a place being born and a place dying, noisily, violently, with as much damage as possible. It has always been two places, since the earliest Europeans arrived in places where Native people already lived, and pretended they were new and gave them the wrong names. You can tell the history of the United States – which are not very united now – as the history of Sojourner Truth, the heroine who helped liberate the enslaved, as that of the slaveowners and defenders of slavery, as a place of visionary environmental voices such as Rachel Carson and the corporate powers and profiteers she fought and exposed. Right now the US is the country of Donald Trump and of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, of climate destroyers and climate protectors. Sometimes the Truths and the Carsons have won. I believe it is more than possible for Ocasio-Cortez and the Green New Deal to win, for the spirit of generosity and inclusion and the protection of nature to win – but that depends on what we do now. Which is why I’m so grateful that you have arrived to galvanize us with your clarity of vision and passionate commitment. To be a climate activist anywhere on Earth now is to stand at a crossroads: heaven on one side and hell on the other Not long ago I talked to a powerful climate organizer who began her work when she was only a little older than you, and she told me that her hope right now is that people recognize that this is a moment of great possibility, of openings and momentum, and a growing alarm and commitment to what the changing climate requires of us. Something has changed, thanks to you and to the young people who have brought new urgency and vision to the climate movement. Many people have become concerned and awake for the first time, and the conversation we need to have is opening up. People are ready for change, or some of us are. This is what’s being born in the US and around the world: not only new energy systems, but new social systems with more room for the voices of those who are not white or male or straight or neurotypical. The old energy system was about centralized control and the malevolent power of Gazprom and BP, Shell and Chevron, and the governments warped into serving them rather than humanity. The new system must not only be about localized energy, but democratized decision-making, about the rights of nature and the rights of the vulnerable and the future, over profit. Some of this is already here: not only the larger groups you’re surely heard of – the Sunrise Movement, 350.org, the Sierra Club, Rainforest Action Network – but countless local and tribal groups that have arisen to stop this pipeline or that coal port or these fracking projects, to protect this forest or this mountain or these waters. They are not visible the way the United Nations or the US Congress or European Union is, but their work matters, and perhaps we will build a lot of this transition out from below – but we need the big policy agendas set from above as well. Everywhere I see remarkable things happening. No matter how much you see of this big country, this huge continent, there is more than you can see. I hope you have a chance to see some of the beauty of the American landscapes, from rainforests to deserts; there is also beauty in the passionate commitment around the country. Coalminers in Kentucky have been blocking a coal train track for a month, because their bankrupt company stiffed them on wages, and coalminers elsewhere recently spoke to this newspaper about their clarity that coal is over and that the Green New Deal and its jobs are welcome. The gigantic coal-burning, sky-polluting Navajo Generating Station in Arizona will shut down later this year, and, Scientific American reported, “Its average annual emissions over that period are roughly equivalent to what 3.3 million passenger cars would pump into the atmosphere in a single year. The Navajo Generating Station isn’t alone. It’s among a new wave of super-polluters headed for the scrap heap,” including giant plants in Kentucky and Pennsylvania.” Last year, US coal plants with annual emissions of 83 million tonnes of carbon were shut down. Several states – California, New York, Hawaii, New Mexico – have made commitments to 100% renewable electricity in the near future, and while the federal government tries to push us backward, many states lean forward. This summer Texas began to get more energy from wind than from coal. Iowa in the midwest now gets 37% of its electricity from wind, not because of idealism alone, but pragmatism: wind is cheaper. Science magazine reported last month, “Solar plus batteries is now cheaper than fossil power,” and a Connecticut newspaper recently announced that Chubb, the largest commercial insurer in the USA, will stop insuring coal plants and coal mining. Worldwide, we are in the midst of an energy revolution that dwarfs the industrial revolution: human beings will for the first time not use fire, will not release carbon into the sky, to get most of our energy. We will inevitably transition away from fossil fuels as a primary energy source, and the question is only when. If we do it swiftly, we minimize damage to the climate; if we wait, we maximize it. The damage is here, and it’s not only destroying nature, it’s killing us. When the California town of Paradise burned down last November, at least 86 people burned to death or choked on smoke; millions suffered from the smoke that spread across the region. Heat deaths are up in the south-west, where 235 people died in Arizona alone from this cause during 2017. But we also know that there are so many uncounted deaths from poisonous fossil fuels. We know that many of the refugees on the USA’s southern border are climate refugees, driven out of their homes in Central America by the failure of agriculture from unpredictable and violent weather, heat, and drought. We know that Alaska was this month for the first time ice-free all along its coast, and the hot dry weather inland led to horrific wildfires. “Starting on the fourth of July and lasting multiple days, temperatures across Alaska were 20 to 30 degrees above average in some locations,” reported National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. To be a climate activist anywhere on Earth now is to stand at a crossroads: heaven on one side and hell on the other. Heaven because the transition we need to make and are making – just not big enough or fast enough – is not only an power-generation revolution, but a decentralization of political power, a shift away from the big energy companies who used governments to make wars and make profits for them, a shift away from the poisonousness of fossil fuel. Hell because the destruction of what it took nature millions of years to create – the exquisite balance of ecosystems, of bird migration in harmony with seasons, of symbioses between species, of the great Himalayan and Andean glaciers whose waters feed so many people, of rainforests and temperate forests – is hideous as well as terrifying. The Amazon is burning because of one rightwing leader and a system that rewards agricultural products but not forest protection, even though we need rainforests more than we need the soybeans and beef raised on the land stolen from the rainforest and its indigenous inhabitants. I’ve mentioned a bit of what is going on in my troubled, complicated country, the US, but of course these are global conflicts and global situations, and the solutions are advancing almost everywhere, because they are good solutions to terrible problems. You have come to help us choose the former over the latter, and more of us thank you than you will ever be able to see or hear. More than that, we’re with you, trying to realize the goals that the climate demands of us, to make a sustainable world for those who are young now, those yet to come, and for the beauty of the world that is still with us. • Rebecca Solnit is a journalist and author."

"Faced with a looming ferocious summer with little rain forecast, the New South Wales government has embarked on a Noah’s Ark type operation to move native fish from the Lower Darling – part of Australia’s most significant river system – to safe havens before high temperatures return to the already stressed river basin. Researchers have warned of other alarming ecological signs that the Lower Darling River – part of the giant Murray-Darling Basin – is in a dire state, following last summer’s mass fish kills. Professor Fran Sheldon, from Griffith University’s Australian Rivers Institute, said only one surviving colony of river mussels had been found along the river and there were signs that river red gums were under severe stress. “If the river red gums die, and some are hundreds of years old, there will be a domino effect. Banks will collapse, there will be massive erosion and it will send sediments down the river.” “These sort of ecological collapses are much harder and expensive to reverse,” she warned. The New South Wales government announced a $10m rescue package last week to mitigate the effects of the river crisis on native fish this summer. The NSW agriculture minister, Adam Marshall, said the unprecedented action would provide “a lifeline for key native species ahead of an expected summer of horror fish kills”. “We’re staring down the barrel of a potential fish Armageddon, which is why we’re wasting little time rolling out this unprecedented action,” Marshall said. “By starting this operation today we’re getting on the front foot while we still have the chance to rescue and relocate as many fish as possible.” Last December and January fish began dying in their hundreds of thousands in the far west of the state at Menindee, leaving weirs and waterholes carpeted with dead fish. While fish deaths have occurred in the past, the scale was unprecedented and stunned Australians. Several scientific reports said the lack of flow in the river due to the drought and exacerbated by irrigation upstream were to blame. When temperatures soared to over 40C and were followed by a cool change, the water in the pools stratified, leading to deoxygenation of the deeper water, killing fish. But there are already doubts about how effective the $10m program will be. The unprecedented operation aims to move as many fish as possible from 15 to 20 priority waterholes in a two-week period, including Murray cod, some of which are at least 25 years old, golden perch and other rare species. Boats with electrostatic fishing equipment will be used to stun the fish in weir pools and waterholes along the Darling at Menindee, where they will scooped up and loaded into special climate-controlled transport to a section of the Darling further south, near Wentworth, where the river joins the Murray, which is still flowing. Department of Primary Industries fisheries scientists are targeting fish contained within drying pools that are not expected to last through the summer. “By moving these fish, such as Murray cod and golden perch, we’re providing the best possible chance of survival,” Marshall said. • Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning But the government has not said how many fish it will move. One source told the Guardian it was hoped it would be in the hundreds. This is just a fraction of the population of the river and will not prevent the likelihood of further mass fish deaths during the coming summer. “It’s a photo-op rather than a real deal,” said a Menindee local, Graeme McCrabb, who has become a spokesman for the local community on the lower Darling. “There would be 10,000 cod between Weir 32 [at Menindee] and the Murray,” he said. “And silver perch, listed as a vulnerable species, are difficult to catch with electro fishing.” “If Lake Wetherill goes, there will be even more fish die than last year,” McCrabb warned. A program last summer to install aerators in larger waterholes near Menindee, which aimed to stir the water and restore oxygen, was only marginally successful due to the size of the pools and the vast length of the river. Meanwhile, the NSW government appears to be in denial about possible causes of the ecological catastrophe last summer. The water minister, Melinda Pavey, has criticised her own independent adviser, the NSW Natural Resources Commission, which said extractions by irrigators upstream may have led to the Lower Darling being pushed into hydrological drought three years earlier than it otherwise would have been. The commission has called for an urgent revision of the rules that allow irrigators to continue to extract from the river when flows are very low. It wants the threshold when irrigators must cease to take water from the river to be raised, along with other rule changes. “The NRC report was one of a number that has given advice on this issue,” said Sheldon, who contributed to the report. “It’s a contentious issue. We just raised the question: have [the extraction rules] influenced the conditions that have led to the catastrophic drying of the Barwon-Darling?” “If the answer is that extractions did contribute, then the answer is straightforward: we need to change the rules. “If they didn’t, then the answer is a whole lot more complex. We need to understand what is really going on.” “The fish rescue program will preserve some genetic diversity, but the government also needs to monitor the surrounding ecosystems, as [returning] fish would not survive if mussels and other invertebrates are lost,” she said. The government said the fish would be able to migrate back up the 500km of the Darling when the drought ended. “When flows do return to normal, the fish will be able to migrate to their ‘homes’ back upstream, without the need for additional intervention,” Marshall said. • On 10 September 2019 this article was amended.

"On a sweltering Thursday evening in Manhattan last month, people across New York City were preparing for what meteorologists predicted would be the hottest weekend of the year. Over the past two decades, every record for peak electricity use in the city has occurred during a heatwave, as millions of people turn on their air conditioning units at the same time. And so, at the midtown headquarters of Con Edison, the company that supplies more than 10 million people in the New York area with electricity, employees were busy turning a conference room on the 19th floor into an emergency command centre. Inside the conference room, close to 80 engineers and company executives, joined by representatives of the city’s emergency management department, monitored the status of the city power grid, directed ground crews and watched a set of dials displaying each borough’s electricity use tick upward. “It’s like the bridge in Star Trek in there,” Anthony Suozzo, a former senior system operator with the company, told me. “You’ve got all hands on deck, they’re telling Scotty to fix things, the system is running at max capacity.”  Power grids are measured by the amount of electricity that can pass through them at any one time. Con Edison’s grid, with 62 power substations and more than 130,000 miles of power lines and cables across New York City and Westchester County, can deliver 13,400MW every second. This is roughly equivalent to 18m horsepower. On a regular day, New York City demands around 10,000MW every second; during a heatwave, that figure can exceed 13,000MW. “Do the math, whatever that gap is, is the AC,” Michael Clendenin, a company spokesman, told me. The combination of high demand and extreme temperature can cause parts of the system to overheat and fail, leading to blackouts. In 2006, equipment failure left 175,000 people in Queens without power for a week, during a heatwave that killed 40 people. This year, by the evening of Sunday 21 July, with temperatures above 36C (97F) and demand at more than 12,000MW every second, Con Edison cut power to 50,000 customers in Brooklyn and Queens for 24 hours, afraid that parts of the nearby grid were close to collapse, which could have left hundreds of thousands of people without power for days. The state had to send in police to help residents, and Con Edison crews dispensed dry ice for people to cool their homes. As the world gets hotter, scenes like these will become increasingly common. Buying an air conditioner is perhaps the most popular individual response to climate change, and air conditioners are almost uniquely power-hungry appliances: a small unit cooling a single room, on average, consumes more power than running four fridges, while a central unit cooling an average house uses more power than 15. “Last year in Beijing, during a heatwave, 50% of the power capacity was going to air conditioning,” says John Dulac, an analyst at the International Energy Agency (IEA). “These are ‘oh shit’ moments.” There are just over 1bn single-room air conditioning units in the world right now – about one for every seven people on earth. Numerous reports have projected that by 2050 there are likely to be more than 4.5bn, making them as ubiquitous as the mobile phone is today. The US already uses as much electricity for air conditioning each year as the UK uses in total. The IEA projects that as the rest of the world reaches similar levels, air conditioning will use about 13% of all electricity worldwide, and produce 2bn tonnes of CO2 a year – about the same amount as India, the world’s third-largest emitter, produces today. All of these reports note the awful irony of this feedback loop: warmer temperatures lead to more air conditioning; more air conditioning leads to warmer temperatures. The problem posed by air conditioning resembles, in miniature, the problem we face in tackling the climate crisis. The solutions that we reach for most easily only bind us closer to the original problem. The global dominance of air conditioning was not inevitable. As recently as 1990, there were only about 400m air conditioning units in the world, mostly in the US. Originally built for industrial use, air conditioning eventually came to be seen as essential, a symbol of modernity and comfort. Then air conditioning went global. Today, as with other drivers of the climate crisis, we race to find solutions – and puzzle over how we ended up so closely tied to a technology that turns out to be drowning us. Like the aqueduct or the automobile, air conditioning is a technology that transformed the world. Lee Kuan Yew, the first prime minister of independent Singapore, called it “one of the signal inventions of history” that allowed the rapid modernisation of his tropical country. In 1998, the American academic Richard Nathan told the New York Times that, along with the “civil rights revolution”, air conditioning had been the biggest factor in changing American demography and politics over the previous three decades, enabling extensive residential development in the very hot, and very conservative, American south. A century ago, few would have predicted this. For the first 50 years of its existence, air conditioning was mainly restricted to factories and a handful of public spaces. The initial invention is credited to Willis Carrier, an American engineer at a heating and ventilation company, who was tasked in 1902 with reducing humidity in a Brooklyn printing factory. Today we assume that the purpose of air conditioning is to reduce heat, but engineers at the time weren’t solely concerned with temperature. They wanted to create the most stable possible conditions for industrial production – and in a print factory, humidity curled sheets of paper and smudged ink. Carrier realised that removing heat from the factory air would reduce humidity, and so he borrowed technology from the nascent refrigeration industry to create what was, and still is, essentially a jacked-up fridge. Then as now, air conditioning units work by breathing in warm air, passing it across a cold surface, and exhaling cool, dry air. The invention was an immediate success with industry – textile, ammunition, and pharmaceutical factories were among the first adopters – and then began to catch on elsewhere. The House of Representatives installed air conditioning in 1928, followed by the White House and the Senate in 1929. But during this period, most Americans encountered air conditioning only in places such as theatres or department stores, where it was seen as a delightful novelty. It wasn’t until the late 1940s, when it began to enter people’s homes, that the air conditioner really conquered the US. Before then, according to the historian Gail Cooper, the industry had struggled to convince the public that air conditioning was a necessity, rather than a luxury. In her definitive account of the early days of the industry, Air-Conditioning America, Cooper notes that magazines described air conditioning as a flop with consumers. Fortune called it “a prime public disappointment of the 1930s”. By 1938 only one out of every 400 American homes had an air conditioner; today it is closer to nine out of 10. What fuelled the rise of the air conditioning was not a sudden explosion in consumer demand, but the influence of the industries behind the great postwar housing boom. Between 1946 and 1965, 31m new homes were constructed in the US, and for the people building those houses, air conditioning was a godsend. Architects and construction companies no longer had to worry much about differences in climate – they could sell the same style of home just as easily in New Mexico as in Delaware. The prevailing mentality was that just about any problems caused by hot climates, cheap building materials, shoddy design or poor city planning could be overcome, as the American Institute of Architects wrote in 1973, “by the brute application of more air conditioning”. As Cooper writes, “Architects, builders and bankers accepted air conditioning first, and consumers were faced with a fait accompli that they merely had to ratify.” Equally essential to the rise of the air conditioner were electric utilities – the companies that operate power plants and sell electricity to consumers. Electric utilities benefit from every new house hooked up to their grid, but throughout the early 20th century they were also looking for ways to get these new customers to use even more electricity in their homes. This process was known as “load building”, after the industry term (load) for the amount of electricity used at any one time. “The cost of electricity was low, which was fine by the utilities. They simply increased demand, and encouraged customers to use more electricity so they could keep expanding and building new power plants,” says Richard Hirsh, a historian of technology at Virginia Tech. The utilities quickly recognised that air conditioning was a serious load builder. As early as 1935, Commonwealth Edison, the precursor to the modern Con Edison, noted in its end-of-year report that the power demand from air conditioners was growing at 50% a year, and “offered substantial potential for the future”. That same year, Electric Light & Power, an industry trade magazine, reported that utilities in big cities “are now pushing air conditioning. For their own good, all power companies should be very active in this field.” By the 1950s, that future had arrived. Electric utilities ran print, radio and film adverts promoting air conditioning, as well as offering financing and discount rates to construction companies that installed it. In 1957, Commonwealth Edison reported that for the first time, peak electricity usage had occurred not in the winter, when households were turning up their heating, but during summer, when people were turning on their air-conditioning units. By 1970, 35% of American houses had air conditioning, more than 200 times the number just three decades earlier. At the same time, air-conditioning-hungry commercial buildings were springing up across the US. The all-glass skyscraper, a building style that, because of its poor reflective properties and lack of ventilation, often requires more than half its electricity output be reserved for air conditioning, became an American mainstay. Between 1950 and 1970 the average electricity used per square foot in commercial buildings more than doubled. New York’s World Trade Center, completed in 1974, had what was then the world’s largest AC unit, with nine enormous engines and more than 270km of piping for cooling and heating. Commentators at the time noted that it used the same amount of electricity each day as the nearby city of Schenectady, population 80,000. The air-conditioning industry, construction companies and electric utilities were all riding the great wave of postwar American capitalism. In their pursuit of profit, they ensured that the air conditioner became an essential element of American life. “Our children are raised in an air-conditioned culture,” an AC company executive told Time magazine in 1968. “You can’t really expect them to live in a home that isn’t air conditioned.” Over time, the public found they liked air conditioning, and its use continued to climb, reaching 87% of US households by 2009. The postwar building spree was underpinned by the idea that all of these new buildings would consume incredible amounts of power, and that this would not present any serious problems in the future. In 1992, the journal Energy and Buildings published an article by the British conservative academic Gwyn Prins, arguing that the American addiction to air conditioning was a symbol of its profound decadence. Prins summarised America’s guiding credo as: “We shall be cool, our plates shall overflow and gas shall be $1 a gallon, Amen.” During the time that air conditioning was reshaping America’s cities, it had little effect elsewhere. (With some exceptions – Japan, Australia and Singapore were early adopters.) Now, however, air conditioning is finally sweeping across the rest of the world. If the march of air conditioning across the US tracked its postwar building and consumption boom, its more recent expansion has followed the course of globalisation. As the rest of the world adopts more Americanised ways of building and living, air conditioning follows. In the 1990s, many countries across Asia opened up to foreign investment and embarked on an unprecedented urban building spree. Over the past three decades, about 200 million people in India have moved to cities; in China, the number is more than 500 million. From New Delhi to Shanghai, heavily air-conditioned office buildings, hotels and malls began to spring up. These buildings were not only indistinguishable from those in New York or London, but were often constructed by the same builders and architects. “When you had this money coming in from the rest of the world for high-end buildings, it often came with an American or European designer or consultancy attached,” says Ashok Lall, an Indian architect who focuses on housing and low-energy design. “And so it comes as a package with AC. They thought that meant progress.” As the rate and scale of building intensified, traditional architectural methods for mitigating hot temperatures were jettisoned. Leena Thomas, an Indian professor of architecture at the University of Technology in Sydney, told me that in Delhi in the early 1990s older forms of building design – which had dealt with heat through window screens, or facades and brise-soleils – were slowly displaced by American or European styles. “I would say that this international style has a lot to answer for,” she said. Just like the US in the 20th century, but on an even greater scale, homes and offices were increasingly being built in such a way that made air conditioning indispensable. “Developers were building without thinking,” says Rajan Rawal, a professor of architecture and city planning at Cept University in Ahmedabad. “The speed of construction that was required created pressure. So they simply built and relied on technology to fix it later.” Lall says that even with affordable housing it is possible to reduce the need for air conditioning by designing carefully. “You balance the sizes of opening, the area of the wall, the thermal properties, and shading, the orientation,” he says. But he argues that, in general, developers are not interested. “Even little things like adequate shading and insulation in the rooftop are resisted. The builders don’t appear to see any value in this. They want 10- to 20-storey blocks close to one another. That’s just how business works now, that’s what the cities are forcing us to do. It’s all driven by speculation and land value.” This reliance on air conditioning is a symptom of what the Chinese art critic Hou Hanru has called the epoch of post-planning. Today, planning as we traditionally think of it – centralised, methodical, preceding development – is vanishingly rare. Markets dictate and allocate development at incredible speed, and for the actual inhabitants, the conditions they require to live are sourced later, in a piecemeal fashion. “You see these immense towers go up, and they’re already locking the need for air conditioning into the building,” says Marlyne Sahakian, a sociologist who studies the use of air conditioning in the Philippines. Over coffee recently in London, the influential Malaysian architect Ken Yeang lamented what he viewed as the loss of an entire generation of architects and builders to a dependency on fossil fuels to control the environment. “So much damage has been done by those buildings,” he says, “I have entirely lost hope in my generation; perhaps the next one can design a rescue mission.” To its proponents, air conditioning is often presented as a simple choice that consumers make to improve their lives as they climb the economic ladder. “It’s no longer a luxury product but a necessity,” an executive at the Indian branch of the Japanese air-conditioner manufacturing giant Daikin told the Associated Press last year. “Everyone deserves AC.” This refrain is as familiar in Rajasthan now as it was in the US 70 years ago. Once air conditioning is embedded in people’s lives, they tend to want to keep it. But that fact obscures the ways that consumers’ choices are shaped by forces beyond their control. In her 1967 book Vietnam, Mary McCarthy reflected on this subtle restriction of choice in American life. “In American hotel rooms,” she wrote, “you can decide whether or not to turn on the air conditioning (that is your business), but you cannot open the window.” One step towards solving the problem presented by air conditioning – and one that doesn’t require a complete overhaul of the modern city – would be to build a better air conditioner. There is plenty of room for improvement. The invention of air conditioning predates both the first aeroplane and the first public radio broadcast, and the underlying technology has not changed much since 1902. “Everything is still based on the vapour compression cycle; same as a refrigerator. It’s effectively the same process as a century ago,” says Colin Goodwin, the technical director of the Building Services Research and Information Association. “What has happened is we’ve expanded the affordability of the air conditioner, but as far as efficiency, they’ve improved but they haven’t leaped.” One scheme to encourage engineers to build a more efficient air conditioner was launched last year by the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI), a US-based energy policy thinktank, and endorsed by the UN environment programme and government of India. They are offering $3m to the winner of the inaugural Global Cooling prize. The aim is to design an air conditioner that is five times more efficient than the current standard model, but which costs no more than twice as much money to produce. They have received more than a hundred entries, from lone inventors to prominent universities, and even research teams from multibillion-dollar appliance giants. But, as with other technological responses to climate change, it is far from certain that the arrival of a more efficient air conditioner will significantly reduce global emissions. According to the RMI, in order to keep total global emissions from new air conditioners from rising, their prize-winning efficient air conditioner would need to go on sale no later than 2022, and capture 80% of the market by 2030. In other words, the new product would have to almost totally replace its rivals in less than a decade. Benjamin Sovacool, professor of energy policy at Sussex University and a lead author on the next Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, describes this ambition as not impossible, but pretty unlikely. “This idea of technology saving us is a narrative that we want to believe. Its simplicity is comforting,” he says. It has proven so comforting, in fact, that it is often discussed as if it is our first and best response to climate change – even as the timeframe for inventing and implementing such technologies becomes so narrow as to strain credulity. New air-conditioner technology would be welcome, but it is perhaps “the fourth, or maybe fifth thing on the list we should do” to reduce the emissions from air conditioning, says Diana Ürge-Vorsatz, a professor of climate change and energy policy at Central European University, and a lead author on the forthcoming IPCC report. Among the higher priorities that she mentions are planting trees, retrofitting old buildings with proper ventilation, and no longer building “concrete and glass cages that can’t withstand a heatwave”. She adds: “All of these things would be cheaper too, in the long run.”  But while these things are technically cheaper, they require changes in behaviour and major policy shifts – and the open secret of the climate crisis is that nobody really knows how to make these kind of changes on the systematic, global scale that the severity of the crisis demands. If we are not about to be rescued by technology, and worldwide policy changes look like a distant hope, there remains a very simple way of reducing the environmental damage done by air conditioning: use less of it. But, as the ecological economist and IPCC author Julia Steinberger has written, any serious proposals to change our lifestyles – cutting down on driving, flying or imported avocados – are considered “beyond the pale, heretic, almost insane”. This is especially true of air conditioning, where calls to use it less are frequently treated as suggestions that people should die in heatwaves, or evidence of a malicious desire to deny other people the same comforts that citizens in wealthy countries already enjoy. This summer, the publication of a New York Times article asking “Do Americans need air conditioning?” touched off a thousand furious social media posts, uniting figures from the feminist writer and critic Roxane Gay (“You wouldn’t last a summer week in Florida without it. Get a grip”) to the conservative professor and pundit Tom Nichols (“Air conditioning is why we left the caves … You will get my AC from me when you pry it from my frozen, frosty hands”). Despite this backlash, there is a reasonable case to be made that we are over-reliant on air conditioning and could cut back. The supposedly ideal indoor temperature has long been determined by air-conditioning engineers, using criteria that suggest pretty much all humans want the same temperature range at all times. The underlying idea is that comfort is objective, and that a building in Jakarta should be the same temperature as one in Boston. In practice, says Leena Thomas, this means that the temperature in most air-conditioned buildings is usually “low-20s plus/minus one”. But not everyone has accepted the notion that there is such as thing as the objectively “right” temperature. Studies have suggested that men have different ideal temperatures from women. In offices around the world, “Men toil in their dream temperatures, while women are left to shiver,” argued a 2015 article in the Telegraph, one of many suggesting that the scientific research had simply confirmed something millions of women already knew. Researchers have also shown that people who live in hotter areas, even for a very short time, are comfortable at higher indoor temperatures. They contend that, whether it is a state of mind or a biological adjustment, human comfort is adaptive, not objective. This is something that seems obvious to many people who live with these temperatures. At a recent conference on air conditioning that I attended in London, an Indian delegate chided the crowd: “If I can work and function at 30C, you could too – believe you me.” Adding to the weight of evidence against the idea of the “ideal” temperature, Frederick Rohles, a psychologist and member of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, has conducted studies showing that subjects who were shown a false thermometer displaying a high temperature felt warm, even if the room was cool. “These are the sorts of things that drive my engineering colleagues crazy,” he wrote in 2007. “Comfort is a state of mind!” Ashok Lall points out that once people are open to the idea that the temperature in a building can change, you can build houses that use air conditioning as a last resort, not a first step. “But there is no broad culture or regulation underpinning this,” he says. At the moment, it is the deterministic camp that has control of the levers of power – and their view continues to be reflected in building codes and standards around the world. How, then, can we get ourselves out of the air-conditioning trap? On the continuum of habits and technologies that we need to reduce or abandon if we are to avoid the worst effects of the climate crisis, the air conditioner probably falls somewhere in the middle: harder to reduce than our habit of eating meat five times a week; easier than eliminating the fossil-fuel automobile. According to Nick Mabey, a former senior civil servant who runs the UK-based climate politics consultancy E3G, air conditioning has – like many consumer products that are deeply embedded in society and, in aggregate, drive global warming – escaped the notice of most governments. There is little precedent for top-down regulation. “There is no department that handles this, there’s no guy you can just go talk to who controls air conditioning,” he says. The key, Mabey says, is to find the places it can be controlled, and begin the push there. He is supporting a UN programme that aims to improve the efficiency – and thus reduce the emissions – of all air conditioners sold worldwide. It falls under the unglamorous label of consumer standards. Currently, the average air conditioner on the market is about half as efficient as the best available unit. Closing that gap even a little bit would take a big chunk out of future emissions. At the local level, some progress is being made. The New York City council recently passed far-reaching legislation requiring all large buildings in the city to reduce their overall emissions by 40% by 2030, with a goal of 80% by 2050, backed with hefty fines for offenders. Costa Constantinides, the city council member spearheading the legislation, says it is “the largest carbon-emissions reduction ever mandated by any city, anywhere”. The Los Angeles mayor’s office is working on similar plans, to make all buildings net-zero carbon by 2050. Other cities are taking even more direct action. In the mid-1980s, Geneva, which has a warmer climate than much of the US, the local government banned the installation of air conditioning except by special permission. This approach is relatively common across Switzerland and, as a result, air conditioning accounts for less than 2% of all electricity used. The Swiss don’t appear to miss air conditioning too much – its absence is rarely discussed, and they have largely learned to do without. In countries where air conditioning is still relatively new, an immense opportunity exists to find alternatives before it becomes a way of life. The aim, in the words of Thomas, should be to avoid “the worst of the west”. Recently, the Indian government adopted recommendations by Thomas, Rawal and others into its countrywide national residential building code (“an immensely powerful document” says Rawal). It allows higher indoor temperatures based on Indian field studies – Indian levels of comfort – and notes the “growing prevalence” of buildings that use air conditioning as a technology of last resort. Cutting down on air conditioning doesn’t mean leaving modernity behind, but it does require facing up to some of its consequences. “It’s not a matter of going back to the past. But before, people knew how to work with the climate,” says Ken Yeang. “Air conditioning became a way to control it, and it was no longer a concern. No one saw the consequences. People see them now.” • This article was amended on 29 August 2019.
