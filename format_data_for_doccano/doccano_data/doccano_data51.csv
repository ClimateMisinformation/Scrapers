"The world may increasingly look to geoengineering in the wake of the latest UN climate report, which says it could be adopted as a temporary “remedial measure” if the world heads towards dangerous levels of warming. The authors of the new 1.5C study by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change say there is high agreement that the injection of millions of tonnes of sulphur dioxide into the stratosphere could help limit temperature rises to the most ambitious target of the Paris accord. But the authors warn there are major uncertainties about the social, environmental and ecological impacts, which mean the world would be far better off if policymakers strengthened natural cooling systems such as forest cover and accelerated efforts to reduce carbon emissions. The lengthy document – which was approved at the weekend by all 195 nations in the UN – mentions several options for man-made interference in climate systems, including ocean fertilisation, carbon dioxide removal, marine cloud brightening, cirrus cloud thinning and ground-based albedo modification. A key finding of the new IPCC report is the dramatic difference that restricting warming to 1.5C above pre industrial levels would have on the global environment. The scientists found: • By 2100, global sea level rise would be 10cm lower with global warming of 1.5C compared with 2C. • Extreme heatwaves will be experienced by 14% of the world's population at least once every five years at 1.5C. But that figure rises to more than a third of the planet if temperatures rise to 2C • Arctic sea ice would remain during most summers if warming is kept to 1.5C. But at 2C, ice free summers are 10 times more likely, leading to greater habitat losses for polar bears, whales, seals and sea birds. • If warming is kept to 1.5C, coral reefs will still decline by 70-90% but if temperatures rise to 2C virtually all of the world's reefs would be lost But it focused most on stratospheric aerosol injection, a technique that essentially mimics the effect of a volcano by pumping gas into the sky that turns into aerosols, which reflect part of the sun’s heat. Although the authors do not include such strategies in their pathways to 1.5C above pre-industrial temperatures, they raise the possibility that it could be used as a supplementary measure if this target is missed. “If mitigation efforts do not keep global mean temperature below 1.5C, solar radiation modification can potentially reduce the climate impacts of a temporary temperature overshoot, in particular extreme temperatures, rate of sea level rise and intensity of tropical cyclones, alongside intense mitigation and adaptation efforts,” the report observes. A search for palliatives will be necessary as the world is almost certain to miss the 1.5C goal. Current national pledges are forecast to lead to at least 3C of warming by the end of the century – and that is if governments keep their commitments. The IPCC is clearly hesitant to endorse such emergency measures in part because this could allow government leaders to continue pushing problems into the future, but also because of the immense risks involved. The report notes that the injection of sulphur dioxide would change rainfall patterns and weather circulation as well as disrupting stratospheric chemistry and ice formation. It could also result in more ultraviolet light exposure, which would have a negative impact on human health. Ethical and institutional questions also arise over who would oversee such operations and which areas would be affected. The report suggests a number of UN organisations as possible supervisory bodies. But authors also observe that there are scarcely any laws or regulations to stop any country that wants to push ahead by itself. The only guideline cited was the Convention on Biodiversity which states “no climate-related geoengineering activity that affects biodiversity may take place.” There are doubts also over effectiveness. While the aerosols might constrain temperature rises, they would not stop the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and the acidification of the oceans. What happens when this “temporary measure” is halted is also an area of concern, as the planetary system might suddenly be hit by a surge in temperature. The IPCC says these uncertainties constrain the ability to implement solar radiation management in the near future. But with the 1.5C target current on course to be overshot at some point between 2030 and 2052, the urgency is likely to grow. Johan Rockström, coauthor of the recent Hothouse Earth study, said the IPCC report was likely to stimulate discussion of these extreme emergency measures. “I think this will raise solar radiation management to the highest political level. We currently have no framework for this,” he said. “I’m very scared of this technology but we need to turn every stone now.” James Hansen said the tipping point in public opinion was more likely to come at a slightly higher temperature, but by then it may already be too late. “2C would force geoengineering on today’s young people. Geoengineering, if global temperature passes 2C, would start, at the latest, once ice sheet collapse begins,” he told the Guardian. “Unfortunately, because of the inertia of the system, geoengineering then would probably be too late to prevent locking in the eventual loss of coastal cities.”"
"Faced with a major UN report that warns of floods, drought, extreme heat and increased poverty should the world not take radical action to address climate change, Donald Trump has been uncharacteristically quiet. The US president was visiting Florida, a state particularly vulnerable to sea level rise and currently in the path of Hurricane Michael, when the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report warned on Monday that “unprecedented” changes were needed to stave off dire impacts if the world warms 1.5C beyond the pre-industrial period.  Trump, who has previously called climate change a “hoax” and questioned whether global warming was occurring because it snowed last winter, told reporters only that he was aware of the report: “It was given to me. And I want to look at who drew it … Because I can give you reports that are fabulous, and I can give you reports that aren’t so good. But I will be looking at it, absolutely.” Trump has been at odds with the rest of the world when it comes to climate change, with the US the world’s only country to disavow the Paris climate agreement, which committed governments to attempt to stay within the 1.5C limit. The planet has already warmed by around 1C over the past 150 years. “I don’t think the administration cares about this at all,” said Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&M University, prior to Trump’s brief comments. “They just want to figure out how to ignore it all. It’s really disappointing. It’s a real failure that the US government isn’t helping people understand there’s a train coming down the track fast at us and we need to get out of the way.” “We need an international agreement where there is leadership. It would be great if that was the US, but someone else has to step up now.” The US Environmental Protection Agency, which has an official position that climate change is harmful to public health, thanked the “hard work of the scientists and experts” but said it did not “formally endorse specific findings presented by the authors”. Under the Trump administration, the EPA has taken a more industry-friendly stance, weakening greenhouse gas rules around oil drilling and vehicle fuel efficiency, as well as tearing up an Obama-era plan to limit pollution from coal-fired power plants. The agency removed its section on climate change from its website last year for an “update” that has yet to materialize. A spokeswoman for the state department said the US is “leading the world in providing affordable, abundant and secure energy to our citizens, while protecting the environment and reducing emissions through job-creating innovation”. She pointed out that US carbon dioxide emissions in 2017 were at their lowest level since 1992, outlining an approach to climate change that has “unburdened communities, individuals and industries by allowing them to develop and implement policies that fit their needs”. According to the IPCC report, however, far deeper cuts – resulting in net zero emissions by 2050 – will be required if the world is to avoid warming beyond 1.5C. Scientists have warned that the enormous changes in energy, transportation and land use required to meet this goal are technically possible, but currently appear unlikely. “Keeping warming below 1.5C will be very, very hard,” said Dessler. “It’s going to take a reimagining of how the world is constructed around us and we are lacking imagination. Fundamentally, we need to change the politicians in Washington. That’s the key.”"

"Only half-jokingly, some residents of a progressive city 300 miles north of the Mexican border have adopted the “build the wall” slogan in the face of a wave of newcomers. But these perceived interlopers are starkly different from Donald Trump’s imagination. They are American, mainly white and are fleeing the unlivable heat. Arizona’s vast sweep of landscapes stretches from the scorched western movie backdrop of the Sonoran desert in the south, past rusty red sandstone outcrops further north in Sedona until you ascend to Flagstaff, a pleasant city carved into the largest expanse of ponderosa pine trees in the world, at an elevation of 7,000ft. Flagstaff, population 70,000, has long been a destination for people in southern Arizona looking for a cooling respite in summer or a spot of skiing on the nearby San Francisco Peaks in winter. But rising temperatures, driven by human-induced climate change, mean that many in Flagstaff fret they are now being overrun by those fleeing sweltering cities such as Phoenix and Tucson. A pattern of climate-driven gentrification is taking hold across the US, as those who are able to retreat from floods, storms, heatwaves and wildfires shift to safer areas, bringing soaring property and rental values with them. “As it gets hotter, we are getting a lot of climate refugees,” said Coral Evans, Flagstaff’s mayor. “We don’t mind people moving to Flagstaff at all. But about 25% of our housing is now second homes. The cost of living is our number one issue. “We don’t talk much about what climate change means for social justice. But where are low-income people going to live? How can they afford to stay in this city?” There are usually a tangle of reasons – jobs, love, education – as to why people decide to move, but Flagstaff’s agreeable climate is jostling towards the front. Last summer, Phoenix was so hot that road signs and mailboxes melted. Planes couldn’t take off or land. On a recent July day this year, when Phoenix hit 116F (47C), Flagstaff, a two-hour drive and a world away, was 80F (27C). Amanda Ormond moved to Phoenix in 1985, first working in bars after leaving college before becoming a clean energy consultant. Ormond recalls stuffing her children into thick coats when trawling houses for trick or treating at Halloween. By the time the family moved permanently to Flagstaff three years ago, wearing anything warmer than shorts and T-shirts at that time of year was unthinkable. It will get worse – Phoenix, the fastest-warming large city in the US, could spend close to half of its year in over 100F (37C) heat within 30 years. “If you choose to live in the desert you have to learn how to live in the desert,” Ormond said. “You worry about your car breaking down and so you have tons of food and water in it. “But the heat used to break around September. Now, it’s October, sometimes November. We literally have six months of above 90F (32C). Mentally, you need a break. You can’t leave your house. It’s fatiguing.” Ormond still owns her house in Tempe, which adjoins Phoenix. “We had this home and when I look around I think, ‘I just can’t see how this is gonna be a good investment for 20 years with climate change.’” Phoenicians able to move, or even vacation, in cooler climes such as Flagstaff are usually older and wealthier. Those who still work can often do so remotely. The influx has aroused concerns in Flagstaff, where rents and property values have soared. “The tenor in the town is ‘Stop building. Build a wall,’” said Jenny Niemann, a climate and energy specialist at the city of Flagstaff. “People joke about that. But I think it’s fair to say the town feels incredibly stressed by the increasing prices, as well as the development.” While the western US is increasingly baked by heatwaves and choked by smoke from wildfires, the pressing concern in eastern states is that their coasts are being redrawn by sea level rise and pummeled by ever-stronger hurricanes. More than 300,000 homes near US coasts face being chronically flooded within 30 years. This unfolding scenario is reshaping previous lines of segregation in coastal cities. As investors shift capital to higher ground and shoreline properties become costlier in terms of insurance and repairs, low- to middle-income people are squeezed out from both areas. A recent study of the greater Miami area shows this process is already under way – properties at high elevations are experiencing rising values, while those situated just 3ft above sea level have declined in value, even when other factors are accounted for. This trend has largely taken hold since 2000. “It’s a pretty clear signal and there’s evidence it’s happening across the US,” said Jesse Keenan, a climate adaptation expert at Harvard who authored the Miami report. “The very wealthy can afford to throw money away but moderate- to low-income people can’t, so there’s an inequality to living immediately on the coast.” According to Keenan, climate gentrification is not just a supply problem – real estate developers actively marketing elevated areas as safe investments – but also a demand one – buyers are starting to swarm to higher ground. “This is happening neighborhood to neighborhood, city to city, state to state,” he said. “It’s such a huge spectrum of geography that we are going to have make moral judgments about what to protect and what to let go. There’s not enough money to protect everyone. We need a complete mobilization, similar to the effort of putting a man on the moon, to adapt our coasts.” Residents of the Miami districts of Liberty City and Little Haiti, traditionally African American and Hispanic areas, are seeing their neighborhoods transform around them. The districts, which sit a relatively safe 15ft above sea level, are currently having holes punched into them by bulldozers to make way for half a dozen apartment developments. “We are already seeing low-income homes and businesses being evicted, the new developments are popping up everywhere,” said Valencia Gunder, a Liberty City resident turned activist who grew up hearing warnings about gentrification that are now being realized. Previously blighted by poverty and crime, Liberty City is now seen as an attractive base for those worried their beachfront properties will soon be swamped. In 2000, no one in Liberty City paid more than $1,000 a month in rent – now it’s roughly one in six. Property prices have also risen sharply. “People are being forced out to places like Georgia and Alabama, where it’s more affordable,” said Gunder. “It’s becoming so expensive. These developers aren’t making Liberty City better for the people who already live here.” Even cities with cerebral approaches to climate change are at risk of upheavals that cut deepest in poorer, minority communities. Norfolk, Virginia, has reacted to some of the fastest sea level rises in the world with an ambitious plan that cedes some territory to the tides, while breaking up some housing projects and relocating residents. Local activists worry this will mean low-income, black communities will be displaced as their coastal neighborhoods are gentrified. “This is a red alarm issue,” said Mustafa Ali, who spent 25 years at the Environmental Protection Agency’s office of environmental justice. “We need to make better decisions around resilience and vulnerable communities need to be brought into that conversation. A whole lot of folks are being left behind.” In Flagstaff, the city is already straining to keep up. “Town gets crazy on the weekends when it’s 115F [46F] in Phoenix,” said Nicole Antonopoulos, Flagstaff’s head of sustainability. “Are we building our systems in a manner that can support a massive influx? No. Can our existing infrastructure support that? No.” Flagstaff also faces its own climate change threats – increased wildfires in the surrounding Coconino national forest, the associated risk of flooding rains washing freely down treeless slopes on to the city, pressure on the water supply. Growing numbers of homeless people are traveling to Flagstaff to camp in the woods, heightening local fears over unintended conflagration. Antonopoulos, who has helped develop a draft climate plan for Flagstaff to confront this new reality, recalls the sky turning black from ash after the nearby Schultz fire, in 2010. “I was walking to work with a bandanna on and literally chunks of burning trees were falling everywhere,” she said. “When we’ve got climate refugees it’s going to put more stress not only on our infrastructure but also our natural resources.” The hand of climate change is everywhere – from water availability to insurance markets to housing pricing – while rarely being identified as a culprit. As temperatures continue to escalate, prior inequities are likely to be exacerbated, injustices risk deepening. “Whether it’s happening already is unclear but I think more and more people are going to be moving because of climate change,” said Brian Petersen, a climate change and planning academic at Northern Arizona University. “The people marginalized already in society will bear the brunt of this. Poor people in Las Vegas or Phoenix who can’t get away from the heat are not going to be leaving to go to beautiful, expensive mountain towns.” Even those who do make it to Flagstaff and other refuges, such as Oregon or near the Great Lakes, won’t be shielded from the transforming climate. Enough future warming has been locked into the world’s climate system to touch everywhere on Earth. “At some point, Flagstaff’s going to be in the rear-view mirror,” said Petersen. “We’re going to be going to farther north places or other continents.”"
"Maricela Ruelas is a manager at a vineyard in Medford, Oregon. She trims, harvests – whatever needs doing. This year, she has done much of that work in a face mask. Wildfire smoke has plagued her and her fellow workers nearly continuously for “a couple of months”, she said through a translator, leading to pounding headaches. “It was horrible, horrible this year.” For Ruelas, the smoke isn’t just a nuisance; it’s an economic hardship. She and her co-workers are paid by the hour, so when they have to leave work early because their heads and lungs hurt, they don’t get paid. And Ruelas sends less money home to her grown children in Guadalajara. The west is drier, hotter than ever, frequently on fire. Thanks to reduced snowpacks in the mountains, the soil is parched by early summer and forests are tinder. What firefighters once called a “fire season” is now referred to as a “fire year”, since the fires start so early and rage deep into fall. These extreme phenomena are causing some people to consider leaving the western US, a place long conceptualized in the American imagination as the land of balmy weather and fresh starts. Some have already left. They are sick of wildfire smoke; worried that a lack of water will destroy their communities or about climate migrants from other parts of the country; and struggling with the heat itself. “I felt bad leaving people behind who don’t have that ability to uproot,” said Michael Lakeman, a New Zealander who moved with his American wife and kids back to his home country from Seattle this summer. “We’d been living in Seattle for 17 years, really good life. Good jobs, good friends, nice house.” The seed of the idea to move was planted when Donald Trump won the presidential election. Lakeman and his wife didn’t want their daughters growing up in a “political climate of misogyny” – but Lakeman also worried about the effects of climate change, including wildfire smoke and the disruptions caused by internal migration away from the hottest cities. As a consultant on renewable energy, he thought about climate change a lot. He worried about Seattle, already straining from the influx of many tech workers, ending up as an overcrowded refuge for those fleeing drought and heat in the desert south-west. “What happens when the Colorado river dries up?” he wonders. “Where are the millions of people who call Phoenix and Vegas home going to go when there is no water?” Lakeman’s young daughters are adjusting to Auckland. Lakeman describes New Zealand as “small, not crowded, maritime, far away from the rest of the world – a good place to escape”. Climate change has already raised temperatures across the globe. The United States is predicted to be about 2.5F (1.4C) hotter from 2021 to 2050 compared with the late 20th century. On the porch of his home in Klamath Falls, a 64-year old marine veteran, his forearms decorated with patriotic tattoos, looks out over a sparkling blue lake and golden, grass-covered hills. The man doesn’t want to use his name because he doesn’t want his employer to know he is thinking of leaving the area. His view is stunning, but he has barely seen it lately. For most of the last few months, smoke has blanketed the Klamath Basin, reaching levels deemed “unhealthy” and “hazardous” by the Environmental Protection Agency. The man has chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder and uses an oxygen tank 24 hours a day. For much of the summer, he hasn’t even been able to come out on the porch without a mask over his oxygen tubing. The future holds little hope: researchers project that smoke from wildfires will double by mid-century and triple by 2100 in the American west. The man’s daughter is 11. He bought her a cruiser bike this summer but she hasn’t been on it once. She played video games inside instead. Every morning, the man wakes up and checks the air quality. “First thing I do when I get up, I hit refresh on my laptop to see if I can get on my porch,” he said. “It feels like you are a prisoner of your own environment.” He has told his reluctant wife and child that he is near the breaking point. “If it is like this next summer,” he said, “we’re out.” Moving might be challenging. He has calculated that a move to the Oregon coast, which sees fewer smoky days, would cost at least $5,000 in moving costs, plus a first and last month’s rent and security deposit. It is money he doesn’t have. For his last birthday, his daughter made decorations for the home he spends so much time trapped inside: glass jars filled with sand and seashells. “We can’t go to the ocean, so I brought the ocean to him,” she said. There’s another problem with the coast – experts predict up to 1.6 meters (5ft) of sea-level rise on the west coast over the next 100 years. More than 130,000 coastal homes will be at risk by 2100, and acres of wetlands that buffer storms will be lost. “I think that’s the hard part: coming to grips with the fact that there really is no safe refuge,” said Shelby Edwards, a retired major who worked on disaster preparedness in the Army and now advises companies on how to prep for the worst. “None of us humans get to escape this at this point.” Edwards moved to central Oregon just a few years ago for the sunshine, but is now looking for someplace else she, her horses and dogs can call home. For several years, smoke and falling ash has made it impossible to ride or hike for long periods – and she fears for her health after years of inhaling “colored smoke, diesel and tons of it, dust, riot control gas, and all kinds of other burning crap that gets in your lungs” during her deployments in Afghanistan. Edwards doesn’t want to leave the west, but even if she did, she says nowhere is without climate impacts. “If you go into the midwest, you’ve got drought. If you go into the east coast you have hurricanes and rising sea levels, severe storms. Their flavor of disruption is different.” She’s been searching for two years for just the right place to go within the region. One key thing she is looking for are tightly knit communities with a lot of economic diversity. She thinks they will be more resilient to any number of climate change-related problems, from fire to flooding to crop failure. “There are some communities that are brittle, that don’t have a lot of capacity for change.” The effects of climate change across the west will vary, and the shuffling of populations could be complex, according to Solomon Hsiang, an economist who studies climate change at the University of California, Berkeley. The south-west, especially Arizona and New Mexico, is already extremely hot and only getting hotter. Hsiang expects many residents there will hunker down in the air conditioning and stay. “People who have chosen to live there are often not there because they have chosen to spend lots of time outside,” he says. In places where going outside is part of the culture, like San Diego, extreme heatwaves might send more people packing. But the Pacific west – California, Oregon and Washington – is predicted to be one of the areas of the country that will warm the least under climate change, despite persistent wildfire smoke, and might end up attracting migrants from other areas of the country. So the patterns of movement will be complex, Hsiang says. It was faith in her community that helped freelance writer Cally Carswell decide to stay in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Early this year she had been spooked by an eerily warm and dry winter in an already arid city. “We barely got any snow at all,” she said. “I could see the snow on the mountains melt within a day or two each time we got snowfall.” She worried that drought might destroy the community and with it the value of her home, and wrote an essay about her indecision over whether to leave for High Country News. In the end, her research into the water-saving moves the city was making made her cautiously optimistic. But she’s not sure how long she’ll stay. “It is something we are going to have to feel out as we go,” she said Carswell, as a freelancer, is relatively free to move. It is harder for those whose livelihoods are tied to the land, like Ruelas. She knows the fires are getting worse, and worries about long-term health effects, but she does not want to leave her job. She feels powerless to do anything about the situation, though she dreams of a big machine that would absorb all the smoke that is hurting her and her co-workers. She feels that politicians and those in power don’t care about her suffering and are happy to profit off her by selling her medicine when she gets sick. She wishes that people with the luxury of working inside in climate-controlled offices would treat her with more humanity. On the smokiest days, she said, the sun looks strange and she can feel the smoke start to hurt by midday. “Sooner or later,” she says, “there will be consequences.”"

"Climate change is an existential threat to the human race. This may seem an absurd or alarmist statement, since we have been conditioned by unparallelled growth to expect that there are no catastrophes that are insurmountable. Even apocalyptic science fiction deals with bands of survivors who have, by definition, survived. And we always imagine ourselves as among the survivors.  But the threat is real. The latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change tells us that there are only a dozen or so years in which to change our economies radically if we are to keep the effects of the warming already under way to manageable proportions. That would require the countries of the world to live up to the most ambitious of the goals of the Paris climate change agreement, and keep the rise in average global temperatures to 1.5C above preindustrial levels. A rise of even half a degree above that, to 2C, will have effects that are very much worse. Already this seems much more likely. All corals will disappear, as will many insects and plants.  The disappearance of plants, and in particular the deforestation of tropical regions, is doubly dangerous, because it converts carbon sinks (which living trees are, because they absorb carbon dioxide) into producers of carbon. That is only one of the many possible tipping points which may lead to a sudden and violent escalation of the rate of change as malign feedback loops are formed. All these risks make it quite credible that we will end with a warming of 3C, 4C or even worse – and the consequences will be globally terrible, and everywhere unavoidable. Hundreds of millions of people may die through droughts on land, and flooding at the coasts, through the loss of marine species due to acidification of the oceans, and probably through the disruption of long-term weather patterns around which the world’s agriculture has been shaped. These victims will not passively await their fates. Among the tipping points that we cannot foresee in any detail is the prospect of historically unprecedented refugee migrations as whole populations who have no choice but to starve or move set out for land where they can live. The political and indeed the military consequences are unlikely to be small. None of this will only be the product of vast impersonal forces, any more than our present crisis is. There are always political and economic choices that explain our actions. A recent study identified 90 different organisations, ranging from states to private companies, that were between them responsible for nearly two-thirds of carbon emissions since 1864. They all behaved as rational, profit-seeking actors without any external responsibilities, and so brought us to the brink of catastrophe. This kind of twisted rationality exacerbates the dangerous physical effects of climate change.  The election of Jair Bolsonaro as president of Brazil now seems overwhelmingly likely, and he is committed, like Donald Trump, to withdrawing his country from the Paris accords. His policies in the Amazon basin will greatly accelerate deforestation. In Australia, the government of Scott Morrison must deal with the reality of climate change in the form of droughts and wildfires, but is at the same time denying any responsibility for the effects of its own actions when they worsen the situation. This kind of short-term selfishness can’t be overcome only by appeals to unselfishness or to solidarity. Only long-term self-interest can be stronger: perhaps the fear that international anarchy must ultimately lead to international war in an age of nuclear and biological weapons. It is not the direct effects of climate change alone but their indirect effects on the political and economic structures of the world that make it a genuinely existential threat. As individuals in the rich world, we should all eat less meat and use less fossil-fuel energy. But individual action will never be enough. We must also work to strengthen the kind of political structures that will enable, and if needed compel, the cooperation that is the only alternative to destructive anarchy."
"The social cost of carbon is a measure of the economic damages caused (via climate change) by each ton of carbon pollution that we produce today.  It’s difficult to estimate because of physical, economic, and ethical uncertainties.  For example, it’s difficult to predict exactly when various climate tipping points will be triggered, how much their damages will cost, and there’s also a question about how much we value the welfare of future generations (which is incorporated in the choice of ‘discount rate’). In 2013, the Obama administration set the federal social cost of carbon estimate at $37 per ton of carbon dioxide (up from the previous estimate of $22).  That was a conservative estimate – in recent years, research has pegged the value closer to $200 because recent research has shown that global warming slows economic growth, which makes it quite expensive.  A majority of economists in a 2015 survey believed the federal estimate was too low, but Republicans have recently been trying to dramatically lower it anyway.  The Republican argument is twofold.  First, that we should only consider domestic climate costs (the federal estimate is of global costs, because our carbon pollution doesn’t just hover in the air above America).  Second, that instead of trying to stop climate change now, we should just save our money and let future generations pay for its costs (by using a high discount rate). A new study led by UC San Diego’s Katharine Ricke published in Nature Climate Change found that not only is the global social cost of carbon dramatically higher than the federal estimate – probably between $177 and $805 per ton, most likely $417 – but that the cost to America is around $50 per ton.  That’s the second-highest in the world behind India’s $90, and is also higher than the current federal estimate for the global social cost of carbon. That’s a remarkable conclusion worth repeating.  Ricke’s team found that the cost of carbon pollution to just the United States is probably higher than its government’s current estimate of costs to the entire world.  And the actual global cost is more than 10 times higher than the federal estimate.  And yet Republican politicians think that estimate should be much lower. I asked Ricke to describe her team’s approach in this study: To calculate social cost of carbon, you need to answer four questions in sequence: 1. How would the economy change with no climate change (including GHG emissions)? 2. How does the Earth system respond to emissions of carbon dioxide? 3. How does the economy respond to changes in the Earth system? 4. How should we value losses today vs. in (for example) 100 years? The team answered these questions using four ‘modules’: a socio-economic module to answer the first question,  a climate module to address the second, a damages module to investigate the third, and a discounting module to tackle the fourth. Ricke further described the team’s approach in a ‘behind the paper’ article for Nature: The idea was to combine an approach to analyzing the climate effect of a marginal emission of carbon dioxide that Ken Caldeira and I had recently developed, with a climate damages model described in what was then a working paper by Marshall Burke and collaborators. My co-author Massimo Tavoni pointed out that by combining these two tools, we could produce the first comprehensive, country-level estimates of the social cost of carbon. I wrote about the referenced Burke paper in 2015.  That study detailed the relationship between a country’s average temperature and its per capita GDP, finding a sweet spot around 13°C (55°F).  That’s the optimal temperature for human economic productivity.  Economies in countries with lower average temperatures like Canada and Russia would benefit from additional warming, but it would slow economic growth for nations closer to the equator with hotter temperatures. The United States is currently right near the peak temperature, whereas many European countries like Germany, the UK, and France are 3–5°C cooler, and a bit below the ideal economic temperature.  So, continued global warming is worse for the US economy than Europe’s.   China’s social cost of carbon is lower despite a similar temperature and GDP to America’s because its economy is growing fast, meaning that it would benefit from investing its money now rather than spending it on cutting carbon pollution, at least relative to a more developed country like the US.  But China’s social cost of carbon is still about $26 per ton.  India’s $90 is the highest because of its combination of a hot climate, high GDP (6th in the world), and anticipated continued growth leading to large future damages. Our paper out today in Nature Clim. Change calculates the economic impact of a ton of CO2 emissions – ie, the social cost of carbon – for all countries: https://t.co/Mn0s6PMl1u pic.twitter.com/IJHt65h5ut The high US carbon cost is also a surprising result because research has shown that poorer countries are the most vulnerable to climate change impacts.  But the US has the highest GDP of any country, so it has the most to lose.  This conclusion is also consistent with the recent Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond paper finding that global warming will significantly slow American economic growth.  As Ricke explained, the US would therefore benefit from a carbon tax: In the United States, there sometimes seems to be a misconception that investments in climate change mitigation are charitable acts. Because climate change presents a more existential threat to developing countries, the argument is that having historically contributed the most CO2 to the atmosphere, the US should reduce its emissions in order to reduce the impacts of these past actions on others.  On the other hand, our analysis demonstrates that the idea that the biggest beneficiaries of reductions in carbon dioxide emissions by the US would be other countries is a myth.  Our results suggest that based on pure self-interest, the US should be willing to pay around $40/ton to avoid an emission of CO2. What’s more, the US is very consistently in the top 3 of country-level social costs of carbon – by this metric one of the biggest losers from climate change. So, America is the country with the largest historical carbon emissions (and thus the most culpability for climate change), is among the countries that would benefit most from slowing global warming, and yet is the only country whose government rejects the Paris climate agreement."
"This week, hundreds of scientists and government officials from more than 190 countries have been buzzing around a convention centre in the South Korean city of Incheon. They are trying to agree on the first official release of a report – the bit called the Summary for Policymakers – that pulls together all of what’s known about how the world might be affected once global warming gets to 1.5C.  What will happen to coral reefs? How will extreme weather events and droughts change? What about heatwaves? And then, what are the different “pathways” that economies could choose to keep temperatures to 1.5C? On Monday morning, the summary document is expected to be released, and there will be a cascade of headlines around the world. The report, being pulled together by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, was one tiny part of the Paris climate change agreement. As things stand, if you add up all the things that the 190-plus countries have committed to do as part of that Paris deal, global temperatures will probably go well above 3C. We’re already at 1C of warming, so the extra half a degree isn’t far away – many scientists will say it’s already locked in, while others say there are plausible ways to stabilise temperatures at that level. But in August, one of the world’s leading scientific journals – the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences – published a “perspective” article that has become known as the “hothouse earth” paper. There was no new science in the paper and while it was speculative, it did raise fundamental questions about the ability of governments around the world to stop the Earth from spiralling into a “hothouse”. One of the report’s authors, Professor Will Steffen, of Australian National University and the Stockholm Resilience Centre, talked me through it. The problem lies with “feedbacks” – in the “supplementary information” attached to the paper, Steffen and colleagues actually listed 10 of them. With each, they include estimates of how much extra CO2 and temperature they could add once you hit about 2C of global warming. For example, the ability of the land and ocean to keep soaking up CO2 could weaken, giving you an extra 0.25C of warming. Dieback of trees in the Amazon and subarctic could give us another 0.1C. Permafrost, which is already starting to defy its name by not being all that permanent, could release ever more methane and carbon that might add a bit more warming again (0.09C is the estimate there). The point is that once you add them all up, you get close to 0.5C of warming by the end of the century. Given we’re already at 1C of global warming, that makes the job of keeping warming “well below 2C” or even holding it at 1.5C much, much harder than it already is. And there’s the rub. While governments have the means to affect how much CO2 gets released through policies that radically cut the use of fossil fuels, it would be much harder to get a grip on thawing permafrosts, mass forest collapses or the loss of polar sea ice. By failing to get a grip on a thing that’s feasibly under your control, we end up risking the release a whole gang of other monsters that we can’t. This gets us to another big issue, says Steffen, because climate models don’t include some of these feedbacks. In essence, the warmer things get, the less reliable the models become. He tells me: “I think the dominant linear, deterministic framework for assessing climate change is flawed, especially at higher levels of temperature rise. So, yes, model projections using models that don’t include these processes indeed become less useful at higher temperature levels. Or, as my co-author John Schellnhuber says, we are making a big mistake when we think we can “park” the Earth System at any given temperature rise – say 2C – and expect it to stay there.” For those who understand the idea of a carbon budget – where scientists have calculated how much CO2 you could emit before hitting certain temperature rises – it looks even meaner than before if Steffen and his colleagues are right. But as they also point out, several of these feedbacks might have “tipping points” that then set off a cascade of other issues. Steffen says: “Even at the current level of warming of about 1C above pre-industrial, we may have already crossed a tipping point for one of the feedback processes (Arctic summer sea ice), and we see instabilities in others – permafrost melting, Amazon forest dieback, boreal forest dieback and weakening of land and ocean physiological carbon sinks. And we emphasise that these processes are not linear and often have built-in feedback processes that generate tipping point behaviour. For example, for melting permafrost, the chemical process that decomposes the peat generates heat itself, which leads to further melting and so on.” For the record, Steffen thinks the assumptions in climate models that cuts in fossil fuel emissions will deliver relative cuts in temperatures “is OK for perhaps lower temperature rises of 1.5 or 2C” but beyond that, he’s sceptical. The paper has received a bit of pushback from scientists, largely, it appears, because of the sensational headlines it attracted. For example, Professor Richard Betts, of the UK’s MetOffice, has a measured perspective that’s well worth a look. Dr Glen Peters, an Australian scientist and climate modeller based at the Centre for International Climate Research in Norway, also thought some of the media coverage went too far with the doomsday vibe. But he told me that while it was true that many of the feedbacks in the paper were not well covered by climate models, this was partly because they were not that well understood. I’ll leave you with his thoughts: “The hothouse earth paper conjectures that many of these feedbacks may interact like a domino effect, lead the Earth system to spiral out of control to reach a new steady state very different from today, and these processes may even start if we are successful at meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement. “There is also an important timescale question, are we talking decades or millennia, and that is very important for how society may respond. While all the claims made in the hothouse earth paper are justified, we simply don’t have the data to verify if those claims are true. While the paper put in plenty of language to indicate its exploratory nature … many headlines and statements went too far, indicating we had already gone too far and there was no turning back.”"
"We all love trees. We think of woods and forests as green lungs, peaceful spaces, brimming with wildlife. So when Europe’s least forested country, Ireland, sets a target to increase tree cover from 11% to 18% by 2046, we should all applaud, shouldn’t we? Unfortunately the new woodland rising across Ireland is an ecological dead zone. Sitka spruce plantations, hectare upon hectare of them, now cover what was once nature-rich farmland. Dense blocks of these non-native coniferous trees smother the landscape, driving out wonderful and endangered wildlife such as hen harriers and curlews, birds that could be extinct in Ireland within the decade.  The home of these birds is in farmland officially designated “marginal”, exactly what is considered most suitable for swaths of sterile, densely packed conifers. Ireland’s green image, a place for nature, is a mockery. For politicians and financiers, marginal means land that is borderline for modern agriculture. It is “rank”, “boggy”, ‘“acid” or “poor”, all words that have unpleasant undertones. Marginal land doesn’t make money compared to the large, industrial farming units, which are usually in more lowland and fertile areas. It can’t, by its very nature, support high densities of livestock or crops. It does, however, produce flowers, insects and ground-nesting birds in abundance, but none of these are money spinners in a traditional sense. The solutions supported by the government are devastating. The first is to transform the fields into intensively managed farmland that can support cattle and produce a crop of silage at least three times a year. This is done by draining, fertilising and planting fast-growing monocultures such as rye grass. Already much of Ireland has a bright, emerald green sheen that does little for wildlife. If that isn’t possible, then the government offers generous grants to plant fast-growing trees such as Sitka spruce. Sitka plantations guarantee a return within a few decades and they also attract absent investors, often from overseas. Many farmers sell their family farms to these private companies and move out of the area. As the trees move in, silence falls across the land. No birds sing, no bees buzz, no flowers bloom. Those who have hen harriers or curlews nesting on their land can apply for grants to manage the landscape for the birds, but usually only for a few years, making this the least financially attractive choice. For politicians in Dublin, making money from the land is a priority and they are happy to legislate to secure this. The dairy industry’s growth is one of the highest in the EU, 9.4% between January and November 2017 alone. Similarly, the forest sector has boomed mainly to offset carbon emissions from cows. Ireland is failing abysmally to meet its targets set by the EU. It ought to have cut emissions of greenhouse gases to 20% below 2005 levels by 2020, but at current rates, it will have reduced them by less than 1%. The dual pressures to grow the economy through dairy and reduce carbon emissions to meet climate change targets means Sitka spruce is marching across the land. But do plantations of conifers really act as a cure-all for Ireland’s carbon woes? Not necessarily. A lot of carbon is stored in the soils of peatland and marginal grassland. If they are disturbed, however, by ploughing, draining, tree planting and felling, they can release more carbon into the atmosphere than will be sequestered by the trees. So simply planting trees does not equate to a net lowering of carbon in the atmosphere. In addition, agriculture remains the single largest contributor to gas emissions in Ireland, and the figure will rise under the current policy. As forestry accounts for less than 4 million tonnes of carbon sequestration it cannot make up the difference. It would surely be far better to reduce the emissions from the dairy industry than plant Sitka spruce on unsuitable soils. Yet the planting goes on unabated, with dire consequences for protected wildlife. More than half of the six sites designated as special protection areas (SPAs) for hen harriers are now planted in Sitka. Money has trumped wildlife. There are only around 150 pairs of breeding hen harriers left and they require a mosaic of habitats to survive, ranging from grassland, moorland and bog to open forest. But now their home is hemmed in on all sides by Sitka plantations, which form impenetrable boundaries. To stand in one of the few remaining nesting sites is to feel like a character in a Hollywood movie where someone is trapped in a room as the walls slowly move inwards. No light penetrates to the floor and no flowers grow.  As farms disappear beneath these barren forests, villages empty and there is no one left to speak out for the birds, which are forced out too. If their breeding grounds haven’t been covered in trees, the predators that are sheltered by the forests, namely foxes, crows and pine martens, make it nigh impossible for them to raise any young. Ireland’s rich, natural heritage, as treasured as any traditional music or literature, is being swept aside because it is not considered as valuable as fast-buck plantations. The breathtaking sky dance of the male hen harrier in spring and the heart-healing bubbling of the curlew are all but gone, as these birds can’t survive without the insects that feed on wildflowers. Curlews could be extinct as a breeding bird in Ireland in less than 10 years. Kealin Ireland, a farmer from County Leitrim (a county that already has 18% Sitka coverage), is deeply worried. “We had a wonderful year with curlews flying and calling above our flower farm right throughout spring and early summer. But we’re so concerned about future years with vast tracts of lands around us being afforested with Sitka spruce. Where will the curlews nest, and how will they get to their feeding grounds at the lake?” How, indeed? If the Irish government paid farmers on marginal land to protect the natural heritage in perpetuity, instead of planting foreign trees, then it would act as a beacon to the rest of Europe. It could use public money for the public good of planting native, broad-leaved forest in some areas yet managing other lands for endangered birds. Protecting peatland and marginal grassland would also keep carbon locked in the soil. As pressure on governments to act on climate change increases, Ireland could be leading the way in Europe and showing that wildlife is valued and integral to a country’s natural heritage. Instead, its policy on forests and its failure on a massive scale to protect biodiversity is a disgrace. • Mary Colwell is a nature writer and author of Curlew Moon"
"World leaders have been told they have moral obligation to ramp up their action on the climate crisis in the wake of a new UN report that shows even half a degree of extra warming will affect hundreds of millions of people, decimate corals and intensify heat extremes. But the muted response by Britain, Australia and other governments highlights the immense political challenges facing adoption of pathways to the relatively safe limit of 1.5C above pre-industrial temperatures outlined on Monday by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). With the report set to be presented at a major climate summit in Poland in December, known as COP24, there is little time for squabbles. The report noted that emissions need to be cut by 45% by 2030 in order to keep warming within 1.5C. That means decisions have to be taken in the next two years to decommission coal power plants and replace them with renewables, because major investments usually have a lifecycle of at least a decade. Mary Robinson, a UN special envoy on climate, said Europe should set an example by adopting a target of zero-carbon emissions by 2050. “Before this, people talked vaguely about staying at or below 2C – we now know that 2C is dangerous,” she said. “So it is really important that governments take the responsibility, but we must all do what we can.” The UK, which has gone further than most nations by cutting its annual emissions by 40% since 1990, will need to step up if the more ambitious goal is to be reached. A key finding of the new IPCC report is the dramatic difference that restricting warming to 1.5C above pre industrial levels would have on the global environment. The scientists found: • By 2100, global sea level rise would be 10cm lower with global warming of 1.5C compared with 2C. • Extreme heatwaves will be experienced by 14% of the world's population at least once every five years at 1.5C. But that figure rises to more than a third of the planet if temperatures rise to 2C • Arctic sea ice would remain during most summers if warming is kept to 1.5C. But at 2C, ice free summers are 10 times more likely, leading to greater habitat losses for polar bears, whales, seals and sea birds. • If warming is kept to 1.5C, coral reefs will still decline by 70-90% but if temperatures rise to 2C virtually all of the world's reefs would be lost Claire Perry, minister for energy, said the government would outline its next steps in the next few days: “I welcome the strong scientific analysis behind today’s IPCC report and its conclusions are stark and sober. As policymakers we need to work together to accelerate the low-carbon transition to minimise the costs and misery of a rapidly warming world.” But her failure to spell out how this would be achieved was criticised by Green party MP Caroline Lucas, who said the UK government has slashed support for renewables, pushed ahead with fracking and airport expansion, and continues to subsidise fossil fuels. “If ministers are serious about taking the action they admit is needed,” Lucas said, “the government would commit today to reversing the freeze on fuel duty announced last week and lifting the ban on onshore wind turbines. And crucially, Claire Perry must stop forcing fracking on communities who’ve rejected it.” Bob Ward, of the Grantham Institute for Climate Change, said the UK had a good track record but needed to be more ambitious, which would require action across a wider area of government: “More effort is needed from other departments. For instance, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government needs to be more proactive in ensuring that buildings become zero-carbon as soon as possible. And the Department for Transport must be more ambitious on developing electric vehicles.” Politicians, scientists and climate activists will hold a meeting chaired by Lord Krebs, former member of the Committee on Climate Change, in parliament on Wednesday to discuss the new 1.5C report and consider policy options. Among those attending will be Jim Skea, a co-chair of the IPCC working group on mitigation. “My biggest hope is that they [political leaders] take this seriously,” Skea said. “We can’t carry on with business as usual or minor changes.” But there is increasing pushback by the world’s powerful fossil fuel and agribusiness interests, who are supporting politicians who are apathetic or hostile to climate action. The new IPCC report stressed the urgent need for reforestation and greater forest protection, but within hours of its release the first round of the Brazilian presidential election ended with a huge lead for Jair Bolsonaro, who has promised to quit the Paris accord and open up the Amazon rainforest to farmers and miners. Donald Trump has also announced that the US will pull out of the climate deal. And in Australia, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said there was no money for “global climate conferences and all that nonsense”. So far, however, no government has actually dropped out and civil society groups say the new report by scientists will help them put pressure on leaders to aim for the safer, lower level of warming. “Any administration, and it would appear especially the US and Australia, that pushes damaging domestic policies and picks apart science consensus is a dangerous outlier by ignoring the deadly impacts now due to climate chaos,” said Rachel Kennerley of Friends of the Earth. “International cooperation is manifestly preferable but the rest of the world will have to double down on efforts – it’s a shortsighted block to the global efforts needed that this report sets out, but it’s not insurmountable either.” Andrew Steer, president of the World Resources Institute, said the urgent message of the report “must be carried into the halls of power and the negotiation rooms at COP24. This should be a moral imperative for all leaders around the world.”"
"The familiar phrase “the wrong kind of snow” was originally used as an excuse for severe disruption on British Rail in the 1991 winter. A very small amount of unusually soft and powdery snow had found its way into the electrical systems of locomotives, causing short circuits and engine failure. It now seems that with climate change we are getting the wrong kind of rain – the sort that causes flooding. Europe has been suffering an increasing number of floods, and predicting where and when they will occur is important in reducing the damage they inflict on people and property. There are apparently three kinds: flash floods caused by sudden downpours; floods brought on by days of steady rain causing rivers to burst their banks; and floods following snow melt. The good news is that difficulties caused by a sudden thaw, which brought such devastation to Britain after the great freeze of 1947, is less of a threat now because heavy snow is such a rarity. However, instead of the steady drizzle that the UK once experienced at any season, the country now has a seasonal mixture of cloudbursts and spells of heavy rain. This, plus the extra hard surfaces being constantly added to ever-larger urban areas, makes other flooding much more likely. "
"The world’s governments are “nowhere near on track” to meet their commitment to avoid global warming of more than 1.5C above the pre-industrial period, according to an author of a key UN report that will outline the dangers of breaching this limit. A massive, immediate transformation in the way the world’s population generates energy, uses transportation and grows food will be required to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5C and the forthcoming analysis is set to lay bare how remote this possibility is.  “It’s extraordinarily challenging to get to the 1.5C target and we are nowhere near on track to doing that,” said Drew Shindell, a Duke University climate scientist and a co-author of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, which will be unveiled in South Korea next month. “While it’s technically possible, it’s extremely improbable, absent a real sea change in the way we evaluate risk. We are nowhere near that.” In the 2015 Paris climate pact, international leaders agreed to curb the global temperature rise to 2C above the era prior to mass industrialization, with an aspiration to limit this to 1.5C. The world has already warmed by around 1C over the past century, fueling sea level rises, heatwaves, storms and the decline of vulnerable ecosystems such as coral reefs. Shindell would not share exact details of the IPCC report, but he said that the more ambitious 1.5C goal would require a precipitous drop in greenhouse emissions triggered by a rapid phaseout of fossil fuels, particularly coal, mass deployment of solar and wind energy and the eradication of emissions from cars, trucks and airplanes. Even then, emerging technology will be required on a global scale to capture emissions at the source and bury them in the ground or remove carbon directly from the air. “The penetration rate of new technology historically takes a long time,” Shindell said. “It’s not simple to change these things. There aren’t good examples in history of such rapid, far-reaching transitions.” The fading prospect of keeping the global temperature rise to below 1.5C has provoked alarm among leaders of low-lying island nations that risk being inundated should the world warm beyond this point. “Every country must increase the ambition of their existing targets,” said Hilda Heine, president of the Marshall Islands, which announced a plan to reach net zero emissions by 2050 at the UN general assembly in New York this week. “If we can do it, so can everyone else.” The UN general assembly has again pitted the world’s countries against Donald Trump when it comes to climate change, with the US president using his keynote speech to praise “clean coal”. Trump has vowed to exit the Paris accord, a stance that Emmanuel Macron, the French president, told the UN should be met with consequences such as a refusal by countries to enter into trade deals with the US. “It’s a lot more difficult without the US as a leader in climate change negotiations,” Ola Elvestuen, Norway’s environment minister, told the Guardian. “We have to find solutions even though the US isn’t there.” Elvestuen said countries, including Norway, which is one of the world’s largest oil and gas producers, need to transition away from fossil fuels, embrace electric cars and halt deforestation. He admitted these changes had not happened quickly enough since the Paris deal. Last year, global greenhouse gas emissions rose slightly again after a short period of stasis. “We are moving way too slowly,” Elvestuen said. “We have to do more of everything, faster. We need to deliver on policies at every level. Governments normally move slowly but we don’t have the time.” “The 1.5C target is difficult, but it’s possible. The next four to 12 years are crucial ones, where we will set the path to how the world will develop in the decades ahead. The responsibility in doing this is impossible to overestimate. To reach the goals of the Paris agreement we need large structural changes.” A difference of 0.5C in temperature may appear small but the IPCC report, which is a summary of leading climate science, is expected to warn there will be major impacts if warming reaches 2C. “Even 1.5C is no picnic, really,” said Dr Tabea Lissner, head of adaptation and vulnerability at Climate Analytics. Lissner said a world beyond 1.5C warming meant the Arctic would be ice-free in summer, around half of land-based creatures would be severely affected and deadly heatwaves would become far more common. “0.5C makes quite a big difference,” she said."
"From the beginning of next year, a new global pact will take effect that could have a profound impact on climate change, cutting harmful greenhouse gas emissions by amounts that could help stave off some of the worst impacts predicted by the IPCC. This little-noticed treaty has nothing to do with the Paris accord, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) negotiations that have dragged on since 1992, or energy sector emissions, which have resumed their rise. The Kigali amendment, which was agreed on 15 October 2016 and comes into force on 1 January, will drastically reduce hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). These heat-trapping gases are the byproduct of industrial processes such as refrigeration and can be eliminated from those processes by re-engineering. The amendment comes under the Montreal Protocol, the world’s most successful international environmental treaty, which aims to stop the depletion of the ozone layer. HFCs are prime examples of short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs), a range of chemicals that are spewed into the atmosphere by human activities and contribute to global warming. While attempts to reduce climate change have rightly focused on the main greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, mostly produced from our use of fossil fuels, these other substances have been largely ignored. Experts estimate that cutting down on SLCPs could reduce global warming by as much as 0.5C. That would not be enough to avoid the worst effects of climate change if we continue to burn fossil fuels, but it could buy humanity some much-needed time while carbon emissions are brought under better control. “The only way to slow near-term feedbacks [which could drive climate change past tipping points] in the 15- to 20-year window before we lose control to runaway warming is to cut the SLCPs, which can provide considerably more avoided warming at mid-century than cuts to carbon dioxide can provide,” said Durwood Zaelke, founder of the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development and a reviewer of the IPCC report on the effects of 1.5C warming. “In fact, [they could provide] two to six times more [than carbon cuts].” He said the IPCC had recognised their importance. “This is the IPCC’s first acknowledgement that cutting the super pollutants – black carbon, methane, HFCs – is essential for keeping the climate safe. These cuts are the fastest way to slow down warming while we decarbonise the energy system and learn how to remove carbon from the atmosphere at the scale we need.” Many SLCPs break down relatively quickly in the atmosphere, unlike carbon dioxide, which can stick around for a century. But while they are present, they can have a greater impact: some HFCs have a global warming potential more than 11,000 times greater than that of carbon dioxide. The Kigali amendment, by avoiding the equivalent of up to 90bn tonnes of CO2 by 2050, could be “perhaps the single most significant contribution to keeping warming well below 2C, aiming for the still safer 1.5C,” Zaelke told the Guardian. A recent report, before the IPCC publication, by Oxfam and the World Resources Institute found that reducing SLCPs warranted a much greater focus than it has received in climate change efforts. “In the near term, taking fast, ambitious action to reduce SLCPs is particularly vital to keeping temperature rise below 1.5C,” the authors said. “As with present-day impacts of climate change, the impacts associated with crossing such thresholds in the future will impact poor and vulnerable communities first and worst.” Another SLCP is methane, produced when vegetation rots and from animals, and in the form of natural gas from fossil fuel exploration. Methane is more than 20 times as powerful as carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas, but few attempts are made to stop it reaching the atmosphere, even from easily containable sources such as sewage plants and intensive livestock farms, and from industrial sources such as fracking wells and oil and gas production. Soot, or black carbon, is another byproduct of burning fossil fuels, and its effects can clearly be seen at the poles, particularly the Arctic. Brown, black and grey stains over the pristine wildernesses of Greenland, Siberia and Alaska come not from natural sources but from the fall of soot from the air, carried thousands of miles from fossil fuel burning. The stains contribute to warming, because the darkened snow absorbs more heat instead of reflecting it. Soot from power station chimneys and vehicle tailpipes can be captured at source or reduced by switching to burning cleaner fuels. But getting rid of soot helps combat not just warming but also air pollution, as the particles are one of the leading causes of ill-health from environmental factors. Cutting down on soot is not straightforward, however. The contribution of aerosols such as soot and other small particles to warming is complex: while soot on Earth blackens snow and other surfaces and increases warming, aerosols high in the atmosphere deflect some of the sun’s rays back into space. This dimming effect could have already saved the world from as much as 0.5C warming that might have been expected from the quantities of carbon now in the air, according to Johan Rockström, chief scientist at Conservation International. Removing soot or stopping its release into the air might end up being of less use to the climate than stopping other SLCPs as a result, but it would save lives blighted by air pollution. Zaelke said: “With the wolf of climate impacts at our door, time for our counter-offensive is short. The 30 years of success of the Montreal Protocol should inspire us to take still stronger actions, and to use additional tailor-made agreements to address specific business sector emissions, with the full engagement of industry.”"
"A report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change confirms the enormous wisdom that governments showed in Paris in December 2015, when they agreed to the goal of “pursuing efforts” to limit global warming to 1.5C. The report’s summary for policymakers paints a sobering picture of the potentially terrible impacts of allowing global mean surface temperature to rise by 2C compared with pre-industrial levels: more extreme weather, sea level rise and ocean acidification, with detrimental effects on wildlife, crops, water availability and human health.  But the policymakers, or at least their aides, should make the effort to read the whole report. Incredibly, the stark summary is still a relatively conservative assessment of the consequences we might face if global warming does exceed 1.5C. The report is a comprehensive review of the published evidence painstakingly compiled by hundreds of authors and reviewers over the past two and a half years. The summary of the report was approved line by line by governments, including the US, Australia and Saudi Arabia, during long and intensive discussions last week in South Korea. It is written in matter-of-fact language, but it omits some of the biggest risks of climate change, which are described in the full text. For instance, the summary indicates that warming of 2C would have very damaging impacts on many parts of the world. But it does not mention the potential for human populations to migrate and be displaced as a result, leading to the possibility of war. This is a risk that many governments around the world have already recognised, with climate change often highlighted in national security assessments as a “threat multiplier”, which could increase the chances of political instability and conflict. The summary also leaves out important information about so-called “tipping points” in the climate system, beyond which impacts become unstoppable, irreversible or accelerate. It acknowledges that the land-based ice sheets in Greenland and west Antarctica may be destabilised even by warming of 1.5C, ensuring several metres of sea level rise over the coming centuries. But there is no mention of other important thresholds that might, for instance, halt the Gulf Stream in the Atlantic, or cause shifts in the occurrence of the monsoons in Africa and Asia. It is not clear why such crucial information has been left out of the summary. Perhaps the authors felt that there are too many uncertainties in our knowledge to be definitive. But the danger is that policymakers will assume the absence of these very significant risks from the summary means that researchers have assessed them to be unimportant or impossible. Uncertainties are also evident in the summary assessment of the economics of climate change and the cost of doing something about it. It indicates that, to keep to the 1.5C target, carbon prices would need to be three to four times higher than for 2C. But on the overall investment required, it states: “The literature on total mitigation costs of 1.5C mitigation pathways is limited and was not assessed in this report”. In fact, a paper on this subject was published by British economists, including some of my colleagues, in the journal Annual Review of Environment and Resources. It examined the evidence on the total investments required and concluded that over the course of this century they would only need to be 50% higher to limit warming to 1.5C instead of 2C. So not quite as scary as the numbers for a specific hike on carbon prices might suggest. These omissions in the IPCC summary are puzzling. But nevertheless the overwhelming conclusion any reasonable policymakers will reach from reading the summary is that the target of keeping global warming to 1.5C is both affordable and absolutely necessary in order to avoid highly dangerous consequences. The question now is whether world leaders such as Donald Trump and Scott Morrison, the prime minister of Australia, will ignore the IPCC report and continue their policy of inaction on climate change, including a disregard of the Paris agreement, when the impacts so clearly threaten the lives and livelihoods of people in their countries and around the world. • Bob Ward is policy and communications director at the ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy at the London School of Economics and Political Science."

"Scientists are right to stress that halting rampant deforestation is vital to mitigating climate change (Scientists say halting deforestation ‘just as urgent’ as reducing emissions, 4 October). But forests do much more than serve as carbon sinks; their value is far greater and multidimensional. They enable clean air and water, preserve the integrity of complex ecosystems, prevent soil erosion, and contain an extraordinary variety of plants, many of which are critical components of life-saving medicines.  People struggle with taking climate change seriously because it feels temporally distant, abstract, and can be hard to visualise and appreciate palpably. Deforestation, on the other hand, is much easier to visualise and understand. We must make every effort to reduce deforestation drastically and demand that countries such as Brazil, Indonesia, Malaysia and China take decisive measures to curb deforestation and contribute to afforestation and reforestation where they are ecologically advisable and viable. The US, Europe, Canada and Australia can all make far greater efforts to incentivise forest protection (including domestically), promote ecosystem integrity globally, mobilise consumers to reject products that stem from ecologically abusive behaviours, and hold to account those businesses and governments that destroy our forests with policies and actions that are harmful to humanity and the planet as a whole.Noam SchimmelVisiting associate professor of ethics and international affairs, Elliott School of International Affairs, George Washington University, Washington DC • Your review of the BBC documentary Drowning in Plastic questions our ability to turn the plastic tap off before our oceans become a plastic matrix with some jellyfish embedded (A rallying cry to ditch plastic – but is it too late?, G2, 2 October). We are living in a multidimensional plastic matrix and there is no easy and quick fix. However, the International Solid Waste Association has proposed five steps to turn the plastic tap off. First, we should identify where the leakages and hazards occur, and then prioritise fixing them – there is no need for fancy solutions that are not accountable, like some of those mentioned in the article. Second, plastics and microplastics leakages should be treated like CO2 emissions. We need a global plan and an international agreement to reduce them substantially. The problem can’t be solved locally. Third, microplastics should be considered as hazardous substances, subject to stricter control, and replaced by other materials. Fourth, closing the world’s dump sites, upgrading recycling systems and delivering proper collection services to the developing world is a certain way to prevent marine litter. Fifth, we need to create a new operational system for plastics that will stimulate a surge in plastic resource recovery. Plastic is too convenient and successful. Reducing our dependence on it is the only way ahead. We can only hope that new materials will replace existing plastics, as plastics have replaced so many other materials in so many different uses over the past 65 years. Antonis MavropoulosPresident, International Solid Waste Association • The 38 Degrees campaign for empty non-recyclable crisp packets to be posted back to their manufacturer brought a “crinkly” smile to my face (Don’t post crisp packets without an envelope, begs Royal Mail, 27 September). In the interests of reducing the amount of non-recyclable plastic, why not stop buying crisps and other snack food sold in this type of packaging? This would offer a threefold benefit: saving money; reducing consumption of junk food; and reducing the waste currently going to landfill or, worse, into the water systems. And Royal Mail wouldn’t have to put vehicles on the roads to return the empty packets. If crisp sales were to decline, I wonder how long the manufacturers would take before introducing “smart” packaging? Might I suggest edible packets? They might taste as good as their contents!Steven BennettCharfield, Gloucestershire • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is set up by the UN and the World Meteorological Organisation, bringing together the world’s leading climate scientists to assess knowledge of climate change and provide scientific advice to policymakers.  The First Assessment report from the IPCC shows the climate changes partly owing to natural variability, but that greenhouse gas emissions from human activity play a role, and predicts temperature rises of 0.3C a decade in the 21st century, higher than seen in 10,000 years, and sea level rises of 60cm by 2100. At a major conference in Rio de Janeiro, world governments sign the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, a treaty binding them to “achieve … stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system”, usually shortened to “avoid dangerous climate change”. From this, establishing what level of warming should be classed as “dangerous” and what avoiding this entails, become key questions. The Second Assessment report is published, showing carbon dioxide is the main contributor to warming, and that human actions increasing carbon concentrations in the atmosphere could alter the climate irreversibly.  The Kyoto protocol, an addition to the UNFCCC treaty stipulating cuts in greenhouse gas emissions from developed countries by 2012, is signed. However, the US – then the world’s biggest emitter – fails to ratify the protocol, leaving it in abeyance. It eventually comes into legal force in 2005 after Russia ratifies it. The Third Assessment report is published, showing the world has warmed by 0.6C compared with pre-industrial levels, and in the last 50 years this was mainly due to human activity. The report predicts temperature rises of between 1.4C and 5.8C by 2100, and sea level rises of 0.1 to 0.9 metres. The UK government publishes the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change, led by the former World Bank chief economist Sir Nicholas Stern, showing for the first time that the catastrophic economic impacts of climate change far outstrip the relatively modest costs of reducing emissions. The Fourth Assessment teport is published, showing that warming is “unequivocal” with more than 90% certainty that this comes from human activity. The report confirms that beyond certain levels of warming, effects on the climate become irreversible and in many cases catastrophic, and posits scenarios for a range of estimates of future warming. The mid-range estimate of human-induced warming of about 2C above pre-industrial levels is adopted as the threshold of safety in political decisions on curbing greenhouse gas emissions. The IPCC is awarded the Nobel peace prize for its efforts. Negotiations begin on a new global climate agreement. Governments meet in Copenhagen intending to draft an effective replacement for the Kyoto protocol. Amid bitter political fighting, they sign a partial declaration instead under which for the first time the biggest developed and developing countries agree to emissions curbs. Before the Copenhagen conference, hacked emails appear to show climate scientists manipulating temperature figures, claims that were later rebuffed but which quickly gain notoriety. By early 2010, the “climategate” scandal has spread to the IPCC, with errors found in its 2007 report. Most are small, but one that Himalayan glaciers would disappear by 2035, taken from an unverified report, causes deep embarrassment. The IPCC introduces reforms to ensure such “grey” material is not included in future reports. The Fifth Assessment report is published in stages, showing the 2C threshold will be breached within 30 years without urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Governments sign the Paris agreement, the first fully legally binding international accord requiring all countries to hold global temperature rises to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, with an aspiration to limit rises to 1.5C. Soon after, the IPCC begins work on assessing whether the 1.5C aspiration is feasible, and how to meet it. A supplementary report on 1.5C rises is published, showing the aspiration is feasible but will require tough and urgent action to bring down greenhouse gas emissions. The IPCC will publish its sixth assessment report, drawing together all current knowledge on climate change, its effects and ways to reduce emissions."
"Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, fuelled by the expansion in gas exports and production, according to new figures published by the Department of Environment and Energy. The government quietly published its quarterly emissions figures on Friday afternoon, a public holiday in Victoria and the day of the release of the interim royal commission report into the banking sector.  The figures show that Australia’s policy vacuum on climate continues to drive emissions upward and further away from the country’s Paris targets. The data show emissions climbed 1.3% in the year to March 2018. The March quarter for which the data was published recorded a 0.3% increase. Emissions were up across all sectors except electricity, which fell 4.3% in the year to March, and land use, which the government is continuing to record as a 5.2% carbon sink. Fugitive emissions in the energy sector rose 13.7% in the year to March. The Climate Analytics director, Bill Hare, said the numbers showed Australia was still not on track to meet its Paris commitment to reduce emissions by between 26% and 28% by 2030 from its 2005 levels. “While emissions from the national electricity market continue to decrease due to increasing renewable electricity, Australian emissions as a whole continue to increase,” he said. “On present trends, with virtually no policies apart from the renewable energy target, which will expire in 2020 and not be replaced, emissions are set to gallop way past the Paris agreement target.” He said the figures also showed the decline in per capita emissions was beginning to flatten out “at a time when this should be accelerating”. Matt Drum, the managing director of NDEVR environmental, which tracks emissions and publishes its own quarterly reports months ahead of the government, said the absence of climate policy meant emissions were going up. “All the figures show emissions are increasing because they’ve got no policy,” he said. “What I’m really interested in is what policy is Labor going to reveal in the coming weeks? “The current government have made it very clear they’re not interested in doing anything about emissions.” The chief executive of the Australian Conservation Foundation, Kelly O’Shanassy, said it was “embarrassing” that climate pollution was continuing to rise in a wealthy country like Australia. “This latest pollution scorecard casts extreme doubt over the Morrison government’s claim that Australia will meet our 2030 emissions reduction targets ‘in a canter’ without strong new action. “This latest result is also flattered by falling emissions from power generation, driven by the construction of solar and wind energy under our national renewable energy target. “The Morrison government has declared it will not replace this target after 2020, meaning Australian climate pollution is at risk of growing even further.” The environment minister, Melissa Price, did not respond to questions about the increase in emissions. She said in a statement that emissions were currently 11.2% below 2005 levels. The statement said the latest report on Australia’s national greenhouse gas inventory clearly showed the country was on track to beat its 2020 emissions target."
"Two American economists at the forefront of work on climate change and the role of governments in boosting growth have been jointly awarded the prestigious Nobel Memorial prize for economics. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said William Nordhaus and Paul Romer were being honoured for their research into two of the most “basic and pressing” economic issues of the age. Nordhaus made his name by warning policymakers during the first stirrings of concern about climate change in the 1970s that their economic models were not properly taking account of the impact of global warming and he is seen as one of the pioneers of environmental economics. The Yale economist was honoured a day after the latest UN warning on global warming said that urgent and unprecedented changes were needed to keep climate change to a maximum of 1.5C (2.7F). The co-winner – Romer – is seen as the prime mover behind the endogenous growth theory, the notion that countries can improve their underlying performance if they concentrate on supply-side measures such as research and development, innovation and skills. The New York University economist, who has argued that technological change can be accelerated by the targeted use of state interventions in areas such as R&D tax credits and patent regulation, famously inspired Gordon Brown to use the phrase “post-neoclassical endogenous growth theory” in a speech when he was shadow chancellor. Romer was the chief economist at the World Bank but left after 15 months following repeated run-ins with staff. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said the two men had won the prize – which is not one of those originally instigated by Alfred Nobel – because they had “designed methods for addressing some of our time’s most basic and pressing questions about how we create long-term sustained and sustainable economic growth”. The two men, it continued, had “significantly broadened the scope of economic analysis by constructing models that explain how the market economy interacts with nature and knowledge”. Responding to news of his award, Romer said it was perfectly possible for global warming to be kept to a maximum of 1.5C, in line with the latest recommendation of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. “Once we start to try to reduce carbon emissions, we’ll be surprised that it wasn’t as hard as we anticipated. The danger with very alarming forecasts is that it will make people feel apathetic and hopeless. “One problem today is that people think protecting the environment will be so costly and so hard that they want to ignore the problem and pretend it doesn’t exist. Humans are capable of amazing accomplishments if we set our minds to it.” Per Krusell, one of the panel that awarded the prize, said both men were part of the same agenda, thinking about “long-run, global” issues. Romer and Nordhaus “had similar views about economic policy and market failure, even though superficially they looked different”. Nordhaus has been a prominent advocate of the use of a uniformly applied carbon tax as the best way to put a true cost on the use of burning fossil fuels and so reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The committee that awarded the prize said he was the first person to design “simple but dynamic and quantitative models of the global economic-climate system, now called integrated assessment models (IAMs). “His tools allow us to simulate how the economy and climate would co-evolve in the future under alternative assumptions about the workings of nature and the market economy, including relevant policies.”"
"The former Liberal leader John Hewson has called on voters in his former seat of Wentworth to use the byelection as a referendum on climate change and vote against the Liberals. He suggested it might take “a drubbing” in the byelection on 20 October to force the party he once led to respond to “the urgent challenge” of climate change, and that Liberal voters should consider voting for others before returning to vote Liberal at a general election in six months’ time.  “The community has a unique opportunity now, with a byelection just months before a general election, they could register a substantial protest vote against the government or any other candidates that don’t understand the magnitude and urgency of the climate change challenge,” he told Guardian Australia. “If the Liberal party doesn’t stand up and argue the case on this, I think people should be encouraged to vote against them. “Is it going to take a drubbing in a byelection to get them to do something on climate?” he asked. Hewson led the Liberal party from 1990 to 1994 and has been scathing of the party’s failure to address climate change. The Liberal party’s failure to map out a clear path to achieving the 2030 emissions reduction targets in the Paris agreement was “grossly irresponsible” and amounted to shunting the problem to the next generation, Hewson said. “They think they can just leave it to 2029 but it requires a very large change in the way we do things,” he said. “I get a lot of shit on this, but I am an Australian first and a member of the Liberal party second,” he said. “If I disagree with a Liberal party policy I do my level best to get it changed. It doesn’t mean I am not a Liberal. But to put their head in the sand on this issue – they just fobbed the IPCC report off, like it doesn’t matter – it’s a pretty unsatisfactory position.” The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report released this week warned that the world has only 12 years to keep global warming to a maximum of 1.5C or face dire outcomes. Hewson said the Liberal candidate, Dave Sharma, was “a good candidate” but should be permitted to express some views. “If he has a view he should be able to say he would work within the party, and that would probably get him across the line,” he said. Hewson will join the Adani campaigner and former businessman Geoff Cousins and a coral expert, professor Terry Hughes, at a climate change forum in Bondi on Wednesday night as green groups warn that Wentworth would be markedly hotter and 9% drier by 2050. According to modelling produced for environmental groups campaigning to make climate change the central issue in the byelection, Wentworth faces a future where winter resembles summer temperatures and summer becomes even more extreme. The modelling, which will be used in a social media campaign, is done by the Australian National University using data from the Queensland Department of Environment and Science’s Long Paddock project, which is used to predict climate change impacts in regions and cities. It was commissioned by the Australian Conservation Foundation and is one of a series to be used in the next federal election. The “climate coasters” – visual representations of how the climate will change in key electorates – show the seasonal temperatures now and how they will change by 2050 under the IPCC’s high emissions scenario. This assumes that greenhouse gas emissions continue to grow at the current rate and do not moderate before 2050. The modelling for Wentworth shows that by 2050 the average daily maximum temperatures will be 3C hotter than the historic average (compared to 1960-1990 baseline); there will be twice as many days over 30C; and there will be an average of eight days above 35C. “If we allow runaway climate pollution to continue, Wentworth would keep getting hotter and drier,” the ACF climate change and clean energy program manager, Gavan McFadzean, said. “Summer conditions would take over much of the year and more frequent extreme temperatures would put increased pressure on the health of its more vulnerable residents,” he said. Climate change policy is one of the top issues in the byelection, with candidates aiming to capitalise on the Coalition’s dumping of its proposed national energy guarantee just ahead of dumping the former member for Wentworth and former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull. Turnbull had championed the policy as the way of dealing simultaneously with climate change, energy prices and security of supply, but met with strong resistance from some within his own party. The Coalition has now reverted to the Abbott-era emissions reduction fund as its main policy and is investigating options to prolong the life of coal-fired power plants. High-profile independent Kerryn Phelps has released a six-point plan to tackle climate change and has pledged that if elected she will use her position to push towards 50% renewable energy by 2030. Labor’s Tim Murray is arguing that Labor is the only major party with a comprehensive policy to deal with climate change, and that after the next election it will have the ability to legislate it. Labor is promising to have 50% clean energy by 2030. Several of the other independents and minor parties are also putting forward their plans to tackle climate change."
"Leading climate researchers have overwhelmingly rejected the federal government’s claim it is on track to cut greenhouse gas emissions as promised under the 2015 Paris agreement. Guardian Australia asked economists and scientists, including people who have advised the Coalition and Labor, whether Australia was likely to meet the 2030 target of a 26-28% emissions cut below 2005 levels under existing policy settings, as cabinet ministers have claimed.  The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has repeatedly said the target would be met “in a canter”. Nine of the 12 who responded either dismissed Morrison’s statement outright or strongly suggested new policies would be needed. Only one expressed confidence the target would be met if the government did nothing – and he also criticised the Coalition’s stance. The remaining two said the question was impossible to answer definitively, and that it was a red herring given Australia needed to do much more than it promised in Paris if it was to play its part in limiting global warming to 2C or less. Bill Hare, the Perth-based director of global institute Climate Analytics, said scientific assessment of Australia’s policy settings by the Climate Action Tracker showed there was virtually no chance the target would be met without new policies. “There is absolutely no quantitative scientific basis that I am aware of for the government’s repeated claims that it will meet the Paris agreement target. In fact, the reverse is true – its emissions are likely to continue to increase,” he said. Hare said electricity emissions were falling due to the 2020 renewable energy target but the government had promised not to replace it, and emissions from other sectors of the economy – industry, transport, agriculture – would continue to grow in the absence of comprehensive policies. The Grattan Institute’s energy program director, Tony Wood, said the government’s own published numbers showed it was not on track and if Australia did meet its target it would be more due to good luck than good management. Rather than meeting the target in a canter, he said the government needed “a different horse – or at least to get ready to gallop”. Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick, a senior research associate with the University of New South Wales climate change research centre, highlighted government data showing national emissions rose by 1.3% last year and Department of Environment and Energy projections suggesting emissions would be only 5% below 2005 levels in 2030. “Given that the national energy guarantee [Neg], which would have reduced emissions from the Australian energy sector, has been dumped, there seems to be very few strategies in place,” she said. On Monday the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned in a special report that global warming since pre-industrial times could reach 1.5C by as early as 2030, worsening the risk of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty. The Australian government has rejected the suggestion it should be doing more, and the IPCC’s finding that coal power would effectively need to be phased out by 2050. Asked on the ABC on Tuesday how the government would meet the 2030 target, the environment minister, Melissa Price, listed the Direct Action emissions reduction fund – which has only $250m left of an initial $2.55bn – the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the proposed Snowy 2.0 hydro scheme. The managing director of Frontier Economics, Danny Price, a former adviser to the Coalition on climate policy, was the sole respondent who thought current policies would meet the 2030 target. He said the combination of the renewable energy target, separate federal and state schemes to drive clean energy and reduce electricity use at times of high demand, and the increased cost of power would all contribute. But Danny Price ridiculed the government’s shift from supporting emissions cuts under to the Neg to arguing they were not needed to meet the Paris target. “Why did they knife [Malcolm Turnbull] over a scheme that made no difference? Idiots,” he said. Australia’s chief scientist, Alan Finkel, who last year reviewed the national electricity market for the government, only to see one of his central recommendations – the introduction of a clean energy target – rejected, said the transition to a low-emissions economy would take decades, require action in many sectors and would only happen if public policy adapted. His advice called for a whole-of-economy emissions reduction strategy for 2050 to be put in place by 2020. Finkel suggested the government could meet its Paris commitments but it would require policies to develop further. “I am confident that we will comfortably meet the existing targets in the electricity sector and, with an evolving suite of policy measures, it is possible to meet the whole-of-economy targets as well,” he said. Peter Newman, distinguished professor at Curtin University sustainability policy institute and a lead author of an IPCC chapter on the global response to the climate change threat, said Australia was positioned to make a 26% “in a canter” in two sectors of the economy – electricity and the land, where the government had helped to some degree through reforestation programs. But he said Australia had been slow to move on transport emissions and had a problem with its rapidly growing liquid natural gas industry. Frank Jotzo, research director at the Australian National University Crawford school of public policy, said it was possible Australia could meet an even stronger 2030 target if effective and consistent low-emissions policies were introduced across the economy, but not as things stood. Jotzo was one of four respondents who stressed it was wrong to only consider whether Australia would meet the Coalition’s 2030 target, as it fell short of its share of the Paris climate agreement goal to limit global warming to 2C or less. Turnbull and the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, when environment minister, previously acknowledged Australia would have to adopt more ambitious targets under the Paris deal. Will Steffen, an emeritus professor at ANU’s Fenner school of environment and society and a member of the Climate Council, said the 2030 target was woefully inadequate if Australia was to meet its Paris commitments. “Even meeting that inadequate target – which is not possible under present policy settings – would be consistent with a 3C-plus world, not a 1.5-2C world,” he said. Andy Pitman, director of the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes at UNSW, said asking whether Australia would meet its current 2030 target was a red herring. “An appropriate goal is to decarbonise national economies well before 2050,” he said. Warwick McKibbin, an ANU public policy fellow, senior fellow at the US Brookings Institution and former Reserve Bank of Australia board member, was more cautious than other respondents, warning it was impossible to definitively predict where Australian emissions would go. He said any precise opinion offered in response to the question was more a political statement than rigorous analysis, but added: “What can be said is that a policy with a clear carbon price will make it more likely that Australia will hit its 2030 target.”"
"The world’s leading climate scientists have warned there is only a dozen years for global warming to be kept to a maximum of 1.5C, beyond which even half a degree will significantly worsen the risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people. The authors of the landmark report by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released on Monday say urgent and unprecedented changes are needed to reach the target, which they say is affordable and feasible although it lies at the most ambitious end of the Paris agreement pledge to keep temperatures between 1.5C and 2C. The half-degree difference could also prevent corals from being completely eradicated and ease pressure on the Arctic, according to the 1.5C study, which was launched after approval at a final plenary of all 195 countries in Incheon in South Korea that saw delegates hugging one another, with some in tears. A key finding of the new IPCC report is the dramatic difference that restricting warming to 1.5C above pre industrial levels would have on the global environment. The scientists found: • By 2100, global sea level rise would be 10cm lower with global warming of 1.5C compared with 2C. • Extreme heatwaves will be experienced by 14% of the world's population at least once every five years at 1.5C. But that figure rises to more than a third of the planet if temperatures rise to 2C • Arctic sea ice would remain during most summers if warming is kept to 1.5C. But at 2C, ice free summers are 10 times more likely, leading to greater habitat losses for polar bears, whales, seals and sea birds. • If warming is kept to 1.5C, coral reefs will still decline by 70-90% but if temperatures rise to 2C virtually all of the world's reefs would be lost “It’s a line in the sand and what it says to our species is that this is the moment and we must act now,” said Debra Roberts, a co-chair of the working group on impacts. “This is the largest clarion bell from the science community and I hope it mobilises people and dents the mood of complacency.” Policymakers commissioned the report at the Paris climate talks in 2016, but since then the gap between science and politics has widened. Donald Trump has promised to withdraw the US – the world’s biggest source of historical emissions – from the accord. The first round of Brazil’s presidential election on Sunday put Jair Bolsonaro into a strong position to carry out his threat to do the same and also open the Amazon rainforest to agribusiness. The world is currently 1C warmer than preindustrial levels. Following devastating hurricanes in the US, record droughts in Cape Town and forest fires in the Arctic, the IPCC makes clear that climate change is already happening, upgraded its risk warning from previous reports, and warned that every fraction of additional warming would worsen the impact. Scientists who reviewed the 6,000 works referenced in the report, said the change caused by just half a degree came as a revelation. “We can see there is a difference and it’s substantial,” Roberts said. At 1.5C the proportion of the global population exposed to water stress could be 50% lower than at 2C, it notes. Food scarcity would be less of a problem and hundreds of millions fewer people, particularly in poor countries, would be at risk of climate-related poverty. At 2C extremely hot days, such as those experienced in the northern hemisphere this summer, would become more severe and common, increasing heat-related deaths and causing more forest fires. But the greatest difference would be to nature. Insects, which are vital for pollination of crops, and plants are almost twice as likely to lose half their habitat at 2C compared with 1.5C. Corals would be 99% lost at the higher of the two temperatures, but more than 10% have a chance of surviving if the lower target is reached. Sea-level rise would affect 10 million more people by 2100 if the half-degree extra warming brought a forecast 10cm additional pressure on coastlines. The number affected would increase substantially in the following centuries due to locked-in ice melt. Oceans are already suffering from elevated acidity and lower levels of oxygen as a result of climate change. One model shows marine fisheries would lose 3m tonnes at 2C, twice the decline at 1.5C. Sea ice-free summers in the Arctic, which is warming two to three times faster than the world average, would come once every 100 years at 1.5C, but every 10 years with half a degree more of global warming. The final tick box is political will Time and carbon budgets are running out. By mid-century, a shift to the lower goal would require a supercharged roll-back of emissions sources that have built up over the past 250 years. The IPCC maps out four pathways to achieve 1.5C, with different combinations of land use and technological change. Reforestation is essential to all of them as are shifts to electric transport systems and greater adoption of carbon capture technology. Carbon pollution would have to be cut by 45% by 2030 – compared with a 20% cut under the 2C pathway – and come down to zero by 2050, compared with 2075 for 2C. This would require carbon prices that are three to four times higher than for a 2C target. But the costs of doing nothing would be far higher. “We have presented governments with pretty hard choices. We have pointed out the enormous benefits of keeping to 1.5C, and also the unprecedented shift in energy systems and transport that would be needed to achieve that,” said Jim Skea, a co-chair of the working group on mitigation. “We show it can be done within laws of physics and chemistry. Then the final tick box is political will. We cannot answer that. Only our audience can – and that is the governments that receive it.” He said the main finding of his group was the need for urgency. Although unexpectedly good progress has been made in the adoption of renewable energy, deforestation for agriculture was turning a natural carbon sink into a source of emissions. Carbon capture and storage projects, which are essential for reducing emissions in the concrete and waste disposal industries, have also ground to a halt. Reversing these trends is essential if the world has any chance of reaching 1.5C without relying on the untried technology of solar radiation modification and other forms of geo-engineering, which could have negative consequences. In the run-up to the final week of negotiations, there were fears the text of the report would be watered down by the US, Saudi Arabia and other oil-rich countries that are reluctant to consider more ambitious cuts. The authors said nothing of substance was cut from a text. Bob Ward, of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change, said the final document was “incredibly conservative” because it did not mention the likely rise in climate-driven refugees or the danger of tipping points that could push the world on to an irreversible path of extreme warming. The report will be presented to governments at the UN climate conference in Poland at the end of this year. But analysts say there is much work to be done, with even pro-Paris deal nations involved in fossil fuel extraction that runs against the spirit of their commitments. Britain is pushing ahead with gas fracking, Norway with oil exploration in the Arctic, and the German government wants to tear down Hambach forest to dig for coal. At the current level of commitments, the world is on course for a disastrous 3C of warming. The report authors are refusing to accept defeat, believing the increasingly visible damage caused by climate change will shift opinion their way. “I hope this can change the world,” said Jiang Kejun of China’s semi-governmental Energy Research Institute, who is one of the authors. “Two years ago, even I didn’t believe 1.5C was possible but when I look at the options I have confidence it can be done. I want to use this report to do something big in China.” The timing was good, he said, because the Chinese government was drawing up a long-term plan for 2050 and there was more awareness among the population about the problem of rising temperatures. “People in Beijing have never experienced so many hot days as this summer. It’s made them talk more about climate change.” Regardless of the US and Brazil, he said, China, Europe and major cities could push ahead. “We can set an example and show what can be done. This is more about technology than politics.” James Hansen, the former Nasa scientist who helped raised the alarm about climate change, said both 1.5C and 2C would take humanity into uncharted and dangerous territory because they were both well above the Holocene-era range in which human civilisation developed. But he said there was a huge difference between the two: “1.5C gives young people and the next generation a fighting chance of getting back to the Holocene or close to it. That is probably necessary if we want to keep shorelines where they are and preserve our coastal cities.” Johan Rockström, a co-author of the recent Hothouse Earth report, said scientists never previously discussed 1.5C, which was initially seen as a political concession to small island states. But he said opinion had shifted in the past few years along with growing evidence of climate instability and the approach of tipping points that might push the world off a course that could be controlled by emissions reductions. “Climate change is occurring earlier and more rapidly than expected. Even at the current level of 1C warming, it is painful,” he told the Guardian. “This report is really important. It has a scientific robustness that shows 1.5C is not just a political concession. There is a growing recognition that 2C is dangerous.”"

"If you don’t fully appreciate the complexity of rural communities, farmer Peter Schmidt is not the sort of bloke you would be expecting in the Mulga Lands. His place is 21,000 hectares – 52,000 acres in the old money – and his family have been there since his grandfather selected blocks in the 1890s. The closest town is Wyandra, a blip on the highway on the way to Cunnamulla from Charleville – a drive that reveals the disused fences of smaller blocks long abandoned as unsustainable. Schmidt though is still at his homestead at Alawoona, its sheds and outbuildings surrounded by a metre-high levee, standing like a bad joke in their sixth year of drought. He put it in after the 2012 flood, which washed a foot of water through his house. Problem is, that flood heralded the start of the dry and it pretty much hasn’t rained since. He jokes with station hand Joe that he cursed the place and might have to break the levee to bring on the rain. But far from being a man of superstition, Schmidt is a rural scientist, with two masters degrees – one each in rural education and cattle behaviour. He has a softly spoken manner and a sense of humour born in the Mulga. “We’re mad here, we are in the most unreliable area, the most unreliable climate in the most unreliable continent,” he says. “Well, it’s unreliably reliable,” says his partner, Kathryn. Schmidt first started thinking about climate change after seeing a program on the astronaut Neil Armstrong who, before he went to space, thought the earth’s atmosphere was like the peel of an orange. In the pictures of space, Schmidt could see that the thickness of the atmosphere was more like an onion skin, and it stayed with him. “I kept that in the back of my mind and then you hear things like there’s a million new cars put on the road every year in Australia belching out exhaust fumes – and these coal-fired things – something has to happen in that very confined space of the atmosphere. I think it’s happening.” It is the middle of winter when we drop in, and though the fine day stretches over the place like a shroud, there is a chilly wind that blows through the mulga. Schmidt welcomes us into a small closed kitchen as he loads some old gidgee (Acacia cambagei or stinking wattle) into the wood stove and offers us a coffee. Schmidt has lived through many droughts but it’s the big ones he remembers – 1958, 1965, 1983. While southern Australia suffered through the Millennium drought during the noughties, up in the Mulga Lands, Schmidt says it was “dry for eight years in a row”. Every one is different but this time Schmidt has noticed one change from previous droughts has been the higher temperature. “The essential thing was there were two or three periods there where the temperature was above 40C for 15 days in a row and it just sapped all the moisture out of the soil,” Schmidt says. “That’s the difference between this drought and the others.” He had 100mm on the backblocks of his place last November, 59mm in March and very little since then. Drought has long been a part of the Australian climate and features in Indigenous stories and history. Indigenous agricultural and land management practices, documented by historians such as Bruce Pascoe and Bill Gammage, consider drought as a subjective notion – that is, it’s a state of mind. This is replicated among today’s landholders, reflected back in comments like these: “the only thing we know about drought is that it will end”. That is, it is a period that needs to be managed, like any other. We will explore more of this thinking about drought in the last of this series. Then there is the scientific definition of drought. According to the Bureau of Meterology, drought is serious or severe rainfall deficiency – essentially a period of prolonged dryness. By this measure, south-west Queensland has experienced almost seven years of dry times. Yet when Guardian Australia visited the region, locals were keen to reject some commonly held assumptions. Drought is not uniform. Parts of Queensland have been in drought for seven years but it does not mean those communities have not had any rain. Drought doesn’t stop with one rainfall. Even in NSW, which is 100% drought-declared, some areas are not strictly in drought. Each region responds differently to drought and has different assets and challenges. All of the community is affected by drought, not just farmers. Businesses, shops and social events can close down as people hunker down and stop spending. Not every farmer is male – businesses are mostly partnerships – and not every farmer is on her last legs. Many farmers have taken advantage of rain when it does come, by making hay and stockpiling other fodder. Many are careful to protect their pastures and therefore their soil by selling or locking up livestock and feeding – a practice known as drought lotting – in dry times. Others over-graze and accelerate land degradation. This explains why driving through the countryside you can see one side of a fence is as bare as a board and the other with foot-high pasture. And yet, no matter how much you prepare, it is hard to manage for seven lean years with a business, bills to pay and an average farm debt. Land management is key. “It’s so much easier to be a good manager in a wet year,” Augathella farmer Rachelle Cameron says. “There is grass everywhere and no stress.” Four hours north of Wyandra, Louise and Andrew (Marto) Martin are sheep growers on the Mitchell Grass plains near Tambo, 860kms north-west of Brisbane. Looking out over the high grass, it doesn’t look too bad, certainly not the desert landscape pictures that metropolitan audiences are used to in drought. Macfarlane station is on an ancient inland sea – the Martin’s fossil collection contains ammonites and Huon pine, spat out of the black soil plains that expand and contract depending on the water content. Both Martins work the farm, while Andrew is also mayor of the Blackall-Tambo region. This year they got a bit of autumn rain and made 200 bales of hay. They reduced their stocking rate to match the season, as much as is possible with lambing ewes. They’re not in favour of what Marto calls “agrarian socialism”, believing that subsidies create dependency. “The best way of dealing with drought is accepting you are going to have one,” Andrew says.  He takes the longer view on climate, which he describes as always changing, while Louise echoes Schmidt’s experience that higher temperatures have been a feature of the latest drought. “It’s quite unusual to get over 40C here but this last summer and the last couple of summers have been so scorchingly hot,” she says. “You can see the water being sucked out of the dams, sucked out of the soil, sucked out of my life and you can’t plan for that. “The way to plan for drought is you just have to make a decision and if you haven’t got enough grass, you sell [stock].” Karen and Bill McLennan and their son Michael are in the Mulga Lands on the highway to Roma, just outside Charleville. Their diversification plan was an olive plantation – Sommariva Olives – made into oil, soap, tapenades and other products. They are trying to stay agile, in the government’s words, to drought-proof. Bill and Karen also work in the panel-beating business in Charleville through the week; they spread themselves thin in an effort to survive the climate and the conditions. Karen describes the good times, when the grass is above their knees, but looking out from their back deck off the olive shed, it is all mulga and red dirt. The olives get enough water to yield a crop every second year. She describes a life that is filled with work, in the panel shop, in the olive shed, in the mulga. The olives were to be the retirement plan, but their oil won awards and it has increased the cashflow in dry times. “You do get a bit sick of it, she says. “You often say, I want to get out. I have had enough, I just want to get out. But you can’t really sell when it’s this dry, you have to wait for the rain, and then hopefully, if you want to get out, you get out then when it looks nice. But probably everyone else thinks the same way so the market will be flooded.” They find government policies frustrating, the rhetoric encouraging farmers to diversify while erecting hurdles, or as Michael says, “government policy is actually adverse to diversification, it’s crazy”. Karen applied for some assistance to restructure their finances and was knocked back on account of their income from the panel-beating shop. “Like my husband says, when we are in drought, this whole area is in drought,” she says. “Our business in town struggles as well, because people can’t spend money in town. We get hit there as well as out here.” Pressure has increased on the family after the bank revalued their properties and stock as a result of the downturn in conditions, which changes the interest payments. Like all the farmers we speak to, they appreciate the city’s donations, though they have not received anything. Hay is tricky, given once you start feeding cattle, you have to keep going. One or two bales will not last long. One of the big movements in farming practice over recent years is towards grazing practices that respond to climate rather than keeping a set number of stock no matter what the climate. There are a number of farmers now who sell down stock and close down for dry periods but this requires a certain equity level. For the McLennans, it is not an option. It’s easy to say you need to destock going into a drought – but you can’t “It’s easy to say you need to destock going into a drought, but you can’t,” Michael says. “The cost of getting into one of these places, you have to keep producing because if you don’t, how do you meet your loans? What is your income? In drought, costs go up, but cattle prices go down because no one else can buy for the next year.” North west of the McLennans, Doug and Rachelle Cameron live on the old station of Nive Downs, originally over 738 square miles with its own post office and general store. It was split up in the 1960s and the couple have been on 34,000 acres north of Augathella since 2004. Conditions were pretty good for the first few years, then it flooded before sliding into drought. They have cut their herd down from 1,300 to 900 and are preparing for the possibility they will not get their usual summer rain. In a normal year, the Cameron family gets 19 inches of annual rainfall on Nive Downs, yet near the end of August they have only had six. Talk turns to what normal is. “The new norm seems to be drier and hotter over the years we have been here, with our average summer temperatures,” Rachelle says. “I wouldn’t say [climate change] is not happening. It seems to be all or nothing in the country.” The Camerons are trying to increase cash flow by diversifying into production of their Nive Beef jerky. Doug hit on it after a cattle price crash due to the 2011 temporary live export ban. At a roadhouse on the way back from the saleyards, he saw a 25g packet of beef jerky for $5 after he just sold cattle for $50 a head. Doug was sick of being a price taker. “It didn’t matter what I did to the cattle – we could have the best genetics, the best everything – but outside influences just crushed us. I thought maybe we can make something out of the jerky and set the price.” Around Augathella, they grow their haystack in summer and cattle eat it down in winter. By autumn, they know whether they will have enough feed to get through the winter, and for the past five years it has never been enough, so they have sold off cattle. “This year is worse than every other year. We are missing all that growth, lately it’s been late rain, with a [short] eight-week window to grow before it cools out. You are not getting bulk feed through and that’s what hurt us in the community.” Farmers are not the only ones to suffer in drought. Dave* lost his job on a big cotton farm in a small northern NSW town when the drought started to bite. There was not enough water and the farmer cut back his cropping program. Like many farm workers, a cottage was part of his package. So when he lost his job, Dave and wife Margie* also lost their house. There was no redundancy package because the employer was not large enough. Dave was reeling from the job loss but Margie got active. The couple, in their late 50s, were carrying a bit of debt from the last drought when they were left unpaid for contracting work. So while looking for a new home, Margie also contacted their bank to apply for hardship provisions which the bank duly provided. But when a good friend gave them some money to tide them over, the bank dropped the hardship provision. Margie applied to Centrelink for Newstart, but given the couple have had various micro businesses, the application process was arduous to prove they had no hidden assets. She also contacted high profile drought charities who told her because they were not farmers, they could not help. Sixteen weeks after losing their job and home, they were still waiting for Newstart. The only assistance they have received is from the Country Womens Association, which pays up to $3000 for household expenses such as fuel, power, insurance and the like. Another city based charity arrived with groceries, lining up donated goods like a supermarket at a local hall. “The government needs to look after people who become unemployed with the drought,” Margie said. “There is no focus on contractors, the small businesses, it’s hard to get Centrelink assistance and those people end up leaving town.” The dry weather also places pressure on regular social events such as picnic races, campdrafts and other gatherings, which are important economically and socially. At a time when people need to keep an eye on others, the usual events can disappear from a town calendar, having a material effect on the state of mind of its inhabitants. Christine McDougall is the director for mental health, alcohol and other drugs for the South West Hospital and Health Service under the Queensland government. Based in Roma, her patch is one of the largest health services in the state, covering 320,000 square kilometres, but there are only 29,000 people scattered across that vast “corner country”. McDougall has been a mental health nurse since 1974 but she says it makes her cry to drive around Charleville and Cunnamulla and see the effect on the community, first of the floods of 2012, which wrecked the soil and land, and now the latest drought. There are no mental health beds in the south west, and people are transported by the Royal Flying Doctors Service if necessary. The service aims to keep people in their own community, using local hospitals and providing full support as much as possible, via telehealth consultations and regular visits by clinicians. “We try to keep as many people as we can out here because it’s traumatic going into hospital in an aeroplane,” says McDougall. “We can’t make it rain but we can keep them going until it rains – we hope – and if they get the money from the government and all these donations coming, we can keep the social and emotional stuff going.” A straight-talking dairy farmer’s daughter from Gippsland in Victoria, she presses the point that women are farmers too. “People think of farmers and they have an image of a man; you ask women what they do and they say we are farmers. They know everything that is happening on the place. They are as likely to get as depressed, miserable or suicidal as the next man.” Three years ago the state government created positions for Regional Adversity Integrated Care Clinicians (Raiccs) to cope with drought and disaster. The approach was to get to as many people as possible, no matter how remote and no matter how few people turn up. The number of suicides has dropped in the region from 13 to 4 over the past two years. “I have not forgotten anyone I have looked after who has taken their life by suicide, you never forget them, and you always think what if I had done this or that – you don’t know,” she says. “We have to acknowledge too we never know the ones we stop. It’s no small thing to go from 13 to 4, given the way it ripples through the community.” If you need support call Lifeline on 131114 *names have been changed"
"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has told world leaders that they have a moral obligation to act on climate change and only 12 years in which to do it (Global warming must not exceed 1.5C, landmark UN report warns, 8 October). We must ramp up the noise until the Trump administration and their Congressional enablers hear. The first order of business should be a revenue-neutral carbon tax, preferably one that is returned to taxpayers. Former Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen says such a tax is a “no-brainer”, and many other highly respected economists agree. Beyond that and other measures to go green, America must rejoin the global community and re-assume leadership to prevent climate catastrophe. We will succeed or fail together. Only through cooperation with other nations and helping them to cut their carbon emissions can we succeed.

"In Mike Judge’s 2006 comedy, Idiocracy, the participants in an ill-fated cryogenics experiment awake 500 years in the future to discover that due to dysgenic mutation, anti-intellectualism and corporate capitalism the intelligence of the population has fallen to dangerous levels. The president is sponsored by fast-food chain Carl’s Jr., and crops are failing because the fields are irrigated with energy drinks. The film was abandoned by its studio and largely ignored at the box office, but its subsequent cult status might be in danger once again, this time from the overbearing reality of present events. Researchers from Beijing University and Yale School of Health published research last month showing that people who live in major cities – which is, today, most of us – are not only suffering from increases in respiratory illnesses and other chronic conditions due to air pollution, but are losing our cognitive functions. The study showed that high pollution levels lead to significant drops in test scores in language and arithmetic, with the impact on some participants equivalent to losing several years of education. Other studies have shown that high air pollution is linked to premature birth, low birth weight, mental illness in children and dementia in the elderly. We’re only just beginning to understand how the air we breathe affects not just our physical environment, but our mental capacity as well. And the air we breathe is changing in the long term, as well as the short. Rising carbon dioxide levels – the main driver of climate change – aren’t just a hazard to the earth and other living creatures, they’re also affecting our thinking. At higher levels, CO2 clouds the mind: it makes us slower and less likely to develop new ideas, it degrades our ability to take in new information, change our minds, or formulate complex thoughts. Global atmospheric CO2 levels passed 400 parts per million in 2016, and despite global agreements to keep runaway climate change under control, little action has been taken. The very worst-case scenario – AKA business as usual, which is the track we’re on – predicts atmospheric CO2 concentration of 1,000ppm by 2100. At 1,000ppm, human cognitive ability drops by 21%. This isn’t merely a problem for the future – as if that would make it better. As we come to understand more about the effects of CO2, we have been measuring more of it, and finding that as it increases outside, it increases inside, too. Outdoor CO2 already reaches 500ppm regularly in industrial cities; indoors, in poorly ventilated homes or school workplaces, it can regularly exceed 1,000ppm. A study of bedrooms in Denmark found that overnight concentrations of CO2 exceeded 2,000ppm, with measurable effects on student’s performance the following day. Schools in California and Texas, when measured in 2012, regularly exceeded 2,000ppm in the daytime. And the kind of “green” insulation used to improve the heat retention of buildings – a climate change mitigation process – also raises the levels of CO2 trapped inside. Even if we meet the most stringent targets set at the Paris agreements in 2015, 2100 will bring atmospheric CO2 levels of 660ppm – with around a 15% decrease in average brainpower. It’s possibly one of the most tragic ironies of the whole sorry business that climate change is making it harder for us to think, just when we need new and bold ideas to deal with its effects. Rather than taking action to mitigate this process, we find case and case again of companies actively trying to increase emissions. Volkswagen notoriously spent years creating complex, embedded software to bypass emissions tests, with the result that cars certified for use in the US actually emitted nitrogen oxide at 40 times the legal limit. In Europe, where the same “defeat devices” were found, and where thousands more of the vehicles were sold, it’s been estimated that 1,200 people will die a decade earlier due to VW’s emissions – and many more, as we now know, will have cognitive difficulties. It’s hard not to see an allegory between Volkswagen’s manipulation of opaque technologies and the ways in which we are being manipulated more broadly by the largely unaccountable systems we engage with every day. Multiple studies have shown that the way in which social media regulates our information intake for profit leaves us more divided, less politically aware, and increasingly prejudiced and violent. YouTube recently suggested I should follow an archive clip of US anchorman Walter Cronkite warning about climate change all the way back in 1980, with a 30-minute conspiracy lecture titled How the Global Warming Scare Began. Mental pollution comes in many forms. The US Environmental Protection Agency announced recently that it was reconsidering Obama-era rules governing the emission of mercury from coal-fired power plants. Symptoms of mercury poisoning include emotional instability, insomnia, reduced cognitive function and memory loss. It was the use of mercury to stiffen hat brims that caused an epidemic of dementia among milliners in the 18th and 19th centuries, the origin of the phrase “mad as a hatter”. It’s hard to think of a measure better tuned to cancelling the future than raising the amount of mercury in the environment, or an act more in keeping with our times than intentionally increasing the recklessness, forgetfulness and stupidity of the population. But then those in charge of our affairs currently have their own chemical load to shed. Since the 1980s, one common pollutant we have managed to curtail is lead, mostly by excluding it from paint, plumbing and petrol. As a result there has been a 4.5-point rise in IQ points in those born after 1985. Those who grew up in Europe and North America between 1965 and 1985 – the cohort who are running things right now – were regularly found to be carrying 20 micrograms per decilitre levels of lead in their bloodstream, which can lead to far greater levels of long-term cognitive impairment than those reported in studies of contemporary air pollution. If you want one simple explanation for the wildly differing political attitudes between current generations, and some of the irrational paths we seem hellbent on taking at present, you could do worse than take lead poisoning into account. Brain damage, it seems, is the one thing the baby boomers are willing to pass on to their kids. • James Bridle is the author of New Dark Age: Technology and the End of the Future"
"The new 1.5C report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is a sophisticated intelligence briefing on the fate of our planet. Its message is relevant to every human being on Earth. Based on more than 6,000 scientific studies, the report was compiled by more than 80 of the world’s top climate scientists from nearly 40 countries, and calibrates 40,000 peer-review comments. It is a robust and outstanding example of international cooperation, and an extraordinary source of shared intelligence.  With brutal clarity the report covers the devastating consequences of allowing global warming to reach 2C above pre-industrial levels. It makes clear that every fraction of a degree truly matters. A key finding of the new IPCC report is the dramatic difference that restricting warming to 1.5C above pre industrial levels would have on the global environment. The scientists found: • By 2100, global sea level rise would be 10cm lower with global warming of 1.5C compared with 2C. • Extreme heatwaves will be experienced by 14% of the world's population at least once every five years at 1.5C. But that figure rises to more than a third of the planet if temperatures rise to 2C • Arctic sea ice would remain during most summers if warming is kept to 1.5C. But at 2C, ice free summers are 10 times more likely, leading to greater habitat losses for polar bears, whales, seals and sea birds. • If warming is kept to 1.5C, coral reefs will still decline by 70-90% but if temperatures rise to 2C virtually all of the world's reefs would be lost When compared to the impacts of a 2C temperature increase, limiting warming to 1.5C (we are already at 1C) would significantly reduce the risk of severe and extreme weather events, particularly heatwaves and heat-related mortality. It would halve the number of humans that will be exposed to water scarcity; prevent runaway sea level rise that could put many of the world’s islands under water and render uninhabitable the large delta and low-coastal regions that are home to two-thirds of the world’s population. It would prevent the almost total loss of the world’s beautiful coral reefs, protect economic growth and be far less expensive to manage. There is nothing opaque about this new data. The illustrations of mounting impacts, the fast-approaching and irreversible tipping points are visceral visions of a future that no policymaker could wish to usher in or be responsible for. Most striking to me, therefore, is the fact that the determinants of whether we head for 2C or for 1.5C are mainly political; they are not technical or economic. We are already at the beginning of a global, exponential shift in the way we produce electricity – away from fossil fuels to the abundant sources of sun and wind. Since the Paris agreement was signed in 2015, the price of large-scale solar and wind energy has fallen so far it is now much cheaper in many jurisdictions than coal. Renewables are expected to outcompete fossil fuels as a new electricity source in almost every market by 2020. Electrification of transport is about to hit its exponential increase curve and cities will be transformed. Not all sectors are seeing the same transformation yet, but the additional investment required to limit warming to 1.5C is far from overwhelming – nearly $1tn annually from now to 2050. The recent New Climate Economy report shows that those investments will not only protect us from devastating impacts, they will deliver $26tn in economic benefits by 2030 – and that is a conservative estimate. It is therefore both morally inexcusable and economically irresponsible to allow investment to continue to flow towards the further exploration of fossil fuels, rather than be intentionally directed at technologies and infrastructure that are in the solutions space. Driven by the pursuit of clean air, new jobs, improved transport and competitive advantage, the recent Global Climate Action Summit evidenced the growing appetite of businesses, investors, cities and states to intensify their own climate action, as well as their support for national governments to send stronger signals. Efforts to deliver positive change are inexorably marching in the right direction, but we still have an acute need for speed, radical collaboration, and more visionary political leadership. Emissions reductions today are much more important than emissions reductions tomorrow: the sooner we bend the global curve of emissions, the more options we will have on the table for safely reaching the necessary, desirable and achievable carbon neutrality by 2050. National governments have the evidence base and the opportunity now to set their economies quickly on that curve. This year, nations will start the review of their original Paris commitments from 2015 as they prepare to come back to the table with increased ambition in 2020. The review process will include assessing the burgeoning suite of solutions now available to them. Many of these solutions, like the increasingly competitive price of renewables, the extraordinary technological gains in back-up energy storage, and the rapid emergence of electric vehicles, that are part of our reality now, were unthinkable just three years ago. It is no surprise, therefore, that China, India and the EU appear to be ahead of their Paris targets, and are well placed to be frontrunners in upping their commitments in 2020. We are also seeing the formidable leadership of climate vulnerable nations such as Fiji and the Marshall Islands, who have already committed to increasing their Paris targets by 2020. Let us not forget that it was the foresight of the most vulnerable nations which introduced the 1.5C aspirational ceiling in the Paris agreement. Now we all have the information we need – and a better understanding of the overwhelming benefits – to move forward together to stay under that ceiling. On climate change, ignorance is not bliss. Quite the contrary. I encourage all policy makers to undertake a thorough review of how much has been achieved thanks to the signal they provided in Paris, and to garner the courage to provide much bolder signals now. I encourage corporations and financial institutions to assess the risk they precipitate by not decarbonising their products, services and investment portfolios. And I encourage all of those individuals who have the privilege and democratic right to vote, to understand the evidence presented by the IPCC today, to act in their personal lives and to vote responsibly. We have a safer, more prosperous future to win. • Christiana Figueres was head of the UN’s climate body for six years, including for the 2015 Paris agreement"
"Nicola Sturgeon’s government needs much tougher policies on cutting emissions from Scotland’s roads and farms to meet its ambitious CO2 reduction targets, experts have warned. The UK government’s committee on climate change (CCC) said the Scottish National party government was well on track to hit its 2020 target to cut emissions by 56%, reducing them faster than the UK as a whole. However, that was largely because of substantial gains from the closure of Scotland’s last coal-fired power station at Longannet in Fife in 2016 and gains from cutting CO2 emissions from waste, which were relatively easy things to achieve.  While emissions from energy plummeted, transport emissions had barely fallen and made up more than a third of Scotland’s overall emissions of 41.5m tonnes’ equivalent of CO2 (MtC2e) in 2016. To achieve Scotland’s post-2020 target to cut emissions by 66% by 2032 and by 90% by 2050, that volume of transport emissions needed to be cut heavily. “Transport is now Scotland’s biggest sectoral challenge,” the committee’s annual report to the Scottish parliament said. “The Scottish government’s ambition is good but we need to see much more action, particularly on road transport, if Scotland is to achieve more rapid emissions reductions than the rest of the UK.” The CCC said ministers should: • consider free parking and special lanes for electric cars• set targets for cutting nitrogen fertilisers in farming• plough more money into planting new forests to soak up CO2 • set much tougher energy efficiency and low carbon heating standards in new homes. Sturgeon said last year she wanted to see sales of new petrol and diesel cars end in Scotland by 2032, eight years earlier than the UK government target. The CCC said it saw little evidence that the 2032 target would be met. Sturgeon announced last month another £15m towards electric charging points for cars and £20m for a low carbon loans fund. She has said the A9 trunk road from Perth to Scrabster would become the UK’s longest “electric highway” with regular roadside charging points. Even so, sales of ultra-low emission cars have been consistently slower in Scotland than in the rest of the UK. The latest UK government data shows 7,700 ULEV cars were sold in Scotland in the first three months of 2018 compared with 130,000 in England, or about 4,000 less than Scotland’s population share. Supported by new funding, Scotland is catching up on low emission buses. Data from the Low Carbon Vehicle Partnership shows 12% of Scotland’s bus fleet is low carbon, including 10 hydrogen-powered buses operating in Aberdeen, compared with 16% in England and only 2% in Wales. However, bus travel is falling in Scotland, dropping by 10% over the past five years, while private car use is continuing to grow. Train travel is up but so too is aviation. Tom Ballantine, the chairman of the umbrella group Stop Climate Chaos Scotland, said MSPs at Holyrood should amend the new climate bill going through the Scottish parliament to toughen up policy. “This new independent report is clear that we need decisive and urgent action to keep Scotland’s climate change emissions falling rapidly,” he said. “Science is telling us we need to act faster. We are starting to see the serious effects of wilder weather, with droughts and heatwaves close to home and around the world this year.” A Scottish government spokesman said they welcomed the CCC’s confirmation it was on track to hit its emissions reductions target but he did not respond in detail to the committee’s recommendations.   “The committee’s report shows Scotland continues to lead the UK in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and that we have met our statutory emission reduction target for the third successive year,” he said. “We will continue to look at what more we can do to address climate change and will consider the report’s recommendations carefully.”"
"The world is failing to combat the threat of climate change. Global carbon dioxide emissions from coal, oil and gas increased by 1.6% in 2017, after three years when they rose little or not at all. Demand for oil is increasing by around 1.5% a year. Last week one of the authors of a key United Nations climate report warned that governments are “nowhere near on track” to meeting their commitment, made in Paris three years ago, to avoid global warming of more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. When it is unveiled next week, the report from the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) will give a clearer idea of the probable consequences of this failure. One recent study suggested the impact of a temperature rise of 2C could be more severe than previously thought, and include sea level rises of six metres once the climate has stabilised. That would be several metres higher than climate models currently predict could happen by 2100. The relationship between climate change and specific weather events is complex, but modelling suggests global warming made this summer’s European heatwave twice as likely. The increased frequency and severity of tropical storms fit with longstanding predictions that warmer oceans will bring more chaotic weather.  Slowing the rise in temperature means taking steps towards decarbonisation that are more dramatic than anything achieved so far, such as the eradication of emissions from cars and air travel. Activists are hugely important in raising public awareness. So it was disappointing that three environmental activists were sentenced to between 15 and 16 months in jail for their part in a protest against fracking in Lancashire. This punishment, for causing a public nuisance, is unduly harsh and disproportionate. The 2008 Climate Change Act, committing the UK to an 80% reduction in emissions by 2050, was a world-leading piece of legislation. Now the advisory Committee on Climate Change says we are on track to miss legally binding targets, and that this looming failure is partly attributable to government. As well as transport emissions and the removal of incentives for insulation, it has raised concerns about the regulation of fracking. Fracking – or shale gas extraction – is unpopular in England (it is banned in France and Scotland). Campaigners are also opposing government proposals to smooth the planning process for frackers. We do not advocate breaking the law. But when the news on climate change is so alarming, the commitment of green activists around the world is one reason for hope. The UN’s role in leading and coordinating multilateral action is also crucial. The crisis surrounding its environment chief, Erik Solheim, is all the more unfortunate given the timing. Questions over his $488,513 travel expenses, and his wife’s position at a company that has a contract with the UN, must be resolved as a matter of urgency. Governments must also start to take seriously suggestions such as the one made by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, that if the US eventually quits the Paris climate accord, other countries should refuse to trade with it. Donald Trump’s administration is a threat to global stability. Last week it emerged Trump officials argued that because global temperatures, on current trends, will be 4C higher by 2100, the US should not bother doing anything to inhibit global warming but instead ought to loosen restrictions on carbon emissions. This is absurd nihilism. Mr Trump needs to be convinced of his wrongheadedness, for the world’s sake. The UN’s report is expected to say it will be extremely difficult to meet the 1.5C goal – but not impossible. We should all hold on to that idea. • This article was amended on 4 October 2018. An earlier version said that a recent study suggested the impact of a temperature rise of 2C could include “sea level rises of six metres by 2100.” That study suggested a six metre rise, but on millennial timescales, not by 2100. In addition, an earlier version referred to a rise of 7C, when 4C was meant. This has been corrected."
"After smoking and drink-driving, could climate change provide the next big behaviour-change challenge? The latest science tells us that nothing short of rapid, transformative change in our infrastructure and behaviour can prevent the loss of the climate we depend on – yet the message is only now being officially endorsed at the highest scientific level, because the implications are terrifying for today’s political and economic gatekeepers. It means real change, which incumbents always fear. But are we better at society-wide changes in attitude and behaviour than we give ourselves credit for? And do recent cultural shifts relating to everything from diet to plastics, sexism and attitudes to gender and identity suggest that we might be entering a phase in which more rapid behavioural changes are possible? Research in a new report for a soon-to-be launched international alliance of concerned groups suggests so.  The really big behaviour changes need to be seen first and most among the populations of the high-consuming, wealthier countries. In recent decades most of these have built up experience of how to achieve behaviour change by tackling several public health crises. Today in the UK fewer than one in five adults still smoke and rates have fallen sharply even in the past five years. But in the early 1970s, more than half of men and over 40% of women smoked. It’s a huge success against the odds concerning a highly addictive product, promoted by a powerful industry that knew about, but publicly denied, knowledge of the harm it caused. Comparisons are close and disturbing with oil companies like ExxonMobil, which was aware of climate change as early as 1977. Change was achieved with a comprehensive approach of awareness raising, tough regulation, pricing and support. Dangerous driving and drink-driving is another example. Car use in the UK was 20 times higher in 2016 compared with 1949, but the risk of being injured or killed fell almost every year from 1949, from 165 deaths for every billion miles driven, to only 5.4 such deaths in 2015. To achieve that change meant challenging people’s perceptions of risk about their own behaviour, raising awareness of the resulting harm to self and others, persuading people to leave their cars at home and take different forms of transport if they planned to drink, and changes to vehicles themselves and the physical driving environment. Other examples of successful behaviour change can be found in responses to the HIV/Aids crisis, the dangers of an unhealthy diet and antibiotic resistance. These examples all provide grounds for hope – but there are signs that something else is happening that might bring even faster shifts in attitude and behaviour closer to what is needed to meet vital climate targets. A mixture of new social movements and social media now seem capable of transforming gradual background shifts into defining moments of change. They reveal that while change can take decades, these days new social norms can become established almost overnight. From the shift around single-use plastics, to the #MeToo movement and the rise of the vegan diet, things are moving fast. The male-only charity fundraiser went out of business following a single investigative report by the Financial Times into the Presidents Club scandal. Likewise, the tide turned rapidly against male-only conference panels once they began to be named and shamed online. Things change. It’s the one thing that is reliable. The climate is changing faster than the attitudes and behaviour of the people most responsible for causing its disruption – but we now know enough to speed things up if we choose to. After a summer of lethal, extreme weather events, it is also becoming clear that disruption of the climate is a public health issue on a much grander scale than smoking or drink-driving. Rapid shifts in how we live, work and run the economy have to be made. We should be optimistic that changing our behaviour – to the extent required – is possible. • Andrew Simms is an author, analyst and campaigner.

"The Australian government has rejected the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report’s call to phase out coal power by 2050, claiming renewable energy cannot replace baseload coal power. The deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, said Australia should “absolutely” continue to use and exploit its coal reserves, despite the IPCC’s dire warnings the world has just 12 years to avoid climate change catastrophe. He said the government would not change policy “just because somebody might suggest that some sort of report is the way we need to follow and everything that we should do”. The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, also did not commit to the total phase-out of coal, but called for more renewable energy. Since the former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull abandoned the emissions reduction component of the Coalition’s national energy guarantee, Australia has been left without a policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions beyond 2020, when the renewable energy target will expire. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has claimed Australia will meet its Paris climate agreement targets of reducing emissions by 26% to 28% on 2005 levels by 2030 “in a canter”. The claim is contradicted by environment department figures showing emissions are rising and advice from the Energy Security Board that Australia will fall short under a business-as-usual scenario. The IPCC report held particularly sobering news for Australia, that holding warming to 1.5C rather than 2C would probably be the difference between the survival of some Great Barrier Reef coral and its complete decline. On Monday McCormack told Sky News coalmining was “very, very important” because it provided 60% of Australia’s electricity, 50,000 jobs and was Australia’s “largest export”. Iron ore will be Australia’s biggest exporter earner in 2018-19. McCormack said he “understands the concerns” expressed in the IPCC report, but admitted he hadn’t read it yet. “I’ll certainly consider what it has to say. But the fact is, coalmining … and coal-fired power stations do play an important part of our energy mix in Australia and will do so going forward.” The deputy prime minister said that he hadn’t “seen anything that’s going to replace coal in the near future”, predicting it would be an important part of the energy mix “for more than just 10 years”. “The Liberals and Nationals in government are supportive of small business, of industry, of farms, and of coalmining.” The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg – who as energy and environment minister championed a policy to reduce emissions by 26% in the electricity sector – warned that without coal “the lights will go out on the east coast of Australia”. The environment minister, Melissa Price, said the IPCC report was designed to inform policymakers but was not “policy ­prescriptive”. On Tuesday Price told ABC AM she had not read the whole report, and said Australia’s policies were “adequate” to meet its 2020 Kyoto target. Asked to explain how Australia will reach the 2030 target, Price cited the emissions reduction fund – which only has $250m left of $2.5bn – the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the government’s investment in Snowy 2.0 hydro-electric. Price conceded there had been “a slight increase” in Australia’s emissions but blamed an increase in liquid natural gas production. She dismissed scientists who say Australia will miss its targets as “their opinion” but said she was “very comfortable” with Australia’s trajectory. Price said it would be “irresponsible” to commit to phase out coal by 2050 because clean coal technology could be available by then. At a doorstop on the Gold Coast on Monday, Morrison said the IPCC report “does not provide recommendations to Australia or Australia’s program, this is dealing with the global program”. “Let’s not forget that Australia accounts for just over 1% of global emissions, so there are a lot bigger players than us out there impacting on these arrangements.” Morrison said Australia’s emissions per capita were “at their lowest level in decades” and the government’s focus was “to ensure that electricity prices are lower”. Earlier on Monday Morrison ruled out exiting the Paris climate agreement but vowed not to provide more money to the global climate fund. Advice from the Energy Security Board suggests the dumped national energy guarantee would have reduced household power bills by $150 a year. Labor is yet to decide whether it will persist with the Neg for the electricity sector with an emissions reduction target of 45%, or whether it will take a different policy to the next federal election. On Monday Shorten said the government’s priorities were “all wrong” because “they’re not taking action on renewables”. “What we need to do is move our energy mix to having a greater proportion of renewables. But we are not saying that there won’t be fossil fuel as part of our energy mix going forward.”"
"One great taboo in the climate change debate is how much has improved over the past three decades: in public perception; in transnational consensus and determination; in scientific understanding and discovery. To stress these things seems to ignore the urgency of the situation, minimise the scale of the potential disaster, and let the air out of tyres that really need to be at their most pneumatic.  As climate scientists “politely urge, ‘act now, idiots’”, (as the life-affirming BBC news story has it) the last thing we should do is congratulate ourselves on how far we’ve come. The fact that global warming has gone from something routinely dismissed as the dreamchild of cranks to the animating campaign issue of the age, over roughly the same period as we’ve forgotten all kinds of other basics of progressive politics – how to argue for universal human rights, for example – is at best a diversion, at worst a bromide. Nevertheless, environmentalism, while it distils everything woeful about the human condition – its short-termism, self-interest, the multiple impediments to cooperation and creativity – also contains the seed of transcendent hope. Both in what it has already achieved – the discoveries it has spurred, the alliances it has fostered – and what it can achieve in the future, including, but not limited to, saving the planet. Donald Trump inhabits the White House and Brazil is shortly likely to elect another climate change denier to its highest office. The International Panel on Climate Change on Monday had to make the same dire warnings about a 1.5C warming limit that we’ve been signed up to since the Paris agreement of 2015 – and done nothing to achieve. A decade ago it was routine to take personal responsibility for climate change, foreswearing air travel and conserving water. This seems to have dissipated, replaced by a commitment to transnational action that is often discussed but doesn’t materialise. There are sound reasons to despair, and there may even be a grim comfort in letting the waters close over our heads, at least until those waters become literal. Yet these setbacks are entirely commensurate with what we know of politics: rail against them, sure, but don’t allow them to eclipse the benefits of the radical change the climate demands. In Britain, 27% of all our emissions come from poor housing stock. Were we to undertake a mass programme of housebuilding, creating homes that were carbon-neutral, while retrofitting existing stock, the impact would be immediate and substantial, and would echo into every area of our lives. There is no longer any serious doubt that more homes are needed: you cannot lock a third of a generation out of owning property and expect that situation to sustain itself indefinitely, the young effectively working in bonded servitude to the old. Imagine if we could overhaul this market in a way that met our obligations to the future, as well as making people’s lives more liveable in the present, and energy bills a thing of the past. A programme so bold needs an unarguable political imperative – the last time we imagined such a thing, it was because of the nation’s obligation to its returning war heroes. Climate change presents an even stronger case, and it’s a challenge that history shows us we can meet. To the charge that we could never afford it, the argument that we can’t afford not to is true but insufficient. Capital needs this at least as much as people do: the drive to divest from fossil fuels is based on the real and fast-approaching danger that assets will become worthless as we commit to leaving them in the ground. Investing in social housing would be far more prudent. In the US, meanwhile, they use 18m barrels of oil a day just in their cars, which they could drastically reduce by making cars lighter, electric and, ultimately, solar-powered. There is no shortage of innovation in this field, no lack of ambition. Nobody, post-Tesla, would argue that a petrol-powered car was preferable to an electric one. The challenge now is to bring the cost down. Nowhere are the interests of the environment and the simple aim of improving lives more closely aligned. In Europe and across the world, renewable energy trounces its carbon competitors. The potential here is not just to make whole continents carbon-neutral within our lifetimes, it is also to foster a profound shared purpose across borders, as the sheer surfeit of sun in some countries, and wind in others, urges forth the infrastructure for sharing resources via, for example, a European supergrid. Not since the last century’s fight against fascism has there been a more legitimate and animating case for transnational cooperation. The battle against climate change can do more than render other political divisions trivial: its solutions have long-term ramifications for all the other crises our vexed democracies are throwing up, from the cost-of-living crisis to inequality, from insecurity to conflict. All those ramifications are good: so yes, we should hurry, before it is too late. But more importantly, we should hurry, because what comes next will be better. • Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist"
"The authoritative new report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change sets the world a clear target: we must reduce emissions of greenhouse gases to net zero by the middle of this century to have a reasonable chance of limiting global warming to 1.5C. Every government should read this report and recognise the clear choice we now have. Accelerate the transition to clean and sustainable growth or suffer the mounting damage from sea level rise, floods and droughts that will severely hinder efforts to tackle poverty, raise living standards and improve prosperity. The report, prepared by leading researchers from around the world, warns that the world has already warmed by about 1C since the middle of the 19th century, and could reach 1.5C at the current rate of warming before the middle of this century. Human activities are currently emitting about 42bn tonnes of carbon dioxide every year, and at that rate the carbon budget – allowing us a 50-50 chance of keeping warming to 1.5C – would be exhausted within 20 years. Even 1.5C of warming would have brutal consequences, according to the report. Poor people, in particular, would suffer as the threat of food and water shortages increase in some parts of the world. But the report makes clear that allowing warming to reach 2C would create risks that any reasonable person would regard as deeply dangerous. One of the report’s most stark statements is that “limiting global warming to 1.5C, compared with 2C, could reduce the number of people both exposed to climate-related risks and susceptible to poverty by up to several hundred million by 2050”. However, the report also makes clear that the target of halting global warming at 1.5C could still be technically feasible, particularly if there is a strong and immediate response from governments. The report recognises that the collective pledges by governments that were submitted before the Paris agreement was reached in 2015 are consistent with warming of 3C by the end of the century. By contrast, a path that would prevent a rise of much more than 1.5C would require annual emissions to fall by about 50% between now and 2030, and reach net zero by 2050. We have to achieve these emissions reductions over a period when the world’s economy will experience a radical transformation. Global infrastructure will have more than doubled between 2015 and 2030. The global economy will have doubled within two decades or so if it continues to grow at about 3% each year on average. And the population living in cities, where most emissions occur, will likely double in the next four decades. Hence the next 10 years will be absolutely crucial in determining what kind of world will exist in the decades beyond. If we act decisively, and innovate and invest wisely, we could both avoid the worst impacts of climate change and successfully achieve the sustainable development goals, as the IPCC report emphasises. If we do not, we face a world in which it will become increasingly difficult for us and future generations to thrive. But we will also need greater international cooperation. The IPCC report is clear that we may not be able to limit warming to 1.5C without the need later in the century to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Although we can do this by expanding forests and other vegetation, we must also explore other options, including the development of carbon capture and storage. While many green campaigners are opposed to this technology because they fear it could undermine the pressure on the fossil-fuel industry, we cannot afford to close it off as an option. A collective international effort is needed to speed up research, development and deployment of this area. While it is clear that it is still technically feasible to limit warming to 1.5C, we will not succeed without strong political will and leadership. Governments should recognise both the great peril we face from poor choices or hesitation, and the enormous opportunity on offer from the rapid transition to a clean and sustainable economy. Governments, companies and communities should embrace this transition: it is the growth story of the 21st century. Cities must be planned so that we can live, breathe and move freely in them. And we must reverse the degradation of our land, soils and forests so that they are more productive and absorb more carbon dioxide. All of this is both possible and extremely attractive, as the most recent report from the New Climate Economy, published last month, spells out. We will see in the next two years whether governments have understood the message of this IPCC report as they revise their nationally determined contributions to the Paris agreement. We have in our grasp the opportunity to choose a safer and more prosperous future.

"A Danish-flagged cargo ship has successfully passed through the Russian Arctic, in a trial voyage showing that melting sea ice could potentially open a new trade route from Europe to east Asia. The Venta Maersk made the journey as a one-off trial, said Palle Laursen, the chief technical officer of A.P. Moller-Maersk, the world’s biggest shipping group. The ship, carrying a cargo of frozen fish, arrived in St Petersburg on Friday, after leaving Russia’s Pacific port city of Vladivostok on 22 August. “The trial allowed us to gain exceptional operational experience,” said Laursen, adding the ship had performed well in the unfamiliar environment. The Northern Sea route could be a shorter journey for ships travelling from east Asia to Europe than the Northwest Passage over Canada because it will likely be free of ice sooner due to climate change. Experts say it could reduce the travel distance from east Asia to Europe from the 21,000 kilometres (13,000 miles) it takes to go via the Suez Canal, to 12,800 kilometres (8,000 miles). This would cut transit time by 10 to 15 days. It’s not the first time a cargo vessel has completed the Russian Arctic route, and Maersk underlined that the journey was “to gain operational experience in a new area and to test vessel systems”. “Currently, we do not see the Northern Sea route as a viable commercial alternative to existing east-west routes,” Laursen said. “Today, the passage is only feasible for around three months a year which may change with time. Furthermore, we also must consider that ice-classed vessels are required to make the passage, which means an additional investment.” During the 37-day journey, Maersk was “in close and regular dialogue” with Russian authorities and ice breaker companies as precautionary measures. The company said the vessel which made the trip is among the world’s largest ice-class ships specifically designed to operate in cold waters. "
"The former Liberal party leader John Hewson has all but urged voters in Wentworth to reject the party he once led, telling them to register a protest vote over the government’s failure to tackle climate change. Hewson, who held the blue ribbon Sydney seat between 1987 and 1995, said the byelection was ripe for the taking for a “significant independent”, a likely nod to the candidate considered a chance to claim the seat from the Liberals, Kerryn Phelps.  “This byelection is a unique opportunity to register a protest vote,” he said as he campaigned with Stop Adani activists in Bondi on Saturday. Phelps is hoping to capitalise on the cause of the 20 October byelection – the deposition of Malcolm Turnbull as leader – and Hewson noted to voters on Saturday that the former prime minister had lost his position “fighting for the national electricity guarantee, which is the fourth best solution”. Hewson said the Wentworth electorate, considered progressive on environmental and social issues, wanted “a decisive emissions strategy, they want a transition from coal and fossil fuels to renewables”. Speaking to Guardian Australia on Saturday afternoon, he denied that he was specifically advocating a vote against the Liberals. But he repeatedly emphasised that the seat was “ripe for a protest vote” and also noted that Phelps had taken a “pretty strong position on the environment”. “Whoever wins this byelection is only going to hold the seat for a few months, maybe to May next year, when there would be a general election when people have a chance to vote again,” Hewson said. “So they could register a very strong protest vote in this byelection and then vote according to the responses from the major parties by the time of the next general election.” Asked if a person voting on the environment should not the support the Liberals, Hewson said “that’s probably right”. He also suggested that a Liberal loss might “create a change in [the government’s] thinking” if it was clear environment was the key issue on election day. “I’m not going to run an argument against [Dave] Sharma per se, I think his hands are tied,” Hewson said. “I think he’s a good candidate but I think his hands are tied on climate.” On Thursday, a ReachTel poll conducted for the Clover Moore-backed independent in Wentworth, Licia Heath, suggested the Liberals were at risk of losing the seat, with Sharma ahead 51% to 49% on a two-party-preferred basis. Sharma has said he believes anthropogenic climate change is real and needs addressing. He has previously told Guardian Australia: “There is only one Liberal candidate in the race and that’s me. If people want to see a Liberal government in Canberra, they should vote for me.” He said on Saturday: “If I’m elected on 20 October, I will be a strong voice in government ensuring that we met our international commitments. “Better use of technology can help us to both meet our emissions reduction targets and improve energy affordability and security.” Phelps said she was “delighted” by Hewson’s comments. “People are sick of inaction by governments and the Liberals have been paralysed on this for about a decade or more, and the Labor policy doesn’t go far enough,” she told Guardian Australia. Simon Fosterling, a Stop Adani campaigner and Bondi surf lifesaver, said on Saturday Wentworth voters wanted “an MP who will put the community and the future of our kids before coal companies like Adani”. Previous polling has indicated that climate change policy, housing affordability and education are important issues for Wentworth voters. The ReachTel poll on Thursday put Sharma’s predicted primary vote at 40.6%, a sharp decline from Turnbull’s 62.26% first-preference vote performance in 2016. Labor, which is being represented by Tim Murray, had a first-preference vote of 19.5% – up 2 percentage points on 2016, the poll said."
"Almost all of Britain’s homes and businesses would be powered by wind, solar and nuclear power by 2030, under bold new green energy plans being outlined by Labour. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, will declare on Tuesday that the party is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions to zero by the middle of the century. The UK’s current goal is an 80% cut by 2050. Such a move would put the UK ahead of the EU and signal that it intends to be a strong international climate leader post-Brexit. It would also leapfrog Labour ahead of the Conservatives on climate-change action. The government is shortly expected to instruct its climate advisers to explore what a tougher global-warming goal means for the UK’s domestic carbon targets but has not yet pledged to hit zero emissions. Long-Bailey, who is seen by some as a potential future leader, will also outline a series of new proposals on energy to meet the long-term carbon goal. Experts said they were far more ambitious than the party’s current policy. The plan envisages 85% of electricity coming from renewable and low-carbon sources by 2030, a dramatic increase on the 50% they provide today. That would involve a sevenfold increase in offshore windfarms and a tripling of solar power, enabling nearly 20m homes to be powered by wind and solar. The party would also “remove the barriers” the Conservatives put in place for onshore windfarms. Labour would like to see doubling of onshore windfarms by 2030. Long-Bailey said: “The potential benefits of transitioning to a sustainable economy are enormous and we want to make sure these are shared by everyone … the Tories are not up to the job of dealing with the existential threat posed by climate change.” Beyond electricity, the party is also grappling with how to keep the UK warm without burning fossil fuels. Around 85% of the country uses gas for heating, with most of the rest coming from oil and a tiny proportion from renewable sources such as heat pumps and biomass. Labour is mulling a goal of providing 44% of heat from renewable sources by 2030 and reducing heat demand from buildings by almost a quarter. The party is expected to officially adopt the energy goals later this year. Jim Watson, director of the UK Energy Research Centre, said: “These proposals are envisaging a much more ambitious approach than current policy. With respect to renewable electricity, particularly wind, the ambitions look achievable by 2030.” Industry sources told the Guardian that the proposals for more green electricity were ambitious but could be met provided there was a rethink on onshore windfarms, which are currently ineligible for subsidies. However, Watson said that meeting the targets on low-carbon heat would be more difficult and “a tall order”. Greenpeace said the adoption of a net-zero emissions goal for 2050 was “truly transformative”. Friends of the Earth said the energy proposals could help the UK seize the potential of “huge innovations happening in renewable energy technology.” Labour said it had created a working group with unions to “ensure workers are protected” as the energy industry shifts from fossil-fuel power stations to a renewable future."
"Huge reductions in meat-eating are essential to avoid dangerous climate change, according to the most comprehensive analysis yet of the food system’s impact on the environment. In western countries, beef consumption needs to fall by 90% and be replaced by five times more beans and pulses. The research also finds that enormous changes to farming are needed to avoid destroying the planet’s ability to feed the 10 billion people expected to be on the planet in a few decades. Food production already causes great damage to the environment, via greenhouse gases from livestock, deforestation and water shortages from farming, and vast ocean dead zones from agricultural pollution. But without action, its impact will get far worse as the world population rises by 2.3 billion people by 2050 and global income triples, enabling more people to eat meat-rich western diets. This trajectory would smash critical environmental limits beyond which humanity will struggle to live, the new research indicates. “It is pretty shocking,” said Marco Springmann at the University of Oxford, who led the research team. “We are really risking the sustainability of the whole system. If we are interested in people being able to farm and eat, then we better not do that.” “Feeding a world population of 10 billion is possible, but only if we change the way we eat and the way we produce food,” said Prof Johan Rockström at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, who was part of the research team. “Greening the food sector or eating up our planet: this is what is on the menu today.” The new study follows the publication of a landmark UN report on Monday in which the world’s leading scientists warned there are just a dozen years in which to keep global warming under 1.5C, beyond which even half a degree will significantly worsen the risks of drought, floods and extreme heat. The report said eating less meat and dairy was important but said current trends were in the opposite direction. The new research, published in the journal Nature, is the most thorough to date and combined data from every country to assess the impact of food production on the global environment. It then looked at what could be done to stop the looming food crisis. “There is no magic bullet,” said Springmann. “But dietary and technological change [on farms] are the two essential things, and hopefully they can be complemented by reduction in food loss and waste.” About a third of food produced today never reaches the table. The researchers found a global shift to a “flexitarian” diet was needed to keep climate change even under 2C, let alone 1.5C. This flexitarian diet means the average world citizen needs to eat 75% less beef, 90% less pork and half the number of eggs, while tripling consumption of beans and pulses and quadrupling nuts and seeds. This would halve emissions from livestock and better management of manure would enable further cuts. In rich nations, the dietary changes required are ever more stark. UK and US citizens need to cut beef by 90% and milk by 60% while increasing beans and pulses between four and six times. However, the millions of people in poor nations who are undernourished need to eat a little more meat and dairy. Reducing meat consumption might be achieved by a mix of education, taxes, subsidies for plant-based foods and changes to school and workplace menus, the scientists said. To halt deforestation, water shortages and pollution from overuse of fertiliser, profound changes in farming practices are needed. These include increasing crop yields in poorer nations, more universal water storage and far more careful use of fertilisers. “I was surprised by the fact we need a combination of very ambitious options,” Springmann said. “We really need to push it to the edge of what is possible.” All the diet and farming options are already being implemented in somewhere in the world, said Springmann. In the Netherlands and Israel, fertilisers and water are being better used, while big cuts in meat consumption are being seen among young people in some cities. But a global change is needed, he said: “I think we can do it, but we really need much more proactive governments to provide the right framework. People can make a personal difference by changing their diet, but also by knocking on the doors of their politicians and saying we need better environmental regulations – that is also very important. Do not let politicians off the hook.” Prof Tim Benton at the University of Leeds, who was not part of the research team, said: “Ultimately, we live on a finite planet, with finite resources. It is a fiction to imagine there is a technological solution allowing us to produce as much food as we might ever want, allowing us to overeat and throw food away.” He said the environmental burden of the current food system “undermines the ability of future generations to live on a stable and ecologically rich planet”. Prof Peter Smith at the University of Aberdeen, who was also not part of the research team, said: “We know food choices are very personal, and that behaviour change can be difficult to encourage, but the evidence is now unequivocal – we need to change our diets if we are to have a sustainable future. The fact that it will also make us healthier makes it a no-brainer.”"
"In this warming world, some parts of the planet are warming much faster than others.  The warming is causing large ice bodies to start to melt and move rapidly, in some cases sliding into the ocean.   This movement is the topic of a very new scientific study that was just published in the journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters.  The Arctic is warming much faster than other parts of the planet and the ice there is showing the signs of rapid warming.  This fact has serious consequences. First, melting ice can cause sea levels to rise and inundate coastal areas – it also makes storms like hurricanes and typhoons more destructive.  Melting ice also causes a feedback loop, which can cause more future warming and then more ice loss.  It should be noted that there are different types of ice.  Some ice floats on water and is called sea ice.  When it melts, the ocean water level hardly budges because the ice is already in the sea displacing liquid water.  But, sea ice is really important for this feedback loop I mentioned above.  Other ice is on land and may be a large ice sheet or a smaller glacier.  These ice bodies sit atop the land and “rest” there.  In some cases, they extend out off the land and into the ocean where they partly float on liquid water.  When this land ice melts, the liquid flows into the oceans and can cause significant ocean level rising. So, the importance of ice depends on what type it is, where it is located, and how fast it is melting. And this brings us to the new paper. The researchers looked at a type of high latitude glacier in their study.  These glaciers hold enough water to cause about 1 foot (about a third of a meter) in sea level rise. Typically, they exist in cold and dry areas, where snowfall is limited.   How do glaciers move?  Well really by either sliding over the underlying bedrock or surface that they sit on, or by deforming and stretching under their weight. The colder glaciers tend to move by the deforming and stretching process.  Glaciers that have wetter and more temperate regions involve more sliding.  But regardless of how they move, these glaciers, particularly the glaciers that have both cold and temperate parts, experience surges in their motion.  These surges are short duration times where the glacier moves a lot.  During a surge, ice is redistributed from one part of the glacier to another region.  The authors in this study observed such a glacier surge.  It happened at an outlet glacier that is mainly of the “cold” type in Russia.  At the Vavilov Ice Cap on October Revolution Island, the authors find it “is undergoing extraordinary acceleration and thinning but displays no previous evidence of surging.”  The authors write, the 300-600 meter thick 1820 square kilometer Vavilov Ice Cap is frozen to its bed over the majority of its area, apart from a region along its western margin where basal sliding is potentially important for faster flow.  In 2010 the ice in the region began to accelerate and the next year, crevasses were observed that matched the patterns of ice acceleration. The researchers were able to watch this surge in ice motion in real-time using satellite images. They could track the motion and show the incredible speed of flow.  What caused the rapid motion? This is an important question because if the motion is caused by human warming, we can expect the behavior to be repeated elsewhere as temperatures rise.  Importantly both air and ocean-water temperatures could be a factor.  One potential cause is surface meltwater.  The top of the ice can melt, and liquid water then can flow downwards, into the ice through cracks and holes.  This flowing water can precondition the ice for rapid motion.  This fact may be a contributing cause to the motion.  Basically, the melted water lubricated the ice/ground interface causing more sliding and more friction.  The friction caused some of the bottom ice to melt and released more liquid water, and a cycle had begun. The researchers also took measurements of elevation to better understand areas where ice was becoming thicker or thinner.  In addition, they studied the forces that exist within the ice itself to help elucidate the cause of the increased speed. Obviously, this is an evolving area of study and all of the questions have not yet been answered.  However, I was impressed when I read that even though these types of surges are becoming more common, what the researchers observed in Russia was still unique.  They describe the rate of ice loss at Vavilov as “extreme.” The authors also point out,  It is startling that the Vavilov Ice Cap, until recently, an apparently stable ice cap with an almost entirely frozen bed that is almost entirely above sea level, is able to rapidly discharge such a large proportion of its ice in the ocean over such a short period. So, to answer the question, how fast is it moving?  In 2015, it reached speeds of up to 82 feet in a single day. It currently is sliding 15–35 feet a day. For comparison, that is much faster than the average 2 inches per day we would see with no surge events. The takeaway message is that once we thought these large bodies of ice responded slowly to changing conditions.  But this research shows us differently.  It shows that ice sheet can move quickly and once we pass a threshold, they may be hard to stop.  This finding makes it more crucial for us to slow down global warming before it’s too late."
"London, Jakarta, Shanghai and Houston and other global cities that are already sinking will become increasingly vulnerable to storms and flooding as a result of global warming, campaigners have warned ahead of a landmark new report on climate science. The threat to cities from sea level rises is increasing because city planners are failing to prepare, the charity Christian Aid said in the report. Some big cities are already subsiding – the ground beneath Shanghai, for instance, is being pressed down by the sheer weight of the buildings above – and rising sea levels resulting from global warming will make the effects worse.  The cities named in the report are sinking for a variety of reasons. Jakarta is thought to be subsiding by 25cm a year largely because of groundwater extraction, and Houston is sinking as the oil wells beneath it are depleted. Bangkok’s skyscrapers are weighing it down, while London is slowly sinking for geological reasons: Scotland is slowly rebounding after having been weighed down by glaciers during the last ice age, which is pushing southern England downwards like a see-saw. The warning comes as the world’s leading climate scientists meet this week in South Korea to finalise a comprehensive study setting out whether and how the world can avoid temperature rises of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the body of scientists convened by the UN, has been asked to examine the consequences of such a rise and assess what progress can be made to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The world has already warmed by roughly 1C from pre-industrial levels, and sea levels could rise by 40cm if that increases to 1.5C, previous science from the IPCC has suggested. Sharp brakes on greenhouse gas production are expected to be needed to halt the rise. Under the 2015 Paris agreement on climate change, governments pledged to hold warming to no more than 2C, with an aspiration not to surpass 1.5C, based on previous IPCC advice. The new IPCC report, to be published on Monday, is expected to show that remaining within the 1.5C limit is still possible but only with strong action to reduce carbon in the atmosphere. Christian Aid, one of many organisations publishing studies to coincide with the IPCC’s judgment, looked at the consequences of a 1.5C rise for a selection of eight major cities around the world. The report concludes that poor development choices are exacerbating cities’ vulnerability to weather shocks. Kat Kramer of Christian Aid, who wrote the report, said: “These global metropolises may look strong and stable, but it is a mirage. As sea levels rise, they are increasingly under threat and under water.” Dozens of the world’s biggest cities are built in coastal areas and near major rivers, making them vulnerable not just to sea level rises but also to storm surges, which can send high seas inland and past maritime defences. The UK and the Netherlands experienced such a storm in 1953, when high tides and a storm surge inundated coastal regions. If similar weather were to strike today, the damage could be much greater despite sea defences, because of rising sea levels and the increased severity of storms that is likely to result from climate change."
"The warning signals of climate change that have hit people around the world in the last few months must be heeded by national governments at key meetings later this year, political leaders and policy experts are urging, as the disruption from record-breaking weather continues in many regions. Extreme weather events have struck around the world – from the drought and record temperatures in northern Europe, to forest fires in the US, to heatwaves and drought in China, to an unusually strong monsoon that has devastated large areas of southern India.  As the northern hemisphere summer closes, polar observations have just established that the Arctic sea ice narrowly missed a record low this year. The sea ice extent was tied for the sixth lowest on record with 2008 and 2010. Sea currents and wind conditions can have large effects on sea ice extent from year to year, but the trend is starkly evident. “Put simply, in the last 10 years the Arctic is melting faster than it ever has previously since records began,” said Julienne Stroeve, professor at University College London. “We have lost over half of the summer sea ice coverage since the late 1970’s and it is realistic to expect an ice-free Arctic sea in summer in the next few decades.” Of particular concern is the decline in thick ice which forms over several years. “The older ice has been replaced by more and more first-year ice, which is easier to melt out each summer,” she explained. Not all of the effects of this year’s extraordinary weather, which has also seen the UK’s joint hottest summer on record, can be traced directly to climate change. However, scientists are clear that the background of a warming planet has made extremes of temperature, and accompanying droughts and floods, more likely. This week, scientists are gathering in South Korea to draw together the last five years of advances in climate science to answer key questions for policymakers. The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) celebrates its 30th birthday this year with what is likely to be a landmark report to be released on Monday 8 October. What is expected to emerge will be the strongest warning yet that these unusual occurrences will add up to a pattern that can only be overcome with drastic action. Thousands of the world’s leading climate experts collaborate on the periodic reports, released roughly every half-decade. They have grown clearer over the years in the certainty of their evidence that climate change is occurring as a result of human actions, and firmer in their warnings of the disruptive consequences. This time, the scientists will attempt to answer whether and how the world can meet the “aspiration” set in the Paris agreement of 2015 to hold warming to no more than 1.5C, beyond which many low-lying states and islands are likely to face dangerous sea level rises. When the scientists deliver their verdict, the onus will pass to politicians to translate their advice into concrete action. Already in recent weeks, global initiatives have begun aimed at doing so: the Global Climate Action Summit in San Francisco last month spurred protests, and dozens of local governments and multinational companies to make pledges; the second One Planet Summit saw advances in climate finance; while at the UN General Assembly, secretary general António Guterres urged world leaders to step up, calling climate change “the defining issue of our time”. Evidence showing that tackling climate change can be an economic boost rather than a brake has been growing. The recently published New Climate Economy report says more than 65m new low-carbon jobs could be created in just over a decade, and that 700,000 premature deaths from air pollution could be avoided every year by government action on climate change. A further $2.8tn could be added to government revenues by 2030 by reforming perverse incentives to burn fossil fuels. Nicholas Stern, co-chair of the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate, which produced the study, said: “Current economic models fail to capture both the powerful dynamics and very attractive qualities of new technologies and structures [that reduce carbon]. Thus we know that we are grossly underestimating the benefits of this new growth story. Further, it becomes ever clearer that the risks of the damage from climate change are immense, and tipping points and irreversibilities getting ever closer.” The existence of tipping points – thresholds of temperature beyond which certain natural processes become irreversible, such as the melting of permafrost, which may release the greenhouse gas methane and create runaway warming effects – is a key concern of many climate scientists. The faster emissions rise, the sooner we may unwittingly pass some of these key points. For all these reasons, the IPCC’s special report comes at a crucial point. Scientists and economists have warned that if the world cannot shift course within the next few years, the consequences will be dire, as new infrastructure built now – in energy generation, transport and the built environment – will be made either to low-emissions standards or in the high-emissions habits of the past. As the IPCC’s next comprehensive assessment of climate science will not be available until 2021, this year’s report will be vital in shaping policy. Ted Chaiban, director of programmes at Unicef, urged governments to seize the opportunities for action offered by this year’s series of political meetings offers for action. “Over the past few months, we have seen a stark vision of the world we are creating for future generations,” he said. “As more extreme weather events increase the number of emergencies and humanitarian crises, it is children who will pay the highest price,” he said. “It is vital that governments and the international community take concrete steps. The worst impacts of climate change are not inevitable, but the time for action is now.” After the IPCC publication, the world will face a key test of faith in the 2015 Paris agreement, the only global pact stipulating action on temperature rises. This December in Poland, the UN’s climate change arm will hold a two-week meeting aimed at turning the political resolve reached in Paris three years ago into a set of rules for countries to follow on reducing emissions. The political situation is more fraught than it was in the runup to Paris. The US is pulling out of the landmark climate agreement and is likely to play little part in the talks. Australia’s government is also in turmoil over climate actions. Now the challenger for Brazil’s presidency, Jair Bolsonaro, is threatening to withdraw its participation – a potential blow to the Paris consensus, as Brazil was a linchpin among rapidly developing nations. All eyes will be on China, which has shown remarkable progress on renewable energy and emissions reduction, and India, where climate champions have found common cause with opponents of increasingly damaging air pollution. Patricia Espinsoa, the UN’s top climate official, warned that only “uneven progress” had been made so far on the 300-page rulebook for implementing the Paris targets, leaving the rest of the work for December. While the dangerous weather of the first half of 2018 has raised concerns worldwide that we are seeing climate change in action, many leading experts told the Guardian they were optimistic that political and business leaders this year would help set the world on a different course to avoid the worse predictions of untrammelled warming. Achim Steiner, administrator of the UN Development Programme, said the past few years had seen “extraordinary progress” in areas such as renewable energy and the take-up of low-carbon technology: “This is real, not in the future but happening now. We are showing that we can do this, we can bring down emissions, it doesn’t need to be a disaster.” Adopting low-carbon aims now would set developing countries on a course to a brighter future, added Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, former economic minister of Nigeria and a member of the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate. “Now is the time to do this, before we lock in high-carbon infrastructure,” she said. “Now is the opportunity for real sustainable growth.” Political leaders will find that global investors back them up in opting for low-carbon policies, predicted Frank Rijsberman of the Global Green Growth Institute. “I see this from investors, from businesses,” he said. “They are ready, and they see low-carbon as the future.” Felipe Calderón, former president of Mexico, called on political leaders to take note: “We can turn better [economic] growth and a better climate into reality. It is time we decisively legislate, innovate, govern and invest our way to a fairer, safer, more sustainable world.”"
"No more Paris agreement. No more ministry of environment. A paved highway cutting through the Amazon. Not only that. Indigenous territories opened to mining. Relaxed environmental law enforcement and licensing. International NGOs, such as Greenpeace and WWF, banned from the country. A strong alliance with the beef lobby.  In a nutshell, this is what Jair Bolsonaro, who is sailing towards Brazil’s presidency after taking a near-majority in a first round vote on Sunday, has promised for the environment. Biography Born in Glicério in São Paulo in 1955 to parents of Italian descent, he served in the army from 1971 until 1988, when he was elected as a city councillor in Rio de Janeiro for the Christian Democratic party. In 1990, he became a federal congressman for the same party. He has since been affiliated with a number of political parties. On 22 July, he was officially nominated as the presidential candidate of the Social Liberal party. Policies Bolsonaro espouses populist and nationalist views that often stray into far-right territory.  A vocal opponent of same-sex marriage, abortion, immigration and other progressive causes, he has defended the death penalty and the 1964-85 military dictatorship. On foreign policy, he has said he wants to improve relations with the US. Economically he says he is pro free market and privatisation.  Political style Deliberately provocative and polarising. He has praised Gen Pinochet, expressed support for torturers and called for political opponents to be shot, earning him the label of ""the most misogynistic, hateful elected official in the democratic world”.  In his bid to capitalise on Latin America’s lurch to the right, he paints himself as a tropical Donald Trump: a pro-gun, anti-establishment crusader set on ""draining the swamp"" and cracking down on violent crime. Controversies On top of repeated calls for a return to dictatorship, he has made equally inflammatory attacks on women, black people, gay people, foreigners and indigenous communities. Earlier this year, he was charged by the attorney general with inciting hate speech.  Support and first round victory Bolsonaro has a devout following among some conservative voters, who admire his promises to get tough on rampant violent crime, and won 46% of the vote in the election's first round.  An enthusiast for torture and the 1964-85 military dictatorship, the retired army captain is famous for racist, homophobic, authoritarian and misogynistic rhetoric. But his views on how to manage Earth’s largest tropical rainforest are just as grim and appalling. Bolsonaro has galvanised voters in urban centres who are disillusioned with the political establishment’s corruption scandals and attracted to his “tough-on-crime” positions amid rising criminality rates. He received 46% of the vote on Sunday and now faces a 28 October run off with the Workers Party’s Fernando Haddad, who polled 29%. In the Amazon, illegal loggers, miners, land-grabbers, as well as large land owners have rallied to his banner. Here, they don’t expect Bolsonaro to enforce the law. On the contrary, the hope is that he fulfils his promise to obliterate nearly all environment and pro-indigenous legislation. He won massive support in rural central western states and all but one Amazonian state. In August, Bolsonaro raised eyebrows internationally when he pledged to join Trump’s US and withdraw Brazil from the Paris agreement. That means the country would no longer be committed to curb its emissions from the deforestation of the Amazon, which is here a bigger source of greenhouse gas than the burning of fossil fuels. Bolsonaro accepts the climate is changing dangerously. CHN asked him about this during a press conference in April. He said the solution was in controlling the growth of the world’s human population. “This explosive population growth leads to deforestation,” he said. “Because you will not grow soy on the terrace of your building or raise cattle in the yard. So we have to have a family planning policy. Then you begin to reduce the pressure on those issues that lead, yes, in my opinion, to global warming, which could be the end of the human species.” Yet he praised president Trump’s policy on the Paris deal and implied that it was part of a UN plot to strip Brazil’s sovereignty over the Amazon. “Congratulations to Trump. If it were good for them, [the US] wouldn’t have denounced it,” he said, adding that a concept for a “136m-hectare ecological corridor” that would be “under world’s control, not ours” had “been discussed”. ” I don’t know how deeply,” he added. Brazil’s current environment minister Edson Duarte said: “Instead of spreading the message that he will fight deforestation and organised crime, he says he will attack the ministry of environment, Ibama and ICMBio [Brazil’s federal environment agencies]. It’s the same as saying that he will withdraw the police from the streets.” Speaking to the O Estado de S.Paulo newspaper, Duarte said: “The increase of deforestation will be immediate. I am afraid of a gold rush to see who arrives first. They will know that, if they occupy illegally, the authorities will be complacent and will grant concordance. They will be certain that nobody will bother them.” Bolsonaro’s environment policies are tied to racist attitudes toward minorities and Brazil’s indigenous peoples. In a speech last year, he said: “Minorities have to bend down to the majority … The minorities [should] either adapt or simply vanish.” Expressing a view common to military circles, he has claimed, without evidence, that indigenous land rights are part of a western plot to create separatist Amazonian states supported by the UN. “Sooner or later, we will have dozens of countries inside [Brazil]. We won’t have any interference in these countries, the first world will exploit the Indians, and nothing will be left for us,” he said last year. Bolsonaro has promised to open indigenous lands to mining and other economic activities. About 13% of Brazil’s territory is recognised indigenous lands, most of them in the Amazon. They are a major barrier to protect the forest, only 2% of rainforest deforestation has occurred inside indigenous territory. The law protects indigenous rights. Article 231 of the 1988 Constitution states that indigenous peoples have “original rights over the lands that they have traditionally occupied”, although the land belongs to the state and they have no ownership rights over minerals. But there are concerns about whether Bolsonaro will respect these laws. Several analysts have warned Brazil could slip towards authoritarian rule. These fears have increased in the past weeks. His running mate, general Antônio Mourão, has argued for a new constitution without popular participation and raised the possibility that Bolsonaro could proclaim a self-coup. Both Bolsonaro and Mourão have defended the excesses of Brazil’s military dictatorship, which displaced and killed (intentionally or through diseases) thousands of Indians in the Amazon, amid an effort to build roads and hydroelectric dams in the forest. The armed forces have never recognised any wrongdoing. “If he wins, he will institutionalise genocide,” says Dinamam Tuxá, the national coordinator of Brazil’s Association of Indigenous Peoples, in a phone interview with Climate Home News. “He has already said that the federal government will no longer champion indigenous rights, such as access to the land. We are very scared. I fear for my own life. As a national leader, I am sure I will be punished by the federal government for defending the rights of the indigenous peoples.” During the campaign, Bolsonaro promised he will abolish the ministry of environment and transfer its functions to the ministry of agriculture. The agriculture portfolio will be handed to politicians from the “beef caucus”, a conservative group of lawmakers who control about one third of Congress and have opposed indigenous land demarcations and advocated for the reduction of conservation units, among other measures, to expand the agriculture frontier. Last week, they formally endorsed Bolsonaro. In several speeches, he said he would end the “fine industry” run by Ibama and ICMBio, to control illegal mining, deforestation and logging. On Sunday he used his first post-election statement to vow to neuter Ibama. This is personal for Bolsonaro. In 2012, he was caught fishing illegally inside a federal reserve off the coast of Rio de Janeiro and was issued a $2,700 fine. Since then as a member of Brazil’s chamber of deputies, he has targeted Ibama, going as far as presenting a bill that forbids its agents to carry weapons, even though they operate in some of the most dangerous areas of the country. Ibama will be stripped of its environmental licensing powers, he said during the campaign. These will be redistributed to other official agencies. That means, for instance, that federal agency will no longer be able to contain controversial projects such as the reopening of the disused BR-319, an 890km highway that cuts from one of the most preserved areas of the Amazon, and São Luiz do Tapajós, a giant hydroelectric plant planned to be built in an area inhabited by the Munduruku indigenous group and river dwellers. BR-319, which connects Manaus to Porto Velho, is specially troublesome, as it will allow for secondary roads. According to a study by NGO Idesam, an area as big as Germany and Belgium combined is under its influence and will become more vulnerable to land-grabbers and deforestation. Recent attempts to pave it have been barred by Ibama. “He names Ibama and ICMBio as his number one public enemies and has given several messages that he will reverse environment and social laws,” said André Guimarães, director of the Amazon Environmental Research Institute. “However, one thing is what he says during the electoral campaign. Another thing is what he will be able to do if he takes office.” Guimarães said that recently the beef caucus has tried to relax environmental and slave labour legislation, but failed in most of the attempts due to strong opposition. “He will try and he is obstinate, but it’s up to the civil society to react against it. It will be a scenario with intense and almost permanent disputes,” he said. “We must be indignant.”"
"One thing I’ve learned in more than a decade of political polling is that public consensus is an incredibly rare commodity. We may not have the theatre of US supreme court confrontations to bring these differences to a head outside the election cycle but our adversarial two-party system has the same tendency to hone in on and amplify our disagreements. What seems a logical, self-evident, moral imperative to one person can seem like the embodiment of reckless turpitude to another. Our representative democracy may be the forum where these differences are supposed to be mediated but right now it is managing a divided nation. A few questions in this week’s Essential Report place this proposition in stark relief. Exhibit A: our new prime minister. For every two of us who dismisses Scott Morrison as a shrill huckster, there are three voters who see him as the straight-taking everyman. While the carefully curated images of Morrison fondling coal and fanging it at Bathurst strike may strike some as bumptious, the new leader is finding favour across the spectrum. In contrast to his more understated opponent, Morrison is drawing significant support across the partisan divide for his personal style. Go figure. There is a similar divide when it comes to where we get our news about the world. As the media fragments and people latch on to their own trusted media source, the tendency to exaggerate differences in opinion only increases. The new prime minister is still locked in the untenable position that proved his predecessor’s downfall. Indeed, for every voter who sees the Guardian as a trusted voice, there is another who sees the Australian as a paragon of truth – even a few who trust both outlets. These results are part of a series of questions we put to the public to test the attitudes to the independence of the ABC following the recent boardroom shenanigans that saw the chairman of the board and the managing director both dispatched. While the public debate was dominated by increasingly frenzied claims and counterclaims of political interference, there is no clear consensus on the national broadcaster either. For everyone who sees the ABC as independent and unbiased, there’s nearly as many who reject the proposition and see it as a plaything of some illuminati of the political correct. And so it goes, on issue after issue, Australia cleaves. From protection of religious freedoms to stemming immigration to the use of social media, we are nation of divided opinions. Even when it comes to the emotionally charged issue of detaining woman and children seeking political asylum, we are incapable of consensus. For every voter who sees the ongoing presence of children on Nauru as a national shame, there’s another voter who sits comfortably with the current policy. My point? There are few givens in Australia politics, issues where people naturally reach a consensus and the political class gets a clear read on the public will. Instead we fall into the pattern of polarising our views and dismissing those who disagree with us. But there is once issue where the consensus is stronger, the partisan divide less pronounced, though you would never guess it from the policy failures of the past decade. That issue is climate change. As the IPCC challenges the world to phase out fossil fuels by 2050, Australians have already formed a consensus that action is required. Sadly, we didn’t have a round of questions about climate change in the field this week to coincide with the report but we do know that the long-running response from voters is that (a) climate change is real and caused by human activity and (b) we don’t think the government is doing enough to address it. On nearly every question we ask around climate change and renewables, support for government action sits around two-thirds of all voters. Take this from September, 69% believe it’s important for the government to agree to a policy to reduce climate change, and 74% approve of government incentives for renewables. Despite our mixed views on the prime minister and the veracity of the News Corp empire, and even the morality of locking children indefinitely on Nauru, there is a consensus when it comes to addressing human-induced climate change. The support is deep and broad, across partisan divides, weighted to the young, who have a greater stake in the outcome, but not exclusively their province. The fact that consensus has not led to political action bears testament to the powerful interests who have the most lose from the transition to a renewable energy base. With coal zealots such as Tony Abbott and Craig Kelly blocking anything that smacks of reform, the new prime minister is still locked in the untenable position that proved his predecessor’s downfall. Even as the warnings of climate inaction intensify, the new prime minister is leading a team that cannot even agree among themselves on doing the one thing the Australian public has managed to unite on. It is now up to the opposition to tap this consensus and build a proposition that taking action on climate can unite the nation rather than divide it. • Peter Lewis is the executive director of Essential and a Guardian Australia columnist"

"I was born after 9/11, so extensive airport security has always been a reality for me. So has the fact that life as we know it on this planet is coming to an end because of climate change, and that my generation will inherit a looming apocalyptic-scale disaster. My name is Jamie, I’m 16 years old, I’m going into my junior year of high school, and I, along with 12 other young people, recently sued the state of Washington. Why? Because Governor Jay Inslee and the whole state government is screwing over my generation. Washington state’s elected officials talk about solving the climate crisis, but then turn around and issue permits for fossil fuel plants that poison communities, and destroy the ecosystems, water, air and land that my generation and future generations need to survive. The even crazier part is that they are destroying our life support systems with a fossil fuel energy system that is wholly unnecessary to provide for our basic energy needs. Experts across the planet say that we don’t need to power our planet with dirty life-threatening fuels. Summers in my home city of Seattle didn’t use to be smoggy to the point that they make me and my friends sick. In fact, they didn’t use to be smoggy and smoke-filled at all. But now, when I scroll through my Instagram feed in the summer, instead of seeing pictures of my friends enjoying the sun, I see some of them wearing gas masks above captions saying things like “I can’t find breathable air anywhere.” I also see pictures of what is supposed to be the Seattle skyline, but all you can see is smoke. Smoke from the fires in Canada – worsened by unusually hot and dry summers – have made the air quality on the worst days worse than in Beijing. The winds blow the smoke down over the Pacific north-west, suffocating us. There was a week in August where I didn’t dare to step outside. It was grey 24/7 – not from clouds, but from smoke. If I went outside, it hurt to breathe, the air smelled funny, and I got a headache and sore throat. This is not the way it used to be in my home town. I’m able-bodied, so for my friends with chronic health conditions, it’s even worse. A few had to go to the ER for respiratory emergencies caused by the smoke. My city is suffocating every summer. The whole Pacific north-west can’t breathe. In the US constitution it says that everyone has the rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Washington state law says that I have a “fundamental and inalienable right to a healthful environment”. But how am I supposed to live my life and pursue happiness when I can’t go outside in the summer and am living on a planet where record-breaking storms, epidemic wildfires, and heat waves are displacing, sickening, and killing thousands? That’s why, with the help of the non-profit organization Our Children’s Trust, 12 other youth and I sued the state of Washington for denying young people our constitutional rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness by actively worsening the climate crisis. Last week we got a ruling from the court that was pretty much a complete write-off to my generation and kids everywhere who apparently now have to be “optimistic” and beg our leaders for rights so basic as a livable planet. Rights that previous generations were able to enjoy. The ruling granted the state’s motion to dismiss our case. Instead of supporting young people asking for a livable future, the state fought tooth and nail to shut us down, and the court ruled in favor of silencing the young people’s pleas. What’s even more disappointing is that the judge ignored the fact that the legislature has already stated that the youth have a “fundamental and inalienable” right to a “healthful environment”. Here is what the law says: “The legislature recognizes that each person has a fundamental and inalienable right to a healthful environment and that each person has a responsibility to contribute to the preservation and enhancement of the environment.” This is the only right the legislature has characterized as “fundamental and inalienable”. The judge who ruled on this case did not assume that the scientific facts we put in the complaint were true, which is what he was supposed to do. He instead relied upon his personal opinions and outside sources for the proposition that the youth should be “optimistic” about their futures and hope that the ruling generation will change course. Optimistic. How in the world am I supposed to be optimistic when I am literally being given warnings not to go outside and breathe the air because it is unhealthy? Apparently he neglected to look outside his window to see how wildfire smoke has plagued our city. When youth try to take a stand, our leaders blatantly and explicitly disregard our rights, pat us on the head, and give us the legal equivalent of “you’re cute, don’t worry about a thing little kid, we’re taking care of it.” But the Washington state government isn’t taking care of anything when it comes to climate action. My generation’s right to a healthful environment is not an “aspiration”, as the judge said. My own legislature has already recognized this as a right that must be protected: “The legislature recognizes that each person has a fundamental and inalienable right to a healthful environment and that each person has a responsibility to contribute to the preservation and enhancement of the environment.” This is the only right the legislature has characterized as “fundamental and inalienable”. The constitution requires the judicial branch to serve as a check and balance of executive and legislative actions that are unconstitutional. This principle was used to challenge laws that segregated African American children in public education, laws that prevented same-sex couples from marrying and laws that prevent meaningful suffrage. Youth being harmed by climate change are entitled to the same kind of consideration. We won’t stop fighting until we get the change we need and deserve.

"A court in The Hague has upheld a historic legal order on the Dutch government to accelerate carbon emissions cuts, a day after the world’s climate scientists warned that time was running out to avoid dangerous warming. Appeal court judges ruled that the severity and scope of the climate crisis demanded greenhouse gas reductions of at least 25% by 2020 – measured against 1990 levels – higher than the 17% drop planned by Mark Rutte’s liberal administration.  The ruling – which was greeted with whoops and cheers in the courtroom – will put wind in the sails of a raft of similar cases being planned around the world, from Norway to New Zealand and from the UK to Uganda. Marjan Minnesma, the director of the Urgenda campaign which brought the case, called on political leaders to start fighting climate change rather than court actions. What is it? Climate litigation is a ​new weapon for environmentalists who are turning to the courts in an attempt to hold governments and corporations to account for the environmental damage they cause. Advocates aim to use the law to force stronger government action to cut carbon emissions, and win damages from the companies responsible to cover the costs of dealing with the impacts of warming. Who is involved? There are hundreds of cases in the pipeline around the globe from India to Uganda; Ireland to Norway, where campaigners are seeking to block oil drilling in the Arctic. The UK government is facing its first major brought by 12 citizens through a legal group called Plan B and which already has the support of the government’s former chief scientific adviser, Prof Sir David King. But it is in the US, the world’s most litigious nation, that the greatest number of cases have been brought, with Arnold Schwarzenegger the latest to confirm he was preparing a lawsuit. Could it save the planet? To date victories are rare​, but campaigners say wins are more likely in future, as public opinion – and the attitudes of judges – shift with the times. A flurry of billion-dollar cases against fossil fuel companies brought by New York city and communities in California over the rising seas has already pushed climate litigation into the limelight. But big oil is fighting back hard, with allegations of a politically motivated conspiracy against them.  She said: “The special report of the IPCC emphasises that we need to reduce emissions with much greater urgency. The Dutch government knows that as a low-lying country, we are on the frontline of climate change. Our own government agencies recently concluded that in the worst case scenario sea levels might rise by 2.5 to 3 metres by the end of the century. The court of appeal’s decision puts all governments on notice. They must act now, or they will be held to account.” Jesse Klaver, the leader of the Dutch Greens welcomed the decision as “historic news”. He told the Guardian: “Governments can no longer make promises they don’t fulfil. Countries have an obligation to protect their citizens against climate change. That makes this trial relevant for all other countries.” The Dutch government must now decide whether to appeal to the Netherlands’ supreme court, or explain how it will nearly double the entire amount of greenhouse gas emission cuts it has made since 1990 within one year. One of two newly opened coal plants would have to be shut down to comply with the original court ruling, according to a report by CE Delft in 2016. Government sources did not immediately respond to requests for comment but an appeal is thought likely. However, legal sources cautioned that its success was far from assured, given the conservative nature of two courts in The Hague which had now ruled for the Urgenda campaign, and its 886 citizen co-litigants. State lawyers had argued that the judges were “sidelining democracy” by trying to force a policy change but the court found government proposals “unacceptable” in a stinging and wide-ranging judgement that leaned heavily on the European Convention of Human Rights. “Climate change is a grave danger,” ruled Judge Tan de Sonnaville. “Any postponement of emissions reductions exacerbates the risks of climate change. The Dutch government cannot hide behind other countries’ emissions. It has an independent duty to reduce emissions from its own territory.” Rutte’s administration has pledged to reduce emissions by 49% by 2030, but in nearly three decades, the country has so far only cut its emissions by 13%. Since 2012, that figure has barely changed, despite a court ruling for the 25% cut three years ago. Paul van der Zanden, a spokesman for the Netherlands’ economic affairs and climate ministry said: “A possible appeal by the Dutch government will not interfere with the execution of the the Hague court of appeal’s verdict made today. The Dutch government is fully committed to execute this verdict.” Van der Zanden added that a 25% emissions cut by 2020 was “feasible” and said that the Dutch environmental assessment agency would deliver an update on the outlook for doing so next spring. Dennis van Berkel, the legal counsel for Urgenda, which brought the case, told the Guardian that the ruling “has consequences for all governments. They should look at this closely and realise that they are not acting in the interests of their own people. By delaying [climate] actions and not increasing them to the highest possible level – they are violating the rights of their people.”"

"Limiting global warming to 1.5C rather than 2C would likely be the difference between the survival of some Great Barrier Reef coral and its complete decline, according to the latest United Nations assessment of climate change science. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change special report on the impact of global warming of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, released in South Korea on Monday, found coral reefs were likely to decline between 70% and 90% if the temperature increased to that level. If global warming reaches 2C, more than 99% of coral reefs were projected to decline.  Scientists said it underlined the need for urgent global action to cut greenhouse gas emissions – including a rapid withdrawal of coal-fired electricity, a shift that would have major implications not only for Australia’s power grid, but one of its largest export industries. Professor Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, a coordinating lead author on the report and a coral reefs expert with the University of Queensland, said there was a distinct difference in the amount of coral that would remain under the two warming scenarios. “Going to 2C and above gets to a point where corals can no longer grow back, or you have annual bleaching events. On the other hand, at 1.5C there’s still significant areas which are not heating up or not exposed to the same levels of stress such that they would lose coral, and so we’re fairly confident that we would have parts of those ecosystems remaining,” he said in a briefing to journalists before the report was made public. While the report does not break down the impact of warming by regions, Australian scientists highlighted several areas where there were clear differences between 1.5 and 2C. Others included the relative risk of drought in the south, river flows, the retreat of snow and ice in alpine areas and the scale of disruption in fisheries as marine species moved south to cooler waters. It found it not too late to avoid 1.5C, but time was limited. Global emissions rose 1.6% in 2017 after three years of flatlining. The world is considered on track for between 3 and 4C by 2100. Reaching the goal would likely involve the use of coal for electricity across the globe being cut by between 59% and 78% by 2030 and 73% and 97% by 2050, compared with 2010 levels. Professor Peter Newman, from the Curtin University Sustainability Policy Institute and a lead author of a chapter of the report on the global response to the climate change threat, said he expected coal would rapidly phase out of the Australian power grid but the country was yet to appreciate what was in store for exports. “The kind of exports that we’re having will be phased out. We need to get that in our perceptions of the future – that coal cannot be a major part of our export future. It’s not going to have anything like the ability to compete with solar and wind particularly, and we need to adapt out economy accordingly,” he said. “It is going to happen in India, it’s already happening in China.” The report is likely to increase pressure on the Australian government to explain how it will meet its pledge of a 26-28% cut in national emissions below 2005 levels by 2030. It has been accused of having no policies to meet the target since walking away from a pledge to introduce a policy to cut emissions from the electricity sector. National emissions have risen each year since former prime minister Tony Abbott abolished the carbon price introduced under Julia Gillard. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has said he was focused on reducing power prices, and would not increase Australia’s emissions target. Labor has pledged to make a 45% cut by 2030, in part by boosting the share of renewable energy to 50%. On Sunday, the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, said: “If you don’t care about doing the right thing by the environment, then you actually have no right to be the government of Australia.” The IPCC spent two years on the report following a request by the world’s governments at the 2015 climate conference in Paris, where 195 countries signed up to an historic agreement to keep the global temperature rise this century well below 2C and – following urging by low-lying island nations and vulnerable developing countries - to pursue efforts to limit the increase to 1.5C. Citing more than 6,000 scientific references, the panel found limiting warming to 1.5C would require rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society. It says achieving it would have clear benefits for human health and nature and, compared with 2C, help ensure a more sustainable and equitable society. It is estimated there has already been 1C of warming, overwhelmingly due to human activities that produce greenhouse gases. The world is already seeing and feeling the consequences, including increased extreme weather, rising sea levels and reducing sea ice cover in the Arctic. At the current rate of warming, the world is considered likely to reach 1.5C warming between 2030 and 2052. Professor Mark Howden, a review editor for the report and the director of the Australian National University’s Climate Change Institute, said: “We need new technologies, energy efficiency, clean energy sources, less deforestation, better land management, sustainable agriculture and many other things. The good news is there’s actually movement in the right direction in many of those areas, but we need to do more and faster if we are to keep to 1.5C or even 2C.” Howden said 2C warming would mean significantly increased risk of drought, particularly in Australia’s southern half. Expected reduced rainfall would reduce soil moisture while the higher temperature would increase evaporation, depleting the soil more quickly and more rapidly triggering droughts that would tend to be more intense and last longer. He said river flows in south-east and south-west Australia tended to fall linearly as temperatures increased. Hoegh-Guldberg said corals on the reef faced not only warming waters but ocean acidification, which slowed the pace at which they could form skeletons, affecting the ability to recover from extreme events. There has been a 26% increase in acidity since the pre-industrial period. “It is a really major change in the way ocean systems are working,” he said. “The problem with ocean codification is it takes about 10,000 years to correct in terms of the ocean receiving alkaline material from the continents … so it is here to stay.” Newman gave Australia a varying scorecard in its efforts in responding to the issue compared with other countries. On energy transformation, he said Australia was showing quite rapid progress comparable with the rest of the world due to the disruptive effect of solar and wind energy. On urban systems, there were examples of how to do zero carbon development in place, such as the White Gum Valley in Perth where renewable energy was shared to make housing cheaper, though the approach was yet to be mainstreamed. On the land, there were good signs of reforesting to capture emissions. But on industry and transport, Australia’s performance on emissions was poor. To reach 1.5C, the report found global emissions would need to fall by about 45% below 2010 levels by and be “net zero” by about 2050. Any remaining emissions would need to be balanced by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Going past 1.5C warming – described as “overshooting” – would mean a greater reliance on techniques that remove carbon dioxide from the air. The effectiveness of these techniques is unproven at large scale and may carry significant risks. The IPCC found it meant the decisions made today were critical. "
"There was a barely stifled schadenfreudian glee echoing across the liberal press through this burning hot summer. Environmentalists could scarcely disguise their we-told-you-so smirks as one suffocating heatwave after another rolled over the globe, wildfires savaged landscapes from Siberia to California and broken temperature records kept piling up. But yearning for catastrophe is an ugly desire, and it is exactly the wrong way to think about global warming. Disasters always hit marginalised people first and worst, and as tempting as it might be to hope the calamities of 2018 bring new kinds of change, that desire only betrays how badly environmentalism needs to be overhauled.  It is a historically precarious moment for the environment. We constantly hear dire warnings from some UN body or scientific panel that we have this many years left and these thresholds before we hit the tipping points and the whole world unravels. Despite this piercing urgency, the languages at hand are so consistently inept that it often feels impossible to know what real change might be or how to talk about it. The reflexive condescension of environmentalism that looks down on those working in industry is precisely what we do not need. Working people whose livelihoods and families depend on resource extraction have no time for catastrophism, and defaulting to that desire sets back climate justice movements immeasurably. Ecology has to speak to class directly and confront inequality with believable claims that a different world is possible. Individualising responsibility is one of capitalism’s prime defensive strategies: reducing ecology to just another consumer decision and isolating governments from culpability. Blaming the choices individual people make in the context of limited options and grinding employment pressures is a fool’s errand. We are all implicated in these extractivist ideologies: we’re all burning almost everything we can get our hands on, and we are as bound up with the contradictions as anyone. We do not need another set of climate strategies built on shame and castigation. We need something more fundamental – something beyond exhortations to recycle more – that can open viable routes to real action. We need an approach that matches the scale of the problem.  There are better ways to think about ecology all around us. Indigenous communities, who are disproportionately affected by extractive industries, have the most pragmatic and compelling perspectives. We have to understand that ecological destruction is entangled with land thefts and colonisation. Last month the Trans Mountain pipeline was rejected by Canada’s federal court of appeal due to a failure to meaningfully consult with indigenous people. This was a shockingly positive development, but was matched the same day when Kinder Morgan approved the $4.5bn sale of the entire pipeline extension to the Canadian government. Justin Trudeau’s baffling eagerness to double down on pipeline expansion underlines the poverty of contemporary ecological imagination. Those two decisions reinforce how essential it is to look to indigenous resistances to define our ecological future. A critique of capitalism and consumption is necessary but insufficient when examining the state of the environment. Capitalism has proven spectacularly malleable and agile, and it will exist long after any climate crisis is averted, if the crisis is framed only as one of climate. We must destroy the colonial assumptions that dominate our relationships with land and the natural world. More than ever, we need creative resistance and radically affirmative social visions of the future if we are to take the calamity of global warming seriously. The burning catastrophes of 2018 can and should open up new lines of urgency. But we have to resist the urge to smirk about suffering and refute the smug catastrophism of environmentalists. • Matt Hern and Am Johal are the authors of Global Warming and the Sweetness of Life: a Tar Sands Tale (MIT Press).

"The party at Bait & Tackle didn’t look like a funeral. The bar was packed with people double-fisting drinks and dancing. But every now and then you caught someone go quiet, stare at the ceiling, take a deep breath and sigh, eyes glimmering. “It’s a lot to take in,” said a woman to a friend standing next to her. “Where are you gonna go for happy hour now?” she asked. “I don’t know,” her friend answered. “Nowhere.” A grey-haired man behind the bar gave a bottle of vodka to a customer who knocked back its last dregs. Barry O’Meara was not just the bartender – he also owned the place, which he had opened 14 years ago. But on 27 January 2018, it was coming to an end. O’Meara would close Bait & Tackle for good. Until then, Bait & Tackle had been a neighborhood bar in Red Hook, Brooklyn. O’Meara was shutting it down because the neighborhood was not what it used to be. The people moving to Red Hook – “the new people”, he said – were displacing his customers, who could no longer afford their rent. “And the people moving in don’t frequent establishments like this,” O’Meara said. “So that’s it.” It was not the ending anyone had expected five years earlier. In October of 2012, O’Meara had stood on the street outside Bait & Tackle watching the ocean draw nearer and nearer. Soon water was pouring into the basement of his bar. With its narrow rivers, estuaries and islands, New York City is extremely vulnerable to coastal flooding. Red Hook lies on the city’s floodplain. Flood maps show that Red Hook – a low, flat peninsula, surrounded by water on three sides – wouldn’t stand a chance in the case of a “100-year flood”, a weather event so massive it has a 1% chance of occurring every year. It might not sound like much of a risk, but “1%” is a deceptively small number. As Arctic glaciers melt, and oceans grow warmer and expand, sea levels are rising. Storms that would have been too weak to push the water to shore in the past will become powerful enough to do so. In the near future, what we think of as 100-year floods might be more like 30- or 40-year floods. Soon, it won’t take a heavy storm for Red Hook’s streets to flood. According to scientists’ projections, the city’s piers will vanish under high tide in the 2020s. By 2080, a normal high tide will flood some streets. Part of Van Brunt Street, Red Hook’s main thoroughfare, is expected to flood daily. Hurricane Sandy, in 2012, offered a grim preview of Red Hook’s future. The storm, which devastated areas all over New York and left 43 dead in the city, hit Red Hook particularly hard. As water gushed out of sewers and into streets, parks and basements, residents were forced to remember that Red Hook used to be a tidal marsh and that old, hidden creeks still stream under the asphalt like veins under the city’s skin. After the storm, Red Hook residents who owned their homes believed their property had lost its value overnight. The truth was more surprising. Over the next several years, Red Hook’s home prices soared. It turned out that, storm or no storm, there were people in New York City and beyond who were willing to pay more than $1m for the chance to live on a floodplain. Red Hook’s transformation was tangible. Two blocks of new luxury townhouses rose on King and Sullivan Streets. In 2016, Tesla opened a showroom there. More and more tourists wandered in for new and rebuilt galleries, restaurants and bars. An old factory, right by the water, was turned into million-dollar condos. The Puerto Rican family that owned the Bait & Tackle building sold it to an investment company in 2016, and O’Meara’s rent shot up by 30%. Rising rents pushed more than a dozen of O’Meara’s friends out of the neighborhood and, in many cases, out of the city entirely. Many Red Hook residents saw their neighborhood as the last bastion of real New York: a place where regular people with regular jobs could still afford to live. That “authenticity” was also part of its charm in the eyes of newcomers – but that didn’t reassure people like O’Meara, who felt the bastion was under attack, not only from the rising sea but from newcomers and their middle-class lifestyle too. Five years after the storm, O’Meara said that Sandy was the beginning of the end for the neighborhood. Then he corrected himself: “There’s no such thing as a fucking end. But it was the beginning of something different.” Andrew Amendola is the fourth Amendola to live in the slender, four-story 19th-century building on Van Brunt Street. He is an only child who grew up without a mother but who shared the house with his father, grandmother, great-uncle and two great-aunts. When Amendola was a kid, Bait & Tackle was still a bait and tackle shop. Back then, in the late 1990s, Amendola and his father used to break through a fence, on to the shore that is now home to the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal, and go crabbing. All they needed was a net and the huge blue claws were theirs for the taking. The silhouette of lower Manhattan shone just a mile away but there was nobody else by the water. Amendola was 13 years old when he saw Barry O’Meara for the first time. The teen had sneaked over to his window to smoke a cigarette when he saw a white guy, back then a rare sight on Van Brunt Street, walking by below. He didn’t know the guy, so he shouted: “Go home, yuppie!” O’Meara, a fourth-generation bartender, was hardly a yuppie. He had grown up in a small Irish village where his great-grandfather had a bar. He had served his first drink when he was eight. When he heard Amendola’s shout, he looked up and shouted back: “Andrew? I’m gonna tell your father that you’re smoking.” Immediately, the window slammed shut. One afternoon in November 2017, Amendola was volunteering behind the bar at a VFW veterans’ club across from his home. His girlfriend came in and took a seat. Amendola fixed her a bloody mary, went to the other end of the bar, and made a quick phone call. “What did the guy want?” Amendola’s girlfriend asked. “He wanted to offer $2.8m for the building. I said no, we’re not getting rid of it.” Amendola gets calls from real estate developers and private equity firms on a regular basis. When his great-aunt Sue Amendola died last fall, the calls got even more frequent. “These people are predatory,” Amendola said. He witnessed the same happen after Sandy. After the market took a hit because of the storm, people came to Red Hook looking to buy. But Amendola has no intention of selling the house where he grew up. Neither $2.8m nor the threat of another hurricane are enough to make him abandon a place that holds all his memories. More than money or safety, he values that he can walk down the block and be annoyed that he has to say “hi” at least to three people. “Like, ‘Oh, this fucking guy, I don’t want to see him right now.’ But I actually like not wanting to see them,” he said. At 26, Amendola plans to spend the rest of his life in Red Hook, just like generations of Amendolas before him did. Red Hook’s desirability is rising because, unlike elsewhere in Brooklyn, townhouses are still relatively affordable there. Some gentrifiers come because they want their kids to attend the local private school that opened a year after Sandy. (Next year’s tuition: $30,200.) Others come because Red Hook is different from most other parts of the city. It is quiet, like a seaside village, except you can see the Statue of Liberty. You can see the sky. You can breathe. It’s easy to forget that people didn’t always want to live on the waterfront. In cities, the rivers used to smell. Water meant pollution and waste, and waterfronts were where the cities pushed the working class, the poor, the new immigrants. It is not a coincidence that Fifth Avenue is as far from any river as possible. This started to change in 1972, when Congress passed the Clean Water Act and water quality across the United States started to improve. At the same time, industry was abandoning cities, leaving behind vacant parcels that eventually attracted commercial developers and wealthy new residents. Across the world, urban waterfronts have become the most desirable, expensive locations, even though water is rising. That’s one of the many quirks of Red Hook and places like it. After more than a century of living inland, the rich – suddenly yearning to live by the water – are pushing the poor and middle class out. This migration might save longtime waterfront residents from rising waters, but it doesn’t save them from losing their homes. On the other hand, many of the low-income residents who still live on the shore don’t have any choice but to stay. Much of New York’s public housing is concentrated by the water, in Red Hook, Coney Island, the Lower East Side, the Rockaways. Red Hook has one of the oldest and biggest public housing projects in the country. More than half of Red Hook’s 12,000 residents are tenants of the New York City Housing Authority. Without government investment in flood protection, they are in harm’s way. Coastal megacities from London to Tokyo and Rotterdam to Shanghai have installed seawalls, storm surge barriers, super-levees and dyke-rings to keep the water out of the streets. New York has not. Americans are better at immediate disaster response than planning for the future, experts say. In the future, there could be less and less government support for struggling working people in places like Red Hook. Flood protection, many urban planners predict, may only be available to those who can afford to pay for it themselves. In November 2017, Andrew Amendola was decorating the vacant lot next to his house for Christmas. Mounting a nativity scene was a family tradition. The afternoon sun made the plastic angels shimmer gold, while a gust of wind blew a reindeer over. “Go home, reindeer, you’re drunk,” Amendola said. The lot is home to four cats. After Sandy, he was sure that they had died. But a few days after the storm, they found their way back. Unlike many people, they had evacuated. If you asked real estate developer Chris Ward, he might say that the vacant lot is another parcel of scarce New York land being underutilized. Ward, now a senior vice-president at the global engineering giant Aecom, has a long history of working with New York’s waterfronts. In September 2016, Ward told the Brooklyn Eagle, a local paper, that Red Hook had two options: to become populated with high-rise buildings, co-ops and condos, or to remain the “underutilized low-income, unconnected community it is today”. Aecom had just announced a proposal to radically transform the neighborhood into a hub of gleaming skyscrapers. The plan included a subway line from Manhattan and 45,000 new apartments in high-rises. In his 2018 State of the State address, New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, put “revitalizing” Red Hook on his agenda and called on the Port Authority to consider relocating the operations of Red Hook’s remaining port, the Red Hook Container Terminal, to Sunset Park. He also asked the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) to study options to extend the subway from lower Manhattan to Red Hook, a key component of Aecom’s vision for Red Hook’s reinvention. Robert Pincus, a climate scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, moved to Red Hook after Sandy because his rent in Carroll Gardens, on the other side of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, spiked. In Red Hook, his family could afford to rent a home. He wouldn’t buy property in Red Hook: he’s too aware of the climate risks. But he understands why Aecom and other developers have their eyes on the neighborhood. “There are billions of dollars to be made,” Pincus said. “The developers make them in 30 or 40 years, and only then the land will flood.” Chris Ward disagrees with this view. He sees new development as a way to build and finance flood protection in waterfront cities across the globe. “Most cities are taking the approach that with thoughtful architectural design and engineering we can ameliorate the risk at at an acceptable level,” he told the Guardian. Aecom is not the only company going after the neighborhood. According to the New York Times, Related Companies, a major real estate developer, is also circulating a draft plan on Red Hook’s revitalization. The plan is titled “New York’s Next Big Thing”. On his final night at his bar, Barry O’Meara got to the bar’s tiny stage for his final speech. He had to wait a little for the crowd to quiet down and listen. “We have made friends for life and we have made enemies for life,” O’Meara said into a microphone, with his usual flair for drama. A slideshow of pictures ran on a screen behind him. In one photo, a sign outside Bait & Tackle said “FREE HURRICANE ADVICE”. In Sandy’s aftermath, Bait & Tackle became one of the central neighborhood hubs where people went for help and company. In the years since Sandy, residents of Red Hook and New Yorkers in general have been asking themselves: what is the right thing to do after such a disaster? How do you make plans when you know that it might happen again, but you don’t know if it’s going to be next month, next year, or in three decades? It seems like the rational thing to do would be to leave the waterfront and find a new home – somewhere on higher ground, somewhere safe. But that’s not how people choose a place to live. There are other, more immediately compelling factors to consider. What can you afford? Where feels like home? Where are your friends and family, your favorite bar, your kid’s school? Knowing your neighbors or having a perfect view of the Statue of Liberty can outweigh a far-off-seeming flood risk. It’s not easy to leave a place you love – even if the place, by virtue of its geography, promises to one day kill you. In Bait & Tackle, O’Meara’s speech was almost over. People raised their voices. First, one at a time: “We love you, Barry!” And then all together: “Barry! Barry! Barry!” O’Meara told them to shut up. “I’m not sad,” he said, interrupting the chant. “This room has been too great and too beautiful with happiness and laughter and joy to be sad. I’ve been fucking privileged. Let’s continue the night. I love you all. Thank you.” After the speech, the DJ put on David Bowie’s Let’s Dance. Amendola stood next to the bar wearing a T-shirt bearing the words he once shouted to O’Meara: “Go home, yuppie!” Now, he wiped away tears."
"Australia is in a position to replace thermal coal exports with the export of renewable energy technologies if the parliament can settle an energy policy and end a decade of policy chaos, the Labor frontbencher Pat Conroy says. The shadow assistant minister for climate change and energy will use an appearance at a renewable energy conference on Thursday to argue that Australia can remain an energy export “superpower” during the transition to low-emissions energy – “it just won’t be fossilised carbon, instead it will be wind and solar power”.  Conroy says in his speech that thermal coal exports will “decline significantly over the next few decades” but Australia will continue to export metallurgical coal, “which makes up 65% of our coal exports by value, for a long time to come, as there is no other way of manufacturing steel at an industrial scale”. He says that, with the right policy settings, Australia can replace thermal coal exports with renewable energy exports, and also develop the hydrogen economy. Some critics of renewables – such as the former prime minister Tony Abbott – contend that a high take-up of low-emissions technology will lead to the de-industrialisation of Australia. But Conroy argues the reverse is true. “The shift to renewables also offers Australia the opportunity to revitalise the manufacturing sector. “As the world decarbonises its electricity supply, the nations that can transform into manufacturing powerhouses are those with the cheapest energy, which will be the nations with the best renewable energy resources.” He says the opportunity is twofold. Australia has the highest average solar radiation per square metre of any continent in the world, plus abundant wind and wave resources, generating power that can be firmed by gas peaking plants, pumped hydro and batteries. Conroy says Australia is also well positioned to “be the capital of mining and processing of key inputs for the renewables revolution”. “We are the second-largest producer of rare earths, we supply 41% of the world’s lithium and we have 12.4% of global copper reserves. These are all crucial materials for clean energy and battery manufacture.” Conroy will restate Labor’s commitment to create renewable energy zones if it wins the next federal election. He says the zones will be central to developing new industries such as hydrogen, direct electricity export and new energy intensive manufacturing facilities. He says boosting the domestic renewables industry will have flow-on benefits for traditional industry, with metallurgical coal required to manufacture wind turbines. “In a similar vein, if we source local steel for the wind farms that will be built to meet Labor’s 50% renewable energy commitment, this would need 423,000 tonnes of Australian steel. This is around 10% of Australia’s annual steel production.” He says producing a coherent development plan for Australia’s renewables industry “is not some hippy nirvana” but a transition already underway in other countries. Conroy says the US remains a case in point, despite Donald Trump pulling out of the Paris agreement and winding back some of the environmental regulations of the Obama era. He says there are close to 3.4m clean energy jobs in the US, 200,000 jobs in the United Kingdom and 350,000 in Germany. The speech is critical of the Turnbull and Morrison governments for floating and rejecting a series of energy policy options during this term in government, and Conroy notes that industry and the general public “are crying out for a vision for our energy sector”. The new energy minister, Angus Taylor, was invited to address Thursday’s renewables conference but declined. Labor is yet to determine its final position on the future of national energy guarantee – the policy developed by the Coalition to promote reliability and emissions reduction in the electricity sector – before being dumped by the new Morrison cabinet. But while the opposition’s position is not yet final, the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, has sent a number of public signals over the past month that the ALP is likely to keep the Neg mechanism with a higher target for emissions reduction. A number of industry stakeholders are lobbying the ALP to keep the Neg. Last month, Shorten told the ABC “we think that there’s something that we can work with there” and “we are prepared to use that as part of our framework going forward”."
"The UN’s environment chief, under fire over huge travel expenses and rule-breaking, has been forced leave the UN general assembly in New York early and return to his Nairobi headquarters to deal with the growing crisis. The problems for Erik Solheim, Norwegian head of the UN Environment Programme (Unep), include the Netherlands becoming the latest nation to withhold millions of dollars in funding until the issues are resolved.  The Guardian can also reveal that Solheim has now recused himself from professional dealings with his wife and a Norwegian company that employed her shortly after it signed a deal with Unep in April. Pressure is growing on Solheim after he was sharply criticised by a draft internal UN audit over his $488,513 globe-trotting travels that called them “contrary to the ethos of carbon emission reduction”. The audit also said he had “no regard for abiding by the set regulations and rules” and that he claimed unjustified expenses. The UN staff union in Nairobi, where Unep is headquartered, called some of the draft audit’s findings “mind-blowing”. Solheim said he had already paid back money for instances of oversight and that he had made changes where other rules had been broken. Solheim wrote to all 125 national ambassadors on the committee that oversees Unep’s work on Tuesday to tell them he was cutting short his New York trip and putting in place measures to increase the accountability of managers and their travel. “We will address issues of trust between management, our staff, member states and/or partners,” he said in a letter seen by the Guardian. Unep is governed by the UN environment assembly, the world’s highest-level decision-making body on the environment. Its president, Siim Kiisler, Estonia’s environment minister, told the Guardian the next steps to be taken would be decided when the internal audit was completed. “I need to ensure that member states have full trust that their resources are used for the benefit of the environment,” Kiisler said. “I will read the official report carefully, talk to Mr Solheim and after that form a standpoint.” He said Solheim’s travels had played an important role in making Unep visible, but added: “It certainly has too look and feel right as well, and of course, follow the rules of the system.” On Wednesday, a spokesman for the Dutch government told the Guardian: “A planned payment of €8m will be held until Unep provides more clarity, and until it is clear that Unep is taking this matter seriously.” The job taken by Solheim’s wife, Gry Ulverud, is with the Norwegian company X Four-10/REV Ocean, which aims to build the world’s biggest research ship as well as a “World Ocean Headquarter” near Oslo. On 4 May, the company announced a memorandum of understanding with Unep, although Unep did not issue a press release. On 1 June, Ulverud posted on her Facebook page: “Started New Job at at X Four-10/REV – Manager for Strategy and Partnership”. The page has now been removed. “In relation to any notion of nepotism, I wish to clarify that my spouse was recruited to REV Ocean through an open, transparent and competitive process,” said Solheim. He said her recruitment was based on 25 years of professional experience “with the Norwegian Refugee Council, as a diplomat, as deputy representative to Unesco from 2014-2016 and over 10 years with the Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research.” Solheim said he wrote to the UN Ethics Office for advice on the matter of his wife’s appointment on 9 July and again on 11 September, when he told it REV Ocean was giving Unep funding over four years. Solheim said he received the advice on 14 September and wrote to the UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, to recuse himself on 19 September, the same day the Guardian first contacted him on the matter. Solheim said he and Ulverud would have no “direct bilateral interaction” when acting in their official capacities. He said all matters relating to REV Ocean would now be dealt with by the Unep deputy executive director. The Guardian has also seen emails relating to an initial refusal to allow Ulverud to attend a Unep meeting on marine plastic litter in May, just before she started at REV Ocean. One senior manager advises Ulverud to ask an official for “assistance”. That official then asks colleagues: “Can we think of a creative way to have Gry join the meeting next week?” Ulverud was subsequently invited. “The available records do not indicate that Ms Ulverud used any influence to obtain access to the meeting other than being an employee of a private sector entity in partnership with Unep,” said Solheim. Her contract started just after the meeting took place, but a Unep spokesman said: “Her employer requested her to do a number of things before assuming her new functions, including attending the meeting in Nairobi.” The Guardian can be contacted securely here or by email at damian.carrington@theguardian.com"
"A Minnesota judge abruptly dismissed charges against three climate change activists during their trial on Tuesday, saying prosecutors had failed to prove that the protesters’ attempt to shut down two Enbridge Energy oil pipelines caused any damage. The Clearwater county district judge Robert Tiffany threw the case out after prosecutors rested their case and before the protesters could use their defense: that the threat of climate change from using crude oil drilled from Canadian tar sands was so imminent that the activists’ actions were not only morally right, but necessary.  The attorneys had long fought to use a “necessity defense” during the trial of the three Seattle-area residents, two of whom admitted turning the emergency shut-off valves on the northwest Minnesota pipelines in 2016 as part of a coordinated action in four states. Such a defense has been used by other activists protesting against pipelines. Their attorney, Lauren Regan, acknowledged outside the courthouse in Bagley that she and her clients were surprised that the judge had granted their motion to dismiss the case. The three defendants faced felony charges involving criminal damage to critical public service facilities. They could have faced up to a year in jail, according to prosecutors. “I’m very relieved the state of Minnesota acknowledged that we did no damage and intended to do no damage,” the defendant, Emily Johnston, said. “I also admit that I am disappointed that we did not get to put on the trial that we hoped for.” The Clearwater county attorney, Alan Rogalla, declined to comment afterward. Climate change activists have increasingly turned to direct actions against oil and gas pipelines, with mixed legal success . Valve-turner cases in other states resulted in convictions that are under appeal. A Massachusetts judge in March cleared 13 gas pipeline protesters who used a necessity defense. While the cases generally have not set binding legal precedents, activists are hoping they help legitimize direct action as a tactic against climate change. In the Minnesota case, Johnston and Annette Klapstein readily acknowledged turning the emergency shut-off valves on two Enbridge Energy pipelines on 11 October 2016, near Leonard, about 210 miles north-west of Minneapolis. A third defendant, Ben Joldersma, called in a warning to Enbridge. Charges were earlier dropped against a fourth defendant. They did it as part of a coordinated action by Climate Direct Action activists to shut down five Canadian tar sands crude pipelines in Minnesota, North Dakota, Montana and Washington state. A total of 11 activists were charged in the four states. The Calgary, Alberta-based Enbridge temporarily shut down the two pipelines as a precaution before any damage occurred. The company issued a statement Tuesday saying the protest was “reckless and dangerous”. “The individuals involved in these activities claimed to be protecting the environment, but they did the opposite and put the environment and the safety of people at risk – including themselves, first responders and neighboring communities and landowners,” the company said. The defendants insisted there was never any danger. “We did everything in our power to make sure this was a safe action, and we did this to protect our children and all of your children from the devastating effects of climate change,” Klaptstein said at the activists’ news conference afterward. The valve turners had hoped to put climate change itself on trial by presenting expert witnesses who would have backed up their claims that climate change was making natural disasters worse, and that the threat of climate change from Canadian tar sands crude – which generates more climate-damaging carbon dioxide than other forms of oil – was so imminent that they had no legal alternatives. But they never got the chance."
"Greece and Turkey were struck by an unusual storm called Zorba last week. This was a tropical-like cyclone, or TLC, also known by the portmanteau term “Medicane”, a combination of Mediterranean and hurricane. Such storms generally occur only once or twice a year, as they require very specific conditions to form, including a mass of cold air and atmospheric instability. Medicanes are circular storms, like hurricanes or typhoons, and have a similar structure with a clear eye at their centre. However, to be classed as a hurricane, a storm must form over the Atlantic and have a sustained windspeed of more than 74mph. Medicanes are smaller and less powerful. Zorba’s wind speed of 56mph would make it more equivalent to a miniature tropical storm than a hurricane. Generally speaking, hurricanes travel from east to west whereas Medicanes go from west to east. Zorba formed over Tunisia where it caused flash floods, killing at least five people, before moving on to Greece. A 2013 study suggested that climate change will lead to fewer Medicanes in future, because the conditions for forming them will be less common. However, the same study also predicted that there would be more severe storms in the region generally, resulting in greater overall damage."
"Several years ago, I wrote about the five stages of climate denial: In 2013 @dana1981 wrote about the 5 stages of #climatechange denial.Stage 1: Deny the Problem ExistsStage 2: Deny We're the CauseStage 3: Deny It's a ProblemStage 4: Deny We can Solve ItStage 5: It's too LateLook where the Trump Administration is.https://t.co/FRQGZ8gQ4r To date, the Trump administration has pinballed between Stages 1, 2, and 3, calling climate change a Chinese hoax, disputing the degree of human causation (100% since 1950), and claiming it’s not a threat.  But the purpose of climate science denial is to obstruct climate policies, and science denial doesn’t hold up in court.  Unlike in the political realm, judicial decisions are generally based on evidence.   The Trump administration wants to roll back the Obama administration’s increased vehicle fuel efficiency standards.  But under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), “if a proposed major federal action is determined to significantly affect the quality of the human environment,” the agency has to publish an environmental impact statement (EIS). And so, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) was required to publish an EIS detailing how the proposed fuel efficiency rollbacks would impact the environment, including via climate change.  Here, the Trump administration shifted to Stage 4 and 5 climate denial. In modeling the proposal’s climate impact, the NHTSA assumed we will follow a scenario in which Earth’s average surface temperatures will warm 3.5°C (6.3°F) by 2100.  That’s surprisingly realistic – it’s a scenario in which countries follow through with their current climate policies but don’t enact any more stringent ones in the future.  The problem is that the NHTSA assessment then concluded the fuel efficiency rollbacks aren’t important because they won’t have a significant impact on those hotter global temperatures: The impacts of the Proposed Action [freezing fuel efficiency standards] and alternatives on global mean surface temperature, precipitation, sea level, and ocean pH would be extremely small in relation to global emissions trajectories. This is because of the global and multi-sectoral nature of climate change. These effects would be small, would occur on a global scale, and would not disproportionately affect the United States. This is true.  The Trump administration proposal decreases vehicle fuel efficiency requirements in the United States for the years 2020–2025.  Of course it won’t have a big global impact relative to all greenhouse gas emissions from two centuries of burning fossil fuels.  The report continues: The emissions reductions necessary to keep global emissions within this carbon budget could not be achieved solely with drastic reductions in emissions from the U.S. passenger car and light truck vehicle fleet but would also require drastic reductions in all U.S. sectors and from the rest of the developed and developing world.  We could make this argument about literally any and every individual climate policy.  Just like a single step won’t move a person safely out of the path of an oncoming truck, no single climate policy will significantly change global temperatures eight decades from now.  It will take a myriad of climate policies passed by countries all around the world.  That’s precisely why virtually every country signed the Paris climate agreement.  The report’s maddening illogic doesn’t stop there: In addition, achieving GHG reductions from the passenger car and light truck vehicle fleet to the same degree that emissions reductions will be needed globally to avoid using all of the carbon budget would require substantial increases in technology innovation and adoption compared to today’s levels and would require the economy and the vehicle fleet to substantially move away from the use of fossil fuels, which is not currently technologically feasible or economically practicable. This isn’t entirely true – electric vehicles are becoming increasingly affordable and economically competitive with gasoline-powered cars.  But more importantly, rolling back fuel efficiency standards will only slow the transition away from fossil fuels.  Requiring higher fuel efficiency in fleets forces automakers to accelerate the research, development, and deployment of zero carbon vehicles.  It’s ludicrous to argue that because the transition isn’t yet feasible we should roll back a policy meant to make it more feasible. The tragedy of the commons is a situation in which individual actors using a shared-resource system act in their own seeming self-interest and deplete the resource as a result.  For example, consider a small fishery with a dozen fisherman each catching as many fish as he can.  Soon the resource becomes overfished and every fisherman suffers the consequences.  Only if they all agree to limit their catches to sustainable levels can the fishery remain a long-term stable resource for all of the fishermen. We’re in the same situation with climate change.  Every country can act in its own short-term self-interest and continue burning lots of seemingly cheap fossil fuels; the long-term result in that scenario would be a catastrophic destabilization of the global climate on which we all rely.  Or every country can agree to take steps like increasing vehicle fuel efficiency standards that cumulatively will slow global warming and avoid the worst climate change impacts. Of course, being a short-sighted nationalist, Donald Trump is the only world leader to reject the Paris climate agreement.  His administration is similarly making short-sighted arguments that coincidentally serve the best interests of the fossil fuel industry, while in this case producing the equivalent carbon emissions of adding 9 million more cars on the road. At least the Trump administration doesn’t deny basic climate science in this report, but worse yet, they’ve taken the nihilistic viewpoint that we’re screwed and nothing we do matters. Like the other stages, this is simply another form of climate denial meant to protect fossil fuel industry profits at everyone else’s peril."
"When Justin Trudeau swept into power in 2015, he pledged to make fighting climate change a top priority for his government. Three years later, Canada’s prime minister is on the defensive, scrambling to both revive his party’s unravelling climate strategy as a growing number of provinces refuse to participate in national carbon tax – and to temper frustrations over his government’s continued investment in the fossil fuel industry.  “From the beginning, [the government] decided they were going to try to thread the needle on the need for climate policy and fossil fuel resource development. They even made the two interdependent,” said Matthew Hoffman, a political science professor at Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs. But on the surface, the strategy appears to be quickly falling apart. Trudeau’s political foes have already seized on the carbon tax in anticipation of the upcoming federal election – still a full year away – but the prime minister has shown no signs of backing down. “Pollution should not be free anywhere across this country,” he said last week.  The political infighting comes as the UN’s intergovernmental panel on climate change warned that drastic changes are needed to offset the impacts of global climate change. As part of a strategy to reduce Canada’s emissions, provinces are required to introduce a tax of at least $20 per tonne on emissions from January 2019, with increments of $10 each year until 2022. In provinces which fail to produce an adequate carbon pricing plan, the federal government would implement its own tax, or “backstop”. Last week, Manitoba became the fifth province to publicly opt out of carbon pricing, arguing that its own plans to combat climate change were sufficient. Saskatchewan, which still relies heavily on coal for its power, has called the carbon tax a “ransom note”. In Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, the rightwing premier, Doug Ford, has vowed to rally opposition to the measure, which he described as “the worst tax ever”. Alberta, home to the country’s oil sands, announced it would leave the plan after the federal government failed to push through construction of the Trans Mountain expansion pipeline – a project Alberta argued was critical to its economy. “Until the federal government gets its act together, Alberta is pulling out of the federal climate plan,” said Premier Rachel Notley in August. “And let’s be clear, without Alberta, that plan isn’t worth the paper it’s written on.” Only two provinces, British Columbia and Quebec, have signalled a willingness to remain in some form of carbon pricing agreement. When the original agreement was laid out, many of the provinces had Liberal politicians in power. Now, a conservative wave across the country has changed the party in power – and the political calculus. “This is a political move by the provinces. It’s conservatives wanting to give the Liberals a black eye,” said Nelson Wiseman, a professor of Canadian studies at the University of Toronto. “If you ask people, ‘Should the government do something about climate change?’ they’ll say yes. If you ask them, ‘Are you prepared to pay higher taxes?’ they’ll say no.” The recent stumbles, however, could end up being a benefit for Trudeau, argued Mark Cameron, director Clean Prosperity, an environmental thinktank. “If anything, this may end up making the carbon price backstop more effective,” he said. “Instead of one or two provinces that are going to be falling under it, there will be four or five. You’ll be getting a more coherent national carbon pricing system.” Carbon taxes are supposed to be revenue neutral, meaning any increase a person pays are offset elsewhere. With its own carbon tax, the federal government could circumvent antagonistic provincial governments and deliver cheques – as high as $600 per year– to individual households. “The [upcoming federal] election is going to be in October,” said Wiseman. “Imagine, in July, people start getting cheques in the mail!” Experts agree that any plan to fight the tax is probably a losing battle: courts have repeatedly affirmed the right of the government to impose a tax on provinces. “Whether that court victory leads to political victory is another question altogether, said Hoffman. “[Trudeau’s] got to build popular support for this.” As he grapples with carbon pricing, Trudeau is also engaged in a delicate task of placating his environmental supporters over frustrations that oil development is detrimental to emissions reductions. Construction on the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, which the government purchased from Texas-based Kinder Morgan, was halted over the summer by a federal court order, largely the result of inadequate consultations with indigenous communities. The government remains committed to pushing the pipeline through – and recently hired a retired supreme court justice to buttress its consultations with First Nations. “The idea that the environment and the economy are not opposing goals, is a great framing,” said Hoffman. “But it’s tough to do when you’re framing the economy not as a transformed economy in a low-carbon world, but as further exploitation of fossil fuel resources.”"
"New energy efficient eco-designs for 15 products including fridges, TVs and dishwashers have been delayed, EU diplomats say, even though experts consider them “crucial” to meeting Europe’s Paris climate pledge. The delays are also expected to mean consumers will miss out on lower energy bills. The design revamps would have saved 62m tonnes of CO2 emissions – as much as Sweden’s annual primary energy consumption – but now look set to be dealt with by the next commission, in which far right parties may be more influential.  Only five energy labelling measures are on track to be approved by a 2 November deadline and at least half of the design overhauls are unlikely to be approved before the European parliament goes into recess in March. “The measures are delayed and we are worried,” one EU diplomat told the Guardian, “We know that some of the products won’t make it but we really hope that we will have nine or 10 of them.” Any hold-ups would impact on EU climate pledges, the official said, adding that a worst case scenario in which all 15 eco-designs were sent back to the drawing board “would not be acceptable” to his government. This would involve a costly bureaucratic double take, with recalculations and technical specifications needed from EU officials, consultants and research centres after 2019. Chloé Fayole, a senior programme manager at the European Environmental Citizens Organisation for Standards (Ecos) said a two-year postponement in adopting the latest package would cost consumers and business €46bn (£41bn) in increased energy bills. Eco-design and energy labelling improvements made up a quarter of the EU’s carbon dioxide emissions cuts in the years to 2020 – and one half of its energy savings. The new measures were expected to save about 5% of Europe’s annual electricity consumption by 2030, and introduce innovative requirements for recycling and repairability. But the EU has been spooked by the past success of UK tabloid campaigns against eco-design proposals, burying planned revamps of hairdryers and hot drinks vending machines in 2016. Officials declined to be quoted on the latest delay, citing a clampdown on whistleblowers under the Juncker commission, but EU sources told the Guardian that the office of Martin Selmayr, the commission secretary general, was responsible for it. Selmayr denied responsibility in comments emailed to the Guardian. He said: “All decisions are on the way, as scheduled by the responsible commission services in the commission’s Decide system and as validated by the first vice-president and the president’s cabinet.” Selmayr’s boss, Jean-Claude Juncker, promised to be “big on the big things and small on the small things” when he was appointed in 2014. Proposals to scrap or review eco-design and energy labelling laws followed soon after, and a bid to improve energy-guzzling toasters went up in flames during the Brexit referendum. Fayole said: “It’s extremely disappointing to see high-level EU officials sabotage Europe’s plans for climate action and waste reduction. Taken behind closed doors, this decision will result in huge losses for consumers and the environment. This is surely not the right strategy ahead of the European elections.” Other products at risk from the delay include washing machines, industrial fans, electric motors, power transformers and welding equipment."
"Climate change is fueling heatwaves, hurricanes and floods, gradually making certain places in the US challenging, if not outright miserable, to live in. Scientists, and some members of the public, are starting to question where in the US will remain comfortable to call home.  The answer, broadly speaking, is north and maybe west. Florida has seen a population boom in recent decades but the southern portion of the state is on course to be submerged by rising seas. The Gulf coast will get supercharged hurricanes, while the south-west and south-east US will be baked by increasingly hostile heat. “Areas towards the north and away from the ocean and that central corridor where you get tornadoes probably look best,” said Vivek Shandas, an expert on climate change’s impact on cities at Portland State University. Shandas recommends looking to live in a “band roughly above the 42nd parallel” – a line of latitude that divides New York and Pennsylvania and forms the southern borders of Oregon and Idaho. Places close to a reliable source of water without being flood-prone as the seas rise are attractive, such as areas near the Great Lakes and the Pacific north-west. “Seattle doesn’t break 90F that often so it’ll be nothing like Phoenix in terms of tolerability of heat,” said Shandas. “Places like Portland, Oregon, and Boise, Idaho, will be relatively safeguarded, apart from a bit of wildfire smoke.” There will be bastions elsewhere. “Cincinnati, for example, is surprisingly good,” said Shandas. “It’s close to the Great Lakes, away from hurricanes, away from the eastern seaboard. It will get more heatwaves, but then again we all will.” Much of the east coast will look dicey if the seas rise at such a pace that they’ll be 6ft higher by the end of the century, but plenty will rest on local decisions made to shield residents from flooding. New York City, for example, is flanked by rising water and is already stiflingly hot in summer, but a multibillion-dollar strategy to build flood defenses and buy out vulnerable areas should help stave off the worst impacts. Climate resiliency is a growing focus for many towns and cities that fret about expensive clean-up costs from disasters, shading people from the heat or dealing with an eroding tax base should residents decide to uproot and head somewhere safer. The scope of these climate considerations is vast, touching on everything from transport links to the availability of flood insurance. Jesse Keenan, a climate adaptation expert at Harvard University, said that he likes Buffalo, New York, and Duluth, Minnesota, as climate refuges as they tick many of the appropriate boxes. “Their sources of energy production are stable, they have cooler climates and they have access to plenty of fresh water,” Keenan said. “They also have less vulnerability to forest fires, as compared to somewhere like the Pacific north-west. They also have a legacy of excess infrastructural capacity that allows them to diversify their economy in the future. Land prices are cheap and they have a relatively well-educated and skilled labor force.” These safe havens are more of a fantasy wishlist for many moderate-to low-income people as property and rental values rise in desirable areas. Others won’t want to leave more vulnerable parts of the US due to more umbilical links, to family and jobs and a sense of home. “As we saw after Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Maria, communities that are able to move can do so, especially if family and friends do the same,” said Shandas. “Those with less resources are left behind.”"
"America’s national parks have warmed twice as fast as the US average and could see some of the worst effects of climate change, according to a new study. Most of Joshua Tree national park could become uninhabitable for its eponymous trees, glaciers will continue to melt away at Glacier national park, and many other of America’s most treasured beauty spots could be rendered virtually unrecognizable by climate change, Patrick Gonzalez, the lead author of the study, writes in the journal Environmental Research Letters.  Even the tiniest of creatures are at risk in the worst-case predictions: the American pika, a small alpine mammal, may no longer be able to survive on park land. “We are preserving the most remarkable ecosystems, and they happen to be in extreme environments,” said Gonzalez, a climate scientist at the University of California, Berkeley. Gonzalez is also the principal climate change scientist for the US National Park Service but conducted and spoke about the research in his university capacity. The study finds that temperatures in national parks could go up 3 to 9C by 2100, under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s worst-case scenario, which shows what could happen without policies to decrease greenhouse gas pollution. With lower emissions, temperatures could still increase more than 2C (3.6F) for 58% of park land, compared to 22% of the US as a whole, according to the study. They are particularly vulnerable because most US park land is in areas that are heating up quicker: in the mountains, the Arctic and the dry south-west. Alaska parks would see the most extreme heat increases, and the US Virgin Islands parks face 28% less rainfall by the end of the century. In Glacier Bay national park, the Muir Glacier melted 640 meters between 1948 and 2000. In Yellowstone national park, trees are dying because bark beetles are thriving in warmer winters. Yellowstone will also become far more vulnerable to wildfires. The area burned could be up to three to 10 times higher by 2100. Joshua Tree national park in California could lose up to 90% of the habitat suitable for its namesake trees. Gonzalez explained that parks at a higher elevation have a thinner atmosphere that warms faster. Higher temperatures are also melting snow cover and making the ground darker so that it absorbs more heat. Parks in California and the south-west US have seen both high temperatures and record-low rainfall, he said. The research is the first comprehensive look at climate change impacts on national parks, Gonzalez said. He said he has been using the climate impacts research to develop plans for parks to adapt and reduce the greenhouse gas pollution they contribute. The Trump administration has rescinded government efforts to slow climate change. The interior department, where the National Park Service is housed, nixed a policy that would have urged management decisions based on science, including climate change research. Park officials in New England scrubbed references to climate change and flooding risks in a report this summer, according to Reveal. The National Park Service did not immediately respond to a request to comment on the study or climate change policies for parks. Jonathan Jarvis, the National Park Service director under Barack Obama who now works at UC Berkeley, said he relied on climate change projections to decide where to relocate and bolster structures in the Everglades national park in Florida, an area that has been hit by hurricanes and faces sea-level rise. Jarvis said he worries that under Trump parks won’t be able to plan long-term for climate change. “The park service manages these assets, these places, for the benefit of the American people, and they should be based on the best available sound science in the long-term public interest, not for some short-term political agenda,” Jarvis said."
"The house on Weber Hill Road is almost a year gone, but it still haunts Emilie Hayes. Thirteen years ago, when she and her husband Steve bought the Missouri property in a foreclosure sale, Hayes vaguely knew that it was in a 100-year floodplain. But the purchase put her children in public schools ranked among the top in the state, and the Meramec river was a whole two miles away. A trickle of a creek that cut behind the house was too small to merit a name. In Sunset Hills, flooding seemed a distant, rare hazard.  Over nearly a decade, the risk revealed itself to be greater than Hayes had known. By 2008, that backyard tributary had roared often enough that the family stacked sandbags permanently next to the beige bungalow to deflect the floodway. Then, on New Year’s Eve in 2015, a storm called Goliath helped  raise the Meramec to a record historic crest of 44ft. Hayes heard a boom as water crashed through their doorway. Muddy water swallowed their basement. It covered the doorframe where she had marked the growth of four children in pencil. “We would never live there if we could do it again,” Hayes, 45, says. No laws require Missouri property owners to warn potential buyers about past flooding – even though the National Flood Insurance Program has paid out more than $813m in damage claims in the state, on 33 federal disasters over 40 years. City ordinance prohibited the Hayes family from modifying their land with berms or levees, and the government refused to buy them out. Last year, after another record flood, the city of Sunset Hills ordered the house demolished. Hayes refuses to sell her piece of the floodplain to a private buyer. “We don’t want somebody to build a house there and have this happen again,” she says. “It wouldn’t be right.” Every US state has seen high water in the last five years; flooding is the largest and most frequent disaster in the country. But in 21 states, homeowners are guaranteed little information about flood risk, according to an analysis by the Natural Resources Defense Council and Columbia University’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law. “You can get a file on yourself from the FBI,” saysNatural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) attorney Joel Scata. “Why can’t you get the file on your property?” When it comes to a property owner’s risk from disasters like flood or fire, “there’s a moral responsibility to ensure that anything that is knowable is known,” says Roy Wright, president of the Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety and the former head of the National Flood Insurance Program. Still, no one place, public or private, holds all that information, even as losses from natural disasters have risen over the last 40 years. In the Carolinas, where Hurricane Florence recently dumped nearly 3ft of rain, both states require only that sellers tell buyers of their “actual knowledge” of flood hazards. South Carolina property owners must disclose whether they have flood insurance at the time of sale. In North Carolina, even where past federal aid requires flood insurance, buyers aren’t guaranteed to find out about a property’s risk. If you were supposed to have flood insurance but didn’t, says Scata, “your chances of getting federal aid are pretty slim”. Many homes in both states outside the federally designated 100-year floodplain are still drying out; for them, disclosure requirements and their consequences are murky at best. Notification efforts for property owners vulnerable to disaster remain uneven across the US, with wide gaps. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says 2017 saw a record $300bn in disaster loss, much of it from fires. Wildfire risk is growing, in the western US in particular, both because of climate change and because local development codes are stuffing new homes into the seam between urban and wildland areas. Since 1990, the size of such areas has swollen by a third. No federal systems alert potential property owners where wildfire may strike next, though some states, including California and Colorado, have mapped regional hazards. Retired lawyer John MacKay, 64, says he didn’t dwell on risk when he moved to Nederland, a foothill community west of Boulder. “It’s the natural beauty, that’s why we moved here,” he says. “I’ll go to a hospice if I want to be absolutely safe.” Two years ago, he and his wife sold up in Florida. With a buddy, MacKay readied his new house in Colorado, getting it painted and moving in clothes, papers and other possessions. A month later, as he watched from afar in Tampa, the Cold Springs fire destroyed eight homes, including his. “It was devastating,” he says. “We were crying for a month. I didn’t come back out right away, because what the hell are you going to do?” MacKay’s first Colorado home was a painful education about the hazards of the backcountry, but he calls it a near miss. When he later bought a second, he was more conscious of its vulnerabilities. Where fire risk is high, as in Boulder county, local efforts have cropped up to reduce it. A voluntary mitigation program called Wildfire Partners advised MacKay to clear wood mulch away from the sides of his house, and to remove notoriously flammable juniper trees. “I’m very fire conscious now, as you can imagine,” MacKay says with a laugh. “I was a dumbass, no question about it. But it all worked out, and we’re happier than ever.” Market forces offer homeowners like MacKay a glimpse of risk. Housing prices are a weak signal for disasters; despite the fires in Santa Rosa, California, for example, the median home price there has continued to climb. But the cost of insurance does tell property owners about fire and flood, if imperfectly. “The price tag is a cue,” says Amy Bach, executive director of advocacy group United Policyholders. Bach says insurers have more experience adjusting to coastal risk and hurricanes. For homeowners risking wildfire damage, Bach argues the industry is “still adjusting”. (In California, those adjustments have set off complaints about spiking rates and losses in coverage.) Last year’s disasters reopened questions about local notice requirements. In Houston, some people lived inside a “flood pool”, an area used for emergency inundation, but beyond the boundaries of the floodplain itself. They now argue that the government should have told them about the risk. In August, California’s governor, Jerry Brown, signed a bill requiring insurers to give homeowners a replacement cost estimate for loss in case of disaster. But informing property owners about disaster risk isn’t the same thing as reducing the risk itself, says Max Moritz, a UC cooperative extension fire scientist at the University of California, Santa Barbara. “Even perfect information isn’t the whole solution. There’s got to be some policies in place to help us where we’re not always going to make the right decision.” Floodplain experts, consumer groups and environmentalists have pushed for a federal-level disclosure notice, under which a property’s flood history would be made public, but such federal disclosure mandates are extremely rare. Only lead paint disclosures are required by federal law at every property sale. Legislation incorporating disclosure principles in the event of flood has passed the House of Representatives, but remains stalled in the Senate. Nevertheless, a federal notice requirement for flood risk may sound like the right thing to weary homeowners; 81% of voters polled by the Pew Foundation last year supported one. Even though such a disclosure rule might harm him, 77-year-old Nate Timm supports the idea too. Late last month, his house in Mazomanie, Wisconsin, flooded badly. At least 12 homes in his village have been condemned. “It just is traumatic,” he says. Timm bought his land 47 years ago, without ever seeing a flood map; over time, he became a leader in minimizing his village’s risk of rising waters. After the town flooded three times in 10 years, Mazomanie cleaned out the floodplain, taking out truckloads of trees and debris year after year, mostly with volunteers. Timm credits that mitigation effort with saving his village from the worst flood risk for 17 years. But he says all that work was no match for climate change, which he blames for 15 inches of rain falling in 24 hours in August. “I’ve never seen anything like it,” Timm says. Timm didn’t need insurance when he got a mortgage; now that it’s paid off, a policy is too expensive. With hindsight, he says he might have planned better. “Considering the impact of climate change, maybe I would have built higher. Maybe I would not have built in that spot.” Warning prospective buyers about past flooding would make sales more fair and regional planning more effective, he insists. “How can you be smart if the information is hidden?” he asks. But if a federal notice rule took effect, Timm suspects that would sap the value of properties like his, paid off decades ago. For older people like him, retired, middle class, a piece of land is a nest egg, security for retirement. He worries disclosure would trap them in vulnerable properties. “If you knew that a place is in the floodplain – OK, you wouldn’t buy that place,” Timm says. “That’s fine for somebody who is coming in for the first time.” This flood has dimmed the future at the property where he spent the last half-century. Timm says he’s thinking of giving up and moving upstate, closer to family. After taking care of his village, Mazomanie, and himself, all these years, Timm feels that, when it comes to the risk of climate change, he’s on his own."

"Brutal heatwaves and forest fires, species extinction and biodiversity loss, melting ice caps and rising sea levels. Every week it seems new and terrible environmental records are being set. Staving off the worst impacts of this reality is one of the defining challenges of our time. I have committed the last 15 years of my life to addressing this as part of the environmental movement. From policy meetings in 10 Downing Street and direct action, to closing coal-fired power stations, I have tried to drive change through any and all means.  I also have a great love for traditionalmusic and perform as one half of a folk duo with Sid Goldsmith. Until recently, my professional and musical life were unrelated. But a few years ago, Sid and I were performing at a folk festival. The gig came after a busy week working on a major announcement that put an end date on coal-fired power in the UK; a development that would cut 20% of the UK’s carbon emissions. And yet we were singing traditional songs about past wars, lost loves and everyday life for people living in the England of old. Sid – who had worked in organic horticulture and struggled against a farming system heavily weighted towards large-scale interests – and I suddenly had a sense that our music was not direct enough in tackling these important issues. We started to wonder whether folk musicians could – and should – do more to reflect on the modern world and the political developments that define our generation’s lives. The environmental movement needed a stronger cultural voice and songs that were rallying cries to help the cause. Folk music can be a powerful political tool. Folk singers have played a critical role in many social and political movements – from Dick Gaughan in the miners’ strike to James Connolly’s fight for Irish independence, or Pete Seeger’s contributions to the civil rights movement in the US. Folksongs have galvanised activists and helped spread a message of hope: we shall overcome. There is something unique about the form of a folksong that lends itself to stirring resistance and hope. Perhaps it is its participatory nature. Many of the classic political folksongs, such as If I Had a Hammer, are inspired by a tradition of work songs that are designed to be sung together and passed down the generations. And the sharing of songs can help unify people around a joint purpose. As James Connolly wrote in 1907: “Until a movement is marked by the joyous, defiant, singing of revolutionary songs, it lacks one of the most distinctive marks of a popular revolutionary movement, it is the dogma of a few, and not the faith of the multitude.” So why doesn’t folk play a larger part in environmentalism? There is wonderful and powerful music already out there; Karine Polwart and Nancy Kerr are among the artists writing environmental material. And there’s a fascinating new project, Songhive, that highlights the plight of Britain’s native bees. But much more can be done to poetically explore the environmental challenges we face as a species, the politics that underpin the damage we are doing and how as humans we are responding. Sid and I address these issues in our music. Our version of John Conolly’s 2004 song The Last Ploughshare speaks of the damage we are doing to the natural world. Our interpretation of Harvest Gypsies, a Boo Hewerdine song, is about the migration of agricultural workers across depression-era America as they escaped the dust bowls caused by damaging farming practices. These practices are still in use and the parallels between those American workers and the future movement of people across the globe as our climate changes are striking. We draw out these parallels and engage in a discussion with the audience about what we can do to address the problem. Our merchandise table often serves as more of a stage for debating soil erosion than for selling CDs! Sometimes we are less direct. Our song The Tide explores how the great tide of people that washes in and out of London each day is a far more significant rhythm for many of us than the tidal rhythms of the River Thames, which would have dominated Londoners’ lives in the past. This disconnection from the natural world partly explains the damage we are doing; why would we protect something that we are so distanced from? Many of the folk clubs of the 1960s and 70s were political spaces where radical ideas could be discussed. It must have felt to people then that they were part of something bigger than folk music and that they were engaging with the political struggles of the time. But many of those clubs are now gone. We need new spaces in which we can experience environmental art, discuss politics, collaborate across disciplines and – most importantly – spread hope that progress is possible if we come together. A performance from last year sticks in my mind. We were at Fire in the Mountain, a beautiful festival held in West Wales. It was a period of bruising political upheaval. People in the UK were reeling from the Brexit debate, a divisive general election campaign and the election of Donald Trump. It felt that night as if our music enabled a collective processing of what was happening in the world, and, crucially, offered hope that better times will come. As we left the stage, the audience continued our final, hopeful chorus from the song Keep your Hand on the Plough. It struck Sid and I that the simple act of bringing people together is a solution to the problems we sing of. A shared sense of purpose and agency can be uniquely stirred by music, and we as musicians must do all we can to create that. The power of folk music lies not just in its ability to document social change but also to effect it. So this is a call to arms for artists, and particularly folk musicians, to engage with environmental issues and for the environmental movement to seek out and support artists who are attempting to help the cause. •Jimmy & Sid tour the UK until 21 December. Their album Many a Thousand is out now. "
"Scott Morrison has resisted conservatives’ calls to withdraw Australia from the Paris climate agreement but ruled out providing more money to the global climate fund. The prime minister made the comments on 2GB Radio on Monday, before the release of a Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, which is expected to call for a phaseout of coal power generation to help limit temperature rises to 1.5C.  Morrison repeated his claim that Australia would meet its Paris emissions reduction target “in a canter”, despite environment department figures showing emissions increased 1.3% in the year to March 2018, suggesting Australia is likely to miss the target. Advice from the Energy Security Board has said that a business as usual scenario will mean the electricity sector will “fall short of the emissions reduction target of 26% below 2005 levels” by 2030. Asked if Australia would be held to the target to reduce emissions by 26% to 28% from 2005 levels, Morrison said: “No, we won’t … we’re not held to any of them at all. Nor are we bound to go and tip money into that big climate fund. We’re not going to do that either. I’m not going to spend money on global climate conferences and all that nonsense.” Australia has contributed $200m to the Green Climate Fund from 2015 to 2018, but the Coalition has come under pressure from One Nation to rule out making further contributions. The fund’s purpose is to help developing countries respond to climate change. Last week the One Nation leader, Pauline Hanson, wrote to Morrison complaining that Australians were not aware when the government signed up to the Paris agreement that it would “lead to organisations like the global climate fund acting like standover men, knocking at our door, telling us to pay up, or else”. Morrison said when Australia signed an agreement “it means something”, and noted it was not the previous Labor government but rather “our government” that had signed the Paris agreement, a reference to the Coalition government of Tony Abbott. “This is an enormously important issue to partners in the Pacific who are strategic partners. So my question is: what is to be gained by ripping it up? “I don’t think there’s much to be gained from ripping it up – it’s not going to affect electricity prices, [the energy minister] Angus Taylor already told you that.” Morrison noted the IPCC report “said a year ago the policies were fine”. In August Malcolm Turnbull dumped the emissions reduction component of the Coalition government’s national energy guarantee, but was removed as Liberal leader regardless. On taking office as prime minister, Morrison declared the national energy guarantee “dead”, leaving Australia without a mechanism to reach its Paris target. On Monday Taylor told Sky News that Australia will meet its Paris commitments, claiming it is “well on target” to achieve a 26% reduction in the electricity sector. Asked how Australia would achieve a 26% reduction overall – including other sectors like transport and agriculture – Taylor did not cite a single policy, instead pointing five times to Australia’s “track record” in meeting Kyoto phase one and two targets. Australia’s emissions have been rising since the repeal of the carbon tax in 2014 and the Coalition will not renew the renewable energy target in 2020. Asked if Australia could phase out coal power by 2050, Taylor said the key “is not to focus on an industry it’s to focus on the outcome”. He said Australia produces only 1% of global emissions so “the critical thing” is for developing countries such as China and India to reduce emissions over time. Earlier, Morrison told 2GB the Paris target of 26% emissions reduction was “not going to touch electricity prices” and “not going to touch one job”. Asked about the prospect of overturning Australia’s ban on nuclear energy, Morrison replied: “If I thought that this was going to have a big impact on Australia’s electricity prices I will do what is necessary to bring electricity prices down. “I don’t have any issues about any of these [sort of things] … The issues there are the same issues everywhere – that the investment doesn’t stack up.” Morrison praised the Hodgman government in Tasmania for the “battery of Australia” project to double pumped hydro capacity."

"Abandoning the UK’s ambitions for a number of new nuclear power stations would cause carbon emissions to spike and push up energy costs, according to lobbyists led by a former Conservative MP. The New Nuclear Watch Institute warned against what it called the “folly of technological tribalism” of pursuing a future powered by renewables and gas-fired power stations, rather than any new nuclear plants. Excluding nuclear would cause the UK to emit millions of extra tonnes of carbon dioxide and put the country’s carbon targets out of reach, the group concluded in a report due to be published on Thursday. Tim Yeo, the institute’s chairman, said: “Abandoning nuclear power leads unavoidably to a very big increase in carbon emissions, which will prevent Britain from meeting its legally-binding climate change commitments. It also raises the cost of electricity.” The claims will be seen as a direct riposte to recent suggestions from the government’s infrastructure advisers, who urged ministers to cool their ambitions for as many as six new nuclear projects and prioritise renewables instead. The National Infrastructure Commission suggested the UK back only one more nuclear plant after the two reactors being built at Hinkley Point in Somerset. However, the New Nuclear Watch Institute, which is supported by nuclear industry firms including the South Korean company eyeing a nuclear project in Cumbria, said “technological zealots” were trying to restrict the range of options for cleaning up electricity generation. The group compared a worst-case scenario – where old nuclear plants are rapidly phased out, Hinkley Point C is cancelled, no nuclear plants are built and offshore windfarms and gas plants fill the gap – with one where nuclear plants account for nearly half of electricity generation by 2030. The “no nuclear” world would lead to the cost of managing the UK’s energy system being 15% higher and result in an extra 35m tonnes of CO2, around a tenth of today’s annual emissions. However, the comparison is based on an extreme scenario – few expect Hinkley Point C will be axed, given the billions EDF Energy has already poured into it. The government has repeatedly made clear it is committed to new nuclear plants but has been grappling with how to help the financing of their huge upfront costs."
"On 10 April 2018, the United Nations general assembly adopted a resolution that paved the way for negotiations on a global pact for the environment. This international treaty would combine the guiding legal principles for environmental action into one single and far-reaching text. In 2015, the adoption of the sustainable development goals and the Paris climate agreement represented major progress. However, environmental damage persists and is more serious than ever before. The years 2017 and 2018 have seen record-breaking temperatures. Biodiversity continues to decline at a rapid pace. With the global pact for the environment, the international community would be equipped for the first time with a treaty of a general nature that covers all environmental areas. It would be the cornerstone of international environmental law, therefore overseeing the different existing sectoral agreements (climate, biodiversity, waste, pollution, etc), filling the gaps and facilitating their implementation. The treaty would gather principles found in key national and international texts, giving them legal value. Each state legislator would find references to the adoption of more robust environmental laws. The supreme courts would draw from it as a common source of inspiration to build the foundations for global environmental law. Citizens and NGOs would see their environmental rights strengthened while businesses would benefit from the harmonisation of the rules of the game. While we celebrate the 70-year anniversary of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the moment has come for a new chapter in the history of international law. We are calling for the adoption of a third pact, enshrining a new generation of fundamental commitments: the rights and duties of states, public and private entities, and individuals relating to environmental protection.

"The first commercial flight to use jet fuel partly made from recycled industrial waste has landed at Gatwick. The Virgin Atlantic plane, travelling from Orlando to London, was powered by a new blend of normal jet fuel and ethanol produced from waste gases, which the airline says could significantly lower aviation’s carbon footprint. The flight’s fuel blend was 5% recycled, but the sustainable element could eventually form up to 50%. It was produced in the US by LanzaTech, which claims it could eventually supply about 20% of the aviation industry’s fuel, and cut greenhouse gas emissions by 65% compared with conventional petroleum. Virgin is bidding for government support to have plants built in the UK that could fuel all its operations. Welcoming the Boeing 747 on arrival was Sir Richard Branson, the airline’s founder, who said the flight was a huge step forward in making the fuel a mainstream reality. “Working with LanzaTech will enable us to greatly reduce our carbon emissions and, at the same time, help support UK industry,” he said. “This fuel takes waste, carbon-rich gases from industrial factories and gives them a second life so that new fossil fuels don’t have to be taken out of the ground.” Virgin called on ministers to provide financial backing for LanzaTech to open three UK plants by 2025, potentially producing up to 125m gallons of the jet fuel blend a year. The LanzaTech chief executive, Jennifer Holmgren, said: “We have shown that recycling waste carbon emissions into jet fuel is not impossible, that waste carbon needs to be thought [of] as an opportunity not a liability, that carbon can be reused over and over again.” However, other similar schemes have failed to come to fruition. Willie Walsh, the chief executive of the British Airways owner, IAG, bitterly criticised a lack of government support for a proposed east London GreenSky factory, which it said could fuel all BA flights from London City airport after 2014, but was never built and abandoned in 2016. The Department for Transport has since committed some funds towards a new project from the biofuels company Velocys, backed by BA and Shell, which could turn household waste, including nappies, into jet fuel. The aviation minister, Liz Sugg, said: “We are committed to cutting carbon emissions and promoting new environmentally-friendly fuels, especially for aeroplanes, which will rely on traditional fuels for years to come.” The UK’s binding climate change targets only require the aviation industry to stay within 2005 levels of CO2 emissions by 2050 – although rapid growth in the number of flights is predicted. Most progress in managing aviation emissions to date has been through more efficient planes – Virgin reported a 24% reduction in its overall CO2 emissions from 2007 t0 2017, with aircraft such as 787s starting to replace old 747s. But the widespread use of more sustainable fuels, allied with carbon-offsetting schemes, will also be required."
"Three years after world leaders signed the Paris climate agreement, we’re about to better understand what that deal means for how we live our lives. On Monday, a major report from the UN’s climate science panel will set out what it will take to limit global warming to 1.5C, the key Paris target. There are reasons to think the world is, finally, getting to grips with climate change. Carbon emissions are still rising but more slowly than before, and in many countries they’re falling. The UK has slashed its emissions to 19th-century levels, and we’re not alone – plenty of other countries, including the US, are making progress as well. Crucially, that’s happened without many people noticing, suggesting the world might be able to deal with the problem without having to persuade the public to change their polluting lifestyles. Studies confirm what we might guess: people lose motivation when they think others aren’t pulling their weight But this is wishful thinking. The UK’s recent emissions cuts have mostly come from shutting coal power stations, which had few friends, and there aren’t many left to close. And that only happened after years of campaigning, but it was still much easier than what is to come. Cutting emissions further to stop dangerous warming will depend on people changing how they live: flying less and eating less meat and dairy, for example. There’s no way this can be done as quietly as what’s been achieved so far. Persuading people to cut down on things they enjoy for the sake of the climate might seem impossible. In most European countries, about three-quarters of the public say they’re worried about climate change, yet less than a third would accept higher taxes on fossil fuels to cut emissions. But this climate apathy can be overcome if it’s tackled in the right way. The first step is to understand the psychology behind apathy. Climate change is exactly the kind of threat our minds aren’t equipped to worry about. It seems distant, happening mostly in the future and to other people. The widespread tendency to think “I’ll be OK”, known as optimism bias, makes it easier for people to assume such distant problems won’t affect them. Partisanship is a problem, too. Arguments about climate change are often polarised between left and right, and the public widely see it as a left issue. This is a problem because people are more likely to believe what they hear from those they identify with, and to reject what they hear from others. If they usually hear about climate change from leftwing people, the majority will tend to think it’s not for them. The distance between emissions and their effects also makes it harder to feel guilty or outraged about them. It’s easy enough to be angry when a crime has an identifiable victim, and to feel ashamed when we are at fault. But climate change is double-blind: everyone’s emissions go into the same atmosphere and no one knows in advance who exactly will suffer. Burning fossil fuels isn’t a victimless crime, but it’s not instinctively obvious who the culprits and the victims are. And there are more psychological barriers. Cutting emissions requires people to trust authorities to be competent, honest and fair – a tall order at a time when only a third of people say they trust government. Those authorities have to persuade the public to change how they live. But most people don’t like change, favour the status quo and are averse to losing what they have. This is compounded by the fear that others might be freeloading on our efforts. Studies confirm what we might guess: people lose motivation when they think others aren’t pulling their weight – it’s known as the sucker effect. Yet, daunting though these barriers are, they can be beaten with political leadership and honesty. To start with, the international community has to admit its plans aren’t enough. Commitments to cut emissions, such as the Paris Agreement and the UK’s Climate Change Act, give the impression the problem is under control. It isn’t. The UK is set to miss its targets from the mid-2020s, while global plans are so weak they would, even if achieved, leave us on course for dangerous warming. In a year in which extreme weather has battered every part of the planet, it shouldn’t be hard to demolish the belief that climate change is someone else’s problem. Those in the centre and right of politics who want serious action to be taken should be more prominent in the debate. You don’t have to agree with a Conservative about how to cut emissions to see that the issue looks more pressing when it can’t be dismissed as the special interest of one political faction. But everything rests on showing that the process is fair. When Donald Trump announced the US would pull out of the Paris agreement, he said it was because the deal was unfair, not because climate change itself was a hoax. Success depends not only on showing he was wrong about how the effort is shared between countries, but also on showing the effort is being shared fairly at home. Governments must be smarter than just taxing pollution – they will fail if most people have to change what they eat and where they go on holiday, while the rich can buy their way out of any sacrifices – and they have to be transparent about how they are sharing the burden fairly. It won’t be all burden, though. Cutting emissions could bring benefits including clean air, new forests and well-insulated homes. Research suggests these can be the most persuasive arguments for climate action. The BBC TV programme Blue Planet II transformed how we think about the impact consuming plastic has on the planet. Since its broadcast last year, we have had a tougher plastic bag tax, a ban on microbeads, calls for a latte levy on disposable cups, and supermarkets racing to scrap plastic packaging. This happened because it made us face up to the way our lives contradict our values. The show first made us fall in love with the oceans, before confronting us with what we’re doing to them: albatrosses, turtles and whales choking on the rubbish we – each of us, personally – throw away. But Blue Planet II didn’t produce a similar outcry about climate change. That may not seem a problem so long as there are emissions cuts that don’t rely on people in vast numbers changing how they live. But as the world faces up to what it will take to limit warming to 1.5C, it’s clear this road is running out. There’s no way to stop dangerous warming that doesn’t involve the public. • Leo Barasi is the author of The Climate Majority: Apathy and Action in an Age of Nationalism, published by New Internationalist"
"Political leaders have been urged to act on the landmark special report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which has warned that strong efforts would be required to prevent disastrous consequences from dangerous levels of climate change. Christiana Figueres, the former UN climate chief who led the historic Paris agreement of 2015, said: “There is nothing opaque about this new data. The illustrations of mounting impacts, the fast-approaching and irreversible tipping points are visceral versions of a future that no policy-maker could wish to usher in or be responsible for.” A key finding of the new IPCC report is the dramatic difference that restricting warming to 1.5C above pre industrial levels would have on the global environment. The scientists found: • By 2100, global sea level rise would be 10cm lower with global warming of 1.5C compared with 2C. • Extreme heatwaves will be experienced by 14% of the world's population at least once every five years at 1.5C. But that figure rises to more than a third of the planet if temperatures rise to 2C • Arctic sea ice would remain during most summers if warming is kept to 1.5C. But at 2C, ice free summers are 10 times more likely, leading to greater habitat losses for polar bears, whales, seals and sea birds. • If warming is kept to 1.5C, coral reefs will still decline by 70-90% but if temperatures rise to 2C virtually all of the world's reefs would be lost Figueres said the need for urgent action was clear: “Emissions reductions today are much more important than emissions reductions tomorrow. The sooner we bend the curve of global emissions, the more options we will have on the table for safely reaching the necessary, desirable and achievable carbon neutrality by 2050.” The decisions taken in the next few years will be crucial because the investment cycle for power plants and transport systems is at least 10 years. Infastructure built now will continue to burn up carbon for decades to come if it is not re-engineered. “This is the decisive decade,” said Johan Rockström, chief scientist at Conservation International and co-author of the recent Hothouse Earth report, which warned of a domino-like cascade of melting ice, warming seas, shifting currents and dying forests beyond which human efforts to reduce emissions will be increasingly futile. “Any investment in energy has a 10-year lifecycle. Even a family car: 1.5C has become real.” “Climate change is occurring earlier and more rapidly than expected. Even at the current level of 1C warming, it is painful,” he told the Guardian. “This report is really important. It has a scientific robustness that shows 1.5C is not just a political concession. There is a growing recognition that 2C is dangerous.” Business leaders and investors pledged their support. The Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, representing financial investors with $21tn in assets, called on governments to provide the framework necessary to spur greater finance. “The IPCC has delivered a stark message. To limit global warming to 1.5C requires an urgent acceleration in the pace at which we are moving to a low-carbon economy,” said Stephanie Pfeifer, the group’s chief executive. “Governments now have to raise their ambition levels to implement the Paris agreement and provide the signals required for the clean energy transition.” Peter Bakker, the president of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, added that the effort would require “unprecedented funding and coordination”, with the private sector playing a key role. “It’s time to put real money next to real solutions, [with] different players from different sectors together driving forward.” Politicians are expected to respond later this year, when governments meet in Poland in December to flesh out the ways of meeting the goals set out in the Paris agreement. Progress on this step of implementing the agreement has been slow so far, the UN has warned. Although all of the world’s functioning governments are signed up to the Paris goals, the US under President Trump has begun its withdrawal, making it harder for supporters of the agreement to move forward in the talks. Jim Hansen, the former Nasa scientist who testified on climate change to the US Congress in 1988, the year the IPCC was formed, told the Guardian: “I have faith that they will act, eventually. The US, which has done twice as much as any other nation to create the excess CO2 in the air today, is the key. The executive and congressional branches will not, on their own, solve the problem. The courts will have to force the other branches of government to be responsible.” Rockström said the political shifts in some countries should be met with a counterbalancing move in others. “Every time we get leaders in the US or Brazil taking a step back then others, particularly in Europe, should take a step forward.” The UK is set to continue to pursue the Paris targets after Brexit, when the country’s emissions cuts will no longer count towards the EU goals. “There is now no excuse and real action is needed,” said Claire Perry, the minister for energy and clean growth. “This [IPCC] report should act as a rallying cry for governments around the world to innovate, invest and raise ambition to avert catastrophic climate change.” The government is set to ask the Committee on Climate Change to advise on how the UK can meet its share of the emissions cuts needed to avoid 1.5C of global warming. The committee’s targets are binding on ministers. Civil society groups are also piling pressure on policymakers to turn warm words into action. “The difference between impossible and possible is political leadership,” said Stephen Cornelius, chief adviser on climate change at WWF. “We are already seeing loss of natural habitats and species, dwindling ice caps, rising sea levels, impacting on our health, livelihoods and economic growth. We know what is needed and we can do it relying mostly on proved technologies, such as decisively scaling up renewable energy and halting deforestation.” Rachel Kennerley, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, added: “Just like ignoring credit card statements, so that repayments only become sharper and steeper, this report shows that weak responses will make it harder in the long run.”"
"One of the biggest hubs of real-time climate research is a lab hundreds of miles from the rising seas and melting ice caps. There are no test tubes or beakers. Instead young scientists and economists hunch over computers analyzing the newest data. A group of them are currently reviewing a study that considers whether crime levels are connected to monsoon seasons. The findings are a tiny part of a big question: how much is climate change costing society, and who’s paying?  “Each time we use energy from fossil fuels, we are causing some kind of cost on someone who’s not involved,” said Amir Jina, a professor at the University of Chicago and member of the Climate Impact Lab. “By causing that damage we’re essentially taking money away from them because of some interaction, whether it’s driving our cars or turning on our light switches.” The world is far off track to limit catastrophic climate change and needs to undertake unprecedented changes within the next 12 years to avoid the worst of warming, according to international scientists. Barring a radical transformation in how people live, temperatures will continue to rise and climate costs will grow. The Climate Impact Lab wants to know how much they will increase and how dangerous the planet will become. “There’s been a change in urgency in how we discuss things,” said Jina, who was an early student of this project to meld climate science and economics. “People are starting to shift to think of it as not just what happens to the natural world and here’s what happens with this problem, but what the implications are for people.” From the effects of heat on worker productivity to suicide surges following crop losses, the lab is tallying the damages that don’t make the evening news. In addition to the University of Chicago, it also operates out of the University of California at Berkeley, the economic research firm Rhodium Group and Rutgers University. “A lot of academia is writing a paper and hoping someone notices and putting it on a shelf next to another paper, and those papers can be really valuable but we’re trying to step back and say, ‘together, what do all of these things mean for policy?’” said Tamma Carleton, a postdoctoral scholar working with the lab. Carleton studies deaths and crime related to climate change, as well as internal and international migration. In one study from India, she found that when heat damages crops during the growing season, there are more suicides. When it’s hotter than 20C, each degree increase in a single day means about 70 people kill themselves. Carleton estimated warming has been responsible for 59,300 suicides in India over 30 years. Another study co-authored by a Climate Impact Lab member found that higher temperatures increase suicide rates in the US and Mexico too. “Any death is important, but when it’s suicide I think it’s a really important indicator of human hardship,” Carleton said. Anant Sudarshan, the South Asia director of the University of Chicago’s Energy Policy Institute, has other startling findings about what extreme heat means for India. His research found that on hot days, productivity at manufacturing plants declines 4% to 9% for every degree increase in temperature. When it is very hot for several days, people stop going to work. Warming between 1971 and 2009 may have decreased output in India by 3%. Companies in India are using the data to determine whether to buy expensive air conditioners, hire more people, shift to automation or just take the hit, Sudarshan said. Sudarshan said the observations aren’t just relevant to India. “We’re trying to say you should be concerned even if you’re not in a developing country,” Sudarshan said. “It’s not so clear we won’t see that in many places.” In the US, officials rolling back climate rules have stopped counting the global benefits of efforts to curb climate change. In one case, they argued that each ton of carbon pollution costs society as little as $1, far less than what most experts think is accurate. The Climate Impact Lab will use a supercomputer to look at daily climate data for 25,000 regions, to come up with an updated number and to tell people what climate change will mean on the local level. Michael Greenstone, the codirector of the lab, who helped calculate the social cost of carbon pollution under the Obama administration, said he was frustrated that science could only tell people how much temperatures would rise on average or what that would mean for the global economy. “That doesn’t tell anybody in Louisiana what’s going to happen to their life. They’re not the global average. It’s not interesting to them,” Greenstone said. The University of Chicago covered this reporter’s travel expenses to moderate an event on campus but had no input on this reporting."
"If George Monbiot really wants to get people talking about the connection between climate change and the economy, he’d do better to find a different question to “how do we stop growth?” (While growth continues we’ll never kick our fossil fuel habit, 26 September). The elephant in the room is the assumption that nature’s resources and capabilities are so large that they can be considered infinite and so excluded from the economic cost of production. This has the unintended consequence of rewarding destruction. Hence the German situation in Hambacher: the lignite has value because it can be sold to be burned, the 12,000-year-old forest has none unless the trees are cut down for economic use. And, in an infinite world, there are always more 12,000-year-old forests.  This form of thinking might have been a useful simplification when human population and activities were at the levels of the Enlightenment, when much of the philosophy that still drives the economy was developed. Indeed, for any one individual the world is still a remarkably big place and it is difficult to imagine it running out of anything. But a resource that would have supplied an Enlightenment-sized population for 500 years would last today’s just 35 years. And that is without considering increased rates of consumption. Maybe the better question is: how do we rewrite the rules of our economy to reward activities that nourish our future rather than those that destroy it?Harold ForbesWareham, Dorset • With reference to George Monbiot’s article and Sébastien Thibault’s brilliant illustration may I make two suggestions: first, that cycling in the UK is made much more user-friendly – at present only the most intrepid would dare to cycle on our roads, whereas in Holland cycling is an option for all ages, shapes and sizes, not just Lycra-clad athletes; second, when resources are scarce, it makes sense to introduce a fair system of rationing. I remember the rationing of food, clothing and fuel in the 1940s. It was tiresome but necessary and it ensured that no one in UK starved. Rather than destroy our environment, we need to introduce a system of mileage rationing for people using modes of transport which run, directly or indirectly, on fossil fuels. I don’t believe it is a basic human right to be able to jet here, there and everywhere with no restrictions.Jill GreerChadlington, Oxfordshire • George Monbiot is right. It takes a peculiar form of obstinacy for news channels such as the BBC to consistently not mention climate change. Last week, for example, Jeremy Corbyn committed the Labour party to a huge investment in green technology coupled, to zero carbon emissions by 2050. This was ignored in favour of yet more pointless debates about Brexit. Future generations will look back on the present era with a profound sense of disbelief that the Kardashians command 200 times more airtime than climate change does; and that the media’s obsession with Brexit resembles a pack of vultures fighting over a dead carcass from which every item of interest has long since been stripped bare.Dr Robin Russell-JonesChair, Help Rescue the Planet • George Monbiot is right (again). But is there any chance he could get together with, say, Owen Jones, Caroline Lucas and Justin Welby, to tell us how, practically, to get from where we are to where we should be, without catastrophic unemployment, poverty and civil unrest?Philip Hall Cotford St Luke, Somerset • Re climate change, “be the change you wish to see in the world”. Stop driving fossil-fuel cars. Become vegetarian. Consume less. Use less energy. Do not follow fashion. Do not upgrade phones with every new model. Buy products, including clothes, furniture and household items to last. Recycle everything: plastic, glass, metal and organic matter. Take furniture, clothes, DVDs, CDs and everything else that is still usable to charity shops.Neil SinclairEdinburgh • George Monbiot considers the mismatch, between economic growth and environmental sustainability, on a global scale. At an individual level, we all need to forget what everyone else might be doing, and tailor our activities and consumption to much reduced totals. This has to mean a much simplified lifestyle: being happy with our personal relationships, reducing most forms of competition, and devoting our time to caring for other members of society. It means a fundamental change of attitude to everyone else. At a political level, we need to replace competitive politics with cooperative politics. Left and right politics is redundant, as are most of our politicians. As Larry Elliott once said in a related context, “best of luck with that”.Martin LondonHenllan, Denbighshire • George Monbiot is of course quite right. But why will he not take his argument to its logical conclusion? There is one overarching problem which is behind all the others: it subsumes global warming, pollution, the ozone hole, shortages of basic ingredients. It is the population problem: quite simply, there are too many of us. Someone, I forget who, has suggested that if everyone on earth had a European standard of living we would need about three planets to sustain us (five for a North American standard). Some people get very exercised over the thought that there might be 9 or even 10 billion of us by 2050. That is the wrong concern: they (and we) should worry about the 7 billion we have now. I believe that it is not enough to slow or stop population growth; we need to reverse it – drastically, and fast – but this obviously raises some unpleasant decisions. The time to start thinking is now.Tim GosslingCambridge • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

"MEPs have voted for a 40% cut in car emissions by 2030, in a rebuke to more cautious proposals by the European commission that signals tough negotiations with national governments ahead. Germany has strongly opposed any increase to the 30% cut in CO2 output proposed by the European commission, although countries such as France have yet to reveal their position.  While the MEPs’ target – along with a 20% milestone agreed for 2025 – would still overshoot the Paris agreement’s objective of holding global warming to 1.5C, it was welcomed by the Dutch Green MEP Bas Eickhout. “We cannot compromise our climate ambition because certain governments and the commission act as lobbyists for the car industry,” he said. “In upcoming negotiations, the parliament must stand firmly by its newly agreed targets.” British Conservative MEPs voted against the 40% goal despite a government instruction, seen by the Guardian, that welcomed the proposal as being in line with UK policy. The Conservative MEP John Procter said: “We are concerned a 40% target, tied to punitive penalties, may be a step too far at this stage and further threaten jobs.” Officials suggested the ECR’s positioning could strengthen the UK’s hand in negotiations. However, it was condemned as “a total sham” by the Liberal Democrat MEP Catherine Bearder. “Do they seriously expect us to believe their government’s promise of a green Brexit after this?” she asked. In a sign of battles to come, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (Acea) said the timetable for the changes might be too tight to meet. Acea’s secretary general, Erik Jonnaert, said: “We remain particularly concerned about the extremely aggressive CO2 reduction targets and the imposition of sales quotas for battery electric vehicles that MEPs have backed. Today’s vote risks having a very negative impact on jobs across the automotive value chain.” The MEPs’ decision followed a Danish ban on the sale of automobiles using fossil fuels, announced on Monday, also due to take effect from 2030."
"Fracking protesters have been sent to prison for the first time. It reeks of desperation from the industry and a clampdown on the right to protest. In 2013 I was arrested in Balcombe, West Sussex, for peacefully blockading a fracking site in solidarity with the local community. The charges against me were dropped, but today, for the first time ever, a judge sent three protesters to prison for doing the same thing in Lancashire. All charges relating to over 350 previous acts of non-violent direct action at Preston New Road since work started in January 2017 have led to fines or community service. But, as Cuadrilla prepares to start fracking within weeks, the police have pursued the most severe charge and sentencing possible.  Where I was charged with obstruction in Balcombe, these men are now serving time under the complicated and archaic charge of public nuisance. And their incarceration is part of a wider clampdown on protest. This year the UK is “celebrating” the suffragettes and 100 years since women won the right to vote – but the government’s triumphant narrative glosses over the radical and law-breaking tactics these brave campaigners had to pursue in the name of what was right. And ministers are overseeing a growing trend for draconian injunctions and disproportionate charges against people standing up for what they believe in. In Sheffield last year, Green party councillor Alison Teal was arrested for peacefully preventing unnecessary tree-felling in the city. Next week 15 people will go to court facing terrorism charges for a peaceful protest that grounded a chartered deportation flight. The law they are accused of breaking has never been used against activists before and could see them sentenced to life in prison. The case of the anti-fracking protesters jailed today goes back to July 2017, when a convoy of lorries delivering drilling equipment to the Preston New Road fracking site was spontaneously brought to a halt by protesters. Four men – including a piano restorer, a teacher and a soil scientist – climbed on top of the cabs of the lorries and between them stayed there for four days. During the seven-day court case the defendants weren’t once allowed to contextualise their actions. They were told they couldn’t talk about why they were concerned about fracking, or explain that many people in the community welcomed being mildly inconvenienced if it delayed and deterred the much greater threat of fracking and climate change. These men were standing up for all of us against a dangerous government policy – but they were treated as thoughtless criminals. Now three of them are in prison. A year after the men were arrested and hours before parliament’s summer break, the government quietly granted permission for fracking to go ahead at the Preston New Road site. That same summer break brought some of the most violent impacts of climate change we have ever seen. A global heatwave brought record-breaking temperatures, raging wildfires from Sweden and Manchester to Greece and California, and heat-related deaths in several countries. The government’s decision to launch a whole new fossil fuel industry while forest fires burned in the Arctic circle was an unforgivable and reckless act that can only worsen the climate breakdown already impacting millions of people around the world. And while their voices were silenced in court, ministers are silencing the rest of us in our communities. In defiance of democracy and an attempt to bypass the effective resistance of local people to protect their homes and countryside, the government is now planning to force fracking through without consulting local residents. But these proposed changes and the harsh treatment of protesters tell us something – we are winning the fight against fracking. Five years after former chancellor George Osborne embarked on his “Dash for Gas”, Cuadrilla hasn’t been able to get the industry off the ground. Its counterpart in Yorkshire, Third Energy, couldn’t muster the financial backing to get consent for fracking, and has since packed up its operation at Kirby Misperton. Now, on top of national opposition and local resistance, MPs from across parliament are joining the campaign against plans to force fracking on communities without their consent. In the same way I did, the protesters jailed today took action as a last resort – following a call for help from a community overruled by ministers in Westminster. As momentum against fracking grows and the industry limps forward with the help of a government willing to defy its electorate, we owe it to these men behind bars to stand with the local community and stop this industry once and for all. • Caroline Lucas is co-leader of the Green party of England and Wales, and the MP for Brighton Pavilion"

"We’re getting there, aren’t we? We’re making the transition towards an all-electric future. We can now leave fossil fuels in the ground and thwart climate breakdown. Or so you might imagine, if you follow the technology news. So how come oil production, for the first time in history, is about to hit 100m barrels a day? How come the oil industry expects demand to climb until the 2030s? How is it that in Germany, whose energy transition (Energiewende) was supposed to be a model for the world, protesters are being beaten up by police as they try to defend the 12,000-year-old Hambacher forest from an opencast mine extracting lignite – the dirtiest form of coal? Why have investments in Canadian tar sands – the dirtiest source of oil – doubled in a year?  The answer is, growth. There may be more electric vehicles on the world’s roads, but there are also more internal combustion engines. There be more bicycles, but there are also more planes. It doesn’t matter how many good things we do: preventing climate breakdown means ceasing to do bad things. Given that economic growth, in nations that are already rich enough to meet the needs of all, requires an increase in pointless consumption, it is hard to see how it can ever be decoupled from the assault on the living planet. When a low-carbon industry expands within a growing economy, the money it generates stimulates high-carbon industry. Anyone who works in this field knows environmental entrepreneurs, eco-consultants and green business managers who use their earnings to pay for holidays in distant parts of the world and the flights required to get there. Electric vehicles have driven a new resource rush, particularly for lithium, that is already polluting rivers and trashing precious wild places. Clean growth is as much of an oxymoron as clean coal. But making this obvious statement in public life is treated as political suicide. The Labour party’s new environment policy, published this week, rightly argues that “our current economic model is threatening the foundations on which human wellbeing depends”. It recognises that ecological collapse cannot be prevented through consumer choice or corporate social responsibility: the response to our greatest predicament must be determined by scientific research, and planned, coordinated and led by government. It pledges “to meet the Paris agreement goal of limiting global temperature rises to no more than 1.5C”. But, like almost everyone else, it ignores the fundamental problem. Beyond a certain point, economic growth – the force that lifted people out of poverty, and cured deprivation, squalor and disease – tips us back into those conditions. To judge by the devastation climate breakdown is wreaking, we appear already to have reached this point. The contradiction is most obvious when the policy document discusses airports (an issue on which the party is divided). Labour guarantees that any airport expansion must adhere to its tests on climate change. But airport expansion is incompatible with its climate commitments. Even if aircraft emissions are capped at 2005 levels, by 2050 they will account for half the nation’s carbon budget if the UK is not to contribute to more than 1.5C of global warming. If airports grow, they will swallow even more of the budget. Airport expansion is highly regressive, offending the principles of justice and equity that Labour exists to uphold. Regardless of the availability and cost of flights, they are used disproportionately by the rich, as these are the people with the business meetings in New York, the second homes in Tuscany, and the money to pay for winter holidays in the sun. Yet the impacts – noise, pollution and climate breakdown – are visited disproportionately on the poor. I recognise that challenging our least contested ideologies – growth and consumerism – is a tough call. But in New Zealand, it is beginning to happen. Jacinda Ardern, the Labour prime minister, says: “It will no longer be good enough to say a policy is successful because it increases GDP if it also degrades the physical environment.” How this translates into policy, and whether her party will resolve its own contradictions, remains to be determined. No politician can act without support. If we want political parties to address these issues, we too must start addressing them. We cannot rely on the media to do it for us. A report by the research group Media Matters found that total coverage of climate change across five US news networks (ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox and PBS) amounted to 260 minutes in 2017 – a little over four hours. Almost all of it was a facet of the Trump psychodrama (Will he pull out of the Paris accord? What’s he gone and done this time?) rather than the treatment of climate chaos in its own right. There was scarcely a mention of the link between climate breakdown and the multiple unnatural disasters the US suffered that year; of new findings in climate science; or of the impacts of new pipelines or coalmines. I cannot find a comparable recent study in the UK. I suspect it is a little better, but not a lot. The worst denial is not the claim that this existential crisis isn’t happening. It is the failure to talk about it at all. Not talking about our greatest predicament, even as it starts to bite, requires a constant and determined effort. Taken as a whole (of course there are exceptions), the media are a threat to humanity. They claim to speak on our behalf, but they either speak against us or do not speak at all. So what do we do? We talk. As the climate writer Joe Romm argued in ThinkProgress this year, a crucial factor in the remarkable shift in attitudes towards LGBT people was the determination of activists to break the silence. They overcame social embarrassment to broach issues that other people found uncomfortable. We need, Romm argues, to do the same for climate breakdown. A recent survey suggests that 65% of Americans rarely or never discuss it with friends or family, while only one in five hear people they know mention the subject at least once a month. Like the media, we subconsciously invest great psychological effort into not discussing an issue that threatens almost every aspect of our lives. Let’s be embarrassing. Let’s break the silence, however uncomfortable it makes us and others feel. Let’s talk about the great unmentionables: not just climate breakdown, but also growth and consumerism. Let’s create the political space in which well-intentioned parties can act. Let us talk a better world into being. • George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist"
"The Liberal candidate for Wentworth, Dave Sharma, said his party is “doing enough” and has “a good record” on climate change, after a blistering attack from former leader John Hewson, who said the party deserved a “drubbing” over its inaction on the issue. Hewson told Guardian Australia that Liberal voters have a unique opportunity: register a protest now and return to the party at the general election in six months’ time.  “I obviously disagree with John Hewson on this,” the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said as he campaigned with Sharma at an optometrist’s shop in Rose Bay on Wednesday. Frydenberg said a vote for an independent in Wentworth was as good as a vote for the Labor party. “It will bring uncertainty to the parliament and it will bring Bill Shorten one step closer to The Lodge,” Frydenberg said. Sharma also rejected Hewson’s assessment that the Liberal policy on climate change was inadequate. “I do think we are doing enough and I do think we have had a good record on climate change. Emissions are at their lowest levels in 28 years,” he said. Sharma was referring to emissions as a proportion of GDP not absolute emissions. “We are on track to meet the Paris commitments and I believe we will address the Paris commitments and we will be addressing affordability and sustainable and coherent energy policy,” he said. Hewson has accused the Liberals of putting their heads in the sand on the issue and kicking the issue down the road for future generations. The former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull dropped plans for a national energy guarantee that would have imposed emissions reduction targets and then was dumped by his own party, which was deeply divided over his plan. Frydenberg defended the government’s record. He said emissions on a per capita GDP basis have come down to their lowest level in 28 years. But the economy has been growing and so too have overall emissions. Australia is on a trajectory that will see it miss its Paris climate targets – a reduction of 26% to 28% based on 2005 levels – according to figures from the consultants, NDEVR Environmental, for the year up to the end of June 2018. The NDVER figures showed Australia’s emissions were again the highest on record when unreliable data from the land use and forestry sectors was excluded. This was the third consecutive year for record-breaking emissions. Despite this, Frydenberg claimed that the nation is on track to meet its Paris commitments – even without the Neg, which he had supported. He also lauded the Coalition’s record on investment in renewables. “Renewable energy investment has never been higher in Australia. Never been higher. Twenty per cent of Australian homes have solar panels on their roofs. We’ve seen large-scale renewable projects. We’ve got Snowy Hydro, the largest pumped hydro facility in the southern hemisphere,” he said. “These are Coalition achievements. These are Coalition initiatives. These are things that we should be proud of, rather than the rhetoric and the reckless targets and policies of Labor and the Greens,” he said. Asked about the IPCC report this week, which called for coal generation to be phased out by 2050 or the world would be facing a catastrophe, Frydenberg said it was their word, not ours. “Our policy is you need to do it in a way to reduce your carbon footprint in a way that is cost effective and that pays paramount importance to what the impact on the businesses and the households that rely on their energy for their sustainability, for their viability,” he said. He said coal and gas would need to remain part of the energy mix. Sharma did not offer an opinion."
"In the cloud of toxic dust thrown up by the Kavanaugh hearings last week, two new Trump initiatives slipped by with less notice than they deserve. Both are ugly, stupid – and they are linked, though in ways not immediately apparent. In the first, the administration provided the rationale for scrapping President Obama’s automobile mileage standards: because Trump’s crew now officially expects the planet to warm by 4C . In the environmental impact statement they say it wouldn’t make much difference to the destruction of the planet if we all keep driving SUVs.  The news in that statement is that administration officials serenely contemplate that 4C rise (twice the last-ditch target set at the Paris climate talks). Were the world to actually warm that much, it would be a literal hell, unable to maintain civilizations as we have known them. But that’s now our policy, and it apparently rules out any of the actions that might, in fact, limit that warming. You might as well argue that because you’re going to die eventually, there’s no reason not to smoke a carton of cigarettes a day. Meanwhile, reporters also discovered that the administration has set up what can only be described as a concentration camp near the Mexican border for detained migrant children, spiriting them under cover of darkness from the foster homes and small shelters across the nation where they had been staying. Not an extermination camp – these aren’t Nazis – but a camp that literally concentrates this “problem” in one place: a tent city in the middle of the desert. Schooling is not available there, as it was in the shelters they came from; instead the kids are given “workbooks that they have no obligation to complete. Access to legal services is limited.” That camp is linked to climate change because, first, it’s in a desert. If you searched high and low across the North American continent, you could barely find a place hotter and drier than Tornillo, Texas, where in June the average high is 96F and where, as one climate data source succinctly puts it, “there is virtually no rainfall during the year”. But the link goes much deeper. Most of those migrants are from Central America and Mexico, and they might as easily be described as refugees fleeing gang violence (much of it rooted originally in the US) and a changing climate. Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras first saw an outbreak of coffee rust linked to higher nighttime temperatures; the El Niño that began in 2015 led to years of unprecedented drought. Deep new droughts this summer wiped out more harvests: “total or partial loss of crops means that subsistence farmers and their families will not have enough food to eat or sell in coming months,” the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization warned. The author Todd Miller, writing in the Nation, described meeting men trying to jump a train in Guatemala headed north toward the border. “When I asked why they were heading for the United States, one responded simply, “No hubo lluvia.” (“There was no rain.”) This will, of course, get steadily worse in the years ahead – every climate forecast shows deserts spreading and water evaporating across the region. And of course more migration will follow, in every corner of the world. The World Bank predicts we may see 140 million climate migrants before long, and given the chaos that even a million people fleeing the (partially drought-fueled) crisis in Syria created, we better come to grips. Some of that migration will be internal – perhaps six million people will abandon their coastal property in Florida alone, according to recent reports. And much of it will be international, as people flee because their lives depend on it. Telling people to stay home is not an option – when there’s no water, or when the floods come each year, or when the sea rises into your kitchen, people have to leave. Period. And telling people to stay home is not a moral option, either. Because the climate chaos setting off waves of refugees is born above all from the unconstrained migration of carbon dioxide molecules from America over the last century. No wall can prevent the exhaust from our armada of oversized cars from raising the temperature in Mexico; if Guatemala could ship its changed climate back north it doubtless would, but it can’t. We have to realize that global warming stems from the fact that we are a world without atmospheric borders, where the people who have done the least to cause the problem feel its horrors first and hardest. That’s why, over the last half-decade, the environmental and migrant-rights movement have grown ever closer. The Trump years are a fantasy land where we pretend we can go on living precisely as in the past, unwilling even to substitute electric SUVs for our gas guzzlers, and able to somehow insist that the rest of the world stay locked in place as well. It’s impractical, it’s unfair, and when it ends up with camps for kids in the desert it’s downright evil."
"Following the UN’s report concluding carbon emissions need to be reduced massively and rapidly to prevent an average increase in global temperatures of more than 1.5C (Global warming must not exceed 1.5C, landmark UN report warns, 8 October), one quick and simple way in which the UK could make a start is by cutting the top speed vehicles can travel on motorways from 70 to 60mph. All cars operate most efficiently at a speed between 50 and 60mph. At the stroke of a pen we could ensure all vehicles on motorways are running far closer to their most efficient levels. It won’t save the world on its own, but it’s a cost-free and easy step to take that gets us moving in the right direction.Matt WheelerBushey, Hertforshire • It is increasingly evident how difficult it will be to stop global warming; the need is pressing, obvious and requires strong leadership from governments. But, incredibly, our government is planning to build a major road (the so-called expressway) between Oxford and Cambridge. Painful as it might appear, the time has come when we have to stop building new major roads altogether, anywhere. We have to slash use of roads and fossil fuels, not encourage them.  The proposed new road would exacerbate man-made climate change, leading to increased pollution with attendant health impacts. The impacts on the environment, climate, landscape and people living in the path of the road should rule it out. Any upgraded transport links between Oxford and Cambridge must instead be via a fast, efficient, high-capacity electrified rail line.Chris OsmanOxford • Your article (Air pollution and how to avoid it, G2, 8 October) omitted to mention the fact that reducing the number of journeys taken by car is an effective way of reducing exposure to toxic air. The level of toxicity inside a car is higher than that on the street. We need serious government action to deal with this public health menace but, meanwhile, you can go some way towards protecting yourself and your family, and reducing your emissions, by making the choice to drive less.Pam LauranceLondon • My return from the newsagent’s on Tuesday morning coincided with the school run. I walked past the last 12 of a long line of cars, the owners of which had arrived early to secure a parking spot before the arrival of most pupils and parents.

"The challenge of avoiding catastrophic climate breakdown requires “rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society”, according to a new IPCC report. Experts say that although the challenges are huge there is still time to create a thriving, sustainable future. The main focus is on the decisions facing governments around the world but the IPCC acknowledges the role individuals can play.  Here are some of the things people can do. Although individual choices and actions are important, experts say people need to unite if the scale of this challenge is to be met, making the political space for politicians and big businesses to make the necessary changes. Bill McKibben, a leading climate campaigner and founder of 350.org, argues that the most important thing people can do is come together to form movements – or join existing groups – that can “push for changes big enough to matter”, from city-wide renewable energy programmes to large-scale divestment from fossil fuels. According to a report earlier this year, avoiding meat and dairy products is the single biggest way to reduce your environmental impact on the planet. Relatively simple measures such as insulating lofts and draft-proofing doors and windows on a large scale would see a big drop in energy consumption. However, the UK government substantially cut the amount that energy companies are forced to spend on helping households with energy efficiency measures. All that money is now focused on helping fuel-poor households, with no incentive for better-off households to improve their energy efficiency. Switch to renewable energy wherever possible. In the UK, consider installing solar panels before April, when government incentives will end and the costs will increase for most people. Walk or cycle where possible and if not – and it is available and affordable – use public transport. If you need to go by car, consider an electric one. Buy fewer things and consume less. Recycle wherever possible and – even better – reuse things. Demand a low carbon option in everything you consume, from clothes to food to energy.  Many experts – including the IPCC – say there is still a chance to create a sustainable, cleaner and more equal global system. Individuals can hold politicians to account by supporting political parties that put the environment at the heart of their economic and industrial policies. However the IPCC is clear that the real challenge from its report is to politicians, political systems and corporations rather than individuals. Jim Skea, a co-chair of the IPCC working group on mitigation said the report had presented governments “with pretty hard choices”. “We have pointed out the enormous benefits of keeping to 1.5C, and also the unprecedented shift in energy systems and transport that would be needed to achieve that,” Skea said. “We show it can be done within laws of physics and chemistry. Then the final tickbox is political will. We cannot answer that. Only our audience can – and that is the governments that receive it.”"
"Chinese coal-fired power plants, thought to have been cancelled because of government edicts, are still being built and are threatening to “seriously undermine” global climate goals, researchers have warned. Satellite photos taken in 2018 of locations in China reveal cooling towers and new buildings that were not present a year earlier at plants that were meant to stop operations or be postponed by orders from Beijing. The projects are part of an “approaching tsunami” of coal plants that would boost China’s existing coal capacity by 25%, according to the research group Coalswarm. The total capacity of the planned coal power stations is about 259GW, bigger than the American coal fleet and “wildly out of line” with the Paris climate agreement, the group said in a new report. “This new evidence that China’s central government hasn’t been able to stop the runaway coal-fired power plant building is alarming – the planet can’t tolerate another US-sized block of plants to be built,” said Ted Nace, executive director of CoalSwarm, which is funded by international green groups and private donations. Many of the power stations date back to a 2014-16 surge when the regime permitting construction was devolved from Beijing to provincial authorities. That led to a threefold increase in permits being issued between 2013 and 2015. In response, during 2016 and 2017 the Chinese government ordered projects to be slowed down, postponed or cancelled. But satellite photos analysed by Coalswarm show many power stations have continued to be built, including the Huadian Nanxiong station in south-east China. Despite the government ordering the plant to be suspended in January 2017, two cooling towers had sprung up by March 2018. Other photographs show water vapour emerging from cooling towers where there was none before, such as at the Zhoukou Longda power station in central China, which indicatesa plant burning coal and generating electricity. Some plants seem to have been built but not connected to the grid, which Coalswarm said appeared to be officials using a “sleight of hand” to avoid busting the government-imposed cap on coal. China’s current five-year plan dictates that there should be no more than 1,100GW of coal by 2020, but the 259GW increase via new plants comes on top of 993GW of existing capacity. Coalswarm said that given China had about half the world’s coal power capacity the country’s “coal policies have an outsized effect on global climate prospects”. The group called on China to act quickly to cancel the projects."

"We are following a path that will ultimately take us to a 4C-warmer world. A hot state where it is unlikely that we can generate food, water and shelter for all citizens, where sea level rise will ultimately exceed 10 metres, and where social insecurity and widespread disease will very likely be universal. Along the way we will reach several critical tipping points. One such is at 2C – a scenario that may prompt the Earth system to shift from self-cooling by means of buffering emissions to self-warming, thereby putting us on a path to a “hothouse Earth”. At 3C we reach a point where extreme floods and droughts will force people to leave their homes; more powerful hurricanes will destroy urban infrastructure.  In order to keep climate change in check, the Paris agreement committed countries to limit the increase of global mean temperature to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels, with the aim of reaching 1.5C. We are currently at about 1C. To explore the feasibility of this target, UN member states commissioned the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to produce a new 1.5C report. This report, seen by many as a concession to the grave threats low-lying island states face due to severe climate risks, has now gained more traction than previously anticipated, mainly because of mounting evidence that droughts, floods, heatwaves and storms strike earlier with higher frequency and severity than initially predicted. The latest science indicates that already at a range of global warming of 1-2C, humankind is at risk of triggering an irreversible loss of Arctic sea ice, losing all tropical coral reefs, and destabilising the Greenland ice sheet. The IPCC report not only assessed the climate risks but also the economic and technical challenges of stabilising global warming at 1.5C. The challenges are enormous. They include decarbonising all sectors of the global economy in their entirety by 2050, rapidly phasing out fossil fuels in the power sector and channelling large-scale investments into technologies that allow us to absorb carbon from the atmosphere. A key number in the new report regards the estimates of the remaining carbon budget, ie how much more greenhouse gas emissions can be allowed in order to have a chance of keeping global warming at 1.5C. The IPCC calculates a slightly higher remaining carbon budget compared with its previous calculations. These estimates are complex and depend on many assumptions, such as the trajectories of other greenhouse gases and cooling pollutants and the recalibration of the historical reference temperature on Earth before the industrial era. The slightly wider range of carbon budgets in this report compared with earlier reports – adding a few hundred gigatonnes of CO2, or three to seven years of emissions – is a reflection of the complexities involved. But rest assured, the conclusion is crystal-clear. However we twist and turn our data, at current rates of emissions the world has less than 10 years left to remain within the limits of a carbon budget to stand any chance of halting global warming at 1.5C. It would therefore be a mistake to construe the report as implying that credible climate action can be postponed even longer owing to a higher carbon budget. Countries like Pakistan, Bangladesh, Egypt, Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam are still investing heavily in coal-fired plants. Even Germany, once touted as a leader in combating climate change, has invested in new coal-fired plants over the last decade. Japan, too, has decided to invest significantly in coal since the Fukushima nuclear event. The already existing and planned coal-fired plants would roughly emit 330 gigatonnes of CO2 over their economic lifetime, which always exceeds 15 years. They alone would exhaust almost the whole available carbon budget for the 1.5C scenario. Investment decisions have to be reversed now, otherwise the world economy will be locked in to a carbon-intensive pathway. To avert this, the right policies must be put in place immediately. The climate summit in Katowice, Poland, in December will conclude that the voluntary contributions of the governments are currently insufficient to put the world on a 2C, let alone 1.5C, trajectory. Policies to intensify efforts are necessary. All nations need to revise their mitigation targets to accommodate the more rapid emission reductions required to truly stay well below 2C. New global policies are needed. One such policy would be a carbon price starting around €30 per tonne of CO2, which would very likely render investments in coal-fired plants unprofitable. Zero-carbon mobility, such as electric cars, could then become an attractive option as consumers would expect an increasing carbon price, and the internal combustion engine would gradually be phased out. Admittedly, there is a significant gap between actual carbon prices and those required to achieve ambitious climate change mitigation. The gap can be closed, however, by enhancing the legitimacy and popularity of carbon pricing by using its revenues to fund research and development for zero-carbon solutions, cutting taxes or propping up the welfare state. These revenues could, moreover, be used in developing countries for low-carbon infrastructure investments. Carbon pricing would be a credible signal to investors that governments are willing to act now. Governments, policymakers and civil society should heed the warnings of the IPCC report and take action immediately. • Ottmar Edenhofer and Johan Rockström are the directors of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research."
"Carbon emissions from the energy sector are on track to grow for the second year running, in a major blow to hopes the world might have turned the corner on tackling climate change. Preliminary analysis by the world’s energy watchdog shows the industry’s emissions have continued to rise in 2018, suggesting that an increase last year was not a one-off. The finding comes as the world’s leading climate scientists issue a landmark report on whether the world can meet a tougher global warming target, of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C. Dr Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency (IEA), told the Guardian: “When I look at the first nine months of data, I expect in 2018 carbon emissions will increase once again. This is definitely worrying news for our climate goals. We need to see a steep decline in emissions. We are not seeing even flat emissions.” Emissions largely flatlined in 2014–16 after climbing for decades, raising hopes that global action on climate change was beginning to turn the tide – but in 2017 they grew by 1.4%. The IEA would not say exactly how much emissions were up this year, as it will not publish official figures until March 2019, but confirmed they had definitely risen to a historic high so far. Indications that the trend has continued and was not a blip means the Paris climate deal’s target of keeping temperatures well below 2C – let alone the 1.5C being discussed this week – looks increasingly out of reach. Birol said the growing carbon pollution was a result of the global economy driving coal, oil and gas use. “Energy efficiency improvements and renewables are not good enough to reverse that,” he added. A new report by the IEA, published on Monday, predicted that renewables will grow rapidly in the next five years. Wind, solar and other renewable sources are expected to grow their share of global electricity generation from 25% in 2017 to 30% by 2023. Solar in particular is projected to make huge strides over the five years, accounting for as much new capacity as all other renewable power technologies combined. In 2023, China is expected to have 40% of the world’s solar power capacity. But Birol made clear that the growth in renewables had to be accompanied by coal plant closures in Asia if dangerous climate change is to be avoided. “If there are no early [coal power station] retirements, more than two-thirds of the emissions [in 2040] are already determined today. Unfortunately a big chunk of the problem in my view is the coal in Asia.” The IEA’s annual renewables report shows China and the EU will be the two biggest leaders on renewables in coming years. While the watchdog does not name Donald Trump and his rolling back of Barack Obama’s green energy blueprint, it cites US tax, trade and energy plan changes as causing “downside forecast uncertainties”. We expect energy-related CO2 emissions will increase once again in 2018 after growing in 2017 pic.twitter.com/rb0Em2folC Asked if the US was slipping behind because of Trump, Birol said: “Instead of blaming somebody I will say it is the result of a good policy in the EU. The US is still growing, especially on wind and solar, but the growth in other countries seem to be accelerating.” Overall, the IEA’s forecast is more optimistic than last year for renewables in the next five years, owing to policy changes and market developments in key countries. But prospects for the UK were revised downwards. The country is expected to increase its renewable electricity capacity more than a quarter by 2023, driven largely by new offshore windfarms. Solar has an incredibly cloudy outlook, with total new additions by 2023 expected to be around half what the UK installed in a single year in 2017."
"Stephen Lipp, who left New Orleans for Houston I grew up in New Orleans. When you’re brought up there you realize you’re below sea level: you see boats beyond the levee that are actually higher than you on the street. When Hurricane Katrina hit, we were prepared and realized we had to get out of Dodge. We headed to stay with family in Houston. I saw the pictures of the hurricane on and I thought: “Oh my gosh, everything I remember about this city has gone.” There was a TV shot of my neighborhood; instead of a boulevard, it was a bayou. I called the kids in and said: “I think we’ve lost everything. We’ve lost our lives there.” I decided to move on even before I saw my house. Going back to New Orleans just reaffirmed that. The whole city smelled of death, it was rotting. It was horribly depressing. The water was up to the eaves of our house and all we managed to salvage was half a briefcase of items. Everything else, my music, my books, my memorabilia, was gone. We moved to Houston. I managed to get a job in software development. We didn’t appear to be in harm’s way when Hurricane Harvey hit last year but I’ve never seen a flood of that magnitude before. Even as the water rose I thought: “This will peak soon.” But it rose, sat stable for a while, continued to rise and when it came into the house I thought: “This is crazy.” There was this intense feeling of denial, thinking about how this couldn’t happen again. There was a lot of shock and that night was hard – all the sewage was backing up, we had to stay on our beds to keep out of the water. We had friends nearby who got us out the next day in boats. There’s maybe one out of every five houses around here with a for sale sign because of the flooding now. I joke that towns should pay me to not move there in order to avoid being flooded. We will stay, though – I mean, the chances of being hit by a third storm are pretty slim. Things aren’t looking great for our planet but let’s face it, I’m not living on geologic time. Chantel Comardelle, relocating with entire community from the Louisiana coast Isle de Jean Charles is an island on the Louisiana coast that was settled by native American families who were pushed out of the city because they were native. It’s as far as you can go down the bayou, you don’t go there by accident. We have a very distinct culture. Our tribal family were fishermen, they lived off the land and traded with other communities. It was a close-knit community, everyone watched out for each other. We played stickball, did beadwork. I was born on the island but had to leave when I was four years old because a hurricane flooded our trailer and I became very sick. The doctor said I couldn’t go back because of the mold so we made the difficult decision to move to Houma. I noticed the changes when driving down to see family on the island. There used to be land on either side of the road and now it’s just open water. Everyone used to have gardens and now they don’t, the salt water kills everything. On the other side of the levee there was marsh but now it’s all water, it’s all going. A lot of younger people have moved away as you can’t put every house on 15ft stilts. You couldn’t get the school bus down the flooded road. [The tribe] made the decision to relocate and managed to get a grant from the federal government in 2016 to start that process. We looked through sites and we now have somewhere about 30 miles away – construction will begin be sometime at the end of next year for 150 lots. It’s very slow. It’s been frustrating and also scary because of the risk of hurricanes. The plan is to rebuild the community, make it what it was. There are still some people who are not ready to move, especially older people, and you have to be respectful of people’s wishes. My grandma is 92 and she’s never lived anywhere else but the island – for her to move to a new community is a big ask. We are called climate refugees, but I hate that term. “Refugee” suggests something with no clear plan or action but we have a clear plan and are doing this as a unified tribe. Most people believe we have to move because of climate change and also because the oil companies dug canals that allowed salt water to intrude further. It’s like we’ve hit the fast forward button on the environment. We will be the first ones to face this in the modern US but we won’t be the last. It’s important for us to get it right so other communities know that they can do it, too. Gaye Marie Thurmond, moved to safer ground in Houston I lived in the same house for 40 years with my late husband and children. They’ve grown up and gone now. We were flooded for three years in a row and Hurricane Harvey was absolutely the last straw. We were never in the flood plain before, never really flooded … and then, bingo. I think it’s because of the overdevelopment in Houston. We are near a gully and when the water backs up we flood because it’s flat here. I renovated and put the house up for sale after flooding in 2015, but when people heard it had been flooded they weren’t interested. We got 17 inches of water with Harvey. I think it gave me PTSD, my brain was in a fog. People are still suffering down here because of it. I stayed with a friend for eight months because I was flat-out homeless. Every room had to be gutted and replaced. I suffered a lot of loss, but others suffered much more. There was a [government-run] buyout program for flood-prone houses and I’d applied after the 2015 flood. Exactly one week before Harvey, I had the first monetary offer for my home. I didn’t have much time to think about it, we went back and forth, they said they’d pay for my moving costs and I thought: “I’m good, I’m done.” It was hard to walk away from a home where you raised your children and your husband had died. But I had to get somewhere away from the flood plain. I got somewhere in the north-west of the city, it doesn’t flood there. By the end I would’ve just accepted living in a tipi just to have my own place. I went back to the old house after they razed it. I bawled like a baby when I heard it had gone but I drove up to see it. It was beautiful. I had six pecan trees, a grapefruit tree – they had left them there next to the grass. It was like a pocket park. Anyone can enjoy that park now. Dan Kipnis, who is leaving Miami Beach I’m 68. My father bought a house in Miami Beach back in the day. Back then, it was pretty laid-back. Now, the development is crazy. I can’t believe they are still developing, they will still be building when they have water lapping at their feet. I’m now spending close to $20,000 a year on insurance because of the floods and the storms. The house is for sale because I want to get the value out of it before the shit hits the fan. I did list it for $3.2m, but it’s been on the market for two years and is now it’s down to $1.9m. I’m now spending close to $20,000 a year on insurance because of the floods and the storms I’m going to move to Palm Beach with my wife, rent an apartment and not give a shit if it floods because it’ll be a rental. I don’t care. I’ve been preaching about this problem for 15 years to try to wake people up. I want to get away from all the craziness, ripping up the streets to raise them, putting in new sewers, water pumps. The traffic is crazy. I am a boat captain and I first noticed something wasn’t right in about 1974. I saw that the barnacles were getting higher up the bridge pilings. Barnacles have to be in water all the time, and they were getting higher and higher, moving by inches. I used to catch snapper, groupers, Spanish mackerel, amberjacks. I had 11 people working for me. I don’t fish here any more because there’s so much algae in Biscayne Bay that it’s basically dead. The other boat captains know that the water covers the dock now and it didn’t before. But most of them voted for [Donald] Trump, they don’t care, they are very conservative people. It’s better to speak to the young people. It’s going to be much worse for them. We are really screwing them over. Laura Witham Spink, left Virginia Beach My husband was a navy officer at the base in Norfolk so we we moved to Virginia Beach, not too far away, in 1999. We have four children. In 2006 we moved to a bigger house in what was a very quiet neighborhood. By 2017 development was popping up everywhere, and I also noticed that there was flooding from heavy rains, just regular storms. Hurricane Matthew caused our home to be an island – the water came to the top of the car tires. After that the flooding became a nuisance and then a bit scary, we had to find a way around the water to find a way home. It flooded every time it rained. There were two roads into the neighborhood and when they were flooded we would park in the 7-Eleven and walk home. I kept rubber boots in the car. The city decided to put a four-lane road in front of where we lived and the flooding was only going to get worse, so we thought we should sell or we’d never get out of this place. It is a pretty place but has just been given over to developers. We made a loss on the house, sold it for $30,000 less than we paid for it. We never met the new buyer, no one ever asked about the flooding. They were from Virginia Beach so I’m surprised that they didn’t didn’t do their homework; I suppose they wanted a bigger house in a good school district. We waited for the last child to leave high school and we moved. We liked the character of Norfolk and it’s near my husband’s job. Norfolk floods too but they are proactive about it – we did our research. We have spent six months renovating so we are here for good. I’m not sure insurance will always be available if we went anywhere else on the coast."
"Two countries have halted their funding to the UN Environment programme following sharp criticism of its leader’s frequent flying in a draft internal audit. The audit also said Erik Solheim, a former Norwegian environment minister, had “no regard for abiding by the set regulations and rules” and had claimed unjustified expenses. Now, Denmark and Sweden have frozen their funding until the audit is finalised.  Concern over Solheim’s activities is also growing in Nairobi, where the UN Environment programme (Unep) is based, with the UN staff union there calling some of the findings in the draft audit “mind blowing”. A prominent climate scientist has also criticised Solheim’s globetrotting as “obscene CO2 hypocrisy”. Solheim spent $488,518 (£371,100) in 22 months and was travelling 80% of the time, according to the audit. Solheim said he had already paid back money for instances of oversight and made changes where other rules had been broken. On the frozen funding, first reported by Norway’s Aftenposten newspaper, he said it was “completely natural” for countries to wait for a final audit before releasing funds. Denmark’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) said it was withholding its 2018 contribution of about $1.6m to Unep. “The ministry is familiar with the criticism of Solheim’s travel activities,” an MFA spokeswoman told the Guardian. “We take this seriously. We are now awaiting the final audit report and its possible recommendations before we pay additional funds.” Sweden’s International Development Agency (Sida) said they would not approve any new funding until all the issues raised had been resolved. “Sida takes all signals of misuse of funds very seriously,” a spokeswoman said. Ole Jacob Sending, from the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs thinktank said he thought the freezing of funds was probably unprecedented. “There are many who don’t think Unep is functioning as it should, and that there are other means of promoting environmental issues that can be more effective,” Sending told Aftenposten. Some observers have praised Solheim for raising the profile of Unep. A Unep spokesman said: “We do not comment on the contributions of individual member states. However, UN Environment takes great pride in its reputation as both an environmental authority and trusted steward to our donors. As always, we remain in close consultation with every member state to ensure concerns are urgently addressed and resolved.” UN staff appear increasingly unhappy with Solheim’s leadership, claiming it is damaging Unep. A statement on Monday issued by Martin Njuhigu, president of the UN staff union in Nairobi, said: “The Union is deeply concerned ... Some items mentioned in the report are mind blowing. They require serious attention.” Prof Kevin Anderson, a climate scientist at the University of Manchester, UK, said deep and immediate cuts in global carbon emissions are needed to tackle climate change: “Despite this, there’s a cohort of climate glitterati for whom climate change is less a scientific and moral imperative, and more a vehicle for their own prosperity and prestige.” The draft audit, leaked to the Guardian, was compiled by the UN Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) and said Solheim’s extensive travel was “contrary to the ethos of carbon emission reduction” and was a “reputation risk to the organization”. It will be finalised after responses from the individuals named. Solheim said on Friday that he could not comment in detail on the audit until it was completed and published: “If any other mistakes are found, we will immediately correct them.” He said there was “excessive bureaucracy in the UN system” and that travelling was essential to his job: “Making good on our global agenda demands engagement with the world.” The Guardian can be contacted securely here or by email at damian.carrington@theguardian.com."
"The role of forests in combating climate change risks being overlooked by the world’s governments, according to a group of scientists that has warned halting deforestation is “just as urgent” as eliminating the use of fossil fuels. Razing the world’s forests would release more than 3 trillion tons of carbon dioxide, more than the amount locked in identified global reserves of oil, coal and gas. By protecting and restoring forests, the world would achieve 18% of the emissions mitigation needed by 2030 to avoid runaway climate change, the group of 40 scientists, spanning five countries, said in a statement.  “We must protect and maintain healthy forests to avoid dangerous climate change and to ensure the world’s forests continue to provide services critical for the well-being of the planet and ourselves,” the statement reads. The intervention comes as the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change gathers in South Korea ahead of Monday’s release of an eagerly awaited report on how the world can avoid warming of 1.5C (2.7F) beyond pre-industrial levels, an aspirational target of the landmark Paris climate deal in 2015. It is expected the report will focus on required changes to the energy system, rather than forests. “In responding to the IPCC report, our message as scientists is simple: Our planet’s future climate is inextricably tied to the future of its forests,” the scientists’ statement pointedly concludes. Trees and other vegetation currently absorb around a quarter of the CO2 humans are adding to the atmosphere, softening the potential impact of climate change. While the world won’t lose all of its trees, large tracts of tropical forests, which hold a vast amount of carbon, are still being lost in the Amazon, central Africa and Indonesia. Warming temperatures are also fueling huge fires in forests in higher latitudes, as witnessed this summer when much of northern Sweden was aflame. “The forest piece of the conversation is often lost and I don’t think the IPCC report will highlight it enough,” said Deborah Lawrence, a professor of environmental sciences at the University of Virginia and a signatory of the statement. “We almost take forests as a given but we lose forest every year, which means we are diminishing them as a carbon sink. “Deforestation has been massively reduced in the Amazon, but that hasn’t happened elsewhere. As countries get more peaceful in Africa we could lose more tropical forests, which really worries me.” The IPCC’s report is expected to mention the need for as-yet unproven technology to burn vegetation and bury the resulting emissions underground or directly suck carbon from the air as a way to meet the 1.5C target. The statement by Lawrence and other scientists warns the former strategy, known as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (Beccs), is untested and risks wiping out huge areas of rainforest in order to make way for plantation timber for energy. “It breaks my heart to think we’d lose half our tropical forests for plantations just to save ourselves,” Lawrence said. “It’s horrifying that we’d lose our biodiversity to avert climate change. Losing tropical forests is not somehow cheaper than putting up wind farms in the US or Sahara.” Lawrence said a steep drop in emissions to zero by 2040 would negate the need for “negative emissions” technology that would damage forests’ ability to suck up carbon, maintain local water supplies and weather patterns and provide a home for a riot of birds, mammals, insects and other creatures. “We will have a hotter, drier world without these forests,” Lawrence said. “There needs to be an international price on carbon to fund the protection of forests. And countries with tropical forests should maintain large chunks of forests to stabilize rainfall for agriculture and keep a predictable regional climate.” The prospects for averting at least 1.5C of warming appear dim, however, with a co-author of the upcoming IPCC report warning last week the world is “nowhere near on track” to meet its Paris commitments."
"An official United Nations grouping of 47 of the world’s poorest countries has urged Australia to “honour its international commitments” after the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said the country would not be “throwing money” into a key international climate change fund. Australia has previously pledged $200m to the Green Climate Fund (GCF), set up through the UN’s climate convention to help developing countries adapt to the impacts of climate change and cut their own greenhouse gas emissions.  But on Monday, in the hours before a major climate report was released, Morrison told radio presenter Alan Jones that Australia would not be “throwing money into some global climate fund”. One international climate expert said that geopolitically it was “mildly insane” that Australia was backing out of the GCF. In a statement to Guardian Australia, Ethiopian Gebru Jember Endalew, the chair of the Least Developed Countries (LDC) Group, said: “Funding from wealthy nations such as Australia is key to enabling an effective global response. “LDCs and other developing countries have made ambitious plans, but these plans cannot be implemented without sufficient tools and resources being mobilised. The Green Climate Fund plays an integral role in delivering these funds and continues to be underresourced.” The LDC Group represents 47 countries at UN climate negotiations and says its members are “specially vulnerable to climate change but have done the least to cause the problem”. African nations dominate the LDC group, alongside Pacific and East Asian countries Timor-Leste, Kiribati, Vanuatu and Tuvalu. Endalew said this week’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report showed “the science is crystal clear that limiting global warming to 1.5C is absolutely vital and that urgent, collective and unprecedented action is required by the international community”. He added: “Australia and other developed countries are yet to deliver on their collective commitment to mobilise a minimum of US$100bn annually by 2020 to support developing countries. The LDCs will continue to urge Australia to honour its international commitments for the safety and prosperity of present and future generations in Australia, in LDCs, and around the world.” Australian government ministers have been roundly dismissive of the findings of the IPCC report. Morrison dismissed the report’s relevance for Australia, saying it “deals with the global situation” and claimed, incorrectly, that the “same report” had backed Australia’s policies “only a year ago”. The latest IPCC report was one off and did not assess individual country policies. Morrison’s dismissive remarks about the GCF contrast with Australia’s previous enthusiastic support for the fund. In 2016, the then foreign minister, Julie Bishop, said Australia’s involvement with the GCF as a co-chair was “instrumental in gaining approval for major climate resilience investments” of US$1.3bn at that time. Chris Tinning, chief economist for development at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, is currently a GCF board member. A board meeting scheduled for 17 October in Bahrain with board documents showing it will consider $1.16bn in funding proposals. A GCF spokesman said: “We don’t comment on contribution policies of individual countries.” Dr Bill Hare, the Australian chief executive of respected international climate advisory group Climate Analytics, said the GCF was a “major instrument” that would help lever investments away from fossil fuels. He said: “In the Pacific, our neighbours are suffering from climate change and the damages they are experiencing are already quite confronting for anyone who cares to notice, and for them the GCF is a major source of resources to help them adapt and to reduce emissions themselves. “Geopolitically it is, to say the least, mildly insane for Australia at this moment in history in such a sensitive region so crucial to the country’s security, to back out of support for these island countries.” The former executive director of the UN’s climate convention, Christian Figueres, who led world to the Paris climate agreement, told the ABC on Tuesday that Australians faced a critical moment in history. “What do you stand for and what do you want history to remember you by,” she said, saying there were clear choices for Australia. “Do you want bushfires raging across the east coast for six months at a time, or do you want a thriving agricultural sector? Do you want the Great Barrier Reef, or the largest aquatic cemetery in the world?” She said Australia and coal was facing an important moment and that continuing a dependence on coal would deliver “dramatic loss of assets”. In comments reported in late September, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg indicated Australia had no plans to increase GCF funding, but a Department of Foreign Affairs spokesperson said at the time the government was considering “further contributions”.  On Thursday, a Dfat spokesperson said: “Australia is not planning to provide further funding to the Green Climate Fund (GCF).  We will continue to invest in climate change and disaster resilience through our existing development assistance budget, with a focus on the needs of our Pacific partners.” • This article was amended on 11 October 2018 to include the department’s response."
"Heatwaves and bushfires are predicted in southern Australia thanks to a 70% chance of El Niño weather conditions, the Bureau of Meteorology has warned. Although cyclones may ease up in the north by the end of the year, the outlook for drought-hit areas is not good, according to the bureau. “Between the [above average] temperature and the lack of rainfall, this is not good news,” climatologist Robyn Duell said. “This outlook on the back of such little rainfall and dry conditions makes it such a worry for people.”  Australia had endured its driest September since rainfall records began in 1900, Duell said. Despite rain in some areas in the past week, most of New South Wales and Queensland remain bone-dry. Drought conditions are worsening in parts of Victoria, where farmers are struggling to save their crops. NSW farmers have been hit hard by drought: 100% of the state is drought-declared, 34.3% is classed as drought-affected, 48.4% is in drought and 16.7% is in severe drought. Close to 60% of Queensland is in drought, and parts of the state have been dry for the past seven years. Farmers in drought-declared areas are eligible for relief payments and support services. El Niño is the part of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (Enso) characterised by weak trade winds over the Pacific, which reduce moisture and rainfall in eastern Australia. An El Niño is detected by a sustained fall in the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) to below –7. Sustained positive values above +7 typically indicate La Niña. Values between +7 and −7 generally indicate neutral conditions. “Any given year there is a risk because El Niño is a normal part of our climate system. We get an El Niño on average every two to five years,” Duell told the ABC. “That puts the risk at any given year at about a 25% chance. At the moment we’re looking at around a 70% chance. “This is absolutely not the type of outlook I think that many people would be hoping to hear.” The bureau outlook also noted that the the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), another key climate indicator, was trending positive, further contributing to the dry conditions. A positive IOD event typically reduces spring rainfall in central and southern Australia and can exacerbate any potential El Niño-driven rainfall deficiencies."
"New official data shows clearing of forests near and along the Great Barrier Reef continued despite Australian government pledges to protect the natural wonder, with at least 152,000 hectares felled in 2016-17 alone. Forests covering 770,000ha – an area about three times the size of the Australian Capital Territory – in the reef catchment zone have been bulldozed over the past five years. The area cleared last year was larger in size than that covered by new re-growth.  Jessica Panegyres, a nature campaigner with the Wilderness Society, said it showed Australia should be considered a global deforestation hotspot on a par with the Amazon and Indonesia. “The federal government has promised the world it is doing everything it can to protect the reef,” she said. “[It] has simply refused to act on deforestation, despite the major impacts on forests, wildlife, the reef and the climate.” The figures are included in the latest national greenhouse gas emissions accounts, which the government quietly released on Friday afternoon in the shadow of the AFL and NRL grand finals. They showed Australia’s emissions increased 1.3% in the year to March 2018, continuing a trend at odds with the government’s repeated claim it is on track to meet the target it set at the 2015 Paris climate conference. Deforestation increases nutrient and sediment run-off on to the reef coast, hurting water quality, stimulating algae growth and at times smothering corals. The government has spent billions addressing poor water quality, considered second only to climate change as a threat to the reef. The land-clearing data for 2016-17 is described as a projection and does not include part of the Fitzroy river region. It was released as the government postponed a decision on whether to allow a farmer to clear nearly 2,000ha of forest at Kingvale station on Cape York. The federal environment minister, Melissa Price, is considering an environment department recommendation that the clearing, approved at state level in 2013 under the former premier Campbell Newman, be allowed despite the presence of endangered species. Scientific advice to the government suggests allowing the Kingvale clearing would likely increase sediment run-off on to the reef. A decision is now due by the end of October. Land-clearing spiked in Queensland after the former Liberal National government relaxed laws preventing mass deforestation. The Palaszczuk Labor government passed new land-clearing laws to restore earlier protections in May, prompting protests from farmers who said they needed to manage vegetation to produce the food and fibre expected by consumers. Legacy clearing permits remain for about 115,000ha. Panegyres said Price could block outstanding permits using national environmental laws that empower the minister to intervene if threatened species were at risk or an activity was likely to have a significant impact on the reef. Price said state and territory governments were primarily responsible for regulating land-clearing. She said the government’s Reef 2050 plan, submitted to Unesco, was focused on improving the reef’s resilience to climate change by reducing local pressures. “We know climate change is a big issue for the reef and this is why we have invested over $400m to help protect the reef through the Great Barrier Reef Foundation,” she said. The minister said the emissions reduction fund, the central plank of Tony Abbott’s Direct Action climate policy, had incentivised a reduction in land-clearing. About $2.3bn of the $2.55bn taxpayer fund has been spent or committed. No new money has been allocated since 2014. More than $1bn from the fund had been used to pay for tree-planting and habitat restoration. Analysis of government data earlier this year found those emissions savings would effectively be wiped out by little more than two years of deforestation elsewhere in the country."
"After her house flooded for the third year in a row, Elizabeth Boineau was ready to flee. She packed her possessions into dozens of boxes, tried not to think of the mold and mildew-covered furniture and retreated to a second-floor condo that should be beyond the reach of pounding rains and swelling seas. Boineau is leaving behind a handsome, early 20th-century house in Charleston, South Carolina, the shutters painted in the city’s eponymous shade of deep green. Last year, after Hurricane Irma introduced 8in of water into a home Boineau was still patching up from the last flood, local authorities agreed this historic slice of Charleston could be torn down. “I was sloshing through the water with my puppy dog, debris was everywhere,” she said. “I feel completely sunken. It would cost me around $500,000 to raise the house, demolish the first floor. I’m going to rent a place instead, on higher ground.” Millions of Americans will confront similarly hard choices as climate change conjures up brutal storms, flooding rains, receding coastlines and punishing heat. Many are already opting to shift to less perilous areas of the same city, or to havens in other states. Whole towns from Alaska to Louisiana are looking to relocate, in their entirety, to safer ground. The era of climate migration is, virtually unheralded, already upon America. The population shift gathering pace is so sprawling that it may rival anything in US history. “Including all climate impacts it isn’t too far-fetched to imagine something twice as large as the Dustbowl,” said Jesse Keenan, a climate adaptation expert at Harvard University, referencing the 1930s upheaval in which 2.5 million people moved from the dusty, drought-ridden plains to California. This enormous migration will probably take place over a longer period than the Dustbowl but its implications are both profound and opaque. It will plunge the US into an utterly alien reality. “It is very difficult to model human behaviour under such extreme and historically unprecedented circumstances,” Keenan admits. The closest analogue could be the Great Migration – a period spanning a large chunk of the 20th century when about 6 million black people departed the Jim Crow south for cities in the north, midwest and west. By the end of this century, sea level rise alone could displace 13 million people, according to one study, including 6 million in Florida. States including Louisiana, California, New York and New Jersey will also have to grapple with hordes of residents seeking dry ground. “There’s not a state unaffected by this,” said demographer Mat Hauer, lead author of the research, which is predicated on a severe 6ft sea level increase. There are established migration preferences for some places – south Florida to Georgia, New York to Colorado – but in many cases people would uproot to the closest inland city, if they have the means. “The Great Migration was out of the south into the industrialized north, whereas this is from every coastal place in the US to every other place in the US,” said Hauer. “Not everyone can afford to move, so we could end up with trapped populations that would be in a downward spiral. I have a hard time imagining what that future would be like.” Within just a few decades, hundreds of thousands of homes on US coasts will be chronically flooded. By the end of the century, 6ft of sea level rise would redraw the coastline with familiar parts – such as southern Florida, chunks of North Carolina and Virginia, much of Boston, all but a sliver of New Orleans – missing. Warming temperatures will fuel monstrous hurricanes – like the devastating triumvirate of Irma, Maria and Harvey in 2017, followed by Florence this year – that will scatter survivors in jarring, uncertain ways. The projections are starting to materialize in parts of the US, forming the contours of the climate migration to come. “I don’t see the slightest evidence that anyone is seriously thinking about what to do with the future climate refugee stream,” said Orrin Pilkey, professor emeritus of coastal geology at Duke University. “It boggles the mind to see crowds of climate refugees arriving in town and looking for work and food.” Pilkey’s new book – Sea Level Rise Along Americas Shores: The Slow Tsunami – envisions apocalyptic scenes where millions of people, largely from south Florida, will become “a stream of refugees moving to higher ground”. “They will not be the bedraggled families carrying their few possessions on their backs as we have seen in countless photos of people fleeing wars and ethnic cleansing, most recently in Myanmar and Syria,” Pilkey states in his book. “Instead, they will be well-off Americans driving to a new life in their cars, with moving trucks behind, carrying a lifetime of memories and possessions.” Dejected with frigid New York winters, Chase Twichell and her husband purchased a four-bedroom apartment in Miami Beach in 2011, with the plan of spending at least a decade basking in the sunshine. At first, keeping a pair of flip-flops on hand to deal with the flooded streets seemed an acceptable quirk, until the magnitude of the encroaching seas became apparent when the city spent $400m to elevate streets near Twichell’s abode. Twichell began to notice water pumps were spewing plastic bags, condoms and chip packets into the bay. Friends’ balconies started getting submerged. Twichell, a poet, found apocalyptic themes creeping into her work. Last year, she sold the apartment to a French businessman and moved back to upstate New York. “It was like end of the world stuff,” she said. “It was crazy for us to have such a big investment in such a dangerous situation.” Her neighbours initially scolded her but now several are also selling up, fretting that the real estate and insurance markets for properties like theirs will seize up. “It was horrible but fascinating to see it,” Twichell said. “It’s like we got to see the future and it wasn’t pretty. It’s like a movie where there’s a terrible volcano that is destroying everything, only it’s much slower than that.” A sense of fatalism is also starting to grip some local officials. Philip Stoddard, mayor of South Miami, has seen a colleague, spooked by sea level rise, move to California and some neighbours sell their houses before an expected slump in prices. Stoddard and his wife regularly discuss buying a fallback property, perhaps in Washington DC. “Most people will wait for the problem to be bad to take action, that’s what I worry about,” he said. “We can buy a lot of time, but in the end we lose. The sea level will go over the tops of our buildings.” Sanitation is an immediate preoccupation for Stoddard, given the large proportion of residents who aren’t served by sewage works. “If you’re using a septic tank and your toilet starts to overflow into your bathroom because of water inundation, that’s a basis-of-civilization problem,” he said. “A medieval city wasn’t a nice smelling place and they had a lot of diseases.” Those living near the coasts will face pressures of the gradual (sea level rise) as well as dramatic (storms) nature but people inland will also be harried to move by climate change. Farming techniques and technology have improved immeasurably since the Dustbowl but rising temperatures are still expected to diminish yields for crops such as maize, soybeans and wheat, prompting the departure of younger people from farming. By 2050, Texas county, the largest wheat-producing county in Oklahoma, could spend an extra 40 days a year above 90F (32C) compared with now. A study published last year found that the economies of the southern states, along with parts of the west, will suffer disproportionately as temperatures rise. In what researchers called potentially one of the largest transfers of wealth in US history, the poorest third of counties are expected to lose up to 20% of their income unless greenhouse gas emissions are severely curtailed. Wealth, and potentially people, are expected to shift north and west. Meanwhile, cities already struggling with heat will see wealthy residents head for cooler climes. Last year, 155 people died in Phoenix due to a particularly fierce summer. Increasing heat will start testing the durability of the populace, even those shielded by air conditioning. In the western states, wildfires are getting larger, razing homes in ever more spectacular ways and choking thousands of people with carcinogenic smoke. Further to the south, at the border, there are suggestions that people from Central America are being nudged towards the US because of drought and hurricanes in their homelands, part of a trend that will see as many as 300 million climate refugees worldwide by 2050. “People will get very grumpy and upset with very hot temperatures,” said Amir Jina, an environmental economist at the University of Chicago who co-authored the research on economic losses. “Even if you have air conditioning, some areas start to look less habitable. By the middle of the century parts of the south-west and south-east won’t look attractive to live in. “That insidious climate migration is the one we should worry about. The big disasters such as hurricanes will be obvious. It’s the pressures we don’t know or understand that will reshape population in the 21st century.” Prodded to name refuges in the US, researchers will point to Washington and Oregon in the Pacific north-west, where temperatures will remain bearable and disasters unlikely to strike. Areas close to the Great Lakes and in New England are also expected to prove increasingly attractive to those looking to move. By 2065, southern states are expected to lose 8% of their US population share, while the north-east will increase by 9%. A recent study forecast that the population in the western half of the US will increase by more than 10% over the next 50 years due to climate migration, largely from the south and midwest. But these population shifts are uncertain and are bound by a tangle of other factors and caveats. People will still largely follow paths guided by nearby family or suitable jobs. Even those who do want to move may find favoured locations too expensive. Some will just grimly hang on. “With property rights as strong as they are in the US, some people may choose to go down with the ship,” said Harvard’s Keenan. “The question is whether they have the means and the options to do anything else.” “People can usually cope with being a little less comfortable, but if you see repeated storms or severe damage to crops, that will trigger change,” said Solomon Hsiang, who researches how climate change will affect society at the University of California. “There will be pressure to move a little north. It won’t be everyone, though, it won’t be like the great migration of wildebeest in Africa. Whole cities picking up and moving would be hugely expensive.” Smaller towns are giving relocation a go, however. In 2016, the community of Isle de Jean Charles in Louisiana was the first place to be given federal money to replant itself. The population, situated on an island being eaten away by the sea, is looking to move to a former sugar cane farm 30 miles inland. “We are called climate refugees but I hate that term,” said Chantal Comardelle, who grew up in the Isle de Jean Charles community. “We will be the first ones to face this in the modern US but we won’t be the last. It’s important for us to get it right so other communities know that they can do it, too.” About a dozen coastal towns in Alaska are also looking to relocate, as diminishing sea ice exposes them to storms and rising temperatures thaw the very ground beneath them. One, Newtok, has identified a new site and has some federal funding to begin uprooting itself. A buyout of damaged and at-risk homes has already occurred in New York City’s Staten Island in the wake of Hurricane Sandy, while certain flood-prone houses in Houston, pummeled by Hurricane Harvey last year, are also being purchased and razed. But the cost of doing this for all at-risk Americans would be eye-watering. Estimates range from $200,000 to $1m per person to undertake a relocation. If 13 million people do have to move, it seems fantastical to imagine $13tn, or even a significant fraction of this amount, being spent by governments to ease the way. “As a country we aren’t set up to deal with slow-moving disasters like this, so people around the country are on their own,” said Joel Clement, a former Department of the Interior official who worked on the relocation of Alaskan towns. “In the Arctic I’m concerned we’ve left it too late. Younger people have left because they know the places are doomed. These towns won’t be relocated within five years and I’m sure there will be a catastrophic storm up there. My hope is no lives will be lost.” Ultimately, the US will have to choose what it wants to defend and hope its ingenuity outstrips the environmental changes ranged against it. Not everyone will be able to shelter behind fortifications like the ‘big U’ planned to defend lower Manhattan. Wrenching decisions will have to be made as to what and where will be sacrificed. “We won’t see whole areas abandoned but neighborhoods will get sparse and wild looking, the tax base will start to crumble,” said Stoddard, mayor of South Miami. “We don’t have the laws to deal with that sort of piecemeal retreat. It’s magical thinking to think someone else will buy out your property. “We need a plan as to what will be defended because at the moment the approach is that some kid in a garage will come with a solution. There isn’t going to be a mop and bucket big enough for this problem.”"
"Late on Friday, under the cover of the release of the first interim report from the Hayne royal commission into the financial sector and the day before a weekend of AFL and NRL grand finals, the government released the latest quarterly data showing greenhouse gas emissions had once again risen. You can call this government many things – a bunch of dolts deluded into believing climate change is a global conspiracy, a bunch of feckless cowards lacking the intellectual ability or political acumen to stand up to those climate change-denying fools occupying positions on the backbench and in cabinet – but you can’t call them subtle. Ever since they have taken office from the ALP, this government has sought to release the quarterly greenhouse gas emissions data at times when it will most likely be lost in the news cycle. The usual favourite is the week before Christmas. The previous batch of data was released late on Friday of budget week. That it is now more than four months since that last “quarterly” release serves to highlight how planned this past Friday’s release was. The reason they choose to release the data at times when it is unlikely to get much attention is because the emissions data is continually awful and would be utterly shameful, were this government possessed of the ability to feel that emotion in relation to climate change. In the past 12 months the annual level of emissions reached a record level of 559m tonnes CO2-e if we exclude the controversial component of “land use, land use change and forestry” (LULUCF), which includes a measure for the amount of forest and grasslands and the amounts of those cut down or converted to other uses. Rather disgracefully Australia is allowed to count that use towards its Paris agreement to reduce emissions by 26% below 2005 levels. The reason this is disgraceful is because it means we are able to take into account the high amount of forest clearing that was occurring at the time, and to bank improvements merely due to us being less bad now than we were, not because we have actually improved our emissions. We did the same thing for our Kyoto commitment, which had 1990 as the base year – a year in which we had a massive amount of land clearing: But even if we include the LULUCF measure, our annual emissions rose in the past 12 months by 0.9% – and they are now at their highest level since 2011. It is a terrible result, but one that is not surprising given our emissions have been increasing every quarter since the end of the carbon price period in June 2014: The good news is electricity emissions have been falling recently, the bad news is so too has our level of renewable energy production. The only reason emissions in the national energy market have fallen is because of the drop in brown coal production: And the problem is while emissions from electricity have fallen since June 2016, in that time emissions from all other areas have increased by more than that amount: It’s the problem with focusing only on electricity emissions – they either need to come down by overly large amounts in order to meet our overall target, or we are not going to be able achieve it. The prime minster, when asked about the figures on ABC’s Insiders program parroted the inane media release that accompanied the data. Rather than focus on the overall increase in emission, the prime minister boasted that: “We’ve got emissions per capita at the lowest level in 28 years.” Whoop dee fricken doo. Is anyone shocked to discover that cars and equipment made now are more fuel-efficient than those made in 1990? Out of the past 28 years, only seven times have emissions per capita not declined. Not only is it a worthless boast, it says nothing about the impact on the environment. The atmosphere doesn’t react on a per capita basis, it reacts to the total level of CO2 emissions. Boasting about emissions per capita falling while total emissions are rising is like a general arguing that it doesn’t matter that the number of innocent civilians killed in bombing raids has increased in the past year because the average number killed per raid has fallen. At a political level it also doesn’t matter because our Paris commitment to reduce emissions to 26% below 2005 levels is total emissions, not per capita. But here again we find the prime minister in the land of obfuscation and outright fertiliser production. When Barrie Cassidy asked Morrison on Insiders if he still believed we would meet our 26% reduction target “in a canter” he replied that “people choose and pick their figures to make their political arguments. We’re going to meet those in a canter our 26% target … All of the issues are pointing to that outcome so I’m comfortable with our 26%.” So let us pause now as I choose to show the government’s own figures, which reveal not only that we are not going to make the 26% target in a canter, but instead by 2030 our emissions will be about 29% above the level they need to be: If the prime minister has some data in his back pocket that leads him to believe that “based on our assessments” Australia will meet its targets, maybe he could give those assessments to the Department of Environment and Energy so they can then publish them for all of us to see. Though, of course, given how the government hides its emissions data, they’ll probably publish it at a time for maximum exposure – say Christmas Eve at 4.50pm.  • Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist"
"Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions have continued to rise, but Scott Morrison seized on the silver lining, maintaining Australia would meet its Paris commitment, despite the government having no legislated instrument to help it get there. Figures released on Friday  showed Australia’s emissions increased 1.3% in the year to March 2018, up all sectors – except land use and electricity, where renewable technologies were having an impact on the latter.  The prime minister jumped on the rate of the increase not being as high as in previous years. “The emissions are at the lowest level in 28 years, and those figures, in particular for the March quarter, were based on some rather stronger LNG production figures for that period,” he told the ABC Insiders program. “So look, one swallow doesn’t make a summer, and I know that plenty of people will leap on that and say ‘you need to do X and Y’ and use those numbers for that purpose, but it means that we’re going to meet Kyoto 2 and we’ll smash that number. “We smashed Kyoto 1.” Morrison said Australia would meet its Paris targets “in a canter”, largely based on investment in renewable energy technologies, despite concerns a lack of legislated instrument may impact investor confidence in the sector. “The investments that are continuing to be made in renewables, on the basis of the fact, that, increasingly, we’ve hit the threshold point, where the investments make sense, increasingly, without subsidies,” he said. “We still have large-scale and small-scale policies there. We still have the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, and we still have the Emissions Reduction Fund for the period that it’s currently for, and we’re on track to hit it ... “I know people will want to use that one figure [1.3%] and ignore the fact that emissions per capita [are] at the lowest level in 28 years. Electricity sector emissions are down 13.9%, I think it is, on 2009, on the same figures. “So people choose and pick their figures to make their political arguments. We’re going to meet those in a canter.” Critics of the government’s stance have repeatedly called for legislation to ensure Australia meets the targets it agreed to when Tony Abbott signed the nation up to the Paris agreement. But with the national energy guarantee a casualty of the leadership spill within the Liberal party, the government has no legislated instrument to ensure emission reductions, and no plans to create one. Morrison said he did not believe that would impact Australia’s progress, citing government policy as being enough, despite repeated calls from interest groups, including the business lobby, to give certainty. “We’ll meet up in 2030 and we can argue the toss then,” he said, citing the deadline when Australia is due to meet its target of reducing emissions by 26% to 28% from 2005 levels. “None of us are Nostradamus in this but we have the policies in place and importantly, the technology, the demand management. All of the issues are pointing to that outcome so I’m comfortable with our 26%. I was comfortable with it when we set it, when I was part of the government that set it. And we’ll continue to pursue it.” He said lowering electricity prices remained the government’s priority and criticised Labor for its policy. “Labor has a 45% emissions reduction target – we all know what that will do,” he said. “It will put up electricity prices ... for every household in the country. Labor has that. We have a sensible target of 26%. We’ll stick to that and it won’t have an impact on electricity prices and we’ll continue our track record of delivering emissions reductions.” Labor has said it will look to legislate a version of the national energy guarantee the government abandoned as policy to ensure Australia does meet its targets. The Greens announced its parliamentary team will take a “hard line” on making sure any future Labor government does not back down. Research released earlier this month found that emission reductions targets were not responsible for driving up power prices."
"Better scientific understanding of global warming makes the discussion about its geopolitical consequences increasingly urgent. Put simply, there are going to be winners and losers: hotter places and colder places; wetter places and drier places; and, yes, places that disappear under the sea. But the reality is a bit more complicated. In particular, are sea levels going up or down? The answer seems clear when you consider that Antarctica has lost 3 trillion tonnes of ice in the last 25 years.  Yet to understand what is going on we first have to recognise that the Earth isn’t solid. It started life as a ball of hot liquid about 4.5bn years ago and our planet has been cooling ever since. Right at the centre of the Earth is a solid core of metal made of iron and nickel at a temperature of approximately 5,000C. But this core is surrounded by an approximately 2,000km-thick ocean of molten metal, again mostly iron and nickel. Surrounding this is a layer of rock called the mantle that is between 500C to 900C, and at these red-hot temperatures the rock behaves like a solid over short periods of time (seconds, hours, and days) but like a liquid over longer time periods (months to years) – so the rock flows, even though it is not molten. On top of the fluid mantle floats the crust, which is like the skin of the Earth. It is a relatively thin layer of cool rock that is between 30 to 100km thick and contains all the mountains, forests, rivers, seas, continents – our world. Since the crust is floating on the fluid mantle, if you increase its weight by, for instance, building up kilometres of ice on top of it, then it sinks further into the mantle. This is what has happened to the landmasses of Antarctica and Greenland, which are both covered in 2km to 3km of thick ice. If global warming were to cause all that ice to melt, then the sea level of the oceans would rise by more than 50 metres, submerging all the coastal cities of the world and making hundreds of millions of people homeless. This seems obvious. What is less obvious is how it might unfold. If the whole ice sheet covering Antarctica melts, the release of its weight will destress the rocks below, which, because they float on the mantle, will bob up. This is called post-glacial rebound. The position with Greenland is similar: the crust below it is being weighed down by the 3 million trillion litres of water held in the ice sheet, and if that ice sheet all melts then parts of the North American tectonic landmass will rise up. If the resulting increase in the height of the continent is bigger than the sea level rise, then major flooding may be avoided. Working out which scenario is more likely is vitally important for future generations, because one of these results will start to play out if global warming intensifies. What we know is this: the global mean sea level has risen 20cm since the beginning of the 20th century. Some of this has been owing to the water thermally expanding as the oceans have got hotter – since hotter liquids take up more volume (this is how liquid thermometers work). Some of the rise in sea level has been due to the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets melting, and some due to other glaciers melting. The rising sea levels are global: they affect everyone with a coastline, from tiny Pacific islands that would be entirely submerged to a huge country such as Bangladesh, for which a one-metre rise in sea levels would result in nearly a fifth of the country being submerged and 30 million people being displaced. But while rising sea levels affect everyone, the post-glacial rebound affects only the coasts connected to parts of the Earth’s crust weighed down by the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. It is hard to overestimate the importance of this issue, and we badly need more data and scientific understanding of these liquid processes. A limited number of specialised satellites, such as CryoSat, GRACE and ICESat-2 – just launched by Nasa – are being used to monitor ice thickness and to develop models of post-glacial rebound. What the science predicts is that if the ice melts first in the northern hemisphere, then Greenland may bounce up higher than the average sea level, as will parts of North America, and so sea levels there may initially go down. If the opposite happens, and the Antarctic ice melts before the Greenland ice sheet, then it is the southern tectonic plates that will bounce up first and the whole of North America’s eastern coast will go under water first. The big unknowns are how quick the ice will go in each location, and how fast the post-glacial rebound will be. We need to get a better understanding of these processes fast, because if we don’t it may be too late to avert catastrophe. These issues don’t dominate news agendas but they should. Recently the French environment minister resigned, citing the president’s lack of progress and urgency on climate change issues. In doing so, he voiced the concern of the whole scientific community about world leaders – we need a step change in governmental action. But there’s the rub: not all governments feel urgent about it. And why? Perhaps it’s because, as the issue of post-glacial rebound shows, there will be winners and losers from global warming. For instance, countries such as Russia will be less affected by sea level rises, and may benefit from a more temperate climate. In contrast, the US may not only suffer from new drought zones, but its low-lying eastern coast is threatened by the accelerating loss of Antarctic ice. As the 21st century continues and the ice continues to melt, it will become clearer which countries have a greater incentive to mitigate climate change, and the resulting geopolitics has the potential to drive division and conflict. • Mark Miodownik is the author of Liquid: The Delightful and Dangerous Substances That Flow Through Our Lives, which is short-listed for the Royal Society Book prize"
"Key dangers largely left out of the IPCC special report on 1.5C of warming are raising alarm among some scientists who fear we may have underestimated the impacts of humans on the Earth’s climate. The IPCC report sets out the world’s current knowledge of the impacts of 1.5C of warming and clearly shows the dangers of breaching such a limit. However, many scientists are increasingly worried about factors about which we know much less. These “known unknowns” of climate change are tipping points, or feedback mechanisms within the climate system – thresholds that, if passed, could send the Earth into a spiral of runaway climate change. Tipping points merit only a few mentions in the IPCC report. Durwood Zaelke, founder of the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development, said: “The IPCC report fails to focus on the weakest link in the climate chain: the self-reinforcing feedbacks which, if allowed to continue, will accelerate warming and risk cascading climate tipping points and runaway warming.” He pointed to water vapour in the air, which traps heat in the atmosphere, as well as the loss of polar ice, the collapse of permafrost, and the migration of tropical clouds towards the poles. Ice melting at the poles is known to be of particular danger. The Earth’s ice caps act as reflectors, sending some of the sun’s rays back into space and cooling the planet. When sea ice melts, it reveals dark water underneath, which absorbs more heat and in turn triggers greater warming, in a constant feedback loop. Ice on land, such as in Greenland and under much of the Antarctic, may contain yet another feedback loop; when the ice melts, water percolates to the land below where it lubricates the slide of ice over rock and could accelerate the collapse of glaciers into the surrounding sea. Bob Ward, of the Grantham Institute, said: “The IPCC summary for policymakers only mentions the west Antarctica and Greenland tipping points, which we may already have reached.” The full report of the IPCC reflects our lack of knowledge of the full potential of tipping points, he said: “The underlying report suggests that the other tipping points are too poorly understood, or not likely to be triggered until higher amounts of warming – but given their consequences, one would expect a more risk-based approach. That is, you don’t ignore them until you know them to be impossible.” A key finding of the new IPCC report is the dramatic difference that restricting warming to 1.5C above pre industrial levels would have on the global environment. The scientists found: • By 2100, global sea level rise would be 10cm lower with global warming of 1.5C compared with 2C. • Extreme heatwaves will be experienced by 14% of the world's population at least once every five years at 1.5C. But that figure rises to more than a third of the planet if temperatures rise to 2C • Arctic sea ice would remain during most summers if warming is kept to 1.5C. But at 2C, ice free summers are 10 times more likely, leading to greater habitat losses for polar bears, whales, seals and sea birds. • If warming is kept to 1.5C, coral reefs will still decline by 70-90% but if temperatures rise to 2C virtually all of the world's reefs would be lost One of the problems with tipping point thresholds is that we may not know when they are reached. Robert Larter, of the British Antarctic Survey, called polar ice sheets “sleeping giants”, which if they pass a tipping point will cause devastation. “As ice sheets melted after the last glacial period, there were times when sea level rose at a rate of more than three metres per century, an order of magnitude faster than the current rate,” he said. “This implies that there are situations in which ice sheets can melt much more rapidly than they have over the period we have been observing them. We should be very cautious about disturbing these sleeping giants.” Another issue with melting ice is that it uncovers and destabilises permafrost. This layer is known to contain vast quantities of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas with a warming effect many times that of carbon dioxide. Melting permafrost will release that gas into the atmosphere, with unpredictable consequences. Further unknowns include the effects of climate change on carbon sinks, such as soils and forests: higher temperatures could dry out some soils, causing them to release stored carbon into the air. But increased rainfall – a symptom of climate change in some regions – could in other areas be making it harder for forest soils to trap greenhouse gases such as methane. Mario Molina, who shared the Nobel prize in chemistry in 1995 for his work on depletion of the ozone layer, said: “The IPCC report demonstrates that it is still possible to keep the climate relatively safe, provided we muster an unprecedented level of cooperation, extraordinary speed and heroic scale of action. But even with its description of the increasing impacts that lie ahead, the IPCC understates a key risk: that self-reinforcing feedback loops could push the climate system into chaos before we have time to tame our energy system, and the other sources of climate pollution.”"
"We’re currently on pace to double the carbon dioxide-equivalent (including other greenhouse gases) in the atmosphere by around mid-century.  Since the late 1800s scientists have been trying to answer the question, how much global warming will that cause? In 1979, top climate scientists led by Jule Charney published a report estimating that if we double the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from pre-industrial levels of 280 ppm to 560 ppm, temperatures will warm by 3 ± 1.5°C.  Four decades later, ‘climate sensitivity’ estimates remain virtually unchanged, but some climate contrarians have argued that the number is at the low end of that range, around 2°C or less.  It’s an important question because if the contrarians are right, the 2°C resulting global warming would represent significantly less severe climate change consequences than if mainstream climate scientists are right and temperatures rise by 3°C.  It would also mean our remaining carbon budget for meeting the 2°C Paris target is about twice as large than if the mainstream consensus is right.  If the consensus is correct, we’re on pace to blow through the remaining Paris carbon budget by around 2030. Studies published in March 2014, May 2014, and December 2015 identified two critical flaws in the contrarians’ preferred so-called ‘energy balance model’ approach: it doesn’t account for the fact that Earth’s sensitivity can change over time, for example as large ice sheets continue to melt, or that the planet responds differently to different climate ‘forcings’. Last week, the journal Earth’s Future published a study by the University of Southampton’s Philip Goodwin that took both of these factors into account.  Goodwin ran climate model simulations treating every forcing separately, including changes in greenhouse gases, solar activity, particulates from volcanic eruptions, and from human fossil fuel combustion.  For each, he included feedbacks from changes in factors like atmospheric water vapor, clouds, snow, and sea ice, including how these factors change over different timescales, as Goodwin explained: I ran 10 million simulations with a relatively simple climate model. These 10 million simulations each used different climate feedback strengths, and so the way that climate sensitivity responded over time was different in each simulation.  To check which of the 10 million simulations were most realistic, I checked each simulation against observations of warming in the atmosphere and ocean up to the present day. I kept only the simulations that agreed with the observations for the real world.  This left 4600 simulations, where the values of the climate sensitivity (and changes in climate sensitivity over different timescales) agree with the atmosphere and ocean warming observed so far. It is from these final 4600 simulations that evaluate how the climate sensitivity evolves over time. Essentially, adding up all of the warming contributions from all of these factors at any given time tells us how sensitive the climate is on that timescale, whether it be a month, a year, a decade, or a century after atmospheric carbon dioxide levels have doubled.   Over the shortest timeframes of a year or less, Goodwin found that temperatures will rise by about 2°C once carbon dioxide levels have doubled, consistent with the conclusions of the contrarian studies.  That makes sense because those studies applied current climate measurements into energy balance models, but since carbon pollution is still rising, the climate still has a large energy imbalance.  Climate sensitivity, on the other hand, is usually evaluated at the point when the Earth reaches a new energy equilibrium, long after carbon dioxide levels have stopped rising. Once our carbon pollution levels decline close to zero (hopefully by mid-to-late century), the planet will start to reach that new equilibrium.  The slower feedbacks like melting ice will continue to kick in, and Goodwin found that on timescales close to a century thereafter, temperatures will rise by 1.9–4.6°C, most likely 2.9°C, consistent with mainstream climate science estimates since the 1979 Charney report. In other words, we are indeed on track to burn through the remaining Paris carbon budget by 2030, and under current international climate policies, we’re most likely headed for about 3.4°C warming by 2100.   Climate contrarians want to gamble on the long shot that the climate sensitivity is on the low end of the possible range, which would give us a few extra decades before we burn past the Paris target.  But even that relatively rosy scenario would require more aggressive international climate policies than are in place today.  We still have to change course even to limit ourselves to a doubling of carbon dioxide-equivalent in the atmosphere. And the body of scientific research keeps refuting the contrarian case.  If anything, recent research suggests the climate sensitivity is toward the high end of the possible range, but Goodwin’s study finds that it’s most likely right where climate scientists have expected for decades. As Goodwin concluded, some of the lowest estimates of climate sensitivity from before do not appear to hold on the long timescales"
