"A not-so-quiet repair revolution is taking place in communities across Britain. Consumers, fed up with having to throw away broken phones, toasters and other appliances, are instead meeting to learn how to repair them and to extend the lifetime of their products. These repair “pop-up parties”, where like-minded people can improve or learn new skills in a supportive environment, can prevent still-useful products from ending up in the bin, while saving money.  Advances in technology and new applications, combined with faster product obsolescence, means that electrical and electronic equipment make up one of the fastest growing waste streams in the world. The growing demand for these products is also driving unprecedented levels of resource extraction to keep up with increased rates of manufacturing of everyday goods – something that the planet can hardly support.   The number of electrical appliances and devices in UK households tripled between 1970 and 2002 and it continues to grow – the average household now owns around 41 electrical items. Many products develop simple faults which are challenging for the amateur to repair, resulting in replacement products being purchased and equipment with small faults being disposed of. For many consumers, repair is now only an option for high cost items such as cars and personal computers, or for household fixtures such as heating systems – washing machines, kettles and toasters are easier just to throw away. The ability to repair goods is key to maintaining the functionality of products and delaying, or avoiding, their disposal. The government recognises the value of repair as part of a waste reduction strategy, and the Welsh and Scottish governments have also signalled strong backing for practical action that encourages a circular economy. In Sweden, there are plans to reduce the VAT on repair work from 25% to 12%, and in France there are penalties for “planned obsolescence”, intentionally producing goods with short lives. Germany and Spain have also been looking at the issue.  Community-based organisations are providing innovative approaches to the repair of a variety of products including clothing and electrical equipment. Access to information, spare parts and tools is available on websites like iFixit, which publishes guides that teach people “how to fix almost anything” and invites users to create new ones. The London-based Restart Project is a community-based repair initiative that runs a forum for motivated individuals to attempt repairs that extend the working lifetime of a variety of items, concentrating primarily on electrical and electronic equipment, and promotes awareness of recycling routes for items they can’t fix.  Restart also arranges pop-up events, where members of the public can take along broken electrical items and attempt to repair them with some support. Restart do not charge a membership fee, and admission to the events they organise is also free. Their aim is simply to enable repair to help extend the lifetime of electrical and electronic equipment and reduce the number of these items that become waste. Restart’s volunteers act as “repair coaches”.   They are also social gatherings, so even if repairs are unsuccessful, participants are still happy to go along and have a go. Restart also acts as an education tool: through a variety of media channels they distribute information and raise awareness about the environmental impacts of end-of-life products and signpost those with unsuccessful repairs to recycling schemes. Some local authorities have also shown support for these initiatives.  Despite the good work being done, the repair network is complex and fragmented – there could be more of them, more widely located, and better known to consumers. Some consumers lack the skills, knowledge or confidence to attempt repairs, even when the resources are available. In a recent study conducted in partnership with The Restart Project, we asked participants at pop-up repair events about their previous experiences of repair. We also asked them about their recycling behaviours and their experiences at the pop-ups. Over half the participants had previously attempted to repair items on their own with different levels of success.  Confidence appears to play an important role in willingness to attempt repairs. It’s often easy to learn how to repair and purchase the tools and parts online, but the compact design of electricals and electronics often makes it an unforgiving task. Pop-up repair events offer a supportive environment in which you can receive help and support completing repairs, building your confidence.  Participants also described a lack of trust in commercial repair services with nearly half of the participants unable to name a repairer they trusted. Several mentioned that the perceived cost of a repair would discourage them from using local, paid-for repair services.  Informal community-based enterprises such as The Restart Project appear ideally placed to develop local networks and respond to the gap in trust. We also identified that participants were less likely to recycle their electrical items than other waste such as paper, glass and tins. This is a problem because electrical items contain materials which require large energy inputs to create and transport. Nevertheless, pop-up repair events may be able to encourage correct disposal of broken and unwanted household items by telling people how best to dispose of them.  Pop-up repair events, such as those organised by Restart, have the potential to reinvigorate our enthusiasm for repair."
"When asked to name one of the great wildlife habitats of the world it is unlikely that many people would choose a series of woods and bogs by the M3 in Surrey. But while herds of wildebeest might not sweep majestically through Camberley, the Thames Basin Heaths area does hold important numbers of birds such as woodlarks, Dartford warblers and nightjars, making it one of the most significant wildlife habitats in southern England. However, the local MP for Surrey Heath, Michael Gove, is apparently not too impressed. The former British justice secretary and leading Brexit campaigner sees withdrawal from the EU as an opportunity to get rid of the very legislation which protects these birds. For Gove, European environmental law “massively increases the cost and the regulatory burden for housing development”. The presence of these species in his constituency has led the heaths to be designated a “Special Protection Area” under the EU Birds Directive. Some parts of the heaths hold ecosystems which are deemed to be of such importance that they are classed as “Special Areas of Conservation” under the EU Habitats Directive.  These areas form part of Natura 2000, a network of protected sites covering 18% of the European Union. It is the largest coordinated network of its type in the world. Many of these areas are not nature reserves or national parks, but areas of land in private ownership, making them vulnerable to exploitation. European legislation recognises that wildlife is no respecter of national boundaries and that a community-wide effort is necessary to ensure the protection of vulnerable flora and fauna. The Habitats Directive obliges governments to preserve Natura 2000 sites. Under Article 6.3, any project or plan taking place in one of these sites must be assessed to ensure it does not adversely affect the integrity of the scheme. In the case of the Thames Basin Heaths this means that no property can be built within a 400m buffer zone of the special protection area, and all housing developments within 5km must include provision for a “suitable alternative natural green space” – an area of open ground which people can use for recreation. The aim is to prevent the heaths becoming overwhelmed with people and dogs, which is particularly important for species such as nightjars which nest on the ground and are vulnerable to disturbance. But Gove has sided with the property developers. For him, these regulations are too great a burden. Some of what he says is fair: there is undoubtedly a need for more housing in the area – and it is equally true that providing “alternative green space” requires thought and expenditure on the part of the developers, which may ultimately be passed on to the purchasers. There’s no escaping the fact that environmental law can create a tension between construction and conservation. However these EU directives exist to protect important areas from exactly these pressures. In many cases the legislation does not prevent development, but instead requires developers to think about how damage can be mitigated and, in some cases, habitat improved. The RSPB cites a number of benefits to this approach, including the proven economic and health benefits of having sites rich in wildlife close to home. Despite David Davis’ promise that environmental protections will remain in place when the UK leaves the EU, wildlife protection after Brexit faces an uncertain future. The Great Repeal Bill is intended to incorporate existing European legislation into UK law, giving parliament the power to “amend, repeal or improve” laws at a later date. However the environment secretary, Andrea Leadsom, has indicated that only about two-thirds of existing environmental law will be transposed into UK law, leaving groups such as the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust concerned about what will happen to the remainder.  The UK has a long history of proactive environmental legislation. Back in the 1950s, a backbench MP named Tufton Beamish introduced a private members bill which eventually passed into law as the Protection of Birds Act 1954. This was the forerunner of the Birds Directive and laid the foundations for the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, which became the key source of domestic legal protection for UK plants and animals. Speaking in the House of Lords in support of the bill, Beamish observed: Town and country, farmers and naturalists, we are all in it together. Provided there is unstinted cooperation between all ministers whose responsibilities touch on any aspect of this many-sided subject, there will be no problem in proving that good husbandry and higher material standards of living are consistent with careful protection of our wildlife and our countryside. As Britain leaves the EU, we must remember this ideal. If Andrea Leadsom really does want to ensure that we are “the first generation to leave our environment better than we found it” then we will need a robust legislative framework. Laws which ensure our ecosystems are protected and improved should be celebrated – not treated as burdensome red tape."
"The average global sea level has risen by more than 20cm since 1980 – that’s a rate of 0.5mm per month – according to new research from the Basque Centre for Climate Change (BCCC). These are frightening statistics for Europe’s vulnerable coastal cities including Barcelona, Istanbul, Dublin and others. With homes, infrastructure and indeed entire economies at stake, it’s crucial for authorities to understand the extent of the risk these cities are facing – and take steps to manage it.  To start with, it’s important to review such claims in detail, as predictions can vary greatly depending on such factors as the warming of the oceans and the melt rate of ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica. A closer inspection of the BCCC study shows that the authors misinterpreted the data, as the original source offers a much more conservative sea level rise of 20cm since 1880 – a rate of 1.5mm a year. This falls in the same ballpark as estimates by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and other recent research, making it a more credible figure.  Next, authorities need to understand the nature of the risk associated with sea level rise. While higher sea levels can mean that the ocean encroaches on developed coastal areas, this isn’t the only – or even the most serious – risk. Sea level rise is an important factor in climate change, which also heightens the risk from coastal storms and floods for European coastal cities.  Storminess and the intensity, or “magnitude”, of storms – rather than an increase in their frequency – is difficult to predict because of their natural variability. Predictions tend to rely on complex mathematical models for forecasting. In the UK, for example, scientists from the University of Reading and the Meteorological Office found an increase in the number of storms since 1910, in part due to climate change. But the array of models often show a range of results regarding frequency and magnitude from no change at all, to a more rapid increase throughout the 21st century. In fact, these storms could lead to greater coastal impact and erosion, as they cause a rapid rise in the average level of the sea, compared to that experienced because of long-term sea level rise.  Across Europe, cities, transport infrastructure and major industry are often located in the coastal zone. These coastal assets are vulnerable to the threat posed by sea level change and storminess. The extreme water level rise associated with storm surges is particularly worrying. A surge associated with a storm in 2005 added 1.5 metres to highest tide across northern Scotland and the Hebrides. And in 2013, a storm in southern England raised water levels at some locations by an additional 5-6 metres.  To protect Europe’s coastal cities from such disasters, the European Environment Agency suggests that authorities should find ways to improve resilience. This means finding ways to adapt to and lessen the impact of climate change, by investing in long-term, preventative measures.  This could mean anything from making improvements to urban planning with key consultation across a range of experts including climate scientists, coastal zone mangers and infrastructure managers, to increasing the number and size of green areas and limiting construction on floodplains.  Specifically, planners need to start moving away from hard engineering solutions such as sea walls and rock armour. Instead, they should consider working with natural processes to increase coastal resilience. For instance, many European coastal areas have extensive wetlands and beach systems, which can provide a natural “buffer” against the impact of sea level rise and intermittent storm surges.  Yet it can be difficult to persuade the inhabitants of coastal zones to have confidence in these “softer” solutions such as beach nourishment and wetland restoration. Education is key here, to explain how these measures can help. There’s still much progress to be made. Many cities are just beginning to develop and implement strategies to manage the impacts of climate change. These are long-term approaches, not short-term fixes, and as such, it will take time for authorities to gather the necessary political momentum and funds to invest toward mitigating coastal risks. A well-rounded approach which considers natural coastal processes, urban planning and economic vulnerability is crucial to building resilience, and protecting coastal cities from climate change."

Here’s what the temperature forecasting chart shows today:

The above chart based on the NCEP shows frosty days up ahead for the Arctic. Source: http://wxmaps.org
Ellesmere island, the 12th largest island in the world, will be about 5°C below normal over the coming week. A large part of the Arctic will be below freezing by early August, according to forecasts. This flies in the face of “accelerated warming” that is supposed to occur in the Arctic. Sea ice as a whole will come close to a modern low, but so has the temperature!
Steve Goddard at his website has written on multiple occasions about how it’s been the coldest summer in the Arctic on the (modern) record. Here’s the summer temperature chart for this year thus far:

Share this...FacebookTwitterSpiegel science journalist Axel Bojanowki comments here on the recently published paper by Kevin Cowtan and Robert Way, which suggests the Arctic has warmed more than first thought and that the so-called warming pause resulted from missing data.

Spiegel warns that eerily similar studies have been seen before, e.g. Steig et al, Mann et al.
Bojanowski reminds readers that “the calculation method is in dispute” and writes that reaction from the scientific community has been split, with the warmists uncritically welcoming it with glee, and skeptics being suspicious of the study’s methodology, “underscoring the weaknesses of the new analysis“. The overall tone of Bojanowski’s article is one of skepticism, reminding readers that such studies from “newcomer scientists” have been seen before.
Bojanowski explains how the study’s authors filled in the regions of missing temperature data in the Arctic, and that other scientists are skeptical of the method used, citing Judith Curry’s blog commentary. Spiegel writes:
Among other factors, Curry points out that measurement stations in the Arctic are primarily land-based, but that the now calculated region of the Arctic data void is covered mostly by sea ice and or water.”

The Spiegel science author then warns readers that we’ve seen this kind of statistical work in other studies and that there’s a “feeling of foreboding” surrounding the overall results. He writes:
Caution is advised – as other studies from the other side of the planet have shown. Since 2007 several prominently published calculations have shown that Antarctica as a whole would warm- much to the surprise of many experts because the southern continent is considered a climatological single, isolated case. The latest UN climate report determined there is minimal confidence in the concerned temperature calculations.”
Bojanowski writes that the study is “somewhat particular” because both authors are newcomers: “Cowtan researches in crystallography, Way is a student in geography; both also write for an internet site that would like to run down climate skeptics. The constellation does bring a feeling of foreboding.”
Bojanowski then reminds readers of another similar case: citing Michael Mann and his hockey stick chart, which was debunked by “outsiders” Ross McKitrick and Steve McIntyre. He also links to the Steig’s paper.
The difference, Bojanowski writes, is that Cowtan and Way are “open for a lively discussion” and that both don’t claim that their study is the final truth.

"The seasonal sea-ice retreat across the Arctic Ocean is perhaps one of the most conspicuous indicators of climate change. In September 2012, a new record was set for the time that we have been tracking sea ice with satellites: the minimum sea ice extent was some 50% below the climatic average for that month. Four years on, and the September 2016 record tied with 2007 for the second lowest sea ice extent since measurements began in 1978. The seasonal retreat of sea ice is largely because the atmosphere in the Arctic is heated under 24 hours of daylight in the summer, and this makes the ice melt. In the cold of the perpetual darkness of winter, the sea ice extent returns to its winter norm: the only heat available to slow sea ice growth is from winds and ocean currents moving warm air and water in from the south.  However, during the winter of 2016/17 the sea ice did not return to its winter norm. In fact, the sea ice extent was the lowest ever recorded for this time of year. Though the Arctic is not exactly in the UK’s backyard, the changes in sea ice coverage are thought to be at least partly responsible for the recent run of severe weather events experienced across the northern hemisphere. These include unusually cold winter weather across parts of Europe and the US, and deadly smogs in parts of China. The Arctic is warming about twice as fast as the rest of the world. As the difference between atmospheric temperatures in the Arctic and mid-latitudes (which includes the UK, part of North America, and a band of northern Europe and Asia) decreases, the speed at which weather systems (depressions) track across the Atlantic to northwestern Europe is reduced. This means that snow and rain can persist for longer, and high pressure systems are “harder to shift”, which can lead to further reductions in air quality. The largest oceanic heat input to the Arctic comes from water that has been in the Atlantic Ocean, and has travelled through the Fram Strait and around Svalbard. This “Atlantic water” circulates around the Arctic in an anti-clockwise direction. This water is currently the warmest it has been for 2,000 years and now contains enough heat to completely melt the sea ice within a couple of years.  However, while this water is warmer than the ambient Arctic water, it is also saltier, and so heavier, too. It sits at depths of 100 to 400 metres across much of the Arctic Ocean. This means that the Atlantic water heat is insulated from the surface by a layer of lighter, colder and fresher Arctic Ocean water which sits above it. Atlantic water contact with the sea surface – which then melts the sea ice impacting coverage and thickness – has previously been restricted to the region around Svalbard, where the Atlantic water enters the Arctic Ocean. However, new measurements reported by a team of international scientists have shown, for the first time, that previously insulated Atlantic water heat is now being stirred up to the sea surface. This results in enhanced sea ice melt, much further to the east, north of Siberia.     We previously measured the upward Atlantic water heat flux in this region in 2007 and 2008. At the time it was very modest. However, the new measurements estimate this flux to have increased by two to four times over the winters of 2013/14 and 2014/15. The result of this increase is that sea ice thickness has been reduced by between 18 and 40cm. This exceeds the impact of the atmospheric heat on sea ice melt alone (estimated to be 18cm).  The researchers attribute the change to a reduction in the vertical density gradient within the overlying Arctic water layer. The Atlantic water has moved closer to the sea surface, and created conditions much more like those found around Svalbard, where there is less sea ice. Lead researcher Igor Polyakov describes the change as the “atlantificiation” of this part of the Arctic Ocean. These important new results highlight the increasing role of heat coming from the Atlantic Ocean in driving sea ice retreat in the Arctic Ocean. They are a profound sign of the planet’s changing climate, and show that there is a link between retreating Arctic sea ice and the severe weather that has been witnessed in mid-latitude countries. Furthermore, they show that the impact of Atlantic water heat on sea ice is highly variable across the Arctic Ocean, with significant heat fluxes restricted to geographic “hot spots”. The identification of these hot spots will be key to improving how we forecast the weather in the northern hemisphere and understand how the retreat of Arctic sea ice impacts on it."

Share this...FacebookTwitterAnd DEATH by heat by 2100 if we don’t stop burning carbon now.
The ultra-alarmist Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) forecasts that the number of heat-wave days will double in just seven years, so reports CO2 Handel website here. The forecast appeared in Nature.
Recall that the PIK is the outlier panicky institute that insists sea levels may rise 2 meters by the year 2100 and believe that the planet is warming faster than ever, even though global temperatures have dropped slightly over the last decade. Its director is Professor Dr. Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber, the chairman of the WBGU, a 12-man advisory committee of “renown scientists” who are calling for the rapid transformation of the global economy to one that is driven mostly by renewable energies. The WBGU also calls for a watering down of democracy, insisting that professors in academia must have the say on how the planet is governed.
Back to the subject of heat waves, the German Press Agency DPA writes:
Strong heat waves for this time of the year will double by 2020, calculates a team led by 2020 Dim Coumou of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (Pik). By 2040 such weather patterns will even quadruple. Droughts, heat waves, and storms could in turn enhance climate change in the future, the scientists add in the journal Nature.”
The scientists also add that “soil and plants absorbed up to 30 percent of the man-made carbon dioxide over the past 50 years and thus have slowed climate change.” But they say forests are no longer absorbing the CO2 as well, and so the climate is going to get a lot worse.
“Robust” fortune-telling

Based on models – that’s the good news because so far every PIK model projection has been completely wrong. The opposite of what they projected is actually happening in reality. No temperature increase in 15 years.
The PIK fortune-telling doesn’t stop at the year 2040; it even looks at the year 2100. Now that must be some really powerful fortune-telling. For you non-believers and skeptics, think again:
‘The Pik study delivers more robust results than of the earlier studies,’ comments Stefan Hagemann of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg on inquiry. ‘What today is the exception, is what we will have to get used to in the future.'”
Dim Coucou claims that things are going to get a heck of a lot worse:
While today only 5% of the globe’s land surface sees heat extremes in the summer each month, that will go up to 85 percent. ‘In many regions the coldest summer months will become hotter than the hottest months today,’ Coumou says.”
Overall the German angst-spreading PIK scientists say it’s too late to prevent the massive heat waves foreseen for 2020 or 2040 – there’s just too much CO2 in the atmosphere. But if we act now and change our carbonic ways, then there’s still hope to avert the catastrophe that awaits our grandchildren in the year 2100, Coucou wants us to believe.

"The Daily Mail calls it a “slime wave”. The Sun calls them “an army”. Either way, both papers have reported 500 billion slugs are set to invade British gardens, after a mild winter created perfect breeding conditions.  So is the UK really about to be overwhelmed by slimy slugs? The simple answer is no, but there could be something far worse in store. Headline numbers alone aren’t necessarily something to get in a lather over. A typical garden can contain several thousand slugs, and the “500 billion” figure is derived from estimates of maximum numbers per area. In any case, slug numbers can rise and fall a great deal across time and space, in natural cycles, and even astonishingly dramatic increases are not always cause for concern. Like waves crashing against a beach, the rise is often transient and local – usually slug numbers will drop back to normal, with the disturbance hardly noticed beyond a few local gardeners.  What is more problematic is the progressive, sustained and perhaps less spectacular rise in numbers which, tsunami-like, is maintained for far longer, and spreads widely throughout the countryside. This is Britain’s real slug invasion. So what can we do about it? The trigger seems innocuous enough in isolation: a few non-native slugs from continental Europe have accidentally been introduced. Several of these species have close relatives in the UK, so similar in fact that only specialists can tell them apart, and they can interbreed freely. Of course, many animals can create hybrids without presenting a threat, but what makes slugs different – and these hybrids so worrying – is their interesting and deviant sex lives. Slugs are hermaphrodites, which means the same individual exists as both sexes; they first develop as males, before experiencing a true hermaphrodite phase to become female. This means they can dispense with normal mating requirements, and this is where the consequences of “La difference” between British and continental species becomes significant. When slugs colonised the UK after the last ice age, they found an island recently covered with ice sheets, where the biological diversity remained poorer than continental Europe. In these circumstances, the ability to self-fertilise was a good evolutionary strategy, one which ensured reproduction even when slug populations were devasated by harsh weather.  A downside of such continued close inbreeding (and mating with oneself is as inbred as it gets) is a rapid loss of genetic variability, and some British slug species eventually came to consist of almost genetically identical individuals. This meant they were more vulnerable to parasites and pathogens that could rapidly evolve to overcome their defences. Meanwhile, in continental Europe, slugs were becoming more diverse, as balmier weather meant parasites and pathogens were a bigger issue than finding a mate. These slugs tended not to self-fertilise, and were genetically highly variable. This made at least some of them more resilient to attacks from parasites – a possibility not afforded to the inbred British slugs. Echoes of these different past environments resonate in contemporary species. British slugs, adapted to a variable climate and dearth of mates, have fallen into the clichéd “No sex please, we’re British” mould, producing fewer, bigger eggs later in life by self-fertilisation. Continental slugs, meanwhile, adapted to resist rapidly evolving enemies. Their strategy is therefore to produce many smaller eggs earlier in life, which maximises genetic diversity and compensates for losing many individuals to infection. These different adaptations weren’t an issue until humans disturbed the natural order by moving slugs back and forth as stowaways in commercial produce. As a result of this, we’ve seen widespread breeding between British and continental species. These new hybrid “super-slugs” are highly fertile, and their genetically diverse offspring are adapted to cope with both the British climate and parasites and pathogens, most of which remain in continental Europe anyway. Legislation aimed at environmental protection has led to the EU banning commercial use of molluscicides (pelleted chemicals which poison slugs but cause collateral damage to other wildlife). Instead, the emphasis is on using natural enemies like nematode worms, though these are generally ineffective against the larger invasive hybrids. Nonetheless, the increased slug biomass could still host important veterinary or agricultural parasites and pathogens, spreading more plant and animal diseases. Remarkably, despite their obvious presence in our gardens, we remain startlingly ignorant of the fundamental biology of slugs; evidenced by recent work which increased the number of identified British species by more than a fifth. So where are we going with this phenomenon? Studies have already found invasive slugs and snails can destabilise ecosystems and reduce biodiversity in the US and Scandinavia. Something similar is happening here in the UK. The good news is that our research suggests population sizes do eventually begin to decline, after 30 to 40 years. The ecosystem may eventually rebound from this slug invasion, but it remains to be seen how long it will take and what the lasting effects will be for the spread of diseases, ecosystem services, or British biodiversity."

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s online Bild newspaper here quotes German meteorologist Dominik Jung: “For the coming winter give a probability of 70:30% that it’s going to be a colder-than-normal winter.”

Jung is not the only meteorologist forecasting a colder-than-normal winter. Bild also reports that also Michael Klein of Donnerwetter.de expects better than even chances of bitter cold months: “The first trend points more to a colder-than-normal winter. At least it is not going to be mild.“
The southern Germany’s online Wasserburger Stimme reports here that the chances of an “extreme winter” are as high as ever this year. The site also quotes German meteorologist Dominik Jung, who says that winters in Central Europe in general began to become milder after the 1960s thanks to mild winds coming in off the Atlantic. Jung adds that the highpoint was reached in the 1990s. But: “In the last 5 years the winters have been normal or slightly colder than normal. The series of extremely mild winters appears to be over.”
A meteorologist who believes anything?
Jung feels that this winter could be a really harsh one – the sort not seen in 50 years. But cautions that such a forecast cannot be made with high certainty. Jung adds:
But the probability of a new XXL winter has increased considerably. New theories claim that extended ice melt at the North Pole could lead to significantly colder winters in Europe. It is not that the climate over the whole world will warm up. There are regions that will indeed get warmer, and there are also regions that will get cooler.”
Here Jung is subscribing to the after-the-fact nonsensical theory that the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) desperately had to cook after being caught off guard by cold winters that took Europe by surprise. It’s a dubious theory based solely on IPCC-quality models with no data to support it.
Jung adds that the US NCEP models are also forecasting a slightly colder normal winter than usual (1961-1990 mean).
UK meteorologist predicts possibly “the worst for decades”
Forecasts of a harsh winter are also circulating in Britain. The online Express here bears the title: Worst winter for decades: Record-breaking snow predicted for November.” It writes:
Long-range forecasters blamed the position of a fast-flowing band of air known as the jet stream near Britain and high pressure for the extreme conditions. Jonathan Powell, forecaster for Vantage Weather Services, said: ‘We are looking at a potentially paralysing winter, the worst for decades, which could at times grind the nation to a halt.'”

It’s hard to tell how much all of this is headline-grabbing. Some meteorologists may be getting carried away. My WAG is a more or less normal winter.
Greenpeace Arctic Activists Update
Complaints that the cell is too cold
The UK leftist Independent here writes that some of the 30 arrested Greenpeace activists are complaining of harsh conditions and that their cells are too cold. The Independent quotes the father of a detained activist:
‘There’s no regular access to such simple things as clean water, regular meals and a warm enough air temperature,’ Mr Golubok said.”
What do the activist expect from a Russian prison? Five-star resort accommodations, massages and a sauna?
Captain says he needs to go home because of heart problems
Meanwhile the English language Ria Novosti reports that the captain of the Arctic Sunrise ship Peter Wilcox now regrets going to the Arctic to protest:
RIA Novosti’s legal reporting agency RAPSI quoted Willcox as saying he had never faced such severe charges in 40 years of activism, and that he would have stayed in New York if he could choose to go back. […] Denial of Willcox’s appeal came despite his lawyer expressing concern over his health complications stemming from a heart condition.”
Oh, now suddenly he has heart problems. Strange how just a month ago his heart had been in good enough shape to allow him to venture off into the harsh Arctic conditions for a little protest and boat ramming.
Lavrov warns external parties “not to interfere”
Yesterday Ria Novosti here wrote that Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov reiterated that the environmental activists “clearly violated the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea” and that “the issue should be left in the hands of the courts“. He also warned external parties “not to interfere“.
Ria Novosti writes that “All 30 have appealed their detention, seeking release on bail or home arrest. The Murmansk Regional Court has rejected all 11 appeals it has heard so far, ordering the activists to remain behind bars until a hearing on November 24.”
Looks to me like none are going to be released on bail. There’s just too much material to sort through and no one wants to decide prematurely. Besides, the Russians have lots of time and there’s no hurry.

"Donald Trump wants to restrict or even abolish the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In particular, he is proposing to dramatically limit the federal agency’s power to regulate carbon dioxide emissions, instead putting the onus on individual states to self-regulate.  Although it sounds like a dire strategy, and emissions will probably increase, tougher regulations in blue states like California or New York should mitigate the inevitable oil and gas boom in Texas and the Midwest.  Far more worrying than a scale back of the EPA are existing policies, which already subsidise fossil fuels to an alarming extent. US markets are currently so distorted in favour of the most polluting energy sources that scrapping climate regulations will do relatively little to increase emissions, compared to the damage that is already being done. Trump’s anti-EPA proposals – if they are ever implemented – will be comparable to throwing a match on a burning building. Coal, oil, and natural gas – fossil fuels – are the key cause of climate change, yet they receive huge support from governments. I’ve developed a new method to extract the size of fossil-fuel subsidies by looking at how much these fuels are used by individual countries. By comparing actual energy use to a hypothetical amount a country “should” use in the absence of subsidies, we can extract the value of a country’s implicit subsidies. These benefits go far beyond the obvious tax breaks for coal, oil and gas firms. We are dealing here with entire economies set up to favour fossil fuel consumption over more energy-efficient or renewable alternatives. This manifests itself in a wide variety of “hidden subsidies”, ranging from cheaper loans for drilling companies to subsidised mortgages which push people to build bigger houses that use more energy.  One striking example is the exemption of roadways from property tax. In the US, almost all land pays some type of property tax – even federal forests pay states for tying up land in a particular use. The land on which roads are built, however, generally pays nothing. This results in lost revenues and encourages more driving, and more petrol burning. Add up the value of all these benefits and what do we get? In 2010, the most recent year in my analysis, fossil fuel subsidies in the US were worth a staggering US$170 billion. That amounted to 1.8% of GDP or US$1,400 per year for the average American family.  These subsidies have been rising since 1980, the earliest year I analysed, even as people became more aware of global warming. Ironically, there was an especially sharp rise just after America signed the Kyoto protocol in 1997 – an international treaty aimed at restricting carbon emissions. While probably unrelated, this nonetheless highlights that what governments say and do are two entirely different and often opposing things.  These subsidies are already contributing to higher emissions to a far greater extent than any potential EPA deregulation. Both directly and indirectly the government offers incentives to individuals and firms to use more energy and to burn more fossil fuels than they otherwise would.  Getting rid of these policies would improve efficiency and provide a reprieve to strained government budgets, while also lowering carbon emissions. My research shows that had the US eliminated all subsidies between 1980 and 2010, its emissions would have been 11% lower than they actually were. In fact, almost the entire increase in US carbon emissions over that period came from rising fossil-fuel subsidies which encouraged more energy use. Trump’s suggestion that he may seek to eliminate the EPA and its various regulations on vehicle or factory pollution would work like yet another subsidy. However, the effects pale in comparison to the damage already done and continuing to be done by existing subsidy programs implemented over the past 20 years under presidents Clinton, Bush and Obama."
"Residents of Penzance, Cornwall, the UK’s first “plastic-free” town, were understandably piqued this week to find that 150 Christmas trees had been put up – every single one made of plastic. Local business chiefs behind the move defended their decision to opt for fake trees for the community and insisted they were more sustainable than the fresh alternative – which would later have to be burned – and could be dusted off and reused for many years.  Artificial trees used to be a manky wire frame with a bit of tinsel attached, typically left forgotten in the loft along with their tangled Christmas lights. But modern-day tree technology has leapt forward and uses injection moulding to create realistic sprigs. Even close up, the pricier artificial ones can fool most consumers into thinking they are real. But looks are not everything. With major retailers such as John Lewis reporting that “faux” or artificial trees typically made from plastic are now outselling traditional fresh trees, are the ersatz ones an environmental nightmare? According to the Carbon Trust, it is the manufacture of the plastic, from oil, that creates most – around two-thirds – of their carbon emissions. A further quarter is created by the industrial emissions produced when the tree itself is made. Their carbon footprint is boosted by the trees typically being shipped by container from China before arriving in the shops. Friends of the Earth is advising consumers who have fake trees to keep using them for as long as possible (and today’s versions will last for years) but to look into more environmentally friendly options when it comes to a replacement. Its tree campaigner Emi Murphy says: “Buying a potted tree with roots lets you grow it outside and use it again year after year, reducing its environmental impact and costing you less. A living tree will carry on absorbing carbon from the atmosphere for years to come. The other option to check out is the tree-rental service offered by many garden centres and plant nurseries.” Alternatively, string some fairy lights over a houseplant you already have. Meanwhile, Penzance could take inspiration from London’s fashion district Carnaby Street, which is promising a “world-first” sustainable ocean-style Christmas installation to be unveiled next week. Every element will use recycled and reusable materials. These include repurposed fishing netting to look like green kelp, more than 500m of post-use bubble wrap standing in for coral and more than 1,500 recycled plastic bottles for fish and bubbles. The finishing touches have been added in with over 100 litres of water-based eco-friendly, vegan paint. Eat your heart out, David Attenborough."

Share this...FacebookTwitterRemember Paul Ehrlich’s prophesy of doom and gloom back in 1970 when he predicted rising global population (then 4 billion) would lead to mass global starvation already by the 1980s. Today more than 40 years later the planet has a population of over 7 billion and experts are warning of another global menace: obesity.

Ehrlich’s prophesy was pure rubbish.
At the Achse des Guten website here Benny Peiser brings our attention to a short report in the German media. The report is good news and is of global significance, and so you’d think it would be worthy of front page news. Not so with today’s cynical, catastrophe-obsessed media. The best they could do was write an obscure itty-bitty blurb and bury it deep in their website pages. The public doesn’t need to know about this.
The online German RP writes:
According estimates of the UN Agricultural Organization, the global grain production will reach a record high with 2.5 billion tonnes. That means an increase of 7% over a year earlier. Wheat production will increase by almost 7% to a high of 700 million tonnes. Therefore it will be able to more than offset the drop of last year.”
Rice production also has not withered away, rising 2%, the RP writes.
So what about all the bad climate change that was supposed to have a massively negative impact on crops? All silly Ehrlich-type scare stories as usual. Agricultural output continues its overall climb. There’s even food to burn in millions of cars.

"George Monbiot, columnist and author of several books on the climate crisis Before I worked for the Guardian, I tried writing for other newspapers, in the belief I should reach the unconverted. But I gradually discovered that all of them were intensely hostile to thoughtful explorations of ecological and climate breakdown. In total, I was commissioned to write 26 articles. All but two were spiked. Eventually I realised it was impossible to cover these crucial issues properly without supportive editors. Reluctantly at first, I started writing for the Guardian in the early 1990s. Across most of this period, it has been the only paper that has consistently supported powerful writing about the gathering collapse of our life support systems. Now, with your help, it is devoting unprecedented resources to the greatest predicament humankind has ever faced. Thanks to your support, I will keep writing about every aspect of our environmental crisis, always striving to dig deeper and to understand more.  Emily Holden, environment reporter for Guardian USAs the Guardian’s environment and climate crisis reporter in Washington DC, I write about how the Trump administration’s rollbacks of key public health and pollution protections will hurt Americans. I investigate how corporate power over public policy stalls climate progress at the national and state level. I have reported on environment policy across the country, tracking the build-out of the plastics industry in Appalachia and local resistance to chemicals manufacturing in Louisiana. For our Toxic America series, I tested my own body to demonstrate how many dangerous chemicals Americans are exposed to in daily life. As a million species face extinction, I have traveled from the west coast to the Gulf of Mexico to chronicle the devastating toll human living takes on nature and to explain what Trump officials’ work to ease wildlife protections will mean for biodiversity.  Oliver Milman, environment reporter for Guardian US The media traditionally overlooks slow-moving emergencies so it’s inspiring that the Guardian has long covered the climate crisis in a thoughtful, comprehensive and, increasingly, an urgent way. That urgency is now playing out in real time, in a tumult of hurricanes, wildfires, heatwaves and protester rage. The US is a crucible for the decisions that led to the climate crisis as well as the disasters wrought by it, demanding that we not only report on the victims – disproportionately people of colour and the disadvantaged – of this unfolding catastrophe but also interrogate the policies that have led us to this point. I have sought to illuminate the actions of the Trump administration, easily the most destructive when it comes to climate than any previous US administration, and show how the climate crisis is playing out as an existential threat for many Americans on the margins. I’m currently looking at how global heating will shape the 2020 election, as well as some of the emerging solutions to the crisis. This is the defining issue of our time and we need to treat it as such. Matthew Taylor, environment correspondent We have just finished the Polluters project, which aimed to shine a light on the role of fossil fuel companies in the escalating climate crisis – and the financial, lobbying and political systems that underpin them. It was a huge collective effort with reporters, data journalists and editors working in countries around the world for the past six months. I teamed up with academics in the US to pull together data that revealed that just 20 fossil fuel companies are behind a third of global carbon emissions. I have also been investigating the plastics industry, uncovering how global fossil fuel corporations are investing $180bn in new plastic production companies, even as scientists discover plastic pollution in every aspect of our lives from the oceans to drinking water, food to the air we breathe – with unknown health implications. Another area of inquiry is air pollution and its impact on people’s day-to-day lives, particularly in big cities where cars dominate the public space. It was, in part, a realisation that the same fossil fuel companies were at the heart of each of these three major ecological crises – plastics, air pollution and global heating – that led to focus on the systemic nature of the crisis and the Polluters project. I have also been following the emergence of various environmental protest movements over the past 18 months – particularly Extinction Rebellion and the school strikes. I first heard about plans for XR in a central London cafe six months before it launched. One of the founders told me they would bring large parts of central London to a standstill for days on end with hundreds of people arrested for peaceful mass civil disobedience. Eighteen months later that has proved remarkably prescient, although what happens next is unclear. But when I saw some of those involved in the latest XR protests holding up copies of our Polluters project front page, it reminded me that the Guardian’s journalism can help shape and inform the debate around these huge crises we face. Adam Morton, environment editor, Guardian Australia Eastern Australia continues to suffer through the worse drought in living memory. Summer is weeks away, but parts of the country are sweltering and burning. Its most celebrated natural wonder is under grave threat. Scientists warn a local extinction crisis is worsening. Australians are increasingly concerned, yet politics continues to wreck itself over global heating, fights between and within parties over climate policy having played a part in the downfall of the previous five prime ministers. The government repeatedly claims to be acting, but has few policies, national emissions are rising year-on-year, vast new fossil fuel projects win support and leaders from the Pacific islands and elsewhere are dismissed when they call for more to be done. Exploring the changes being felt across the country and holding Australia’s political and business leaders to account are the major focus for Guardian Australia’s environment reporting team, which – with readers’ support – recently expanded from one to three, with an increased emphasis on investigations. We are also committed to telling the stories of people living on the frontline of climate change and spotlighting tales of hope: showing that, in a wealthy country with unmatched renewable resources, there are options beyond despair. Jillian Ambrose, energy correspondent It has taken only a few decades for the energy industry to power the world into a climate catastrophe. The Guardian’s Polluters series laid this bare: oil companies have understood the consequences of their actions decades ahead of the public, and they have actively fought to conceal the truth about the world’s fossil fuel addiction. This truth is now propelled by social media, and gaining ground in US court hearings and in climate talks across the globe. #TheyKnew. But the Polluters series also revealed that for Big Oil the destruction of the climate is still business as usual. By 2030 the world’s biggest oil producers plan to produce an extra 7m barrels of oil and gas everyday; knowingly putting the world on track for climbing global temperatures and deadly climate chaos. At the same time, UK government officials are using taxpayer money to finance fossil fuels abroad, locking developing countries into decades more of dependence on a dying industry. And the global investment industry stands poised to use people’s pensions pots to buy a stake in Saudi Aramco, easily the world’s biggest polluter. The energy industry, and its backers, must be held to account on its greenwashed PR promises and spin; where journalists shine a light, progressive leaders can take action to dismantle the structures that reward pollution with profits – and build something new.Patrick Barkham, natural history writer I can’t pretend that revealing how the long-tailed blue butterfly has bred rather well along England’s south coast this year is the world’s most important story. Writing about other species, and our relationships with them, can seem an insignificant dot among all the vital news reported by the Guardian. But we – both readers and writers – are joining the dots. The struggles and successes of other species in an age of extinction prick our conscience, tell us about the climate crisis and will ultimately determine whether our civilisation can endure. I’ve recently written about Sir David Attenborough’s career and ancient trees threatened by high-speed rail; I’m researching stories about regenerative farming and rewilding. We need to know what’s happening to plants and animals but we also need hope, and that’s provided by shining a light on solutions – the many human action that address our current predicament. Jon Watts, global environment editor Our natural life support systems are collapsing. That is a sentence nobody in their right mind would ever want to dwell on, but in different ways on different days, that’s what I spend most of my working life thinking and writing about. Fortunately for my mental health, I also get to talk to the brave and brilliant people who are fighting to change that. This year, I have reported on the environmental crisis from the Arctic to the Amazon, interviewed Greta Thunberg, covered climate protests across the world, collaborated on the Green Blood investigation into international mining crimes, and helped to pull together the Polluters series of stories that named and shamed the fossil fuel companies profiting from climate breakdown. In the coming two months, I will join a search for nature-based political solutions in Brazil and UN negotiations in Chile that aim to raise action on carbon emissions. Next year, there will be even more important climate and biodiversity summits in Glasgow and Kunming, as well as environmentally crucial elections in the US and elsewhere. This feels like a defining moment for humanity: Excited the issues are finally getting the attention they deserve. Worried the urgency is still not at the level required. Proud the Guardian and its supporters are taking the lead in stepping up the pace. Fiona Harvey, environment journalist If the climate crisis were the only environmental emergency facing us, we might be in with a good chance of solving it. But at the same time as moving to a low-carbon world, we have to grapple with pressing issues from the plastic scourge of the oceans to the pollution we are pouring into our children’s lungs, our failing water supplies, rapidly falling populations of vital fauna, our plundering of the oceans sending fish populations plummeting, and the challenge of feeding more than 9 billion people. We do not have the luxury of choosing which of these to concentrate on: they are all vital to our continued life on the planet, and that is why the Guardian devotes more reporting effort to these issues than any of the world’s other major media. These problems can all be solved and – contrary to alarmist claims from the extreme left and right – they can be solved without plunging us into a new dark age or reversing the benefits of modern life. Done right, we can improve life for all and create a happier and more equitable world as well as a healthier planet. Ignoring our pressing environmental problems solves nothing, and writing about them is the first step. The message is one of hope – but hope only works if we acknowledge and act on the need for change. Nina Lakhani, environmental justice reporter, Guardian US Environmental justice means equal access to clean air, land and water, and healthy food wherever we work, live, play, learn and pray – regardless of wealth, ethnicity, skin colour, gender, age and social class. In other words, we should all get to breath clean air, have enough water to drink, and be able to buy or grow healthy food. But the reality is that ecological hazards and climate disasters have the harshest impacts on people of colour, indigenous communities and those on low incomes. This isn’t new, but rising sea levels and extreme weather events linked to the climate crisis, coupled with the roll back of environmental protection and climate resilience programmes by the Trump administration, means vulnerable communities face mounting threats. That’s why in my role as the Guardian’s first environmental justice reporter, I’ll be investigating the impact of classist and racist public policies, corporate interests and the climate crisis on communities across the US and beyond. Who breaths the most polluted air? Which communities struggle to access enough water? Where are the food deserts? Who are the environmental justice warriors fighting back against Big Business and state corruption? Which children have access to safe green spaces and which don’t? Environmental racism and discrimination cause and perpetuate health, social and economic inequalities. Help the Guardian expose the shocking, and champion the extraordinary through our year-long series Our Unequal Earth. Damien Gayle, reporter Without the logistical, editorial and financial support of the Guardian, I could not have spent two weeks carrying out thorough on-the-ground reporting of Extinction Rebellion’s “autumn uprising” protests in London this October. In-depth reporting is only possible with a newsroom able to give reporters the time they need to walk the streets and meet people face to face, a newsroom that isn’t commissioning us to hammer out six stories a day for the commercial team to throw adverts on to. And without billionaire backers, that kind of news organisation relies on the support of ordinary people like you. Continue to support us, and we can continue to cover the news and issues that you care about. Damian Carrington, environment editor The climate crisis and annihilation of wildlife around the world is finally breaking into the mainstream, as the impacts become obvious and the youth strikers call older generations to account. So I’m focusing on both the increasing dangers of climate breakdown and the solutions, including those that involve restoring nature and, with it, wildlife. The next year is critical, with key UN summits on climate and biodiversity. Human civilisation evolved in a period of settled climate conditions – its continuation requires stopping our own actions bringing that period to a chaotic end."
"As a way to step up her commitment to the global fight against climate inaction, Jane Fonda has decided to start getting arrested – on what seems to be weekly basis. It’s a curious sentiment for her to feel like she should be doing more, considering her activist history eclipses pretty much the entirety of Hollywood’s, but it’s a genuinely heart-warming notion from our pinko grandmother. (Those pics of her picketing with Arundhati Roy and Naomi Klein? You really love to see it.) In recent photos, she is seen dressed immaculately in a Chanel coat, smiling while police take her away, raising her closed fists as high as she can, given the restraints binding them together.  The reaction, interestingly, has been mixed. Young people (ie those who haven’t grown up with an especially firm knowledge of now-aged Hollywood divas– I can’t relate) have taken to Twitter to critique the action. It’s performative, they write from the safety of their Brooklyn apartments – it’s problematic, it’s an irresponsible show of privilege as an older rich white woman … as if her privilege, and manoeuvring of it, isn’t the point. It’s quite the ouroboros – a tweet calling someone else performative can end up being performative in itself, but it’s par for the course with online discourse these days. It’s also a peculiar misreading of the optics behind Jane’s actions. At her age, garnering media attention and using the tools of recognisability is an effective way of connecting to her much older audience. It’s one that isn’t particularly known for positive contributions to environmental sustainability conversations, and one that might be uninterested in hearing from younger activists on the topic. It’s a shame that’s the case, but integrating older figures into our battles is nothing more than a smart tactical move. It’s time to start getting intergenerational instead of fixating solely on a single voice. Imagine being 81 years old and facing ostracisation and constant threats by multiple US governments and a powerful contingent of rightwingers, only for young leftwing people to call your activism superficial, and you might have some kind of understanding of how bad faith these criticisms sound. There are, of course, hundreds of celebrities who have tapped into the zeitgeist and the metrics of “wokeness” to appeal to new markets without doing anything significant to, say, change that market, or enact any kind of significant difference or shift in consciousness, so the suspicion is perhaps understandable. It’s nonetheless important for us to parse why legitimate actions are scorned, so that we may be more critical of the powerful, and less susceptible to the ever growing manipulations of modern day PR. The signifiers of wokeness – beyond being a once-useful term misappropriated from black American vernacular – apparently represent that of deeper thinking, inquiry and action, but can just as easily be used to paint a deceptive veneer. A true measure of character should be how high the stakes are. Will this opinion/collaboration/action lose followers, customers, or will it boost the brand?  I could think of no one more bold than our favourite Sagittarius, who risked her career to campaign against the Vietnam war. Her actions essentially lead to a blacklist. She orchestrated her return to the screen mostly so that she could raise more money for various social causes. To be back in the spotlight despite continuing distrust of her integrity takes guts. Yes, she’s wealthy – but it’s a wealth that has for the most part been distributed, whether being funnelled into socialist movements, Native American struggles, or the Black Panthers when they were at their most prominent. Profits from the film “9 to 5” were donated to union groups; profits from her workout tapes were distributed in similar ways. Even during the recent protests, she’s personally committed to bailing out anyone else who’s been arrested alongside her. Commenters have speculated that her getting arrested takes away attention from those protesting with her, many of whom are non-white and less able to defend themselves against those state forces which so often target and undermine the disenfranchised. Many celebrities (and non-celebrities for that matter) can be queasy when it comes to understanding their own whiteness – self-flagellating, deflecting, joking about it or ignoring it altogether, rather than distributing wealth, connections and access to those who may need it more (a point demonstrated by Oliver Reeson in their critique of Cyrus Grace Dunham’s new book).  If we’ve been given these protections, it might be more constructive to talk back at them, use them, putting our bodies between those who can’t do the same, undermining the reason that whiteness exists altogether. Activists have known this for years. Understanding the function of “arrestables” is common practice for those in frontline struggles. This isn’t performative – it’s a much needed show of solidarity, and one that can usurp the damage that state violence enacts upon so many of us. • Jonno Revanche is a writer and photographer based in Sydney and Adelaide"
"The Trump administration’s hostility towards climate action and research leaves a void in global climate politics. Could China step up? The world’s largest absolute emitter could certainly use US inaction as an excuse to backslide on its promises of greenery. But China could instead see this as an opportunity to project itself as our planet’s leading custodian. Evidence suggests the latter course is far more likely. Opening the annual National People’s Congress in March, premier Li Keqiang pledged to “make the sky blue again”. Both the report he presented and the legislation and decisions reached continued to stress environmental issues, albeit perhaps not as emphatically as in recent years.  Meanwhile, in January at the annual World Economic Forum pow-wow in Davos, president Xi Jinping took advantage of Trump’s economic nationalism to affirm China’s commitment to globalisation. As the US rejects the very idea of global responsibilities, China is thus apparently aiming to reap the rewards of positioning itself as the polar opposite.  This isn’t just empty rhetoric. Chinese investment overseas in green technology increased by 60% last year to US$32 billion. More importantly, the broader context of Chinese domestic politics has created strong incentives for further environmental efforts. This suggests an authentic medium to long-term commitment. And in China, it is the “dog” of domestic politics and regime legitimacy that wags the “tail” of geopolitical strategising. The environment is already a massive and potentially explosive issue within China. The increasingly powerful urban middle classes are becoming ever-more aware of environmental issues, particularly those that affect their health, such as air pollution or food, soil and water safety. The government’s key programme to make manufacturing more innovative is also intimately tied to environmental goals and the opportunities of “cleantech” such as electric cars). Even China’s digital giants including Alibaba and Tencent are more interested in the environment than their equivalents
in Silicon Valley. There are even broader factors at play too. As the country has grown in both domestic prosperity and global stature over the past 40 years it has gradually been compelled to address with ever-greater urgency its own central question. This is: how will China once again be the unquestioned centre of the world?  Restoring civilisational preeminence is easier said than done, however, especially given the starting place for these efforts. The past 200 years have seen a violent repudiation of traditional cultures and painful engagement with Western-dominated modernity. This remains a sensitive wound. For central to the Chinese concept of a unique “Chineseness” is both its unsurpassed cultural greatness and its unrivalled longevity.  Embryonic “soft power” efforts have proven problematic, which calls into question the universal appeal of Chinese culture. Meanwhile, traditional ideas such as Confucianism occupy only peripheral roles in contemporary life. This exposes both the comparative youth of modern China and the unresolved legacies of its traumatic breaks with its past. The situation creates twinned dissonances: between China’s actual and “rightful” standing in the world and between its actual and desired relation to its own traditional culture. Crucially, though, protecting the environment is seen by the government as a key opportunity in both cases. Hence Beijing’s leading slogan of “ecological civilization” – significantly a civilizational project that also, inseparably, has environmental sustainability at its heart.  The idea here is to draw on and renew distinctively Chinese ideas of Confucian harmony between humans and nature. This, it is hoped, could present a China to the world whose culture uniquely qualifies it to be the global environmental saviour. And it could reconnect the Chinese themselves to their traditional cultures, updated for a contemporary world of environmental responsibility. Progress is unlikely to be smooth. China’s one-party state does allow for the massive mobilisation of resources crucial to the major projects of sustainable transitions. But that same political structure – best described as “fragmented authoritarianism” – also makes it harder to foster cutting-edge innovation and harder to implement environmental regulations – and to involve different stakeholders in decision-making. As such, China still lags behind the US in the global game of cultural hegemony. Yet its grand project of “ecological civilization” is so important in contemporary domestic politics that the environment will likely be seen as China’s trump card for some time yet. If America chooses to play its hand badly in the meantime, this will simply be welcomed in Beijing as a further stroke of good luck."
"The research submarine Boaty McBoatface is about to be used for the first time. Boaty is world-famous thanks to its name: the result of a joke entry to a naming contest that went viral, but few know what the sub will actually do. Well, I am currently lead scientist on RRS James Clark Ross, Boaty’s parent ship, which just set sail from Chile. Here’s what we want to find out. Around the world, deeper ocean waters have been steadily warming over the past few decades, faster than we would expect simply through overall climate change. This suggests that global warming has triggered some sort of a change in deep sea circulation, which has sent extra heat into the lowest layers of the ocean. On its maiden voyage, Boaty will help us investigate why this is. The process begins in the seas near the Antarctic coast. As they are blasted by freezing winds blowing off the continent’s vast ice sheet, the waters become cold and dense, and sink into the abyss. Those waters then spread northward to the rest of the globe in streams that flow along the ocean floor.  Along the way, these deep water streams encounter several submarine mountain ranges, the very peaks of which can appear above the surface as islands like South Georgia (where Ernest Shackleton famously sailed to after becoming stranded in Antarctica). When the streams run into these mountains they meander around and across them, forming highly turbulent rapids and waterfalls along the way – very much like rivers do on the Earth’s surface.  We don’t yet know what causes the recent deep ocean warming, but the available evidence suggests that these rapids and waterfalls are at the heart of the issue. Scientists believe that strengthening winds over the Southern Ocean have caused the deep water streams to speed up, and become more turbulent in the areas where they have to negotiate mountains and ridges. More turbulence means increasingly vigorous mixing of cold deep waters with warmer water from the upper ocean, leading to overall warming at the bottom of the ocean. To test this hypothesis and identify how changing winds and deep ocean warming are linked, a team of UK and US scientists, including myself, has set off on a 52-day expedition to the Southern Ocean. We’ll focus on the Orkney Passage – a 3,000-metre deep, narrow gorge in a large submarine mountain range which about a quarter of all the deep water flowing northward from Antarctica squeezes through. As water flows through the passage we’ll get detailed measurements of its speed, temperature and turbulence. We’ll use a combination of vertical profilers deployed from the ship, instruments moored to the ocean floor, and the autonomous underwater vehicle Autosub Long Range – widely known, of course, as Boaty McBoatface. Boaty is a cutting-edge unmanned submarine that can perform missions that last several days, cover distances of hundreds of kilometres, and dive down to 6,000 metres. These subs mean scientists can access some of the most remote and hazardous environments in the ocean. Boaty’s mission will be to ride along the deep-water stream as it finds its way through the Orkney Passage, measuring every meander, rapid and waterfall in much greater detail than is possible with mainstream oceanographic instrumentation. The data collected by Boaty will be key to unravelling how the deep water turbulence in the passage is regulated by changing winds.  Our ultimate goal is to learn enough about what happens when deep water streams hit submarine mountain ranges to represent these processes (for the first time) in the models used to predict how our climate will evolve over the 21st century – and beyond."
"The Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg has refused to accept an environmental award, saying the climate movement needed people in power to start to “listen” to “science” and not awards. The young climate activist, who has rallied millions to her “Fridays for Future” movement, was honoured at a Stockholm ceremony held by the Nordic Council, a regional body for inter-parliamentary cooperation.  She had been nominated for her efforts by both Sweden and Norway and won the organisation’s annual environment prize. But after it was announced, a representative for Thunberg told the audience that she would not accept the award or the prize sum of 350,000 Danish kroner (about $52,000 or €46,800), the TT news agency reported. She addressed the decision in a post on Instagram from the United States. “The climate movement does not need any more awards,” she wrote. “What we need is for our politicians and the people in power start to listen to the current, best available science.” While thanking the Nordic Council for the “huge honour”, she also criticised Nordic countries for not living up to their “great reputation” on climate issues. “There is no lack of bragging about this. There is no lack of beautiful words. But when it comes to our actual emissions and our ecological footprints per capita … then it’s a whole other story,” Thunberg said. Still only 16 years old, Thunberg rose to prominence after she started spending her Fridays outside Sweden’s parliament in August 2018, holding a sign reading “School strike for climate”."

In my last post I mentioned that the English language Spiegel here has a comprehensive piece on the IPCC’s ideological struggle on whether or not to include the 15-year warming hiatus in the AR5 Summary Report.
Spiegel quotes Mike Hulme who says that the German delegation is “certainly more in the direction of ‘alarmist’” and thus are insisting that the warming hiatus not be mentioned. Why not? Spiegel tells us why (my emphasis):
German Green Party politician Hermann Ott, on the other hand, is satisfied with Germany’s conduct in the negotiations. Since Helmut Kohl’s government, Ott says, there has generally been consensus on the significance of climate protection, making it possible for “a great deal of continuity and a high level of expertise” to develop within Germany’s Federal Ministry for the Environment.
Despite resistance from many researchers, the German ministries insist that it is important not to detract from the effectiveness of climate change warnings by discussing the past 15 years’ lack of global warming. Doing so, they say, would result in a loss of the support necessary for pursuing rigorous climate policies. “Climate policy needs the element of fear,” Ott openly admits. “Otherwise, no politician would take on this topic.”
Unbelievable. Ott is saying that the German government and its Ministry of Environment, where his good friend Jochen Flasbarth is a director, needs a report that scares the public! We appreciate the honesty.
Also, someone needs to remind Hermann Ott that there hasn’t been any warming since Helmut Kohl’s government ended in 1998 – completely contradicting the models. In fact, there hasn’t been much warming since the IPCC’s second report from 1995!

"Despite extensive media coverage, campaigns and scientists’ warnings, still the world is not fully aware of what coral bleaching is and why it is happening. Mention bleaching and some think that it is the death of the Great Barrier Reef’s coral, but the problem is much more widespread. “Bleaching” is when corals lose the highly productive algae (termed zooxanthellae) from their tissues due to stress from high sea temperatures and solar irradiation. The algae and coral have a symbiotic relationship: the algae remove the coral’s waste products while the coral gives the algae a safe environment to live in, and provides compounds for photosynthesis. Without the algae, the coral no longer has a sufficient source of food, meaning that it essentially starves to death. Due to its iconic status and numerous nearby scientific institutes, the Great Barrier Reef often receives the most attention when it comes to coral bleaching. But there are many other reefs across the globe that are experiencing the same problem. These reef provinces encompass undeveloped, remote and unpopulated areas, where, unlike near the Great Barrier Reef, monitoring and research is either non-existent, scarce or sporadic.  The Chagos Archipelago is a British overseas territory located in the middle of the Indian Ocean, consisting of 55 islands distributed across six atolls, and covering an area the size of France. It certainly fulfils the remote criterion: the Maldives are the next island group, 300 miles to the north, and it is more than 900 miles to the more substantial landmass of the Indian subcontinent. In total, the reefs and shallow banks cover some 60,000km² – nearly three times the size of Wales. For the past decade, we have been carrying out research in the Chagos Archipelago. What we have found is that although reefs vary in condition across the large archipelago, most were vibrant during earlier surveys and managed to rebound from the first major bleaching event in 1997/98 – when around 16% of the world’s coral was killed, and only about 10% of living coral was left to some 30m depth.  After the 2015 global bleaching event occurred, we knew that the Chagos Archipelago had been affected, but it was only during our 2016 survey that we found the bleaching had been as bad as it was in 1997/98. We were struck by the stark increase in dead coral, mostly the branching Acropora which form wide table-like structures, similar to a canopy, over large portions of the reef. We found that on reefs dominated by this coral type, more than 50% of the live coral which was present in 2015 has died in shallow areas. What is most alarming is that these surveys took place immediately before the 2016 bleaching event began in earnest, and went on to surpass 2015 in severity. The true condition of the reefs within the Chagos Archipelago at present is unknown, as we haven’t yet been able to revisit the study sites. We also don’t know when, or if, a 2017 bleaching event will occur on the Chagos Archipelago. But based on global sea temperature patterns so far, and early indications of bleaching starting on the Great Barrier Reef – which usually precedes events in the Indian Ocean – a 2017 event could begin in a matter of weeks. This could very well be the start of a new era for the coral reefs of the Indian Ocean and beyond. Of course, bleaching itself is not a new phenomenon, having been first recorded in 1911 in the Florida Keys, and is likely to have occurred, certainly at local scales, throughout the last several millennia of global reef growth. What is completely new, however, is this frequency of bleaching events: if a 2017 event materialises it will be part of an unprecedented “hat-trick” of yearly back-to-back mass coral bleachings. Corals may recover from mild and infrequent bleaching events, but will die from severe and repeated loss of their algal symbionts. Scientists warned in 1999 that if global warming patterns continued, reefs in the Indian Ocean could start to bleach every five to 10 years by 2010. Unfortunately, it appears these predictions have been met and may even be surpassed in the next decade. There is no easy way to stop coral bleaching. A frequent suggestion is to focus on removing localised impacts and stressors such as over-fishing and excess nutrient inputs from agriculture. However, the Chagos islands are already devoid of these pressures, and yet appear to be equally susceptible to the effects of global warming as more populated reef areas.  Though we don’t know if these reefs can bounce back from bleaching, based on the previous pattern following the 1998 global bleaching event – where up to 90% of corals died in some parts of the Chagos Archipelago – the reefs could take a decade or more to recover. But if these yearly repeat bleachings carry on, it could be like pressing the reset button on each trajectory of recovery just as it gets underway. Nonetheless, it could be argued that if anywhere has a chance of recovery the Chagos Archipelago does, and by continuing to research this location we may learn more about what factors promote and drive reef recovery in the process."
"Green politics is associated with the left these days, but that doesn’t rule out an eco-friendly turn at the opposite end of the spectrum. After all, nationalist worries over finite resources and talk of “threats to tradition” have been echoed throughout the history of the green movement. So, is a far right environmentalism possible? And if so, given climate change is hugely disruptive for any form of traditional nationalist idyll, how long before far right groups join the likes of Greenpeace on the frontlines? Modern forms of green activism emerged in the 1960s in a context of threats like acid rain or increasing pesticide use which transcended national boundaries. The EU in the early 1970s also began to grapple with environmental problems that could no longer be effectively managed by individual states. This form of green activism thus showed that the nation state had failed to protect citizens against environmental problems. As such, it drew upon an older tradition that in the 1800s reacted against the perceived attacks on humanity and nature by capitalist interests by calling for a return to the land.  This could give early environmentalism a left-wing flavour, as in the Winter Hill trespass of 1896 when thousands of people in Bolton reclaimed an ancient right of way through private land. But the disruption that modernisation brings also produced a range of responses that could be termed “green nationalism”. The far right respond to threats they perceive to custom, culture, identity and locales posed by cosmopolitan elites. They usually have settler value systems that express pessimism and victimhood, emphasise threats rather than opportunities and see conspiracies as explanations for the degradation of their personal and group life-chances and local environment.  This leads to a green nationalism of defensive parochialism in which degradation of local features are opposed because they negatively affect customs – such as tending allotments, or the retention of the village green – threaten the familiar locale, and represent the effects of distrusted outsiders.  How this plays out in practice seems to depend upon which outsiders they distrust. In the US there are Tea Party environmentalists who have been mobilised, for instance, by the impact of polluting energy companies. However, a tradition of blaming government not business, along with diversionary nationalist propaganda (Drill here! Drill now!) funded by wealthy oil barons, has meant these same activists are often vehement opponents of better environmental regulation. In contrast, far right groups in Britain seem simply to ignore the environmental threats posed by extreme energy extraction such as fracking. The landscape is a key element in national identity throughout the world. A defence of that landscape against perceived threats can so become an environmentalism focused on preserving the distinctive characteristics of a nation’s land, from the rolling green fields of England to the snow-capped mountains of Switzerland.  This has often been accompanied by other ways of reasserting identity. Myths of a pagan past in harmony with nature have been a feature of green nationalism, from its beginnings through to the Anastasia ecovillages in contemporary Russia where, unlike their equivalent hippy communes found in the West, sustainable living is combined with a “reactionary eco-nationalism”. Such myths give identity and meaning to some groups attracted to the far right, such as the skinhead movement that emerged in Britain in the 1960s, while also providing imagined alternatives to the drudgery associated with modern capitalism or the compromises of democracy. The other aspect of the green movement that is appropriated by the far right is the concern about the depletion of key resources by unchecked usage. At its most cynical, this can be a far right equivalent of business “greenwashing”. However, it also reflects a tendency to see economics and society as a zero-sum game in which every gain for others is a loss for the victimised groups they see themselves as. Concerns about finite resources therefore align with anxieties about immigration. Far right groups and their media supporters are swift to exploit fears of threats to the local animals allegedly posed by immigrants. Such baseless hostility is then compounded by the widespread and equally erroneous view that England’s green and pleasant land has already largely disappeared under concrete. Green causes are not usually the main motivating factor for those attracted to the far right. This does not mean, however, that their espousal is mere greenwashing.  The far right tends to think of green issues differently from their left-wing counterparts. Their approach focuses on the local, not the global, and reflects the centrality of landscape to national identities. Their defensive parochialism means that these threats are usually seen in cultural terms through the appropriation of victimhood, hence the tendency to focus upon immigration as opposed to the emphases of left-wing environmentalists.  Green issues tend to be seen by the far right through the distinct lenses of cultural identity and the land. That does not necessarily prevent, however, the emergence of a green nationalism."
"Scientists have just discovered massive amounts of a rare metal called tellurium, a key element in cutting-edge solar technology. As a solar expert who specialises in exactly this, I should be delighted. But here’s the catch: the deposit is found at the bottom of the sea, in an undisturbed part of the ocean.  People often have an idealised view of solar as the perfect clean energy source. Direct conversion of sunlight to electricity, no emissions, no oil spills or contamination, perfectly clean. This however overlooks the messy reality of how solar panels are produced. While the energy produced is indeed clean, some of the materials required to generate that power are toxic or rare. In the case of one particular technology, cadmium telluride-based solar cells, the cadmium is toxic and the telluride is hard to find. Cadmium telluride is one of the second generation “thin-film” solar cell technologies. It’s far better at absorbing light than silicon, on which most solar power is currently based, and as a result its absorbing layer doesn’t need to be as thick. A layer of cadmium telluride just one thousandth of a millimetre thick will absorb around 90% of the light that hits it. It’s cheap and quick to set up, compared to silicon, and uses less material. As a result, it’s the first thin-film technology to effectively make the leap from the research laboratory to mass production. Cadmium telluride solar modules now account for around 5% of global installations and, depending on how you do the sums, can produce lower cost power than silicon solar. But cadmium telluride’s Achilles heel is the tellurium itself, one of the rarest metals in the Earth’s crust. Serious questions must be asked about whether technology based on such a rare metal is worth pursuing on a massive scale.  There has always been a divide in opinion about this. The abundancy data for tellurium suggests a real issue, but the counter argument is that no-one has been actively looking for new reserves of the material. After all, platinum and gold are similarly rare but demand for jewellery and catalytic converters (the primary use of platinum) means in practice we are able to find plenty.  The discovery of a massive new tellurium deposit in an underwater mountain in the Atlantic Ocean certainly supports the “it will turn up eventually” theory. And this is a particularly rich ore, according to the British scientists involved in the MarineE-Tech project which found it. While most tellurium is extracted as a by-product of copper mining and so is relatively low yield, their seabed samples contain concentrations 50,000 times higher than on land. Extracting any of this will be formidably hard and very risky for the environment. The top of the mountain where the tellurium has been discovered is still a kilometre below the waves, and the nearest land is hundreds of miles away. Even on dry land, mining is never a good thing for the environment. It can uproot communities, decimate forests and leave huge scars on the landscape. It often leads to groundwater contamination, despite whatever safeguards are put in place.  And on the seabed? Given the technical challenges and the pristine ecosystems involved, I think most people can intuitively guess at the type of devastation that deep-sea mining could cause. No wonder it has yet to be implemented anywhere yet, despite plans off the coast of Papua New Guinea and elsewhere. Indeed, there’s no suggestion that tellurium mining is liable to occur at this latest site any time soon. However the mere presence of such resources, or the wind turbines or electric car batteries that rely on scarce materials or risky industrial processes, raises an interesting question. These are useful low-carbon technologies, but do they also have a requirement to be environmentally ethical?  There is often the perception that everyone working in renewable energy is a lovely tree-hugging, sandal-wearing leftie, but this isn’t the case. After all, this is now a huge industry, one that is aiming to eventually supplant fossil fuels, and there are valid concerns over whether such expansion will be accompanied by a softening of regulations. We know that solar power is ultimately a good thing, but do the ends always justify the means? Or, to put it more starkly: could we tolerate mass production of solar panels if it necessitated mining and drilling on a similar scale to the fossil fuels industry, along with the associated pitfalls?  To my mind the answer is undoubtedly yes, we have little choice. After all, mass solar would still wipe out our carbon emissions, helping curb global warming and the associated apocalypse.  What’s reassuring is that, even as solar becomes a truly mature industry, it has started from a more noble and environmentally sound place. Cadmium telluride modules for example include a cost to cover recycling, while scarce resources such as tellurium can be recovered from panels at the end of their 20-year or more lifespan (compare this with fossil fuels, where the materials that produce the power are irreparably lost in a bright flame and a cloud of carbon).  The impact of mining for solar panels will likely be minimal in comparison to the oil or coal industries, but it will not be zero. As renewable technology becomes more crucial, we perhaps need to start calibrating our expectations to account for this. At some point mining operations in search of solar or wind materials will cause damage or else some industrial production process will go awry and cause contamination. This may be the Faustian pact we have to accept, as the established alternatives are far worse. Unfortunately nothing is perfect."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe English language Spiegel magazine has lengthy piece on the crumbling climate science consensus. Yes folks, soon we’ll be hearing that 97% of all climate scientists say there is no consensus.
This Spiegel piece is tantamount to yet another cruise missile direct hit on alarmist climate science. The alarmist climate science bunker appears to have finally been breached. Now even IPCC scientists are abandoning ship.
The AR5 has not even yet been released and already it’s facing Cat 5 hurricane headwinds from major global media outlets. Keep in mind that Spiegel used to be as warmist as they came. Now they are as non-consensus as they come.
Warming Plateau? Climatologists Face Inconvenient Truth
Data shows global temperatures aren’t rising the way climate scientists have predicted. Now the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change faces a problem: publicize these findings and encourage skeptics — or hush up the figures.
For a quarter of a century now, environmental activists have been issuing predictions in the vein of the Catholic Church, warning people of the coming greenhouse effect armageddon. Environmentalists bleakly predict global warming will usher in plagues of biblical dimensions — perpetual droughts, deluge-like floods and hurricanes of unprecedented force.

"The government has halted fracking in England with immediate effect in a watershed moment for environmentalists and community activists. Ministers also warned shale gas companies it would not support future fracking projects, in a crushing blow to companies that had been hoping to capitalise on one of the new frontiers of growth in the fossil fuel industry. The decision draws a line under years of bitter opposition to the controversial extraction process in a major victory for green groups and local communities. The decision was taken after a new scientific study warned it was not possible to rule out “unacceptable” consequences for those living near fracking sites. The report, undertaken by the Oil and Gas Authority (OGA), also warned it was not possible to predict the magnitude of earthquakes fracking might trigger. Fracking, also known as hydraulic fracturing, involves pumping water, chemicals and sand underground at high pressure to fracture shale rock and release trapped oil and gas. The government said it would not agree to any future fracking “until compelling new evidence is provided” that proves fracking could be safe. The UK’s only active fracking site at Preston New Road in Lancashire was brought to an immediate halt this summer after fracking triggered multiple earth tremors that breached the government’s earthquake limits. Andrea Leadsom, the business and energy secretary, said the government has always been clear that shale gas exploration in the UK must be carried out safely. “After reviewing the OGA’s report into recent seismic activity at Preston New Road, it is clear that we cannot rule out future unacceptable impacts on the local community. For this reason, I have concluded that we should put a moratorium on fracking in England with immediate effect,” she said. The moratorium marks a major U-turn for the Conservative party and the prime minister Boris Johnson, who once referred to fracking as “glorious news for humanity” and urged the UK to “leave no stone unturned, or unfracked” in pursuit of shale gas. The government ended its support for the struggling industry less than a week after a damning report from Whitehall’s spending watchdog found its plans to establish fracking across the UK was dragging years behind schedule and had cost the taxpayer at least £32m so far without producing any energy in return. Rebecca Newsom, the head of politics at Greenpeace UK, said it has “been clear for some time that the government’s big bet on fracking is bust”. The decision has been welcomed as a “victory for common sense” by green groups and campaigners who have fought for almost a decade against the controversial fossil fuel extraction process. Craig Bennett, the chief executive of Friends of the Earth, said: “This moratorium is a tremendous victory for communities and the climate. For nearly a decade local people across the country have fought a David and Goliath battle against this powerful industry. We are proud to have been part of that fight.” Tom Fyans, from CPRE, said the countryside charity would “celebrate alongside the local communities, campaigners and environmentalists who have been campaigning valiantly to stop fracking for many years”. Fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, is a way of extracting natural gas from shale rock formations that are often deep underground. It involves pumping water, chemicals and usually sand underground at high pressure to fracture shale – hence the name – and release the gas trapped within to be collected back at the surface. The technology has transformed the US energy landscape in the last decade, owing to the combination of high-volume fracking – 1.5m gallons of water per well, on average – and the relatively modern ability to drill horizontally into shale after a vertical well has been drilled. In England, the government placed a moratorium on fracking in November 2019 after protests, legal challenges and planning rejections. A year earlier, the energy company Cuadrilla was forced to stop work at its Preston New Road site in Lancashire twice in four days due to minor earthquakes occurring while it was fracking. The tremors breached a seismic threshold imposed after fracking caused minor earthquakes at a nearby Cuadrilla site in 2011. In March 2019 the high court ruled that the government's fracking guidelines were unlawful because they had failed to sufficiently consider scientific evidence against fracking. “This is a fantastic win for local democracy and everyone who cares about protecting the countryside from climate catastrophe and mass industrialisation,” he said. Rebecca Long Bailey MP, the shadow business and energy secretary, said the moratorium was a victory for local people and the government owed them an apology. She said: “When the Tory government overruled local democratic decisions to halt fracking, communities did not give up. When fracking protesters went to jail, communities did not give up. And now they have forced the government to U-turn. “The Tories owe the public an apology, and an explanation of how much public money they wasted while ignoring the science.” Long-Bailey said the government could yet allow fracking to restart. “The next Labour government will ban fracking – whereas the Tories will only call a temporary halt to it. You can’t trust a word the prime minister says.” The government revealed its fracking moratium alongside plans for a major review of the UK’s transition to a green economy. The Treasury said it will assess how the UK can make the most of the economic green shoots which are expected to emerge while moving towards a carbon neutral economy by 2050. Sajid Javid, the chancellor, said the review was a vital next step” in delivering the government’s 2050 climate target while “supporting growth and lancing costs” to avoid “placing unfair burdens on families or businesses”. “We must all play a part in protecting the planet for future generations,” he added. The Treasury’s support for a green economy comes after Downing Street shot down claims made by the former chancellor, Philip Hammond, that tackling the climate crisis would cost £1tn and require spending cuts for schools, hospitals and the police force. In a swift rebuke, No 10 said plans to create a net zero-carbon economy would cost no more than the UK’s existing plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The interim report will be published in the spring, ahead of a final report in the autumn before the global UN climate talks, which will take place in Glasgow. Simon Clarke, the exchequer secretary to the Treasury, said it was “humbling to launch this unprecedented review into how we end the UK’s contribution to climate change”. “Until recently people said that ‘Net Zero’ was impossible, but this work is a giant step towards making it happen, enabling us to set out a roadmap for an economy that is cleaner, more efficient, and works for everyone, while preserving our planet,” he said. • This article was corrected on 2 November 2019 to make clear that the government has halted, but not banned fracking as stated in an earlier version, and that the moratorium applies only to England as it is a devolved issue. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland already have measures in place against fracking."

Back in May we had extensive discussion about the unusually cold spring conditions, which broke some longstanding records in Fairbanks – including the latest date with daily mean temperature below freezing (May 18). With the early arrival of freezing conditions this month, it should be no surprise that the length of the continuous summer thaw season was the shortest on record in Fairbanks…

"Mining giant Rio Tinto says its Australian Aluminium smelters, which employ more than 2,600 workers, are not sustainable at current power prices. The company runs three smelters in Australia, which are under financial pressure due to the high price of electricity, which makes up about a third of their costs, and the low price of aluminium due to a flood of cheap supply coming from Asian competitors. The resources minister, Matt Canavan, has recently championed the industry, saying Australia was “one of the best aluminium producers in the world” and claiming it needed a continued supply of “cheap baseload” electricity from coal. • Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “If we turn our back on coal, you turn out the lights on aluminium, it’s as simple as that,” he told ABC Radio last week. However, speaking in London on Thursday night, the chief executive of Rio Tinto’s aluminium division, Alf Barrios, issued a blunt warning that current prices from coal-fired power were too high. He said this was despite “fantastic work” done by the team at the Australian smelter division, Pacific, to improve the performance of the plants.  “However power accounts for about a third of the global cost of the smelters and the smelters at Pacific do lack internationally competitive energy prices, which undermines the viability of these assets,” he said. “We are working very closely with the power suppliers and the governments to find a solution to this challenge. “I’m not going to speculate on the outcome but clearly the current situation is not sustainable.” The warning comes after Rio Tinto boss Jean-Sebastian Jacques warned in August that Australian smelters were “on thin ice” and follows the company flagging last week that it might close its New Zealand smelter. Barrios was speaking to reporters ahead of a quarterly update to investors that listed “low-carbon technology” as a priority for its aluminium business. The company’s head of economics, Vivek Tulpule, said the profitability of aluminium was “challenged by the quick and cheap expansion of supply to meet growth in demand”. “This underlines the value of our position in Canada with operating costs in the bottom decile of the cost curve supported by hydro power which will become increasingly important in a carbon-constrained world,” he said. The company is also exploring making greenhouse gas-free aluminium as part of a wider project to reduce its emissions."

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhat is now happening with Arctic sea ice?
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited with permission by P Gosselin)
Summer is now in full swing and the Arctic sea ice that formed over the wintertime is now steadily melting. Typically the minimum in sea ice extent is reached in mid September. Last year (2012) a new melt record was reached for the satellite era, which however only officially started in 1979. How does it look this year?
The Center for Ocean and Ice of the Danish Ocean Meteorological Service provides a new ice graphic on a daily basis and so that the situation can be monitored. The Arctic sea ice extent of 2013 is depicted by the bold dark line on the chart below (Figure 1). This year there is considerably more ice than there was over the three previous years, which perhaps has something to do with the especially hard winter and the late summer start. It remains to be seen how this will develop further. Also in Alaska and the Baltic Sea larger than normal sea ice areas were observed.

Figure 1: Arctic sea ice extent over the years. Source: DMI.
In the meantime it has been officially confirmed that the north polar ice minimum of 2012 was mostly caused by a powerful storm. Three new studies have been able document this (Simmonds & Rudeva 2012, Parkinson & Comiso 2013 and Zhang et al. 2013). The storm ripped apart the ice cover and scattered the ice to the oceans. Also playing a role was the reduced ice thickness. The high temperatures of the current moderm warm period has helped to reduce the sea ice thickness over time, thus allowing the wind to have an easier time than it did earlier.
How did things look before the satellite age?
Here we find some surprises: Thin, shrinking ice was also common in earlier times, but it was not possible to measure it extensively. One phase of especially low sea ice in the Arctic occurred between 1920 and 1950 when submarines were able to surface in ice-free waters directly at the North Pole. A good overview of this period can be found at Judith Curry’s blog.

Now how does that fit with the notion that sea ice would move only in one direction, namely shrink? Strictly speaking the satellite era of sea ice measurement did not begin in 1979, but already a few years earlier. And if these data are accounted for, then an unexplainable disruption occurs in the curve as shown by (Figure 2). The sea ice coverage of 1973-1975 was significantly less than it was at the “official” start of the dataset: 1979. Interestingly this graphic had been included in the first IPCC climate report, but then it was left out in the subsequent reports because it did not fit with the desired catastrophe narrative.

Figure 2: Arctic sea ice extent 1973-1990. From the IPCC AR1.
Slowly scientists are now finding out how fluctuations in Arctic sea ice could be happening. In a paper published in the International Journal of Climatology a team of scientists were able to show that sea ice extent in the western Arctic ocean is 40-79% controlled by natural ocean cycles. Among these is the Arctic Oscillation (AO). Another team of scientists from MIT generated improved Arctic sea ice prognoses where ocean cycles and the associated patterns play a more important role.
When natural ocean cycles are taken into account, then one needs not wonder when the sea ice season in the Beaufort Sea in the Canadian Arctic lasts considerably longer than it did in the late 19th century and the first half of the 20th century. This is shown in the journal of Biogeosciences where the authors reconstructed sea ice cover over the last 150 years. While sea ice covers the the Beaufort sea an average of 9.4 months per year today, earlier it was only 8.3 months. Back then water in this sea was about 3°C warmer than today. According to this new study the Arctic Oscillation and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) played a great role.
The search for other factors effecting Arctic sea ice coverage continues on. There is evidence that the the sun could have a hand in the game. Also changes in measurement methodology and the evaluation routines have caused jumps in the curves. Does a melting Arctic present only disadvantages? It does not make a contribution to sea level rise because there is almost no net water displacement by floating ice that melts. Judith Curry’s blog names a few economic advantages of a low-ice Arctic Ocean.
Finally everyone wants to know how the Arctic sea ice will develop further. A couple of decades ago scientists were predicting an ice-free Arctic already for today. As this prediction failed to materialize, the date was promptly postponed to 2030. In the journal of Geophysical Research Letters, a team of scientists took a closer look and made more comprehensive calculations. Their result: If one assumes even the most aggressive warming prognoses, an ice-free north polar sea summer could be expected only at the end of the 21st century and a year-round ice-free Arctic Ocean at the end of the 23rd century.

"For the millions of people who descend on Munich for the annual bash, Oktoberfest is a celebration of beer, bands and bratwurst. But as the dust settles for another year on the world’s largest folk festival, and die Bierleichen (“beer corpses”) return to the land of the living, environmental scientists have released the first analysis of methane emissions from the 16-day party.  Researchers at Technical University in Munich walked and cycled around the perimeter of the festival last year with mobile sensors aloft. The instruments found the event emitted nearly 1,500kg of methane – 10 times the amount that wafted off Boston, Massachusetts, in the same period. The scientists attributed most of Oktoberfest’s emissions to leaks and incomplete combustion in cooking and heating appliances. Though an appreciable part of the rise in the gas, about 10%, was attributed to the flatulence and burps of attendees. Jia Chen, who studies greenhouse gases in urban environments, said: “The observed methane concentrations cannot solely be explained by biogenic sources. “We have strong indications that fossil fuel methane emissions by gas grills and heating appliances are major sources.” After carbon dioxide, methane is the second most common greenhouse gas emitted by human activity. Though shorter-lived, it is more effective than carbon dioxide at heating the atmosphere and accounts for about 20% of global heating due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions since 1750. Atmospheric levels of the gas have surged in recent years for reasons scientists cannot fully explain. Having noticed a spike in Munich’s methane levels during Oktoberfest in previous years, Chen and her colleagues decided to monitor the event to see whether major festivals made important contributions to greenhouse gas emissions. More than six million people visit Oktoberfest each year and make their way through more than seven million litres of beer, 100,000 litres of wine, half a million chickens and a quarter of a million sausages. To Chen’s surprise, on average, every square metre of Oktoberfest in 2018 released 6.7 micrograms of methane per second. Less than 10% was calculated to come from festivalgoers in the form of flatulence and burps, according to a paper submitted to the journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics. Chen believes the work can help festival organisers draw up policies to reduce their methane emissions. The study concludes the releases of methane are high enough for major festivals to be considered greenhouse gas sources in local emissions inventories. “Large but time-limited festivals, like Oktoberfest, are sources that have not been accounted for in existing emission inventories, even though, as we have seen, the methane emissions are significant,” Chen said. “Inaccurate or incomplete emission inventories are a problem, because many decisionsare based on this data.” With people travelling to Oktoberfest from more than 50 countries, methane leaks from the Theresienwiese site are not the greatest environmental concern. But improving gas appliances to reduce methane emissions still makes sense, Chen said. “Small steps can bring us closer to achieving the world climate goals,” she added."
"It may be doubted whether there are many other animals which have played so important a part in the history of the world, as have these lowly organised creatures. – Charles Darwin, The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms (1881) Not all wildlife is created equal in our eyes. Take the earthworm, which doesn’t have the widespread appeal of larger, more charismatic animals such as gorillas, tigers or pandas. Worms are never going to get a strong “cute response”, and they won’t ever be the face of a conservation campaign. But what Darwin rightly recognised is that – panda fans avert your eyes – worm conservation is much more important once we factor in their provision of what we now call “ecosystem services”, which are crucial to human survival. Darwin spent 39 years studying these animals for a good reason. In fact, earthworms have even been ranked the number one most influential species in the history of the planet – above dinosaurs and humans.  Ecologists consider earthworms “keystone species” because of how much they influence the physical, chemical and biological properties of the soil. Here are five reasons why: 1) Earthworms are recyclers. They play a crucial role in breaking down organic matter and fertilising the soil, simply through their constant eating and pooping (about 1.5 times their body weight a day). What comes out the other end – known as a worm cast – is full of nutrients and bacteria that are beneficial for plants. Scientists have measured up to five times the amount of key nutrients in worm casts compared to surrounding soil.  A study in Hawaii found that replacing a portion of standard fertiliser with vermicompost (compost from worm casts) increased yields of crops such as tomatoes and strawberries by 30%. It’s hard to generate industrial amounts of worm cast, of course, and vermicompost remains more expensive than commercial fertiliser. But it’s an intriguing example of how earthworms can help humans. 2) Earthworms are great “soil engineers”. As they move through the soil, earthworms loosen and mix it up, helping to aerate and drain it. This brings nutrients to the surface, making the soil more fertile, and helps prevent flooding and erosion. 3) Earthworms are barometers of soil health and toxicity. They’re very sensitive to soil pollutants such as pesticide residues or unwanted heavy metals (zinc, lead and so on), and they are badly affected by changes in land use such as deforestation to clear the way for intensive farming. This means the health of local worms is proving to be a useful tool to assess the impact of different land usage and pollutants.  4) Juicy earthworms are an important food source. They are protein-rich and feed a number of animals, such as the European badger. 5) Earthworms can help repair damaged soil and may provide solutions to man-made problems. Research suggests that earthworms could help to clean up land contaminated with toxic heavy metals such as lead. Other studies show how earthworms can speed up the restoration of degraded land in the tropics, while research in northern Vietnam found that reduced earthworm diversity due to land use change also had a significant knock on effect on soil fertility, water drainage and soil erosion. So, earthworms are our underground allies – if we treat them right. Earthworms make it possible for us to live on the planet, simply by eating and pooping, and ploughing up, ventilating and fertilising the soil along the way.  Climate change and human intervention are fast-tracking the world’s loss of biodiversity. The plight of the tiger in India and the orangutan in Indonesia are well known, but scientists are also becoming concerned about earthworms and other animals that we are less familiar with, but which we can’t afford to lose. If pandas go extinct, it will be very sad. But, a world without earthworms? Arguably without earthworms in our soils, life could vanish pretty quickly. We would have less food, more pollution, and more flooding. No matter how cute a panda looks, it is Darwin’s “lowly” earthworms that are doing dirty, but crucial, work in the soil below."
"Oil giant Royal Dutch Shell is under fire from environmental groups over its proposal to decommission the Brent oilfield in the North Sea. The plans submitted to the government relate to four concrete and steel platforms which have been in service for 40 years.  The environmental groups, which include WWF Scotland and Greenpeace UK, are refusing to back Shell’s plans. They claim the company has not made enough information public to properly cross-reference its proposals against the internationally agreed OSPAR rules that are supposed to govern decommissioning.  Shell is one of a number of oil producers looking at decommissioning now that many North Sea oil and gas fields are reaching the end of their productive lives. Decommissioning is a massive, expensive and technically challenging task; and Brent is seen as a test case for the rest of the UK industry.  While the UK government mulls Shell’s proposals, there are a number of myths surrounding the decommissioning process that people need to be aware of. Shell said in its Brent proposal: “Shell and Esso will be paying the decommissioning costs. The tax relief we will get back is not a subsidy or a new cost to the taxpayer – it’s a refund – i.e. the tax has already been paid by Shell and Esso in previous years.” But by having tax rules that allow oil producers to reclaim taxes paid in previous years to cover the cost of decommissioning, the taxpayer does pay.  If decommissioning comes in at the approximate £50 billion estimate, the treasury (the taxpayer) will be down by around £25bn. If the costs are higher, the treasury will pay more – a huge risk to the taxpayer. As a result of this system, oil producers already reportedly became a net drain on the UK’s coffers for the first time in 2016, costing the taxpayer £396m.  Many marine habitat experts are saying there is little environmental benefit from removal. Indeed some of the decommissioning activities are expected to do more environmental harm than good. This is due to seabed disruption, noise and the removal process itself, which is very energy intensive and will therefore be a major source of harmful emissions.  If the architecture is left in place, it will naturally reef and arguably create an environmental positive. The reefing concept has been used extensively in the Gulf of Mexico with the Rigs to Reefs programme.  In an area which lacks natural reefs, this has enhanced the marine habitat for many species of fish. Admittedly some people have raised concerns about environmental damage from deteriorating metal and reefing disrupting the natural ecology, but one can certainly argue the positives outweigh any negatives.  As I have argued before, leaving this offshore infrastructure in place and using the savings from taxpayers’ money to fund green energy projects would be much more sensible. Alternatively, you could invest the money in recovering the country’s manufacturing base, NHS funding, education, marine conservation, improving flood defences or tackling poverty.  Numerous reports in the media have reflected claims like this. In reality, onshore activities are around 2%-3% of the overall decommissioning costs, and onshore jobs are only a fraction of that. The jobs are transient; once the task is complete, there is no follow-on activity.  If we chose the green energy option, it would provide many more sustainable jobs designing, fabricating and constructing the wind farms and other power sources; as well as continuous operations and maintenance jobs over their 30 to 40 year lifespans. The same could be said of many of my other suggested alternatives.  How can a decommissioning industry that produces nothing and uses billions of taxpayers’ money be good for the economy? It is about taking things to bits. While it’s true you create short-term employment and that the employees and service companies will pay taxes, you don’t build any factories or provide new infrastructure to serve society and the economy. Also, much of the removal money will go to the heavy-lift companies – the UK has none.  The Oil and Gas Authority (OGA), an executive agency of the UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) is also obliged to maximise the economic recovery of the country’s petroleum resources. How can the current plans for decommissioning be maximising economic recovery?  Again, to compare with my preferred option of leaving platforms in place and putting the money into green energy, this would clearly achieve more economic recovery. It would provide society and the economy with an essential commodity – power for industry, electric transport and heat for homes. The OGA has an objective of reducing decommissioning costs by around 35%, but the country can do far better – the authority should be lobbying Westminster accordingly.  When I raised the question of maximising economic recovery with OGA and BEIS, I was told their role is to ensure OSPAR is followed and not to challenge it. OSPAR is the mechanism by which 15 governments of the western coasts and catchments of Europe, together with the EU, cooperate to protect the marine environment of the northeast Atlantic. It broadly requires full removal of oil platforms at the end of their economic lives. As well intentioned as OSPAR is, the directives are taking the nation to a very poor outcome. We know so much more now than when the directives were agreed in 1998 – the consequences of global warming, for instance, hence the argument that green energy looks a better investment nowadays. Even OSPAR should be able to see green energy as having a much better outcome for the international community. Why is the UK not challenging the agreement?"

Share this...FacebookTwitterA paper by Duke University physicist Nicola Scafetta has just appeared in the journal Energy & Environment titled: Solar and planetary oscillation control on climate change: hind-cast, forecast and a comparison with the CMIP5 GCMs.
It’s another blow to those claiming high CO2 climate sensitivity.
The abstract reads (my emphasis):
Global surface temperature records (e.g. HadCRUT4) since 1850 are characterized by climatic oscillations synchronous with specific solar, planetary and lunar harmonics superimposed on a background warming modulation. The latter is related to a long millennial solar oscillation and to changes in the chemical composition of the atmosphere (e.g. aerosol and greenhouse gases). However, current general circulation climate models, e.g. the CMIP5 GCMs, to be used in the AR5 IPCC Report in 2013, fail to reconstruct the observed climatic oscillations. As an alternate, an empirical model is proposed that uses: (1) a specific set of decadal, multidecadal, secular and millennial astronomic harmonics to simulate the observed climatic oscillations; (2) a 0.45 attenuation of the GCM ensemble mean simulations to model the anthropogenic and volcano forcing effects. The proposed empirical model outperforms the GCMs by better hind-casting the observed 1850-2012 climatic patterns. It is found that: (1) about 50-60% of the warming observed since 1850 and since 1970 was induced by natural oscillations likely resulting from harmonic astronomical forcings that are not yet included in the GCMs; (2) a 2000-2040 approximately steady projected temperature; (3) a 2000-2100 projected warming ranging between 0.3°C and 1.6°C, which is significantly lower than the IPCC GCM ensemble mean projected warming of 1.1°C to 4.1°C; (4) an equilibrium climate sensitivity to CO2 doubling centered in 1.35°C and varying between 0.9°C and 2.0°C.

"The world’s governments will meet in Madrid this December to discuss the climate emergency, it has been confirmed, after a last-minute intervention by the Spanish government to save the talks. The conference had been set to take place in Santiago, Chile, but the government of President Sebastian Pinera decided on Wednesday to call it off because of the unrest in the capital. Scores of people have been killed and injured in weeks of rioting over economic inequality and social problems.  After Chile withdrew, there was concern that the annual talks might have to be scaled down, postponed or even abandoned. However, on Friday afternoon, the UN’s top official on climate change, Patricia Espinosa, issued a terse statement that COP25 would go ahead on the original dates, 2-13 December, but in Madrid. Scientific warnings have become increasingly insistent that time is running out to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and stave off the worst damages of global heating. But international negotiations under the UN have been slow and plagued by upsets and backsliding, such as the US plans to withdraw from the Paris agreement, Brazil’s rejection of its commitments by President Jair Bolsonaro, and the rise of political populism in other regions. Katherine Kramer, the global climate lead at Christian Aid, said: “It’s a shame that COP25 won’t be held in Latin America to highlight some of the grave climate impacts that affect the region. But hopefully a Madrid summit will be able to keep those in mind. Credit should be given to the Spanish government for offering to help at such short notice … but it shows how important countries view the UN process for tackling climate change that they are prepared to do all they can to keep the talks on track.” Tasneem Essop, the interim executive director of the Climate Action Network, made up of many NGOs with an interest in the issue, said: “We hope all steps are going to be taken … to make access to this COP fair and inclusive. It is important that there is the full participation of climate activists and observers from different parts of the world to COP25 where important negotiations on the Paris agreement are due to be undertaken.” Some activists who had set sail for Chile from Europe were planning to continue their journey. Others, particularly those from smaller organisations and delegations from poor countries, were likely to find it hard to meet the costs of the venue change. Greta Thunberg, the Swedish climate activist who sparked the global student strikes, had travelled as far as Los Angeles without flying and was planning to continue to Santiago in time for the conference. On Friday she made a plea for help getting back to Europe in time for the conference. “It turns out I’ve travelled half around the world, the wrong way,” she tweeted. “Now I need to find a way to cross the Atlantic in November … If anyone could help me find transport I would be so grateful.” This year’s talks are essential to putting the 2015 Paris agreement into practice and to pave the way for a crunch conference in the UK next year at which the long-term response to the climate emergency will be decided. Many of the world’s national commitments to cut greenhouse gases are pegged to a 2020 deadline, and if new commitments are to be set then next year will be crucial."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe purpose of the House Climate Change Hearing is to shed light on the question of: How much is man contributing to climate change, and how responsible is Obama’s energy policy?
So far the skeptics feel that the hearing has been successful in communicating their case to the public. The office of Rep. David McKinley P.E. (photo right) has distributed his remarks and graphics on the subject:
– CO2 is undeniably increasing.
– Some scientists and climatologists say their energy models reflect that CO2 levels coincide with temperature increases.
– But here’s a chart with 73 models and actual observations:

Not a single climate model has been correct so far. Warming has been minor. 
– Temperatures have been at a virtual standstill for the past 40 years while CO2 levels have increased.
– In fact Arctic sea ice has grown 60% despite increased CO2 levels.
– And if that was not enough, the ice surrounding Antarctica is also expanding.
– The United Nations’ reports also indicates that “most experts believe that by 2083, the benefits of climate change may still outweigh the harm.”

Chart provided by the office of DAVID B. MCKINLEY, P.E.
McKinley adds “that even if the U.S. stopped all its coal-fired power plants, CO2 levels would be reduced by merely two tenths of one percent globally” and that “the Obama Administration fails to tell the American people that 96% of emitted annually occurs naturally“. Also Obama does not tell us that its proposed regulations “would cast hundreds of thousands of workers out of work” while doing nothing noticeable for the environment.

Rep. McKinley also says “the rest of the world is not listening to the President’s energy policy” and that “China, India, Russia and Europe are all expanding their use of coal“.
Ensuring affordable energy to the poor is a moral imperative
Worse, McKinley points out that Obama’s proposed policy will hurt the poorest and most vulnerable on the planet:
Nations struggling to come out of poverty will continue to suffer, lives will be lost and children will be sick and perish as a result of the President’s support on this policy.”
McKinley adds that “one of the biggest moral responsibilities for the United States should be help emerging nations out of poverty” and that this can be done using “the most abundant and affordable source of power: coal“. Access to affordable energy is absolutely essential.
McKinley asks citizens:
Please take this message back to your agencies: This President must not prevent people around the globe from obtaining affordable, dependable energy; and threatening American workers and businesses with the loss of affordable energy from coal and natural gas is not an acceptable energy policy. Crushing America’s economy to reduce CO2 by 0.2% is an abuse of this Administration’s authority.”

"Victoria police have defended the actions of their officers over two days of protests at a mining conference in Melbourne, after one protester was hospitalised and reporters covering the event were pushed by police and pepper-sprayed. A dozen climate change protesters have been arrested on day two of action outside a global mining conference in Melbourne, where activists glued themselves to the ground. Officers used capsicum spray to break up the blockade on Wednesday, which was designed to prevent conference delegates entering the Convention and Exhibition Centre. It led to 12 activists being arrested, the majority for intentionally obstructing an emergency services worker, as they blocked access including via disabled ramps. Two people who glued themselves to a carpark access ramp have since been removed while another woman who “locked on” to a handrail has come unstuck, police said. “Whilst we respect the rights of people to peacefully protest, the unlawful action undertaken today is a drain on police resources from across greater Melbourne,” a police statement reads, adding all actions taken by officers were in line with training. An unnamed protester said she’d been told to move back before police “went wild”. “My friend got arrested, I got pepper-sprayed, it was crazy,” she told 3AW. Channel 7 journalist Paul Dowsley tweeted he was “stunned” after video of him being pushed by police was tweeted by Australian journalist Tessa Akerman. Dowsley said he was ““obeying [police] direction to move to another area” at the time of the incident. Incredible. I was obeying their direction to move to another area. I’m stunned. https://t.co/YsZDIjc9jO Police contradicted the journalist’s version of events in a statement: “It is unfortunate that members of the public, including journalists, are not following instructions by members of Victoria police. “In this case, the reporter involved did not follow police instructions to move away from the area. This was a safety issue and Victoria Police believes an appropriate amount of force was used to move the reporter from the area.” Student journalist at Farrago, Ailish Hallinan, also tweeted she had been pepper sprayed by police during the protests, despite not being involved in the blockade. Today I was reporting on #IMARC for @FarragoMagazine. I was not involved in the blockade, just a student journalist peacefully observing. Yet I was still pepper sprayed by police. This police brutality MUST end. @VictoriaPolice pic.twitter.com/CAwufSQGyJ The premier, Daniel Andrews, has backed police efforts to bring order to the protest.

But there is a big difference between peaceful protest and what we saw yesterday and potentially today,” he said during question time in parliament. It comes after hundreds of police and protesters clashed on Tuesday outside the conference, with four officers injured and a protester hospitalised with leg injuries. Almost 50 people were arrested on Tuesday and police continue to dedicate hundreds of officers to the protest as the conference continues until Thursday. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Victorian opposition leader, Michael O’Brien, backed the police who he said were “trying to make sure that these ferals can’t stop people going about their lawful business in this state”. Organisers of the International Mining and Resources Conference (Imarc) insist it was “business as usual” inside the centre and protests had failed to disrupt the meeting, which was due to attract some 7,000 delegates from more than 100 countries. The resources minister, Matt Canavan, told the conference attendees to ignore the protests outside. “Don’t give an inch to the protesters outside on these points. I am happy for the Australian resources industry to take the Pepsi morality challenge against other businesses any day of the week.” Delegates heard about commitments within the industry to prioritise ethical sourcing and meet climate change goals, organisers said, having accused protesters of being misdirected in targeting the conference."
"Will our grandchildren look back, 50 years from now, at a time when human beings ate other animals as one in which their grandparents were “complicit in a bloodbath of unnecessary suffering”, a horror show of unremitting violence that is “wholly unimaginable” to them? That’s the intriguing premise of Carnage, a new feature-length BBC film which depicts a 2067 utopia where humans no longer raise animals for consumption. Carnage is a mockumentary, written and directed by comedian Simon Amstell, but let’s contemplate its premise seriously for a moment. Is a “post-meat” world possible? Could we manage a transition to a society where farmed animals are liberated and granted equal status, free to live equally among humans?  There are some good reasons why this is an unlikely vision of the future. For a start, the number of animals slaughtered globally is on the increase. Although this includes hunting, poaching, and unwanted pets, by far the biggest point of interaction between humans and other animals is industrial farming. The statistics are staggering: at least 55 billion animals are killed by the global farming industry each year, and this figure is growing every year. Despite marketing tales of animal welfare and “happy meat”, factory farming means violence, discomfort and suffering on an enormous scale. This is why Yuval Noah Harari, the author of Sapiens, a history of the human race, calls our treatment of domesticated animals in industrial farms “perhaps the worst crime in history”. If we turn to consumers’ willingness to eat meat, psychological research in this area appears to cast further doubt on the utopian vision of Carnage. Most people who eat meat express concern in relation to animal welfare, and experience unease when the death or discomfort of animals is associated with the meat on their plate.  Psychologists refer to this tension between beliefs and behaviour as “cognitive dissonance”. We want to reduce the discomfort of such dissonance, but human nature means we often seek the easiest ways of doing so. So rather than changing behaviour, we change our thinking, and develop strategies like minimising the harm of the offending behaviour (animals don’t have the capacity to suffer like we do; they do not matter; they have a good life); or denying one’s responsibility for it (I am doing what everyone does; it is necessary; I was made to eat meat – it is natural). Dissonance-reduction strategies often lead, paradoxically, to an increase in commitment to “morally troublesome behaviour” such as eating meat, to justify them. We then have to work harder to reduce dissonance, creating the need to defend one’s behaviour even more vigorously. This commitment becomes habitual, and part of our shared routines, traditions and social norms. It’s a circular process that can end up with exaggerated and socially-polarised views, reflected perhaps in familiar attempts to publicly ridicule veganism. On this reading of the psychology research, change on the scale envisioned by Carnage seems unlikely. There are grounds for optimism, however. A first challenge comes from growing health concerns related to eating meat, and an accompanying lifestyle movement that embraces a “plant-based diet”. Meat substitutes are also becoming increasingly sophisticated, as the tech industry recognises the potential market value of alternative protein sources.  This is matched by a resurgent concern for the welfare of nonhuman animals more generally. Examples include successful campaigns against captive orca whales and circus animals, the widespread questioning of the purpose of zoos, and a burgeoning legal movement defending the rights of animals in court. This trend is strengthened by growing recognition of the emotional, cognitive and social complexity of nonhuman animals. What might be the biggest factor of all, however, is the impact on the climate. Meat is an inefficient use of resources (as farm animals eat food that could go straight to humans), while cows famously fart out lots of methane. The UN says the large-scale industrial farming of animals is one of “the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global”. A global reduction in meat consumption is one of the best ways to fight climate change. And, as pressure for resources rise, so too might cost, leading to less meat eating. Taken in isolation, none of these trends suggests social change on the scale Carnage imagines. But together, they just might. It is a combination that could explain significant growth in the number of vegetarians and vegans for example. This increase is especially marked among younger people – an important point to consider in relation to our imagined 50-year trajectory. And let’s face it, the need to do anything we can to collectively reduce carbon emissions and alleviate the worst effects of climate change is only going to become more pressing as we approach 2067. The German government seems to have recognised this, recently banning meat from all official functions for environmental reasons. These trends suggest the interlocking psychological, social and cultural dynamics that keep us habitually and routinely eating meat might be beginning to loosen. Films like Carnage also contribute to this unravelling, opening up our imagination to alternative futures. If you watch it, I hope it raises a few laughs, but also offers some (plant-based) food for thought."
"When it comes to reducing carbon emissions, one of the biggest hurdles is the world’s addiction to flying. And this is only going to get more intense as developing countries grow bigger middle classes who want to explore the world for business and pleasure. In the UK, the climate change minister, Nick Hurd, has named transport as one of the two biggest environmental challenges. But while the government continues to invest in research and infrastructure for electric vehicles, clear action on addressing carbon dioxide for air transport has been lacking. Our researchin collaboration with Manchester Metropolitan University and Missouri University of Science and Technology has shown that greener aviation fuels could cut not only carbon emissions but also reduce wider air pollution and improve air quality – a key issue in the ongoing debate around Heathrow’s proposed expansion. The landmark 2015 Paris Agreement on addressing climate change did not include two sectors – aviation and maritime. This is despite aviation accounting for 2% of global carbon dioxide emissions. This figure is growing by around 3% a year. Attempts to decarbonise the aviation sector have been complicated.  The process has been delayed by governments trying to agree on how to account for emissions – if a Dutch airline takes off in America and lands in Brazil, which country should take the responsibility for those emissions? The good news is that, in the autumn of 2016, the world’s governments came together under the UN’s specialist agency for aviation, the ICAO and finally reached an agreement. But this agreement is still voluntary and allows airlines to “offset” their carbon emissions.  Beyond this, the industry has set itself a targetto achieve carbon-neutral growth by 2020 and to halve emissions by 2050 compared to 2005 levels. This ambition can only be achieved by a combination of efforts including improvements in engine and airframes, such as new materials to make aircraft lighter, a more emissions-optimised approach to air traffic management and, crucially, by introducing greener alternatives to jet fuel. These alternative aviation fuels could offer the UK airline industry between 15% and 24% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2050. The UK government is starting to take action, including issuing a consultation on whether to increase the obligation it puts on airlines to increase the level of so-called “renewable fuel” used currently. Running in parallel with this has been a consultation on the future growth of Heathrow airport – and, even in this, alternative fuels could play a part both in terms of lower CO2 emissions if alternative fuel use is increase, and because these fuels contain fewer particulates than conventional fuels.   Our research has shown that particulates from air travel could be reduced by up to 60% by using synthetically produced fuels from feedstocks such as old cooking oil. In simple terms, the oil-baring feedstock can be heated with a catalyst to change its structure and extract the useful chemicals to form a type of fuel that can be used to power jet aircraft. There are, of course, challenges which need to be overcome if the role of alternative aviation fuels in tackling climate change and air pollution is to be realised. Aviation fuel has not changed substantially since the 1960s. The focus of  improvements in the efficiency of engines and airframes has been on the continued improvements to technology to the point where we have a highly optimised system based on the use of traditional fuels. If the industry adopted fuels developed from non-conventional sources such as bio-crops this may, in turn, make it possible for the indsutry to make further improvements in engine and airframe technologies based on new fuels. There are three major challenges facing the industry. Safety: This is the most obvious problem to overcome. The approval process for new fuels is extremely rigorous – airlines will not use fuels unless they know they are completely safe and will not affect the operation and reliability of the aircraft. This process can take several years to complete. To date, only a handful of alternative production routes have been approvedand the sector’s experience of dealing with new molecules in the jet fuel is increasing. Better modelling and earlier testing of fuels should help reduce the time, and cost, of this approvals process and efforts such as the US FAA and the ASCENT programme which aim to accelerate the approvals process in the future. Economics: The technology for producing alternative aviation fuels is still relatively immature and at a small scale which means that the cost remains higher than for fuel from conventional sources. Further research and development – and increasing the scale of production – will address these issues, as will the introduction of regulations which reward and incentivise airlines to use these fuels. Sustainability: We need to ensure that the production of alternative fuels works for the environment and people in the regions where these are produced. So, for example, in the case of biofuels, these shouldn’t compete for land with vital food crops. The use of municipal waste or offgases from industrial processes are two alternatives which do not compete with land use are gaining some traction as alternative fuels. This is an issue that will only get more urgent as more people in developing economies choose to travel by air. We’ve already made a good start – since 2011, more than 2,200 commercial flights have used alternative fuels– but this has to be put in a context of more than 100,000 flights being made worldwide each day.  While the current agreement is voluntary, ICAO has managed to create one of the first global agreements to apply to a specific sector on carbon emissions. Industry and academia now need to deliver the advancements – supported, needless to say, by national governments. That will be crucial if we are to see greener skies overhead any time soon."
"Rex Tillerson, the former chief executive of ExxonMobil and former secretary of state in the Trump administration, has denied in court that the oil and gas giant committed fraud by concealing from investors the true financial impact of the climate crisis. Tillerson told the New York supreme court that Exxon had acted properly over disclosing its financial exposure to climate-related regulations while he was chief executive.  Leticia James, the New York state attorney general, is suing Exxon over claims it misled investors over the costs associated with the climate crisis. Exxon is accused of misleading investors over the business risks caused by regulations to address the climate crisis. The company is accused of covering up the costs it will incur from government rules designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The case represents just the second time a climate case has gone to trial in the US. Exxon has long been a target for environmentalists, not only for being a major contributor to the climate crisis but also over revelations that it knew for decades that burning oil and gas would dangerously heat the planet. New York’s lawsuit accuses Exxon of using a public “proxy cost” of up to $80 per ton of carbon emissions to account for regulations that would limit planet-warming emissions, while internally using figures of $40 a ton, or nothing at all, to allow it to make more environmentally damaging investments. An Exxon spokesman has previously said that it properly applies two different metrics – a “proxy cost”, intended to reflect the impact of all climate policies on global demand, and a greenhouse gas cost which relates to actual levies placed on fossil fuel projects in a certain jurisdiction. Under questioning, Tillerson said: “We don’t know how else to model what future policy impacts might be. But whatever policies are, ultimately they come back to either your revenues or your costs.” The former Exxon head, who served as US secretary of state in Donald Trump’s government for just over a year before being fired in March 2018, added: “If you go back to the history of this, this was all fairly new.” Tillerson said he did not remember the climate costs being a determining factor in any decision made during his decade-long tenure at the helm of Exxon, which ended in 2016. James’s office has sought to cast Tillerson as a central figure in the securities fraud case, with Kevin Wallace, acting head of the attorney general’s investor protection bureau, telling the court last week that the former chief executive was “deeply involved” in working out the impact of climate science upon Exxon’s business prospects. On Wednesday morning, Tillerson said several times that he did not recall email conversations with colleagues on the cost of carbon. During his time at Exxon, Tillerson used an email alias, calling himself “Wayne Tracker”. Tillerson did, however, say that he supports the Paris climate agreement, which Trump announced during Tillerson’s tenure as secretary of state that the US planned to withdraw from, and that he favoured a price on carbon emissions. Exxon has denied any wrongdoing over its pricing of carbon and accused the lawsuit of being politically motivated. The case is among the most high profile of around a dozen rather different lawsuits launched by jurisdictions across the US that are attempting to claim compensation from fossil fuel companies for the damage caused by rising sea levels, storms, heatwaves and other impacts stemming from the climate crisis. “The attention this case received certainly places a harsh light on Exxon which must make them uncomfortable,” said Michael Gerrard, an expert in climate law at Columbia University. “They tried for years to stop this case from happening. This is all at least as much about reputation as it is about money.” Climate activists staged protests at the start of the Exxon trial and have kept up their criticism of the company since then. “Rex Tillerson is a climate criminal,” said Dominique Thomas, north-east regional organizer of climate group 350.org. “Yesterday was the seventh anniversary of Superstorm Sandy; a grave reminder that the lies of people like Rex Tillerson cause that kind of climate destruction.”"
"High-profile disasters such as Chernobyl and Fukushima have given nuclear power a bad name. Despite 60 years of nuclear generation without major accidents in many countries including Britain and France, many people have serious concerns about the safety of nuclear energy and the impact of the radioactive waste it generates. The very high capital cost of building a plant is also seen as a significant barrier, particularly given recent low oil prices. Plans to build a new British plant at Hinkley Point in Somerset are facing fresh opposition after it emerged the estimated lifetime costs had risen to £37 billion. Yet the high priority of reducing carbon emissions thanks to climate change means nuclear power looks more important than ever. Luckily, the next generation of reactors could hold the answer. With more in-built safety systems and a way to reuse old fuel, they are set to make nuclear power safer and, potentially, cheaper. Human error and a natural disaster played major roles in the Chernobyl and Fukushima incidents, respectively. But in both cases, the failures occurred when the plants could no longer keep the reactors cool enough. At Chernobyl this was because of deliberate action and human error, and at Fukushima because the backup generators to drive the cooling pumps had been destroyed as a result of the tsunami. An important reason why nuclear power is so expensive is the complex engineering, exacting standards, and advanced manufacturing technology that is used to ensure safe operation. For example, plants usually sits on a “nuclear island” of reinforced concrete that acts as a stable base for the plant and provides a barrier of last resort in case radioactive material is released. The pressure vessel at the core of the plant is made from carefully alloyed and fabricated steel to prevent it from becoming brittle from the decades’ worth of radiation it has to endure.  Today’s reactor designs also have far more safety features than older installations. These range from duplicate emergency cooling systems to prevent overheating even if some systems fail, through to so-called “core catchers” that would contain the reactor core in a worst-case meltdown event. Some designs will cool passively in the event of a loss of power to the cooling circuit (as happened at Fukushima). The heat from the core will gradually dissipate from the walls of the pressure vessel and through the cooling circuit by convection. The reactors that are being constructed today benefit from 60 years of experience gained in the design and operation of nuclear power plants around the world. But future reactor technologies –- so-called “Gen IV” designs – offer even better inherent safety. One of their key features are fully passive cooling systems so the reactor is never dependent on external power for safety. The reactor is carefully designed so that overheating actually reduces, rather than increases, the power output of the core. The core and cooling systems are not pressurised, and using liquids other than water for cooling prevents the risk of creating hydrogen: both of which drastically reduce the risk of explosions as occurred at Fukushima. Gen IV reactors will also allow more efficient use of nuclear fuel. The fuel in current reactor designs is used only once and then disposed of, which produces radioactive waste that will take hundreds of millennia to decay to a safe level. But this waste contains valuable resources of fissile material that can be reprocessed into new fuel. Burning this fuel in specialised “fast” reactors provides would be much more efficient and generate waste that decays safely within just a hundred years or so. It would also move us towards a closed fuel-cycle that would greatly extend the lifetime of the Earth’s uranium reserves. Another of the factors that makes nuclear power plants so expensive is that we haven’t built very many in recent years. This means that there is no industrial supply chain of companies with the expertise to manufacture the technology, reducing competition and limiting economies of scale. For the few plants that have been built, there have often been issues in construction quality as the project has progressed: with the concrete for the nuclear island, the welding of heat exchanger pipework, or the composition of the steel used for the pressure vessel. These have needed expensive fixes or investigation to assure regulators that safety hasn’t been compromised. So one way to reduce the costs of nuclear power plant is simply to build more of them. There are economies of scale in terms of having identical designs with the same requirements for construction, fuelling, operation and maintenance. In the UK in particular, attention is shifting towards so-called small modular reactors, or SMRs, that produce less power but that have lower upfront capital construction costs. Perhaps if the latest technology can also convince the public nuclear power has become safer, there will be the appetite to build enough plants to bring the costs down even more."

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt seems every time Stefan Rahmstorf makes a claim about climate, there’s almost always something very creative and acrobatic about the statistical approach he uses on which to base that claim. Rahmstorf seems to feel very much at home with the climate-Armageddon-theorists at his ultra-alarmist Potsdam Institute.
===========================================
By Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated, edited by P Gosselin)
Wringing his hands, Potsdam Climate Impact research Institute’s Stefan Rahmstorf keeps up his efforts to pour cold water on the warming pause. In an article at his Klimalounge blog on November 1, 2013 he posted a chart depicting the September temperatures over the last 130 years, represented by a bold red-colored moving average curve that shows no pause in warming (Figure 1). Rahmstorf has always said: The warming continues unabated.

Figure 1: Global September temperature for the last 130 years. Source: Klimalounge / Stefan Rahmstorf.
But wait, upon closer examination, September temperatures do show a plateau that is already more than 10 years long.
Weather Central Forum contributor DH7FB has taken a close look at the data and discovered where Rahmstorf used tricks to get warmer results. First with curve smoothing, if an especially long smoothing interval is used, then the plateau at the end disappears. Here Rahmstorf uses an enormously long period of more than 30 years without mentioning it in his blog. If one uses a smoothing period that is more common, say 5 years, then the warming pause becomes clearly visible also for September temperatures.

Using 5-year smoothing: light blue curve = September; bold blue mean = June, July, September, bold red = July-December. Source: wzforum.de/forum2/msg-2768981.
And why did Rahmstorf choose September and not some other month? DH7FB made a comparison with other monthly combinations and discovered that the Pinatubo-eruption in June 1991 had a significant impact on September and that it significantly steepened the global September mean value curve.
Reading tip: Take a look at the reader comments at Rahmstorf’s blog. It’s peppered with criticism.
==================================
It should be noted that in his blog article and comments, Rahmstorf repeatedly equates climate skeptics to the Tea Party, “the radical climate skeptical wing of the Republicans” and that “climate skeptic think tanks are financed mainly by the Koch brothers”.

New update: nofrakkingconsensus.com/look-again/
Greenpeace tweet from 17 September: “…we’ve got 4 boats in the water heading towards Gazprom’s Arctic rig. We’re going to try and stop the drilling.”
========================================
Online Spiegel today has an analysis by Benjamin Bidder and Christoph Seidler on the motives behind the detention of the 30 Greenpeace activists who tried to storm a Gazprom platform in September and the role of Russian politics. According to Spiegel, the story here is one of Russian energy behemoth Gazprom taking revenge on Europe for raids the EU had conducted on Gazprom European offices in 2011.
Spiegel reminds readers that Greenpeace was actually very much admired by Vladimir Putin, and that the environmentalist group until recently “enjoyed cover from the Kremlin“. Last year Greenpeace had even carried out a similar platform-climbing action in the Russian Arctic and had even used its strong connections to the Kremlin to facilitate the publicity-grabbing stunt. The stunt of 2012 was even led by Greenpeace director Kumi Naidoo himself (this year he stayed away). Spiegel also describes a number of special privileges Greenpeace seemed to enjoy with Putin’s government. Greenpeace seemed to have the Kremlin’s blessings.
But obviously something has gone terribly awry in the relations between Greenpeace, European environmentalism, and Russia. As the Greenpeace controversy sizzles, Putin is nowhere to be found on the issue and seems to have delegated the matter entirely to Russia’s justice authorities. Spiegel writes that the tone now appears to be one set by hardliners such as Alexander Prochanov, “one of the ideologues of Putin’s new, nationalistic course” who, according to Spiegel, openly said that they “regret not having blasted the dogs into the sky so that not a trace remains“. Another Russian politician accuses Greenpeace of “environmental extortion“.
So what happened?
Greenpeace claims that it all happened without warning. Spiegel writes that this year the FSB Russian special forces were waiting for the activists and were perfectly happy to watch them “impale themselves on an open knife“. Spiegel writes that according to Moscow-based CPI think-tank director Alexei Muchin, “Putin had nothing to do with it“. But for Gazprom, the “last bit of patience had been exhausted. The company not only wanted to send a message to Greenpeace, ‘but also to the European Union.’ The Commission among other actions had ordered raids of Gazprom offices“.
According to that linked Spiegel article from October 2011, with the Gazprom raids the EU wanted “to break Gazprom’s monopoly“, which was shown “by correspondence and documentation confiscated in an investigation within the scope of the raid from last Tuesday.”

One could speculate that this all seems to point to a very cunning trap set up by Moscow, whereby the Russians pretended to be still best of friends with Greenpeace even after the October, 2011 raid of Gazprom offices in Europe. This false charm in turn emboldened Greenpeace to believe they could get way with anything, even with protest activities in Russia. Finally, last month, Greenpeace activists ran straight into the trap and into FSB handcuffs.
This is all a very messy situation for Europe – and just how the Russians like it. For example Germany’s former socialist chancellor Gerhard Schroder sits on the board of a major Gazprom project, acting as one of the key facilitators who made the construction of the North European Gas Pipeline from Russia to Germany possible. Schroder, a close pal of Putin, was Germany’s chancellor from 1998 to 2005 in a coalition government with the German Green party. Does anyone expect Schroder to lift a finger against Gazprom? Moscow surely has that base covered to insure he never does, and one gets the sense that the Russians are at least a dozen moves ahead of Europe in this complex, multi-dimensional chess game.
What’s more, Spiegel adds that today Gazprom is very closely tied to the FSB, “The son of ex secret service director Nikolai Patruschev is Vice President of Gazprom Dobytscha Schelf, a subsidiary company for offshore production.” For the time being, Europe appears hopelessly outmatched in its chess game against Russia. They need to find a Bobby Fischer quickly.
In its latest move the EU now views the seizure of the Arctic Sunrise as a “hostile act“. Spiegel writes:
The ‘Arctic Sunrise’ is sailing under the Dutch flag and the government in Den Haag is losing patience.”
Dutch Foreign Minster Frans Timmermans has had his staff write a letter of complaint for the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea in Hamburg, claiming that the storming of the Arctic Sunrise “was illegal” and that “the crew should be free until the matter is checked for human rights“. Spiegel adds:
We are giving the Russians time until Monday, says the Ministry. Then we will contact the judges in Hamburg. ‘We will be prepared.'”

"Without nature, humans could be neither healthy nor happy. And yet the natural world can be completely ransacked without causing even a tiny blip on our usual measures of economic progress or poverty. A major UN environmental meeting recently looked at launching an assessment of the different values that people attribute to nature, and what nature contributes to human societies. However, these high level discussions will be futile unless our measures of societal progress expand to explicitly include what nature does for human well-being and prosperity, especially for poor people. Nature matters to people’s well-being in many different ways. It obviously provides us with basic needs such as food, clean air and water, as well as protection from environmental hazards. There is also a clear relationship with both physical and mental well-being, especially for those who are fortunate enough to have access to green spaces. Beyond these instrumental roles, there is also evidence from around the world that nature is a more fundamental contributor to people’s sense of self. It is an integral part of what constitutes well-being, captured for some in the awe-inspiring moments when standing on top of a mountain, the breath-taking view of a beautiful river, or in the feeling of freedom associated with traversing a wide open landscape.  Despite the value we get from nature, our measures of progress and well-being remain much narrower, focused on what is visible and measurable. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has been the most prominent approach since the end of World War II, with GDP seen as a useful snapshot of the state of the economy and people’s well-being. What these figures often hide are those things, like the role of nature, that are not measured in the monetary economy, but are an important part of daily life and can be crucial for sustaining future prosperity.  There are alternatives. One that has gained some momentum is the Inclusive Wealth Index, which takes into account broader measures of human and natural well-being – its most recent assessment suggested that conventional GDP figures had greatly exaggerated growth over the period 1992-2010. In international development, the UN’s Human Development Index and the “multidimensional poverty index” both recognise a larger set of issues, combining material standards with measures of health and education. But they still do not adequately incorporate the role of nature. Ignoring nature creates some perverse paradoxes. Measured GDP might actually increase as a consequence of a major environmental disaster, because of the economic activity created by the clean up and repair. Meanwhile, the environmental losses themselves don’t show up in economic measures. A country could get rich by cutting down all its primary forests (and many have), but the associated loss of habitat and wild species would not feature in national accounts. Governments continue to make decisions based on a key set of headline figures. These include GDP and per capita income, which reflect economic prosperity, and, in poorer countries, the extent and incidence of poverty. But we can do better: our ongoing research focuses on developing environmentally-adjusted measures of multidimensional poverty, based on the insight that people are typically poorer when they do not have access to nature.  Our research suggests that failing to consider these missing environmental aspects can result in an incomplete assessment of the multiple dimensions and underlying drivers of poverty. Consequently, the identification of the poor, as well as an understanding of what makes them poor, risks being partial, thereby posing a challenge to addressing poverty adequately. The current status quo fails people, especially the poor, and also threatens future prosperity by undervaluing nature. Those who benefit from the current approaches are typically global elites who profit from environmental destruction (which goes unrecognised).  The losers are those most dependent on nature for their livelihoods and those especially vulnerable to environmental change. Even if nature is valued, it is typically converted into money equivalents, which favours those who are able and willing to parcel out nature into small commoditised bundles, which can then be sold to the highest bidder. This fails to take into account the views of those who believe that nature matters in other ways or in its own right, who care about the beauty of nature and the sheer joy that it provides to many. The consequences of neglecting people’s varied views and aspirations have become apparent from recent political events in Europe and the US. Nature matters to our well-being, and people see their relationship with nature in many different ways. Recognising this is a crucial step towards building a more inclusive, equitable and sustainable society."
"A climate protester has been taken to hospital and more than 20 others have been arrested while blockading an international mining conference in Melbourne after violent clashes erupted between the group and police. From 6am on Tuesday, hundreds of activists from a dozen different groups began blocking entry to the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre. They faced off against police officers, who say they had been forced to arrest “in excess of 20 protesters” who were blocking the disabled and wheelchair access to the building and refusing to move on. Two people were also arrested for assaulting a police horse. “Police continue to arrest protesters blocking access to the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre,” a spokeswoman said. “Exact arrest numbers will be provided when we have them.” One police officer received minor injuries during the arrests and was treated at the scene before being taken to hospital. A protester was also taken to hospital in a stable condition after she was injured by a police horse. Callum, a protester who did not want to give his surname, said police were being “extremely violent” towards the group. “They’ve used batons and are being aggressive,” he said. “The horses shouldn’t be here as they get extremely nervous and have hurt a woman.” Other protesters have accused police of being aggressive, placing one man in a headlock and pushing another to the floor, as well as using capsicum spray. “I think the police have been incredibly hostile … I’m quite shocked by how aggressive they’ve been,” a protest organiser, Emma Black told 3AW radio. The International Mining and Resources Conference is Australia’s largest annual industry event and attracts delegates from the resources, investing and technology sectors. More than 7,000 people from nearly 100 countries are expected to attend the three-day event. Among them is Craig Ian McGown, chairman at Pioneer Resources, who said a bottle of water had been emptied over him and he had been pushed and forced to walk 40 metres with a woman next to him shouting “shame”. “I’m just very confused by people having too much time off,” he said. “I’m just in attendance at the conference because my company is involved in major projects that can help the country move forward.” Conference organisers say the protest action is based on misconceptions about the mining industry. This year the the event will consider the importance of battery minerals, used in the emerging electric car market, and the growing importance of ethical investment for resource companies. Protesters plan to disrupt all three days of the conference and will be joined by the Victorian Greens leader, Samantha Ratnam, on Tuesday and the federal Greens MP, Adam Bandt, on Wednesday. Despite initial concerns about traffic disruptions, VicRoads said traffic was flowing through nearby streets and trams were running. The deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, described the protests as “disgraceful, absolutely disgraceful”."
"Chile’s embattled president has been forced to cancel two major international summits after government concessions failed to defuse weeks of violent protests that have seen thousands of arrests, left at least 20 dead and sent shock waves across Latin America. Sebastián Piñera made the announcement on Wednesday morning, telling reporters Chile would no longer be able to host November’s Apec trade summit and the COP25 UN climate conference the following month. World leaders including Donald Trump and China’s leader, Xi Jinping, had been due to attend the first event while climate champions including the teenage activist Greta Thunberg were expected at the second. Piñera blamed the “difficult circumstances” Chile was facing for the decision and said his government’s primary concern had to be “fully restoring public order, security and social peace”. “This has been a very difficult decision – which has caused us great pain – because we understand perfectly the importance [of the events] for Chile and for the world,” Chile’s centre-right president said. “When a father has problems, he must always put his family before everything else. Similarly, a president must always put his own countrymen ahead of any other consideration,” Piñera added. Patricia Espinosa, the UN’s climate change executive secretary, said the UN was “exploring alternative hosting options” for the climate summit after being informed of the decision in a letter from Chile’s environment minister. Piñera said he had warned other world leaders of the cancellation. Chile’s protests began in mid-October as a student-led fight  against a 3.7% hike in metro fares. But those demonstrations quickly swelled into a much broader mutiny against inequality, the cost of living and police repression. According to Chile’s Human Rights Institute, 3,535 people have been arrested since 17 October while 1,132 people have been taken to hospital – 38 of them with gunshot injuries. On 18 October Piñera declared a state of emergency after violence broke out on the streets of the capital, Santiago, later declaring the country “at war” with “evil” delinquents. After such moves failed to quell the unrest, Chile’s president tried to placate protesters with a conciliatory televised address in which he asked forgiveness for the “shortsightedness” of the country’s political leaders. Piñera also unveiled a string of progressive economic reforms, a cabinet reshuffle and the decision to end nightly curfews in an effort to calm tensions. But those concessions appear not to have been enough. Daily street marches continue to call for Piñera’s resignation. Schools and offices are functioning sporadically. Lines at supermarkets have eased but little remains of the routine that just two weeks ago led Piñera to declare Chile an “oasis” in an increasingly volatile region. On Saturday an estimated 1 million people poured on to the streets of Santiago for a peaceful protest that was reputedly the country’s largest since the dying days of Gen Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorship in the late 1980s. “It is absolutely logical for no one to come. We’re in no shape to receive presidents at the moment. I support the decision,” said Marcia Ruiz, a 56-year-old protester who was outside La Moneda, Chile’s presidential palace, on Wednesday. “The president lost control of this on day one,” Ruiz added. “It’s sad.” The last-minute decision to cancel the UN summit is a blow to global efforts to tackle the climate emergency and will fuel fears that a vicious cycle is emerging in which divisions between and within countries make it impossible for states to act together to deal with the underlying causes of unrest. It is also the second setback for international climate talks in less than a year. Brazil had been due to host COP25 but pulled out last year after the presidential election victory of the far-right populist Jair Bolsonaro, who has pursued an anti-globalist agenda. A UK government spokesperson said: “We understand Chile’s decision to withdraw from hosting COP25. We will work closely with Chile and other important partners to help ensure that the crucial work due to be undertaken at COP25 is not affected. The UK government remains committed to bringing world leaders together to tackle climate change in Glasgow in 2020.” Miguel Crispi, a sociologist and founder of the Chilean political party Democratic Revolution, said: “The cancellation of #COP25 is very bad news. It was a great opportunity to debate the climate crisis. This means the government is assuming that they can’t guarantee public order from now until December – and that is also worrying.” Peter Hartmann, the director of CODEFF Aysen, an environmental group organizing to protect the wild ecosystems of Chilean Patagonia, said: “It’s a shame because the summit was an opportunity for Chile to be more coherent in their environmental outlook and to bring international attention to the environmental issues in Chile.” Many activists will now be cancelling flights and hotels in Santiago but several groups are already on their way. School climate strikers from Europe are in the middle of the Atlantic on their way to South America. “We just heard COP25 has been cancelled. We will have a meeting about this now on board, please keep us updated and any ideas are welcome. They can cancel the COP but can’t cancel the movement!” the group tweeted."
"Britain and Europe’s largest airport is not the most obvious target for an eco-friendly rebranding. Yet Heathrow Airport recently unveiled a new sustainability strategy, Heathrow 2.0, to counter growing opposition to its expansion plans. Both the government and an independent Airports Commission have backed proposals to construct a new third runway at London’s largest airport hub. But the plans remain highly contested, with ongoing concerns about noise pollution, air quality and rising carbon emissions. Heathrow expansion has become an emblematic issue in the fight against climate change. At first glance, it is tempting to dismiss the launch of Heathrow 2.0 as yet another attempt at greenwashing. Indeed, those in favour of the new runway have made sustained efforts to depoliticise the issue ever since the 2010-2015 coalition government declared its ambition to put the environment and local well-being ahead of Heathrow’s growth. An airport that exists above politics gives the illusion that no one has to choose between planes and pollution. In fact, the current plans to render its new runway carbon neutral echo the failed policy of “sustainable aviation” under the New Labour government. This strategy was quickly discredited by scientists and environmentalists, because of its “cake and eat it” narrative, in which we could fly more and still cope with rising carbon emissions. Nonetheless, such arguments pepper Heathrow’s new vision for corporate social responsibility. Much is made of the expected benefits of new technologies and innovations, the role of increased connectivity in creating jobs, the enjoyment we gain from the social benefits of flying, and the commitment to carbon offsetting schemes to address rising emissions. Heathrow 2.0 even aspires to “‘decouple’ aviation growth from climate change” – a key pillar of the ideology of sustainable aviation. Yet Heathrow’s strategy at least engages with the idea of sustainable development, through what it calls “responsibility”. It promises to improve its practices as an employer, committing to a London Living Wage, and it pledges to put an end to human and wildlife trafficking. It wants to produce a “zero-carbon airport” with reduced emissions and “polluter pays” policies. Heathrow 2.0 might even satisfy local demands for better noise protection. But it’s the detail that really matters. In important respects, the plans lack clarity and ambition. Strategic priorities like a “noise envelope” to cap the overall disturbance emanating from the airport are often stated, but not accompanied with clear targets. Similarly, it is questionable whether locals will be too enthusiastic about targets to reduce late running aircraft after 11.30pm from 330 in 2016 to 270 in 2017. Or whether they will welcome no arrivals before 4.30am without clarity over the agreement to ban night flights from 11pm to 6am. As Heathrow itself accepts, importantly, the airport cannot deliver on most of the claims it makes. Of course, a carbon neutral airport is a worthy ideal. But it is the flights themselves that cause most carbon emissions and account for much of the noise pollution, while traffic to and from the airport also creates air pollution. Heathrow cannot control or make guarantees about fixing any of this. Indeed, at the heart of these limits to Heathrow 2.0 is the failure of the May government. The airport is simply trying to fill the void left by Theresa May and transport secretary Chris Grayling, who have abandoned their responsibility to offer policy leadership in this field.  A recent Heathrow report by MPs on the Environmental Audit Committee criticised the government for its lax interpretation of air quality directives, its failure to address local health impacts, its overly ambitious targets for ultra-low emission vehicles, and its absence of detailed plans for road improvements and new rail access to the airport. The committee also criticised the government for watering down proposals for an independent aviation noise authority and for not being clear about how to bridge the gap between theoretical models to reduce emissions and actual policy. Most concerning is that this absence of leadership betrays the emergence of a new “post-sustainable” aviation, designed to accommodate the challenges of Brexit. Gone are the attempts by the previous government to put climate change before new airports. In their place, the vital justifications and mechanisms for an expansionist agenda are carefully being assembled.  The risk is that green concerns will be pushed further to the margins, as people are increasingly urged to believe that human progress and innovation are enough to meet environmental challenges. In this emerging discourse, the demands of economic growth trump those of the environment and social well-being."
"It seems miraculous that any butterflies can survive a month of rain, but as soon as the autumn sun emerges so do red admirals and the occasional painted lady, en route for the sunnier south. The 59 British species are perfectly adapted for our weather but adjusting to rapid climate change is more challenging, as two new studies led by scientists from the University of York show.  Relatively cool regions should gain more warmth-loving butterflies than they lose but many species are not moving north as widely or quickly as expected. One reason is some species are isolated on fragments of suitable habitat, unable to expand through a human-dominated landscape. Climate change has helped the versatile comma spread from Yorkshire to Aberdeen in two decades. But the silver-studded blue, which requires heathland or grassland, has been unable to move between these rare habitats and expand its range. Another reason is butterflies and moths are emerging in spring on average between one and six days earlier per decade. Flexible species with multiple breeding cycles, such as the speckled wood, benefit from “more” time. But single-generation specialists, such as the endangered high brown fritillary, are thrown out of sync with the plants they feed on. "

Share this...FacebookTwitterBritish politician, Nigel Lawson, former Chancellor of the Exchequer and Secretary of State for Energy, interviewed yesterday with the online Swiss daily Tagesanzeiger based in Zurich. He provides his views on climate change and energy policy.
Photo right: Nigel Lawson, public domain photo
A number of leading Swiss publications have recently expressed doubts over the claims made by the IPCC and its scientists. The Tagesanzeiger interview is just the latest.
First Lawson calls the IPCC’s admission that the global temperature hasn’t risen in 15 years “notable” and that it shows the climate models are “inadequate”. “The empirical findings contradict the claims about the future being made by the IPCC. That’s not the way to do science.”
(Note: All quotes are translated from the German).
Lawson does not dispute that CO2 has a warming impact on climate, but that the real question is: how much? “On this there are many different opinions“. Lawson believes that the IPCC agenda is mostly in the hands of alarmists who believe CO2 is mostly driving the climate. But Lawson says there has to be other factors. “Without a doubt, the most important one is solar activity.”
IPCC presents excuses and speculation
Lawson calls the assumption that the oceans have soaked up the heat “pure speculation, an excuse from alarmists who are searching for a reason to explain why they erred”. He says that there are no measurements from the deep sea to support this, and also dismisses the notion that CO2 may have caused the Gulf Stream to change, calling it “nonsense”.
On Svensmark’s cosmic ray theory, Lawson says that CERN has neither been able to confirm nor refute the theory, and that the theory remains interesting.
When asked about global warming causing more storms, Lawson is emphatic, saying this is not the case and points to greedy insurance companies.
It is completely false. The number and strength of tropical storms over the last decades has not increased, even if the insurance companies always claim to the contrary in order to justify their increasing premiums.”
On sea level rise, Lawson sees no data showing sea level rise is going to speed up and warns that this is fraught with uncertainty as it is a very complex phenomena involving the movement of land masses. (Story continues below)

====================================
Fossil fuels the most efficient
In the interview, it is also clear to Lawson that global warming does not entail only disadvantages, but also brings a number of advantages. He cites the fertilization effects on plant growth from higher Co2. He also points to mankind’s ability to adapt to changing climate conditions as being far better today than ever.
On the question of whether the world should wean itself off fossil fuels:
Countries like China and India should not do so under any circumstances because it would put their economic development in jeopardy. Fossil fuels are and will remain the most efficient.”
He adds that he thinks it’s possible that Europe will go it alone on renewable energy, and claims that its “competitiveness would suffer enormously. … Except for Europe, no one on the planet believes in the end of fossil fuels. Higher energy prices would by horrible, especially for the poor!”
No consensus
The Tagesanzeiger then asks why he thinks he knows better than the IPCC scientists. Here Lawson delivers a lethal blow to the notion of “consensus”, reminding the Tagesanzeiger that many scientists agree with his position, among them Freeman Dyson. He also reminds the Tagesanzeiger that many of the climate scientists are not from the field of climate, but from other fields. Lawson was also former energy minister, and so he thinks he understands energy far better than David Cameron or Al Gore. He accuses David Cameron of populism with the climate change issue and that Cameron fancies himself as a sort of planet rescuer. Lawson reminds us that also Margaret Thatcher also had emphatically rejected the alarmist theories.
On why climate alarmism and the calls to abolish CO2 are today still very much in vogue, Lawson concludes:
After the failure of communism, new arguments were needed in order to be able to discredit the market economy. Also the belief in man-made climate change to some extent involves religious tendencies.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe media today are raving over Angela Merkel’s “huge victory“, with some even calling it “historic” or even a “blowout”, as Drudge does.
But this isn’t so by any means. Merkel’s government LOST and will soon no longer be in power. The perception of media outlets from Great Britain and in the USA surely has been distorted by a dense fog across the English Channel and the Atlantic. Merkel’s government was defeated. Her current government failed to get the votes needed to continue.
Somewhere along the line Merkel forgot that her government was a team effort and involved other team players. Although her party scored lots of goals and made spectacular plays that wowed the viewers, her team lost. She is the MVP, but on the losing team.
Typical of Merkel: when the going gets tough, she abandons her partners, throws them under the bus, but not without first giving them a swift, hard kick to the face. Had Merkel’s CDU/CSU party received a scant half a percent of the vote less and her junior FDP a scant half a percent more, her government would be sitting firmly in power today. But no, Merkel and her players insisted on being stars and abandoned their team mates. This is going to come back around soon enough.
We saw the same pattern when she ditched Germany’s nuclear power in the wake of Fukushima, and later when she brutally threw Federal Environment Minister Norbert Röttgen under the bus after his disastrous CDU election defeat in North Rhine-Westphalia. Immediately Röttgen resigned his position as head of the CDU in North Rhine-Westphalia and on 16 May 2012 he was fired by Merkel and replaced by Peter Altmaier as the Federal Minister for Environment.
So in the aftermath of yesterday’s elections, what’s left is superstar Merkel on a defeated team searching for a new coalition partner. Now it’s her turn to beg.

Merkel’s CDU/CSU party only has two options: 1) form a coalition with rival socialist SPD party, or 2) try to forge a coalition with the hostile Greens.
Should the runner-up SPD party agree to form a coalition with Merkel’s CDU/CSU, then look for such a government that will try to force through the “Energiewende” (transition to renewables) with renewed vigor. Her previous liberal, business-friendly FDP party was the only element in German politics who to some extent applied the emergency brakes on the out of control renewable energy subsidies and feed-in tariffs. An SPD coalition partner will surely let up on the brakes, if not completely abandon them. A huge, almost two thirds majority CDU/SPD government would practically allow them to ram through any energy policy desired.
Should the Greens agree to form a coalition with Merkel’s party, a very unlikely scenario, but not one that can be excluded with the opportunistic Merkel, then the Energiewende gas pedal would surely get pushed to the metal.
With the FDP liberal coalition partner gone and licking its wounds, there is nothing left (except a fleeting chance to some rationality) in place to slow down the Energiewende and climate policy.
There is one other remaining possibility: both the Greens and SPD will refuse to form a coalition with Merkel’s conservatives. That would leave superstar Merkel without a team to lead, and wishing she had not thown the FDP under the wheels.

"Consumers are in an unprecedented dilemma over food. On the one hand, they have never had it so good. Supermarkets have spread worldwide and are awash with food. On the other hand the rate that over-consumption of food is growing globally is unsustainable – and its effect on the environment are already being felt. For the consumer, it’s a rosy picture – food expenditure as a percentage of total domestic spending has fallen since World War II and farm output has increased sufficiently to be able to feed growing populations, if only problems of distribution were sorted out.  This new food system is generally seen as a triumph of modernity and efficiency. It liberated consumer tastes – true, this was mostly first experienced by the urban mass market and in the West, but thanks to the internet and better communications, the luxury (and inclination) for people to eat what they want, and when they want it, is now present even in deepest rural areas and is spreading worldwide. It is no wonder that, almost everywhere, politicians are content to leave food matters to the mighty food industries – confident they will drive progress, lower costs and keep consumers happy. This has been the consumerist food deal of the past half century. It has been a great story, too, but is now leading consumers into a dark place. Consumers are literally being kept in the dark about much that modern science now knows about the food system and its impacts on our world. The edifice of the food economy is built on sand which is being eroded beneath our feet.  Food is either the major or one of the major drivers of climate change, water stress, land use, biodiversity loss, soil erosion, deforestation, the depletion of fish stocks. And that’s just where the food comes from. Turning away from the land and sea towards consumption, the diets people eat today are now the single biggest factor in premature death worldwide, and a key indicator of cultural change and social inequalities. Patterns of eating developed over centuries in tune with local climates are being turned upside down almost overnight by massive marketing and advertising which aims to get the consumer when young. The rise and spread of obesity now dwarfs malnutrition. The drive for cheap meats – nirvana for people for whom meat was expensive and a treat – has legitimised routine and profligate use of antibiotics in farm factories, to the point where the effectiveness of antibiotics is now threatened. This despite warnings it would happen, not least from Sir Alexander Fleming in his 1945 Nobel Prize acceptance speech for discovery of penicillin. For all the razzmatazz of food modernity, food is still low-wage work, and is the biggest employer on the planet. The UN estimates at least 1.3 bn people work the land, a third of them for no wages, in self-sufficiency. And across the food system of the rich world, food is a low-wage employer. In the UK, for instance, food retail, food service, farm work and food manufacturing, all pay below the national average.  The squeeze on profit margins is tight, particularly on farming. Government figures show British farmers add £8.5 billion of Gross Value Added (GVA) to the UK food chain, while the GVA for manufacturers is £26.9 billion, retailers £30.2 billion and caterers £29.1 billion. Consumers’ money is taken off the land, yet a fantasy is peddled that food comes from farmers. Among scientists, there is a remarkable consensus that the current policy direction cannot continue. These contradictions are unbearable – literally so, because if the world continues the trend to eat like the West, the burdens on ecosystems, healthcare systems and finance will be unsupportable. That, at least, is the uncomfortable conclusion one must draw, when one looks at the evidence. But since when has the politics of consumption been about evidence? The few studies conducted into consumers’ response to this big picture about unsustainable diets show that consumers become a little indignant when they find out. A careful study by Which? found consumers asking: why weren’t we told about this? They want to know more. Rightly so, but how, and from whom?   Hard-pressed teachers turn to commerce for fact sheets. Parents are too often in the dark, if truth be told. Nor could any food label convey the depth and scale of what consumers really need to know. Giant food companies have replaced schools and parents as sources of public “education”. They are the Nanny Corporations, replacing the fictitious Nanny State. They filter what people are to know. Coca-Cola’s annual marketing budget is US$4billion (£3.18 billion), twice the entire World Health Organisation annual budget in 2014-15, and much more than its budget for non-communicable diseases ($0.32 billion) or for promoting health through the life-course ($0.39 billion). How can this by unlocked? Consumers buying food too often without knowing the consequences. Politicians distancing themselves from this unfolding disaster. Workers and companies vying with each other to produce more for less. This is crazy ecological economics – self-defeating food culture. It piles up burdens on public health. It’s obvious really – a new politics of food has to unfold in which academics treat consumers with dignity and tell them the truth. Politics follows the public, not the other way round. So it’s the public which must be helped. The neoliberal rhetoric is of consumer sovereignty, yet everywhere they are kept in the dark."
"Labor leader Anthony Albanese has pledged to tackle skills shortages and industrial relations reform if he wins government, as he seeks to reposition the party’s proposed action on climate change as a new jobs “revolution”. In the first of a series of vision statements aimed at resetting Labor’s policy agenda following the May election, the opposition leader has outlined the party’s jobs and skills agenda in a speech in Perth on Tuesday. Saying the party is “proudly and resolutely pro-growth”, Albanese has flagged the potential of clean energy jobs for a new manufacturing boom, while also emphasising the need to do more on skills reform. Labor in government would establish a new national organisation called Jobs and Skills Australia, Albanese said, which would be tasked with driving improved outcomes in the vocational education and training sector and strengthening workplace planning. The agency would be legislated and based on the model of Infrastructure Australia, with its functions including workforce and skills analysis and reviewing the adequacy of the training and vocational education system. “It will work with business and unions to harness insights from industry to ensure that training is meeting not just today’s needs but to anticipate how work is changing,” Albanese said. He says Australians worried about the future of work, need to be reassured that technological change will unlock new opportunities while still providing economic security. “The unprecedented pace of change and spread of new technologies are leaving many workers unsettled, and others left out of the labour market altogether.” Albanese said that to restore confidence in the labour market, workers needed to be helped to engage with technology and innovation in “an assured manner”, which would require “the single-minded pursuit of skills”. This would help address a mismatch between what workers have to offer and what employers need, with Albanese highlighting a recent Australian Industry Group survey that three quarters of businesses cannot find the skilled workers they need. “In short we have a labour market characterised by the mismatch between what workers have to offer, and what employers need,” Albanese said. He criticised the government for issuing half a million visas to foreign workers over the past six years. “Instead, what we should be doing – wherever possible – is training Australians for current and future jobs.” On the issue of job security and industrial relations reform, Albanese said the current industrial relations system was being “strained” by the emergence of new forms of employment arrangements, pointing to the rise of the gig economy as an example. “These Australians deserve a greater sense of security,” Albanese said. “It is time to have a conversation about new forms of worker protections, which can be made as flexible as the gig economy jobs they could cover, as well as benefit more traditional industries – ideas like portable entitlements.” The new skills pledge comes alongside a push by Albanese to recast Labor’s climate policy as part of a new industrial “revolution”, saying the shift to clean energy will underpin an Australian manufacturing boom that unlocks new jobs and export opportunities. “The world is decarbonising. With the right planning and vision, Australia can not only continue to be an energy exporting superpower, we can also enjoy a new manufacturing boom. This means jobs,” Albanese said. “Working towards a low-carbon future provides the opportunity to revitalise the Australian manufacturing sector – opportunities that are all about jobs.” The speech comes as Labor MPs jostle over how the party should reposition itself on climate policy after the shadow resources minister, Joel Fitzgibbon, called for the opposition to abandon its emissions reduction target in favour of the coalition’s less ambitious plan to reduce emissions by 28% on 2005 levels by 2030. Labor had proposed an emissions reduction target of 45% in the same period. In a sign that Albanese wants to maintain the party’s action on climate change as a key point of difference with the coalition, he used Tuesday’s speech to emphasise the benefits of an ambitious emissions reduction policy for jobs in the renewable energy sector. Labelling climate change “one of the greatest challenges that we face today”, Albanese also says that countries which act to harness cheap renewable energy would also be able to transform into “manufacturing powerhouses”. “We have the highest average solar radiation per square metre of any continent, we also have some of the best wind and wave resources and we have some of the best engineers and scientists, breaking the barriers of what is possible with renewable energy,” Albanese said. “Australia can be the land of cheap and endless energy – energy that could power generations of metal manufacturing and other energy intensive manufacturing industries.” He points to the potential export opportunities of lithium, rare earths, iron and titanium as the “key ingredients” of the renewables revolution, saying the minerals would be in high demand in a low-carbon future. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “Just as coal and iron ore fuelled the industrial economies of the 20th century, it is these minerals that will fuel the clean energy economies of the 21st,” Albanese said, pointing to the growing demand for lithium for electric vehicles, batteries and energy storage. But the Labor leader also assured “traditional industries” that they would benefit from the shift to renewables, saying the demand for metallurgical coal would continue, fuelled by growth in wind energy. Labor has been at pains to reconnect with coal communities since its election defeat, amid concern that blue-collar workers abandoned the party in its traditional stronghold seats. The former leader Bill Shorten has said since the election that he had misread “some of the mood”, particularly in the resources states of Queensland and Western Australia, saying voters saw some of the party’s policies as “being green-left, not for the worker, not for working people.” “It pains me to realise at the last election our presentation meant that some people felt we weren’t putting jobs first and foremost in everything we did,” Shorten said. Labor’s shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has said there was a perception that Labor was “sending mixed messages on the coal industry” during the campaign, while Fitzgibbon has said it was a “huge error” for Labor not to talk about coal because of a fear that it would cost city seats. Albanese said that with more than 200 tonnes of metallurgical coal required to produce one wind turbine, growth in global wind generation over the next decade could see Australia exporting 15.5 million tonnes of coking coal to build turbines. “This is the equivalent of three years output from the Moranbah North coking coal mine in Queensland,” Albanese said. “Simply put, the road to a low-carbon future can be paved with hundreds of thousands of clean energy jobs, as well as supporting traditional jobs, including coalmining. Labor wants to lead that clean energy revolution.” The first of Albanese’s headland speeches comes as the party braces for the release of a review of the election that is being spearheaded by Jay Weatherill and Craig Emerson to establish what went wrong in its campaign, with climate policy and the party’s position on the Adani coalmine expected to be scrutinised. Albanese has said the review will be a “line in the sand” for the party as it seeks to reassess all of its policies ahead of the next election, due in 2022. Along with the focus on green jobs, Albanese also called for the government to introduce an upgraded investment guarantee, saying it should form part of a “measured” economic stimulus package. “A bring-forward of infrastructure investment combined with increased business investment would create jobs in the short term as well as lift productivity.”"
"Zookeepers at Thiory Zoo, near Paris, recently arrived at work to find their four-year-old rhinoceros, Vince, dead from a gunshot to the head. The larger of his two horns had been cut off with a chainsaw. The poachers responsible had forced open one grill and two locked doors in order to get into the rhino’s enclosure. Police presume that the smaller horn was not taken, and the zoo’s other two rhinos were not killed, because the poachers either did not have time or were interrupted.  There is speculation that the poachers are “professionals” and the horn will be smuggled to Asia.  No matter how shocking and heartbreaking it is to hear about the murder of this rhino, it should come as little surprise. In their native habitats the five species of rhino are at best “near threatened” and at worst “critically endangered” because they are poached for their horns. According to the charity Save the Rhino the total worldwide population was around 500,000 at the beginning of the 20th century. Today, there are just 29,000 left.  Vince’s species, the southern white rhino, is actually a conservation success story, as it has come back from the brink of extinction a century ago to an estimated population of at least 19,000. The good news ends there though. The black rhino population is estimated to be just over 5,000 individuals; the greater one-horn rhino over 3,500, and the Javan and Sumatran rhinos both under 100. Even the southern white’s numbers can’t protect it from poaching: if current death rates continue, it may become extinct in the wild by 2023. There are huge profits to be made from poaching rhinos. Demand from Asia, where there is a long history of rhino horn in traditional medicine, means each horn can fetch tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars on the black market. This makes it one of the most expensive commodities in the world – potentially more valuable per kilo than diamonds or cocaine.  But poaching in the wild is getting harder. Anti-poaching technology is getting smarter, wardens are being militarised, and there are simply fewer rhinos left to target. The logical next step is for poachers and organised crime to adapt and choose “soft” targets such as zoos, safari parks and sanctuaries. There’s evidence this is already happening: an Irish organised crime group, the Rathkeale Rovers, is allegedly responsible for 60 rhino horn thefts from natural history museums across Europe. Poaching in the west may not even be limited to “organised” crime groups. In the case of Vince the rhino, one grill, two locked doors and some surveillance cameras are not exactly sophisticated technology that “unorganised” criminals wouldn’t be able to get around.  But we shouldn’t be surprised if Vince’s killers turn out to be professionals. Organised crime, like most wildlife crime, adapts to conditions and looks for new opportunities to make money. Zoos seem to be ready targets where the benefits are very high and the risk of getting caught very low. The horn is probably on its way to Asia, but let’s not forget that Europe is one of the three top consumers of illegal wildlife. China and the US are the other two. So while Europeans may have a reputation for being wildlife and animal lovers, there is a dark side to the continent’s relationship with wildlife that is often ignored.  Zoos and safari parks should increase their security measures and vigilance as chances are rhinos will not be the only victims of poaching in Europe because of the illegal wildlife trade. And that’s regardless of whether the demand is from inside or outside of Europe and if the poachers are organised crime or not."
"According to some animal rights groups the grey squirrel is a victim of circumstance. They say it has been made a scapegoat for regional red squirrel population extinctions and claim that loss of the reds is caused entirely coincidentally by habitat change. They suggest the true facts are being hidden and scientific research being intentionally misinterpreted.  If so, then this conspiracy must extend to British legal provisions and EU directives both listing the grey squirrel as an invader to be controlled, right?  Well, no – put this argument to the test and you’ll see that the facts actually do stack up against the grey squirrel. The reality is that, while the grey squirrel is an important part of North American forest ecosystems, since being brought to Europe by the Victorians in 1876, the animal has had severe ecological and economic impacts on British woodlands.  Acrobatic and entertaining they may be, but the charge sheet against the grey squirrel is based on hundreds of peer-reviewed research papers. There really is no defence for it.  Today there are approximately 2.5m grey squirrels in Britain, but less than 140,000 reds. Grey squirrels out-compete native reds for food and space. They also dig up and consume seed that red squirrels have buried as a winter store. This behaviour reduces red squirrel skeletal growth rates and adult size, and greatly depresses juvenile survival rates too.  In addition, greys harbour infections – including squirrel pox, which can devastate red squirrel populations. They elevate local viral and nematode infection rates, and bring in new parasites, such as Strongyloides robustus, which are picked up by red squirrels. Occasionally a healthy red squirrel is found with squirrel pox antibodies – some researchers have suggested that this is evidence of them evolving resistance to the pox. Unfortunately, 63% of red squirrels dying from pox have also been found to have this antibody response present and there is no evidence that these antibodies confer immunity. Even if they did, research has also shown that antibodies are gone within 18 months and, irrespective of any resistance, red populations would be replaced by grey via competition anyway. Grey squirrels also damage and kill forest trees making it impossible for foresters to grow high-grade hardwood. This means such material is imported instead, bringing with it the risk of new tree pests and pathogens. Tree damage is most frequently seen on the branches and trunks of oak, beech and maple; bark is stripped by squirrels eager to consume the the sap underneath. Tree stems break or die following stripping, which in turn leads to changes in the structure and species composition of high canopy in amenity woodlands. Even songbirds are affected by grey squirrels. A recent study gave evidence of negative association between woodland songbird fledging rates and presence of grey squirrels – though it must be noted that this was not observed annually and only seen on some of the sites studied. Earlier studies didn’t find evidence to indicate greys affect bird population, but also didn’t exclude the possibility – even for bird species whose population is increasing overall.  Other animals may be affected by greys too: there has been some suggestion that squirrels compete with dormice for hazel nuts, though more research is needed to confirm the true impact. The Wildlife Trust has recently started to recruit 5,000 volunteers to monitor and control grey squirrel populations. However, a look beyond the headlines will reveal thousands of people are already legally trapping and shooting greys across the country to control their numbers. Volunteer groups cull 6,000 grey squirrels per year in the north of England, for example. Even in areas where reds are absent, locals control grey squirrels to protect woodlands or prevent damage to property. This is not some dramatic new approach by the Wildlife Trust, but is simply reinforcing an established national movement. The eradication of greys from the Welsh isle of Anglesey saw red squirrel numbers increase from 40 to 700 and there are other examples of grey control halting or reversing red squirrel decline. Research has also demonstrated that red squirrels do not prefer conifer to broadleaved habitat and are just as happy in either. Future control may involve giving the squirrels contraception, but will almost certainly not rely solely on this because of logistical barriers. The pine marten may assist in some landscapes too: one Irish study found a strong negative correlation between pine martens and greys in the woodlands studied. However, the use of trapping and shooting will inevitably continue as part of an integrated national approach. And so the grey squirrel stands guilty as charged. Their presence has decimated the British countryside since they were introduced from North America, and if we do not continue to control the species, the future for red squirrels and woodland ecosystems will be bleak."

Share this...FacebookTwitterAlways more expensive, never cheaper– renewable energy feed-in tariffs to climb to 6.24 cents in 2014
By Rudolf Kipp, Science Skeptical
(Translated, edited by P Gosselin)
“Payments for renewable energy will cost each household on average about 1 euro per month – that’s as much as one scoop of ice cream.”  That’s what Jürgen Trittin, former Federal Environment Minister, Green Party, said in July 2004 when Germany’s EEG renewable energy Feed-In Act) was enacted.
“Now it costs as much as every item on the entire ice cream menu,” said Peter Altmaier, current Federal Minister of Environment, September 2013 at the 8th German Energy Congress “Energy Economy in Transition”.
German feed-in rates skyrocketing
Recently a press release from power grid operators 50Hertz, Amprion, TenneT and TransnetBW (link) was issued. Here is what it announced:
(…) The EEG feed-in levy is to be paid for each kilowatt-hour consumed by all end-consumers. That means that the consumers will have to pay 6.240 cents per kilowatt hour in order to support renewable energies. Thus the costs for the EEG feed-in will increase almost 20 percent compared to a year earlier (5.277 cents per kilowatt-hour).
For the year 2014 another considerable increase in the generation of renewable electrical energy is projected. The increase of approximately 15 terawatt-hours(from about 135 TWh in 2013 to almost 150 TWh in 2014) is mainly from onshore wind, offshore wind, and photovoltaic.
The following chart depicts the cost development for consumers from the EEG feed-in tariff, from 2003 to 2014, (eeg-kwk.net):

The next figure shows the electric power price development in Germany (Statista):

So much for renewable energies staying affordable, as politicians promised us just some years ago.
What follows are more famous quotes from politicians and hustlers, all telling the consumers how renewable energy would stay cheap and affordable for every German. You be the judge on whether or not they were truthful.
2004 Greenpeace:
….The costs to be paid by consumers for the Feed-In Act (EEG fees)) will remain practically constant compared to the current level.”
2005 German Environment Ministry:
The increase in the EEG feed-in tariffs will reduce in the future and will not cost more than 3 euros a month, even with a very dynamic expansion. The feed-in rates will then start to go down by the middle of the next decade.”
In 2005 the EEG feed-In fees were only 0.68 cent/kwh. This year Germans are paying more than 250 euros per year.
2006 Engineering Office for new energies:
As a whole the current EEG feed-in cost of approximately 0.54 cents/kwh will increase to a maximum of 0.93 cents/kwh by 2017.”
Already in 2006 the EEG feed-in tariff was 0.88 cents/kwh. In 2014 it will 6.24 cents/kwh, i.e. 7 times higher!

2007 Solarportal 24:
Already today consumers are saving significantly more than they are paying for the EEG feed-in act. The huge supply of energy from wind, water, sun, bioenergy, and geothermal is leading to a dampening effect on the price of electricity, this according to the Federal Association of Renewable Energies, BEE.”
German Environment Ministry:
Because of the EEG feed-in act, the feed-in cost for electricity will rise a bit. According to the law that applies, it will increase to a maximum of about 1.4 cents/kwh by the year 2015, after which it will again drop.“
In 2013 the EEG fee will rise to a whopping 6.24 cents/kwh, and there is no end in sight for the spiraling costs.
2009 Federal Association of Renewable Energies:
The EEG feed-in will reach its maximum of approx. 1.4 cents/kwh by 2013/2014.”
Today we know that figure will rise to 6.24 cents/kwh next year with no slowdown in sight.
2010 German Ministry of Environment:
The EEG feed-in cost for 2011 according to a current study of the German Ministry of Environment (BMU) will be about 2.8 cents. The study looks at the ‘long-term scenarios and strategies for the expansion of renewable energies in Germany while taking the development in Europe and the globe into account’, and also sees no exploding EEG feed-in costs for the coming years.”
Reality: costs have exploded.
2011
Angela Merkel on September 6 in a government address:
The EEG feed-in costs must not rise more than today’s levels; today it is at about 3.5 cents/kwh. Over the long-term we want to significantly lower the payment for electricity coming from renewable energies.”
2012 
Eicke R. Weber, Director of the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems:
The expansion of renewable energies will lead to very little price increases for the consumers.
(…) After 2020, however, we expect renewable energies to become an important share and will stabilize the prices, and thus we will experience a dampening in electricity prices.”
The EEG feed-in cost will surge to 6.24 cents/kwh next year. There are no signs of a price slowdown.
2013
Federal Environment Minister Peter Altmaier:
We are not paying for the transformation over to renewable energies from petty cash.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterSWR German Public radio had a segment today featuring the warmist director at Germany’s Ministry of Environment, Harry Lehmann, climate scientist Hans von Storch and Spiegel science reporter Axel Bojanowski.
LISTEN HERE IN GERMAN
What follows is my report on the segment.
SWR moderator Gábor Paál says right at the outset regarding the 15-year global warming stop, “Climate science is no longer certain like it was a few years earlier“.
Hans von Storch (HvS) says from 0:52 to 2:21 that the temperature has not developed like the models said it would, saying that there could be several explanations for that: 1) could be just a grand coincidence, 2) the models have gotten natural variations all wrong, 3) it could be that CO2’s assumed climate sensitivity is somewhat exaggerated, and 4) it could be that there is another factor out there that we never considered, like the sun. HvS adds that he sees himself and his fellow scientist “as hard pressed to explain what’s going on” and that this is so because “climate science is so highly politicized and because we have colleagues who claim things with great certainty that later turn out to be not so certain.”
At the 2:30 mark the warmist Ministry of Environment Dr. Harry Lehmann is asked if all the uncertainty is a problem for him. He responds with “yes and no“, and claims that there is a 90-95% certainty that there is manmade climate change and that policymakers have to act as a precaution. Surprisingly he admits that there has been a warming stop and that the models were wrong and that more research is necessary. But he insists climate protection measures are still necessary as before.
At the 3:50 mark geologist and Spiegel journalist Axel Bojanowski explains that the uncertainty in climate science is indeed headline news and that today there is an overdue need to discuss these uncertainties, which was something the media neglected in the past.
At the 4:42 mark on whether the oceans may be responsible, von Storch says that “this could be an explanation” but that the main problem is the models are failing to show what we are now observing. Hans von Storch states in no uncertain terms that climate scientists have not been taking the scientific approach of examining all potential hypotheses. Instead some climate scientists are motivated by certain special interests, and are choosing the hypothesis that best suits their needs, and are thus choking off real science. HvS adds: “We need to take the time to formulate the various hypotheses and to sort them out. This is going to take some time. And that may be inconvenient for the political business.” He adds in response to Fritz Vahrenholt’s The Neglected Sun book that “the sun is a candidate that needs to be checked over.”
At the 8:19 mark HvS makes his displeasure with politics clear in no uncertain terms. “As a scientist. I tell policymakers absolutely nothing. Politics does not result from science. Activists like to claim that it does.” Lehmann responds by claiming that politicians are obligated to act as a precaution based on the best science at hand so that the human species can survive in 15 years or 100 years time.
On the upcoming IPCC AR5, Bojanowski says that except for the sea level rise projection being pushed up, little has changed from AR4. On the 95% certainty that man is responsible for the climate change, Bojanowski says flat out: “This is naturally not a scientific number, but a number that was voted on by a few scientists” and this figure is based on very shaky ground.
Lehmann says that the deficiencies in the AR4 have since been resolved, but HvS is unconvinced, saying “that remains to be seen” and that the IPCC report is still vulnerable to activist scientists who fancy themselves as planet rescuers – there’s nothing in place to prevent that type of a conflict of interest. Bojanowski adds that the improvements to the IPCC process have only been partially implemented and that there is still a big problem with transparency and that we are still “dealing with a very difficult construct that we need to be critical of.”
At the 15:00 mark Bojanowski is asked about whether or not the 15-year pause is going to be mentioned in the upcoming summary report, to which he responds that this is being hotly disputed. HvS reminds Lehmann that especially he, as a director in the Environment Ministry, really needs to know about the 15-year pause and what the implications of this are for the future. It really needs to be mentioned. Lehmann insists: “Even though the models failed to foresee the 15- years pause, they do show that the climate change is man-made“. At this point HvS sits Lehmann down and schools him, reminding him: “Models don’t show climate change is man-made, data do. Not the models!” Von Storch adds that right now the models are not adequate for projecting the future because they only look at increased CO2 concentrations and not a host of other factors. At this point, HvS is tearing poor Lehmann apart, getting close to humiliating the poor environment director.

HvS goes on to explain to listeners that climate is “horribly complex matter” and that there are just so many variables that are poorly understood, citing clouds, aerosols and that the oceans are not even close to being modeled adequately. He says he expects research to yield surprises here.
Later there’s much discussion about the 2°C target. HvS tells listeners that it’s a political number that gladly gets used by politicians and activist scientists, and that it is not a scientific one. HvS advocates regions and countries developing their own adaptation strategies and that a centralized IPCC is not really what’s needed. Local regions know better what needs to be done to adapt to local climate changes. HvS advocates reductions in CO2, but what’s affordable for each area.
The discussion drags on for awhile about the effectiveness and value of the IPCC. Bojanowski mentions again that the IPCC process is far from transparent and that too much is taking place behind closed doors. This is not how science is supposed to be.
HvS believes a good scientific report includes both consensus and dissent. The IPCC strives only for the “best science”, and how does on differentiate between good and bad science? The exclusion of dissent is not the idea.
At the 32-minute mark, moderator Paál brings up the notorious brochure/ that Lehmann’s office published in May, which singled out and pilloried dissenting scientists and journalists. Paál correctly points out the brochure’s one-sidedness and asks why it failed to discuss the obvious uncertainties, and claimed the science was settled. “Why can’t your Ministry truthfully deal with the uncertainties?” But Lehmann insisted it does deal with uncertainties and that it serves as an information guide for the citizens. Paál: “But like I said, there was nothing about the warming phase in it“. Lehmann here shamelessly tries to weasel out, claiming that the warming pause discussion started only 2 years ago.
Concerning the brochure’s infamous pillory of skeptic journalists and scientists, Lehmann also tries to deny that they were pilloried. Hans von Storch immediately shot back “Yes they certainly were pilloried“. Again Lehmann tried to deny the brochure’s one-sidedness. Bojanowski interjected, saying “the brochure was not balanced” and he wonders what business is it for a federal ministry to “warn the public of certain journalists“.
Paál asks Lehmann if the federal Environment Ministry is more cozy with some institutes (like the Potsdam Institute) than with others. HvS answers: “Certainly”. Lehmann shamelessly denies that, too. Unbelievable. Then Lehmann flat out lies about his ties and function in support organizations of the Potsdam Institute.
On the subject of media quality, HvS feels the print media has been doing a good job on reporting climate, but that television leaves much less to be desired, saying some outlets are too focused on catastrophic images and alarmism. He also senses a public that is growing weary of the topic, that they are losing interest, and no longer want to be bothered with the dubious predictions of global downfall.
In then end von Storch sums up saying: “If the warming pause continues another five years, then perhaps our understanding of climate was more faulty than we thought.”
If this 45-minute SWR German public radio discussion was meant to be a debate, Lehmann lost it big time, at times looking foolish and lacking understanding of climate science. HvS definitely looked like he lost patience with the politicization of climate science. Bojanowski overall made a good impression of a careful and balanced science journalist who understood the material at hand.
German readers are invited to listen to and comment on the SWR interview.

"Thank you to all the readers and Guardian supporters around the world who have responded to our environmental pledge, in which we outlined five important journalistic and institutional steps we will take to play a leading role in reporting on the climate catastrophe. The response has been overwhelming, with thousands of you across more than 100 countries making the choice to support us with a contribution. Many of you have told us how much you value our commitment: to be truthful, resolute and undeterred in pursuing this important journalism. We made this pledge because we recognise the climate emergency as the defining issue of our lifetimes.  As Guardian editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, wrote, “We have always led the way in environmental reporting … but now, more than ever, we believe the Guardian’s specialist team of reporters, editors and writers has a vital role to play in working with our readers to understand the unfolding climate crisis and all its ramifications.” Reader support means we are all becoming part of a global community with a shared set of values and a vision for a more hopeful world. It also means we can give reporting on the environment the urgent attention and prominence it demands. We can report on the climate crisis with consistent rigour and ground our journalism in scientific fact, never driven by political or commercial interests. Our independence makes this journalism possible and support from our readers helps protect that independence. In our pledge, we acknowledge that the planet is in the grip of an emergency. We have made a commitment to continue our long-standing record of powerful environment reporting, which is known around the world. By this, we mean undertaking investigations into the economic and political structures that underpin the carbon economy, such as our recent series, The Polluters, and examining the role the climate crisis plays in many other critical issues – including inequality, migration and the battle over scarce resources. Alongside our journalistic commitments, we also looked at important steps we could take as an organisation. We committed to the Guardian achieving net zero emissions by 2030. Some of our senior environment correspondents have shared with us the mix of hope and despair they experience in the course of their roles. But despite the challenges, they are united in a shared sense of urgency, and the need for change. Reflecting on covering the climate crisis, Jonathan Watts, the Guardian’s global environment editor, wrote this week: “I report from the Amazon to the Arctic on the disappearing wonders of a rapidly deteriorating world. Along with a growing number of colleagues, I investigate who is affected, who is to blame and who is fighting back. This is both depressing and exciting. The trends for the climate, the oceans, the forests and the soil are unrelentingly frightening. Humanity has never faced a more wicked problem than the collapse of these natural life support systems. Nobody is free of responsibility. Everybody has something to lose, especially those with the most power. The challenge is huge, urgent and beset with opponents. But change is happening nonetheless.” Thank you to our readers and supporters for joining us in facing this challenge. Your responses are galvanising, making us even surer of our approach. We share in the belief that factual, independent and open journalism is vital if we are to drive real change. If you’re able to, we hope you will consider supporting the Guardian today by making a single or recurring contribution or subscribing. Every reader contribution, however big or small, is so valuable for our future."

It’s the book they don’t want you to read.
The Neglected Sun is back on sale (at least in the UK) after the first printing was sold out.
Some readers wrote me saying that they were no longer able to order the book. I don’t know how many copies were printed this time around, but if you are planning to pick up copies to give away for Christmas, for someone’s birthday, or to educate some hysterical warmist, then do get them while you can.
The book makes a strong case against the one-sided IPCC AR5 report, whereby unbelievably its authors are now struggling with whether or not to mention the significantly 15 year warming pause that embarrassed their models.
The German version was released one and half years ago, and so far all the recent studies are confirming precisely what Vahrenholt and Lüning are claiming and showing: no warming, Co2 exaggerated, oceans play a major role, models are totally inadequate, etc.
Last I’ve heard, the IPCC AR5 authors will claim sea ice will be melting faster as temperature slows down. Now that’s confusion. Obviously they are bending over backwards to insert alarmism in the report.

"Actress Julie Hesmondhalgh was right to express her concerns that arts education is seen as a luxury (“Soap star attacks school arts funding ‘conspiracy’”, News). Her comments were in response to the findings of the Durham Commission on Creativity and Education, which reported concerns about the reduction of the status of arts subjects, including art and design, dance, drama and music, within schools following the introduction of the English baccalaureate in secondary education. With regards to music in particular, the all-party parliamentary group for music education’s report, Music Education: State of Nation, demonstrates how the narrow range of Ebacc subjects has prevented students from studying at some secondary schools; music is no longer taught at key stage 3 in more than half of state-funded secondary schools. By her admission, Hesmondhalgh was not born into financial privilege but into state privilege, where she had access to creative subjects in her state school. If the Ebacc policy is not to be scrapped, we hope the Department for Education takes notice of her example and of the advice of the Durham commission, and extends the Ebacc to include a sixth pillar for arts subjects. Otherwise, access to a well-rounded education and its benefits will be the preserve of the privileged few.Deborah Annetts, chief executiveIncorporated Society of MusiciansLondon W2Julie Hesmondhalgh is right. What gets kids up in the morning? “I’ve got PE today or art” or something creative to balance up the subjects they are less confident with. Kids are active and don’t we know it! They like doing things and gaining confidence and as a teacher I have seen this so many times. Children find what they are good at, confidence grows and this floods over into all their work. They need the creative subjects to balance up the academic curriculum. As less than 50% go on to university one could make the point that for the other half an academic curriculum is inappropriate.  The Tories are starving education of funds. It is quite deliberate – they want people to pay for their music, art, craft, drama, PE, which cuts out the poorer section of society.Peter BranfordBirch Green, Hertford, Herts Catherine Bennett’s criticism of Extinction Rebellion’s tactics is very clever but offers nothing useful in the way of suggestions about alternative means of raising public consciousness (“The Extinction Rebels have a noble cause. What they don’t need now is tactical stupidity”, Comment). I am white, middle class, well educated and affluent. I’ve devoted all of my time in the past six months and a considerable amount of money in legal and other costs to the Extinction Rebellion campaign. Could Catherine Bennett or anyone who shares her views please explain: (a) why they think it is helpful or reasonable to sneer at my sacrifices; (b) what they think could be done to attract a different demographic to the cause; and (c) why the people from those demographics who are not doing what they can to bring about change should themselves be exempt from criticism?Chris NeillGodalming, Surrey With respect to “The big picture” (New Review), photographer Simon Buckley was right in saying that “it appeals to the essence of what people believe Manchester is”. However, as another northerner, I would suggest that Stephen Fry looks further back to LS Lowry’s teacher, Adolphe Valette, whose “Manchester-scapes” are a better precedent for Buckley’s stunning photograph.Christine HawkesCambridge It is eventually time to have a go at fireworks again (“We all ooh and aah, bug isn’t everyone sick of fireworks now?”, Comment). I don’t like the thought of pets being frightened by bangers but it is the responsibility of owners to keep their pets safe during bonfire season. Bonfire is a very important matter here in Sussex. The bonfire societies are a wonderful way for children and young people to learn responsibility and they help ensure that a wonderful time is had in Lewes on 5 November. We are remembering a very important moment in our history and having fun as well. Why does everything have to be sanitised? Long may we be allowed to continue.Polly CranfieldBarcombe, Lewes Nick Cohen reminded us of Jacob Rees-Mogg’s egregious instruction to his staff always to put “esq” when addressing an envelope to a man (“The great men theory of history is no more. Meet the catastrophic men…” Comment). Ha! It just proves how phoney he is. No, Mr Rees-Mogg, a man is only an esquire if he is of a certain birth. You would have to check with Debrett’s to get the full requirements.Antonia TillLondon N1 Will Hutton, I am a working-class guy from a northern city and I completely disagree with you (“We marched with hope but few expectations. Yet history will side with us”, Comment). The reason I voted Leave wasn’t some misty-eyed imperial nostalgia or groundless faith. It was a hard-nosed “what’s in it for me?” assessment of where my best interests lie. And the answer is as far away from European integration as possible. You say leaving the EU will devastate the north and trash our economy? I say it already has. Automation took half the jobs so, given the labour market is already difficult, how does it help my prospects if uncontrolled immigration adds 600,000 people every year? Likewise for housing, school places, hospital appointments... Every service and resource is stretched further because the parliament supposed to represent and protect our citizens cares more about keeping big corporations happy with low taxes and a steady flow of cheap labour. Is it any wonder we hate them? Is it any wonder we want to put control of our lives back in our own hands and not in some Brussels office under a foreigner we neither know nor can remove from power? You say half the country didn’t vote for Brexit and that we should have a confirmatory vote to leave, but half the country did vote to leave and will do again. Remainers won’t quit and neither will Leavers, so the cycle of deadlock and national decay will only continue. One side has to win conclusively or this will never end without bloodshed and sorrow. Dan RaineyHull Further to your article about the BBC series World on Fire and Poland’s role in history (“Britain’s Poles hope war drama will reclaim their past”, Focus), I would like to draw your attention to two other watersheds that are often overlooked. They are the siege of Vienna in 1683 and the battle of Warsaw in 1920. The centenary of the latter, fought during the Polish-Soviet war, is imminent. Its historical and political significance has been conveniently forgotten by many, yet it saw a near-defeated Polish army turn the tables on the Red Army. It was the only land defeat suffered by the Soviet army in the 20th century. In both cases, Poland twice saved Europe from unwelcome invaders. BK PolachowskiGreasby, Wirral"

Henrik Svensmark wrote the book on cosmic rays, their possible effect on clouds, and thus effect on climate, as well as numerous papers on the subject. The CERN CLOUD experiment has looked for proof of the mechanism. A recent paper by Spencer and Braswell has looked at the relationship between clouds and temperature and found a nine month lag between a gap in cloudiness and El Niño temperature rises. Another pair of papers (Dragić et al) here and here, look at diurnal temperature variations within a few days of Forbush decreases. If cosmic ray variations result in cloud variation, which then result in temperature variation, then it is reasonable to examine the relationship between cosmic rays as seen in the surface neutron flux, and temperature.
Neutron flux data was downloaded from the Oulu University Cosmic Ray Station web site. This data is available back to 1964 in several file resolutions. Here is a plot with monthly resolution compared to the HADSST3 sea-surface temperature data set.


Figure 1 is the Oulu Neutron count plotted with HASSST3. The Neutron count has been inverted so that warming is upward in both plots. Each solar cycle has been plotted in a different color and the R-squared values computed for each cycle.
The first observation is that for the first 22 years, there is a relationship between neutron flux and sea-surface temperature. But after about 1986 that relationship breaks down.
The monthly data plot in Figure 1 does not resolve Forbush decreases because they generally last but a few days. Figure 2 is a daily data plot with the Forbush decreases highlighted. Again, the plot is inverted to indicate warming in the upward direction.

Figure 2 is a plot of daily neutron count data with the Forbush Decreases highlighted in red and green. The vertical scale is inverted. 
Twenty three Forbush decreases were found and daily data plotted together in Figure 3 with the peak of the decrease at the day zero. Neutron count data 30 days prior and 140 days after the Forbush decrease were plotted. The legend records the date at the beginning of each plot.

Figure 3 is a plot of 23 Forbush decreases recorded at Oulu since 1964.

Figure 4 is the average for all 23 Forbush Decreases. The vertical scale is NOT inverted in figures 3 and 4.
On average a Forbush decrease is about 14 days wide at the 10% point and 5 to 7 days wide at the 50% point. The average decrease in neutron flux is about 10%, but this can range widely from under 5% to over 20%.
The temperature data available on the web is generally available only as monthly or annual data. Temperature data was averaged for events in each solar cycle from two months prior to at least a year after each event. Forbush events occur randomly, and not at convenient month ends, so the nearest months to each event were plotted. This blurs the resolution somewhat. El Niño 3.4, GISSLOTI, and HADSST3 data were compared. The El Niño data is from NCAR. The GISSLOTI and HADSST3 monthly data from woodfortrees.

Figure 5 is a plot of the average temperature effects for Forbush events from 1964 to 1976, 1977 to 1986, 1987 to 1996, and 1997 to the present.
The temperature changes seen here are quite large, more than half a degree, but the averaged signal is quite noisy because there are so few events. The first period (Solar Cycle 20) shows a warming peak at four months, but the second period (Cycle 21) has the warming delayed until the seventh month and later. The last two periods show little pattern.
If the total period is split into just two portions, pre and post 1987, we get Figure 6.

Figure 6 is the temperature effect on the El Niño 3.4 area of Forbush events pre and post 1987.
Before 1987, a Forbush Event resulted in an ocean surface temperature rise in the El Niño 3.4 region of about a quarter of a degree on average, 4 to 7 months after the event, but only in the pre 1987 data.

Figure 7 is the temperature effect on GISTemp Land-Ocean Temperature Index Anomaly, pre and post 1987.
The full scale amplitude of both left and right scales is 0.2°. There is a 0.4° offset between the left and right scales. A peak at seven months is seen only in the pre-1987 data.

Figure 8 is the temperature effect on HADSST3 pre and post 1887. Left and right scales are the same amplitude, just offset 0.3°.
Again, only in pre-1987 data do we see a sea-surface temperature warming 4 to 7 months after Forbush events. Why should this be?
What changed in the late 1980’s? There seems to have been two steps in warming: the first with the spring of 1987 El Niño, the second with the spring 1997 super-El Niño. These El Niños were not started by any Forbush event.
They seem to have arisen from natural ENSO cycles. Perhaps sea surface temperatures simply reached a point where Forbush event cloud changes have little added effect.
We know that warming has stopped at the step of 1997. We see the cosmic ray/neutron flux levels increasing, which should result in cooling, yet we don’t observe cooling yet. The results above would seem to indicate that since 1987, natural ocean cycles may have overwhelmed cosmic ray affects. There seems to be a natural limit to sea surface temperatures at about 30°C, which is regularly reached in much of the tropical Pacific, and lack of clouds will not drive it higher. I would like to see input from Henrik Svensmark, Roy Spencer, Bob Tisdale, Willis Eschenbach or Nicola Scaffetta.

"The close correlation between diet and environment that has been demonstrated by Michael Clark at the University of Oxford (Healthy food choices best for people and planet, study shows, 29 October) is interesting and potentially important. I hope the researchers will extend their studies into the environmental impact of what is variously known as cultured, in vitro or lab-grown meat. These products are now reaching consumers and prices will fall. Ostensibly, they appear environmentally beneficial. The “meat” is grown from cell samples painlessly extracted from a small number of animals, so killing and long-distance freighting is eliminated. Methane from domestic ruminants will be drastically reduced. Forests need not be supplanted by grazing or soy production for animal feed. Land can be released for growing more plant-based food or to be returned to nature. If it can also be shown that environmental harm is curbed, the role these products can play will be crucial in reducing greenhouse gasses. More research is required as soon as possible.Patrick CosgroveChapel Lawn, Shropshire  • I take issue with your editorial on Extinction Rebellion (22 October) and whether it wishes to achieve “reform or revolution”. Neither, thank you. Our three aims are clear: truth-telling by government, rapid action towards zero-carbon emissions, and – for many of us the most important one – a citizens’ assembly charged with mapping out the best ways in which the UK can address the climate emergency. We believe a citizens’ assembly, like the Irish one that addressed abortion, can create a plan that most members of this country would buy into and act upon. It is disappointing that the government shows no sign of accepting this modest request – but it also disappointing that journalists are not putting pressure on ministers to explain their thinking (if any) on this. Mark Haworth-BoothSwimbridge, Devon • This article was amended on 31 October 2019. Due to an editing error, Mark Haworth-Booth’s letter listed one of Extinction Rebellion’s aims as “truth-telling to government”. That should have been “truth-telling by government”, as he originally wrote.

Share this...FacebookTwitterEnvironmentalists for years have preached that wildlife and nature needed to be protected. But today to accomplish that aim, they tell us it’s necessary to industrialize our landscape with skyscraper-size noisy wind turbines.

Germany’s Federal Ministry of Environment buries its own study that windmills kill wildlife on a massive scale. Photo: Espen Lie Dahl. Photo not from Germany, for illustration only.
And we warned them that the wind farms were inefficient, unpredictable, and especially deadly to airborne wildlife. That of course clashed with their climate -rescue fantasies and so they just poohed-poohed that accusation. In Germany they have since erected 25,000 turbines.
Now, just 3 days ago, the online daily Kreiszeitung here reported on a new study about the devastating impacts of wind turbines on birds and bats:
According to a study, wind turbines in Germany kill hundreds regularly, and quite possibly even thousands of bats. The study could be explosive because it could lead to limitations for the turbines. But the scientists are not permitted to reveal the details.”
Cover-up – plain and simple. According to the Kreiszeitung, the study was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Environment (Germany’s equivalent of the EPA), and was carried out by scientists of the University of Hannover.
The study showed that the wind turbines between the Alps and the coasts killed tens of thousands of bats each year.”
The Kreiszeitung also quotes experts from the Society for the Preservation of Owls (EGE) to give readers an idea of the scale of killing taking place annually:
Based on the findings if you calculate for the current 25,000 wind turbines in Germany, a quarter million bats are killed every year.”

All this is going on in a country where construction of projects are routinely shut down in Germany so that birds aren’t disturbed from spring until mid summer during the mating season.
The embarrassing, but gory details of the study are being kept under tight wraps: “The scientists assured the windpark operators anonymity in the project, in which Germany’s branch leader Enercon assisted as a partner,  in exchange for their willingness for cooperation in the study.” The EGE Preservation of Owls Society is now demanding that the publicly funded results be released so that it can be determined exactly where the flying mammals are getting killed and so that appropriate action can be taken.
The EGE is citing Germany’s Nature Protection Act which forbids the killing of endangered species. This has turned into a really messy situation for the Federal Ministry of Environment. In a law-abiding society, permit applications for the construction of windparks in such regions would have to be rejected, and existing ones curtailed, or even shut down. But in an environmental tyranny based on tampered, clandestine science, the law simply gets trampled on. The Kreiszeitung writes:
What is explosive in this case: The German Federal Ministry of Environment (BMU) supported the study with 1.1 million euros. The accusation by the EGE Owl Society is now plain to see: The federal government gives tax money for a project, from which we discover that the studied windparks possibly must be subject to new requirements so that they conform to the law. But nothing is happening.”
The study is getting swept under the carpet. My guess is that another study (a dubious corrupt one) will be commissioned and it in turn will show that very few bats are being killed after all. And in the end, should the bats end up disappearing, then they’ll just blame it on climate change.
The Kreiszeitung ends its report by reminding readers that wind energy isn’t so rosy after all:
They don’t feed in power at a constant rate and thus still require baseload power from conventional power plants. Critics fear a forest of windmills covering the landscape. And for the wind power variant of offshore windparks, a cable would have to rip through the world heritage Wadden Sea. Offshore, there are hardly any bats but the construction noise is driving the whales away.”
By now it should be clear: The biggest threat to the environment are the dishonest bureaucrats who want us to believe they are saving it.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe fallout surrounding the profound failures of the climate models used by the IPCC continues. If the German media is anything to go by, then IPCC science is virtually disintegrating before our very eyes.
Europe has always been a bulwark against climate skepticism. No more. The online German ‘Die Welt’ daily reports today that the upcoming IPCC AR5 is a de facto withdrawal of the scientific basis for climate regulation.
Die Welt writes that “global warming is currently advancing considerably more slowly than assumed a few years ago” and has stalled over the last 15 years and that “scientists are unable to explain why“.
Basis for climate regulation crumbles
Die Welt then adds that the failed models and prognoses of the climate scientists will have profound implications for policymakers:
The IPCC results likely not only usher in a small change in the direction of the climate discussion and a retreat from the loudest alarmism, they also withdraw the firm basis of assumptions, which policymakers had considered undisputed for European and national climate regulations.”

Until recently, policymakers had always fallen back on “settled science” to justify painful measures to revamp energy supply. But now that “settled science” is gone. Justifying the vandalism of the landscape with windparks and selling high priced, unstable renewable energies to a skeptical public is about to get a whole lot tougher.
So why hasn’t warming increased as projected earlier? Die Welt writes:
One reason for that, according to the report, is that the calculation of the global warming by carbon dioxide emissions in the computer models was too heavily weighted.”
Already politicians are now calling for a new policy approach with regards to climate policy.
“It is being admitted for the first time that the climate is warming less than predicted,” European Parliamentarian Holger Krahmer is quoted by Die Welt. “It’s reason enough to refrain from making emissions trading more strict, to rethink the CO2 targets which are dangerous to the German automotive industry, and to stop further ecological bans of products.”

"Air pollution is often seen as a local problem requiring local and regional solutions. Karachi, London, Lagos, Mexico City and Paris are just a few of the world’s cities grappling with poor air quality. With city-dwellers increasingly being asked to ditch the car – especially if it’s diesel – and use greener modes of transport, it’s easy to forget that air is also mobile. As a result, there’s very little attention being paid to the impact of cross-border air pollution on human health and well-being. Globally, air pollution caused by microscopic fine particles (PM₂.₅) kills 3.5m people each year. These particles can easily enter the respiratory tract. They rank fifth worldwide among all risks to health after high blood pressure, smoking and diet. Breathing filthy air can increase the risk of heart disease, lung cancer, stroke and affect mental health. And it is the vulnerable in society who suffer the most, with 300m children currently breathing in toxic air. Indoor and outdoor air pollution, together with second-hand smoke, causes 570,000 deaths in children under five years of age each year, due to respiratory infections such as pneumonia. The movement of air pollutants from transport and agricultural activities in one country can affect the air quality in another. Such as the smoke from Indonesian forest fires which has caused a toxic haze to descend over parts of Malaysia and Singapore. Another example is the atmospheric brown cloud – a transnational air pollution phenomenon which contains aerosols such as soot and dust that poses risks to human health and food security, especially in Asia. Cross-border air pollution has been an issue for some time: in the 1970-80s, the UK was nicknamed the “dirty man of Europe” for belching out industrial sulphur emissions, which contributed to acid rain in Europe – a reputation that the Greens fear will be regained after Brexit.  But it’s only recently that the scale of the air pollution effects of international trade has been assessed, with one study suggesting that around 400,000 premature deaths occurred in 2007 in a different region of the world than the one in which the air pollutants were emitted. Goods and services produced in one region for use by another region are responsible for 22% (762,400) of air pollution-related deaths worldwide. In particular, Chinese particle emissions were responsible for 64,800 premature deaths in other regions, including over 3,000 deaths in Western Europe and the US. By contrast, Chinese products bought in Western Europe and the US are linked to over 100,000 deaths in China in one year.  International trade has seen many developed countries transferring their manufacturing abroad, in order to take advantage of cheap labour and lax environmental standards in often less wealthy nations. As a result, air pollution, including greenhouse gas emissions, has effectively been exported to developing countries. So, while murky grey images of smog smothered Beijing or New Delhi may prompt others to ask why they don’t clean up their act, it’s important to remember that these cities are shouldering an enormous manufacturing burden, as much of the world’s goods and services are outsourced to China and India.  There is now a need for governments to switch from calculating greenhouse gas emissions based on production to one based on consumption of goods and services. This has important implications for global climate and air mitigation policies because as much as 20% to 25% of overall carbon dioxide emissions come from the production of goods and services which are traded internationally. Although there has been success in achieving better air quality over the past the six decades, this doesn’t erase the need to face up to big global environment challenges. Cities are responsible for around 70% of global greenhouse gases. While carbon dioxide has warming influences on the climate in the long term, short-lived climate pollutants such as black carbon (a primary part of particulate matter), methane and ozone have warming influences on the climate in the near-term. Local action, such as banning diesel cars, addresses both air and climate pollutants. This can achieve immediate effects by reducing near-term warming and improving air quality levels. There are several international conventions to regulate air pollution and related issues. But for now, there’s no coherent legal framework which aims to protect the atmosphere. This has led to calls for a new Law of the Atmosphere to provide effective cooperation on air pollution and climate change at regional and global scales. As it stands, the likelihood of such a law gaining support is low, given the climate change scepticism exhibited by powerful world leaders such as presidents Trump and Putin. Everyone has the right to clean air. But air pollution requires no visas, and its devastating impact can be felt far from the source. No longer can the leaders of developed nations shy away from the fact that their citizens’ consumption and lifestyle choices have a significant impact on people in others part of the world. As consumers, we have the power and the responsibility to demand better environmental and social standards – so we can all breathe life, wherever we live."
"Today we take for granted an awareness of environmental matters, but this was not always the case. It could be said that in Britain there was a moment when that environmental consciousness arrived. When in 1963 some farm animals in the parish of Smarden in Kent became sick and died, suspicions fell on a nearby pesticide factory run by a division of Rentokil Laboratories. The events that followed amounted to one of the first environmental scandals in contemporary British history – one that would galvanise the environmental movement. It became clear that the factory, a large shed in the middle of farmland, was manufacturing toxic chemicals and that a leak of one of these, fluoroacetamide, led to Britain’s first documented livestock mass poisoning. The incident might have passed by as only a historical footnote, but instead the Smarden leak quickly became a national concern with international implications, and has cast a long shadow across the approach to intensive agriculture in the UK in the years since. Part of why this incident had such major repercussions is due to timing, coming as it did at the same time as American writer Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring was first published in the UK. Seen as the first polemic of the environmental movement, Carson’s book was a significant catalyst to the emergence of modern environmentalism on both sides of the Atlantic. Local veterinarian Douglas Good had unique knowledge of fluoride poisoning having worked with a leading expert in South Africa and on cases of animals affected by industrial fluoride poisoning in England. Taking his cue from Carson, Good disseminated what he called a “short story” about the incident to the press, putting across the Smarden incident as not simply a local industrial waste spill, but as deadly evidence of the pervasiveness of toxic pesticides in the environment. Acknowledging his inspiration, Good concluded his narrative by declaring that the “subject of Rachel Carson’s book Silent Spring had become a reality here in the heart of the Garden of England”. The media placed the Smarden incident within a Carson-inspired ecological critique of the dangers of an intensive, industrial approach to agriculture. Good, like Carson, was a trained scientist. Like her, he raised concerns about technocracy – governmental administration underpinned by scientific and technological expertise. As the Smarden incident unfolded, it highlighted the risks and hazards which accompanied the government’s commitment to industrial development. Tensions arose between veterinarians, government scientists, local government, media, and business interests. While the use of inorganic poisons as pesticides stretches back to antiquity, large-scale use of organic pesticides is a 20th-century phenomenon. Fluoroacetamide is a toxic organic pesticide with nefarious origins.  The two world wars fostered a massive growth of the chemical industry, and fluoroacetamide was a pesticide that arose from the search for lethal chemical weapons. After the war it was approved for use as a poison for use against rodents and insects – it was not uncommon for the science, technology, institutions, and language of chemical warfare to be redirected to the problem of agricultural pest control during peacetime. But by the time of the Smarden incident in the early 1960s, the origin of these chemicals was seen as damning evidence of the perniciousness of the military-industrial complex and its impact on the environment. Another case of fluoroacetamide poisonings, in Merthyr Tydfil, Wales, came to light in September 1963, in which contaminated pet food resulted in the death of 75 to 100 dogs and cats – effectively shifting fears from remote farmers’ fields into people’s homes. When the cows, dogs and guinea pigs used as subjects to test the extent of the environmental damage died, those fears grew. The government was consistently reluctant to inform the public about the strong circumstantial evidence of fluoroactemide poisoning. Declaring it a one-off industrial accident, the government avoided discussion of the actual widespread use of these chemicals as pesticides. But the death of further animals and a suspected case of human poisoning forced the government’s hand: on February 7, 1964, fluoroacetamide was banned as an insecticide. The government announced that 1,800 tonnes of polluted soil from the factory site would be removed and dumped at sea. Even so, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food did not permit farmers to use land around the site of the spill until March 1965, when government scientists found no traces of fluoroacetamide. Much like persistent pesticides, the Smarden incident lingered in people’s memories as a cautionary tale about science, government, and the industrialisation of agriculture. These memories resurfaced when in 1985 farmers at Smarden discovered the first case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in Kent and a number of further cases followed. Twelve years later, a perceived cluster of cases of new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) in the Smarden area led to speculation that this human form of BSE was caused by excessive exposure to pesticides. Reports in the press suggested that the residents of Smarden suspected the incident had been some sort of government-controlled experiment and subsequent cover-up which had produced BSE. While vCJD was subsequently tied to the practice of feeding cows meal containing infected cows’ meat, bone and brain matter, these environmental controversies ultimately made disputes among experts publicly visible, and this caused a significant change in the public’s perceptions of science. Smarden and its legacy drove the emergence of modern environmentalism in Britain, through a confluence of a concern for public health and animal welfare, the desire to conserve the countryside, and an emergent ecological approach – such as advanced by the Soil Association, founded in 1946. It also revealed the tension caused by conflicts between what we would now call environmentalism and scientific expertise in a modern world that now routinely deploys potentially life and planet-threatening technology. New activist movements have helped make contested expertise publicly visible, and this has contributed to an erosion of trust in traditional professions and in public authorities."
"The ascent is vertical. Up, up and into the jet stream. If the conditions are not right up there it will come back down and wait. But if there is a good tailwind in the right direction it will begin an epic journey that will take it around the curvature of the Earth; from the Arctic Circle to the southern hemisphere. Using the sun and stars as a compass, and navigating by the Earth’s magnetic field, recognising landmarks, the far eastern curlew will fly nonstop to the Yellow Sea, where it fuels up on the mudflats of north-east China.  Then it will fly through days and nights across oceans to reach the Australian coastline, an exhausted wreck of a bird that is down to skin and bones. An endurance athlete of the animal kingdom, an aerodynamic wonder, a bird that flies 30,000km a year, flapping its wings all the way because it can’t or soar or glide, the eastern curlew is a phenomenon of the natural world. It is also critically endangered. It has lost 80% of its population in the past 30 years. We don’t always see what is right in front of us. Tidal mudflats seem featureless, aesthetically disappointing, empty space, devoid of glossy breaking waves. But hidden beneath the mud they are fully functioning ecosystems of hundreds of species of invertebrates, crabs, shellfish and worms. Were it not for its preposterously long curving protuberance of a beak, you might not notice the brown speckled bird with that beak deep in the mud, feeding. The eastern curlew is the largest of more than 100 shorebirds that traverse the globe every year. They travel on one of nine invisible flyways that converge in the Arctic region. It is sometimes called the moonbird because if it lasts its 20-year lifespan it would have flown the distance between the Earth and the moon. Now, if a proposed development goes ahead on the mudflats at Toondah Harbour in Brisbane, the eastern curlew will, after flying 12,000km, arrive to find part of its habitat for six months each year taken over by a $1.4bn, 42-hectare marina and 3,500 apartment complex. Toondah is part of Moreton Bay, which is listed under the Ramsar convention on wetlands – an international treaty that protects important wetlands around the world. As well as 50,000 waterbirds, including 30 migratory species, it is the habitat of dugongs and turtles. For tens of thousands of years the eastern curlew has travelled on the east Asian-Australasian flyway to get here. Along with 55 other migratory species it passes through 22 countries along the way. The flyways – super highways – take birds to Africa, Europe, the Americas. Says Randall Wood, a director who is travelling and researching Flyways, a film about globally migrating shorebirds: “The birds link all those countries. It is a beautiful story of resilience, endurance and versatility.” The world record for marathon flying is now held by the smaller bar-tailed godwit, which has been tracked travelling 11,000km from Alaska to New Zealand at an average of 50km/h, in a big arc and without stopping, in only eight days. “Fuel is stored in the body as fat,” Wood says. “They use a combination of fat and animo acid drawn from muscle depletion, so they are literally digesting their muscles on route. What [scientists] are not sure about is how they are able to fly as far as they do with the fuel that they have got. The math doesn’t add up. It is known that the eastern curlew shrivels organs like its reproductive system, which it doesn’t use while flying, to almost nothing to save a few grams of weight. Harry Saddler, who wrote the book The Eastern Curlew, says: “Before they leave they will feed frantically and put on 80% of their bodyweight again in fat. When they are getting ready to fly they are like balloons that are bursting and you wonder how they can get off the ground.” Migrating birds’ ability to predict long-term weather forecasts, says Wood, “is better than the very, very best computer models we have got. They can tell months out when a storm is going to come. They will actually time their departures to literally slingshot themselves out to sea on the tail of a storm and propel themselves across oceans.”  A whimbrel, says Amanda Lilleyman, a research associate at Charles Darwin University, was “tracked moving 200km out of the way of the eye of the cyclone before the cyclone hit”. As eastern curlews get ready to leave for their breeding grounds in Siberia in April, their plumage change. “They get these fresh flight feathers to take them back up north,” says Lilleyman. They will also be growing brighter feathers to attract mates. Having gone to all the trouble of the energy-intensive migration to Siberia, says Saddler, “They get straight down to business because they are only there for six weeks. The male tries to impress the female by doing 15-metre-high flights while calling the whole time.” The chicks feed themselves from the moment they are hatched and are start their first migration at six weeks. It is what they face on their migration that gives us the bird’s eye view of the world we have created. “Many scientists call the eastern curlew a sentinel species,” Wood says. “They are telling us about the state of the world globally in ways that many other species just aren’t.  “Shorebirds face a perfect storm. They are facing compounding impacts from climate change, extensive coastal development, extreme habitat loss, the rise of megacities in Asia, light pollution, wind turbines, pesticide use on broad-acre farms, hunters who shoot them, and competing with farmers for water.” The climate crisis has taken its toll on another shorebird, the great knot, whose numbers have been getting smaller and smaller. “Because,” says Saddler, “the Arctic summer begins three weeks earlier than it used to. They are still flying to their traditional timetable but, by the time they get up there, the insect boom has been and gone. The chicks hatch and there is not enough food so they are malnourished, they don’t grow as large, the bills don’t grow as long.  “So when they eventually manage to migrate and get to the mudflat to refuel and feed, they can’t reach the depth of the clams any more, so they feed on roots and plants which are much less nutritious. It just has this cascading effect down the line.” The most endangered bird of all is the tiny spoon-billed sandpiper, which travels down from Russia to Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia. It is thought that there are just 200 breeding pairs left. One weather event on its way and it will be gone forever. “These birds aren’t going to be saved by captivity,” Saddler says, “because they are hardwired to fly 10,000km a year.” The flyways are only as strong as their weakest link. “Every country on the migration route is in the chain,” Saddler sats. “It doesn’t matter if one link in the chain is strong, if another link is smashed there is no chain any more.” And the weakest link is Australia. Like Toondah Harbour, Lake Wollumboola on the south coast of New South Wales is an internationally significant site that is slated for rezoning – into a development of a possible 600 homes. “Eastern curlews are extraordinary creatures and the fact that we are allowing this species to go extinct under our watch is a total violation of the treaty,” Wood says. The eastern curlew is very site-specific; it always returns to the same place. When South Korea built the world’s longest seawall, Saddler says: “It killed the entire estuary. The birds didn’t go somewhere else, they landed where the estuary should have been and the food was no longer there and they died. When they land they simply don’t have the energy left to go to other food sources. With that one construction the great knot went from least concern to endangered.” Every time one is frightened into flight by a human or a dog, Saddler says, that “is a wingbeat that is robbed from the upcoming migration. They don’t wander around because they need to save all the energy they can get.” Even China, Saddler says, after many years of rapacious development and land reclamation, has “had a huge turn of attitude. China has got a new green policy. They have just had huge swathes of land nominated for world heritage status on the coast. They are forging ahead with the conservation movement in China – we are stepping in the opposite direction.” He adds: “This perpetual growth model of the economy is fundamentally incompatible with life on Earth.” There are estimated to be about 25,000 eastern curlews left which, given the dangers they face migrating, is not a lot. But everyone, Saddler says, including scientists around the world, “who is working on shorebirds is deeply and extraordinarily passionate about them”. Says Wood: “We think we can lose a species here and there and perhaps we can but what they are actually showing us is a barometer of global health – and we ignore that at our peril. There is a ticking clock here and it is an extinction story and we are marching towards it.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterYesterday I posted on a new study from Nicola Scafetta, which found indications that the sun plays a far greater role in climate change and that CO2 climate sensitivity is pegged too high.
A number of large studies have come out over the last couple of years and months showing the same. No wonder the IPCC is under pressure to scale back its projected temperature rise by the year 2100.
The Economist here has seen an unpublished draft copy of the 5th Assessment Report. Some excerpts from the Economist article (my emphasis):
According to one table from the unpublished report, which was seen by The Economist (above), at CO2 concentrations of between 425 parts per million and 485 ppm, temperatures in 2100 would be 1.3-1.7°C above their pre-industrial levels. That seems lower than the IPCC’s previous assessment, made in 2007. […]
It is clear that some IPCC scientists think the projected rise in CO2 levels might not have such a big warming effect as was once thought.

In the new draft, the lower end of the range has been reduced to 1.5°C and the “most likely” figure has been scrapped. That seems to reflect a growing sense that climate sensitivity may have been overestimated in the past and that the science is too uncertain to justify a single estimate of future rises. If this does turn out to be the case, it would have significant implications for policy.”

Of course the IPCC will continue to insist that a catastrophe is coming, unless we hand the reigns of power and decision-making over to environmental elitists. It’ll be interesting to see if they disappear the following graphic, which appeared in a leaked draft late last year:
 
My bet is that it will not see the light of day in the final report. The 5th assessment report will be the IPCC’s last chance.

By now, well informed people are aware that there has been no warming for the last 16 or so years. Why should this be if CO2 has increased by 8% in that time? We are told by 97% of climate researchers, that CO2 doubling must warm us by 2 to 4.5 degrees C, so that 8% increase should have resulted in something like 0.2 to 0.3° C warming in the last two decades. Despite the best efforts of the data manipulators, that hasn’t happened. What is going on?
It has not occurred to many researchers that climate sensitivity to CO2 is not a constant. As Willis Eschenbach has pointed out in several articles, here, here, here, and most importantly, here, climate sensitivity is variable over short times, long times, and areas. It varies by time of day, being high in the morning when the sun is warming the atmosphere at the highest rate, and lower in the afternoon when rising air results in cumulus clouds and thunderstorms. It varies by latitude, being low or even negative in the tropics, where there are more thunderstorms, and higher at mid-latitudes. It is generally higher over land than over oceans, though there are extremely negative local spots over some tropical rain forests.

Figure 1 from Willis Eschenbach here.
Climate sensitivity also seems to be variable over long time scales. We know that both CO2 and water vapor are involved in the process, and we know that the effect of both is logarithmic. For CO2, as it increases in the atmosphere, the effect becomes less and less. Most of the greenhouse effect takes place at concentrations less than 200 ppm.
We also know that atmospheric humidity has been decreasing as CO2 is increasing, offsetting CO2 warming with water vapor cooling.

Figure 2: CO2 and humidity over time (600 mbar altitude).
If we let MODTRAN calculate the resulting outbound long wave radiation (OLR) we see why we had cooling in the 60’s and 70’s and warming in the 80’s and 90’s. We also see the leveling in the last decade.

Figure 3: Computed OLR inverted so that warming is upward and cooling downward.
This decrease in humidity has more than offset the increase in CO2 and has decreased the climate sensitivity due to CO2 over time. This is also seen in computations of climate sensitivity versus temperature.

Figure 4: Computation of climate sensitivity from CO2 change and temperature change over 60-year time intervals to bridge AMO/PDO cycles.
Figure 4 shows that climate sensitivity has dropped from the 3 to 4°C per CO2 doubling range in the mid-20th century to below 2°C in the 1980’s, and to the 1.6 to 1.7°C range seen today. This explains the range and decreasing values seen in recent attempts to measure climate sensitivity. Water vapor is the thermostat, not CO2.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThere’s a lot going on today as the IPCC continues to clash violently with climate reality.
We’ve always suspected that governments had contracted out the results to begin with. In the beginning, the scientists played along. After all the observations nicely followed the model projections for almost 2 decades. But the wanted results are no longer possible to deliver and the observations have long since diverged from the model projections. Now bitter disputes are breaking out between client and provider as a result.
Today Axel Bojanowski at Spiegel here reports:
Dispute with scientists […] Against the will of many scientists, especially delegates of the German government want to keep the pause in global warming of the last 15 years out of the IPCC Report’s summary.”
Hat tip: Ike.
Obviously “many scientists” are starting to have serious second thoughts and are getting queasy about assuming the role of science prostitute, assigned by sleazy pimping governments. This is understandable for any self-respecting scientist. After all, who is ready to go down in history as purchased whore, crackpot scientist?
Bureaucrats schooling experts on what the results are

Picture this: What we have are German politicians from the Ministry of Environment, who have little science background, literally schooling the expert scientists on what the results should be and which ones are important. What’s now happening in Stockholm is the brazen politicization and corruption of science. The picture speaks for itself. That’s why I write using the crude analogies of pimps and (potential) whores.
SPIEGEL writes:
Leading scientists are contradicting the political delegates. Jochem Marotzke, President of the German Climate Consortium and the leading scientific representative at the negotiations in Stockholm promises: ‘We are going to confront this issue head on.’ The UN IPCC has to accept a discussion about the temperature stop.”
New SPIEGEL survey: only 39% fear global warming!
The SPIEGEL report in general conveys a growing sense of desperation among German delegates. The flagship news magazine writes of waning public concern when it comes to climate change, writing of a “dramatic change in public opinion” shown by a new survey commissioned by SPIEGEL:
Germans no longer have any fear of the impacts of climate change. While in 2006 a clear majority of Germans (62 percent) feared global warming, now it’s only a minority of 39 percent.”

"When we hear about the horrors of industrial livestock farming – the pollution, the waste, the miserable lives of billions of animals – it is hard not to feel a twinge of guilt and conclude that we should eat less meat.  Yet most of us probably won’t. Instead, we will mumble something about meat being tasty, that “everyone” eats it, and that we only buy “grass fed” beef.  Over the next year, more than 50 billion land animals will be raised and slaughtered for food around the world. Most of them will be reared in conditions that cause them to suffer unnecessarily while also harming people and the environment in significant ways.  This raises serious ethical problems. We’ve compiled a list of arguments against eating meat to help you decide for yourself what to put on your plate. Livestock farming has a vast environmental footprint. It contributes to land and water degradation, biodiversity loss, acid rain, coral reef degeneration and deforestation.  Nowhere is this impact more apparent than climate change – livestock farming contributes 18% of human produced greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. This is more than all emissions from ships, planes, trucks, cars and all other transport put together.  Climate change alone poses multiple risks to health and well-being through increased risk of extreme weather events – such as floods, droughts and heatwaves – and has been described as the greatest threat to human health in the 21st century. Reducing consumption of animal products is essential if we are to meet global greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets – which are necessary to mitigate the worst effects of climate change.  Meat production is highly inefficient – this is particularly true when it comes to red meat. To produce one kilogram of beef requires 25 kilograms of grain – to feed the animal – and roughly 15,000 litres of water. Pork is a little less intensive and chicken less still.  The scale of the problem can also be seen in land use: around 30% of the earth’s land surface is currently used for livestock farming. Since food, water and land are scarce in many parts of the world, this represents an inefficient use of resources.  Feeding grain to livestock increases global demand and drives up grain prices, making it harder for the world’s poor to feed themselves. Grain could instead be used to feed people, and water used to irrigate crops.  If all grain were fed to humans instead of animals, we could feed an extra 3.5 billion people. In short, industrial livestock farming is not only inefficient but also not equitable. If we accept, as many people do, that animals are sentient creatures whose needs and interests matter, then we should ensure these needs and interests are at least minimally met and that we do not cause them to suffer unnecessarily.  Industrial livestock farming falls well short of this minimal standard. Most meat, dairy and eggs are produced in ways that largely or completely ignore animal welfare – failing to provide sufficient space to move around, contact with other animals, and access to the outdoors.  In short, industrial farming causes animals to suffer without good justification. At the production level, industrial livestock farming relies heavily on antibiotic use to accelerate weight gain and control infection – in the US, 80% of all antibiotics are consumed by the livestock industry.  This contributes to the growing public health problem of antibiotic resistance. Already, more than 23,000 people are estimated to die every year in the US alone from resistant bacteria. As this figure continues to rise, it becomes hard to overstate the threat of this emerging crisis.  High meat consumption – especially of red and processed meat – typical of most rich industrialised countries is linked with poor health outcomes, including heart disease, stroke, diabetes and various cancers.  These diseases represent a major portion of the global disease burden so reducing consumption could offer substantial public health benefits.  Currently, the average meat intake for someone living in a high-income country is 200-250g a day, far higher than the 80-90g recommended by the United Nations. Switching to a more plant-based diet could save up to 8m lives a year worldwide by 2050 and lead to healthcare related savings and avoided climate change damages of up to $1.5 trillion.  Most people agree that as a basic rule an action that promotes the overall happiness of others is morally good, while an action that causes harm or suffering without good justification is morally wrong.  Meat eating is wrong not because there is something special about pigs or chickens or dogs or cats, but because of the harm it causes, whether that harm is caused to animals, humans, or the wider environment.  Most people living in industrialised countries have historically unprecedented dietary choice. And if our nutritional needs can now be met by consuming foods that are less harmful, then we ought to choose these over foods that are known to cause more harm.  Eating less meat and animal products is one of the easiest things we can do to live more ethically."

"The Morrison government has quietly appointed an expert panel to come up with new ways to cut greenhouse gas emissions and given it less than a month to come up with recommendations. In what is being seen by observers as an acknowledgment that its main climate change policy, the $2.55bn emissions reduction fund, is failing to cut national pollution, the government has appointed a panel of four business leaders and policy experts to suggest options to expand it. The panel is headed by Grant King, the outgoing president of the Business Council of Australia and a former chief executive of Origin Energy. It was appointed by the minister for emissions reduction, Angus Taylor, in mid-October but has not been made public. Business sources say the Morrison government, via officials, has been privately sounding out various groups about an overhaul of the fund for months. But stakeholders were taken aback when the King panel approached them to provide detailed comments on options in less than two weeks. A letter from King to interest groups, seen by Guardian Australia, apologises implicitly for the compressed timeframe, acknowledging “it may not be possible to fully consult across your membership before providing your response”. But he argues there will be time for follow-up discussions as a final report is prepared. The letter was sent with a discussion paper headed “Expert panel examining opportunities for further abatement” that critiques and sets out options “to enhance” the fund. The panel has been established despite Morrison and Taylor maintaining they have set out “to the last tonne” of carbon dioxide how Australia will meet the 2030 emissions target announced before the Paris climate conference. In reality, national emissions have risen each year since 2015 and most analyses suggest the government will not reach the goal, a 26%-28% cut below 2005 levels, under current policies. The discussion paper, first reported by Footprint, says the emissions reduction fund has been successful in generating carbon offsets from native vegetation and landfill projects, largely because they cost relatively little and do not require businesses to make substantial operational changes. But it says the scheme has done little to cut emissions through energy efficiency projects and from industry, agriculture and transport, in part due to high upfront and transaction costs. The emissions reduction fund works as a reverse auction, rewarding landowners and businesses that make cheap, viable bids for taxpayers’ support to cut pollution. The most recent auction bought emissions cuts equivalent to only 0.01% of Australia’s annual greenhouse gas pollution after officials found just three projects worth backing. The paper says the government is looking at ways to attract more participants from industry and agricultural businesses. It is also considering new incentives to complement the fund, including partnerships with other tiers of government and the private sector and reconsidering how to best spend “existing financing resources”. Those resources include an additional $2bn committed to the fund before the election (when the government rebranded it as part of what it calls a climate solutions fund) and money allocated to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. Possible emissions reduction options listed include: Changing the scheme known as the safeguard mechanism, which was supposed to limit emissions from big industry but in practice has allowed pollution to increase, so companies that emit less than their limit are awarded carbon credits they could sell to the government or business. Companies now have limits based on emissions intensity (how much they emit for every dollar earned) rather than outright pollution. Offering companies cash to help pay for technology-focused emissions reduction projects that would otherwise struggle to be financially viable. Boosting energy efficiency by giving smaller operators better access to expert advice and providing incentives to reduce energy use in commercial buildings and low-income housing. There is a view among some stakeholders that the Morrison government is trying to pull together a policy reboot before a meeting of energy ministers at the Council of Australian Governments energy council in November. The meeting has been delayed for months because of wrangling among the participants. Guardian Australia revealed in August that the New South Wales government had asked Canberra to provide an alternative to the dumped national energy guarantee. It would see the Morrison government underwrite both new generation to replace the Liddell power station, probably firmed renewables, and new investments in transmission. Energy stakeholders are speculating that some states may also pursue money from the fund to drive abatement . In response to questions about the panel, Taylor said the environment department and expert panel were working together to ensure the $2bn climate solutions fund would deliver the most emissions abatement possible. He said the commonwealth conservatively estimated the fund would deliver at least 103m tonnes of cuts by 2030. “This is a minimum target, not a cap,” he said. Interest groups were asked to give quick feedback last week before the panel submits advice to Taylor next month. The other panel members are Susie Smith, chief executive of the Australian Industry Greenhouse Network, Prof Andrew Macintosh, head of the Emissions Reduction Assurance Committee, and David Parker, the Clean Energy Regulator chairman. The fund has faced consistent criticism since it replaced the Gillard-era carbon pricing scheme. A Guardian Australia investigation found while the type of vegetation projects it supports were worthwhile it was often difficult to know what taxpayers were getting for their money. There have been problems with how emissions cuts from some projects have been calculated and some methodologies have paid for cuts that would have happened anyway. Others have supported fossil fuel projects. The government has also been criticised for planning to reduce the difficulty of meeting its 2030 target by using what are known as “carryover credits”, which it has claimed for Australia surpassing the targets it set under the Kyoto protocol (an 8% increase in emissions between 1990 and 2012, and a 5% reduction between 2000 and 2020). The environment department has conceded it is not aware of any other country planning to use carryover credits to meet a target under the Paris agreement."

Share this...FacebookTwitterI watched the following  Greenpeace video clip of Camila Speziale, the youngest of the 30 Greenpeace activists. I really wonder if Greenpeace is getting the message at all.

I found it peculiar that at the end of the video Greenpeace added the text (my emphasis): “Camila is one of the 30 activists taken captive when Russian authorities stormed the Arctic Sunrise on September 19.”

When Greenpeace illegally trespasses onto a facility and rams the boats of authorities, they insist it’s “peaceful protest”. But when Russian authorities arrest activists for breaking the law, Greenpeace describes the Russian authorities as “taking captives”…like hostage takers holding people illegally. A rather hostile and confrontational choice of words by Greenpeace lawyers, I’d say.
Greenpeace seems to be confused about who the accused criminals are and who the law-enforcement authorities are.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe preliminary results of Germany’s national election are rolling in. What’s sure is that Angela Merkel’s conservative CDU/CSU party is the winner, with projections showing them currently capturing a massive 42.5% of the votes.

Preliminary, early results show the Greens (Grüne) collapsing to 8% (2009: 11%) thus eliminating the possibility of a socialist/green coalition government made up of the SPD/Greens. Source: www.tagesschau.de
The Green Party is among the big losers, with early projections showing them picking up only 8% of the vote. In 2009 they received almost 11%.
With climate change losing importance in Germany as an issue and the Energiewende (transition to renewable energy) turning into a chaos that threatens the country’s economic stability, the Greens, who were polling near 16% earlier in the year, have since lost almost half of their voter base.
In a reaction to the preliminary results, Green Party co-leader Katrin Göring-Eckardt said on ARD television that they “failed to convince voters of an ecological transition and sustainability“.
The element of fear, which the Greens have always effectively used in the past to motivate its voter base, was absent during the campaign as the issues of nuclear power and climate change didn’t play a role.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Resonator, the research podcast of the German Helmholtz Research Group conducted a long interview (1 hr 40 min!) with climate scientist Hans von Storch director of the GKSS Research Center. In the interview von Storch was asked about his views on a wide variety of climate science related issues.
Hat-tip: klimazwiebel.
Overall the interview saw a Hans von Storch who spoke frankly and openly. Some of the remarks he made raised my eye brows. In general von Storch, best described as a non-alarmist warmist, views the climate debate as being dominated by the more extreme positions from both sides, with voices in the middle getting drowned out. He levels a fair amount of criticism at the climate science community, but does so without naming any persons in particular.
Due to the sheer length of the interview, I will only look at the points that I found interesting and relevant as skeptic.
Scientists too quick to accept dramatic scenarios
At the 15-minute mark von Storch describes a science that is so politicized with both sides are trying to make it black and white, and a debate that has been overly shrill. Some scientists, he says, have tended to accept dramatic scenarios and consequences even when there’s little evidence behind them. He also talks of a group of scientists who fancy themselves as the ultimate authority and who have the last word. All the exaggerations and projections of doom, gloom and disaster have led to an overall discrediting of the field.
“Science and Nature are pretty bad journals”
At the 29-minute mark von Storch says he sees himself as someone who needs a lot of time before he is convinced of anything. I was surprised to hear him call both Science and Nature “pretty bad journals” when it comes to the quality of their articles. Hans von Storch cites an article published by Science claiming that the climate was going to tip in the year 2047, calling the report “a real doozy“. He says that science journals must remain sufficiently critical and not let themselves get caught up with the zeitgeist. Von Storch admits that he has not always been popular among the community.
Overall von Storch doesn’t blame the media much for the hysteria, implying that the hysteria stems more from scientists communicating poorly. The media are only interpreting what the scientists are spewing. Projections of snowless winters, for example, were hardly helpful in lending credibility to climate science.
Scientists dramatizing for attention and prestige

At the 37-minute mark von Storch believes some scientists succumbed to drama in order to get attention and prestige, and says that the such are only damaging the credibility of climate science.
Models too CO2-centric
At the 40-minute mark von Storch discusses possible reasons why the warming has stalled and thinks other explanations need to be examined, such as solar activity and aerosols. He finds climate models too CO2-centric in general. Here he appeals for more patience to let the science unfold.
At the 45 minute mark he fires harsh criticism at scientists who promote a society governed by an elite technocracy, calling the idea “stupidity”. He calls the proposals made by a group of scientists in favor of appointing future councils to represent the interests of future generations “peculiar”.
At the 59-minute mark, on whether storms are becoming more frequent and severe, von Storch says he doesn’t think this is the case and that the disasters are more about the over-development of coastal areas.
Hockey stick was “something dumb” – an attempt to steer politics
On the hockey stick chart, at the 63 minute mark, von Storch has some blunt words on how it was possible for it to become the icon it became. He recalls having examined the chart himself and finding it deficient.
I believe it was something dumb by scientists who wanted to steer politics.”
He thinks the climate science community were too quick to call it the last word. Hans von Storch sees critique of the hockey stick and confirmed and that’s why it no longer appears in the IPCC reports. Scientists, von Storch reminds us, should not be so quick to claim absolute truth.
Also, von Storch believes that the oceans could be warming up, but that there is very little data out there to confirm it.

"Phosphorus is an essential element which is contained in many cellular compounds, such as DNA and the energy carrier ATP. All life needs phosphorus and agricultural yields are improved when phosphorus is added to growing plants and the diet of livestock. Consequently, it is used globally as a fertiliser – and plays an important role in meeting the world’s food requirements. In order for us to add it, however, we first need to extract it from a concentrated form – and the supply comes almost exclusively from phosphate mines in Morocco (with far smaller quantities coming from China, the US, Jordan and South Africa). Within Morocco, most of the mines are in Western Sahara, a former Spanish colony which was annexed by Morocco in 1975.  The fact that more than 70% of the global supply comes from this single location is problematic, especially as scientists are warning that we are approaching “peak phosphorous”, the point at which demand begins to outstrip supply and intensive agriculture cannot continue to provide current yields. In the worst case scenario, mineable reserves could be exhausted within as little as 35 years. So what is going on – and how worried should be? In nature, phosphorus only exists bound to oxygen, which is called phosphate. It is in this form that it is mined. Chemists can remove the oxygens bound to it to get elemental white phosphorus, which glows in the dark, but it is so unstable that it spontaneously ignites on exposure to air. Phosphate easily diffuses through soil or water and can be taken up by cells. When phosphate meets free calcium or iron, they combine to give highly insoluble salts.  In the first half of the 19th century, Justus von Liebig popularised the law of the minimum for agriculture, which states that growth is limited by the least available resource. It was soon discovered that this was often some form of phosphorus. As a consequence, bones – comprised mostly of calcium and phosphate – from old battlefields were dug up to use in farming. Guano, large accumulations of bird droppings, also contains high concentrations of phosphorus and was used to fertilise crops. But supplies of this were soon depleted. As demand increased, supplies had to be mined instead. But this applied inorganic phosphate fertiliser is highly mobile and leaches into watercourses. In addition, phosphate rock weathers and is also ultimately washed into the ocean where it either deposits as calcium phosphate or is taken up by marine organisms who also eventually deposit on the ocean floor when they die. Consequently, terrestrial phosphorous doesn’t really disappear, but it can move beyond our reach. To complicate matters further, even the phosphorous we can use is largely wasted. Of the phosphorus mined as fertiliser, only a fifth reaches the food we eat. Some leaches away and some is bound to calcium and iron in the soil. Some plant roots have the ability to extract the latter, but not in large enough quantities to retrieve all of it.  In addition to these inorganic forms, phosphate is also converted into cellular compounds, creating organically-bound phosphorus, such as phospholipids or phytate. After the death of an organism, these organic phosphorus compounds need to be returned into the useable phosphate form. How much organically-bound phosphorus is present in soils depends on the number and activity of the organisms that can do this. Agricultural soils are usually rich in inorganic phosphorous while in undisturbed ecosystems, such as forests and long-term pastures, organically-bound phosphorus dominates. But agricultural land is often depleted of phosphorus during harvest and land management practises such as ploughing, hence the addition of phosphate-containing fertilisers.  Spreading manure and avoiding tillage are ways of increasing microbial abundance in the soil – and so keeping more phosphorus in an organically-bound form.  The risks of peak phosphorous can be countered with some simple solutions. Eating less meat is a start as huge amounts are used to rear livestock for meat. The chances are that agricultural yields are limited by phosphorus availability and will be further stretched as the global population grows.  Humans are themselves wasteful of phosphorous, as most of what we take in goes straight out again. Fortunately, technologies have been developed to mine phosphorus from sewage, but at present are too expensive to be practical.  Peak phosphorus does not mean that phosphorus will disappear, rather that the reserves with mineable high concentrations are depleting. Instead, we are increasing the background concentrations of phosphorus and adding it to the ocean floor. More sustainable phosphorus use requires a greater appreciation and understanding of the many organisms that make up soils – and the part they play in phosphorus distribution – or we may no longer be able to feed the world at an affordable price."
"Chile’s decision to withdraw as host of the COP 25 UN climate conference has prompted tears and frustration from a group of school-strike activists sailing across the Atlantic to attend the talks.  But the young campaigners say they are determined to continue their journey to hold other civil society meetings in South America, and may only consider charting a new course if the United Nations accepts Spain’s offer to act as an emergency host of the summit. The shock announcement by the Chilean president, Sebastián Piñera, was the latest in a series of setbacks for the 36 young European campaigners on board the Regina Maris sailboat, which left Amsterdam on 2 October. The vessel had to make an unexpected stop in France because of problems with the water purification system. The weather has been rough and several passengers were seasick, including 18-year-old Adelaïde Charlier, a co-organiser with Anuna De Wever of the Youth for Climate movement in Belgium. News of the cancellation of the Santiago summit reportedly came as a heavy blow to the activists, some of whom have also endured online trolling and death threats, during the past year. “Quite a number of people started to cry, including Anuna and Adelaide,” De Wever’s mother, Katrien Van der Heyden, said. “They’d been planning this trip for months and the COP would be the ultimate climax of their trip. Obviously this changes the entire perspective of what they do, and is extremely disappointing.” But the group discussed the options and decided to push ahead. “We are continuing our journey to Belém, Brasil today, while our thoughts are with #Chile!” they tweeted. 📢UPDATE: We are continuing our journey to Belém, Brasil today, while our thoughts are with #Chile! 🌊🌊From there we can still make it to a #COP25 held in Costa Rica or Bonn, most likely options at the moment. #ClimateAction is unstoppable! 🌏 pic.twitter.com/DP7u9TYYYh “From there we can still make it to a #COP25 held in Costa Rica or Bonn, most likely options at the moment. #ClimateAction is unstoppable!”  They are not the only activists who have sailed the Atlantic to attend the talks and then been left in limbo while the UN attempts to reorganise the event. The Swedish climate campaigner Greta Thunberg is currently in Los Angeles and was due to sail to Chile shortly. On Friday she appealed for a lift back to Europe by sea, tweeting: “It turns out I’ve traveled half around the world, the wrong way:) Now I need to find a way to cross the Atlantic in November … If anyone could help me find transport I would be so grateful.” She continued: “I’m so sorry I’ll not be able to visit South and Central America this time, I was so looking forward to this. But this is of course not about me, my experiences or where I wish to travel. We’re in a climate and ecological emergency.” The British film-maker James Levelle is halfway through a 100-day, 7,000-mile fossil-free journey to Santiago. Supporters say he may not even be aware that the climate summit has been cancelled. Other climate groups are also reeling from the immense financial hit of non-refundable airline tickets and the complications of getting visas to a new venue. “We had big plans to bring indigenous representatives and partners to the summit,” said Nicole Oliveira, Latin America team leader of 350.org, which planned to bring about 60 people to a climate defenders gathering ahead of the summit, in addition to 16 staff and a dozen other regional partners. The group says the cost of airfares and accommodation could double if the climate conference moves to Spain – which would eat up 10-15% of their budget for the event. “What may not mean anything to the large corporations of the fossil fuel industry, to us as non-profit civil society organizations – and even more to the indigenous organizations – can often represent our survival as active agents of change,” Oliveira said. “We expect now that the climate talks move forward with a new focus on public participation and human rights. For far too long, this process has prioritized the voices of big business and corporate polluters. The UN must kick the fossil fuel industry out of the climate talks and make more space for the voices of the people.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Moscow Times here writes that a Russian court has denied the Greenpeace activists bail, and the prospect of spending a long time in a Russian prison is increasingly becoming a grim reality. But unlike in the past, Greenpeace is now also being sharply criticized worldwide.
The English-language Voice of Russia aims harsh criticism at Greenpeace, writing that “experts doubt the adequacy and altruism of that international organization“.
The first thing that jumps out at you in the Voice of Russia article is the photo of Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise. The front is completely bent in. Have they been engaging in a little ramming lately? Some excerpts from the Voice of Russia (my emphasis):
The Western press launched a loud campaign in support of the Greenpeace. But many experts not to mention ordinary people call the actions of the activists ecological extremism. Here is the view of the situation of Mikhail Voytenko, the editor-in-chief of the Maritime Bulletin:
Everybody was afraid of getting involved with the Greenpeace, starting with corporations and ending with whole countries. And now it encountered somebody who did not get scared. And it is now getting its due. […] In reality, the Greenpeace is a dubious organization, which frequently uses illegal methods in quite different countries. […] On the whole it is practically an extremist organization.”
Voice of Russia quotes Ortis Andres Carlos, an Argentinian expert in economics and energy, a PhD in economics, is of a similar opinion:
It was a real attack on the Russian platform, the activists acted very roughly and provocatively. To call things their names, we are talking about «ecological terrorism». Greenpeace activists are a lot more interested in creating a social response.”

Meanwhile The Mirror here reports that arrested British journalist Keiron Bryan has gotten a letter out to the media in which he expresses real fear of what lies ahead. The Mirror writes: “…he fears a long jail sentence” and that he is feeling “horrible uncertainty and anxiety“. He believes that those arrested were “pieces in a game we didn’t want to  participate in“. Obviously Keiron and the activists initially thought they’d be handled with kids’ gloves, maybe spend a night in jail before strutting out the next day in the limelight of the big sympathetic media. Instead they are now staring at a Russian judge through the bars of a cage.
The biggest problem for the two journalists is the mountain of incriminating evidence Russian authorities likely have seized. All the computers and their contents in the form of e-mails, comments, documents etc. will tell if the journalists were truly objectively reporting, or if they were acting as powerful media representatives aiding and abetting the cause. One gets the sense that Greenpeace hired the journalists for the very purpose of high powered promotion.
“Chilly attitude towards suffering humanity”
Today the Mail Online has a story that is also highly critical of the environmental organization. It writes that the international organization “has a  decidedly chilly attitude towards suffering humanity. It has led a campaign to harass and frustrate ‘the Golden Rice Project’, a not-for-profit scheme backed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation“. The Mail writes regarding Greenpeace’s overzealous opposition to the testing of gene modified foods (GMOs): “… it destroys such tests physically, thus showing its fundamental contempt for the scientific method”. In short: Luddites.
Now the reality and the gravity of the situation is dawning on the activists. They are in deep trouble. You can almost see what’s coming ahead: a process involving damning evidence, a harsh sentence, followed by tears and sadness, then by anger and rebellion – and maybe later a hunger strike. That will all pass, however. And after a year or two of deep reflection and thought in their cells, many will probably realize that they indeed had been on an out-of control path and that they had it coming. After a couple of years of good behavior, they’ll be back out on their feet- very likely a whole lot wiser and far less naïve about the world-saving cause they had been indoctrinated with by Greenpeace and its directors.
Also read here: “…either willing participants or unwitting pawns.”

"The idea of a single building where you live, work and play may seem very much of the moment, driven by advances in communications technology. But mixed-use developments have been around for as long as mankind. Research has revealed that complex cave systems hosted multiple uses hundreds of thousands of years ago. The Romans built large multi-use complexes across their empire. And during medieval times, people used to manufacture, sell and live in the same building.  It wasn’t until the industrial revolution that industry and trade were separated from homes. Advances in mechanical and agricultural technologies brought on board processes that were highly toxic and dirty, while instances of plague and infestation grew, as larger volumes of food were stored to feed a growing urban population. Large-scale industrial automation also required special access and ample spaces to accommodate large and noisy machinery and production systems. To address these issues, cities around the world began to segregate uses, by either locating different functions in separate buildings, or through the regulatory zoning of land.  Much has changed since industrial times. The gradual move from a “manufacturing” to a “services” era, the growth of specialised fields of expertise and advances in communication have all meant that organisations could operate at a smaller scale, giving more people the opportunity to work from home.  What’s more, sustainability has become an increasingly important consideration over the past few decades. As a growing body of research shows that flexible spaces can be more economically viable and land efficient, mixed use schemes are gaining popularity once more. In some countries,legislation and financial incentives embrace the view that all different aspects of life can successfully be performed at a local level, in a shared place.  But making the switch back to mixed use isn’t quite so simple. Growing population densities in cities, intricate property ownership models and the need to share limited land resources all present a challenge to changing the way people live and work.  Urban designers must relearn how to allocate different activities and various levels of privacy within one space, while resolving all the increasingly complex technicalities of contemporary city life. Perhaps the biggest challenge for architects and designers is having to learn to work in parallel with other fields of expertise. Fortunately, technology has come to the rescue, with new communication tools and software solutions that allow everyone involved to work simultaneously on one shared design model. While still in the transition phase, architects are acknowledging and embracing the changes required.  But there are other reasons why the changes in building patterns have been slow. There is still a public perception that living in a purely residential area is desirable.  For one thing, there’s a widespread misconception that residential suburbia, with trees and front gardens, but segregated from the main city and its services, equates to the garden city, historically regarded as a healthier living option. In fact, the garden city was initially designed so that residents could have easy access to local jobs and essential services through a highly connected “urban economy” system. This misunderstanding prevents many from appreciating the benefits of healthier and more flexible ways to inhabit our planet.  People don’t like the idea of sharing their residential spaces with industrial and commercial uses. Issues such as noise, smells and loss of privacy prevent some buyers from investing in mixed use schemes. But this tendency is gradually changing. Examples across the globe are showing that living, working, socialising and entertaining locally has multiple benefits such as shorter commuting times and a more active and engaged social life. This is true in both large cities and lower density areas.  What’s more, mixed use developments can help residents to establish frequent contact and long term relationships with others. Virtual reality and global communication systems are connecting people around the world. But they also detach people from those they are closest to. A built environment that keeps people together and offers more opportunities to meet could mitigate this problem.  Lives are becoming more fused, and the boundaries between family life, social life and work, are gradually disintegrating. In response, the built environment must adapt, offering greater flexibility and efficiency, while helping citizens to reach for a richer, healthier, happier future."

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman online Spektrum.de science magazine conducted an in-depth interview with two leading international climate scientists, Professor Mojib Latif and Professor Hans von Storch.
For the record, both now concede that global temperatures have indeed defied the vast array of (expensive) model projections and have not gone up in 15 years. Now more than ever before they are forced to concede that the models have been giving CO2 too much weight as a climate driver.
But Latif, who 10 years ago predicted Europe would hardly see snow and frost in the wintertime, now claims that he “isn’t at all surprised in any way by the warming hiatus” (and that all the models have been wrong). To his credit, Latif in the past predicted that ocean cycles needed to be better taken into account and that the warming would pause due to ocean cycles.
Hans von Storch, on the other hand, says he is surprised by the stalled warming: “It hasn’t gotten as warm as we expected. […] We really have to think about whether or not our models can really project the future development.”
Too much complexity and uncertainty
Spektrum then asked if the scientists perhaps overestimated CO2. The warmist Latif admits the following:
There are uncertainties regarding CO2 climate sensitivity. This is stated in the upcoming IPCC report, which summarizes the latest of science and looks at a very broad range. Here it is not appropriate to boil the whole problem down to a single magnitude: the global mean temperature. Rather it is necessary to understand exactly what is happening regionally, how the temperature develops at a location. But we are not yet that far, and perhaps we will never get that far because it is far too complex. This is why I’d prefer not to stay stuck on climate sensitivity.”
Moreover, Die kalte Sonne website here points us to a presentation by Latif. On page 31 he concedes the powerful role played by ocean cycles and concludes:
The most recent decades contain a strong contribution from the AMO (MOC) even on a global scale. This raises questions about the average climate sensitivity of the IPCC models.”

What we have here is a devout warmist, Mojib Latif, conceding that average climate sensitivity of the IPCC is truly under serious question and that nothing is settled after all. Therefore any claims to certainty made in the AR5 will have no credibility whatsoever.
When it comes to the impact of the sun, von Storch warns:
We should not declare this discussion over too soon. When we look at the 20th century, the climate fluctuations cannot be exclusively attributed to CO2 alone or to internal factors. Also the sun naturally played a role. The question is whether or not we correctly quantified it.”
Warming stop may continue until 2025!
Also Spektrum asks how much longer should we expect the warming stop to continue. Latif:
I wouldn’t be surprised if the temperatures remain at a high level until 2020 or 2025.”
That would mean almost 30 years without any warming. That also means the temperature will in 2025 will be 0.6°C below what the models projected. Meanwhile Hans von Storch says he is starting to get nervous:
I would get nervous if the temperature continues to pause more than 5 years more. The we would really need to question our climate models. But I also do not expect a cooling.”
My feeling is that we’ll be checking in 2018. But then again, in five years time both will probably be retired.

"Devil rays, close cousins of the enormous manta rays, are stars of nature documentaries. They tend to collect together in large numbers, and some species leap from the water. Because of this they are popular with divers and, like mantas, important for tourism. But as is so often the case with some of our favourite species, these charismatic creatures are under threat from humans, specifically, because of the gill plate trade.  Devil rays are pulled out of the sea in huge numbers, all over the world, and butchered on beaches for their gill plates, the feather-like organs that they use to filter plankton and small fish – their preferred prey – from the oceans. The gill plates are then sold in markets in parts of Asia as a purported health tonic, despite the fact that there is no scientific evidence whatsoever to support this claim.  Unfortunately, these rays are both vulnerable to targeted fishing and often victims of bycatch. To make matters worse, the nine described species of devil ray are known to be some of the slowest reproducing of any elasmobranch, the group which includes sharks and rays. Females take many years to reach maturity, and only produce a single live pup every few years. Huge declines of these rays have been documented all over the world – at a rate of to 99% in some places. So what is being done? In September and October 2016, the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) met in Johannesburg, South Africa, for its 17th conference. This is the same organisation which is responsible for regulating trade in some of the world’s most infamous wildlife products, including elephant ivory and rhino horn. The meeting happens every three years, and delegates from the 183 signatory countries discussed listing all nine devil ray species under the convention, to regulate the trade in the species and their parts.  I was lucky enough to be present at the meeting, and to see the devil ray proposal achieve the required two-thirds majority vote. These new regulations are being implemented in April 2017 – so it is becoming illegal to trade in devil rays, or any of their parts, such as gill plates, across international borders without permits approving that the trade is not detrimental to the wild population.  One of the main concerns about enforcing the devil ray regulations is identifying between species, which are visually very similar. Compound that with the fact that those monitoring the fisheries – and customs officials – are often presented with gill plates, and not the whole specimen. Despite these issues, the devil ray listing will also greatly benefit the existing protections for manta rays, as manta gill plates can no longer be hidden among devil ray gill plates. A large part of my work focuses on developing traceability tools that can identify a devil ray, or any of its parts, and which region it has come from. The intention is that this will assist with enforcement and monitoring of the new CITES regulations. I am also doing the same for the manta rays, which were listed on CITES in 2013. Essentially, we take tissue samples from individuals of known species and sequence short fragments of the DNA that they contain. This allows us to build up a picture of the genetic signatures of each species and population, to which we can compare samples from an unknown individual or part. What we are looking for is a minimum number of regions within the genome that are unique enough within species to give us confidence in assignment and this assists us in identifying which species it came from.  The project is fortunate to have had a lot of support from international researchers and organisations, and therefore has access to one of the world’s most comprehensive sets of manta and devil ray tissue samples, which will allow the final tool to be as robust as possible. The hope is, that with regulations such as CITES effectively enforced, marine life will still be as vibrant and exciting for many generations to come."
"When the dinosaurs were wiped off the face of the planet, how did they leave? Was it a slow, plodding decline or a short sharp bang? Back in the 1960s and 1970s, debate about this question was mainly taking place on the ground, at fossil sites in places like Montana. Paleontologist Robert Sloan and his colleagues documented evidence for the long-term decline of dinosaurs over a 10m to 20m-year period. Dinosaurs had been losing out, ever so slowly, to the rising mammals, mainly as a result of cooling climates. Indeed, climates at this time were cooling. And because dinosaurs relied on the external environment to maintain their body temperatures, this would have hurt them.  But two revelations dramatically switched the consensus against gradual decline. First, the geological field evidence suggested no gradual decline in dinosaur fossils in the rocks. Plus the overlap of declining dinosaurs and rising mammals noted by Sloan turned out to be based on faulty fieldwork and fossil dating. Fossils can be moved from one type of rock to another by being “reworked” or eroded, moved along and then deposited for a second time in younger rocks, providing misleading information about their true age. The other revelation was the 1980 discovery by Luis Alvarez, which showed that the Earth had been struck by a huge meteorite 66m years ago. It was a collision that threw up vast tonnages of black dust into the atmosphere, which blacked out the sun, leading to freezing and darkness for some months. This was accepted reluctantly at first by geologists, but then enthusiastically as the evidence accumulated.  Impact and sudden death of the dinosaurs made complete sense. The last dinosaurs, such as Triceratops and Tyrannosaurus rex, were imagined as dumbfounded by the asteroid streaking through the sky, and killed wholesale by a consequent fireball and then freezing darkness. But did the dinosaurs really disappear with a bang? New evidence now suggests instead a very, very, long decline, perhaps as long as 40m years. Part of this comes from our application of a modelling technique to the data. The key here is to have an evolutionary tree, what is known as a “phylogeny”, which is dated accurately against geological time. Although the fossil record of dinosaurs is incomplete and patchy, we do have high quality phylogenies, tested over 30 years of research, that provide solid information on dinosaurian relationships.  Once you have a phylogeny, and date it against a geological time scale, you can read off a great deal of new information. It helps to joins the dots, linking isolated finds, and bridging gaps. It also provides a framework from which rich data on rates of evolution can be calculated. We wanted to explore a hint of decline that had been noted in the first such comparative phylogenetic analysis.Our new work focused on exploring the diversity dynamics of dinosaurs through their entire evolution. We confirmed first that they did most of their evolving in the first half of their reign on Earth, during the late Triassic and early to middle Jurassic periods, some 230m to 150m years ago.  Most importantly, we found clear evidence for a long-term decline from 40m years before the end of the Cretaceous period. We looked at all dinosaurs, and then each of the main subgroups. The only exceptions were the duck-billed dinosaurs (hadrosaurs) and the horned ceratopsians, both of which showed renewed bursts of evolving into new distinct species later on. So after so much recent disagreement, can our new theory be believed? We believe so. It is based on the most detailed data ever assembled, a complete evolutionary tree of more than 600 species of dinosaurs, with better control on the time scale than ever before.  The result was obtained through modelling of the data using an approach which allowed us to repeat the calculations millions of time, using different assumptions about uncertainties each time, to see whether the analysis converged on a single result. In this case, we modelled uncertainties in the phylogeny, in geological dating, and in sampling, and tried every variant of the data, and the result was robust. We can now say categorically: for their final 40m years on Earth, the dinosaurs were in decline - their rate of species extinction was on average consistently higher than their rate of forming new and distinct species (speciation). But what we cannot yet explain is why this was so. We found correlation of our speciation dynamics data with sea level, but a more detailed exploration is needed of the impact of cooling climates and their interactions with other species such as mammals. Whatever the driver, dinosaurs were declining. They went out with a long, protracted whimper … followed by that almighty meteoric bang."
"A large oil find has been declared 60 miles west of Shetland, off the north coast of Scotland. It’s being described as the UK’s “largest undeveloped discovery”. Taken at face value, this is exciting news for an industry still reeling after the oil price collapse of the past few years (environmentalists though are less enthusiastic). The discovery was made by Hurricane Energy, a specialist exploration firm, which announced that its Halifax well had found large amounts of oil. It said it had also successfully undertaken a production test in which oil flowed at an impressive rate. This find may even be connected with a previous discovery nearby (the Lancaster field) and hence be part of one large accumulation of nearly a billion untapped barrels. Hurricane Energy specialises in trying to extract oil from so-called fractured “basement” reservoirs. While most oil, including most North Sea oil, is found within sedimentary rocks such as sandstone, these basements occur when oil gathers in the natural cracks (or fractures) between impermeable igneous rock. In this specific case, Hurricane was actively searching along the Rona Ridge – a prominent seabed feature which hosts several oil fields. This is undoubtedly an encouraging result for the UK oil industry as it seeks to extend the life of a mature basin characterised by ever diminishing resources. However, it is important to underline that there are major geological hurdles still to overcome and the oil can’t yet be considered potential, probable or proven reserves, all of which have strict statistical and commercial definitions. Although fractured reservoirs have been successful elsewhere in the world, most notably in Vietnam and Yemen, this would be a first in the UK. The rocks around Shetland are very dense, and it’s particularly hard to work out how much oil is found in the narrow, open fractures in between them.  Success is likely then to be dependent on the fractures, which not only need to be significant but also suitably oriented for a directional drill bit to intersect them. Fractured basements are notorious for fast depletion on production as the fractures are drained quickly, and such fields consequently commonly have a shorter shelf life. It is also worth remembering that no basement has been shown to work elsewhere in the North Sea to date. Concerns over economic viability mean the most notable discoveries at Cairngorm and at Bagpuss have yet to be developed. Hurricane will need to conduct an extended well test to demonstrate sufficient flow for the field to be feasible in the long term. Also, more drilling will probably be required to ascertain whether the Halifax oil exists in one large reservoir or in several smaller accumulations. The latter is much harder to develop. The billion barrels quoted in the media is certainly an eye-watering discovery – especially now, after oil firms have been scouring the North Sea for decades. However it is unclear whether these are actual usable resources. Given what we know about this field and the typical recovery rates of oil from fractured reservoirs, actual reserves may be around 200m barrels – reasonably large but not especially so (the largest oil fields in the Gulf have tens of billions of barrels).  We also don’t yet know what sort of oil has been found. Oil in nearby Clair Field is particularly viscous and heavy, which meant it was left in the ground for almost 20 years until better technology and higher prices made extracting it worthwhile. If the Lancaster/Halifax oil has similar characteristics the operator will face additional challenges.  Even presupposing that the geology, oil type and drilling can lead to a successful development, it seems likely that evacuation would have to take place by hooking up the discovery with existing pipeline infrastructure or a Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) facility.  However, with the infrastructure that is now in place and with the experience major operators have gained in developing their oilfields west of Shetland with few incidents, the development of another large field nearby should not prove to be a major hurdle. This discovery raises various social and political questions, of course. After Brexit, is this the UK’s oil or Scotland’s, or even Shetland’s? Do people want the jobs, income and secure energy supply that comes from a thriving offshore industry, or would they instead highlight the global carbon budget and choose to leave that oil under the sea? Who knows? What we can say, as petroleum geoscientists, is that we are excited but cautious. After all, it took more than 28 years from Clair’s initial discovery for its reserves to be confirmed."

Share this...FacebookTwitterTwitter today led me to a comical report by “climate communications expert” David Holmes titled: Four Hiroshima bombs a second: how we imagine climate change. We’ve all heard about the farmer who expected to harvest a thousand bushels, but ended up only with only a hundred. Gee, whatever happened to the other 900?

Has anyone seen 1.9 billion Hiroshima bombs of missing heat? Goofball climate professors can’t find the mega-heat. Photo source: theconversation.com/uk.
Yes, expectations are often far from reality.
In his post Holmes tells his readers that James Hansen calculated that “the planet is building up heat at the equivalent of four Hiroshima bombs worth of energy every second” and that John Cook (the guy who lost thousands of scientists in a simple survey) and oceanographer John Church say “90% of that heat is going into the oceans.” …somewhere.
Such a naïve calculation is Holmes idea of poignantly communicating the seriousness of man-made global warming to the public. With such enormous heat being added to the lower atmosphere, you’d think it would heat up very quickly. Recall that according to the models and the physics, the heat is indeed supposed to appear in the lower atmosphere, and not hidden miles deep down in the oceans.

Well it hasn’t, and it’s a real big problem for climate scientists. Expectations again far from reality. In fact the temperature of the lower atmosphere hasn’t gone up at all in 15 years, nor has the upper 700 meters of the ocean. Even the ice caps are growing once again, thus showing that heat, to the contrary, is disappearing! Holmes and climate scientists insist that the heat is there, and that 90% is hidden somewhere DEEP in the oceans in a place from which we happen to have very little measured data.
Whopping 1.9 billion Hiroshima bombs of heat – missing!
Just how much heat is lost? Using Hansen’s 4 Hiroshima bombs per second calculation over 15 years, it comes out to 1.9 billion Hiroshima bombs of heat. It’s gone – missing! Nobody is able to find it.
The truth is that most of it very likely does not even exist. This is an error magnitude of monumental proportions committed by the climate modelers. The 1.9 billion Hiroshima bombs of heat is their error, and it is glaring. This is way beyond left field. It’s not even in the ball park. Soon we are going to need an awfully big ocean to hide that kind of error. Little wonder that an exasperated Kevin Trenberth once called it a “travesty“.
Astonishingly, Holmes admits that “for the most part, climate change as change cannot be visualised. People living in cities are the last to notice changes in climate, because it is happening a long way from our direct experience in the natural world.”
Indeed. If it wasn’t for all the media hype, nobody would even notice climate change.

"When mass market 4x4s first appeared on the scene in the 1970s, I was a little boy. I was in awe of these huge, rugged things that started appearing everywhere. Toyota Landcruisers, Range Rovers, Mercedes G models, Chevy Blazers … they had an air of exoticism and adventure that I found irresistible. I could literally smell horses and hear country music every time a Blazer or a Bronco appeared on the roads of my hometown, as if they had driven straight there from the Wild West. That magic was not lost on the adults, either. All around us, friends and family began contemplating the purchase of one of these newly-domesticated adventure vehicles. Would it be a Nissan Patrol or an Isuzu Trooper? A Suzuki LJ or a Samurai? It was the fashionable thing to do to buy a vehicle you could easily take across the Sahara and back, or do the Transamericana in, from Alaska to Argentina. Many rarely left the nearby cul-de-sac, but I know some that went to the ends of the Earth. It was as if the world had suddenly become a more accessible place – and what’s more, this new breed of vehicles could even take you to Timbuktu in a measure of comfort. There were perfectly domesticated seats inside, you could get power steering, even automatic transmission, just like in a normal car. Only these things could play tricks you wouldn’t dream of performing with one of those more conventional vehicles.  My father and I spent unforgettable hours test driving late 70s and early 80s SUVs in the presence of enthusiastic salesmen who would stop at nothing to convince us that every high school teacher needed a vehicle that could climb a 45-degree incline in low gear, lock differentials, and wade through surging rivers. Some of these test drives felt positively dangerous, and yet, car and passengers always emerged unscathed back at the dealership. This was also the time of the Cold War, and we Europeans eyed the Soviet Union and the Eastern Block as a place perhaps best compared to the Land of Mordor in Lord of the Rings. It seemed a mysterious place, closed to all inquiry and even touristic interest, all the while coldly plotting to eradicate us all.  And yet, they gave us fantastic Radio Yerevan jokes – and some truly iconic cars (as well as some rather sketchy ones). In fact, my mother’s side of the family started the Czech company Tatra, known among vintage car enthusiasts as the manufacturers of wonderfully dolphin-shaped vehicles with air-cooled, rear-mounted V8 engines and central, airplane-style fins. These jokes and the family car connection enabled me at an early age to fully appreciate one contender in the 1970-80s 4x4 racket many Western Europeans eyed with contempt and suspicion: the Lada Niva. The Russian car marque Lada, produced by AvtoVAZ, was the butt of jokes in the West. What do you call a Lada with a sunroof? Yes, a skip (that’s a dumpster to north American readers). The saloon car, the Riva, was the main target of the jibes. But Lada made an off-roader too. The rugged little Niva first took to the road in 1977. And 40 years on it’s still going strong.  My first encounter with this vehicle was at a motor show in Germany, where it was trying hard to look cool next to a Toyota Landcruiser J50 … and winning hands down, in my opinion. Where the Toyota came across as brutish, tinny and truck-like, the Lada exuded an almost feminine grace and an urbane elegance that could have befitted a city in Italy. Keep in mind, this is the late 1970s – a time when people thought the Mercedes W114 looked “sleek” (these days, we would liken it more to a piece of furniture). The Lada Niva (“нива” is the Russian for “crop field”) was an immensely advanced and forward-thinking concept. And now it is apparent how influential it has actually been. Its dimensions are very reasonable, compact, garage-friendly; you can drive around a European city in one without worrying you might leave a trail of destruction. Its body has a timeless, almost Italian, Giorgetto Giugiaroesque aesthetic, which is perhaps no wonder since the Italians featured heavily in Eastern Block car design at the time, and incidentally also designed the last generation Tatra V8 in the 70s.  But it wasn’t only the way the Niva looked that made it special; it actually had a unibody, which set it apart from the ladder-frame based monsters around it, resulting in more refined handling, lower weight, and better passive safety than its rivals. Years went by until Jeep picked up on this concept with its successful Cherokee.  The chassis and drivetrain were also absolute jewels of engineering by comparison to the leaf-sprung (a basic form of suspension), rigid-axle rivals from Japan and the US. The Niva actually had three differentials, an independent suspension at the front, plus coil springs all around when nobody else did this with the exception of perhaps Range Rover. Even the Monteverdi Safari, at the time considered absolute royalty among 4x4s, had a leaf-sprung rear axle.  It could also, seemingly, go anywhere. Lightweight and tough, it could drive where other, bulkier 4x4s ground to a halt. Used by the Soviet Antarctic Expedition, it reportedly became the first car to spend more than a decade on the frozen continent. But the best thing is that the Lada Niva is still available today – outliving even Land Rover’s iconic Defender – almost unchanged, in its original, brilliant, clean package. You can buy it, you can run it, you can get it fixed. The car is a brand new vintage model that makes economic sense. If you buy one now, you can even choose a snowplough as an optional extra. You could go off-road to Siberia and back. I’ve been saving up my pocket money to buy one since I was nine, and hey, now it’s 40 I might just go for it."

"Greenhouse gas emissions from diesel cars, utes and vans have risen sharply since 2011, effectively cancelling out the cut in pollution from new renewable energy replacing some coal plants. A surge in ownership of larger diesel vehicles is a central reason emissions from transport leapt by more than 10% over the decade, according to the monthly emissions audit published by progressive thinktank the Australia Institute.  They rose as the federal government considered, promoted and ultimately shelved plans to introduce vehicle emissions standards to address the issue. Report author Hugh Saddler, an energy expert and honorary associate professor with the Australian National University’s Crawford School of Public Policy, found annual carbon dioxide emissions from burning diesel increased by 21.7m tonnes between 2011 and 2018. Diesel vehicles – mostly utes – have doubled their share of the light commercial vehicle market, and from a lower base tripled their share of household passenger car sales. Emissions from electricity fell by 22.1m tonnes a year over the same period. Saddler said the increase in diesel use was one of the reasons there had been a year-on-year rise in national emissions since 2015. He said governments and industry had improved fuel efficiency of heavy road freight vehicles but done little to lift the efficiency of light vehicles such as the work ute or family car, with the issue “placed in the purgatory of a ministerial forum for the last five years”. “Focusing purely on reducing electricity emissions while failing to recognise the importance of transport emissions is taking two steps forward, one step back,” he said. Saddler said there had been a dip in retail diesel sales over the past six months but it was too early to tell what caused it. The ministerial forum on vehicle emissions was set up by the Turnbull government in 2015. In 2017, interest groups were sent a model proposing a standard of 105g of carbon dioxide per kilometre for Australian light vehicles, phased in from 2020 to 2025. The Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development estimated the resulting fuel savings would deliver a net benefit to the economy by 2040 of $13.9bn. The owner of an average petrol car was expected to save $519 a year. Josh Frydenberg, then the environment and energy minister, now the Treasurer, said reforms to Australia’s fuel efficiency, fuel quality and noxious emissions standards had the potential to deliver real benefits, and pointed out that 80% of the global vehicle passenger fleet was subject to fuel efficiency standards. But the proposal was shelved after internal opposition and criticism from the automotive lobby. Labor adopted a similar policy before this year’s federal election, promising 50% of new car sales would be electric by 2030. Scott Morrison responded by accusing the opposition of wanting to “end the weekend” by forcing people out of four-wheel drives. A spokeswoman for the Michael McCormack, the minister for infrastructure, transport and regional development, said the government’s goal was to encourage cleaner and more efficient vehicles without burdening Australian families. She pointed to a February announcement that it would develop a national electric vehicle strategy “to plan and manage the transition to new vehicle technologies and infrastructure”. “The Liberal and Nationals government’s policy is clear: we will not introduce a mandatory fuel efficiency standard that can drive up the price of cars for Australians,” she said. Saddler said based on the evidence there was “absolutely no reason” not to introduce vehicle emissions standards. “It’s a failure of political will,” he said. Most countries in the OECD have adopted policies to reduce emissions and improve vehicle efficiency. Saddler said in the 1990s diesel vehicles were viewed as better for the environment than petrol cars but technology evolved and many markets, particularly in Europe, had moved to cleaner alternatives. “The average diesel vehicle owner travels further than a petrol vehicle owner and many diesel engines have gotten larger, easily undoing the benefit of diesel as a lower CO2 polluting fuel than petrol,” he said. The Australian government has revised down over time the emissions cuts it expects to make from cleaning up cars. In 2015, it produced a graph indicating it expected to achieve a reduction of about 100m tonnes between 2020 and 2030 through vehicle emissions standards. The climate package released earlier this year projected only 10m tonnes of abatement through a yet-to-be-released electric vehicle strategy."
"Furry, fast, occasionally chubby. Small, whiskered, bushy tailed. An expert climber. A nut eater. And grey. For those in the UK, everything was going great until that last trait. You were probably thinking “cute” and “cuddly”, and feeling positive about this mystery mammal. Until you discover it is the grey and not the red squirrel. Grey squirrels are a contradiction. They have all the characteristics of animals that people tend to love, and yet they are actively persecuted by humankind. BBC presenter Chris Packham calls them Britain’s “most unpopular non-native invader” – and one of their unflattering nicknames is the “tree rat”.  The Wildlife Trust has recently announced plans to recruit an army of 5,000 volunteers to monitor their endangered native relative, the red squirrel – and kill the greys. So why such a bad press for grey squirrels? Firstly, they ain’t from around here: greys were deliberately introduced from North America in the late 19th century as an exotic addition to country estates. They soon spread across the UK, however, and today the invaders are the dominant squirrel across almost all of England and Wales and much of Scotland and Ireland. But hostility towards invasive animals can’t explain the grey squirrel’s unpopularity – as other non-native species don’t get the same negative attention. The UK’s naturalised mammals include the brown hare, the edible dormouse, and sika deer. Even the much-loved rabbit is a Roman import. Instead, grey squirrels are disliked, by foresters due to the damage that they inflict upon trees, and more generally because of the harm they cause to their native relatives, red squirrels. Studies have shown that greys can outcompete reds – the two species do not directly fight for resources, it is just that the greys are better at gathering the nuts and berries that both live off.  Grey squirrels are also unknowingly the carrier of a disease, squirrel pox, to which they are immune, but sadly the red is not. For red squirrels, the pox means painful scabs, ulcers and almost certain death (although some are finally developing resistance). The pox itself may actually be the chief “evil immigrant” in this eco-relationship, with the grey squirrel simply moving into vacant habitat following an epidemic among local red squirrels. Whatever the true ecological relationship between red and grey squirrel, the human species has for many years been waging war on the unfortunate invader. Human nature is such that, the moment we label a species as a “pest”, the welfare of individual animals is often ignored.  The grey squirrel is not so different from the red. How would we feel if we were to trap, poison and shoot the red squirrel? Greys did not come over here of their own accord and did not ask to be introduced. Neither do they have any control over the pox that they carry. They do what they do; which is to be grey squirrels. In response, what we do, is kill them by the tens of thousands, year after year. The killing is “humane” – but how free of pain and suffering is it for the squirrels? We poison them. We trap them. We shoot them. We bludgeon them to death. How many dead greys is a live red worth? The success of this sustained massacre is debatable. Nobody seriously believes that the grey squirrel could be exterminated in the UK. A report by Stephen Harris and colleagues at the University of Bristol concluded that culling greys to save reds is neither viable nor economic. Harris has instead suggested that we should move the reds to protected islands and let nature take its course on the mainland. We could save ourselves a lot of time, money and effort by not persecuting grey squirrels. I don’t want Britain to lose its native red squirrel. But neither do I take any joy from the thought of the tens of thousands of culled grey squirrels and the infinite number that we will have to kill if current plans are to continue in perpetuity.  We need to show a bit more respect to this highly successful species and there are alternative options to culling. We could start by managing forests to favour conifers (which reds prefer) over deciduous trees (the grey’s favourite). The resurgence of the native pine marten could also swing the balance in favour of reds over greys. A conservation success story in itself, these ferret-like predators were recently spotted in England for the first time in more than a century. In areas of Ireland where pine martens are thriving, grey squirrels have almost disappeared, allowing reds to reestablish themselves. The occurrence of pox-resistance within some red squirrel populations is also a reason for hope for red over grey. Last but not least is the development of an oral contraceptive for grey squirrels together with plans to bait them using Nutella. Some would describe the grey squirrel as criminal. Others would describe the way they are treated by humans as criminal. Ultimately, we don’t necessarily need to kill to conserve."

"Edward Platt travels around Britain in search of the kind of apocalyptic deluge that increasingly swamps the country’s urban and rural landscapes. He is most interested in what people’s accounts of flooding, and his own first-hand observations of wading through sodden fields and streets, can tell him about the experience of such calamity. He writes that he’s “less preoccupied with the point the water reached or the rate at which it went down than with the emotional and psychological marks it left behind”. How we visualise climate catastrophe tends toward the epic, the exotic. We seek to dramatise it through faraway scenes of the Romantic sublime gone awry: the polar ice collapsing from a glacier, the monstrous tsunami hitting a shore on the other side of the world. Platt instead locates its effects in the everyday: the flooding experienced by England’s picture postcard towns and occasionally decrepit coastal settlements. He shows how these places are turned upside down by torrents of raging water, as rivers, streams and culverts strain and break under the pressure of extreme rainfall, or sea walls and floodgates give way, and how the flood is merely the starting point for months and often years of misery as houses are dried out, refurbished – and, frequently, soon deluged again. The Great Flood makes the global local in the same way that the climate emergency does.  Platt’s trip takes place during the extreme floods of the winter of 2013-14, the wettest on record in the south of England, and provides him with plenty of opportunities for waterlogged reportage: in one village in the Somerset Levels he accepts a lift in a canoe along the flooded main road to get to his car. His journey takes him to houses that have been modified to stand a couple of feet above ground level, and coastal shacks sitting in the shadow of sea walls. He arrives at some destinations in the midst of their inundation, finding them spookily empty except for the odd hardy, or foolhardy, soul. In Easton Bavents, a hamlet on the edge of Southwold, Suffolk, Platt meets Peter Boggis, “the King Canute of East Anglia”. His clifftop land had been so severely eroded by the sea – the 340 acres bought by his family in 1924 had been worn down to 160 acres by 2002 – that he constructed his own coastal defences from rubble, building a road to the cliff’s edge along which a convoy of lorries travelled. While some locals were irritated by the heavy traffic, others admired him as “a hero of an inimitably English kind”, Platt writes: “self-reliant, inventive, dismissive of bureaucratic procedure, and, above all, eager for his day in court”. The crossover between the geography of The Great Flood and the so-called “left behind” fringe places of Britain is striking. Although for the most part Platt visits these locations in the years before the EU referendum, Brexit seems foreshadowed in the feelings of people who have experienced the misery of flooding: of being ignored by the authorities, of having to get by on their own. Frequently, the Environmental Agency is mentioned as a focus of people’s anger – a faceless, omnipotent bureaucracy on which every failure can be pinned. To his credit, Platt is neither fully dismissive nor wholly credulous of this position, and instead considers the tenor of his interviewees’ complaints late in the book as he stands outside the agency’s office near Millbank in London. This section is an exemplary piece of Brexit-era autocritique in which the author tries to gauge how much his own London-centric privilege might have shaped his attitudes. “I had become so accustomed to the view from the centre that I had forgotten the purpose of my trips, which was to try to capture life in the marginal places that were prone to flood. (One of his chosen towns is Jaywick in Essex, one of the poorest places in England. It is surrounded by a sea wall that, when flooded, has filled up like a saucer. It lies within Brexiter Douglas Carswell’s constituency.) Like any good psychogeographer, Platt is drawn to the mythical dimensions of the places he visits. He becomes particularly interested in stories of sunken cities, especially those supposedly inundated as a result of someone maliciously or accidentally opening a floodgate. He finds that these myths persist in the explanations people provide for severe flooding: a nonexistent floodgate opened by an uncaring bureaucracy – rarely an individual – upstream, or a reservoir venting excess water. Musing on the metaphorical dimensions of “opening the floodgates”, Platt considers how the phrase resonates with people in the era of mass migration. (How many times did we hear variations of this metaphor during the Brexit campaign?) He shrewdly incorporates the crude moments of hostility and prejudice he overhears that speak of a deeper malaise. Even in the smallest, ostensibly deserted village he encounters someone who’ll insist that it’s “crowded”. An official he meets at a pumping station tells him he’s there to stop “pikies” stealing diesel. In the aftermath of a flood in Boston, Lincolnshire, a woman tells him of a joke doing the rounds: that the town “had finally drowned under its weight of immigrants”. Platt’s writing combines sharp reportage with a poet’s eye for a striking image that vividly captures the otherworldly, waterlogged landscapes he travels through. He finds houses transformed by their inundation into “mouldering palazzos beside a still canal”. What if “flooding was not an aberration, but the restoration of the natural order of things”, he wonders. “The stories we have always told ourselves” aren’t relevant any more, he concludes, bracingly. “When it comes to climate change, we are all to blame.” • The Great Flood is published by Picador (£16.99).

"Everton Football Club announced a milestone step towards moving from its historic Goodison Park home to a new stadium at Bramley Moore dock in Liverpool. When I saw this news my initial reaction was one of surprise. As a researcher in sustainable business models, surely spending £300m on a waterfront stadium is a significant risk in terms of sea level rise? On paper, this is a fantastic opportunity for both the club and the city. For Everton it’s an opportunity to move to a large modern stadium befitting of a club which, under major shareholder Farhad Moshiri, has ambitions to become a leading footballing power. For the city of Liverpool, the development is a vital part of its regeneration programme, adding to its already UNESCO World Heritage-rated waterfront. The exact implications of climate change for sea level rise are complex. There are simply too many variables. We don’t yet know whether the Paris Agreement is achievable, which means we don’t know how much the planet will warm by, let alone the precise consequences for sea level. But we have some good ideas. Recent research has shown that by the year 2100 sea levels could rise by two metres. That is only 83 years into the proposed stadium’s 200-year lease. And the Surging Seas website, which maps out scientific predictions of sea level rise, shows that 2℃ climate change would inundate the Liverpool docklands in the next 200 years or so. The worst case scenario is even more worrying. Researchers at Liverpool John Moores University looked at what would happen if the sea were to rise seven metres, the same level as it was the last time the Earth was 1.5℃ hotter, and found much of the city would disappear under water. Of course, this won’t happen any time soon and few businesses are required to think in such long terms. New buildings are generally not designed to last for centuries, partly because it’s rare for a firm to last that long. This is one of the reasons why climate change is such a complex challenge for society – it simply does not comply with the time-frames of political or corporate shareholder decision-making.  But football clubs are different. Everton was founded in 1878 and has been at its current home of Goodison Park for 125 years. It will still be around to see 2℃ warming and beyond. Although increasingly operated like businesses, football clubs remain institutions that are deeply important to many communities. For millions of people they are “the most important of the less important things”. Football clubs owe it to these people to think in the longer term.  Such thinking is starting to seep into the game. The popular book Soccernomics, for example, argues that a long-term footballing philosophy that underpins a club’s direction on the pitch, can prevent short-termism associated with changing managers every couple of years (something that politics too could benefit from). A truly responsible football club should embrace the challenge of overcoming climate change. They could start by recognising their own role, for instance the significant transport emissions of people travelling to matches. I have conducted research in the past in which I benchmarked the environmental initiatives conducted by football clubs outside of the Premier League. While I found many clubs had carbon reduction initiatives typical of those found by leading “brands” in other industries, the majority had some way to go. Considering most football clubs are effectively small and medium-sized enterprises, with few resources, this is perhaps to be expected. But it’s a missed opportunity. These clubs have the ability to engage with their communities on levels beyond that of perhaps even government or religion. They are already striving to do so on issues such as racism and homophobia. They should begin to highlight the climate change challenge too. Doing so could go a long way to justifying the increasing cost of following football, and could make a real difference in terms of our ability to mitigate the impacts of global warming. Everton hasn’t won a trophy since 1995. The club’s fans, desperate for success, could be forgiven if they don’t let the far off implications of climate change deter them from supporting a state of the art new stadium. But whether they will look on this development so favourably in the coming decades remains to be seen. One can only hope the developers of this new stadium have undertaken a full climate change risk assessment – or have stocked up on sandbags."
"Carbon dioxide concentrations are heading towards values not seen in the past 200m years. The sun has also been gradually getting stronger over time. Put together, these facts mean the climate may be heading towards warmth not seen in the past half a billion years. A lot has happened on Earth since 500,000,000BC – continents, oceans and mountain ranges have come and gone, and complex life has evolved and moved from the oceans onto the land and into the air. Most of these changes occur on very long timescales of millions of years or more. However, over the past 150 years global temperatures have increased by about 1℃, ice caps and glaciers have retreated, polar sea-ice has melted, and sea levels have risen.  Some will point out that Earth’s climate has undergone similar changes before. So what’s the big deal? Scientists can seek to understand past climates by looking at the evidence locked away in rocks, sediments and fossils. What this tells us is that yes, the climate has changed in the past, but the current speed of change is highly unusual. For instance, carbon dioxide hasn’t been added to the atmosphere as rapidly as today for at least the past 66m years.  In fact, if we continue on our current path and exploit all convention fossil fuels, then as well as the rate of CO₂ emissions, the absolute climate warming is also likely to be unprecedented in at least the past 420m years. That’s according to a new study we have published in Nature Communications. In terms of geological time, 1℃ of global warming isn’t particularly unusual. For much of its history the planet was significantly warmer than today, and in fact more often than not Earth was in what is termed a “greenhouse” climate state. During the last greenhouse state 50m years ago, global average temperatures were 10-15℃ warmer than today, the polar regions were ice-free, palm trees grew on the coast of Antarctica, and alligators and turtles wallowed in swamp-forests in what is now the frozen Canadian Arctic.  In contrast, despite our current warming, we are still technically in an “icehouse” climate state, which simply means there is ice on both poles. The Earth has naturally cycled between these two climate states every 300m years or so. Just prior to the industrial revolution, for every million molecules in the atmosphere, about 280 of them were CO₂ molecules (280 parts-per-million, or ppm). Today, due primarily to the burning of fossil fuels, concentrations are about 400 ppm. In the absence of any efforts to curtail our emissions, burning of conventional fossil fuels will cause CO₂ concentrations to be around 2,000ppm by the year 2250.   This is of course a lot of CO₂, but the geological record tells us that the Earth has experienced similar concentrations several times in the past. For instance, our new compilation of data shows that during the Triassic, around 200m years ago, when dinosaurs first evolved, Earth had a greenhouse climate state with atmospheric CO₂ around 2,000-3,000ppm.   So high concentrations of carbon dioxide don’t necessarily make the world totally uninhabitable. The dinosaurs thrived, after all.  That doesn’t mean this is no big deal, however. For a start, there is no doubt that humanity will face major socio-economic challenges dealing with the dramatic and rapid climate change that will result from the rapid rise to 2,000 or more ppm.  But our new study also shows that the same carbon concentrations will cause more warming in future than in previous periods of high carbon dioxide. This is because the Earth’s temperature does not just depend on the level of CO₂ (or other greenhouse gases) in the atmosphere. All our energy ultimately comes from the sun, and due to the way the sun generates energy through nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium, its brightness has increased over time. Four and a half billion years ago when the Earth was young the sun was around 30% less bright. So what really matters is the combined effect of the sun’s changing strength and the varying greenhouse effect. Looking through geological history we generally found that as the sun became stronger through time, atmospheric CO₂ gradually decreased, so both changes cancelled each other out on average.  But what about in the future? We found no past time period when the drivers of climate, or climate forcing, was as high as it will be in the future if we burn all the readily available fossil fuel. Nothing like it has been recorded in the rock record for at least 420m years.  A central pillar of geological science is the uniformitarian principle: that “the present is the key to the past”. If we carry on burning fossil fuels as we are at present, by 2250 this old adage is sadly no longer likely to be true. It is doubtful that this high-CO₂ future will have a counterpart, even in the vastness of the geological record."
"Most of us take it for granted that the taps in our homes will deliver safe and clean water for drinking, cooking, showering and cleaning. This means there is usually little interest from the public in how the water gets there. However, it took less than a day for a story from Onoway, a small town in Alberta, Canada, with just over 1,000 residents, to make it from social media to global newsfeeds. “Bright pink water comes out of taps in Canada!” – suddenly we are all interested in water treatment methods. To enjoy the benefits of clear and safe water, a hidden but valuable infrastructure of water treatment exists in our cities and villages. These are operated and maintained by engineers and scientists, and among them are water chemists. These chemists have been investigating the use of neat chemical reactions to remove undesired chemicals and potential pathogens from naturally sourced water and to prepare the water for its safe journey through distribution systems.   The local drinking water treatment plant of Onoway treats its water using potassium permanganate. This is an almost black looking solid which forms a bright purple solution in water and also removes dissolved iron and another metal called manganese. Iron and manganese are not harmful to human health but if these metals are present at high concentrations it can lead to deposits in the water distribution system and discolouration of the water. However, the auburn tints of iron seem boring compared to the spectacular pink that has raised global interest and lively social media discussions. Customers are very sensitive to the colour, taste and odour of drinking water – these are the human senses used to assess water quality – so this incident has understandably caused alarm. The pink colour stems from some potassium permanganate that escaped through a failed valve and into the drinking water distribution system, eventually ending up with the customers.  Potassium permanganate has been used in drinking water treatment for more than 100 years. In addition to iron and manganese removal, it is used to remove taste and odour as well as to control undesired algal or mussel growth in treatment works. It also has disinfecting properties. Permanganate forms solid, black manganese dioxide when it reacts with the water contaminants – and this can then be filtered out of the water.  Potassium permanganate has the chemical structure KMnO4 and is a compound that is electron deficient – it doesn’t have enough electrons. This lack of electrons makes it a strong oxidant that readily reacts with a wide range of unwanted compounds in water. It belongs to an established group of water treatment chemicals that can be summarised under the term “conventional chemical oxidants”, which also include oxygen, chlorine, chlorine dioxide, ozone, hydrogen peroxide and, in the wider sense, UV light.  Water is typically treated with a dose of 1-3mg of potassium permanganate per litre of water, which is quite a small amount. But only unreacted potassium permanganate has a visible pink colour in water and is visible even at very low concentrations – as low as 0.05 mg per litre of water – so it doesn’t take much to add colour.  Since only small quantities of permanganate can change the colour of water, customer complaints relating to residual permanganate are known to occur . This means treatment works usually take care to remove any unreacted, coloured permanganate before the water reaches consumers.  The pink water does not pose a threat to human health but skin irritation related to potassium permanganate is known at a certain concentration. Onoway’s mayor claimed that customers were not at risk, however these concentrations seemed to vary – some had water merely tinted pink whereas some water was bright purple. Regardless of what shade of pink they receive, customers are advised to rely on alternative drinking water sources until the permanganate is flushed out of the distribution system.       For water treatment, there is no one-size fits all approach. Drinking water treatment processes vary due to different local water resources and what the traditional and established technologies are. Iron and manganese can be removed by alternative methods, such as aeration, which uses the oxygen present in the air, or by running the water over catalytic granules consisting of manganese dioxide. But every method has its specific advantages and disadvantages.  Many parameters need to be evaluated before making an informed decision on which method to use to treat a water supply – but there’s no doubt that potassium permanganate is one of the more colourful methods."
"In Down the Mighty River with Steve Backshall, the adventurer and naturalist took a journey through New Guinea, the world’s second largest island. As he travelled along the Baliem River, through some of the densest jungle on the planet, Backshall visited the Dani people, which the BBC described as an “ancient tribe”. I spent two years living with groups not far from the Dani, and was disappointed to hear this sort of language still being used. This distorted perspective perpetuates the myth of the “living fossil” or the “backwards tribe”.  After all, what exactly is an “ancient tribe”? Surely, by definition, an ancient tribe is either really, really old, or really, really dead. The Dani are neither. Nor are they “backward”. The 25,000 or so Dani people scattered across the Baliem Valley are very much alive and well, prospering in a challenging region despite being faced with land dispossession from mining, military control from Indonesia, and the occasional film crew from “the West”.  Indeed, the Dani have featured in several TV and film documentaries over the years. The first of these, Dead Birds, made in the early 1960s by anthropologist-filmmaker Robert Gardner, followed two males as they went about their everyday business. Back then, the Dani were a model of “tribal culture” representing what was fast becoming an elusive example of “stone-age man”. They used stone tools, practised gift exchange and fought over territory.  Such practices were typical across the island of New Guinea, particularly in the vast central highlands. Over 50,000 years of habitation, this almost impenetrable rainforest proved the ideal environment for developing permanent agriculture, complete with drainage canals. The Dani themselves were only first “discovered” in 1938 when, completely by chance, a pilot flying overhead spotted their cultivated fields. But they had long been part of a complex social network of exchange and interaction that reached across the island. Even the government patrols and prospectors that once infested New Guinea were restricted to more accessible coastal regions, so the island’s rural inhabitants continued farming, trading and intermarrying across huge distances.      By the time of “discovery”, the indigenous population had, politically, already been divided in two. In 1828, European colonisers separated New Guinea in half, right down the 141st meridian. By 1963 the western half was formally annexed to Indonesia, while the east became formally detached from Australia in 1975 to form the independent state of Papua New Guinea.  The Dani people are therefore governed ultimately from the Indonesian capital Jakarta, some 3,500km away, while an international border separates them from their kin in Papua New Guinea. These culturally and historically-linked groups have been fighting ever since to release West Papua from Indonesia. The region’s cultural complexity has made it an ideal location for anthropologists, and my own work has taken me to the Kutubu and Ok Tedi regions in Papua New Guinea. In Ok Tedi, which lies just the other side of the 141st meridian, my friends and hosts were very similar to the Dani people that Backshall met. Like the Dani, they value the sal kambun (penis gourd) and bul bul (grass skirts) as symbols of identity, and they value the stone axe for its practical ability to outlive and outperform the modern alternatives sent to replace it – steel axes and knives.  The ritual amputation of digits is common across the island. As anthropologist Karl Heider recalls in his ethnographic examination of the Dani, close female relatives of males killed in warfare (not those who die from “natural” causes) “have their fingers chopped off”. This is not unique to the Dani; in fact digit/hand amputation was not unusual among men and women across the highland region before missionary intervention.   In one of his most memorable scenes, Backshall was invited to sleep alongside the smoke-dried remains of a legendary village elder. Such mummification is actually quite rare across the highlands, even among the Dani, who according to Heider cremate the dead in a detailed and lengthy series of funerary rites. The practice is typically associated with the Anga language group in Papua New Guinea and likely spread eastwards to the Dani. In recent years, the Dani have been affected by mining, tourism and ongoing attempts to “Indonesianise” their highland culture. But perhaps the biggest threat of all comes from the military presence representing Indonesian interests in a resource-rich land with what they see as a “backwards” culture. Like the colonialists who described the vast area of internal New Guinea as “uninhabited”, government bodies and multinationals still view rural landscapes as Terra nullius, “no-one’s land”. The illusion of “no-one’s land” and “the ancient tribe” is not helpful to the amazing people who live there. My friends in Ok Tedi and Kutubu are artists, school teachers, academics, gardeners, widows, businessmen and businesswomen. And yet, everything they do remains tightly entwined by a rich, resilient and dynamic culture."

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany has ambitious plans of erecting huge offshore wind parks in the North and Baltic Seas with the hope of generating lots of natural, climate-friendly energy. The Riffgat offshore wind park, comprising 30 monster turbines located some 15 kilometers from the North Sea island of Borkum, is such a wind park.

The Riffgat offshore wind park has no transmission lines to take the power onshore. More than 22,000 liters of diesel fuel are needed each month to keep the idled turbines from rusting away. Photo source:www.riffgat.de.
The dream is that Riffgat will power tens of thousands of homes and businesses with clean energy, and so become a model for the rest of the world. And now that construction of the wind park is finished, the dream also includes leading politicians inaugurating the wind park amid massive media attention, and thus looking like responsible heroes who are rescuing the planet.
That was the dream.
But now comes the reality. Number one German daily Bild here reports that the wind park is indeed complete, but it isn’t going to be supplying any green energy anytime soon. Bild writes:

The wind turbines aren’t operating, They are not allowed to run. This is because the wind park is still not hooked up to the power grid. 15 kilometers of the 50 kilometers of underwater power cable needed to connect the park to the mainland are still missing!
And because the wind park is not allowed to remain idle, diesel generators must keep the wind park in motion: The sensitive motors that are to convert the wind into energy must run continuously. Otherwise there’s a threat of corrosion from the salty air.
The consumption is enormous: According to BILD information Riffgat needs over 22,000 liters of diesel. A month!”
It isn’t possible to lay the last 15 km of sea cable because that section of the seabed is still littered with old bombs from WWII. Special ships are required to find and defuse the old munitions. Unfortunately these ships are booked out and it’s going to take months before any become available. Bild adds that the park isn’t going to get hooked up until February 2014 at the earliest.
Until then, and likely much later, 22,000 liters of diesel fuel will be burned each and every month to keep the turbines from rusting away.

Perhaps you’ll recall how about a year ago a draft version of the recently appearing IPCC AR5 found its way to the public’s attention. That draft report contained an important chart that clearly illustrated the failure of all climate prognoses over the last 15 years. The actually observed temperatures of the last years were clearly below the models’ projected range, see Figure 1:

Figure 1: Chart from the Second Order Draft of the IPCC climate report (Figure 1.4. Yellow arrows show digitization of cited Figure 10.26 of AR4). 
So it’s no wonder that this chart never saw the light of day in the final version of the IPCC final report. At his blog Climate Audit Steve McIntyre took a close look and researched why the substitute chart used in the final version (Figure 2) looks so different.

His summary conclusion: Without any plausible explanation, the colored forecast ranges were shifted and the chart was set up to be confusing. Moreover, what’s worse, the new version was never subjected to professional review or quality control, and was slipped in at the last minute as a replacement chart. This is a very dubious illusory trick for which the involved parties will have to answer to in the coming years when the historical-scientific examination of the climate-alarmism era takes place.

Figure 2: In the end, this chart was used in the final version.

"Prince Charles has called on the City of London to help protect the environment by investing trillions of pounds into green investments which help create a sustainable economy. In an interview with the Evening Standard the heir to the British throne said big businesses and City investors must drive a rapid decarbonisation of the economy before the environmental crisis becomes “a total catastrophe”.  The physicist Edward Teller tells the American Petroleum Institute (API) a 10% increase in CO2 will be sufficient to melt the icecap and submerge New York. “I think that this chemical contamination is more serious than most people tend to believe.” Lyndon Johnson’s President’s Science Advisory Committee states that “pollutants have altered on a global scale the carbon dioxide content of the air”, with effects that “could be deleterious from the point of view of human beings”. Summarising the findings, the head of the API warned the industry: “Time is running out.” Shell and BP begin funding scientific research in Britain this decade to examine climate impacts from greenhouse gases. A recently filed lawsuit claims Exxon scientists told management in 1977 there was an “overwhelming” consensus that fossil fuels were responsible for atmospheric carbon dioxide increases. An internal Exxon memo warns “it is distinctly possible” that CO2 emissions from the company’s 50-year plan “will later produce effects which will indeed be catastrophic (at least for a substantial fraction of the Earth’s population)”. The Nasa scientist James Hansen testifies to the US Senate that “the greenhouse effect has been detected, and it is changing our climate now”. In the US presidential campaign, George Bush Sr says: “Those who think we are powerless to do anything about the greenhouse effect forget about the White House effect … As president, I intend to do something about it.” A confidential report prepared for Shell’s environmental conservation committee finds CO2 could raise temperatures by 1C to 2C over the next 40 years with changes that may be “the greatest in recorded history”. It urges rapid action by the energy industry. “By the time the global warming becomes detectable it could be too late to take effective countermeasures to reduce the effects or even stabilise the situation,” it states. Exxon, Shell, BP and other fossil fuel companies establish the Global Climate Coalition (GCC), a lobbying group that challenges the science on global warming and delays action to reduce emissions. Exxon funds two researchers, Dr Fred Seitz and Dr Fred Singer, who dispute the mainstream consensus on climate science. Seitz and Singer were previously paid by the tobacco industry and questioned the hazards of smoking. Singer, who has denied being on the payroll of the tobacco or energy industry, has said his financial relationships do not influence his research. Shell’s public information film Climate of Concern acknowledges there is a “possibility of change faster than at any time since the end of the ice age, change too fast, perhaps, for life to adapt without severe dislocation”. At the Rio Earth summit, countries sign up to the world’s first international agreement to stabilise greenhouse gases and prevent dangerous manmade interference with the climate system. This establishes the UN framework convention on climate change. Bush Sr says: “The US fully intends to be the pre-eminent world leader in protecting the global environment.” Two month’s before the Kyoto climate conference, Mobil (later merged with Exxon) takes out an ad in The New York Times titled Reset the Alarm, which says: “Let’s face it: the science of climate change is too uncertain to mandate a plan of action that could plunge economies into turmoil.” The US refuses to ratify the Kyoto protocol after intense opposition from oil companies and the GCC. The US senator Jim Inhofe, whose main donors are in the oil and gas industry, leads the “Climategate” misinformation attack on scientists on the opening day of the crucial UN climate conference in Copenhagen, which ends in disarray. A study by Richard Heede, published in the journal Climatic Change, reveals 90 companies are responsible for producing two-thirds of the carbon that has entered the atmosphere since the start of the industrial age in the mid-18th century. The API removes a claim on its website that the human contribution to climate change is “uncertain”, after an outcry. Exxon, Chevron and BP each donate at least $500,000 for the inauguration of Donald Trump as president. Mohammed Barkindo, secretary general of Opec, which represents Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Algeria, Iran and several other oil states, says climate campaigners are the biggest threat to the industry and claims they are misleading the public with unscientific warnings about global warming. Jonathan Watts The prince said green investment has “suddenly taken off” because the returns on sustainable projects are now better than those for fossil fuels. “The money is now at last beginning to become available … because there are trillions of pounds out there, particularly in the private sector [which can now potentially be harnessed to drive real change]. The key is the private sector, which has to lead, then you can create a partnership with the public sector,” he said. He said: “The problem that I’ve found is that after 35 to 40 years of trying my best with corporate, social and environmental responsibility with the private sector, and countless seminars and workshops, trying to get people to recognise the huge challenges we face, we could never actually crack the real problem, which was the lack of the real understanding on the part of the financial services and capital markets sector to understand why there was such a need to invest.” He added it was now “more critical than ever” for the private sector to look for sustainable investments which direct money to the most effective sustainability projects. “Whether it is regeneration, reforestation, sorting out fisheries and ocean issues to make them more sustainable. Or agriculture and how to rebuild soil fertility – which is completely degraded around most of the world – because if you can get the soil fertility back again, you can capture carbon much more quickly,” he said. The prince spoke to the Evening Standard in Tokyo during his visit for the enthronement of Emperor Naruhito. His visit took place less than two weeks after Typhoon Hagibis hit Japan, causing at least 80 deaths and underlining the need for governments to prepare for extreme storms, now more likely because of global heating."

Share this...FacebookTwitterSometimes it takes awhile for bad science to be exposed.
Often it starts with one person finding an inconsistency, digging a little deeper, and then announcing that something is rotten. That person in turn gets attacked and smeared as an outcast. But a few other, open-minded persons take a closer look and they too realize that something is indeed wrong. Before you know it, other scientists and experts in the field are joining in and chipping away, and soon the whole thing collapses.
German meteorologist Dominik Jung (right) wonders why climate “hysteric scientists” have come out of their cave.
This is what is happening now in climate science in Germany – lots of skeptic people are now chipping away and that process has become a run-away train.
Just a few years ago, the science was as good as settled in Germany. Yet, a few skeptical, mainly retired scientists looked into the dissent coming from America and found that the AGW hypothesis was indeed full of holes. They formed into the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) and before too long more than 60 German scientists signed an open letter rejecting man-made global warming. Eventually some small-scale media outlets, journalists and blogs joined in. They in turn were followed by skeptical major articles appearing in flagship news magazines such as Spiegel and Bild, see here, here, here, and here, for example.
In 2012 one of the fathers of the modern German environmental movement, Professor Fritz Vahrenholt, teamed up with geologist Dr. Sebastian Lüning and released a best selling skeptic book Die kalte Sonne. That book shook up the German climate establishment. The alarmists scrambled and put on a full-court press, but failed to contain the book’s spread. Now that book is appearing worldwide in English next month.
Recently, Germany’s leading meteorologists have begun taking note and have used their immense skills to analyze the climate data. They too have concluded that the science is far from convincing, see here, here, here, and here. Earlier, many simply had accepted the IPCC findings as truth, but for whatever reason they began taking a closer look just to be sure. And when they did, they too quickly realized that much was rotten with AGW science. Today that fact is so obvious that German meteorologists are now openly ridiculing the once highly respected institutes as opportunist prophets of doom scamming for public funding. The German skeptic train is now running away.
The latest prominent meteorologist to express harsh criticism is Dominik Jung, who I follow at Twitter. Here he linked to a short commentary at his wetternet site where he takes a slap at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) for their recent fit of alarmism in projecting an 8-fold increase in heat waves in Germany by the year 2040 – based on failed models.
Here’s his commentary at wetternet.de:

Weather: The Climate Hysterics Are Back!
Wiesbaden (wetter.net), 16 August 2013 – Hard to believe: heat and drought in the middle of the summer – now who’d have ever expected that? Hardly a summer was dryer or nicer in the last 10 years, and already the climate experts are coming out on stage.
Drought?
After a really warm July and a very hot start in August, it had to be expected: the climate experts are again coming out of their caves and warning us of extreme heat summers that are supposedly now imminent.
At least that’s what we read last Thursday and Friday in the media. There are going to be more and more heat-waves until 2040, so claim the prognoses. Yet, we are still waiting for the German winters with no snow and ice which were prophesized in the year 2000 . Perhaps the lady and gentleman climate scientists should simply once ask the workers of the road maintenance and winter snow clearing crews?
Weird: Over the last two rather cool and unsettled summers, we heard or saw almost nothing from the climate prophets. Also during the last colder than normal winters there was silence. Perhaps it is once again time for applying for new research funding …who knows, who knows…

"Almost 8,000 new private jets are expected to be bought by multinational companies and the super-rich over the next decade, each of which will burn 40 times as much carbon per passenger as regular commercial flights, according to a report by aviation firm Honeywell Aerospace. About 690 new business jets are expected to take to the skies in 2019, a 9% increase on 2018, as businesses and the wealthy refresh their fleets with new models released by three of the world’s biggest private jet manufacturers. Despite their huge carbon footprint, demand for new private jets is expected to continue to grow next year, according to the report. Over the next decade, the number of new private jets taking to the skies is expected to total 7,600 – costing buyers a combined $248bn (£193bn). One-fifth of the new jets is expected to be ordered by “super-emitter” celebrities and other members of the richest 1% of the population, who use the planes to fly between their homes in the world’s most desirable locations. The jets are also bought by big companies to ferry executives across the world. There are currently more than 4,600 private jets operating. “It is the introduction of many new aircraft models at the same time, with new clean streamline designs, that is driving demand for new private jets,” Gaetan Handfield, senior manager of marketing analysis at Honeywell Aerospace and author of the report said. “People like to have the newest and best jets.” Handfield said a new range of jets produced by Bombardier, Gulfstream and Cessna are proving popular with buyers, as they have extended range that can allow executives to fly as far as New York to Beijing non-stop. Larger cabins also allow more luxurious conditions. “They have really big cabins, with four-to-five zones so you can have a bedroom, a place for crew to rest, a place to work, a dining area and a place for entertainment,” he said. Canada’s Bombardier recently introduced the Global 7500, the world’s largest and longest range business jet. “Within its luxurious interior are four true living spaces, a full size kitchen and a dedicated crew suite,” the company’s website says. “Elevate your flight experience and discover the uninhibited freedom and tailored luxury of the Global 7500 aircraft–a new class of business jet.” Bombardier claims the Global 7500 has the largest cabin of any private jet. “The only business jet large enough to accommodate four true living spaces with an available Master Suite and full size bed, dedicated crew suite and kitchen.” Brian Foley, an aviation analyst, concurs with Handfield, saying demand for new jets is being driven by people’s desire to “buy the latest and greatest” models. “People want to be the first to take a new product, it’s like iPhone mania but for jets,” Foley says. “We think deliveries will continue to increase in 2020/21, but then start to come down in 2022 as there is a lag time in private jet market response to the economic slowdown. Foley says the global super-rich account for between 15 and 25% of the world’s private jet market, while the majority are bought by multinational companies and about a quarter are bought by companies that organise “sort of timeshares” of planes, such as NetJets, a global firm offering customers both fractional aircraft ownership and private jet leases. Foley said demand for private jets continued to be strong across the world, but had notably cooled in Sweden due to the climate crisis awareness campaign launched by Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg. “In Sweden in particular the airline travel market has decreased by 5% or so, because of Greta,” he said. “From there it has moved to Europe, but by the time you get to North America and Asia it [the climate crisis] is on people’s radar but people are not as vocal and are not taking action.” Almost two-thirds of the jets are expected to be delivered to customers in the US and China, while Europe will account for about 20%. Other research by a Swedish university has found that celebrities who have called for the need to address the climate crisis are among a group of “super-emitters” who own private jets or regularly travel on them. Bill Gates, the Microsoft founder and world’s second-richest man, took 59 flights in 2017 travelling more than 200,000 miles, according to the study by academics at Lund University. The report estimated that Gates’ private jet travel, which he has described as his “guilty pleasure”, emitted about 1,600 tonnes of carbon dioxide. That compares to a global average of less than five tonnes per person. Like the Honeywell report, the study suggested that private jet travel emits up to 40 times as much carbon dioxide per passenger as scheduled commercial flights. However, other experts suggest this figure is nearer 10 times. Other celebrities identified as super-emitters include Paris Hilton, Jennifer Lopez and Oprah Winfrey. The researchers collated media reports and trawled Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to build up a picture of their jet travel. Stefan Gossling, author of the study, which was published in the Annals of Tourism Research, said he decided to carry it out to try and identify which individuals produced the most carbon. “We are always talking about countries trying to reduce emissions, but there are huge differences between people in countries.” Gossling said that after looking at the results of the study he realised that: “I guess most celebrities don’t care [about the climate crisis] or if they care, they don’t care enough to change it.” John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, said: “Honeywell joins oil companies in predicting a never-ending demand for business as usual. The business being 7,600 new business jet deliveries over the next decade, rapidly expanding the most carbon-intensive form of transport on Earth. As private jets boom, the planet busts. To put it bluntly, it’s us or them.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterTo illustrate the absurdity that global warming science has become, global warming is claimed to cause climate change, which in turn now causes winters to be too cold! This is what some leading German state officials would like to have people believe.

1000-year old oak tree in Germany ailing because of “climate change”. Photo released into the public domain by Thomas Berendes.
Today FOCUS here reports that Lower Saxony Forestry Minister Christian Meyer (Green Party) released the 2013 Forestry Status Report, which concludes:
Lower Saxony’s forests are suffering from too much nitrogen, sulfur dioxide, and climate change. This is the conclusion of the state Forestry Status Report introduced Friday.”
Here it turns out the three causes named above just happen to be by-products of the three things environmentalists love to hate: 1) agriculture – responsible for the nitrogen, 2) industry – responsible for the sulfur dioxide and 3) humans responsible for the climate change. In summary, when you get down to it, all three are because of man. Precisely who activists want to frame. Meyer says:
Especially old beech and oak trees are ailing”.
Imagine that, old trees aren’t healthy!

Report confirms cooling
Climate change, i.e. global warming, being cited as one of the reasons would lead a normal person to believe that German forests are likely suffering from too much warmth – due to the global warming. But the report says the climate-related ailments that forests are suffering are because of the “drier summers and more frosty winters.”
Forests are ailing because the winters have been too cold, the report claims. How is this due to global warming? This tells me global cooling is the problem, and not warming.
10 of the last 11 summers have been normal or too wet
And have summers really been drier? According meteorologist Dominik Jung, 10 of  the last 11 summers have been normal or wetter than normal in terms of precipitation. There’s only one conclusion we can reach about Meyer’s report: It is seriously flawed and more a political instrument that has little or no merit.
What’s another sign that the forest report is lots of activist hooey? The above pictured oak tree, for example, has been around 1000 years. Obviously it endured a broad range of conditions that occurred during the Medieval Warm Period, the Little Ice Age and the current Modern Optimum. It’s seen and survived it all.
And because it is 1000 years old, nobody should be surprised that the tree is sick.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman meteorologist Dominik Jung has a commentary today at his wetternet.de site where he looks at the Atlantic Gulf Stream. The commentary is titled: “Is the Gulf Stream Now Losing Its Steam?”
Over the last few days Central Europe has been enjoying almost summerlike temperatures as a weather system is drawing warm air from Mediterranean to the south. But this  of course is a temprrfary weather situation and things will soon be cooling off.
There have been a number of signs pointing to another cold winter, and meteorologist Jung today points to yet another: a disrupted Gulf Stream.
The Gulf Stream is a powerful, warm Atlantic ocean current that originates at the tip of Florida and pumps warm water along the eastern coastlines of the North America and across the Atlantic over to Europe, thus keeping the north of the old continent relatively warmer in the wintertime.
Jung shows two charts of the Gulf Stream, which I’ve placed side-by-side. The left one from 14 October 2012 and the right one a year later from 14 October 2013.

Jung describes the charts as follows:
One year ago off the coast of North America there was a strong continuous current which one could describe as quite healthy. From Florida and along the entire coast of North America the current speed was more or less uniformly high.
But compared to 2012 this year’s Gulf Stream shows a considerably disrupted flow. Already at the coast of North America the speed breaks down considerably compared to last year (see red arrow). At some places the speed is down to one half.”
So could this have an impact on Europe’s coming winter? Jung thinks this is a real possibility. He continues:
For now it is not clear what exactly the origin of the flow speed anomaly is. Of course the Gulf Stream remains intact and is not interrupted – an interruption would undoubtedly be fatal for our climate [in Europe]. In any case the flow has reduced considerably and thus the transport of heat to Europe has been considerably throttled, and that right before the coming start of winter. Never over the last 5 years has the Gulf Stream along North America been so weak as it is at this time of the year.
That could be another sign for an unusually colder than normal winter.”
It would be interesting to see what other meteorologists have to say on this.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe public by now has heard every climate scare story at least five times over the last three decades. They’ve stop listening years ago.
Yet, the last remaining, diehard alarmists are reaching ever deeper into their bag of tricks in an attempt to reawaken the good old days of climate alarmism. We certainly can tell we are now in the run up to the release of the IPCC AR5 Report.

September, 2013 front cover of National Geographic shows sea level rise of 65 meters. At current rate it’ll take 30,000 years! 
The most recent is the latest National Geographic cover everyone is now ridiculing (see above). It is turning out to be another alarmists’ own-goal, much to the delight of the skeptics.
The semi-submerged Statue of Liberty used to convey a catastrophic sea level rise is actually just an old trick used by Spiegel…27 years ago, August 11, 1986!

27 years ago, Spiegel showed a semi-submerged Cologne Cathedral. Source: www.spiegel.de/spiegel/html
If that doesn’t tell us that the warmists are intellectually bankrupt and have lost the debate. Even the annual children’s ritual of Halloween scares grown-ups more.
So what will be on National Geographic’s cover next month? Bacon sizzling in a frying pan accompanied by warning, “Be scared, be very scared!“? Now wouldn’t that be creative and original?

Both Spiegel and National Geographic depict on their covers a sea level rise on the order of 60 meters or so. Totally preposterous with regards to today’s scientific knowledge. Spiegel has long since cranked back its global warming alarmism, and even occasionally publishes articles critical of climate alarmism claiming even 1 meter of sea level rise by 2100.
Bjorn Lomborg: “exhaustion and lack of interest”
At FaceBook Björn Lomborg comments:

This is the kind of scare pictures that are unnecessary for the public conversation on global warming. The new National Geographic cover shows the Statue of Liberty covered in 65m (214ft) of water — 80 times more than even the highest expected sea level rise in the upcoming IPCC report. Yes, global warming is a problem, but screaming way over the top hasn’t helped the last 20 years. Arguably it has lead to panic, poor policies that have cost trillions of dollars with little benefit, and now almost exhaustion and lack of interest. 65m calculated here: http://bit.ly/158KG7x, National Geographic here: http://bit.ly/17sRKKQ.”

Reader comments at FB:
George Breckenridge:
National Geographic has been part of the propaganda machine for some years. Whores for hire.”
Matt Greenwade:
What’s going to happen is these predictions will turn out to be false, or at the very least inaccurate, and people won’t pay attention anymore.”
Well Matt, people stopped paying attention long ago. NatGeo is just the latest example telling us why this is so.

"Angus Taylor’s office has left major questions unanswered in its latest attempt to explain allegations it relied on a forged document and false figures for a political attack on the Sydney lord mayor, Clover Moore. Taylor has spent the week embroiled in allegations his office used a false document with grossly inflated figures about the City of Sydney’s travel expenses to attack the council for driving up emissions while claiming to take a stand on climate change.  Taylor accused the council of spending “$1.7m on international travel and $14.2m on domestic travel” for councillors. The true figures were $1,727.77 on international travel and $4,206.32 on domestic travel. The figures in question are contained in an annual report on the council’s website. That annual report is available for download in PDF and Word form online. Taylor is claiming that his office got the false figures by downloading a version of the annual report from the council’s website last month. This has been hotly disputed by the council, which says the documents have remained unchanged since they were uploaded in November last year with the accurate figures. It has provided metadata and screenshots of the system used to manage its website to corroborate this. Under significant pressure, Taylor issued a statement on Friday afternoon saying he had evidence that suggestions his office doctored the document were “outrageous” and without basis. He said he had “clear evidence” that, contrary to the council’s claims, different versions of the report have existed at various times on its website. To back this up, Taylor’s office produced comparisons between the PDF and Word versions of the annual report as they currently exist on the website. He pointed to minor formatting differences – mainly different line spacing – between the Word and PDF versions. Effectively, he is saying there must have been multiple versions of the document uploaded to the website by council because the PDF and Word versions currently online are slightly different. If multiple versions have existed on the website, it leaves open the possibility that his office downloaded some past version of the document containing the false figures. Taylor’s office has left it up to the council to explain what versions existed on its website and when. “Clearly, given the document and its various drafts and versions, are on the servers of the City of Sydney, only they can prove which documents have existed, and may still currently exist.” The council has already said the PDF and Word versions have been the same – completely unchanged – since November last year. The evidence muddies the waters but is likely to do little to resolve the matter. At its most basic, all it shows is there are minor formatting differences between the PDF version and the Word version of the annual report as they currently exist on the council’s website. This doesn’t necessarily mean the council has uploaded multiple versions of the document to its website. The formatting differences could be explained by the different versions of Word software used to access the documents. Accessing Word documents using Mac, compared to a PC, can create minor formatting differences. The City of Sydney also says this in its statement: “Difference in formatting occur as a consequence of file export and operating system used to open the documents.” The formatting differences also could have existed in November 2018, when the documents were first uploaded, which would negate the suggestion that the council has been uploading different versions of the report to its website. Taylor’s office has not produced direct evidence that he ever downloaded a document with the false figures in it from the council’s website. He has asserted that his office accessed the website on 9 September. The Daily Telegraph says Taylor’s office previously told the paper that it accessed the site on 6 September. But the office has provided neither metadata nor other records to show the document was downloaded on that date. Further, no evidence has been provided that the document ever existed on the council’s website in a form that contained the false figures. Taylor’s office has still not provided evidence to show when and how the document was accessed on the council’s website."
"The Paris Agreement commits nations to limiting global warming to less than 2˚C by the end of the century. However, it is becoming increasingly apparent that, to meet such a massive challenge, societies will need to do more than simply reduce and limit carbon emissions. It seems likely that large scale removal of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere may be called for: so-called “negative emissions”. One possibility is to use waste material from mining to trap CO₂ into new minerals, locking it out of the atmosphere. The idea is to exploit and accelerate the same geological processes that have regulated Earth’s climate and surface environment over the 4.5 billion years of its existence. Across the world, deep and open-pit mining operations have left behind huge piles of worthless rubble – the “overburden” of rock or soil that once lay above the useful coal or metal ore. Often, this rubble is stored in dumps alongside tiny fragments of mining waste – the “tailings” or “fines” left over after processing the ore. The fine-grained waste is particularly reactive, chemically, since more surface is exposed. A lot of energy is spent on extracting and crushing all this waste. However, breaking rocks into smaller pieces exposes more fresh surfaces, which can react with CO₂. In this sense, energy used in mining could itself be harvested and used to reduce atmospheric carbon.  This is one of the four themes of a new £8.6m research programme launched by the UK’s Natural Environment Research Council, which will investigate new ways to reverse emissions and remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. The process we want to speed up is the “carbonate-silicate cycle”, also known as the slow carbon cycle. Natural silicate rocks like granite and basalt, common at Earth’s surface, play a key part in regulating carbon in the atmosphere and oceans by removing CO₂ from the atmosphere and turning it into carbonate rocks like chalk and limestone. Atmospheric CO₂ and water can react with the silicate rocks to dissolve elements they contain like calcium and magnesium into the water, which also soaks up the CO₂ as bicarbonate. This weak solution is the natural river water that flows to the oceans, which hold more than 60 times more carbon than the atmosphere. It is here, in the oceans, that the calcium and bicarbonate can recombine, over millions of years, and crystallise as calcite or chalk, often instigated by marine organisms as they build their shells. Today, rivers deliver hundreds of millions of tonnes of carbon each year into the oceans, but this is still around 30 times less than the rate of carbon emission into the atmosphere due to fossil fuel burning. Given immense geological time scales, these processes would return atmospheric CO₂ to its normal steady state. But we don’t have time: the blip in CO₂ emissions from industrialisation easily unbalances nature’s best efforts. The natural process takes millions of years – but can we do it in decades? Scientists looking at accelerated mine waste dissolution will attempt to answer a number of pressing questions. The group at Cambridge which I lead will be investigating whether we can speed up the process of silicate minerals from pre-existing mine waste being dissolved into water. We may even be able to harness friendly microbes to enhance the reaction rates.  Another part of the same project, conducted by colleagues in Oxford, Southampton and Cardiff, will study how the calcium and magnesium released from the silicate mine waste can react back into minerals like calcite, to lock CO₂ back into solid minerals into the geological future.   Whether this can be done effectively without requiring further fossil fuel energy, and at a scale that is viable and effective, remains to be seen. But accelerating the reaction rates in mining wastes should help us move at least some way towards reaching our climate targets."
"Cities – we are repeatedly told – are the future. Governments and global corporations seek to increase productivity by accelerating urban growth, while more and more citizens migrate to cities, in search of a better life. Indeed, the Chinese government recently unveiled plans to construct a city three times the size of New York, calling it a “strategy crucial for a millennium to come”.  Yet as it stands, visions of our urban future are bleak.  By 2050, it is predicted that up to six billion inhabitants will live in urban areas – more than two thirds of the world’s population. There could be as many as 30 cities with populations exceeding 10m, and massive urban areas may merge to form megacities, resulting in urban populations exceeding 50m.  According to Mike Davis, author of Planet of Slums, approaching two billion of the world’s inhabitants will live in slums, scratching out an existence without access to the basic services necessary for life. Another four billion will live severely compromised lives within urban sprawl, left to fight for resources as city governments fail to cope with the rapid influx of people.  Social services and health facilities will break down. Human catastrophes such as starvation and the spread of disease will result from unsanitary conditions and high population density. The megacities of the future will have weak and unsustainable local economies, that will negatively affect citizens’ lives in myriad ways. Wealth will not provide immunity from these issues. Pollution will rise exponentially, with toxic smog regularly enveloping entire cities. This will inevitably lead to a rise in respiratory diseases, which are already emerging as one of the three major health risks to the modern population. Bad air quality will be made worse by the urban heat island effect, as parks and rural hinterlands are built over to house the influx of people.  Nature will struggle to gain a foothold in the future city, with rural land predicted to shrink by 30% to accommodate urban expansion. The lack of countryside and green space will ultimately contribute to the sixth recorded mass extinction of animal and plant species.  But there is a way to avert this apocalyptic vision. Efforts to control the rapid and chaotic expansion of cities must go hand in hand with tackling the global environmental crisis, brought about by climate change. Governments, however, have proved unwilling or unable to reconcile the interests of global corporations with those of everyday people and the environment; this can be seen through their support of projects such as mining the Alberta Sands and oil operations in the Niger Delta. As such, any alternative to this bleak urban future will require a radical shift in governance and economic philosophy. Scholars argue that society’s economic aim should be the sustainable production and fair distribution of wealth – rather than the maximisation of profit. Devolving wealth and power will help to build robust local economies and strong communities, which can mitigate the pressures of global urbanisation.  These changes should also be manifest in the physical structure and form of urban communities, with compact, densely populated, sustainable and self-governing community developments, as opposed to laissez-faire urban sprawl. In alternative future cities, urban blocks will support all the immediate needs of their inhabitants; from healthcare to housing, education, food production, clean water and sanitation.  To better understand what such a place might actually be like, David Dobereiner, Chris Brown and I created Organicity: an illustrated prototype for localised, autonomous, sustainable, urban community infrastructure. The Organicity is densely occupied, with residential, urban agriculture, retail, industry, commerce, education and health facilities stacked above each other, accommodating approximately 5,000 people per unit.  Automated industries and waste processing are located beneath the living zone, where there is no need for natural light. Each unit has a primary industry which trades with other neighbouring communities to generate income to support the infrastructure. Resources should be managed at a local level, with a higher level of responsibility than is currently shown by global corporations.  Protecting the environment and supporting a diverse range of wildlife would be a natural function of these new communities. Biodiversity could be promoted by green corridors, situated near education, health and office spaces so that children and workers can benefit from the proximity of a rich natural environment.  Investing in local people through the provision of skills and education will add to the commercial viability of the community, as well as building cohesion, purpose and mutual respect. As the sociologist Jane Jacobs argued back in the 1970s, for cities to remain viable they should become the producers of resources, rather than insatiable consumers.  In the Organicity, each development will have the necessary expertise for the community to flourish, including doctors, architects, solicitors, dentists, as well as skilled and unskilled labour. This new urban model transforms city blocks into productive environments. For example, the development of urban farming would boost food production and prevent starvation, which would be an inevitable consequence of unimpeded urban growth.  The developments will vary in scale, with the bigger ones housing hospitals and other community facilities that require specialist facilities. The prototype reinvents the concept of “terraced housing”: land is stepped backwards up a slope, forming true terraces, where rows of houses are arrayed to embrace the public plaza and allotment gardens.  Within these communities, it is essential that people work close to where they live, to reduce the impacts of transport: not only will this tackle pollution, it will also afford people more quality time with their families and local community.  Sharing communal resources – including machinery and cars – is an important principle of urban sustainability. Communal ownership of assets, including real estate and green space, is essential for this model to work. Renewable technologies could also be community-owned, which would help to break people’s dependency on fossil fuel.  By shifting from globalisation to localisation, and creating smaller, self-sufficient communities within sustainable developments, cities could regain their equilibrium. From where we stand today, the Organicity may sound like a Utopian dream. But if we’re to avoid an urban apocalypse, we’re going to need strong alternative visions, to change the way we imagine and plan for the cities of the future."

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s been so quiet in the mainstream media this year when it comes to polar sea ice. So I figure there must be something going on there that they just don’t want us to see.
The Arctic is refusing to melt like it did last year, and there’s hardly a chance it’s even going to get even close to a record low there. The other story is Antarctica, where I noticed a new record was set…quietly and already months ago.

Antarctica sea ice above normal, uninterrupted almost 2 years. Source: arctic.atmos.uiuc.edu/seaice.anomaly.antarctic.png.
That record is not sea ice area, but rather the duration that sea ice at the South Pole has remained above the long-term average – now close to 2 years! Never has it even come close to being above average for that long since records have been kept.
From the above chart we observe that it’s rare for South Polar sea ice to be above normal even for just 1 year. Now we are almost at two years. This is unprecedented.
The last time sea ice around Antarctica was below normal was in late 2011.
The warmist scientists who warned us of the albedo tipping point up in the Arctic have to be really trembling about what’s happening at the South Pole – if the albedo theory is correct.
Is this vast yea ice extent a sign of global warming? I think only a real moron would answer yes. Sure there are lots of factors, but ice just doesn’t grow and grow when it gets warmer. Obviously it’s cooling down there, and we need to be very concerned about it.

"A zoo in northern England has had its license suspended after reports that 486 animals had died there in just four years. Casualties at South Lakes Safari Zoo included snow leopards, two monkeys with septicaemia and an overweight giraffe. The zoo’s owner has been given 28 days to appeal. People who have spoken to me about this automatically assume that nearly 500 animal deaths in four years is an unacceptably high number. But as a biologist my first question is: what species have been dying? Unfortunately, I do not have access to this information – and that’s part of the problem. One dead animal every three days sounds like a lot, but it depends on the species. For example, if the zoo was mainly a collection of small rodents then this death rate could be acceptable as these animals rarely live for longer than a year or two. However, if most of the animals that died were large mammals or birds then I would be more concerned.  In any case, it is important to establish these facts as it would give us a benchmark to assess each zoo against. We can compare zoos to Britain’s health service, the NHS, which publishes the survival rates of patients in its different hospitals and information is available down to the level of individual surgeons. It would be unfair and nonsensical to compare the survival rates of cancer hospitals with those dealing with orthopaedics, just as it would be to compare a specialist rodent zoo to one filled entirely with primates. As a zoo biologist, I do not have access to performance league tables for animal collections and so I can’t say if the death rates at South Lakes are exceptional or not. There are databases on animal longevity but these tend to emphasise the extremes rather than the median lifespan. And then there is the question of zoo animals versus their wild counterparts. We know that elephants have shorter lifespans in captivity than their wild counterparts, whereas species such as chimpanzees regularly live 10 or 15 years longer in captivity. Again, this situation is paralleled by human health studies where people in developed countries have longer lifespans than those in less developed countries. For example, life expectancy in Japan is 84 years, whereas in Swaziland it is only 49 years. In Japan, where infant mortality is rare and most deaths are associated with old age, even the worst hospital would have an impressive mortality rate by Swaziland standards. Death rates in humans and animals can be investigated by constructing life tables, which basically calculate the probability of an individual making it to their next birthday. This is the type of data I would need on species held in UK zoos to be able to make an informed statement about the death rates at South Lakes.  All zoos do collect such data and the good ones will use it to review their work in much the same way as a hospital would. The info will often be entered into an online database system called ZIMS, which has the records of millions of animals both living and dead. However, unlike hospital records of human health, zoo data is not readily available to scientists.  As science moves towards greater transparency and open access data repositories become more common, it is time zoos also published in this format. Independent analysis and publishing of life tables would allow for problem zoos like South Lakes to be detected much earlier. Overall this would benefit zoos as they would be able to compare their performance and investigate any anomalies.  In human medicine this type of data has not just been useful for identifying problems, but it can also identify examples of good practice. For example: which cancer hospitals have the best survival rates? What could other hospitals learn from them? The rating of zoos would allow people to make more informed decisions when choosing to visit, and it would provide zoo managers with an independent analysis of their performance. Of course I am not suggesting animal longevity is the only way to judge a particular institution. But this could be the starting point for developing an evidence-based system, and it would help identify the worst before too many animals have died."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Rise And Fall Of The Hockey Stick Charts
By Michael Krüger, Science Skeptical Blog
(Translated, condensed, edited by P Gosselin)
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was created in November 1988 by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) and the World Organization for Meteorology (WMO). The main task of the UN Climate Framework  Convention (UNFCCC) was to assess the risks of global warming and to draw up mitigation strategies. One important role was to determine the global climate development over the last 1000 years in order to see if the warming of the last century was “unique” and to see if today’s supposed manmade warming was a threat.
An examination of the five IPCC reports published thus far reveals a remarkable scientific reversal. What follows is the evolution of the 1000-year temperature curve: from double hump (1990) – to hockey stick 2001) – and back again to double hump (2013).
1st Assessment Report, 1990
In the First Assessment Report of 1990, page 202 depicts the following chart:

Figure 1: Page 202 of the IPCC FAR.
In Figure 1 we see that the period of the 11th to 13th century, the Medieval Warm Period, was considerably warmer than today. The above graphic appears to be based on the publication from LAMB from 1965, H. H. LAMB, 1965, THE EARLY MEDIEVAL WARM EPOCH AND ITS SEQUEL Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology. The climate data were taken from Central England and extend up to 1970.
2nd Assessment Report, 1995
But already in the Second Assessment Report of 1995 the curve looks much different. On page 174:


Figure 2: Page 174 of the Second Assessment Report
And instead of showing the last 1000 years, as the section title states, the chart starts only in the 15th century, i.e. exactly at the end of the Medieval Warm Period. And there’s another oddity that stands out: The drawn mean curve does not match the depicted temperature curve.
3rd Assessment Report, 2001
In the Third Assessment Report of 2001 the following curve was presented by the IPCC (as to Mann, M.E, R.S. Bradley and M.K. Hughes (1998) Global-scale temperature patterns and climate forcing over the past six centuries.- NATURE, VOL 392, 23 April). In the literature often cited under (Michael E. Mann and Raymond S. Bradley (1999). Northern Hemisphere Temperatures During the Past Millennium: Inferences, Uncertainties, and Limitations) (original chart in Figure 3).

Figure 3: Hockey Stick chart from the IPCC Third Assessment Report
In a single stroke the Medieval Warm Period gets deleted altogether. The chart shows a relatively stable climate all the way up to 1900 with an overall slight cooling tendency. This then gets followed by a dramatic temperature increase. It became known worldwide as the “Hockey Stick chart”. It was cited endlessly, often times without the gray zone of uncertainty – for example in Al Gore’s An Inconvenient Truth movie.
However, the chart became highly criticized because of the methodology employed by lead author Michael Mann. The methodology produced a hockey stick no matter what data were input. Even today Mann refuses to fully disclose the method he employed. Moreover, it was determined that the tree-ring data methodology suppressed the climate jumps of the past. Furthermore the reconstructed data was simply truncated at 1980 and replaced by the instrumental data. This was done because the data derived from the tree-rings did not deliver the desired temperature rise at the end of the data series.
4th Assessment Report, 2007
In the Fourth Assessment Report of 2007 on page 467, the IPCC presented a new climate spaghetti curve.

Figure 4: 2007 IPCC Fourth Assessment report, page 467.
It contained the hockey stick curve of Michael Mann (MBH1999), which however was only one of many. New temperature reconstructions depict once again more or less a pronounced Medieval Warm Period.
5th Assessment Report, 2013
The Fifth Assessment Report has been just released. In it the IPCC now shows the following Figure 5.7 climate curve, a new spaghetti chart:

Figure 5: IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, Figure 5.7.
Here we now clearly see that Michael Mann’s hockey stick curve of 1999 has disappeared altogether. The new temperature reconstructions once again show a very pronounced Medieval Warm Period, thus rehabilitating the MWP of the First Assessment Report from 23 years ago. Today’s warming, it turns out, is nowhere near as dramatic as it was claimed for a long time.
The IPCC has gone from a double hump curve – to hockey stick – and again back to double hump curve. This is a remarkable scientific reversal over the course of 23 years.
Hide the decline
Michael Mann’s hockey stick curve of 1999 is not the only climate curve that has disappeared from the 5th Assessment Report. Also Keith Briffa’s curve from 2000 and 2001 have disappeared. The following may be the reason they have disappeared.
Most reconstructions do not extend all the way to the present even though they provide enough data to do so in most cases. The reason for this is because the curve designers do not want to deal with the gaping differences between the values derived from the proxy reconstructions and the values recorded by modern instruments. So they simply truncate the proxy reconstructed values where a divergence between the two datasets begins. The discarded proxy reconstruction data are then simply replaced by the instrumental data obtained from the weather stations.
Example
Michael Mann’s hockey stick chart from 1998 uses reconstructed proxy data only until 1980. Mann writes in his 1998 publication: “the training interval is terminated at 1980 because many of the proxy series terminate at or shortly after 1980)”. This truncate-and-substitute trick is even mentioned in one of the Climategate e-mails from Phil Jones (Director of the Climate Research Unit): “I’ve just completed Mike’s Nature trick of adding in the real temps to each series for the last 20 years (ie from 1981 onwards) amd from 1961 for Keith’s to hide the decline.”
Keith Briffa (CRU) also used the truncate-and-substitute trick. The Briffa reconstructions from 1998 (as well as 2000, 2001) extended only up to 1960 even though the reconstructed data ranged from 1402 – 1995. This is explained as follows in an internal e-mail: “The data are attached to this e-mail. They go from 1402 to 1995, although we usually stop the series in 1960 because of the recent non-temperature signal that is superimposed on the tree-ring data that we use.”
Here’s how it’s done

Figure 6: How “Mike’s Nature Trick” works.
Figure 6 shows Keith Briffa’s reconstruction. The data from the reconstruction extends all the way to 1995 (red curve included). But the red part of the curve (1961-1994) gets deleted because it does not show any real warming and gets replaced by instrumental data from weather stations (green, 1871-1997) . This trick was used to conceal the drop in temperature at the end of the reconstruction and to cover up the considerable discrepancy with the instrumental data of the weather stations, i.e. “to hide the decline”.
The same was done with Michael Mann’s reconstruction, which got chopped off at 1980.
Without the work of the “climate skeptics”, one of the greatest scientific reversals of the last century very likely would have never taken place.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German government recently attempted to permanently stomp out open debate on the issue of climate science by issuing a 120-page publication declaring the science settled and climate science skeptics as bums not worth listening to. This kind of ugly attitude has been seen before – and with tragic results:

May, 1970, Kent State University: Ohio National Guard opened fire on a crowd of unarmed protesters (100 meters away) in an attempt to squash open debate about the Vietnam War. These protesters too were marginalized as undesirable “bums” and “radicals” and as a “mob”. Pulitzer Prize-winning photo by John Filo. U.S. Fair Use law.
German government opens fire on climate skeptics
In the publication, Germany’s Federal Environment Agency (UBA) singled out, named and pilloried three skeptic journalists, along with American and German climate scientists. A one-sided, witch-hunting publication designed to destroy the reputation of prominent dissenters is not the same as the cold-blooded murder of college students of course, but serves as an illustration of a similar attitude of intolerance and frustration with respect to an unwanted debate. It should warn us of where this is headed.
One of the attacked German journalists, Günter Ederer, has responded at the Achse des Guten. What follows is his commentary in English, translated with permission from Ederer.

How I got on the “black list” of the German Federal Environment Agency
By Günter Ederer
Either I am stupid, or I am corrupt. In the least, however, I am naïve and unteachable and for that reason I am dangerous. No matter what, the German Environment Agency does not allow any room for doubt in its publication “Und sie erwärmt sich doch” (And indeed it continues to warm) when it comes to the unstoppable increase in global temperature. Here, along with my highly esteemed colleagues Dirk Maxeiner and Michael Miersch, we are the journalists who have been specifically named in the publication as those who deny climate change and spread nonsensical things. Since then, I’ve been torn between a sense of pride for having been taken so seriously, and complete amazement by how recklessly a state authority is prepared to go in defaming freedom of expression.
I have been pilloried because bureaucrats of the “Bundesklimakammer” have identified me as a “climate denier“, that is a partial nut job – a relative of the “Holocaust denier“, i.e. criminal and dangerous. That justifies the “official destruction of reputation by the state“, as written by the Weltwoche of Zurich to describe the behavior of the German Federal Environment Agency. Yet, there is only one thing: I do not deny climate change.

Icy periods and warm periods have been occurring for hundreds of thousands of years, dramatic climate changes that have shaped our Earth. For the last 30 years we have been told of “manmade climate change” and the ongoing dispute of whether and to what extent this is responsible for our current weather. Nigel Calder, former publisher of the New Scientist and science editor of the BBC, wrote in 1997 in the book The Manic Sun that scientists reached the conclusion that our climate was dominated by the sun. During my two-day visit he summarized his findings in one sentence: All parties in Europe, whether left or right, will go along the warming theory because the permission to tax the air we breath will be granted for the first time, and would even be praised because they it will be for rescuing the planet.
Since then I’ve been forced to acknowledge that Calder was right. The rise in CO2, and the danger of the global collapse associated with it, is the brilliant excuse for higher taxes and the expansion of state power. One product of this fear-mongering is the EEG energy feed-in act. Here the state guarantees that an unlimited amount of power is bought from producers at an exorbitant price. This is a pure centrally planned economy – one that would be unimaginable without the threat of a world collapse. How else can one explain the German SPD socialist party allowing its clientele, the “little folks”, to pay billions to the wealthy and owners of vast areas of roofs through their electric bills? How  else do we explain that the other parties like the FDP liberal democrats and the conservative CDU, who even today continue to extol the virtues of Ludwig Erhard’s market economy, are calling on consumers to pay for an offshore liability fee – in addition to the feed-in act costs? This fee is nothing less than forcing consumers to pay for the investment risks of large corporations. Should a federal government agency be allowed to warn the public of a journalist because that journalist supports a market economy? Yes, I do become skeptical when I read the comments of Klimaretter claiming democracy must be “developed further” because it is not capable of protecting our planet. The director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, Hans Joachim Schellnhuber wants to scale back voting rights and award a greater say to scientists who know what is right for the people. Ottmar Edenhofer, chief economist at the IPCC, argues in a similar manner. The suspicion that this is no longer about the climate, but more about the de-democratizing of states is surely justified. Most likely I find myself on the “bad-guys-list” because I have written about these tendencies – so far I have written nothing about the physics of our atmosphere.
In its publication the German Environment Agency insists that the science of global warming by CO2 is conclusively settled. Here the officials rely on the results of the IPCC. My Canadian colleague Donna Laframboise, together with 80 volunteers, made the effort to check all 18,531 scientific papers cited by the IPCC. That effort found that 5587 of these works originated from environmental activists who neither studied climate science nor were experts. She was able to show that the “leading” scientists were often not even students and that the results of studies had been falsified or rewritten. But the climate fear-mongers do not read any of this, neither in the government offices or in editorial rooms.
Even the Deutsche Journalisten Verband (German Association of Journalists) and the Wissenschafts Pressekonferenz e.V (Science Press Conference) and organized journalists requested Federal Minister of Environment Peter Altmaier to stop the UBA publication and to apologize to the pilloried journalists. However, Altmaier sees no reason to act. To me this is the most troubling aspect of the entire affair. Not because a Minister refuses to apologize to us, but because we have a Minister who is so thick-skinned that he believes that it is normal for a government agency to have sole claim to the representation of science and to strip the freedom of expression from journalists who in his eyes are inappropriate. For our country this is more dangerous than a global warming that is currently not even taking place.

"The first female boss of a major British bank has pledged to make the climate crisis a priority as she took over the top job at Royal Bank of Scotland. Alison Rose said she would build a more “open and, accessible and inclusive” bank following years of scandal at the state-owned lender. Rose said she would reveal her new strategy for the bank in the new year, but sought to draw a line under the past following the departure of Ross McEwan, who led the bank since 2013. “At the heart of how I will run the bank is my conviction that if our customers do well, if our economy does well and if our communities do well, then we all succeed together,” Rose wrote. “Shared success also means playing our part to help tackle the problems that can hold the country back, like the threat from climate change, a lack of financial confidence and barriers to enterprise and growth. These pillars will form part of our strategy.” Addressing staff later on Friday morning, she said that under her leadership RBS would be taking “bold actions to play a driving role in helping the UK transition to a low-carbon economy”. But Rose is not expected to overhaul RBS’ fossil fuel financing policy which was unveiled last year. It states that RBS will not fund Arctic oil or oil sands projects and will cut lending to firms profiting largely from coal.  Rose is the first female chief executive to lead one of the UK’s big four lenders, after climbing the corporate ladder during a 27-year career at RBS. Her predeccessor, Ross McEwan, had led the bank since 2013. She takes over at a turning point for the lender, which is still working to gain back trust following a string of scandals and its £45bn state bailout following the lender’s near collapse in 2008. It is 62%-owned by the taxpayer. Over the past 10 years, the lender has been hit with claims that it mis-sold toxic mortgage-backed securities in the lead-up to the global credit crunch, and that it pushed small businesses towards failure in order to sell their assets for profit. Rose takes over an institution with fewer legal problems, after the bank reached a $4.9bn (£3.8bn) settlement with US authorities and the City watchdog confirmed it would not punish the bank for mistreating business customers following the financial crash. Rose did not say whether her new strategy would involve job cuts, but Unite – the trade union that represents RBS workers – said staff needed to be reassured after years of upheaval under its former boss. Unite’s national officer, Rob MacGregor, said: “Everybody feels a mixture of nerves and excitement when they start a new job, but for Alison Rose there is an incredible opportunity to turn things around at RBS. “Unite members are concerned about the security of their jobs, pay and reward, flexible working practices, increased stress and pressure upon their mental health, unreasonable targets and the gender pay gap. Now is the time for urgent change within the bank.” MacGregor said employees were understandably nervous, having watched thousands of colleagues lose their jobs since the financial crisis. “They have seen the name of their employer, often appearing daily in the media, linked to numerous scandals or regulatory fines for poor practices. The workforce of RBS has had to pay for the mistakes made by the bank’s management.” RBS employs around 67,000 people. Rose said in her letter that she wanted RBS to be “more open, more accessible and more inclusive,” and wanted to develop better communication with staff. She added that there would be more opportunities to provide feedback to the bank’s leadership. She wrote: “With a defining period for the banking sector ahead of us, we will deliver a dynamic, confident response to the challenges we face and build a purposeful bank that is trusted by its customers, plays its part in society and delivers for its investors.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterDieter Dürand and Sven Titz write at Germany’s flagship business weekly Wirtschaftswoche (English: Business Week) that it’s high time for a new climate policy in the wake of the massive IPCC failures.

Germany’s “Wirtschaftswoche” publishes unusually harsh article on IPCC science.
Fear-driven science is a failure
The authors write of scientists using “horror scenarios” to scare leaders into rash policymaking. Wirtschaftswoche cites three examples: hunger, war, and species extinction. They add:
The facts refute many end-of-world prophesies or at least greatly diminish them. …the time is ripe for a new climate policy.”
Wirtschaftswoche describes a science that has been dominated by doomsday-sayers and shoddy computer simulations and gives a list of examples of totally botched predictions.
The German business weekly is the latest in a string of German flagship media outlets to openly express skepticism and dissastisfaction with IPCC science and to harshly criticize IPCC results. Wirtschaftswoche writes:
Humbly and quietly the IPCC is forced to admit that the central mechanism for global warming is not functioning like the scientists said it would, at least for the time being. […] Even though CO2 concentrations are increasing like the scientists have said it would, global warming has paused for 15 years. No IPCC climate model had predicted that.”
Moreover, Wirtschaftswoche adds that “scientists are urgently scrambling for an explanation“:
One thing is clear, something cannot be right with the previous simulations. The climate is obviously reacting far less sensitively to the rise in greenhouse gases than feared.
Mann’s hockey stick among top 5 climate bloopers

Wirtschaftswoche also highlights the top 5 grossly blundered claims made by IPCC scientists: 1) increasing cyclone frequency, 2) the hockey stick chart, 3) rapidly melting sea ice, 4) melting Himalayan glaciers, 5) Africa threatened by starvation. All of these have turned out to be false, writes Wirtschftswoche.
On Michael Mann’s hockey stick chart: The magazine writes:
There’s a suspicion that scientists led by US climatologist Michael Mann ‘smoothed’ the climate curve in order to underscore drama.”
Wirtschaftswoche also expresses surprise that Antarctic sea ice is near record highs and that cyclones are not growing in frequency, and that the IPCC only mentions extreme weather frequency on the very fringes of its report. In summary the business weekly concludes that much is rotten with the current state of IPCC science, and thus it is indeed “time for a new climate policy“.
Richard Tol: all cost, no benefit
To be fair, Wirtschaftswoche insists that the risks of manmade climate change cannot be underestimated and that steps should be taken to curb emissions. But the authors also caution against throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Climate policy has to make sense, and this has not been the case, Wirtschaftswoche writes. The magazine cites economist Richard Tol:
Dutch environmental economist Richard Tol has compared the costs and benefits. By the year 2100 the EU will have pumped nearly 15 trillion euros into climate protection. That amount of money however brakes the temperature rise only 0.05°C.”
Moreover, Wirtschaftswoche writes stricter CO2 emission standards for automobiles would add 3600 euros to the price tag of each automobile, making mobility for the poor a daunting task.
Wirtschaftswoche has nothing against those who wish to protect the climate, but argues that “the means must be effective. In the end if both climate and the economy are driven into the ground, no one will be helped.”
Wirtschaftswoche’s top 6 doomsday sayers
Wirtschaftswoche also lists its top 6 doomsday-sayers of climate change: 6) Michael Mann: past climate like a hockey stick, 5) Angela Merkel: 4°C rise likely, 4) Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber: Sahara may extend to Berlin, 3) Nicholas Stern: worst climate in 30 million years, 2) Rajendra Pachauri: heatwave warnings, and no. 1 (no surprise here) Al Gore for his catastrophic sea level rise warnings.
It’s beginning to dawn on Germans that climate science has been much less about science, and much more about hoax. Expect more critical articles soon. The climate change issue is sinking faster than the Titanic.

"What did you do before you joined the Guardian? I did a PhD and post-doc research in geology at Edinburgh University, including an expedition to Antarctica, which was amazing: beautiful, pristine with bursts of life along the coast. But I think my attention span was a bit short for academic life, so I started writing science stories for newspapers. My first staff job was at BBC Tomorrow’s World magazine, then BBC News Online. I went to New Scientist next and then the Financial Times. In 2008, I was delighted to be hired by the Guardian, which was – and is! – my favourite paper.  How has awareness of the climate crisis changed in the last decade? What do you think the big milestones have been? When I joined the Guardian, concern about the climate crisis was running high, following a landmark report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and Al Gore’s film, An Inconvenient Truth – the IPCC and Gore went on to win the Nobel peace prize. But it was seen as a future problem. The transformative moment was meant to come at the 2009 UN climate change conference in Copenhagen. But it didn’t happen and after that the impacts of the global financial crisis grabbed all the attention. It wasn’t until 2015, by which time the role of human activities in driving climate change was undeniable, that a big step forward was taken with the Paris deal.  How has your role in covering the environment changed in that time?The Guardian has always taken the environment very seriously. In the decade I have been here, the team has expanded. But the basic approach has largely stayed the same – environmental issues affect everything, so should feature across all our coverage: reporting, exposing and holding to account. Today, the climate crisis is here, evident in more frequent and more severe extreme weather and climate change deniers have been relegated to the far fringes. With the global youth climate strikes inspired by Greta Thunberg and the Extinction Rebellion protests, 2019 feels like a new chapter. Those who have campaigned for decades are feeling hopeful. What would you say are the most important environmental issues? The climate emergency is the best known, and it will take systemic change to beat it. But the annihilation of wildlife and the destruction of nature is just as crucial in my view – we depend on the natural world for almost everything. The huge scale of the losses – from forests to insects to marine life – has only really become widely reported in the last few years. Pollution is the third issue, particularly the toxic air that causes millions of early deaths every year. Air is actually getting cleaner in some rich nations, but the understanding of how damaging it is – on everything from intelligence to miscarriages – is only really emerging now. Chemical pollution is also a serious global problem, from fertiliser to pesticides to PCBs What frustrates you about how these issues are sometimes be covered?One thing is the charge of hypocrisy that is often levelled at environment campaigners because they have a TV or something. Just because you have to live in the world as it is today doesn’t mean you can’t campaign to make it a better place tomorrow. But I think hypocrisy is the attack made by people who know they’ve lost the real argument. Has your work influenced/informed the way you live your life? Yes. It’s impossible to write about it every day and not act. I am vegan at home and whenever I can elsewhere. My home is fully insulated and my energy supplier is renewable. I rarely fly for holidays – one short haul flight in the last couple of years – and usually go to Ireland by ferry to surf. I’ve also cycled to work for about 13 years now – it’s cheap, fast and healthy. Being green is often worthwhile for many reasons. What would you say to readers who want to tackle the environmental crisis?The big shifts will be driven by the governments we elect (in democracies) and the companies to which we give our custom. Demanding urgent action from those leaders is vital. But personal action is also important, in itself and as an encouragement to others. The biggest action, according to scientists, is having fewer children, but that of course is a deeply personal and complex choice. Flying less and eating less meat and dairy also make big cuts in your impact, as does driving fewer petrol-powered miles and insulating your home. How can we build on the urgency we’ve seen from many campaigners in 2019 and keep the spotlight fixed firmly on the big changes we need?We are in a race against time and it’s not at all certain that we are going to win. We understand the problems and what we have to do, more or less, but the pace of action is far too slow. Putting pressure on politicians and business leaders is key – giving them a strong reason to move faster. The good news is that many solutions gain their own momentum once started. In many places, solar and wind power is now the cheapest electricity, and electric cars are the cheapest to own. But there are still big problems to solve, including agriculture and aviation. The young people involved in the climate strikes will be running the world in the not-too-distant future. But we have to make sure we are still in the race by then. What have been the highlights of your reporting at the Guardian so far? What has made you most proud? I have written nearly 2,000 stories for the Guardian, and I’d hope most of them have played a part in building awareness of environmental issues. It’s usually hard to know how much impact stories have behind the scenes, but the restoration of slashed flood defence funding in England followed a lot of reporting by me, as did the EU ban on neonicotinoid pesticides, which harm bees. The recent resignation of the executive director of the UN environment programme also followed a string of my stories, which was a good example of the Guardian holding power to account. The environment team get a lot of positive feedback from readers, scientists and policymakers, which is very heartening. One prominent scientist recently told me: “Thank God for the Guardian!” What is the area within your work and reporting expertise that you feel most passionately about?Usually the story I’m working on right now. But in recent years I’ve done a lot on pesticides, insects, the impact of livestock, microplastics and harmful subsidies. And badgers. I’ve written a lot about the cull in England. One of my editors here said I had “made the Guardian the paper of choice for small mammals”, which may or may not have been a compliment. What about the highs and lows of doing the job?Often, this is the best job in the world. I’ve been fortunate to see a lot of the Earth’s natural beauty. I’ve tracked forest elephants in Gabon, been swimming with giant mantas in the Maldives and walked through extraordinary landscapes high in the Andes. On the other hand, almost every day I have to report more destruction and degradation of the environment. The most heartbreaking story I have covered is the poisoning of children with lead in a former mining town in Zambia. But I was glad to be able to expose it at least. What’s next for you and the team?The next 12 months are going to be absolutely pivotal for the world. There’s a major UN biodiversity conference in China next year – the targets set a decade ago have been woefully missed. The UN climate summit in Glasgow, UK, in 2020 will also be vital – nations are going to have to make big increases in the carbon cuts they pledge if we are to get anywhere near the 1.5C temperature rise seen as a safety limit. And we’ll be reporting day in, day out, across the world holding nations and companies to account for the environment and for social justice. What makes the Guardian unique?John Vidal, my brilliant predecessor as environment editor, says: “Environment is the world and everything in it”, and I think the issue now permeates all the newspaper’s coverage. That is because the Guardian has always taken the issue seriously, with full support from the top and the resources to match. Our readers really care too, and they tell us. I’d guess there aren’t many places where all that is the case."
"The ability to keep things cold is a pillar of modern society – demand is booming worldwide to deliver air conditioning, data centre cooling and transport refrigeration, particularly in emerging economies. Although our cooling technologies are becoming increasingly sophisticated, they are also energy intensive.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projects that, by the end of this century, air conditioning alone will consume almost half the electricity that we generate worldwide today. Keeping things cold is highly polluting – cooling emits 7% of greenhouse gases (GHG), which is more than double aviation and shipping combined (3%) – and GHG emissions are projected to double by 2030. Large amounts of toxic nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate materials are also released, for example from the diesel engines powering transport refrigeration. And while we pollute, we are equally wasteful – the re-gasification of liquid natural gas (LNG) from its frozen state at import terminals wastes huge amounts of energy.  But what if we could recycle this wastage, simultaneously providing cold and power? Could this dramatically reduce the environmental impact and spiralling costs? The global trade in LNG has increased significantly in recent years and is vital to the energy security of a growing number of countries. LNG is natural gas that has been refrigerated to -162°C to make it compact enough to transport by tanker, but this cold energy is normally discarded during the re-gasification process. Research suggests that recycling this waste cold could generate more than US$50 a tonne (£41) in economic and social benefits. With a projected global LNG trade of 500m tonnes, this new “waste recycling” market could be worth many billions per year by 2025. Economic modelling and case studies developed in Britain, Spain, Singapore and India suggest that in “developed economies”, LNG waste cold could form the foundations of an entirely new economy – the “cold economy”. Energy would be stored and moved as cold rather than converted into electricity and then converted again to provide cooling. The cold economy is less about individual clean cold technologies – although these are vital – and more about the efficient integration of cooling with waste and renewable resources, and with the wider energy system. The cold economy approach is powerful because it recognises that there is no demand for cold in itself – but massive demand for services that depend on it. For the first time we are asking ourselves what energy services we require and how we can provide them in the least damaging ways, rather than merely how much electricity we need to generate. If the service required is cooling, current approaches such as burning diesel, which produces power and heat, or electric-powered air conditioners that expel heat into their immediate environment, are sub-optimal. Only 23 of the 111 LNG import terminals worldwide currently attempt any form of cold recovery and this is usually limited to the industrial plants close to the terminals themselves and at times when LNG is being re-gasified. The amount recycled could be raised by converting it into novel types of energy that store and transport it for use on demand, such as liquid air or liquid nitrogen. Recycling waste cold in this way would produce cheap, low-carbon, zero-emission cryogenic “fuel”. The use of LNG waste cold makes the air liquefaction process highly energy efficient and cost effective, harnessing otherwise waste packaging. The liquid nitrogen can then be stored and transported to provide cold and power on demand in buildings and vehicles or electricity to the grid. Liquid nitrogen expands 700 times when re-gasified, which can be used to drive an engine. It also exhausts loads of “cold” as it reheats from -196 to ambient which can be used to provide cooling or refrigeration.  Britain is currently developing two main energy technologies that could exploit large amounts of LNG waste cold: liquid air energy storage (LAES), which provides large-scale electricity storage for balancing the electricity grid, and cryogenic expansion engines (CEE) that are driven by liquid air or nitrogen delivering both cold and power. Due to the current grid regulations in the Britain and elsewhere – UK for example only included storage as a specific category in the capacity market for the first time in 2016 – the business case for new investment in large-scale energy storage, such as LAES, is only now starting to develop. The first application of a CEE system is a zero-emission transport refrigeration unit to displace the highly polluting secondary diesel engines used on trucks and trailers today. It is now in commercial trials with supermarket Sainsbury’s. Other applications in development with UK grant funding (APC, Innovate and Newton Fund) include a back-up electricity and cooling generator for data and food distribution centres and a “heat hybrid” engine for trucks and buses that could reduce diesel consumption by over 25%. It is estimated that projected global trade of 500m tonnes a year of LNG in 2025 could produce enough liquid air to cool almost 4m fleet-average refrigerated trucks – equal to the entire size of the global transport refrigeration fleet today. While waste cold of LNG re-gasification is a huge resource, there are also significant barriers to overcome: air liquefiers are capital intensive, plant operators are naturally risk averse – and any such project would require an entirely new business model. Barriers aside, modelling shows that recycling LNG waste cold as distributed cold and power would be profitable once demonstrated and produce significant and measurable environmental benefits. Given the urgency to meet global cooling demand growth, there is a clear need for government, industry and research institutes to convene global working groups to accelerate delivery of the cold economy with an in-depth feasibility study. This will maximise the business case through a detailed analysis of the economic, environmental, and energy resilience aspects of this approach, comparing its costs and benefits with alternative strategies for green cooling."
"The ambition in the Labour party’s new plans for achieving net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is, of course, welcome (Labour spells out 30-point plan in new green pledge, 24 October). But climate change is a global phenomenon, and the UK only emits 1% of annual world GHG emissions in contrast to China at 22%, the US 13%, the rest of the EU28 7%, and India 7%. In order to ensure that the average global atmospheric temperature is stabilised at around 1.5C-2C, thereby avoiding dramatic climate change in this century, the large emitter countries will need to significantly reduce their emissions going forward.  The work of the UK government’s independent expert group (the Committee on Climate Change) has indicated that achieving the net-zero emissions target here by 2050 will require quite dramatic interventions and changes in lifestyles. The ultimate costs of many low-carbon options – for buildings, transport, food production, consumer products and electricity generation – will disproportionately fall on the relatively poor in society. Thus climate activists or political parties that wish Britain to take a moral lead, and bring forward the date for achieving net-zero emissions from the present target of 2050, need to make clear the case and costs of doing that to ordinary citizens.Geoffrey HammondEmeritus professor, Department of mechanical engineering, University of Bath • Labour’s vision of enough new solar panels to cover 22,000 football pitches is hard to imagine. While nowhere near enough to cover Wales, these equate to an area roughly the size of Manchester or a third of the Isle of Wight, which might be the better choice as it benefits from more sunshine hours.Tim WalkerLondon • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

"Eating healthy food is almost always also best for the environment, according to the most sophisticated analysis to date. The researchers said poor diets threaten society by seriously harming people and the planet, but the latest research can inform better choices. The analysis assessed the health and environmental impacts of 15 foods common in western diets and found fruit, vegetables, beans and wholegrains were best for both avoiding disease and protecting the climate and water resources. Conversely, eating more red and processed meat causes the most ill health and pollution. There were a small number of foods that bucked the trend. Fish is generally a healthy choice but has a bigger environmental footprint on average than plant-based diets. High-sugar foods, such as biscuits and fizzy drinks, have a low impact on the planet but are bad for health. The effect of bad diets on health in rich nations is well known, as is the need to slash western meat consumption in order to tackle the climate breakdown and other environmental crises. But this is the first study to consider both together in detail. Michael Clark at the University of Oxford, who led the research, said: “Continuing to eat the way we do threatens societies, through chronic ill health and degradation of Earth’s climate, ecosystems and water resources. “Choosing better, more sustainable diets is one of the main ways people can improve their health and help protect the environment.” Some farming groups argue only intensively produced meat is seriously damaging to the environment. But Clark said replacing any meat with plant-based food makes the biggest difference. “How and where a food is produced affects its environmental impact, but to a much smaller extent than food choice,” he said. Marco Springmann, also at Oxford and part of the study team, said: “We now know pretty well that predominantly plant-based diets are much healthier and more sustainable than meat-heavy diets. But sometimes there is still confusion among people about what foods to choose.” The scientists hope more detailed information will help consumers, policymakers and food companies make better choices. The researchers are currently working on new types of food labels to see if information on health and environmental impacts changes people’s selection of food. The research, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, assessed plant-based foods including fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, potatoes, refined grains and wholegrain cereals, and sugar-sweetened beverages, and animal-based foods such as raw and processed red meat, chicken, dairy products, eggs and fish. Using data from other studies on the diets and health outcomes of tens of millions of people, mostly in developed western nations, they calculated the health impact of eating one extra portion of each food on heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and colorectal cancer. The environmental harm for each food, from greenhouse gases to water use to pollution, was calculated relative to a portion of vegetables. Producing unprocessed red meat had the highest impact for all environmental indicators and was many times worse than pulses. The researchers said foods with medium environmental impacts or not significantly associated with ill health, such as refined grain cereals, dairy, eggs and chicken, could help improve health and reduce environmental harm if they replaced foods such as red meat. Prof Tim Benton at the Chatham House thinktank, who was not part of the team, said: “The [new research] is the most sophisticated analysis to date that brings health and environment together. “If we can produce reasonable guidelines of what a healthy and sustainable diet is, and were those guidelines to be adopted, the world and its people would be in a much better place.” According to Benton, strictly controlling people’s diets over many years for scientific research is impractical and it is therefore difficult to study the direct effects on health of eating specific foods, as the continuing debate over red meat shows. But he said the weight of evidence from epidemiological studies was now significant. “The global ill-health costs from diabetes alone are the same order of magnitude as the total value of farming to the global economy,” he said. “Our existing agricultural economy is destroying our ability to deal with climate change and also destroying our public health.”"

But things seem to be swinging the other way now. This year has not been a good year for the Arctic meltdown catastrophists.
Not only has the Arctic seen one of its coldest summers since data has been kept and sea ice up there has jumped an astonishing 60%, now we are getting news about Greenland from markvoganweather.com/ who writes that a temperature of -40°C was recorded there already in mid September! He writes:
A deep area of low pressure spinning over the northeast Atlantic has brought the 2nd spell of snow to parts of Iceland and 100 mph wind gusts over the tops of the Scottish Highlands. In the wake of the deepening low, skies cleared, winds fell light and bitter cold settled over Greenland with a rapid rise in surface pressure. These conditions, all thanks to the exiting low to the south, allowed the temperature to plummet to -40C over the Greenland interior last night, the lowest value so far this autumn.

"“If you were smarter I’d be in school” – so said a recent sign by a striking child anxious about climate change. It is a potent rebuke, not least because so many of the solutions are not rocket science. The implications of worsening climate change are also clear: while the world will not end, it will as we know it and with mounting evidence not for the better. Yet this sobering, irreversible prospect continues to divide rather than unite us in response. Between landing the Paris Agreement in 2015 and it beginning to operate next year we have seen the five hottest years on record. Climate change is our defining challenge. In nearly four years as Ambassador for the Environment for Australia, there was of course political point-scoring that makes this issue seem to forever go round in circles. But there were also trends that make me optimistic we will come closer together to infuse our children’s eyes with hope, not anger. I observed care for the environment does not belong to any one political party. Conservation is conservative bedrock, protection a core progressive instinct. Successive Australian governments of either description have nurtured Australia’s world class environment, which was a privilege to represent. Consensus on the science of climate change grows ever stronger: that the world is heating and we are largely responsible, and therefore can do something about it. Reinforcing this, communities around the world are feeling the negative impacts of change such as rising seas, stronger droughts, floods and cyclones. They want solutions, which will be a political driver. There is global recognition, bar one, that no one country can solve the challenge. It must be through common cause, by nations choosing – not being forced by the UN – to come together. Each has committed to doing more under the escalating cycles of ambition of the historic Paris Agreement. We all have made a start, with much already being done – including by key developing countries like China and India – which is itself a platform for more. It is not a choice between reducing emissions and economic growth and jobs. The standout is the UK which has reduced its emissions by over 40% since 1990 while growing the economy over 70%. Many other countries are also proving this point. Corporates are increasingly factoring climate risks and opportunities into their business thinking. For some it’s pressing, like insurance companies where insured losses were US$225bn in 2017-2018. For others it is strategic given the trillions of dollars of new technologies and business associated with transition to lower emissions, more climate resilient economies. Technologies are accelerating solutions. Solar costs have fallen 80%. Wind turbines have fallen by half in recent years. Half of new cars bought in Norway are now electric. We are currently developing a national hydrogen strategy where we have the potential to build an export industry on the scale of our current LNG production, the largest in the world. Finance is shifting. From being negligible a few years ago Green Bonds have now surpassed US$750bn. Annual investments into climate friendly technologies and solutions are also now topping US$500bn. It’s not virtue signalling or even because of shareholder pressure – although this too is growing – but because the numbers stack-up. It is sound business. There is appreciation across the world that poorer countries need help to take climate action, to make sure they are developing climate-smart agriculture, health, overall economic policies, to strengthen vulnerable communities. Many developing countries are in parts of the world that will be more affected by climate change and as they do not have the resources to address the threats they are doubly vulnerable to shocks. We are leading in the Pacific, as we have for years with finance, technology and capacity building. People from all walks of life are becoming engaged, which is to be expected as climate touches everything. The current worldwide strikes and street protests are the tip of a less visible, quieter mass of concern. This year’s Lowy survey saw Australians rank climate change at the top of a list of 10 possible threats to Australia’s vital interests in the next 10 years. A sense of urgency is growing. Last year’s 1.5 degree report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change underlined the threats to us, our land and marine eco-systems and biodiversity unless we act. Internationally, focus is sharpening on action and ambition evident in the recent UN Summit on Climate Change. None of this means success is assured. That requires a step-change in action and ambition to ensure we reach net-zero carbon as soon as possible, across many sectors such as energy, transport, agriculture, and urban and industrial infrastructure. Crucially, without political leadership on all sides we will not succeed. Technologies and organic change alone will not forge this future. That is why close to 80 countries – including those of the EU, China and Japan – are currently putting in place long-term strategies for change; as we must. I am confident we will, precisely because the convergence for climate action evident in the trends outlined above is shrinking the space for political division toward more drive for accelerating progress in Australia: for all.

"A severe drought threatens millions of people in East Africa. Crop harvests are well below normal and the price of food has doubled across much of Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia and nearby countries.  The last major drought in the region, in 2011, caused hundreds of thousands of deaths. They are becoming more frequent and more intense – and each has a disastrous impact on the economies of nations and livelihoods of people.    So what is causing these droughts? And why are they becoming more common?  At least part of the explanation lies with a climate phenomenon known as the “Indian Ocean Dipole”. The dipole, often called the Indian Niño due to its similarity with El Niño, is not as well known as its Pacific equivalent. Indeed, it was only properly identified by a team of Japanese researchers in the late 1990s.  The dipole refers to the sea’s surface temperatures in the eastern Indian Ocean off Indonesia, cycling between cold and warm compared to the western part of the ocean. Some years the temperature difference is far greater than others.  We are currently coming out of a particularly strong dipole. At its peak, in summer 2016, the sea off the Indonesian coast was 1℃ or so warmer than waters a few thousand kilometres to the west. Warmer seas evaporate more water and, on this sort of vast scale, a relatively small temperature difference can have a big effect. In this case it meant there was a lot more moisture in the atmosphere above the eastern Indian Ocean. As moist air is cooler than dry air, this in turn affected the prevailing winds. Wind is simply the atmosphere trying to equalise differences in temperature, density and pressure. Therefore, to “even out” the unusually cool air, a warm, dry wind began to blow eastwards from Africa across the ocean.  This is disastrous for farmers in the Horn of Africa who rely on moisture from the Indian Ocean to generate the “short rains” that run from October to December and the “long rains” from March to June. With winds blowing out to sea, the air was even drier than usual. The 2016 short rains were a month late and in some places failed entirely. Aid agencies  warned the failure of these rains could trigger mass famine across northern Kenya, South Sudan, Somalia and eastern Ethiopia.  Things will not improve any time soon. As with El Niño, global warming means the Indian Ocean Dipole has become more extreme in recent years. In East Africa, these severe droughts will become the norm. There are no easy answers. However, while we cannot control the Indian Ocean, we can change the way humans interact with the East African environment, making communities more resilient to climate change.  Past land use offers us some important clues. For example, a number of sites across East Africa demonstrate the impact of switching to more drought-sensitive New World crops such as maize. Maize was introduced in 1608 and since then it has largely replaced more traditional and drought-resistant crops such as cassava or sorghum. Maize provides excellent calorific returns in good years, but it often fails and has challenges around infestation and storage during drought years.  Further lessons from history show us that pastoral communities have become less mobile. Livestock farmers are settling down and becoming increasingly reliant on irrigation and crop growing, which makes them more sensitive to drought. Competing demands to conserve land for wildlife add to the problems.  There are a few things East Africans can do to ease the impact of climate change, especially droughts. Livestock farmers could share large communal “grazing banks” to act as an insurance scheme and spread the risk of pasture failure. Pastoral movements could be better managed to ensure areas do not become overgrazed and conflicts with conservation areas are minimised. Mountain forests could be valued more and managed better to capture useful water without the need for costly and vulnerable irrigation systems. And finally farmers could switch to varieties of crops that are better at coping with climate variability.  The “Indian Niño” isn’t going anywhere, along with the regular and severe droughts it causes. People in East Africa must prepare."
"At the recent launch of his book on climate change, Prince Charles observed that: We might also be more inclined to think about the longer term if we were more aware of what is happening around us. Perhaps daily weather forecasts could include a few basic facts about the Earth’s vital signs, or details of where climate change is increasing the likelihood of damaging weather? Using a few “vital signs” to raise public awareness of the planet’s state of health is a good suggestion. These signs could provide people with a meaningful description of the climatic changes that are underway. They could also provide a common basis for international responses to climate change. The recent Paris Agreement, for example, commits governments to come together every five years to review their pledges to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It would be helpful if they shared common perceptions of what is happening in the climate system. At present, we have only one vital sign: global surface temperature. Its rise is driven primarily by the elevated concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide, and it is widely used as a measure of the size of the problem the world is facing. Temperature goals have been used to coordinate the preparations of scientists and diplomats for many international negotiations, and the now famous 1.5℃ and 2℃ goals framed the groundbreaking agreement reached in Paris. The world is now focused on reducing emissions and on coping with the changes that are already occurring. But global surface temperature by itself will not serve as well in this second phase as it doesn’t describe all that happens in the climate system.  Of the additional heat trapped by elevated greenhouse gas concentrations, more than 90% goes into the ocean. The total heat content of the ocean, from the surface to depth, is thus a more fundamental measure of climate change. The additional heat also causes ice to melt, meaning the states of glaciers, ice sheets and sea ice are useful measures of change, but they are not related to global surface temperature in a simple way. Meanwhile any assessment of how global warming will actually affect people’s lives requires measures of local and regional change. We therefore need a richer picture of the climate’s behaviour, conveyed by a basket of indicators. The situation is no different to medicine, central banking or any other issue where people must diagnose systems of great complexity in order to understand what is at stake and to make decisions. Some might say following more than one indicator at a time could be confusing. Yet a doctor starts every appointment by checking many different vital signs – blood pressure, weight, heart rate, cholesterol and so on. We know that body temperature alone doesn’t tell us all we need to know about our health. Today’s satellites and observational networks are ready to support the creation of vital signs. They keep track of the frequency and severity of extreme weather events around the world. Land surface temperature and rainfall have been recorded routinely since the 19th century and now satellites give us the global picture.  Satellite instruments also measure changes in the Arctic and Antarctic and monitor global sea level with exquisite precision. A worldwide network of observatories is collecting measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide and hundreds of other greenhouse gases. For vital signs to be used internationally as a common benchmark, we’ll need global agreement on who generates, certifies, and sponsors them. This may take some time given there exists a constellation of observing groups and supporting agencies for each potentially relevant dataset. For example, sea surface temperature is monitored by ships and satellites from many different countries, and an international collaboration provides a network of nearly 4,000 underwater robotic floats that measure the heat content of the upper ocean and increasingly the deeper ocean too. Several UN and other international agencies, including the WMO, IPCC and the UN’s climate secretariat, are working to define by the end of 2017 a small number of vital signs – maybe five or six – that will give a better overall description of climate change. Planetary vital signs, by conveying common perceptions of climate change, could help international leaders agree on coordinated, global actions. They could alert people to the risks of climate change and move local leaders to play their part. And they would let voters see how their leaders are protecting them from climate risks. But to make it all work, the planet’s vital signs will need to become as familiar as the weather report."
"Coalmining in Australia by the nation’s six biggest coal producers ultimately results in more greenhouse gas emissions each year than the entire domestic economy. In the latest report to estimate the role fossil fuel businesses play in driving the climate crisis, researchers from the University of New South Wales calculated the total emissions from the coal and gas produced by Australia’s top carbon companies, from extraction to the resources being burned for energy, mostly overseas. They found the top six coal producers – BHP Billiton, Glencore, Yancoal, Peabody, Anglo American and Whitehaven – were in 2018 linked to 551m tonnes of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere. Total emissions from all activity within Australia were 534m tonnes. When the list was expanded to include Australia’s 10 biggest carbon producers, adding Chevron, Woodside, ExxonMobil and Santos, the combined emissions from their products was found to be 670m tonnes a year, equivalent to that from about 75% of global air traffic. The UNSW report follows the Guardian’s global series The Polluters, which revealed 20 fossil fuel companies including BHP could be directly linked to more than one-third of all greenhouse gas emissions in the modern era. In Australia, it found a wave of planned developments by major fossil fuel companies across the north would significantly increase the amount of coal and gas the country planned to sell into Asia and could push the Paris climate agreement goals further beyond reach. The report’s lead author, Jeremy Moss from the UNSW Practical Justice Initiative and a professor of political philosophy, said there was a clear case that big emitting companies, which the report calls “carbon majors”, should be held responsible for the consequences of their products. Global greenhouse accounting emphasises national emissions, rather than those connected to companies. There are no plans for that to change. But there is an increasing focus within companies in reporting and considering how to deal with “scope 3” emissions, including those that are released by a company’s customers when using their products. BHP’s chief executive, Andrew Mackenzie, acknowledged this in July when, in a speech calling for drastic action to combat the climate crisis, he pledged US$400m to develop technologies to cut emissions from not only its own operations, but also the companies that buy its resources. BHP, Rio Tinto and South 32 are among those that report scope 3 emissions. Moss said fossil fuel companies had a moral responsibility to rapidly phase out their operations in line with the evidence of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which found global emissions need to fall 45% below 2010 levels by 2030. He said companies should retire assets, not sell them. He said their products should be seen through a similar prism to goods that had been banned or had limitations placed on their use on moral grounds, giving the example of Scott Morrison’s announcement that Australia would ban the export of plastic waste, in part because it was ending up in the ocean. Moss said other industries where there were moral constraints included the live sheep trade, asbestos and uranium. “The only reason we care about these things is the impact they have. That’s a moral argument,” he said. “There is a reason we sell uranium to France and not Pakistan. It’s because if we know something was to go wrong in Pakistan, a safety issue or a dirty bomb, we’re partly culpable. “In the same way, to say you’re selling coal to a country just to stop someone worse from doing it, that’s just not true. We use supply-side constraints all the time. We should with fossil fuels.” Coal companies were asked for their response to the emissions analysis. Peabody said the company recognised climate change was occurring and that human use of fossil fuels contributed to greenhouse gas emissions. “We also recognise coal is essential to affordable, reliable energy and will continue to play a significant role in the global energy mix for the foreseeable future,” a Peabody spokesperson said, adding that technology would be vital in advancing climate change solutions. Others, including BHP and Glencore, declined to respond. In his speech in July, Mackenzie said the company would limit its direct emissions to 2017 levels by 2022 and set a target of net zero emissions by 2050, but the company faces pressure from shareholders over its membership of lobby groups that promote coal use. Chevron, listed in the report as the oil and gas company linked to the most pollution, said managing emissions was an integral part of its planning and it had announced goals to reduce emissions intensity (the amount emitted for each dollar earned) from upstream oil and natural gas projects (by 5-10% and 2-5% between 2016 and 2023 respectively). The UNSW report cites research that global fossil fuel emissions more than doubled between 1988, when the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was established, and 2016. Emissions were greater from burning fossil fuels in those 28 years than the previous 237. Moss said big emitters should pay compensation for the harm caused by emissions released since 1990, if not earlier. He said many of the major producers listed in the report had long histories of pollution and continued to hold vast reserves to be extracted in the future. The researchers give the example of Glencore, which last year reported it had 6,765m tonnes of measured coal resources and 1,565m tonnes of proved marketable reserves. Moss said extracting it all could lead to 15.6bn tonnes of carbon dioxide, about 29 times Australia’s annual emissions."
"Jane Fonda accepted a prestigious award from Bafta Los Angeles while being led away in handcuffs after being arrested during climate emergency protests.  The actor and activist was honoured with the Stanley Kubrick award for excellence in film at the annual Bafta Britannia ceremony. However, she could not be at the Beverly Hilton in person to accept the prize and, as is customary, sent a video message instead.  Footage of Fonda being arrested in Washington DC last week was shown to the audience on big screens. The Oscar-winning actor shouted, “Bafta, thank you” as she was led away. “I’m very honoured,” she added. Folks, @Janefonda accepted the Stanley Kubrick Britannia Award WHILE BEING ARRESTED. #Britannias pic.twitter.com/LDbZKTZWrs Fonda, known as much for her activism as her film career, had earlier said she was inspired to return to civil disobedience by teenage climate emergency protester Greta Thunberg. Fonda was one of 17 climate protesters arrested at the US capital on charges of unlawful demonstration by what she called “extremely nice and professional” police. She said she had moved to Washington DC so she could be more involved in the fight against climate breakdown. She added that she hoped to inspire other older activists and revealed she planned to get herself arrested every Friday during the protests.  Previous winners of the Stanley Kubrick award for excellence in film, which is given to “legendary individuals whose work is stamped with the indelible mark of authorship and ingenuity”, include Cate Blanchett, George Clooney and Meryl Streep."
"Disaster was narrowly averted after America’s tallest dam threatened to release a deluge of water over thousands of homes on February 12. Dramatic scenes of water cascading from the Oroville dam emerged after a hole the size of a football field appeared in the spillway floor, allowing water to rip through its foundations and compromise the whole structure. Authorities ordered 180,000 people to evacuate while the water level was lowered to relieve pressure on the damaged spillway. But 48 hours later, the immediate danger had passed and residents were allowed to return home.  This near catastrophe is just the latest symptom of the chronic ill-health of America’s civil infrastructure, which has suffered from decades of under-investment and neglect. But the Oroville dam crisis could provide an unexpected opportunity for the new Trump administration to take on both problems – and win. Winning is important to the US president, Donald Trump. This is not in dispute. He has built his name, his fame and his entire presidential campaign on being seen to be a winner. In office, he has been quick to reject situations where there is no easy win in sight: from his opposition to the environmental lobby, to his dislike of multilateral trade deals and his “shut up shop” attitude on migration. But when it comes to infrastructure, the win is clear to see: stuff is broken, stuff can be fixed by good, honest blue-collar workers driving proper US-made machines. These things can be paid for using money – and money is what Trump knows about. New roads, new jobs, a New Deal even – these all look like wins for a relentlessly ambitious president. But renewing the nation’s failing infrastructure is not a simple process, as successive White House administrations have found. Up to US$1 trillion is required to repair or replace ageing dams, bridges, highways and all the other components that support modern civilisation. Where to source the money has been a subject of political wrangling for decades.  Arguments between state and federal administrations, fuelled by political in-fighting and lobbyists – including environmentalists who are opposed to big infrastructure on principle – have all contributed to the stasis. But with a new strategy, Trump might just be able to score a big win where other presidents have lost out.  For water infrastructure, such as Oroville dam, perhaps the most obvious part of the problem is the weather. After five years of extreme drought, this winter has brought record rainfalls. Just prior to the crisis, the Oroville reservoir and others like it were at more than 150% of their normal capacity. Under these conditions, every storm becomes a challenge for water resource engineers. But what has this got to do with Trump’s infrastructure promise? Year-on-year variations in seasonal weather are highly unpredictable. But in the longer term, atmospheric rivers (a key factor in Californian climate) and similar extreme weather events are robustly predicted to increase in frequency as the global climate warms. The strong balance of scientific evidence and opinion suggests that greenhouse gas emitters worldwide are at least partially responsible: particularly in the US and China, which together generate a third of world emissions This presents Trump the climate change denier with a dilemma. To get the win on infrastructure, he needs money. To get the money in a reasonable time frame, he will need corporate investors who are prepared to cut through the political deadlock. But investors require incentives to channel funds into long-term public works, for which Trump will claim the bulk of the credit. And market economics suggests that if there was any money in it for them, this would already be happening. The Oroville dam, though, demonstrates that some of the largest imminent threats to infrastructure will increase through climate change. If Trump could take an executive decision to shift his position on that – surely not hard for someone who deals so readily in “alternative facts” – then a pathway to the win could open up.  Apportioning blame for carbon emissions could bolster his case for tariffs and other sanctions on Chinese imports. A similar economic stick for domestic polluters would be less palatable, but the money raised could be used to provide corporations with financial incentives to invest in maintaining infrastructure, expanding renewables and adopting green, energy-efficient technology. All these projects promise long-term gains for US businesses and jobs, if only the initial inertia could be overcome. Carbon reduction tariffs, linked specifically to infrastructure renewal incentives, could provide that vital momentum. Such ideas have been around for decades: environmental thinkers including Paul Hawken and Amory Lovins espouse the notion of “natural capitalism” – a market-driven economics which centres on the value of natural resources. The Oroville dam provides compelling evidence of the hard economic costs of inaction on infrastructure.  Accepting man-made climate change could provide Trump with a chance to deliver on one of his major campaign promises, change the face of capitalism and perhaps even save the world along the way. Doesn’t that look like a win?"
"An eruption of Mount Etna recently caught out some BBC journalists who were filming there. The footage was extraordinary and highlighted the hazards volcanoes pose to humans and society.  Since 1600, 278,880 people have been killed by volcanic activity, with many of these deaths attributed to secondary hazards associated with the main eruption. Starvation killed 92,000 following the 1815 Tambora eruption in Indonesia, for example, and a volcanic tsunami killed 36,000 following the 1883 Krakatoa eruption.  Since the 1980s, deaths related to volcanic eruptions have been rather limited, but this is not entirely a result of increased preparedness or investment in hazard management – it is significantly a matter of chance.  Research shows that volcanic activity has shown no let up since the turn of the 21st century – it just hasn’t been around population centres. Indeed, there remain a number of volcanoes poised to blow which pose a major threat to life and livelihood. Known for its 79AD eruption, which destroyed the towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum, Vesuvius is still a significant hazard given that it overshadows the city of Naples and its surrounds, which are home to over 3m people. It is also known for a particularly intense form of eruption. Plinian (after Pliny the Younger who was the first to describe the 79AD event) eruptions are characterised by the ejection of a vast column of gas and ash which extends into the stratosphere, far higher than commercial airliners fly.  Were such an eruption to occur at Vesuvius today, it is likely that much of the population would already have been evacuated as a precursory swarm of earthquakes would likely herald its imminent approach. But those who remained would initially be showered with huge pumice rocks too large to be kept aloft by the column of gas.  Then, as the volcano began to run out of energy, the column itself would collapse, causing smaller particles of rock (from fine ash to small boulders) to fall from the sky and back to Earth at high velocity. Asphyxiating clouds of gas and pulverised rock – pyroclastic density currents – would then flood down the slopes of the volcano, annihilating anything in their path. Such gas-ash features have been known to travel tens of kilometres and at terrifying speeds, potentially turning modern Naples into a new Pompeii.  This central African volcano has erupted several times over the last few decades and while its eruptions aren’t particularly explosive, it produces a particularly runny – and dangerous – form of lava. Once effused, this lava can rapidly move down the flanks of the volcano and inundate areas with little or no warning.  In 2002, the lava lake at the volcano’s summit was breached, resulting in streams of lava hurtling towards the nearby city of Goma at 60km/h, engulfing parts of it to a depth of two metres.  Fortunately, warnings had been issued as the volcano’s unrest has made it the focus of intense research – and over 300,000 people were evacuated in time. Should such an event occur again, we have to hope that the authorities are equally prepared, but this is a politically unstable area and it remains seriously vulnerable. “Popo”, as the locals call it, is just 70km south-west of the one of the largest cities in the world: Mexico City, home to 20m people. Popo is regularly active and its most recent bout of activity in 2016 sent a plume of ash to an altitude of five kilometres.  In recent times, and indeed throughout much of its history, eruptive events at Popo have consisted of similarly isolated ash plumes. But these plumes coat the mountain in a thick blanket of ash which, when mixed with water, can form a dense muddy mixture which has the potential to flow for many kilometres and at relatively high speeds.  Such phenomena, known as “lahars”, can be extremely deadly, as exemplified by the Nevado del Ruiz disaster of 1985 when around 26,000 people were killed in the town of Armero, Colombia, by a lahar with a volcanic source that was 60km away.  The Nevado del Ruiz tragedy was the direct result of volcanic activity melting ice at the volcano’s summit, but a large volume of rainfall or snowmelt could feasibly generate a similar lahar on Popo. This could flow down-slope towards nearby settlements with little or no warning.  Otherwise named Krakatau, Krakatoa’s name is infamous; 36,000 people were killed by the tsunami triggered by its 1886 eruption, which released more energy than 13,000 Hiroshima atomic bombs. The eruption destroyed the volcanic island completely, but within 50 years, a new island had appeared in its place.  The new island is named Anak Krakatau (Child of Krakatoa) and since the 1920s, it has been growing in episodic phases, reaching about 300 metres in height today. New and significant activity commenced in 2007 and since this time, further episodes of activity were noted at the volcano, most recently in March 2017.  No one knows for sure whether or not the spectacular growth of Anak Krakatau means it may one day repeat the catastrophe its “father” unleashed, but its location between Indonesia’s two most populated islands, Java and Sumatra, means it poses a grave threat to life. Few have heard of this volcano in a remote part of Asia – and its last eruption was in 1903. However, its history tells a rather scarier story. In around 969AD, the volcano produced one of the largest eruptions of the last 10,000 years, releasing three times more material than Krakatoa did in 1886.  One of the chief hazards is posed by the massive crater lake at its peak (with a volume of about nine cubic kilometres). If breached, this lake could generate lahars that would pose a significant threat to the 100,000 people that live in the vicinity.  In the early 2000s, scientists began monitoring the hitherto under-monitored volcano, and determined that its activity was increasing, that its magma chamber dormancy was coming to an end, and that it could pose a hazard in the following decades.  Further complicating things is the fact that Changbaishan straddles the border of China and North Korea. Given such a geo-politically sensitive location, the effects of any volcanic activity here would likely be very hard to manage."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Voice of Russia today has a report titled Scottish in fear of bad weather more than terrorism. At first I thought it was about just another twisted survey to give the impression that people fear global warming climate change and the extremes it’s supposedly brings.
But when you actually read the report, you quickly discover what Scots are really far more worried about: brutal winters!
The Voice of Russia writes (my emphasis):
Nearly half of Scottish people are afraid of being clobbered by an ‘extreme weather’ emergency this winter season… . Concern has been mounting over power and water cuts, and Scots are in fear of being stuck in vehicles or trains in blizzard-like conditions.”
Here we see that the report is talking about ice-age-like winter conditions! The kind that climate scientists, like David Viner, said we’d rarely ever see again in the future.
Today 49% of Scots fear the coming winter this year. Last year the figure was 38%. Alarm over cold winters is rising rapidly.
So why are Scots getting ever more scared of brutal winters in times of purported warming?
The answer is because it hasn’t been warming at all in Europe over the last years. If anything winters have been getting harsher, more dangerous and are completely the opposite of what Europeans were told to prepare for a few years ago.

The Voice of Russia writes that Scots have fresh memories of brutal, life-threatening winter conditions (again my emphasis):

‘Severe weather can strike quickly and at any time of year. In March, we saw the impact of severe snowstorms on communities in Arran, Kintyre and Dumfries and Galloway,’ Transport minister Keith Brown said and added, ‘So whether it is making your home energy efficient, protecting your pipes, packing an emergency kit for the car or looking out for vulnerable neighbors, we can all play our part in helping Scotland get ready for winter.'”

Does this sound like people getting ready for global warming?
It also appears that Scottish citizens are losing faith in their energy supply.
It has been estimated that 28 percent experienced some delay in their gas, water, or electricity in the past year. In rural areas the percentage was much higher, at 41 percent.”

"Looking at weather maps showing the changes in temperature already occurring in Europe it is clear how lucky those are who live next to the cooling Atlantic Ocean. Even over the next three years the increased temperature gradient from west to east is quite alarming – with central Europe up to 2C hotter on average than 30 years ago. Even in Britain it is up to 1C warmer in the south-east. Ireland, Cornwall and west Wales, close to the cooling sea, are the only places where the rise is minimal. Even the Outer Hebrides and the far north of Scotland are warming appreciably because sea temperatures there have risen quite fast too.  So that everyone can prepare for the disruption that droughts, floods and extreme weather events will bring, researchers are dividing Europe up into 25km squares and developing a regional climate prognosis for each of them for the next few years. As scientists study past and present climate changes, the computer model can also calculate what the land surface temperature will be in a lattice of thousands of boxes across the earth’s surface. In Britain and Europe generally the forecasts are said to be most accurate because the sea temperatures off our west coast are the most comprehensively measured in the world. "
"Imagine, for a second, that the slice of delectable cake melting in your mouth was made with flour ground from insects not grains. Or that your most alluring perfume – a special gift, perhaps – contained reclaimed ingredients once excreted audibly from someone else’s bowels. The visceral, gut reaction you might experience in these scenarios is a consequence of their “yuck factor” or capacity to disgust. Disgust is an emotion that causes us to reject things – and that is why we may expect there to be little demand for the kind of “eau de toilette” detailed above. Disgust evolved as part of our behavioural immune system, but it also plays a role in our sexual and moral judgements. Most of the time, disgust works well. For example it encourages us not to eat spoiled food, which could make us unwell. It is, however, an extremely blunt tool. While it gives us a quick and instinctive answer on how to act, it has evolved to be an overly conservative response, which often gets things wrong. 


 Things that either imitate or have a physical or psychological connection to sources of disgust, yet cannot cause us harm, often make us feel disgusted too.  This was first demonstrated in a series of classic experiments by the psychologist Paul Rozin in the 1980s. Among other things, people in these studies were much less likely to want to eat fudge shaped as dog faeces rather than discs, or the soup from a brand new bedpan rather than a bowl. The same yuck factor is a problem for sustainable consumption. When we are presented with choices it prompts us to choose the packaged and sterilised safe-looking option – the symmetrical and unblemished apple over its ugly sister. This results in us increasing waste rather than minimising it. Our disgust response is either exploited – for example in the advertising of cleaning products – to make us feel like we need to consume more. Or it acts as an irrational barrier to sustainable solutions that are rationally OK, but automatically trigger a primitive and overly sensitive emotion system. This includes things that increase our exposure to products that do have potential to make us unwell, such as handling reusable nappies or composting. But it also makes us averse to things that won’t do us any harm, such as atypically shaped fruits and vegetables, or food made from insect proteins or purified water or medicine that have been reclaimed from sewage. These things either have features that imitate real indicators of disease (asymmetry), or have been in contact with things that could make us ill (sewage). So our disgust system misfires and is difficult to override, despite rational information that these objects are safe to consume. There are individual differences in how sensitive people are to disgust; some people are less affected than others. Plus, our disgust responses are moulded by society, so we see a lot of variation in what different cultures find disgusting, such as eating insects. Disgust is also malleable in the early years of life, so generational change in disgust responses isn’t uncommon. When disgust responses are established, however, they have been shown to be more resistant to change than other emotions such as fear. Once this has happened there are some techniques from behavioural science that can help. One approach is to reduce the disgust people feel through “masking”. For example, rather than oven-baked crickets, companies introducing insect-based foods into the UK supply-chain may rely on products made from ground insect protein with packaging that dissociates their creepy-crawly ingredients. A recent experiment in branding found that people were much more willing to use and pay more for the same product described as “recycled water” than “treated wastewater”. So presenting something in a palatable way can make all the difference. Yet, you still have the psychological problem. The idea one is eating insects or the idea one is gargling treated sewage – and ideas are sufficient to cause people to viscerally reject something. A second approach does not focus on changing how much disgust someone feels, but how they think about it. The most basic way is to educate people – get them to consider that when they feel disgusted by something whether there is a reasoned argument behind this, or a false alarm? In psychology, we call this “reappraisal”. A third approach is to exploit emotions that are generally antithetical to disgust-based rejection, such as compassion. Recent work by Nathan Consedine and colleagues at the University of Auckland shows this might work for nursing behaviours that evoke disgust. We can apply the same mechanisms here by making people feel compassion for the odd-looking fruit and vegetables that are normally wasted (“don’t leave me behind”). Or by triggering compassion for the environment, emphasising it is vulnerable and in-need or our care. So, despite our evolutionary instincts, there are ways we can overcome the yuck factor to live more sustainably. We just need to learn more about them.  Hear more about the yuck factor and how one person’s waste can be another’s treasure on The Conversation’s podcast, The Anthill."
"Germany has ambitious plans for both electric cars and renewable energy. But it can’t deliver both. As things stand, Germany’s well-meaning but contradictory ambitions would actually boost emissions by an amount comparable with the present-day emissions of the entire country of Uruguay or the state of Montana. In October 2016 the Bundesrat, the country’s upper legislative chamber, called for Germany to support a phase-out of gasoline vehicles by 2030. The resolution isn’t official government policy, but even talk of such a ban sends a strong signal towards the country’s huge car industry. So what if Germany really did go 100% electric by 2030? To environmentalists, such a change sounds perfect. After all, road transport is responsible for a big chunk of our emissions and replacing regular petrol vehicles with electric cars is a great way to cut the carbon footprint. But it isn’t that simple. The basic problem is that an electric car running on power generated by dirty coal or gas actually creates more emissions than a car that burns petrol. For such a switch to actually reduce net emissions, the electricity that powers those cars must be renewable. And, unless things change, Germany is unlikely to have enough green energy in time. After all, news of the potential petrol car ban came just after the chancellor, Angela Merkel, had announced she would slow the expansion in new wind farms as too much intermittent renewable power was making the grid unstable. Meanwhile, after Fukushima, Germany has pledged to retire its entire nuclear reactor fleet by 2022.  In an analysis published in Nature, my colleague Harry Hoster and I have looked at how Germany’s electricity and transport policies are intertwined. They each serve the noble goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Yet, when combined, they might actually lead to increased emissions. We investigated what it would take for Germany to keep to its announcements and fully electrify its road transportation – and what that would mean for emissions. Our research shows that you can’t simply erase fossil fuels from both energy and transport in one go, as Germany may be about to find out. It’s certainly true that replacing internal combustion vehicles with electric ones would overnight lead to a huge reduction in Germany’s energy needs. This is because electric cars are far more efficient. When petrol is burned, just 30% or less of the energy released is actually used to move the car forwards – the rest goes into exhaust heat, water pumps and other inefficiencies. Electric cars do lose some energy through recharging their batteries, but overall at least 75% goes into actual movement.  Each year, German vehicles burn around 572 terawatt-hour (TWh)‘s worth of liquid fuels. Based on the above efficiency savings, a fully electrified road transport sector would use around 229 TWh. So Germany would use less energy overall (as petrol is a source of energy) but it would need an astonishing amount of new renewable or nuclear generation. And there is another issue: Germany also plans to phase out its nuclear power plants, ideally by 2022, but 2030 at the latest. This creates a further void of 92TWh to be filled. Adding up the extra renewable electricity needed to power millions of cars, and that required to replace nuclear plants, gives us a total of 321 TWh of new generation required by 2030. That’s equivalent to dozens of massive new power stations. Even if renewable energy expands at the maximum rate allowed by Germany’s latest plan, it will still only cover around 63 TWh of what’s required. Hydro, geothermal and biomass don’t suffer from the same intermittency problems as wind or solar, yet the country is already close to its potential in all three. This therefore means the rest of the gap – an enormous 258 TWh – will have to be filled by coal or natural gas. That is the the current total electricity consumption of Spain, or ten Irelands.  Germany could choose to fill the gap entirely with coal or gas plants. However, relying entirely on coal would lead to further annual emissions of 260 million tonnes of carbon dioxide while gas alone would mean 131m tonnes. By comparison, German road transport currently emits around 156m tonnes of CO2, largely from car exhausts. Therefore, unless the electricity shortfall is filled almost entirely with new natural gas plants, Germany could switch to 100% electric cars and it would still end up with a net increase in emissions.  The above chart shows a more realistic scenario where half of the necessary electricity for electric cars would come from new gas plants and half from new coal plants. We have assumed both coal and gas would become 25% more efficient. In this relatively likely scenario, the emissions of the road transportation sector actually increase by 20%, or 32 million tonnes of CO2 (comparable to Uruguay or Montana’s annual emissions). If Germany really does want a substantial reduction in vehicle emissions, its energy and transport policies must work in sync. Instead of capping new solar plants or wind farms, it should delay the nuclear phase-out and focus on getting better at predicting electricity demand and storing renewable energy."
"What does a staple food such as bread have to do with global warming? For a start, to make loaves on an industrial scale, you’ll need powerful milling and kneading machines and a huge oven, heated to 230℃ or more. This uses a lot of energy. The flour, yeast and salt must also be shipped in and, finally, the finished loaves are delivered to stores – all in trucks powered by petrol. But it isn’t milling or baking or transport that accounts for most of the environmental impact of bread. In a new a study published in the journal Nature Plants, colleagues and I looked at the entire supply chain of a regular loaf – from seed to sandwich, via mill and bakery. We found that more than half its environmental impact arises not from food processing but from the production of the raw material, the wheat grain.  Food causes about a third of total greenhouse gas emissions. Yet the supply chains can be so complex that it is difficult to determine what part of the process is responsible – and without this information neither the industry nor consumers will know what to do about it. This is why it’s useful to take a zoomed-out look at the entire process. Thanks to a collaboration with a bread manufacturer we had accurate “primary” data for every stage of their particular brand of 800g loaf. We found that ammonium nitrate fertiliser alone accounts for 43% of all the greenhouse gas emissions, dwarfing all other processes in the supply chain including baking and milling. These emissions arise from the large amounts of energy and natural gas needed to produce fertiliser, and from the nitrous oxide released when it is degraded in the soil. For crops to grow big and fast, they need nitrogen, usually through fertiliser. It is the key ingredient of intensive agriculture. Without fertiliser, either we produce less food or we use much more land to produce the same amount, at greater economic and environmental cost. That is the fix we are in.  We could reduce the use of fertiliser by recycling agricultural and human waste as manure, in order to retain the nitrogen in the same cycle. We could also harness the best of organic farming by, for example, using “green manures” or rotating crops with legumes that “fix” nitrogen in the soil. Precision agriculture can be used to only apply fertiliser where and when it is needed, using new sensor technologies including drones to monitor the nutritional status of soils and plants. And we can even develop new varieties of crops that are able to use nitrogen more efficiently by, for instance, harnessing fungi in the soil or getting soil microbes to release less nitrous oxide.  But technology isn’t the only solution – we could also change our diets. Meat, in particular, is a very inefficient use of nitrogen, as cows or chickens use up energy and nutrients simply staying alive before being slaughtered.  Cereal crops such as wheat are a much more efficient way of converting nitrogenous fertiliser into nitrogen in food protein. Studies show emphatically that low-meat diets are also good for the environment. But whose responsibility is it to reduce fertiliser use? After all, fingers could be pointed at the fertiliser manufacturer, the farmer, or even the retailers and consumers who demand cheap bread. With goods like electronics or car tyres there is a growing recognition for a notion of extended producer responsibility where manufacturers are held responsible for the continuing impact of their products, often including disposal. This could be extended to fertilisers too. Consumers could pay more for “greener bread” or apply pressure to use less fertiliser. But things can be confusing as people are usually entirely unaware of the environmental impacts embodied in the products they consume. This is particularly the case for food, where the mains concerns are over human health or animal welfare – not emissions. Many will be surprised that wheat cultivation has a greater environmental impact than baking or milling. This highlights one of the key conflicts in the food security challenge. The agriculture industry’s primary purpose is to make money, not to provide sustainable food for the whole world. Profits for farmers and retailers rely on highly productive crops – which require lots of relatively cheap fertiliser. However the environmental impact of this fertiliser is not costed within the system and so there are currently no real incentives to fix things.  Feeding seven billion people fairly and sustainably is therefore not only a question of technology but also one of political economy. We need incentives to use less fertiliser – and we could start with bread."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThings are worse than we thought when it comes to renewable energy in Europe. Online Forbes has an article titled: Requiem For Spanish Wind?
The pain in Spain cannot be sustained. That’s the conclusion of the Spanish government, which is slashing its subsidies for wind power and other renewable energy as part of a deficit-fighting move. Spain is the latest European country to cut subsidies for clean energy — following similar moves in the U.K., Germany and Italy — because they’re driving up costs for consumers. […]
It’s a sad end for a program once heralded as a model by the Obama administration for its own renewables initiative. Yet it’s also not a surprising one. […] Without government subsidies, it simply isn’t a viable business.

Germans thinking twice about sacrificing natural beauty
Meanwhile Germany’s online Spiegel is also taking a critical look at Germany’s wind industry in a piece (in English) called Eco-Blowback: Mutiny in the Land of Wind Turbines. It’s a good summation of how the wind energy is doing in Germany so far. Public resistance is reaching ever higher levels.
With the prime coastal locations already taken, operators are increasingly turning their attention to areas further inland. Even valuable tourist regions — such as the Moselle valley, the Allgäu and the foothills of the Alps — are to be sacrificed. […]

Michael Succow, a prominent German environmentalist and winner of the Alternative Nobel Prize, is also threatening to abandon ship. He fears soulless stretches of land and lost tranquility. […]
And his fears are not unfounded. Back in the 1980s, tree-huggers put up Aeroman wind turbines in their front yards — but those days are long gone. Just the masts of today’s wind turbines can reach up to 160 meters high. When active, they kill so many insects that the sticky mass slows the rotors down.

Moselle, Allgäu, foothills of the Alps? Nothing like sacrificing national and natural treasures for the sake of a neurotic climate obsession.
And I wonder how long it’s going to take other countries before they wake up and notice this isn’t working out. My home state of Vermont, for example, is planning to install an array of solar panels along an interstate. I wonder who is going to shovel the snow off 6 months a year? It’s amazing how duped and caught up with an idea seemingly intelligent people can get.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe latest Greenpeace activist has been denied bail by a Russian court in the Arctic port city of Murmansk.
The online Mail here features photos of a young Greenpeace woman-activist behind bars – the face of innocence. Greenpeace portrays itself as the moral and ethical conscience of the planet and insists it is simply an innocent victim of a state that is greedily attempting to exploit a virgin region.
The latest to be denied bail is 27 year-old Briton Alexandra Harris. Harris is among the youngest of the 30 arrested. Now that she has been denied bail, there is little hope of any of the 30 activists getting released. This is truly a tragic development, especially for the younger, naïve activists. They will now get plenty of time to reflect on how they wound up doing long, hard time in a Russian prison.
With time they may come to realize that they had been enticed by a Greenpeace deal: accept hate in exchange for the title of “moral champion of the globe”. An irresistible deal for any soul in the possession of a young, naïve, or just plain dim mind.
Greenpeace is not a peaceful organization. It is one of violence, condescending intolerance, and confrontation, all hiding behind a guise of moral superiority. It recruits the young, teaches them to hate opposing views and to never compromise with them. It rejects dialogue, always claiming the discussion is over and that they are the ultimate keepers of the truth. Greenpeace teaches the young that they can justify acts of violence and law-breaking by simply claiming moral superiority and the struggle for a noble cause.
Perhaps the young activists will come to realize in a few months (or years) that they had been brainwashed into thinking they were environmental saints who in reality had only been used as publicity pawns for a multi-million dollar publicity machine. What moral, peaceful organization does the following to the young?

What’s the difference between the boy above and the following radicalized Islamic boy?

I’d say there is very little difference. Both rants are based on religious faith, both children are irreversibly convinced they are the keepers of the Truth, both have been filled with hatred, both are very angry, and both had been programmed by a powerful organization.
Today Greenpeace higher-ups are all acting indignant that their members would be locked up in prison, under harsh conditions even, and insist their protesters were peaceful and were only demonstrating to rescue the planet’s future. “Does this young girl really look like a pirate to you?” …”Alex is a caring, sensitive person, who cares for the environmental future of  the planet.” … “She was on board the Arctic Sunrise as part of a peaceful protest, in international waters, in the radio room doing her job.”
Greenpeace executive director Kumi Naidoo calls the charge of piracy “absurd”. After all, the highest moral conscience and authority on the planet would never engage in such activity. 
Naidoo appears to have never bothered reading the Law of the Sea. Legally Greenpeace executives acted recklessly. Now one of their crews has to pay a massive price for it. Could Greenpeace lawyers and executives be sued for legal incompetence?
Naidoo adds:
Now these 30 people are prisoners of conscience and we are all responsible for their fate.”
Now we are all responsible. In Naidoo’s mind, all of humanity must follow, without questioning, his belief, his Truth. This man is a dangerous egomaniac who has completely lost his marbles.
The families of all young Greenpeace activists would be wise to wake up to this quickly.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSpiegel journalist and geologist Axel Bojanowski reports on a heated climate debate in the online Spiegel today.

Climate scientist Daniela Jacob (left) completely overpowered by Vahrenholt (right) in debate in Hamburg. Jacob admitted climate models and science are filled with uncertainty, concedes model failure. Photo Jacob: climate-service-center.en.  Photo Vahrenholt: RWE.
Professor Fritz Vahrenholt, one of the fathers of the modern environmental movement, and today persona non grata for having published a skeptical climate science book last year, met IPCC climate scientist Daniela Jacob in a head-to-head debate before an audience of 100 at the Scandic Hotel in Hamburg yesterday evening. The debate was organized by Angela Merkel’s CDU Christian Democratic Party.
Vahrenholt trounced the former NCAR scientist, who was broken down into making a number of admissions.
Spiegel writes in the photo caption:
Unusual debate at the CDU in Hamburg: A renowned climatologist debates scientist critic and RWE supervisory board member Fritz Vahrenholt. The dispute reveals a new stage in the handling of climate prognoses.”
The days of uncritical acceptance of climate prognoses are over. The trust is gone. Open criticism of climate science is gaining traction in Germany as climate prognoses from renowned institutes are being viewed by the public and media with increasing skepticism. Spiegel writes:
After Vahrenholt and Jacob each made a presentation and duked it out in a heated dispute, the duel appeared to decide: “When the climate models do not agree with the reality”, Vahrenholt thundered, “then reality is not what’s false!”
Hostile audiences are becoming a thing of the past for climate skeptics – even among the generally climate alarmist CDU conservative party audiences. The overall reaction by the Hamburg audience signals a growing, pent-up resentment among Germans as the inkling that the climate catastrophe is more charade than fact begins to sink in.
Failed climate models “the wound of climate science”
In its article, Spiegel calls the growing disagreement between model results and measured observations “the wound of climate science“.  Spiegel writes on Vahrenholt’s claim of faulty models:
With that statement Vahrenholt bored into the wound of climate science: For 15 years the global mean temperature has remained stagnant, the computer models had not foreseen the warming pause. The models could not reproduce the surprising temperature trend, reported climatologists surrounding Hans von Storch of the Helmholtz-Zentrum GKSS in a new study. The probability that the simulations in this respect are faulty is higher than 98 percent. The climate catastrophe is refuted, believes Vahrenholt, who made his audacious claims into a bestseller.”

That German establishment-shaking bestseller is now coming in English in September: North America and UK. And there are discussions to have the book out in Polish.
Vahrenholt scoffed at the excuse that the oceans had swallowed up the heat, saying it was not credible. Jacob even desperately had to cite the Bible to explain the missing heat: “We know this already from the Bible: Seven goods years follow seven bad years.”
Prognoses with “concrete numbers was an error”
Jacob reluctantly had to admit the shortcomings with the models, blaming poor communication for the model failures: “We do however have to improve the communication with the public,” Jacob admitted. “One error was giving out concrete figures for the prognoses.” She then conceded that we ought not be surprised that the models projections were wrong and that there’s lots of uncertainty, adding: “In the economy and in a marriage they aren’t any better.”
Untypical for an IPCC scientist, Jacob also admitted that the models exaggerated. “I don’t think highly of that. we all have learned from it.”
Why did no scientist intervene?
With that admission, Bojanowski writes that Vahrenholt didn’t pass up the opportunity to capitalize, loudly demanding:
Why is it then, when panic was rampant, no moderate climate scientist intervened? … You too must sometimes publicly distance yourselves from the agitators at the Potsdam-Institute, Frau Jacob!”
Applause from the audience, Bojanwski writes. Vahrenholt continued:
The catastrophic heightening of some scientists now threatens to destroy Germany as a place to do business.  … 1000 billion euros for the Energiewende, who is going to pay for it?”
Good question. And what does a scientist feeding on the public trough like Jacob care? Her answer, Spiegel writes:
 I makes statements in my field of study as a scientist, and not politically.”
Germany is slowly awakening.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe online Schleswig Holstein Zeitung (SHZ) here features an interview with prominent IPCC climate scientist Professor Hans von Storch titled: A climate scientist against the spread of panic.
Hans von Storch also runs the respected Klimazwiebel blog and has at one time or another harshly criticized both sides of the climate debate. See yesterday’s NTZ story here.
Climate science losing its credibility
In the SHZ interview, the introduction writes as follows with regards to extreme weather events:
Climate scientists Hans von Storch, Director of the Helmholtz Center for Coastal Research in Geeshacht, fears that all of climate science will lose its credibility if panic keeps being spread.”
Haiyun no record storm
On whether Haiyun is a wake-up call for policymakers, von Storch reminds us that “extreme events are all part of normal weather” and that Haiyan was no record storm and that there has been no unusual increased frequency in the region over the last years. This storm can hardly be understood as a sign of man-made climate change.”
Models may have underestimated natural factors
On the models inadequate performance over the last 15 years, von Storch believes that the models may have underestimated natural factors like the sun, or that CO2 has been overrated. But he also says he sees no reason to discard the models altogether.
Acid rain scientists lost much of their credibility
Later in the interview von Storch gives his opinion on the acid-rain forest-die-off scare of the 1980s. He thinks that because of the unwarranted hysteria, few people today listen at all to forest scientists, and that he would prefer that “climate science should not become a Greenpeace arm of the government.”

Some scientists think they are keepers of the truth
Next the SHZ asks von Storch how it can be that some of his colleagues have succumbed to panic spreading. Hans von Storch:
We can think of other people in the 20th century who felt compelled to create a better world and who thought they were the keepers of a higher truth. In our case there are some that think they can derive this privilege from the scientific. Improving the world and people here mostly end up on the wayside.
I don’t believe this is the majority of climate scientists. There are a few especially visible climate scientists who are pushing such thoughts.”
Some climate scientists are abusing climate science
Hans von Storch then adds that he feels that “us scientists have to take the subject seriously and not to abuse it as a vehicle for fundamental world and population improvement.”
Fracking as an “effective bridge technology”
At the end of the interview, Hans von Storch offers some support for fracking, citing the USA’s fracking for natural gas, which he says has made a considerable contribution to “decreasing the US CO2 emissions” and calls it an effective bridge technology.
In Germany this measure is being almost unanimously rejected – obviously decreasing CO2 is ‘good’ only under certain conditions”.
In summary, more harsh criticism and even words of warning from Hans von Storch aimed at alarmist scientists and the overzealous policymakers who feel compelled to rush through a fundamental transformation of global society in a fit of panic.

"Most people would agree that living more sustainably is something to strive for. With £13bn worth of food being wasted each year in the UK and global temperature records being broken every three years, being green is more important than ever. But it’s a lot easier said than done. For the vast majority, trying to live a more sustainable lifestyle is restricted to the weekly recycling of bottles, paper, plastics and food waste. And consuming less also represents a tricky issue for governments when consuming more this year than last year drives economic growth. An enduring issue remains: what actually is “sustainability” and what does “consuming sustainably” mean in the first place? As David Harvey has pointed out, it can mean almost anything people want it to mean.  In its simplest form, though, sustainable consumption asks that people consider the impact their choices (when it comes to buying things or using energy) will have on future generations’ ability to make their choices. Sadly, the likelihood of the majority acting in this way is small. Most of their everyday consumption choices are made habitually or emotionally and not rationally. As Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman noted, people are prone to think fast, driven by our habits and intuitions – and not slowly or thoughtfully.  So: how can governments, NGOs – even businesses themselves – encourage people to consume in a more sustainable manner? Currently, the dominant logic is to provide people with more information so they can make more informed decisions about what they spend their money on.   While this may succeed for a minority, in this view information is assumed to be a precursor to changing people’s attitudes and – in due course – their behaviour. The problem is that there is little evidence that information provision does this at all. It’s also problematic, as people suffer from information overload. Too much information can cause confusion and, if it’s not relevant to them, people will simply ignore it. However, even people who’ve taken on board the sustainability message find difficulty in practising it. This finding emerged from data collected by one of our former PhD students Cristina Longo (now a researcher at the University of Lille’s business school). To understand the trials and tribulations of trying to live more sustainably, Longo conducted an ethnographic study and embedded herself in the local Transition Network community, a movement that promotes sustainable living.  She spent two years hanging out with people already highly knowledgeable and committed to living a sustainable lifestyle. She attended talks and meetings, and participated in guerrilla gardening, taking care of neglected public spaces, before interviewing members of the community. Our analysis of these interviews highlighted some major problems when it comes to living out sustainable values – even when you’ve got the best intentions. The paradox of sustainable consumption appears to be that the more you are aware of the issues at stake, the harder you find it to actually live out your values.  The more knowledgeable people become with regard to the myriad issues surrounding sustainability, the more this knowledge becomes a source of dilemma. For example, Tessa, a member of the Transition Network with a longstanding interest and understanding of sustainability issues, told us of her “green beans from Kenya dilemma”. For her, green beans from Kenya were definitely a no-no, because of the food miles incurred in flying the beans over. However, she found the clarity she had on this position was undermined when she learned of the social and economic benefits of growing green beans for the local Kenyan farmers. Also, for those already committed to sustainability ideals, not being able to live up to them becomes a source of considerable tension. Veronica, for example, recounted a story about a talk she’d given on reducing carbon footprints. Afterwards, she drove past a family who’d been at the meeting, who were cycling. Being confronted with not practising what she was preaching was very disconcerting for her. Irene, too, wants to eat locally sourced organic food whenever possible, but on her limited budget finds it expensive to do so. This existential tension that both Veronica and Irene experience is in large part self-inflicted. We’ve found that the more knowledgeable people become, the more it can result in paralysis or the inability to act on one’s sustainability ideals or goals. One informant Kate described a knowledge tipping point. As she accumulated more and more knowledge that she attempted to put into practice, she also experienced an awareness that her efforts would ultimately be unsustainable. Judith experienced something similar too but saw her failure – in her case to not buy anything shipped over from China – as part of an overall learning process. Clearly, being a sustainable consumer is problematic and embedding sustainable ideals into everyday life is fraught with difficulties. Until society’s obsession with growth is addressed at a much wider level, sustainable consumption remains a fantasy."
"The world is noisy.  In cities, we find ourselves constantly surrounded by the moan of motors, the screech of sirens, and the prattle of people. So much so, that we often crave the peace and quiet of the countryside.  But silence is hard to find, even in nature. Animals chirp, roar, squeak, squawk, and howl to attract mates, defend territories, locate prey or even just find their way around. Wind whistles, rain hammers and streams gurgle. The sea thunders. Even under the water’s surface, a cacophony of unknown snaps, boings, ripples and other melodies still surround you.  Together, this symphony is the natural soundscape.  Scientists can use acoustic sensors to monitor anything from an entire soundscape all the way down to a single species. Acoustic monitoring has helped us learn more about the behaviour and ecology of animals such as whales, dolphins, birds, amphibians, insects and bats.  Bats, the subject of my own research, are ideal candidates for acoustic monitoring. Famously, they use echolocation to navigate through the skies, but they also produce feeding buzzes to hunt down prey, and social calls to attract mates.  Monitoring the distinct calls bats use for navigation, prey location and socialising allows us to determine where they are and what they are using particular habitats for. Sensors are often placed outside roosts, along suspected commuting routes and in foraging locations. Currently sensors are too large to be attached to the bats themselves. Studies using acoustic sensors have furthered our knowledge of how these animals are responding to pressures such as climate change and habitat loss. The UK’s National Bat Monitoring Program – a citizen science project that has been running since 1997 – relies on volunteers across the country armed with bat detectors to carry out annual acoustic surveys.  This valuable data has revealed some promising population increases of many threatened bat species.  Zooming out from individual species, a new field of research has recently emerged called soundscape ecology. This is the study of the entire collection of sounds that are emitted from a landscape. Scientists group these sounds into those created by humans (known as anthrophony), those emitted by plants and animals (biophony), and natural but non-biological sounds like rain wind and waves (geophony). Humans often don’t consider sound as an important part of an ecosystem, but other animals are not so oblivious. For instance, the tiny larvae of reef fish use the clamour of fish and crustaceans calls from coral reefs to determine which one they should grow up on. And just as the ambient sound can tell the larvae about the health of a reef, we can also use sound as a way to monitor the status of the environment. As microphones get smaller, cheaper and better at storing data, they are becoming an ever more viable tool for a variety of conservation projects. Acoustic sensors are particularly effective in remote environments where access is limited, and have huge potential for monitoring illegal poaching. In Cameroon’s Korup National Park, where monkeys and chimpanzees are targeted for bushmeat, sensors have already been successfully used to identify target areas for anti-poaching patrols, by recording the location of gunshots and animal calls. Similarly, acoustic sensors may be valuable for monitoring illegal blast fishing in the sea, where dynamite is dropped into the water and the explosion stuns or kills everything in range. This form of fishing has a horrific impact on ocean ecosystems, decimating fragile corals. These aren’t real-time reporting systems, for now – the data must be collected and analysed to identify particular sounds. However, with the technology rapidly advancing, automatic detection systems may be possible in the not too distant future, enabling real-time reporting of illegal poaching or fishing. With biodiversity in decline globally, acoustic monitoring is a highly-effective, efficient and low-cost way to gather the data required to prevent further losses. In the future, we may have huge networks of acoustic sensors monitoring the natural world, feeding us live information. We humans are highly visual animals, but we should remember to take the time to close our eyes and open our ears to the orchestra of the natural world around us."

Share this...FacebookTwitterPIK scientist Stefan Rahmstorf at Twitter directs our attention to an interview he gave on German Public Radio.
The interview is about new models that predict the frequency of heat waves globally will double in the next seven years alone, i.e. by 2020, and quadruple again by 2040. I wrote about this yesterday here.
In the interview Rahmstorf says “the probability of experiencing extreme weather events multiplied over the last decades, simply as a consequence of global warming.” Rahmstorf then explains how models have discovered this:
Colleagues looked: Today’s climate models can well reproduce this trend of increasing heat extremes in the past. And as you have confirmed, they used these models to look into the future and have determined that these heat extremes will double by the year 2020 and then once again quadruple in frequency by the year 2050.”
Here Rahmstorf claims that if a model is able to reproduce the past, then it can reproduce the future. Just forget that any model can be made to reproduce the past and then project any future you so desire. Rahmstorf is sounding more and more like a swindler selling phony fortune-telling services with each passing interview. And above I understand from his words a frequency increase of 8 times.
German Public Radio moderator Fecke then asked what exactly makes the projections so robust? Rahmstorf:
Robust is that we use the measured data of the last 130 years and look at how well the newest generation of climate models, that is the complete range that we have from the various research groups from the whole world, can reproduce the past. And it has been determined that they can do this very well, and for this reason we are confident that the results are also robust for the future development.”
Good hindsight automatically means good foresight?

How good were the “old” models? Here’s what the IPCC told us late last year:

Not very good at all. Worse, Hans von Storch and his colleagues just assessed the performance of the climate models. Here’s the result:
…for the 15-year trend interval corresponding to the latest observation period 1998-2012 , only 2% of the 62 CMIP5 and less than 1% of the 189 CMIP3trend computations are as low as or lower than the observed trend.”
That’s Epic failure.
But I guess these were just the “old models”. Rahmstorf is now talking about a “new generation” of super-tuned models, which are now more robust than ever.
But does it really matter how new or how old the models are? The only fact that matters is that temperatures haven’t risen at all in 15 years, and if that trend continues, then Rahmtorf’s much ballyhooed new generation of robust models are going to be just as wrong. Heat waves aren’t going to quadruple should temperatures remain stagnant or fall.
Finally, it’s worth noting that Rahmstorf, and the likes of him, have quit talking about the global mean temperature. Instead they are using a new yardstick for measuring global warming: the undefined vague frequency of weather events. No alarmist wants to talk about the global mean temperature anymore.

"Doris sounds like the sort of name your grandmother might have. It’s not particularly scary. But the name now has a rather different association, after “Storm Doris” tore through the UK. The Met Office, the UK’s national weather forecaster, put much of the country on “amber alert” and reported 94mph gusts along with severe rain and snow. The Met Office first warned about Doris several days earlier, while it was still travelling across the North Atlantic. The idea is that giving storms human names makes them easy to remember and talk about, meaning people are more aware and prepared when they hit – certainly more prepared than if faced by a generic “high wind forecast”. This is the second winter season in which the Met Office has run a pilot scheme to name these events. Each summer, it announces a list of names, alternating between male and female in alphabetical order, and the moment a new storm is spotted it acquires the next name on the list. Doris is the 15th storm to be named – and the fourth this season. The Met Office’s thinking is that names will better communicate dangerous, high-impact weather events to the public, and can thus streamline the warning system. Storm naming was first introduced in 1945 for Pacific typhoons and was quickly picked up by the World Meteorology Organisation and in Europe and America. It is now very common across the world. Just think of “celebrities” such as Katrina, Sandy or Yolanda – the Philippine name for the incredibly destructive Typhoon Haiyan (itself a Chinese name). The larger British storms often pick up unofficial names anyway. For instance, the 2013 “St Judes Day” storm  that travelled across southern England or the 2012 “Toon Monsoon” in Newcastle. But because these events are named after they have happened, different media outlets can confuse the issue by calling them different things – the Newcastle storm, for instance, was also dubbed “Thunder Thursday”.  By having a predetermined list that runs from Angus to Wilbert, the Met Office can name the storm before it hits, allowing a clear and more powerful warning.  While the public and media consider any severe weather event to be a storm, the term has a much more specific meaning in meteorology (winds 10 or above on the Beaufort scale – that’s 55mph, or 89kmh). This meant heavy rainstorms with little wind could slip through unnamed and unhyped, despite the risk of floods. Indeed, heavy flooding just after Christmas 2015 was incorrectly attributed to Storm Frank when it actually came from nameless rainfall – exactly the sort of confusion the names were meant to avoid in the first place. The Met Office has therefore had to relax its definition of what constitutes a “storm”. This season, all high-impact weather events are named.  The most obvious benefit is that a name generates an instant hashtag and search term: However, there are deeper effects, of which many people won’t even be conscious. Psychologists have shown that naming nonhuman agents and giving them human characteristics has a positive effect on recall and can affect behaviour as we seem to react with the same automatic behaviour to nonhumans assigned personality traits as we would to humans with the same personality traits.  It seems people really are more likely to be aware of Doris or Angus than a nameless storm warning – and indeed the Met’s own research backs this up: a recent YouGov survey has shown that storm naming has influenced behaviour with most people “taking action in some way upon hearing about a named storm”. The choice of name can also influence perception. For instance, more masculine names and harder to pronounce names are perceived as riskier. Naming is such a powerful technique that some scientists even want to adopt it for diseases and epidemics. Naming storms is fundamentally about communicating risk. Successful warning systems are based on reliable and effective partnerships between forecasters, the media and emergency planners. Storm naming has an important role to play in the communication of an event, but that is not the same as communicating what action should be taken. While the storm naming scheme has fostered cooperation between the Irish Met Éireann and the UK Met Office, continued and improved collaboration between all agencies involved in natural hazard management is needed to reduce impact further."

Hat-tip: Marc Morano at Climate Depot
That path is one of arrogance, a despise for the will of the people, leadership failure, and eventual civil strife that could shatter a nation.
I disagree with Marc Morano on one point above. This isn’t brilliant, it’s desperate and frightening.

Krauthammer: “appalling…scandalous” 
Charles Krauthammer, a doctor of psychiatry, calls Sally Jewell’s most recent comments about “climate change deniers” in her department:
…shockingly arrogant and anti-scientific. The idea that science is closed and that a science is settled, and that anybody who brings evidence and questions it, is suddenly somehow a flat-earther is appalling. … The idea of science is that you are open to contrary evidence. It’s the definition of a scientific theory. And particularly climate science, which is young and is new – it’s built on all kinds of assumptions and data which contradict each other. The idea that it is a closed issue is incredibly unscientific and arrogant. And that these bureaucrats and political hacks are decreeing this is scandalous.”

I’ve never been a fan of Obama, but he won the elections and I thought he deserved his chance to lead. But with his latest attitude, he is clearly proving himself to be unfit to be the leader of democracy and looking more and more qualified to lead Burma.

"I pointed out last weekend Scott Morrison spends a large proportion of his time doing two things: talking about how bad Labor is in the hope voters will conclude they made the correct choice in returning him to government in May, and trying to be relatable to people who don’t like politics and tune in as little as they have to. As a subset of these two objectives, Morrison speaks constantly about how stable and dependable his government is (as opposed to his political opponents, who are cast as reckless and engaged in headless chookery).  In order to nail the requisite talking point, backbenchers rise loyally, one after the other, every question time, and ask the dear leader and his cabinet colleagues to explain how calm and wise the government is. Morrison has these formulations read out each sitting day by willing automatons, who periodically inject a lilt or a Pinteresque pause into their questions, like they are at a Toastmasters session at the local Rotary club. Those of us forced to watch this pantomime daily do periodically worry this could be a plot to drive us all bonkers; to force the journalists of the Canberra press gallery to flee, screaming, from the building, leaving them to whatever they want to cook up. But in reality the government couldn’t give a stuff about us, whether we persist or whether we flee – it is speaking over our heads, to the voters. By hammering these messages, Morrison wants one thought to penetrate the great national switch-off: he wants voters to trust him. He wants voters to believe he is a man of his word, that he means what he says, and follows through on commitments. It seems an audacious strategy for a leader in an age when people are inclined to think all politicians stink, but that’s what Morrison wants. Trust. With that thought in mind, it was interesting this week to watch one small exchange in Senate estimates exposing a measurable gap between the prime minister’s rhetoric and actions. Readers will remember Morrison took some heat at the Pacific Islands Forum earlier in the year when he presented as insufficiently empathetic about the threat the climate emergency posed to the region. There were some harsh words. But at the end of the day, despite all the thundering and virtue signalling on the greatness of coal, Australia signed on to a communique that was actually pretty forward leaning on climate change. As I noted at the time, despite all the arm twisting in Tuvalu, Morrison did, in the end, sign up to a statement that committed Australia to pursuing efforts to limit global warming to 1.5C, and to produce a 2050 strategy by 2020 – no small things. This 2050 strategy, the statement said, “may include commitments and strategies to achieve net zero carbon by 2050”. Navigating that harmonious landing point with Pacific leaders was, presumably, an important gesture for an Australian prime minister fond of calling his counterparts in the region “family”. But Labor’s Senate leader, Penny Wong, during this week’s Senate estimates hearings, decided to do a little bit of due diligence about what Australia had actually signed up to at the Pacific Islands Forum, and whether we actually meant it. With foreign affairs department officials arrayed before her, Wong asked first whether or not Australia had sought any reservations or exceptions to the PIF communique (which just means did we opt out of any part of the statement). Kathy Klugman, the official responsible for Pacific strategy, said no exceptions had been sought. When it came to the PIF communique, Australia was all in. Having established that we were all in, Wong professed some curiosity that the Morrison government had signed a communique declaring that a “climate change crisis” was facing Pacific Island nations, when the Coalition rejects that language at home as alarmism. Were we on board with that bit – the climate crisis? Klugman replied that Australia had signed the declaration and “we associate ourselves with all parts of it, including that part”. Wong then asked whether the government agreed that emissions needed to be reduced to net zero by 2050 in order to achieve the goals articulated in the PIF declaration. Things then got a bit stickier. Clare Walsh, a deputy secretary of the department, joined the conversation. Walsh noted that achieving net zero emissions by 2050 was “an aspiration by some countries”. But the Australian government had not signed on to that “in terms of its domestic application”, she said. Wong then translated. So we’ve associated ourselves with that objective internationally in this communique, but would not take the requisite action domestically? Walsh ploughed on. She said the PIF declaration recognised the importance of that issue to the Pacific and recognised net zero by 2050 as a “commonly referenced target – but it isn’t one that Australia has signed up to domestically, no”. Wong then wondered why Australia had signed up to a document which said pursuing global efforts to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels was “critical to the security of our Blue Pacific” when Australia’s domestic emissions reduction targets – the ones we’ve signed on to as part of the Paris agreement – were not consistent with achieving the 1.5C objective. Was the government planning to increase the level of ambition to square those circles, Wong wondered? “There is no change to the government’s policy senator,” noted the foreign minister, Marise Payne, who was at the table. Wong evidently thought she’d reached the moment to deliver the moral of the story. “So we go along to the PIF and tell them we think 1.5C is important but we are not prepared to put targets on the table that are anywhere near consistent with it – just so we are clear about what we are doing,” she said. Payne replied that Wong could “put it in those terms” but the government had been very clear it was persisting with the policies it took to the election. So, to cut a long story short, Morrison has signed a document with Pacific leaders, with the “family”, that suggests we are as one when it comes to managing the risks of climate change, yet in reality we have very different policies, goals and objectives. It pays to remember things like this when our prime minister asks you to trust him. Katharine Murphy is Guardian Australia’s political editor"

Share this...FacebookTwitterSpiegel, for the first time that I can recall, reports on how sea ice in Antarctica refuses to melt and has reached a new maximum record.
Antarctica’s record level sea ice is troubling those who were earlier convinced of the global warming science. Slowly, reluctantly, they are beginning to realize that something is wrong with the science. …

Spiegel writes that at the end of September NASA recorded a record maximum sea ice extent of 19.47 million square kilometers meters, the most since satellite measurements began 30 years ago.
This is an inconvenient development for global warming alarmists, who are now finding themselves scrambling for explanations.
Spiegel writes “when ice in the north and south pole are discussed, then it’s usually about melting caused by global warming. However, sea ice in the Antarctic, contrary to the Arctic, has proven to be amazingly robust.” Spiegel can hardly conceal its disbelief.
One scientist who is scrambling and who is visibly baffled is meteorologist Walt Meier, who seems irritated by the new puzzling Antarctic sea ice record – the second in 2 years. In the Spiegel report, he attempts to play it all down by claiming that the record amount is “only 3.6% over the 1981-2010 mean“. Meier adds: “This year the edge of the ice extends out only 35 kilometers further than an average year.”

Baffled scientists left to speculate
Walt Meier is on the defensive, and insists the Antarctic ice sheet is getting thinner- especially West Antarctica. Spiegel adds that scientists are baffled by the sea ice increase, writing that it’s “a riddle“.
According to Spiegel, “scientists suspect that a change in atmospheric currents may explain for the most part the increase in Antarctic sea ice over the last decade.” So now atmospheric air currents have teamed up with the oceans to eat up the heat.  Strange how whenever it melts in the Arctic, it’s a sure sign of man-made global warming. But when it freezes in the Antarctic, it’s a real mystery!
Spiegel floats another possible explanation for the mysterious Antarctic sea ice behavior: ocean currents of cool surface water refrigerating the Antarctic and gobbling up any heat down there. Another explanation, Spiegel writes, could be melt water from the ice sheet flowing through huge canals in the ice that end up cooling the sea surface temperature.
That of course is like saying the warming is cooling Antarctica (with melt water)! In climate science anything is possible. Anything goes.

"It will probably come as little surprise that recent surveys have found the majority of adults in Europe think that international terrorism is the most pressing threat to the continent. Though this is valuable information about what adults think, little is known about what children and young people perceive as the greatest threats to life and democracy in Europe. The stereotypes of young people, particularly teenagers, are that they are disengaged from society, and not focused on national, let alone international, issues. But that couldn’t be further from the truth. For the last four years, our research group WISERDEducation has been surveying students at primary and secondary schools across Wales about aspects of their lives, education and perceptions of the wider world. In 2016 we asked almost 700 secondary school students (aged 13 to 18-years-old) what they considered to be “the most important problem facing Europe today”, to see whether their perceptions differed from adults’, and also whether views varied by age. The students were given nine different problems to choose from: climate change, economic instability, international terrorism, poverty, war, availability of energy, population growth, spread of nuclear weapons and infectious diseases. The chart below shows the proportion of students who selected the five most popular options. The remaining options, grouped as “other”, were chosen by very few participants, under 20% across all year groups. The chart below also excludes those who answered “don’t know”. International terrorism dominated as the greatest problem for Europe among our participants. But looking at different school year groups, a more nuanced picture emerged. Of Year 9 students (13 to 14-years-old), 44% considered terrorism to be the biggest problem, but this rate fell to 33% of Year 11 students (15 to 16-years-old). For Year 13 students (17 to 18-years-old), the percentage who thought terrorism was the biggest problem was much lower, at 20%. For the older students, terrorism was displaced by economic instability as the most significant problem facing Europe – which may reflect the fact that employment and the economy were becoming more relevant to them as they came to the end of their school careers. However, while economic instability topped the list for this cohort, no single problem dominated for the Year 13 group. Students’ concerns were clustered around a number of key issues, including terrorism, climate change and poverty. Interestingly, the older students were more likely to see climate change as the most important problem for Europe. Only 12% of Year 9 and 11% of Year 11 students noted climate change as their greatest concern, but this jumped to 18% among Year 13 students. In fact, this was only slightly lower than the 20% of Year 13 students who saw terrorism as the most significant problem. One reason that such a high proportion of students may have selected international terrorism as the most pressing issue facing Europe may have been the timing of our research. Students were surveyed in spring 2016, soon after attacks in Paris. In the month following the attacks, the children’s helpline, Childline, reported a surge in calls from young people anxious about the possibility of a similar attack in Britain. Previous research has also found that people tend to prioritise threats that are physically and temporally close to them. Terrorist attacks may also be seen as more threatening in general because they have clear perpetrators. By contrast no one group or individual can be blamed for climate change, making it seem less tangible as a threat. This is, of course, hugely problematic considering the large body of evidence that shows that climate change is already happening, and that other threats such as international terrorism may be linked to the disruption caused by global warming. In the context of research on the threats to Europe – in which international terrorism routinely tops the list of concerns – the surprising finding from our survey is that such a high proportion of Year 13 students considered climate change to be a pressing issue, more so than found in some studies of adults’ views.  A recent YouGov survey found that Britons are among the least concerned in the world about climate change, with only 12.8% selecting it as their most pressing issue. Considering that 18% of people aged 17 to 18-years-old in our 2016 survey believed it to be the most important issue facing Europe, and that the older the students were, the more likely they were to prioritise climate change, it seems that attitudes may be changing among the next generation of young adults."
